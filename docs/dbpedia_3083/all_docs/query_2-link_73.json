        "text": "Hey man, evening on the ground\n\nAnd there is no one else around\n\nSo you will blame me, blame me for the rocks\n\nAnd baby bones and broken lock\n\nOn our garden, garden wall of Eden\n\nFull of spider bites and all your lovers\n\nWe were, we were born to fuck each other\n\nOne way or another\n\n- “Evening on the Ground (Lilith’s Song)” by Iron and Wine\n\nIt had been a while since the last time she fed, so she was hungry. Under such a righteous banner, Mikasa has justified some terrible things. As a succubus, perhaps this is just in her nature.\n\nWhat exactly she’s hungry for, Mikasa isn’t quite sure. Being a succubus isn’t something one receives a lot of instruction on what she’s been able to find has been on the sketchiest parts of the internet. Dark Web message boards where jilted exes talk about buying curses to put on their loved ones to ensure one morning they wake up something other than human. Whoever did this to her four short years ago must’ve paid a pretty penny, because Mikasa is still stuck in this state with no signs of reemerging as a normal human woman.\n\nNot that being a succubus is that different from how her life used to be. Her mother was beautiful, especially for the remote mountain town she’d grown up in. Mikasa had always felt her beauty was an extension of that. Such things became of greater concern when her father was killed in a robbery gone wrong. Without his income as a lumberman, Mikasa and her mother were forced to move into a one bedroom apartment. How they came to afford that, her mother never told her.\n\nEven at the young age of nine, Mikasa was able to deduce that it had something to do with the dates she went on with men who her mother never introduced her to. In this, she had learned the power of beauty, even if it was in the darkest of ways.\n\nPerhaps, the hardest thing to figure out, at least initially, was finding a way to feed.\n\nShe used to go on a lot of dates, trying to find someone whose dreams she wouldn’t mind invading, at least for a night. Even if the sex she had with these men only occurred in their dreams, that didn’t mean that it didn’t feel real for her. Or at least, real enough that she preferred having it with someone she was attracted to.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t long before she found that dating was not a good way to find such people, especially in the small town she’d grown up in. She had no choice but to flee for larger pastures ending up in Shiganshina, the closest big city that finally boasted a male population large enough that she would never be able to drain it completely.\n\nHere, she’s decided to take a different approach. Instead of meeting her potential victims in person, she’s turned to the internet, more specifically, the numerous camgirl websites that boast “barely legal Eldian hotties” or “Paradis Island devil girls.” Some expect more innocence from her, which is less degrading but somehow more humanizing, while others have at least the vague tinge of empowerment while requiring her to accept being called a slut by someone with the username “YmirsSlave43.”\n\nThese men, she’s been less precious with. Not intentionally malicious, more like careless. It’s nice to let loose after keeping her hunger tamped down for so long. Besides, once you have someone’s credit card information, it’s easy to figure out everything else. All it takes for her to worm into a man’s mind when he goes to sleep was prolonged eye contact and sexual attraction.\n\nWhile working as a camgirl, it has been easy to find both of these in the comfort of her home. And because of that, she could afford to be picky. Or at least, her last couple sojourns into the dens of male loneliness had made her want to be. On the day she stumbled on Eren Jaeger’s (otherwise known as jaeger_bomb69) profile, it had been six days since she’d found a victim worth draining. No longer was she able to maintain the thin sheen of magic that afforded her a normal appearance. Black horns, curved and fearsome like the devils of Marleyan mythology before they replaced them with Eldians, along with bright red eyes and fangs that have a tendency of nicking her bottom lip.\n\nHer otherworldly beauty and knack for seduction remain available for her use. But, if she doesn’t feed in the next couple days, she’ll sprout black, leathery wings, like a bat, and usually a nice smile and a sensual gaze wasn’t enough to cancel that out. So while her mouse hovers over his profile, she cannot help but think about the dire nature of her circumstances and the quickest way to ameliorate them.\n\nBesides, if she moved her cursor away from it, she might’ve been forced to look at herself. Mikasa knew from experience that it was best to keep that to a minimum. She saw glimpses of it enough out of the corner of her eye that she knew what it looked like. She’d dimmed the lights in her apartment and the light that did find its way to her came only from lamps covered in red scarves.\n\nHer makeup – bright red lipstick, smokey black eyeshadow, and winged eyeliner – was done in a far more dramatic fashion than she ever did it when she left the house on her own accord. But she liked the power it leant her, especially when she’d had to spend an extra thirty minutes putting her hair into pigtails in order to accommodate her horns. Around her neck she wore an black leather choker with an o-ring sewn into the middle of it. Her outfit was simple, a low-cut, lacy black dress whose spaghetti straps were always slipping down her shoulders.\n\nWhen she signs into her chatroom, she receives a rush of emojis in the chat, including eggplant, heart eyes, and purple smiling devils, which means she’s done a decent job. She knows how to play it up, curling her fist and giving a playful hiss to the camera. Distantly, she can feel her pride sustaining a significant blow but, typically, feeding and the thrill of the hunt help with that.\n\n“Hey guys, what’s up?” she says, adding insult to injury by speaking in the highest voice that she could muster.\n\nShe has a set choreography that she goes through. First, making sure she’s sitting so her breasts are squished together as she scrolled through her inbox, seeing if anyone who was currently present has ever asked her for a private show. For some reason, her eyes are immediately drawn to his username: jaeger_bomb69. That, and he actually has a picture of himself attached to his profile, which reveals him to be pretty in a boyish way.\n\nHis jaw is sharp enough to cut glass and there’s an appealing sort of coldness to his eyes. Her body responds to him almost immediately, and she can feel her powers increasing, if only because she’s found a target who’s worthy of them. Or at least, who inspired enough sexual attraction in her that she wants to use them.\n\nHer interest must’ve shown on her face. As if her body was primed to notice him, his username flickered in the whitespace of the chatroom. It says: “wish i was the one making u blush like that <3.”\n\nStupid, blunt, and boyish, but it ignites a sweet fire in her, one that she doesn’t want to put out just yet. With an impish grin on her face that’s at least a little genuine, she navigates her cursor over to the message that he sent her where he told her she was the prettiest demon he’d ever seen and that he’d do anything to be possessed by her.\n\nIf only he knew what he was signing up for.\n\nMikasa did her best to swallow her guilt as she typed a short message asking if he wanted a private show. His reply came almost immediately: “duh. can’t w8.”\n\nHe’s even more handsome on video chat. Wherever he is, it’s dimly lit, grungy in an interesting sort of way. His face, which had been beautifully on its own, is framed beautifully by his hair. Long and shaggy, it hung around his face like curtains that had a certain rustic grace.\n\nHe leans in close to the camera, letting her see that he had a gold hoop threaded through his nose. It brings out his eyes. He’s wearing a well-fitted t-shirt for a band that she doesn’t recognize and already knew, Mikasa knows deep in her bones that he would’ve been her type in that brief period of her life when she’d had the luxury of having options.\n\n“You’re too fuckin’ pretty. How are you real?”\n\nIt’s rare that Mikasa blushes in encounters such as these. Typically, they were stilted and awkward, requiring her to wear whatever mask fit her current disguise. Since she was feigning at sexy otherworldly demon girl tonight, her plan was to play everything mean and mischievous, maybe even letting a bit of her magic traipse across the psychic connection that opened up between her and men when they were attracted to her. The more attracted to her, the stronger it was.\n\nBut she doesn’t want to do that with Eren. Not when her smile seemed to inspire such ardor in him that he ends up admitting that he’s been jerking off to her videos for months.. He isn’t the first customer to have told her this; they often did. But there’s this boyish earnestness in the way he says it that lights her up from the inside.\n\n“What video did you like best?” she asks, surprised by how genuinely she wanted to know his answer.\n\nIt’s cute how much thought he puts into it. The way his brow wrinkled with thought. “Uh, I really like when you fuck yourself with that uh…purple dildo.” His gaze flicks away from her like he wants to say more but doesn't know if he should . A measure of restraint not shown by most men she invited to private shows, making her want to know more.\n\n“Why that one specifically?”\n\nIt surprises her that a boy like him could manage to look sheepish. “Uh, because it’s around the same size as my cock.”\n\nIt’s a statement so startling she didn’t know what to do with it. Her purple dildo is big. Not unrealistically huge. But big enough that she only used it when the occasion called for it, in part because of the vicious intensity of the orgasms it gave her. Something about the spot it touches inside her electrified her and she tends to make enough money off those videos that she doesn’t have to work for weeks and could focus on hunting instead.\n\n“Oh,” she says, losing her grip on her put-on persona almost entirely. But her insides helpfully pulse with hunger right at that moment, reminding her of what she’d come here to do. The more intense an attraction that she’s able to string between the two of them, the easier it’ll be for her to find him in his dreams. Or at least, that’s what she tells herself as she slips back on her sensual disguise. “Do you want to show it to me?”\n\nHe looked around himself like he was afraid he was being pranked. “Is that allowed?”\n\nShe finds herself smiling. A real grin, the kind she rarely gives to the webcam. “I’m allowing it,” she said. “Besides, if you show me yours, I’ll show you mine.\n\nHis eyes widen. It’s precious, making her smile stick to her face without her even meaning it to. Enough that her fangs are sticking out but he doesn’t seem to mind. Then, what she said seems to dawn on him all at once, and with frantic, impatient fingers, he goes to work undoing his belt and jeans.\n\nMikasa has to remind herself to get undressed too. Usually, such a thing came second nature, the end that she was always hurtling toward. Being a succubus has taught her not to be precious with her body. But under Eren’s gaze, she feels something almost like shyness. Girlish enough to make her blush even more as she sheds her skimpy dress.\n\nThe lingerie set she’s wearing is the one she relied upon when she really needed to feed: a black lace bra and thong that had heart-cut outs over the nipples and right above her slit. Leaving little to the imagination, especially with the way her camera’s positioned so it has a perfect view of her pussy.\n\n“Holy shit,” she hears him saying.\n\nOnly then does she let herself see him and how right he was. His cock sits thick and hard in his fist, making it clear that its encroaching size wasn’t an optical illusion. Want stirs in her gut, making her feel funny as she watches him use the pre-cum that was beading at the head of his dick to relieve the friction of his hand. All the while, his eyes are fixed at the little heart above her shaved pussy.\n\nMany men have looked at her. But none of them have made her feel like this: forcing her to experience genuine arousal by how beautiful they were to her.. Never has she been so wet while on camera. She can feel the lips of her cunt, sticking to the cheap satin of her underwear as she tries to get comfortable looking at him like this.\n\n“I want you to jerk off for me,” she says, surprised by how much she means it.\n\nPerhaps the best part is the way he grinned as he does as she asks. Unconsciously, her mouth waters as he drags his hand along the shaft again. Reminding her of how thick it is, even letting his thumb catch along one of the more prominent veins. Forcing her to see how much pre-cum had gathered at the tip, no doubt because of her.\n\n“Like this?” he asked with eyes clouded with arousal, his eyes still fixed to the heart above her pussy. It’s only through the powers she’d been cursed with that she was able to regain her composure. Has she ever thought a cock so pretty before? Found something so attractive about the way it looks in a hand, if only because she knows with certainty that its hardness was because of her?\n\nOr is it that he knew he’s pretty and doesn’t mind showing it off, just like she’s learned to do with her own body? Her awe must’ve shown on her face because when her eyes focus on his again, he’s smirking. “Your turn,” he says, with an entitled jerk of his chin. She can’t blame him. This is, technically, what he has paid for. With practiced ease, she pulls the crotch of her underwear to the side.\n\nFor some reason, the air grates on the sensitive skin of her pussy. Maybe because she’s just wetter than usual. Whatever the reason, she lets out a hiss after a few moments, trying to make sense of the frustrating combination of feelings that were coursing through her body.\n\nThe boy in front of her doesn’t notice.. His eyes are fixed between her legs, like he can’t believe what he was seeing. Like it’s something more than pussy but instead, an object of reverence, of worship.\n\n“Fuckin’ christ. You’re pretty everywhere.” He almost hit his forehead on his laptop screen with how close he got to the camera.\n\nMikasa flushes. “Why aren’t you doing what I told you to do?” she says, trying her best to sound bossy no matter how flustered she is. From the way he smiles, she has a feeling that she isn’t fully successful.\n\nStill, he starts to pump his hand up and down his cock. Slow and careful so she could see the way the pre-cum spread down the head of his cock to slick his shaft.\n\nNever has she found the act so transfixing. Reminding her of all the empty space she had in her body and how perfectly his cock could fill them. She starts touching herself, not because it was what he’s paid for, but to relieve the ache that he’s awoken in her. Her fingers found her clit gracelessly, with none of the usual titillating choreography, pinching it between her fingers so she could think straight. But she could feel the heat of Eren’s graze on her, reigniting whatever fire she’d managed to put out.\n\n“Fuck, are you as turned on as I am?” he said, his voice growing gritty.\n\nMikasa’s body answered for her first once she finally was able to fit a finger inside herself. Even with how tight she was, it slipped in easily, aided by the arousal that clung to her finger as she pulled it out. Remembering herself and what it was she was supposed to do, she held the finger close to the camera, so he could see how it glittered with her wetness, enough of it that it caught in the light.\n\n“What do you think?” she manages in a breathy whisper.\n\n“Holy fucking shit. You’re the hottest girl in the world. You know that, right?”\n\nThe earnestness of his words shocked a laugh out of her. “You keep distracting me,” she said in faux-exasperation, her fingers finding their way to her clit again. This time, she started to rub in earnest, needing to relieve some of the ache. Her eyes flickered closed for a moment with pleasure. When they reopened, his eyes were fixed to her pussy again, his hand moving up and down on his cock with an unconscious ease.\n\nShe didn’t know how long they spent like that, watching each other with rapt attention. All she knew was that she couldn’t get enough of the sight of him. “What’s your name?” she heard herself asking, wanting something to call him in her head other than jaegerbomb69.\n\n“Eren,” he replied, like he needed her to know it. “My name is Eren.”\n\nHe didn’t ask for hers in return. He probably figured she kept it secret for a reason. And the understanding in this gesture endeared him to him, albeit in a different way than the way it felt to watch him jerk himself off for her. “Can you fuck yourself with your finger again?” he said, something boyishly sheepish about the way the words fell from his mouth. That, and the tight grip he had on his cock, ensured that just one finger wasn’t enough.\n\nShe slipped two in immediately. The relief of being filled, even in this meager way, shivered through her whole body, making a low moan drop from her mouth. Immediately, she capitalized on it by using her other hand to toy with her clit. “Can you do another?” he asked and she did as he asked immediately.\n\nAnd at no point did this, or any of the other things she’d done for his enjoyment had felt like a chore. Not when she’d been able to bask in the bright heat of his admiration, growing more and more potent by the second. So when he asked her if she could come at the same time that he did, she didn’t give her usual speech about how she didn’t like to make promises, especially ones she couldn’t keep.\n\nShe was too close to coming for that. All she could do was give him a little nod, eyes falling closed as a particularly devious wave of pleasure stoked by the intent way he was watching her threatened to swallow her whole. “Holy shit, holy fucking shit,” she heard him say. It took all of the stamina she’d developed in this line of work to hold her ecstasy at bay so she could see the painful-looking grip he had on his cock, thumbing at the base of it with one of his thumbs, a reflexive movement clearly born out of need and the haze of orgasm.\n\nThe second his dick began to jerk in his hand, she was possessed by the thought of what that would feel like inside her. In real life, not in dreams. Her insides pulsed at the thought, allowing one of her fingers to graze her g-spot. With a pitiful whimper, Mikasa was pulled into the undertow of her orgasm, her eyelids emblazoned with the image of Eren and how good he’d been for her.\n\nAfter perhaps too long, she finally surfaced, his eyes sliding open lazily. Eren was looking at her, something soft and wonderful about his gaze. “That was a goddamn religious experience. You should raise your prices,” he said with a teasing smile. Before he signed off, he gave her a hefty tip and a promise that he’d be reaching out again. And she knew then, deep in the most cursed depths of her heart, that one night in his dreams would not be enough.\n\nOn the first night that Eren dreams of the cam girl known as yrdemongf666, he’s chasing her through a forest. She’s wearing something dark, silky, and skimpy, and it keeps catching on branches and trees. Why exactly he’s chasing her, he doesn’t know, only that he’s dressed in finery and there’s a burning hunger in his chest that he knows can only be satisfied by capture, possession, all of the darkest points of his nature. There are moments when they’re running through the shadows of the forest where something primal overtakes him and it’s like they’re two animals caught in the sorry tragedy of natural selection and the only thing that matters to him is the pale line of her back, glinting through the night like a rabbit’s cottony tail.\n\nSomehow, he corners her in a clearing. Somewhere illuminated by moonlight. Startling her enough that he’s able to catch up with her, reaching out and grabbing her by the shoulder. When he spins her around, her beauty overwhelms him, something about it otherworldly in the hazy moonglow of his dream.\n\n“It’s you,” he says, cupping her face in her hands.\n\nThe animal truth of her heartbeat hammers against his palm, made more intense by his proximity to her jugular. She hisses, baring her fanged teeth. It makes his dick twitch, knowing what capacity she has to hurt him. “I’ve caught you,” he threatens and in the strange way of dreamlogic, this makes it true, and the tension between them rises. Her red eyes – beautiful as a blood moon – glint in the light like she can read his mind. Still, she puts up an appropriate amount of a fight as he forces her to her knees. Glaring up at him in a way that makes him even harder, making it impossible to keep his arousal restrained for much longer.\n\nJust like when he did it during the day, her eyes got unspeakably wide once he revealed himself to her. Something about her – the wide set of her legs and desperate cast of her eyes letting him know that she wants him to be rough with her. He smiles, gripping her hair in his hand and using it to tilt her head upwards as he feeds her his cock.\n\n“Be careful, baby,” he says, sounding more than a little mean.\n\nThe cam girl presses a chaste kiss to the head of his cock. “Not too careful, though,” she replies, looking him in the eye as she scrapes her fangs gently against the sensitive flesh that she just kissed. The sound he makes is pulled straight from his gut, gritty and primal. More pre-cum spurts from his teeth and she laps it up greedily.\n\n“See,” she says, with an incandescent glimmer in her eye. “I know what you like.”\n\nBefore he can ask how she came by this knowledge, she envelops the head of his cock in her mouth, stealing his capacity for speech. Then, with practiced ease, she works the length of him down her throat, making direct eye contact with him as she does it. Her teeth tease the veins along his shaft, making his movements sharp and jerky. He doesn’t know how long she sucks him off for, especially with what a good time she seems to have doing it.\n\nAll Eren knows is when he wakes up the next morning, his boxers are cum-stained like he’s a teenager again. And yeah, he feels a little weird the next morning. But he also went out with his co-workers after the restaurant where he worked as a line cook closed and drank way too much. It must just be a hangover, he tells himself, and then he doesn’t think of the dream again, until he’s falling under the spell of sleep.\n\nAnd again, she’s in his dreams. Even though he never got a chance to send her a message all day. Not after he’d slept in so late. But he had thought about her a lot and the way the dream iteration of her used her fangs to torture him. So he isn’t exactly unhappy to see her again. As is the way with dreams, he emerges in a situation that’s already in progress. The cam girl is sitting across from him on his bed in a room that resembles his childhood bedroom. She’s maybe eighteen or nineteen, and a voice in his head tells her this is the summer after she left for college.\n\nIn this dream, he feels the pressure of childhood memories that feel disturbingly real. Through them, he learns that her name is Mikasa. He doesn’t know how he learns this, only that it seems to pass between them when this iteration of her – short-haired and pink cheeked – leans in for a kiss. “I thought about doing this to you all year,” she says, and this time, she’s the forward one, taking his face in her hand.\n\nWhen their lips touch, a million memories that belong to this world flash before his eyes. Like how he and Mikasa had grown up side by side as neighbors. Somehow, he’d always been in love with her, he’d just never found a way to say it and she never got up the nerve either. But she’d left for college and this had made some truths clear to him that he couldn’t ignore like how his life was colorless without her in it. So when she made it home for summer break, he finally confessed his feelings and it had led them here.\n\nHere, her kiss is fumbling and sweet. He has to guide her, flicking his tongue against her lips so she opens her mouth to him. Then, he smiles at how quickly her lips part for him, like she’s been waiting to do this her whole life. It’s early summer when it’s still cold. She’s wearing a sweatshirt and a pair of short shorts. It’s easier for him to pull her closer to him, the weight of their combined bodies making them fall against the bed.\n\nLike a tractor beam, his cock seeks out the soft heat of her pussy, barely hidden by the thin fabric of her shorts. She gasps when they make contact and dives into kissing him with newfound hunger. Gasping into his mouth when he starts to grind against her, the friction catching on somewhere nice.\n\nMikasa moans into his mouth, reciprocating his movements with bold, little circles of her hips. Like she’s remembering something learned in another life. Eren grasps her hips with one hand, giving her some leverage so she can grind against him more intently.\n\n“Eren,” she sighs against his lips. “Eren.”\n\nWhen he wakes, he has a headache. The previous night, he indulged in weed instead of alcohol, hoping that would make his sleep more restful. But yet again, he has to drag himself through his morning routine, barely making it to the kitchen in time for his shift as the prep cook.\n\n“You look like shit,” Levi, the sous chef says as soon as Eren arrives. “You know, you can’t be young and stupid forever.” Eren begs to differ but is too tired to fight with him. Besides, when he sees his reflection in the stainless steel hood of the station he’s working at today, he sees that Levi might have a point.\n\nIn order to prevent himself from having another dream that’s so arousing that he’s willing to sleep the whole morning in order to keep it alive for a little bit longer, he jerks off before bed. But even with his base desires satiated, he still trips into another dream world where she’s waiting for him. In this one, the room they’re in shifts around them. After a few seconds of investigation, Eren finds that they’re on a boat from olden times.\n\nHe looks down at his body and sees that he’s dressed in garb that can only belong to a pirate. His hair is loose and wild around his face. His vision is diminished and when he lifts his hand to touch his face, he finds that one of his eyes has been replaced by an eyepatch. But when he notices that Mikasa is tied to the chair in front of him – her name comes to him with half-remembered ease – something about the world around him sharpens and he can see her clearly.\n\nShe’s wearing a corset dress in dark red. Her tits sit high, resting just below her chin. The fabric its made out of glimmers with a subtle ornate pattern that resembles the fleur des lis. She must be his hostage, captured in order to enable him to exact some exorbitant fee from the noble family that she is a bastard daughter of.\n\n“I’ll never bend to your will. I hate you,” she says, with teary gray eyes. Eren grasps her face in his hand. For some reason, he knows this is what the moment demands of him.\n\n“You’re lying,” he says, gripping her face tight enough that it must hurt. His eyes flick downward, taking in how the boning of her dress pushes her tits up so it’s hard not to look at her cleavage. Possessed by a dark urge, he reaches out with his sword and drags it along the strings and hooks that bind her dress. “Even if you pretend not to want me, your body says otherwise.”\n\nHer arms are bound so there’s nothing stopping him when he takes another step closer. He taps the inside of her knee with the blade of his sword. “Open,” he says, a threat insinuated in the way he drags the edge of his blade along her soft skin. “Let me see how much you really hate me.”\n\nMikasa glares at him, a tantalizing amount of fight in her eyes. “No.”\n\nAs gently as he can manage it, he digs the edge of his blade into the precious pale flesh of her inner thigh. His hostage whimpers, especially once he begins to draw blood. He makes slow progress down her downy flesh, splitting it open in a long, red line. It makes his mouth water to see it. To taste the combined smell of her arousal and and blood on the air. Sweet and rich as honey from a foreign land.\n\n“Now, Mikasa,” he says, his blade getting dangerously close to the edge of her garter belt that holds up her tights.\n\nFinally, she lets her thighs fall open, revealing her pussy to him. It’s just like he remembers it from the private show she gave him, pink and shimmering with arousal. Her clit is so swollen it must hurt, wetness dripping from her entrance like water from a spirited stream. Sensitive enough that the brush of air that comes with his exhale is enough to have her kicking her hips up.\n\nHis gaze flicks to the cut he’d torn into her skin. It is a superficial one, but because of how much blood travels through this part of her body, making her pussy pink and swollen like it was when she was performing for him. Unable to help himself, he starts to lick the wound he made in her, starting where the bleeding has already been stemmed by time. Her skin jumps beneath the tip of his tongue. The metallic edge of her lightly dried blood makes his teeth ring as he makes his way back to her pussy again.\n\n“No, your little cunt doesn’t seem to hate me at all,” Eren says before pressing his mouth to her in an open-mouthed kiss. From there, he takes his time drawing his tongue up and down the length of her. Taking the time to tease the tip of his tongue into her little hole or suck her clit into his mouth with direct and piercing intensity that her chair shifted beneath him.\n\nAll the while his cock pulses, hard and throbbing in his pants, reminding him that he hasn’t fucked her yet. Like it’s something that his dreams aren’t ready to give him yet. And the morning following the realest dream he’s ever had, Eren finally feels as shitty as he looks. Waking up at 11am with his whole body aching and a shivery sort of feeling spreading through his body.\n\nHe texts Floch to see if he can cover his shift. Thankfully, his younger co-worker is weirdly obsessed with him, and willing to do whatever he says. Still, Levi texts him as well with a quick and curt “get better, shithead” and a threat that better come in tomorrow.\n\nOnce his day at home is secured, Eren wanders into the kitchen with his comforter wrapped tightly around him, in part because he’s only wearing his boxers and in part because he has the chills. Jean’s sitting at the breakfast bar, drinking a mug of coffee. Even though they’re close friends, he can tell that Jean is taking at least some pleasure in Eren’s discomfort.\n\n“I’ve always hoped that I’d be around for when your self-destructive lifestyle caught up with you,” the blonde-haired man says, smirking at Eren over the rim of his ceramic cup. Instead of answering him verbally, Eren just flips him off on his way to get a Pop-Tart.\n\nBut Jean’s words stick with him for the rest of the day, made more intense by the fact that he spends the rest of the day in the dark of his room. Maybe he’s been living too fast and hard. He’s twenty-four now. His father disowned him three years ago and his life is no more together than it was when he dropped out of college in order to pursue his dream of cooking at the best restaurants in Shiganshina. It’s required a lot of him: late nights that often become early mornings, a smoking habit that he keeps up mostly because it makes his breaks more bearable. That, and he ends up getting drunk with his co-workers most nights. Connie, his other roommate, works at the restaurant too – a fine dining farm-to-table establishment called “Scout Regiment,” with the renowned Erwin Smith at the helm as the executive chef.\n\nIt’s a dream come true in the form of a job. But Eren has been working as a line/prep cook at Scout Regiment for over a year and hasn’t seen much advancement. That, and he works so much that he barely has time to hang out with his friends or even meet a girl. Making him reliant on websites that hosted cam girls such as yrdemongf666(is her name also Mikasa, he finds himself wondering) and the more intimate services that they offer.\n\nThat night, she doesn’t appear in his dreams and he wakes up feeling better than he has in days. He’s able to make it into work and do a good enough job that Levi gives him a hard clap on the back on his way out of the kitchen that night. It’s hard to turn down Connie and Floch’s insistence that they should get drinks after to celebrate such a good shift. But Eren is still spooked enough that he heads home early, only to be disappointed when yrdemongf666 or the version of her called Mikasa are once again absent from his dreams.\n\nThe next morning, he feels great. But it doesn’t even fucking matter, not when his angel of the night has decided to abandon him. Almost unconsciously, he finds himself drawn to his laptop, sitting on his desk. His cursor moves quickly, finding its way to yrdemongf666’s profile before he can stop himself. From there, it’s easy to find his way where he can DM her. Before he can lose his nerve, he types out a message and hits send. Once it’s done, his heart pounds in his ears as Eren realizes what he’s just done and how it can never be taken back.\n\nAll he can do is pray that she’s been dreaming of him too.\n\nThough she didn’t want to believe it first, it’s now clear to Mikasa that she’s in over her head. She reads Eren’s message for the fifth time, trying to figure out how she can possibly respond to it.\n\nhey,\n\nsry if this is weird but i can’t stop thinking about you. probably b/c i can’t stop dreaming about you. can you plz put me out of my misery? if there’s any world where you’d consider going on a date with me, meet me at a record store called walls of maria in downtown shiganshina (if that’s rly where you live, lol) next saturday at 11am.\n\nyours,\n\neren.\n\nUncertainty swirling through her gut, she navigates her cursor over to the succubus group chat who she’s been replying upon heavily since she let the freight train that is Eren Jaeger collide with her life. What started out as a target who she wouldn’t mind feeding on a couple of times has spiraled so utterly out of control, the version of herself that existed back then, embodied by whatever message she’d sent him before this one thanking him for the generous tip, seems like a different person altogether.\n\nBut how could she have known what was going to happen when she’d never experienced anything like it? The attraction that stretched between the two of them after their initial meeting thrummed with a pulse all its own, gnawing at Mikasa’s insides with an unexpected hunger. The first night, she played with her food far longer than she usually did, leading him through a maze just because she actually experienced fear at the thud of his feet coming after her and she liked the way it felt.\n\nThe second night, however, had been a mistake. She knew that it was wrong to feed on him two nights in a row. Especially when one night had been enough to return the bulk of her powers. But as sleep crested over here, she felt this deep, dark pull toward him and told herself that one more night of feeding wouldn’t do any harm.\n\nEspecially with how vigorous and youthful his spirit was, the sheer ferocity of his sex drive. In part, the reason why she was so well off after one feeding was because he was able to stand so much more than most men, letting her fall deeper and deeper down the abyss made by their combined depravity. That, and the same things seemed to get both of them hot, which created a feedback loop that was difficult for her to tear herself away from, even if it was for his good.\n\nThe following evening, when she made a concerted effort not to end up in Eren Jaeger’s dreams, she still found her way there, almost as if there was something like fate tying them together. In the morning, she texted her group chat, hoping that he didn’t feel too terrible today. Thankfully, Hanji, who had dedicated themselves the resident expert of the small group had an answer. Apparently, if someone who was being fed upon had a particularly strong attraction to the succubus who had made a meal of them, they could unknowingly call upon the succubus through the want woven through their own dreams.\n\nSomeone must really like you, Mikasa, Hanji said with a teasing emoji, leading to Sasha joining in on the fun.\n\nWhat? No, Mikasa replied, glad that their conversation was taking place over text message so no one could see how fiercely she was blushing. Unfortunately, Sasha was a friend from childhood who had ended up similarly afflicted, and she knew Mikasa well enough to tell when she was blushing even if she wasn’t able to say it in person.\n\nmika def likes him 2, her friend chimed in, forcing Mikasa to storm away from her computer in embarrassment.\n\nStill, she knows that they are the only people who might have some insight into her current situation and whether it’s possible for anything good to come of it. Other than Hanji and Sasha, there’s Pieck, all of whom have been cursed for about as long as Mikasa has been. Historia is a recent addition, having found their information on the same dark web forum that Mikasa had stumbled upon in one of her early days of being cursed, wracked with abject desperation. They know little about each other’s lives apart from their shared affliction.\n\nSo she doesn’t know if they’ve found love or something like it. If such a thing is even possible. She’s never even cared before. In order to ensure that she didn’t end up feeding on him again when he was week, she had to stay up late, ensuring that by the time she was asleep, he was in a deeper state, so their dream worlds wouldn’t try to find a way to overlap. It was difficult, and required her waking up repeatedly throughout the night.\n\nYet, she can’t stand the idea of her causing him any more strife. Especially when he’s written her such a sweet message, innocent and affectionate. Something a monster like her doesn’t deserve. She takes a screenshot of it and sends it to the group chat, chewing on her bottom lip as she does so.\n\nwhat should i do?, she adds, though she regrets it as soon as she sees numerous speech bubbles appearing underneath her message, suggesting that at least three of her friends are typing her a response.\n\nomg, he’s alive? you found yourself a keeper, Pieck types out, adding a winky face. Hanji exclamation reacts to her response before adding their own.\n\nThe fact that he’s recovered this quickly is remarkable. And that he has such fond memories of you. Normally, after repeated feedings, the dreams we inflict tend to take on a more nightmarish character. It’s one of the few ways the body has to defend itself from us.\n\nmikasa, he’s in love w/u!!!!!! what’re u gonna do? Sasha adds immediately after and Mikasa feels her chest lighting up with the hope that her friends have given her.\n\nshould i do anything? i’m afraid i might hurt him :(\n\nHanji’s speech bubble lights up again and Mikasa watches it with anticipation in her throat. To her surprise, Historia, usually silent, starts typing a message as well. She finishes hers first: idk how or why, but if you really like someone and they really like you and if they have a lot of stamina…it’s harder to drain them. i know from personal experience lol.\n\nThis, of course, completely derails the conversation, for Hanji at least, because they cannot rest until they wring every bit of information out of Historia. Confirming that the otherwise quiet blonde has been dating a woman she once fed upon called Ymir. Mikasa watches the conversation unfold with intent eyes. She’s never imagined that some kind of happy ending could be possible.\n\nEventually, Hanji finds their way back to the point.\n\nYou know, what Historia’s talking about scans with other things I’ve found in my research. There does seem to be some protection that comes with a succubus’s affection. Something that can replenish the energy of the person that’s being fed on so they don’t endure ill effects. Especially if the person being fed upon has a, shall we say, large sexual appetite. Does that align with your experience, Historia?\n\nShyness finally catches up with Historia, making her answer Hanji’s question with a thumbs up. Anticipation buzzes inside her chest, making her feel crazy. Long ago, she’d given up on any semblance of happiness. Accepting a miserable, lonely existence so she wouldn’t be disappointed when she experienced it later. But now, for the first time, she’s able to see the vague shape of a bright future, taking shape in somewhere in the future where impossible and possible things collide.\n\nshould i go?\n\nThe agreement of her group chat is so resounding, her phone vibrates for a long time. It provides an assuring soundtrack as she tips out her response.\n\nsee you then <3\n\nThe day comes upon her quicker than Mikasa’s ready for. She goes back and forth about canceling it at least a dozen times, typically when she’s scouring her webcam chatroom for another victim so she doesn’t end up draining Eren half to death the minute they see each other in person. She’s heard of it happening before, especially in cases where the attraction between a succubus and whoever she’s feeding upon is greatly unmatched.\n\nBut whenever she thinks of canceling, she remembers the ease she felt with him in their first conversation. How blatant he was with his admiration, like he lost nothing from the vulnerability of it. And that’s rare to find in men, especially when one bears the curse that she does. Sometimes, she wonders if that’s the point.\n\nThe night before, Sasha comes over to eat pizza and watch a movie. Mikasa doesn’t understand how they both got so unlucky but in times like these, she can’t help but be grateful for it. They drink beer and watch a rom-com they’ve seen a million times. During all the especially cheesy parts, she has to focus to keep her eye on her television screen so she doesn’t react to all the embarrassing faces Sasha is making at her, no doubt in reference to who she’s meeting tomorrow. But for some reason, the anticipation of seeing him is sweet enough that she doesn’t even mind.\n\nIn the morning, Mikasa thankfully isn’t too hungover and has time to get ready before she meets him. In the time since she last fed on him, she’s starting to become hungry again. Unable to make her red eyes go away with magic, she uses contacts that mimic her normal eye color. Her fangs haven’t yet reemerged but when she presses a finger to the tip of her incisor, it brings a small bead of blood to the surface. No doubt, something she’ll have to be careful about.\n\nThankfully, her skin retains enough warmth that she’s able to feign at being a human, albeit a very pale one. Her wings aren’t in danger of making themselves known yet at least, though her back has been a little itchy. In order to play it safe, she wears a short black mini-skirt and crop top feigning enough at Victorian-era billowyness that she prays it doesn’t come off as too slutty. In order to downplay what else she has going on, her make-up is simple: bare face, dark eyes, with a glossy red lip.\n\nStill, when she sends a picture to Sasha on her way to meet up with Eren, she just responds with the word “bark” over and over again.\n\n“What does that even mean?” Mikasa mutters to herself as she makes her way to the nearby convenience store for an early breakfast. As soon as she opens the door, bells attached to the door ring, causing whoever’s currently standing in front of the cash register to turn their head.\n\nHer body knows who it is the second she lets the door fall closed behind her. Even more striking than she thought he’d be, Eren Jaeger stands there, a storm of feeling cresting over his face as he realizes that their date has started earlier than he expected. His hair is pulled away from his face in a haphazard bun, the strands that hang in his eyes making their green hue even more arresting. His white t-shirt and jeans cling to his muscles in a way that makes her mouth go dry, revealing the shitty tattoos that start at his wrist and leave little skin visible. Behind his ear, he has a cigarette, one that he no doubt planned to smoke on his walk to meet her. Maybe because he’s nervous.\n\nBut there is no one word to describe the expression on his face or the shimmer that his pheromones make in the air, telling the curse in Mikasa’s body that he’s easy prey. It’s like the sight of her has punched the breath out of his chest and the longer he looks at her, the harder it is for him to catch it.\n\n“Hi,” she manages, her voice high-pitched and shy, giving him a small wave.\n\n“Hi,” he says, his far too gritty to be used for a first meeting. His eyes drag over her body, his mouth falling open in obvious awe.\n\nThen, with the sound of the cash register dinging closed, they’re interrupted before things can get any worse. “Excuse me, sir? Your total is $5.32. Cash or card?” the older woman who’s working behind the cashier says brusquely.\n\nEren turns around to hand her his money, but Mikasa can still feel his attention stuck to her like it’s a thorn that’s run through her skin. She tries to grab her normal to-go breakfast, a drip coffee with an overly sweet muffin, but when she turns around, he’s there, waiting for her. Something intense and inscrutable about his expression that fills her chest cavity with butterflies, making her dizzy.\n\n“I’m gonna wait outside,” he says, before cutting his eyes away from her so quickly she can’t help but wonder if he’s afraid of what might happen if he looks at her for longer. When she makes her way outside with her items in a small paper bag, he’s somehow found an even more intense version of this look, perhaps made worse by the handful of minutes that he’s had to wait.\n\nHe’s leaning against a wall of an older building that’s catty-corner from the door of the convenience store, smoking a cigarette. The moment he registers her presence, he straightens to attention. “Sorry,” he says, no doubt reading the neutrality in her expression as displeasure with him smoking.\n\nTo correct his thinking as soon as possible, she closes the distance between them and holds out a hand, a silent request for a drag. Eren perks up immediately, handing the cigarette toward her. She picked up smoking in high school, before she was cursed. It had gone with her whole doomed goth girl vibe. That, and it really pissed off her parents. But once she became doomed in actuality, she found the past reminders of how she’d pissed her life away devastating instead of soothing, like coping mechanisms were supposed to be.\n\nIt’s worth it for the way he looks at her when she purses her lips to take a drag. The way his eyes follow the arc of her hand’s movement as she passes it back to him. “You’re even prettier in person,” he says, like this gesture has punched it out of him. “I didn’t even think that was possible.”\n\nDespite herself, Mikasa blushes. It must be in a way he likes because it emboldens him to keep talking. “I thought it would be weirder meeting up with someone I’d only talked to on the internet. But for some reason…” His mind seems to go elsewhere for a moment, taking his gaze too. But when it comes back to her, its even more smoldering than before. “I’ve dreamed about you so many times. In so many different ways. It’s like…”\n\n“We know each other already,” she adds, unable to keep herself from doing so. It’s like every opening he gives her makes her want to up the ante. She’s felt attraction before, in ways big and small, but never anything like this – the sensation that there is a part of her that has always been waiting for him and now that they’re close, it can’t help but reach out. Like it’s a reflex or instinct, the type of thing that can’t be controlled.\n\nAnd he seems to have a similar demon working inside him. One that makes him smile wide and vulnerable at her words. So thankful that he’s found someone that understands him. She opens her coffee and takes a swig, washing the taste of his cigarette out of her mouth. Trying not to think too much about how pressing her lips to it is the closest they’ve come to a kiss. Or at least, one in real life.\n\nBut as she looks at him, she cannot help but feel like those things that they did in their dreams are with them now. Corporeal and real, like memories from waking life or something even better. All the forms she’d taken were ones that she’d wanted to, tapping into some terrible, secreted part of her that was forgotten along the way. Someone who wants to be chased just as much as she wants to hunt, who likes to be made small in the shadow of a man who has filthy thoughts about her, who dreams of the precise marriage that can be made between pain and pleasure by the right sort of person. A person who looks like him, and gazes at her like this too, like he’s thinking about the same things she is.\n\nAnd maybe her reciprocation of his intensity is what makes him eliminate all the distance between them, drawing her in close enough for a kiss. “Is your name Mikasa?”\n\nShe’s fixed in place by the way he’s holding her in his thrall. Like he’s the one cursed with being the most alluring creature to walk the surface of the earth instead of him. It makes her feel mindless, crazy, like she’s about to do something terribly wrong.\n\nShe leans in a little closer. “Yes.”\n\nHis nostrils flare, a new determination about his brow. “Mikasa. I know I told you I had a whole date planned. And I do. I’m not a shithead, I promise. But the way you look right now…” He reaches out like he’s about to grab her by the waist but must think better of it. Making his hand fall in a clenched fist to his side. “I gotta be honest with you. I don’t think I’m gonna be able to last the whole date without doing something stupid.”\n\n“Like what?”\n\nFor a moment, he almost looks boyish. Innocent like a kid who’s finally gotten close with their crush. But then, he starts talking. “Fucking you right here in this alley. I want you so bad I don’t even know if I’d check beforehand to make sure no one could see us. I wouldn’t care. I practically don’t right now. I’m sorry… I really wanted to do this right.”\n\nOver the years she’s labored under this curse, she’s learned how to tell when the feelings that she stirs in a man are authentic or her creation alone. There is some element of her power, turning Eren into a slavering dog. But the majority of his feeling toward her comes from the guts of him, a place where she cannot touch.\n\nHe wants her. He really wants her. Before her conscience can catch up with her, she reaches for his hand. She intertwines their fingers together, close enough that she can feel the ricochet of his heartbeat against the knuckles of her fingers.\n\n“How close are we to your place?”\n\nEren’s eyes widen like he can’t believe what he’s hearing. “Uh…Five blocks.”\n\nHer grip on his hand tightens. “Mine is only two.”\n\nHis grip tightens reciprocally, enough for it to hurt. “Lead the way.”\n\nAs they make their way to her apartment, they maintain a speed that is quick but at least feigns at being casual. No matter how badly Mikasa can tell both of them want to take off in a sprint. With every passing moment that their palms spend pressed together, flashes of the dreams she pulled him into flash before her eyes. From the rapid beat of his pulse in his palm, it’s clear that his thoughts are following similar lines, or worse.\n\nAll she knows is that even in this fledgling beats of romance, she can tell that she can trust him with her body. When he touched her in his dreams, it was with knowledge, intention. The kind of touch that knows how to measure out pain and pleasure in the right quantities for a monster girl like her.\n\nShe keeps sneaking looks at him, noticing new things to become infatuated with. Sun has scattered freckles across the bridge of his nose, suggesting a childhood that was spent in the sun. It grips her violently – the urge to know about it and whatever else characterized the place he came from. Never has she wanted to know anything about the men she’s drained, worried about what might happen if something goes wrong.\n\nBut as they take the stairs to her third floor apartment two by two, she realizes with a startling certainty that there’s no limit to what she wants to know about him. Even if that might mean that he’ll want to learn about her in return. The thought makes her stumble a little as they take the final flight. To her surprise, Eren’s reaching out to steady her before she can fall.\n\n“Be careful. I need you in one piece,” he says, leading her the rest of the way. On anyone else, it might’ve been patronizing, but she can feel how much he wanted her in each word. The effort it’s taking for him to hold herself back. As she pulls her key from her purse, she can feel the heat of his body behind her, hot and abrasive. It makes her glad that she lives in the sort of apartment building that’s a converted Victorian house, because her studio is the only one that fits on this floor.\n\nA converted attic, most of the light comes through a skylight that’s in the middle of the room. Messy, with dishes in the sink and her bed unmade. As soon as the door falls closed behind them, her stupor is temporarily lifted by the realization that she probably isn’t making a particularly good impression. “Sorry about-” she starts to say but before she can finish, he’s spinning her around so she has no choice but to see how his eyes have darkened with desire.\n\n“Mikasa, I don’t give a shit. Now, where’s the chair you film your videos in?”\n\nShe finds herself surprisingly delighted by his dutiful viewership of her videos. They are a way to take the edge off her vicious sex drive, an evolutionary advantage of her curse that encouraged her to hunt. To think he’s taken such active pleasure in them stokes the prideful urge inside her that perhaps made someone think she deserved to be cursed to this frustrating affliction. Making her lead her to her gaming chair, the seat always at the perfect height to allow her pussy to be on perfect display.\n\nThat must be what he’s thinking about as he looks at the pastel pink chair in front of him. “You have no idea how many times I’ve jerked myself off, dreaming of eating your pretty little pussy while you sit here.”\n\nIn Mikasa, his words ignite a full-body shiver that’s impossible to hide. How connected she feels to him in this moment shakes her to her core. Like through the dreams she’s given him, they’ve come to inhabit one mind, growing a matching set of fantasies. It must show in her eyes, this bodily sort of recognition.\n\nNo doubt, it emboldens him. “If you’ve thought about it too, take off your underwear and sit on that chair like you do when you’re fucking the dildo that looks like mine.”\n\nMikasa’s eyes widen. The filthy intention in his words overwhelms any self-restraint she has. She slips her skimpy black lace underwear down her thighs. She steps out of them. She’s so wet that she can feel it between her thighs. At this realization, she flushes. More than she usually does, but not an embarrassing amount. Not yet, at least.\n\nBut all of that goes out the window when he makes his next request for her. “Give them to me. I want to see how wet you are.”\n\nMikasa tries to hide the depth of her blush by looking away from him as she gives him her soaked, black silk underwear that was definitely worn with the intention of him seeing them. All sense of her decorum is out the window when he brings them to his nose and inhales deeply.\n\nThe only way to describe the look on his face is drunk. “Keep them,” she says, goaded by his obvious adoration.\n\nHis eyes sparkle like he’s a kid that’s been awarded a shopping spree at a candy store. “I’ll jerk off with them thinking about this later,” he promises. Then, without another word, he drops to his knees in front of her. The chair she films her videos in is intentionally set higher than most. Still, he has to stoop a little to find his way between her thighs.\n\nMikasa watches, awestruck, as he takes a moment to just inhale her scent. She thinks she hears him mutter something like it’s even better than he remembers and it sends shivers down her spine, to learn that what happened in his dreams felt just as real to him as it felt to her. That had to mean something, right? A mutuality of desire making the connection between their minds more potent?\n\nBut before she can put those thoughts into action, Eren has overwhelmed her pussy with an open-mouthed kiss. Even lewder than anything they’d done together in the false romances she’d made for them. And usually, when she had sex with someone whose dreams she’d invaded, the sex that they had in real life – usually for feeding purposes – paled in comparison.\n\nNever in her wildest dreams could she have imagined this, Eren lashing her clit with his tongue so enthusiastically that she’s on the edge of coming almost immediately. He seems to be able to sense it, clenching her thighs and drawing her pussy even closer to his face. Making his assault on her pussy even more intense.\n\nShe can’t help but look down at him and the obvious pleasure he’s taking in eating her out. Something vicious and cruel about how he intensifies his assault on her clit just when she can tell she’s on the edge of an orgasm that she’d normally back away from, because of how shivery and light-headed it would make her feel. More than that, there is nothing of the strange sucking feeling she normally experiences while she’s letting a man eat her out for the purpose of feeding on him.\n\nBut Eren leaves her no choice but to leap off the edge willingly, the way his tongue is teasing its way across her clit and entrance with increasing rapidity leaving her no choice. “Eren,” she sobs, having no choice but to grind her pussy against his mouth.\n\nHer natural instinct to pull at his desire is met with an overflow of attraction to draw upon. Almost like they’ve entered a feedback loop that the two of them can exist in infinitely. Still, she lets her hands find their way through his hair, gently urging him away before it becomes too much for either of them. He doesn’t stop until she pulls.\n\n“Eren,” she says again, with a voice far more trembling than her pride normally allows. “Please, there’s something we need to talk about.” She told herself if she let it get this far, she’d at least give him a heads up about what he might be risking. Still, she can’t let him do something as risky as have sex with her without telling him the possible costs. Not when he’s been so good to her, given so much of himself to her without knowing it.\n\nWhen his face turns to her, it’s glossy with her release, to the point where he uses his tongue to catch some that’s in danger of dripping from his upper lip. Like her pleasure is so sacred to him, he can’t let any bit of it get away. “Can it wait?” he says, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. “Because, I’m pretty sure that whatever would happen to me if I don’t get to fuck you right now would be worse.”\n\nAs if to prove his point further, his hand falls to his crotch to palm his hard dick. He’s still on his knees but as she watches him, the image of his cock dawns on her violently and suddenly. Her mind swims with it, making it even harder to pull together the words that she knows she needs to say.\n\n“If we go any further, there’s something you need to know. Sleeping with me comes with risks–”\n\n“Mikasa, I gotta be honest. I can’t imagine any risk that I’d give a shit about. Like even if your pussy could kill me somehow, there’s no way I’m not fucking you in the next five minutes. You’ve infected my mind. I can’t stop thinking about you. I can’t stop dreaming about you. I might even be in love with you.” At his last admission, his face finally flushes, but he doesn’t look away from her, like he knows she’s the type of fearful creature who needs proof. And without knowing it, he’s given it to her, by admitting to dreaming of her without her interference, just because he wanted to see her so bad.\n\n“What do I do in your dreams?” she manages, focusing on the one part of his confession that she can wrap her mind around.\n\nEren smirks. “What do you think?” And then before she can respond, he’s kissing her, spreading her taste all over her tongue and teeth. The heady sweetness of her is overwhelmed by how ardently he kisses her, like it’s everything he’s ever dreamed of. Making it almost impossible for her to pull away from him but she manages it as best she can, placing a hand on his chest and pushing him away now that he’s at his full height again.\n\n“Eren, please,” she insists, so she can tell from the look in his eyes that her expression and plea have done little to cool his desire. If anything, they’ve made it worse, his pupils surrounded by a barely-there ring of green, making it even more imperative that she gets through to him. “I’m serious. Listen to me. I’m…” Her eyes scrunch close for a moment as she tries to find the right words. She’s never done this before. She doesn’t know how it’s supposed to go.\n\n“So fuckin’ hot it’s melted my brain?” Eren offers, unhelpfully. Still, it makes her smile enough that the next words she has to say come out easier.\n\n“A succubus.”\n\nHe tilted his head with the same innocent confusion of a dog who didn’t understand where its ball went after it’s hidden behind the owner’s back. “A what?”\n\nShe blushes, nervous enough that she lets her shyness win. “I know this might sound weird. But someone… someone cursed me. When I was a kid. I used to be normal like you but one day after high school graduation I woke up and I was…” She lets her defenses down, allowing him to see her for what she really is. Horned and red-eyed with the predator incisors to match, her skin so pale and milky that it glints in the late morning light in a way more eye-catching than normal human skin. “This.”\n\nShe watches with her heart in her throat as he takes in what she really is, eyes gliding over her skin slowly and intentionally, like his brain’s struggling to make sense of what’s in front of him. She keeps going, knowing that as soon as she sees him pass judgment on what she is, she’ll lose her nerve. “To look normal, I need to feed. And to feed, I invaded your dreams. That’s why you kept dreaming of me. At least at first…” She trails off, scrunching her eyes closed so she doesn’t lose her nerve.\n\n“We feed off of sex. That’s why I work as a camgirl. To find people to feed off of. Mostly through their dreams. If I do it in person… I might kill them. If we have sex, I might kill you. But there’s also a chance that I might not, since you survived….” She trails off, her pussy clenching at the memory of what he just did to her. “Still, it isn’t a sure thing.. I’m so sorry for misleading-”\n\nBecause her eyes are closed, she feels him drawing closer first. Then, the thumb that he presses to her lips, causing her nervous babbling to stop. She has no choice but to open her eyes then, only to be greeted by a sight that she never thought she’d see: another human being looking at her with affection shimmering in their eyes.\n\n“Don’t worry, babe. I’m not particularly attached to living. In fact, my preferred way to die is at the hands of a beautiful woman.”\n\nMikasa’s mouth falls open, unable to believe what she’s hearing. The wretched boy in front of her takes it as an opportunity to press his thumb against one of her fangs. “Shit, that’s sharp,” he says, and she can taste the arousal in his blood when it drips off of her tongue. Creature of the night that she is, she can’t stop herself from swallowing.\n\nEren watches it happen and, for a moment, so much desire and need fills his eyes, a perfect mirror to the abyss that exists inside of her. Making her believe him when he says, “I don’t care if you can hurt me. I like it rough.. ‘Sides, I’m pretty sure it’s gonna take more than a little pussy to kill me.”\n\nThen, before she can protest, to tell him that he should take her more seriously, he moves quickly, lifting her into the air like she weighs nothing. She yelps, but goes willingly when he reverses their positions and takes a seat in her chair with her on his lap, facing him like a child asking their daddy for candy. Making sure that she can feel the incessant hardness of his arousal, pressing against her wet and needy cunt. A tease that’s enough to make her dig her talons into his shoulders to hold him in place as she tries to find some relief.\n\n“Yes, that’s it. Just take what you need,” she hears him murmur as he leans in closer, almost like he means to kiss her. But how could he when he knows how sharp her teeth are now? How much more danger she poses to him, even if he’s pretending it doesn’t matter? And maybe this whole thing was a mistake, the kind that might haunt her for the rest of her days and-\n\nHe interrupts her by pressing his lips to hers before she can get any further, taking her by the back of her head so she can’t get away. It’s a consuming kiss, the kind that leaves her no choice but open to him. He isn’t careful with her sharp edges, true to his admission that he likes pain. She moans at the metallic edge of his blood, ringing through her teeth.\n\nThey kiss viciously, his fingers digging into the meat of her neck as if to impress upon her how close he wants to keep her. In her gut, she can feel the pull that she’s learned accompanies her draining someone. But instead of being met with the pliant resistance that she’s found in other men – shielding a modest amount of energy from her to drink from – she’s met by an overflowing of sensuality, almost as if every cell in his body is vibrating with the need to have her. Meeting the hungry beast inside her eagerly and generously, leaving her no choice to let go of her final strand of self control.\n\n“Fuck, you’re so wet, I can almost feel it through my clothes,” he murmurs against her mouth when they finally break apart to catch her breath. They’re close enough that the flushing of her skin at his words is immediately apparent to him. He moves his hand from the back of her neck to cradle her chin. “There you go, blushing again. Like you aren’t some vixen, sent from hell to torture me. I’ve practically rubbed my cock raw, thinking about you.”\n\nDespite how filthy his words are, there’s a sweetness about them. An earnestness. From the intensity of feeling in his eyes, she knows without a doubt that he’s telling the truth. She shifts her hips a little, just to feel the way his kick up in response, seeking out the hot, wet place between her legs. She regains the upperhand, leaning in close to his ear.\n\n“What do you think about?”\n\nMikasa trails kisses down the side of his neck. Making sure to let the points of her fangs graze his veins. She feels the arousal shivering through his body as he tries to find the words to answer her. His cock is so hard underneath her that it must hurt, especially when she’s not wearing anything to hide how badly she wants him. She likes the way the vibration of his vocal chords feel underneath her lips once he finally answers her.\n\n“Honestly? Fucking you in this chair.”\n\nShe tilts her head up at him, remembering all the dark corridors she’d found in his mind. The places where he’d let her into through his dreams. And she did her best not to pry, she knew it wasn’t right to. But in every corner of his mind, she found something new that fascinated her. There’s a surprising innocence to this request that cuts through to the very heart of her.\n\n“Really? How do you want me?”\n\nNow, it’s his turn to blush. “Uh, like this. So I can look at your pretty face.” He meets her eyes again and there’s no fear, even though he knows what she really is. There’s just anticipation, thick and dark and simmering like a summer night’s heat. It makes her want to be good for him, so she comes up on her knees. Her hands drop to the button and zipper of his jeans, undoing them with practiced ease. His cock practically springs out of his boxers, thick and veiny with a glistening bead of pre-cum at the tip that she wants to taste.\n\nBefore she can, Eren’s hauling her over so she’s hovering right above it. “Fuck, your pussy’s hot and wet I can feel it,” he grits out, his words starting to slur together. Already pussy-drunk and she hasn’t even let him fuck her yet. She lets her hips drop a little, so her clit’s kissing the head of his cock. A tease meant to torture him so he has no choice but to surge up and take her. However, she isn’t expecting her body to react in kind, a terrible aching tugging at her insides and getting worse with every millisecond that he isn’t inside her.\n\n“Please, Mikasa,” Eren says in a ragged voice and the final thread of her self control snaps. With a brutal sort of grace, she notches the head of his cock inside her before slamming her hips down. Even with how big he is, she’s so wet that it doesn’t hurt too much, even with how tightly her insides are hugging him. Denim rasps against her ass once he finds her end, filling her completely. For a few breaths, all she can do is let herself feel it.\n\nIf she is to kill him, this is one of the moments where this would be made clear. Some weakening of his spirit that would be apparent from his eyes, the coloring of his face. Or at least, that’s how it’d been in her previous experience. But there is only desire in his eyes, threatening to swallow her whole. His hands find their way to her hips, pressing firmly into the groove beneath her hipbone. Egging her on with his touch.\n\n“Holy fucking shit,” he says, his eyes fluttering closed for a moment. “You really do have pussy worth dying for, Mikasa,” he adds, once his eyes open. Then, with an assured rolling of his hips, he starts to thrust up into her in a building rhythm that’s easy and pleasurable for her to match.\n\n“You aren’t going to die,” she says, as much to herself as to him, and then she kisses him, deeply and openly. Letting herself explore his mouth, taking her time with it. All the while their bodies learn how to feel good together, slowly and intentionally at first. Searching out the edges of each other’s pleasure like explorers marking out newly discovered land on a map.\n\nOnce they’ve charted out this new territory, she can feel in herself, and him too, the knowledge of where they have been. The way they tore into each other in their dreams. And steadily, a new rhythm takes hold of her, brutal and fast. Making her less careful with her teeth as she mouths at his lips, smiling at the way he moans when he can taste his own blood in their kiss.\n\nIt must make him wilder, his hips bucking up hard into hers, his grip on her hips becoming even more punishing. She breaks away from him to catch her breath and is immediately enraptured by the red string of spit that connects their mouths.\n\nReminding her of the vicious sort of lovemaking the thrall of his mind had pulled her into, all the ways that he’d found in dreams to make her his. And she finds herself searching for that same intensity in him now, letting her hands climb up his back. Teasing the tips of her talons along the smooth skin until he looks at her with knowing in his eyes that belongs to the nights they spent together before now, cocooned in the dark wonder of imagination.\n\n“I remember,” he says, when their eyes meet. “You want me to be meaner, don’t you?”Her pussy answers for her, getting impossibly tight and wet at his words, enough that her rhythm stutters. “Oh fuck, that really is what you want, isn’t it?”\n\nAll she needs is to give him a little nod and then, he’s ramming himself inside her over and over again. Harder, faster, and deeper, finding new secret places inside her, the kind that make her keen with pain and pleasure simultaneously. Her talons catch in his skin and she feels his skin jump underneath his fingers in a wince. But before she can pull them away, Eren fixes her with a heart-stopping, too-much look in his eyes.\n\n“Make me bleed.”\n\nShe smiles, a real one. The kind that shows all her teeth, even the scariest ones. And she can feel his cock swelling inside her, like everything about her that makes her dangerous is to him an aphrodisiac. When she draws her hands down, he groans at the sharp bite of her nails before rewarding her with a brutal volley of thrusts that leaves her no choice but to come. The totaling kind of orgasm that leaves her no choice but to scrunch her eyes closed and hold on as well as she can as ecstasy rips through her.\n\n“Holy fucking shit, Mikasa, Mikasa-”\n\n“Eren,” she cries out.\n\nAt the sound of his name in her mouth, his cock finds a new, tender spot inside her – deep where no one else has ever thought to look – and marks it with his cum and the incessant way he fucks it inside her. Leaving Mikasa no choice but to come again and again until she falls against his chest in a shivery, overcome mess. She’s thankful for it if only because it allows her to confirm that he’s still alive, the hammering of his heart against her cheek too loud to ignore.\n\nMikasa tilts her face so she can look up at him. The expression he’s wearing isn’t one she recognizes, but it makes her feel she’s in a dream. “Well, I hope you’re not too disappointed you’re still alive,” she says, once they’ve both cleaned themselves up a little and found their way to her bed. Finally, she’s divested him of his clothes. His soft cock, wet with both of them, rests against the curve of her ass. Still, she can feel it slowly hardening as her back settles against his chest. That, and the strange clutching sensation in her chest, makes her believe this is the sort of dream that has a good ending."
