Because of early intervention, original Spanish Colonial and Mexican-era adobe structures still exist, providing a window to the City’s past. With a spectacular setting nestled between the mountains and the sea, bathed in a mild climate, the City has become a world-class tourist destination.",

        "text": "1786 Presidio horses were pastured to the north of the Chumash village of Mescaltitan, located on an island in Goleta slough (no longer extant), and were guarded by nine privates and one corporal (Whitehead 1996:130). 1786 Goycoechea collected a supply of 20,000 adobe bricks in May for construction at the Santa Barbara Presidio. They were used to erect walls for the soldiers' barracks and sergeant's quarters. By September, the guardhouse, sergeant's quarters and five soldiers' residences were covered with tile (Whitehead 1996:131). 1786 The first marriage was performed at the Presidio for Joseph Calisto and Juana Vitala Feliz on December 3 (Whitehead 1996:133). 1786 Father Fermín de Lasuén founded Mission Santa Barbara on December 4, and officially recognized on December 14. No construction immediately occurred at the Mission site due to heavy, continuous rains. Mission fathers lived at the nearby presidio during this period. Temporary buildings of palisade were constructed, including a chapel, living quarters for missionaries, kitchen, and storerooms. Agricultural implements at the Mission included eight crowbars, 15 pickaxes, six ploughshares, 12 plough points, five machetes, 12 sickles, 12 large heavy knives, eight ploughs, and one wooden cart. (Engelhardt 1923:54; Geiger 1965) 1787 Construction at the Mission began early in the year. The earliest buildings were believed to form a single wing of the west side of the Mission quadrangle. All structures were built of poles and roofed with grass (a technique known as jacal), with the exception of the four rooms of unidentified function. Esperanza María was the first Chumash baptized, in the Mission's temporary log chapel. The Mission's first neophyte marriages and burials also occurred. Franciscan missionaries reported the production of 156 fanegas (equivalent to 265 bushels) of wheat, barley, corn, beans, peas, and horsebeans. Regarding livestock, missionaries reported 24 cows, three bulls, 19 tame oxen, 34 calves, 27 sheep, 87 goats, nine pack and saddle mules, 20 horses, 11 mares, and one stallion. The chapel at Santa Barbara Presidio was completed. The Mission received its first shipment of cloth. (Geiger 1965, Bancroft 1966) 1787 The first marriage of a presidio soldier took place at the new Mission Santa Barbara on June 12. Hilario Gimenez, a member of the guard, took Indian neophyte Juana Maria as his wife (Whitehead 1996:133). 1787 As of November 3, the presidio staffing was one lieutenant, three sergeants, two corporals and fifty privates. They utilized 124 horses and 109 mules for transportation. The church, houses of the officers, chaplain's quarters and five soldiers' quarters were completed and in use at the presidio (Whitehead 1996:134). Two sides of the quadrangle had been completed, a third side had been started, and a fourth side had been laid out (Whitehead 1996:135). 1787 Mission La Purisima Concepcion was founded near present day Lompoc by Father Lasuen on December 8 (Writers' Project 1941:187). 1788 During the first six months nothing was built at Mission Santa Barbara this year except for a corral due to food shortages in the first half of the year. During the next six months, the first tiles at the Mission were made. The four rooms begun the previous year were roofed with tile, as was the monjerio, and the house for the single men, which became a granary. A new house (33 x 14 feet) was built of poles and roofed with tile, as was a room of adobe to serve as a kitchen. The church was extended with walls of half adobe and roofed with tiles. (Engelhardt 1923:58; O'Keefe 1895:10) 1788 The quadrangle walls at the presidio were completed to form the enclosure and the roofs of the structures inside were finished with tiles (Whitehead 1996:137). 1789 A second church (82 ½ x 16 ½ feet) was erected, this time of all adobe, and roofed with tile. The former thatch-and-poles chapel was removed. Also constructed was a larger granary (85 x 19 feet), and nearby a new monjerio (33 x 19 feet), two rooms of 14 x 12 feet, one to serve as a henhouse, the other a jail, all built of adobes and tile. A room for the storage of horse and mule gear (25 x 14 feet) was constructed of poles, and roofed in tile. Additionally, a formal cemetery was laid out at the Mission. Note: Engelhardt mistakenly referred to the second church as being 108 x 17 feet. (Engelhardt 1923:61; Geiger 1963:6-7; Geiger 1965:41; O'Keefe 1895:10-11) 1790 Several buildings were constructed this year, all of adobes and tiles, as all buildings were after this year. They consisted of two apartments for the padres (27 ½ x 16 ½ feet). Each apartment had a parlor (16 ½ feet long) and a bedroom. A long building (165 x 16 ½ feet) was constructed containing eight rooms: the refectory, kitchen, toilet, tool room, wood room, jail, flour room, and a room for the women. The building was roofed in tile, and each room provided with a door and window. In addition, a new granary was built (33 x 19 feet), and a place where the pozole (meat and vegetable stew) was made. Note: in Egenhoff (1952:154) the flour room is translated to mean a mill, and O'Keefe describes it as a meal room. Neither Engelhardt nor O'Keefe mention the construction of the pozolera. (Engelhardt 1923:60; O'Keefe 1895:11) 1790 Sixty-one officers and soldiers were serving at the presidio along with six other men. They were accompanied by their wives and children for a total of 230 people living at the site (Whitehead 1996:140). 1791 A carpenter was brought to Mission Santa Barbara to teach his trade to neophytes. (Engelhardt 1923). Four new adobe buildings were constructed this year. They included a soldier's barracks (27 ½ x 16 ½ feet), a storeroom for carpenter's tools, and two rooms for farm equipment and tools. Note: O'Keefe describes the room as a carpenter's shop. (Engelhardt 1923:62; O'Keefe 1895:11) 1792 Two large corrals were built of stone. One (247 ½ x 206 feet) was for cattle, the other (206 x 137 ½ feet) for sheep. Note: Engelhardt translated 75 varas as 208 ft. (Engelhardt 1923:62; O'Keefe 1895:11) 1793 A third church (124 x 25 feet) of adobe was begun, and an adjoining sacristy (25 x 14 feet). Both buildings were tiled and plastered. A brick and tile portico was added in front of the church. (Father Paterna, the Mission's founding Franciscan, died early in the year.) Note: Engelhardt describes the sacristy as 26 feet (Engelhardt 1923:62; O'Keefe 1895:11). 1793 British Naval Captain George Vancouver visited Santa Barbara November 10-18 as part of his exploration of the Pacific. He described an oil slick on the surface of the sea off the coast of Santa Barbara. He found the small town to be more civilized than any other of the Spanish coastal settlements he had visited. He remarked that most of the ceramic tableware used by those living at the presidio was made in England. (Wilbur 1954; Whitehead 1996:142; Writers' Project, 1941:188). His book describing his travels, Voyage of Discovery, was first published in 1798. (Geiger 1965) 1794 The third church was completed at Mission Santa Barbara and remained in use until an earthquake in 1812. Constructed this year were a granary (71 ½ x 19 feet) with whitewashed walls, a weaving room (49 ½ x 19 feet) with a patio (27 ½ x 49 ½ feet), and a sheep corral (170 ½ square feet) with an eight-foot-high wall. An adobe wall (124 x 44 feet) was constructed around the cemetery. The top of this wall was covered with tiles. Note: Engelhardt translated 7 varas as only 17 feet, and applied this figure to the width of the granary and weaving room. He described the corral as 172 feet square with a 9 feet wall. (Engelhardt 1923:62-63; Geiger 1963:6-7, 1965:33; O'Keefe 1895:12) 1795 Franciscans at Mission Santa Barbara requested assistance from the San Luis Obispo and Purísima Missions due to drought (Geiger 1965). The roof on 2 ½ sides of the tile-paved quadrangle were renovated. Roof beams of pine replaced the old beams of sycamore and poplar. A new addition (69 x 8 feet) was added to the missionaries' quarters, and contained two bedrooms and two studies. Note: Engelhardt described the width of the quarters as 9 feet. (Engelhardt 1923:63; O'Keefe 1895:12) 1796 The one thousandth baptism of Chumash Indians occurred at Mission Santa Barbara. Weaving rooms were established. Typhoid and pneumonia were reported at the missions. (Geiger 1965, Walker and Johnson 1992) Workers continued to replace roof beams with new ones of pine on the remainder of the quadrangle. A front corridor (124 x 8 feet) facing in the direction of the presidio was built of brick pillars supporting a tile roof to protect the wing's adobe walls from southeastern storms. A patio corridor (49 ½ x 8 feet) was established along the weaving rooms with an adobe room (16 ½ x 8 feet) at either end. This completed the first quadrangle. (Engelhardt 1923:63-54; Geiger 1963:88-89, 126-129, 1965:42; O'Keefe 1895:12-13) 1797 A second quadrangle, north of the first, was initiated with an entrance from the old Mission. Constructed were three granaries (69 feet long each), and an additional room (16 ½ feet long) that gave entry to two of the granaries. A smithy (25 x 16 ½ feet), chicken house (25 x 16 ½ feet), and a room for calves (27 ½ x 16 ½ feet) were also built. Note: Engelhardt describes the entrance to the granary as 29 feet (Engelhardt 1923:66; Geiger 1965:42; O'Keefe 1895:13). 1797 In April, presidio troops were being given daily drill in the handling of arms and was acting in a state of alert against an expected English invasion. France had declared war against Britain, Holland and Spain early in 1793, and had invaded Spain in 1794. In July 1795, Spain signed a peace treaty with France, and in August 1796, Spain allied itself with France against Britain. Spain's coonies were aware of the possibility of invasion by the English all during these years (Whitehead 1996:148). 1797 The presidio chapel was dedicated on December 12 (Whitehead 1996:149). 1798 Nineteen houses for the neophytes were constructed southwest of the Mission quadrangle as the beginning of the Indian village. Each apartment was 11 x 18 feet and contained a door and moveable window. They were whitewashed inside and out. A 5775 feet circumference, 8 feet high wall capped with tiles was built to enclose a kitchen garden, vineyard, and orchard. Note: Engelhardt describes each room as 12 ft. wide, and the wall as 8 ½ ft. high, and the circumference of the wall as 3300 ft. (equivalent to 1200 varas, as was reported by O'Keefe). The total population of Hispanics in the Santa Barbara area was 370. (Geiger 1965, Bancroft 1966; Engelhardt 1923:66-67; O'Keefe 1895:13) 1799 Another granary (124 x 18 ft.) was built. A 110 ft. square reservoir was planned. Note: Engelhardt mistakenly attributes some construction work of 1800 to 1799 (neophyte houses and corridor). At the Mission were 864 neophytes, 433 women and 431 men. The number of baptisms recorded at the Mission were 1,756, deaths 736, and 397 marriages. (Engelhardt 1923:67; O'Keefe 1895:14) 1800 A minor earthquake occurred resulting in little damage to the Mission. Thirty-one new neophyte houses were constructed in the village, all with doors and windows, mortared on the outside and whitewashed on the interior. Houses were built to form a street. Corridors of brick and mortar were constructed along three walls of the Mission quadrangle. Note: O'Keefe mistakenly reports the number of neophyte houses as 32. Father Estevan Tapis wrote a letter to Father Lasuén countering the charge from Captain Goycoechea that Mission Indians received insufficient food. The document contains important information on neophyte diet and Mission agriculture, and discusses conflicts with the Presidio regarding neophyte labor. A corporal was brought to the Mission to teach neophytes the trade of tanning. By this time, 60 neophytes were engaged in weaving. The Mission suffers only minimal damage during an earthquake. (Bancroft 1966, Engelhardt 1923:68, Geiger 1965; O'Keefe 1895:14) 1801 A diphtheria epidemic was reported in the missions. Thirty-one new neophyte houses were constructed in the village. An adobe house (58 x 16-½ ft.) was built, and divided into a bedroom, reception room, kitchen, and chicken house. O'Keefe described this house as for the use of the head gardener and his family, although his source for this is not given. (Egenhoff 1952:20;Walker and Johnson 1992) 1802 Thirty-one additional neophyte houses were built. The village was enclosed on three sides with an adobe wall 8 feet high. high. A building (55 x 16 ½ ft.) was built containing five tanks for tanning hides. Adjacent to the tannery was a majordomo's house (49 ½ x 16 ½ ft.) with a bedroom, reception room, and kitchen. A corridor was built along both the tannery and majordomo's house. In addition, five rooms (110 x 16 ½ ft.) were constructed for various purposes. (Engelhardt 1923:84-86; Geiger 1963:14, 1965:42; O'Keefe 1895:14) 1803 The two thousandth baptism occurred. The largest number of neophytes, 1,792, was recorded at the Mission during this year. The Mission's sheep herds were at their largest extent with 11,221 head. Forty-eight more neophyte houses were constructed (161 total in the village). In addition, a chapel (60 ½ x 25 ft.) dedicated to San Miguel was built at Cienguitas (or La Cienguita), a rancheria 2 leagues (approximately 6 miles) from the Mission. (Engelhardt 1923:86; O'Keefe 1895:15; Geiger 1965:42) 1804 The three thousandth baptism occurred. Reported at the Mission were 1,896 neophytes. Franciscans established San Marcos Rancho beyond the mountains as an expansion of the Mission's ranching activities. Mission Santa Inés was founded in part to take pressure off Santa Barbara's neophyte and livestock populations. Thirty-seven additional houses in the neophyte village were built. A large partially covered patio was constructed for various neophyte uses. Note: both O'Keefe and Engelhardt translated patio as a mud wall around a yard. (Engelhardt 1923:86; O'Keefe 1895:16; Geiger 1965) 1804 Mission Santa Ines was founded by Father Estevan Tapis on September 17 near present day Santa Ynez. 1805 Thirty-six more houses were constructed (234 total in the village), in addition to two large rooms for granaries and one for wood. Father Estevan Tapis wrote a letter to Governor Arillaga. The letter contained information on neophyte punishments and Franciscan ideas of freedom and duties. (Geiger 1965; Engelhardt 1923:87-88; O'Keefe 1895:17) 1806 A large stone reservoir was built 110 ft. square, and 7 ft. Deep under the direction of Father Ripoll. The \"Indian Dam\" was built across Mission Creek. These water collection devices were also constructed to serve the residents of the Santa Barbara Presidio. An earthquake occurred on March 24, causing extensive damage to the Presidio Chapel, but little damage at the Mission. A measles epidemic was reported at the missions. The presidial complement of soldiers increased to 66 men. (Engelhardt 1923:88; Geiger 1965:16, Walker and Johnson 1992, Bancroft 1970; O'Keefe 1895:18 1807 Eighteen additional houses were built in the neophyte village as the last additions (252 total). Four houses for soldiers were constructed, facing the church. A dam of rough stone and mortar was built across Mission (Pedregosa) Creek. The date of construction of the Rattlesnake Canyon Dam is unknown, but likely to be in 1807 or 1808. Also apparently constructed this year, but curiously not specified in the annual report, was the grist mill, upper reservoir, and long segments of aqueduct. (Engelhardt 1923:88; Geiger 1965:52-53; O'Keefe 1895:18) 1808 Hogs were introduced to the Mission. (Geiger 1965) The fountain and laundry were built in front of the Mission (for the benefit of humanity) and a house for pottery making. The annual report also notes unfinished work. (Engelhardt 1923:90; Geiger 1963:14-15, 1965:53; O'Keefe 1895:18) 1809 The Mission's cattle herds were at their largest extent with 5,200 head. (Geiger 1965) The priests' dwelling (facing towards the ocean) was enlarged with a wall of lime and stone and a flat roof meant to be walked upon. Engelhardt attributes the beginnings of this construction to 1808, and notes that it was not completed until 1811. (Engelhardt 1923:90; O'Keefe 1895:18) 1810 Mexico revolted against Spain for its independence beginning on September 16. (Geiger 1965) The Santa Barbara Mission priests only note that work started in the previous year was continued. (Engelhardt 1923:90; O'Keefe 1895:18) 1811 Ships from Mexico no longer brought goods to California, resulting in unpaid soldiers' wages. The Santa Barbara Presidio required the Mission to supply food and clothing. (Geiger 1965) The enlargement of the priests' quarters was finished, including a corridor of stone arches. Work began on the completion of the church's facade. (Engelhardt 1923:90; Geiger 1963:8-9, 88-91; O'Keefe 1895:18). An earthquake occurred on December 8 (Writers' Project 1941:188). 1812 A major earthquake struck on December 21, causing severe damage to the Santa Barbara Mission buildings, including the third church and its not-yet-completed façade and the Presidio compound. The priests recommended that the church be entirely replaced. A temporary church and a temporary chapel was built at their respective locations the following year (Geiger 1965:43; Engelhardt 1923:90-91; O'Keefe 1895:19). The same earthquake also destroyed Mission La Purisima (Writers' Project 1941:188). 1813 Father Ramón Olbés responded to a questionnaire sent to Mission Santa Barbara by a government official. This questionnaire, sent the previous year, solicited information on the natives of California and the progress of the missions. Missionary answers to questions on native education, Spanish speaking abilities, feelings toward the Spanish, virtues and vices, religion, social status, marriages, curing techniques, food sources, burial customs, and general conditions within the mission have great potential for describing the native condition and ideology. At the end of this year, the Mission counted 2,300 horses, the highest number of these herds. (Geiger and Meighan 1976, Geiger 1965). The priests reported only that all was the same as in previous years. O'Keefe states that the ruins of the old Church were taken down in this and the next year. In contrast, Engelhardt reports that the priests were baptizing in a temporary palisade chapel in the beginning of the year, and in the Church during the end of the year. He assumes that repairs were made to the old Church, and further asserts that the Fourth Church was built literally around the walls of the Third. Geiger confirms this assertion and further notes that portions of the Third Church were discovered during the restoration of 1952. (Engelhardt 1923:101; Geiger 1963:12-13; 1965:43; O'Keefe 1895:19) 1814 Extensive repairs were made to the Mission Santa Barbara neophyte village, caused by earthquake and heavy rains. (Geiger 1965:44) 1815 Additional repairs to structures continued. O'Keefe and Geiger note that construction of the new sandstone church (the fourth and present church) began in this year. This structure was built around the third adobe church. Father Ripoll, generally credited with the design of the fourth Church, was assigned to the Mission in this year. (Geiger 1965:43-44; O'Keefe 1895:19) 1815 Jose De La Guerra was appointed Comandante of Santa Barbara Presidio. 1816 The report prepared by the priests of Mission Santa Barbara for this year was the same as the last -- repairs to the Mission structures caused by the December, 1812 earthquake continued. 1817 Construction resumed this year. Twenty harnesses were added, along with tools for carpentry. A wing of adobe was built, containing a granary, room for calves, and room for tools and field implements. The roof of the front wing facing the presidio was remodeled from a flat to a gable roof. (Engelhardt 1923:102; Geiger 1965:44; O'Keefe 1895:19) 1818 Hippolyte Bouchard invaded Alta California. Some of Mission Santa Barbara's neophytes and goods were moved inland to Mission Santa Inés, causing disruption. Father Ripoll armed the neophytes with bows and arrows and knives. Thirty neophyte horsemen were armed with lances. No harm was caused at the Mission due to a truce between Bouchard and Captain José de la Guerra. Santa Barbara's first Yankee settler, Joseph Chapman, was captured from Bouchard, where he had been impressed into service. He later became known for the construction of a fulling mill at Santa Inés, among other accomplishments. (Geiger 1965, Engelhardt 1923). The priests report only that everything was as the year before, and repair and construction work continued. O'Keefe notes that construction work on the fourth church building was ongoing. (O'Keefe 1895:19) 1819 The report was the same as the previous year's. 1820 The fourth church was completed and dedicated on September 10 in the presence of the Mexican Governor of Alta California, ____ Sola. The priests described the new church facade as dressed stone and mortar, with walls of sold sandstone 5 ½ ft. thick, with stone buttresses. A massive two-story bell tower was also constructed. They also described the church interior with its plastered ceilings, paintings, and painted marble columns and altars. A statue of Saint Barbara was placed in the niche of the facade, and statues of Faith, Hope, and Charity were placed at the apex of the triangular facade. The floor of the church was described as burnished bitumen. O'Keefe describes the new church dimensions as 60 varas (165 ft.) long by 14 varas (38 ½ ft.) wide, with a height of 10 varas (27 ½ ft.) (Engelhardt 1923:111-113; Geiger 1963:6-13 1965:43; O'Keefe 1895:19-20) 1821 The Treaty of Córdova, announcing Mexico's independence from Spain, was signed. The College of San Fernando took an oath of allegiance to the new government. At Santa Barbara, the Spanish flag was lowered. The Franciscans reported a harvest at Mission Santa Barbara of 12,820 bushels of crops, including wheat, barley, corn, and vegetables. No new buildings were added to the Mission compound as it was considered to be complete (Geiger 1965:49) 1822- 1823 A measles epidemic was reported at the missions. (Walker and Johnson 1992) 1823 Mexico adopted a republican form of government. (Geiger 1965) 1824 Both Alta and Baja California constituted a territory under Mexican government rule. The Chumash neophytes revolted against the priests and soldiers in February. Initially set off by the ill treatment of a Mission La Purísima neophyte, and fostered by neophyte unhappiness with the mission system and military presence, the revolt quickly spread to other missions. Neophytes at Mission Santa Barbara armed themselves. During a skirmish with the Presidio guards, neophytes wounded several soldiers. Five neophytes died in the fray. Neophytes broke into the Mission's storeroom and carried away money and clothes. The vast majority of neophytes then abandoned the Mission, heading up Mission Canyon. Soldiers killed more neophytes in days following and sacked the neophyte village. A truce eventually stopped the revolt and soldiers were sent out to capture neophyte fugitives. Most neophytes returned to the Mission by June. Father Ripoll defended the Indians' actions, indirectly blaming the military. In Mission registers were listed 923 neophytes, 430 females and 532 males, a decrease of 43 neophytes from the previous year. (Geiger 1965, Engelhardt 1923, Bancroft 1970) 1825 Father Ripoll left Mission Santa Barbara rather than take an oath of allegiance to the new government. (Geiger 1965) 1826 In December the first Ayuntamiento was ordered by Governor Echeandia which changed the Santa Barbara Presidio from military to civil government (Writers' Project 1941:188). 1827 Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly visited California, including Santa Barbara (Geiger 1965). Note: Duhaut-Cilly's writings on California are much cited. They are quoted in detail in Engelhardt's (1923), Egenhoff's (1952), and Webb's (1952) publications. 1827- 1828 Additional outbreaks of measles epidemics were reported. (Walker and Johnson 1992) 1828 American settler Daniel Hill constructed an adobe house with the first wooden floor in Santa Barbara. Now known as the Carrillo Adobe, the residence was named for one of California's most distinguished families (Writers' Project 1941:189). 1829 The first Mexican school was established in Santa Barbara (Writers' Project 1941:189). 1829- 1830 Alfred Robinson twice visited Santa Barbara. His later writings on this visit include information on neophyte life and the state of the Mission (Robinson 1891). He continued to visit the area and later married a daughter of the de la Guerra family. (Geiger 1965) 1831 Construction of a second tower was begun at Mission Santa Barbara (Geiger 1965:49). 1832 An unidentified epidemic, possibly influenza, swept through the missions. (Walker and Johnson 1992) 1833 Completion of the second tower of Mission Church at Santa Barbara. The Mexican National Congress passed the Law of Secularization declaring the mission no longer Church property. (Geiger 1965) 1856 A lighthouse was erected on July 3 as an aid to ships passing through the Santa Barbara Channel. The light was built about two miles north of the city at the present site of Shoreline Park.
