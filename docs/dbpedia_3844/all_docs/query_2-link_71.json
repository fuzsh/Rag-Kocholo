        "text": "The City of Lompoc is excited to announce that it is conducting a technical update to the City of Lompoc 2030 General Plan and preparing the 6th Cycle Update to the Housing Element. This technical update includes updating the existing Safety and Circulation Element, including the development of a new Environmental Justice Element (as required by State Law). The City initiated this update to refine the existing goals and policies of these Elements to address changes to State law and consider changing community needs and opportunities. This effort will enable the City to implement best practices to ensure the goals and policies in the 2030 General Plan meet the needs of the community now, and in the future.\n\nThe success of this planning effort will depend in part on input from the community to fully identify the cityâ€™s needs and expectations for this update. There will be many opportunities to participate in this update process as the project progresses. This webpage will be your primary source for information related to the project, including project documents, scheduling, news on upcoming meetings, and public outreach opportunities.\n\nRevised 2023-2031 Housing Element Available Now!\n\nThe City of Lompoc presented its Adopted Housing Element to the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for 60-day review on November 21, 2023. On January 29, 2024, the City received a comment letter from HCD indicating the remaining revisions needed to achieve certification and full compliance with State law.\n\nThrough spring and early summer 2024, the City worked with HCD to address each remaining comment. During this process the City received informal comments from HCD in writing in April, and again in May, as well as additional comments via Zoom conference call in June.\n\nThe Revised Adopted Housing Element, showing changes based on these reviews, is now available for public review and comment. Please use the buttons below to download the Revised Adopted Housing Element and HCD comments.\n\n2023-2031 Housing Element Adopted!\n\nThe City of Lompoc presented its Draft Housing Element to the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for initial 90-day review on May 11, 2023.

The Public Hearing Draft Housing Element was submitted to the Planning Commission on October 25, 2023 and to the City Council on November 21, 2023, at which time the Council adopted the Housing Element.\n\nNext Steps: The City must submit the Adopted Housing Element to HCD for a follow-up 60-day review.\n\nPlease use the button below to download the Adopted Housing Element."
