FLOWER FIELDS

If you visit Lompoc anytime from spring through fall you may be lucky enough to see the spectacular sights of the flower fields. Lompoc Valley is home to commercial flower growers with fields of stunning blooms that stretch for acres. The flower fields rotate every year, so when I first moved to Lompoc, I found it difficult to find them. I would head out to look for the delphinium and instead find lavender at a different location. So, my advice is to have a list of many different locations and enjoy the beautiful drive looking for them. Some can be spotted west of Old Town Lompoc, along Central Avenue, from Floradale Ave. to Union Sugar Ave.

Please remember that these flowers are people's livelihoods. Do not pick them. Be respectful and do not walk through them, allow children or pets to play in them.

MURALS

As well as flowers, Lompoc is famous for its beautiful murals. Visitors from all over come to see the murals which depict Lompoc’s heritage, flower industry, historic sights and more. If you visit Lompoc's historic old town, you will find 40 murals spread over street corners, alleyways and on the sides of buildings. When we first moved here, we drove through the old town, it became a game to spot a new mural. My son was very excited to see the murals dedicated to space and dinosaurs. So. one day he dressed up in some of his favorite costumes and we played around with the many murals!

As you stroll through the streets, each mural tells a story, depicting the community's history, culture, and natural beauty. The mural tour is a testament to Lompoc's commitment to public art, creating a kaleidoscope of colors that adds to the city's unique character.
