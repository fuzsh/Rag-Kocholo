Welcome

The U.S. District Court of Oregon Historical Society was created in 1984, following a picnic at the home of Hon. James M. Burns near the banks of the Willamette River.

Our purpose is to preserve the unique history of the U.S. District Court of Oregon, established in 1859 with Matthew P. Deady serving as Oregonâ€™s first district judge.

We accomplish our mission through events such as our famous cases series, our annual dinner honoring a Lifetime Service Award recipient, and through our preservation efforts, particularly our oral history archives.

For more information about our history, see About Us.
