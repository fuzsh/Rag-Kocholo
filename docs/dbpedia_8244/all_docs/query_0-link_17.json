        "text": "Courts should look like the people they represent. While judges who sit on the federal bench are overwhelmingly white and male, previous administrations have put an emphasis on increasing representation for both women and people of color. Under the Trump administration, this progress stalled. The Biden administration has the opportunity to reverse this trend by nominating more diverse people to the federal bench.\n\nThis page shares current statistics on all active Article III judges. These graphs do not account for judges who have taken senior status (the Federal Judicial Center explains that senior status “enables judges to continue hearing cases with a reduced workload in lieu of retiring entirely”). Article III judges make up the U.S. Supreme Court, circuit courts, district courts, and the U.S. Court of International Trade. The page also compares the Article III judges confirmed under the the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations.\n\nFor more data regarding the LGBTQ+ diversity on our federal courts, we encourage you to visit the LGBTQ+ Bar’s Article III Judges webpage.\n\nACS compiled these statistics from data made available by the Federal Judicial Center. We update the graphics continually.\n\nGender and Racial/Ethnic Breakdown of Active Federal Judges Confirmed Under Presidents Biden,\n\nTrump, and Obama\n\nDuring the Obama administration, there were 329 confirmed Article III judges: 2 justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, 55 circuit court judges, 268 district court judges, and 4 judges to the U.S. Court of International Trade.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, there were 234 confirmed Article III judges: 3 justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, 54 circuit court judges, 174 district court judges, and 3 judges to the U.S. Court of International Trade. Of the judges nominated by President Trump, most were white and male.\n\nSo far under the Biden administration, there have been 205 confirmed Article III judges: 1 justice to the U.S. Supreme Court, 43 circuit court judges, 159 district court judges, and 2 judge to the U.S. Court of International Trade.\n\nThe charts below show the difference in the diversity of lifetime judges confirmed during the Biden, Trump, and Obama administrations."
