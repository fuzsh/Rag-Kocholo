Simon, the head of litigation for the Portland office of the Perkins Coie law firm.\n\n\"These individuals have demonstrated a commitment to justice throughout their careers,\" said President Obama. \"I am confident they will serve the American people with distinction from the United States District Court.\"\n\nThe White House provided the following bios on the two nominees from Oregon:\n\nJudge Marco A. Hernandez\n\nis a Circuit Court judge in Washington County, Oregon, where he has served on the bench for 15 years. He was presiding judge of the Circuit Court from 2002 to 2005. Judge Hernandez began his legal career in 1986 with Oregon Legal Services, where he worked on federal civil cases on behalf of farm workers. From 1989 to 1994, he served as a Deputy District Attorney in Washington County. Judge Hernandez received his J.D. in 1986 from the University of Washington School of Law and his B.A. (honors) in 1983 from Western Oregon State College.\n\nMichael H. Simon\n\nis a partner in the law firm of Perkins Coie LLP, where he specializes in business litigation in both state and federal court and is head of litigation for the firm's Portland office. Since becoming a partner in 1990, he has handled several high-profile First Amendment cases on a pro bono basis. Prior to joining Perkins Coie in 1986, Mr. Simon served as a trial attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, in Washington, D.C., where he handled both civil and criminal antitrust matters.
