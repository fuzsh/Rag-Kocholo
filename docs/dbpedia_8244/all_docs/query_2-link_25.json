        "text": "Beth Bloom has served as a United States District Judge in the Southern District of Florida since 2014. She was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate (95-0) on June 24, 2014 (her birthday). Before her appointment to the federal bench, she served on the Florida state court bench in Miami-Dade County for nearly 20 years. She was appointed by former Governor Charlie Crist to the Circuit Court in 2010 after serving 15 years as a County Court Judge. She has served in the Circuit Court’s criminal and civil divisions and all divisions of the County Court, serving as the Associate Administrative Judge.\n\nJudge Bloom received her Bachelor of Science degree in public relations from the University of Florida in 1984 and her Juris Doctor degree (cum laude) from the University of Miami School of Law. She practiced commercial litigation with the law firm of Floyd Pearson Richman Greer Weil Zack & Brumbaugh from 1988-1994 and served as a Traffic Court Magistrate from 1993-1994 before her election to the state court bench. Judge Bloom currently serves as a member of the Judiciary Division Board of the Federal Bar Association and is a Board Member of the South Florida Chapter of the Federal Bar Association. In 2015, she established and coordinates the Southern District of Florida’s annual Summer Intern Ethics and Orientation Program and oversees its annual Law Day and Constitution Day Programs. She is the co-creator of the Civil Discourse & Difficult Decisions Program, now a national initiative, presented to high school students in the federal court and remotely in the classrooms.\n\nJudge Bloom is a frequent lecturer for the Florida Bar, local bar associations and FBA chapters. She has presented at the 2018 New Judges College and the 2017 District Judges Conference. She served on the faculty of the Florida Judicial College for 19 years, teaching newly elected and appointed judges. She has served on the faculty of the National Judicial College, the College of Advanced Judicial Studies, the Florida Conference of County Court Judges and an adjunct faculty member of the Litigation Skills Program at the University of Miami School of Law.\n\nWhile serving as a state court judge, Judge Bloom was elected as the first woman president of the Florida Conference of County Court Judges, a member of the Executive Committee of the Florida Conference of Circuit Court Judges and was a founding member of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Historical Society. She coordinated the University of Miami School of Law’s Judicial Internship Program for 17 years. In Miami- Dade County, she created the “Lawyers Join Hands for Students” Program, the DUI In-Jail Treatment Program, the Smoking Tobacco Offender Program (S.T.O.P.), the “It’s Your Life” Skills Program for foster youth aging out of the foster care system, and the “I’m Ready” Program for youthful offenders sentenced in adult criminal court. She coordinated the Artist in Residence Program with artist Romero Britto and students from Miami-Dade’s Visual and Performing Arts Academies and implemented the Eleventh Circuit’s Centennial Celebration’s county-wide poster, essay and speech contests with the Miami-Dade County schools. She led the effort to establish “Friends of Caleb,” and spearheaded the creation and construction of a now permanent mural commemorating Joseph Caleb. She is the co-founder of the Children’s Craniofacial Association at Miami Children’s Hospital and Oliver’s Fund at the University of Miami’s Debbie School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing."
