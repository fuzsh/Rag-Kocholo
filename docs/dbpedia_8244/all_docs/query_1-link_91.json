        "text": "Alert Type info\n\nALERT: Important Reminders Regarding the DACA Renewal Process\n\nWe continue to adjudicate the majority of DACA renewal requests within 120 days and make every effort to efficiently process these requests as we receive them. USCIS Historical Data shows the median processing time for DACA renewals and associated Employment Authorization Documents in fiscal year 2023 was 1 month, and less than 2 months for the first quarter of FY 2024.\n\nAs USCIS has long recommended, we strongly encourage DACA recipients to submit your DACA renewal request to us between 120 and 150 days (4 to 5 months) before the expiration date located on your current Form I-797 DACA approval notice. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Please note that filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision.\n\nAlert Type info\n\nALERT: Court decisions regarding DACA.\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the DACA Final Rule unlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021 injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” See the Memorandum and Order (PDF, 1.35 MB) and Supplemental Order of Injunction (PDF, 72.53 KB).\n\nAccordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated. In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, as it has since October 31, 2022. We will also continue to accept initial DACA requests, but in accordance with the District Court’s order, we will not process initial DACA requests.\n\nCurrent valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal.\n\nPlease see the DACA Litigation Information Page for important updates and information related to court rulings on the DACA policy.\n\nThis page provides information on requesting Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). You may request DACA for the first time or renew your existing period of DACA if it is expiring. Please note: While a July 16, 2021, injunction (PDF, 401.59 KB) from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and on Oct. 14, 2022 was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect, DHS is prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule.\n\nFile Online\n\nWhat Is DACA\n\nOn June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal. They are also eligible to request work authorization. Deferred action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not provide lawful status.\n\nOn Aug. 30, 2022, DHS published the DACA Final Rule, with the intent to preserve and fortify the DACA policy. This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance set forth in the 2012 Memorandum issued by Secretary Napolitano.\n\nRequest DACA for the First Time\n\nThe following information explains the guidelines for requesting DACA for the first time. Please note: While a July 16, 2021, injunction (PDF, 401.59 KB) from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and on Oct. 14, 2022 was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect, DHS is prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule.

The correct, most current edition of every USCIS form is always available to download for free on our website.\n\nIf you complete the forms by hand, use black ink only. Do NOT use highlighters or red ink on your forms. These could make your materials unreadable when scanned.\n\nIf you must make changes on a form, we recommend that you begin with a new form, rather than trying to white out information. This can lead to scanning errors.\n\nEnsure that you provide all required supporting documentation and evidence.\n\nBe sure to sign all of your forms.\n\nFiling Your Forms\n\nWe will reject your request if you fail to submit Forms I-821D, I-765, I-765WS, and the correct fees.\n\nOrganize and label your evidence by the DACA guideline that it meets.\n\nBe sure that you mail all pages of the forms.\n\nMail the forms to the correct USCIS Lockbox.\n\nIf you have questions, call the USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283; do NOT visit a USCIS field office.\n\nMail your forms to the appropriate USCIS Lockbox.\n\nSee the mailing instructions for Form I-821D. Include the required forms, fees and supporting documentation with your filing. Remember to carefully follow instructions and fully complete your forms. We will not accept incomplete forms or forms without proper fee. We will mail you a receipt after accepting your request. You may also choose to receive an email and/or text message notifying you that your form has been accepted by completing a Form G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance.\n\nUPDATE: Create a USCIS online account for DACA requests.\n\nAnyone who submits a DACA request can create a USCIS online account to track and manage their case online. If you submit a DACA request, you will receive a USCIS Account Acceptance Notice in the mail with instructions on how to create a USCIS online account.\n\nHaving a USCIS online account allows you to:\n\nCheck the status of your case;\n\nReceive notifications and case updates; and\n\nManage your contact information, including updating your address.\n\nIf you are an attorney or accredited representative, creating a USCIS online account will allow you to manage all of your clients’ DACA requests in one place. We will continue processing your DACA request even if you choose not to access your USCIS online account. You will continue to receive notifications and updates about your case by mail through the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nNote for Attorneys and Accredited Representatives: You should have only 1 USCIS online representative account. When you receive an Account Acceptance Notice for a paper form filed at a USCIS Lockbox on behalf of your client, please ensure that you enter the same personal information that you provided on the Form G-28 submitted with your client’s original application, petition or request. If the information you use to access your online representative account does not match the information you provided on the Form G-28, you may be unable to access your client’s case.\n\nVisit an Application Support Center (ASC) for biometric services.\n\nAfter USCIS receives your complete request with fees, we will send you a notice scheduling you to visit an ASC to for biometric services. If you fail to attend your ASC appointment, we may deny your DACA request. Children under 14 in removal proceedings, with a final removal order, or with a voluntary departure order, and who are not in immigration detention, will appear at the ASC for photographs only.You can check the status of your case on Case Status Online or by logging into your USCIS online account.\n\nFee Exemptions\n\nThere are very limited fee exemptions available. Your request for a fee exemption must be filed and favorably adjudicated before you file your DACA request without a fee. In order to be considered for a fee exemption, you must submit a letter and supporting documentation to USCIS demonstrating that you meet 1 of the following conditions:\n\nYou cannot care for yourself because you suffer from a serious, chronic disability and your income is less than 150 percent of the U.S. poverty level;\n\nYou have, at the time of the request, accumulated $10,000 or more in debt in the past 12 months as a result of unreimbursed medical expenses for yourself or an immediate family member, and your income is less than 150 percent of the U.S. poverty level; or\n\nYou are under 18 years of age, your income is less than 150 percent of the U.S. poverty level, and you are:\n\nHomeless;\n\nIn foster care; or\n\nOtherwise lacking any parental or other familial support.\n\nSubmit the following types of evidence:\n\nAffidavits from community-based or religious organizations to establish a requestor’s homelessness or lack of parental or other familial financial support.\n\nCopies of tax returns, bank statement, pay stubs, or other reliable evidence of income level.\n\nAn affidavit from the applicant or a responsible third party attesting that the applicant does not file tax returns, has no bank accounts, and/or has no income to prove income level.\n\nCopies of medical records, insurance records, bank statements, or other reliable evidence of unreimbursed medical expenses of at least $10,000.\n\nWe will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE) if we have questions about the evidence you submitted.\n\nYou can find additional information on our Fee Exemption Guidance Web page.\n\nNote: There are no fee waivers available for DACA requests and employment authorization applications connected to DACA.\n\nIf USCIS Grants DACA and Employment Authorization in Your Case\n\nIf USCIS grants DACA and employment authorization in your case, you will receive a written notice of that decision. An Employment Authorization Document will arrive separately in the mail.\n\nIn general, only noncitizens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number. If USCIS grants DACA, you can find additional information about Social Security Number and Card for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (PDF) on the Social Security Administration website.\n\nIf USCIS Does Not Grant DACA in Your Case\n\nIf USCIS denies your request for DACA, you cannot file an administrative appeal or a motion to reopen or reconsider. See 8 CFR 23.23(c)(3). USCIS will not review its discretionary determination to deny your request for DACA.\n\nUnder 8 CFR 236.23(c)(2), USCIS will not issue a Notice to Appear or refer a requestor’s case to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for possible enforcement action based on the denial of your DACA request unless we determine that your case involves denial for fraud, a threat to national security, or public safety concerns. For more information on notices to appear, visit uscis.gov/NTA.\n\nAdministrative Errors\n\nYou may request a review using the Service Request Management Tool process if you met all of the DACA guidelines and you believe USCIS denied your request because of an administrative error.\n\nExamples:\n\nUSCIS believes you abandoned your case by not responding to a request for evidence (RFE), and you believe you did respond within the prescribed time; or\n\nUSCIS mailed the RFE to the wrong address, even though you had submitted a Form AR-11, Change of Address, or changed your address online at uscis.gov before we issued the RFE.\n\nYou can find a full list of possible errors in our Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nTo make a service request, you must call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283. For people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833. A USCIS representative will then forward your request to the proper USCIS office. Your service request will be reviewed for accuracy and USCIS will send you a letter informing you of its decision.\n\nThe USCIS Contact Center is open Monday – Friday from 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nTravel Information\n\nCertain travel outside the United States may affect the continuous residence guideline. Traveling outside the United States before Aug. 15, 2012, will not interrupt your continuous residence if the travel was brief, casual, and innocent. If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before we make a decision on your request for DACA, you will not be considered for DACA.\n\nThe following chart explains whether your travel will affect your continuous residence.\n\nTravel DatesType of TravelDoes it Affect Continuous ResidenceOn or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012\n\nBrief,\n\nCasual, and\n\nInnocent\n\nNo\n\nFor an extended time\n\nBecause of an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal\n\nTo participate in criminal activity\n\nYesOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before you have requested DACA\n\nAny\n\nYes. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case and you cannot travel until you receive advance parole.On or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after you have requested DACA\n\nAny\n\nYes. You cannot travel while your request is under review. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case.\n\nIn addition, if you have previously been ordered deported and removed and you depart the United States without taking additional steps to address your removal proceedings, your departure will likely result in your being considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.\n\nOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after receiving DACA\n\nAny\n\nIt depends. If you travel after receiving advance parole, the travel will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, if you engage in unauthorized travel, the travel may interrupt your continuous residence.\n\nOnce USCIS has approved your request for DACA, you may file Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States. If you travel outside the United States without first receiving advance parole and then enter the United States without inspection, USCIS may terminate your DACA after issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond. DACA recipients who depart the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document run a significant risk of being unable to reenter the United States; obtaining an advance parole document prior to departure is strongly encouraged to reduce the risk of being unable to return and resume DACA.\n\nFor detailed information see the Travel section of the Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nNational Security and Public Safety Guidelines\n\nYou will not be considered for DACA if you have been convicted of:\n\nA felony offense;\n\nA significant misdemeanor offense (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)); or\n\n3 or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct.\n\nOr\n\nYou are otherwise deemed to pose a threat to national security or public safety.\n\nWhat is the difference between a “significant misdemeanor” (a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)), a “non-significant misdemeanor” (other misdemeanor), and a “felony”?\n\nFelonySignificant Misdemeanor (a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))Non-significant Misdemeanor (an “other misdemeanor” referenced at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))\n\nA felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year.\n\nA single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.\n\nA significant misdemeanor (that is, a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) and:\n\nRegardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; or,\n\nIf not an offense listed above, is an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a suspended sentence.\n\nA single conviction for a misdemeanor offense as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.\n\nA crime is considered a non-significant misdemeanor (referred to as “other misdemeanor” at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) and:\n\nIs not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; and\n\nIs an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less.\n\nThree or more convictions of “other misdemeanors” not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are disqualifying for purposes of DACA.\n\nA minor traffic offense is not considered a misdemeanor for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) and is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. DHS considers such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine if a requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. However, driving under the influence is a disqualifying misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) regardless of the sentence imposed. You can find detailed information in the Criminal Convictions section of the Frequent Asked Questions.\n\nDon’t Be a Victim of Immigration Scams\n\nDishonest practitioners may promise to provide you with faster services if you pay them a fee. These people are trying to scam you and take your money. Visit our Avoid Scams page to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams.\n\nMake sure you seek information about DACA from official government sources such as USCIS or the Department of Homeland Security. If you are seeking legal advice, visit our Find Legal Services page to learn how to choose a licensed attorney or accredited representative.\n\nRemember you can download all USCIS forms for free at www.uscis.gov/forms.\n\nCombatting Fraud\n\nUSCIS is committed to safeguarding the integrity of the immigration process. If you knowingly and willfully provide materially false information on Form I-821D, you will be committing a federal felony punishable by a fine, or imprisonment up to 5 years, or both, under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. In addition, you may be placed into removal proceedings, face severe penalties provided by law, and be subject to criminal prosecution."
