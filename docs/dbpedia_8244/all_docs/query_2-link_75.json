        "text": "President Barack Obama says he will nominate Vermont Supreme Court Associate Justice Geoffrey W. Crawford to serve on the U.S. District Court in Vermont.\n\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., as Vermont’s senior senator, had announced in March that he would recommend Crawford fill the upcoming vacancy created by the June retirement of Judge William K. Sessions III.\n\n“I am proud to nominate Justice Crawford to serve on the United States District Court bench,” President Obama said in a statement Monday. “Justice Crawford has a long and distinguished record of service, and I am confident he will serve on the federal bench with distinction.”\n\nLeahy said he was pleased by the president’s move.\n\n“The President sees in Justice Crawford what I, the members of the merit commission, and all Vermonters have come to know about him,” Leahy said in a statement Monday afternoon.\n\n“He is a fine jurist in the finest Vermont tradition, and he is committed to the highest standards of public service. I look forward soon to bringing Justice Crawford before the Judiciary Committee for a confirmation hearing,” Leahy said.\n\nThe Burlington Free Press reported March 24 that Leahy planned to submit Crawford’s name following an extensive search for a new federal judge.\n\nThe nomination of Crawford, whom Gov. Peter Shumlin appointed to state Supreme Court in October, would go next from Obama to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Leahy chairs. Leahy Spokesman David Carle said work will begin immediately on the nomination and Leahy “will push for confirmation by the end of this session.”\n\nThe full senate eventually would vote on the nomination.\n\nCrawford, 59, of Burlington had served as a state Superior Court judge for about 11 years before Shumlin elevated him to the high court.\n\nCrawford would join Chief U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss of Essex as Vermont’s two full-time federal judges. Crawford would preside primarily in Rutland. Reiss, who has been commuting to Rutland, plans to take over the fifth-floor courtroom in Burlington that Sessions has used.\n\nShumlin is expected to take no action on replacing Crawford on the Supreme Cout until there is a declared vacancy.\n\nContact Mike Donoghue at 660-1845 or mdonoghue@freepressmedia.com."
