        "text": "President Donald J. Trump on Thursday announced his nomination of Multnomah County Circuit Judge Karin J. Immergut to fill a federal district judge's vacancy in Oregon.\n\nImmergut, 57, has presided over more than 250 criminal and civil trials in state court since former Gov. Ted Kulongoski appointed her to a circuit judge's seat in 2009. That followed her six years as Oregon's U.S. attorney, appointed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nShe previously served two years as an assistant U.S. attorney in Oregon, assigned to the fraud unit and gun violence reduction initiative. Before that, she worked as a Multnomah County prosecutor, handling financial fraud, elder fraud and identity theft cases.\n\nShe took a leave of absence from her Multnomah County deputy district attorney's job to work in the Office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Her key grand jury interviews of Monica Lewinsky, which painstakingly unraveled the details of Lewinsky's sexual encounters with President Bill Clinton, ultimately helped determine that Clinton had lied under oath.\n\nShe began her legal career as a litigation associate at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. She also served as a federal prosecutor earlier in her career in California, where she was chief of the training section and deputy chief of the narcotics and money laundering section in California's central district.\n\nImmergut earned her bachelor's degree from Amherst College and her law degree from the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nImmergut was one of seven nominees announced Thursday for federal district judge's seats, Trump's 15th wave of judicial nominees as president. If confirmed, she'd fill the seat vacated by U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown, who assumed senior status on July 27, 2017.\n\nOregon's Democratic senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, said the nomination of Immergut reflected the bipartisan state judicial committee's decision that she was among \"the highest-qualified applicants, and exemplifies how the judicial selection process should work.''\n\nImmergut's nomination was announced on the same day that the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to forward to the Senate floor another judicial nomination, that of Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Bounds for a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacancy, which the Oregon senators opposed.\n\n-- Maxine Bernstein"
