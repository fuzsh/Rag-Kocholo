        "text": "The judge expected to oversee Donald Trump’s Jan 6 indictment is known for tough sentences on Capitol rioters and was appointed by Barack Obama.\n\nUS District Judge Tanya S Chutkan was also the federal judge who previously denied Mr Trump’s attempt to avoid disclosing documents to the House committee investigating the attack, writing in the ruling: “presidents are not kings”.\n\nA former assistant public defender and partner at a top law firm, Ms Chutkan was nominated to the District Court by Mr Obama in December 2013 and appointed in 2014.\n\nLast year an audit found she had consistently taken the hardest line of any judge serving on Washington’s federal trial court when sentencing Jan 6 offenders.\n\nIn several cases she gave tougher sentences than prosecutors sought, jailing defendants who pleaded guilty to petty offences. Her hardline approach drew indirect criticism from some colleagues.\n\n“Every day we’re hearing about reports of anti-democratic factions of people plotting violence, the potential threat of violence, in 2024,” she said before sentencing a Florida man who attacked police officers to more than five years behind bars.\n\n“It has to be made clear that trying to violently overthrow the government, trying to stop the peaceful transition of power and assaulting law enforcement officers in that effort is going to be met with absolutely certain punishment,” she said.\n\nJudge has ruled against Trump before\n\nMs Chutkan has ruled against Mr Trump before in a separate Jan 6 case.\n\nIn November 2021, she refused his request to block the release of documents to the House’s Jan 6 committee by asserting executive privilege. Ms Chutkan rejected his arguments that he could hold privilege over documents from his administration even after President Biden had cleared the way for the National Archives to turn the papers over.\n\nIn a memorable line from her ruling, Ms Chutkan wrote, “Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.”\n\nBorn in Kingston, Jamaica, Ms Chuktan grew up with a passion for dance before studying economics at George Washington University and University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nMs Chutkan, who will undoubtedly come under intense scrutiny over the coming months, previously spoke about developing a “thick skin” during her career to deal with comments about her race.\n\n“For a lot of people, I seem to check a lot of boxes: immigrant, woman, Black, Asian”, she said last year during a legal event for African American History Month.\n\nShe added: “Your qualifications are always going to be subject to criticism and you have to develop a thick skin.”\n\nShe also discussed the difficulties of juggling being a parent with her role as a public defender, remembering when during a murder trial she had to race home from court to feed her then nine-month-old son before going on to meet clients in jail."
