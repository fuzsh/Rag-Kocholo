        "text": "Brenda Sannes 2.JPG\n\nBrenda K. Sannes, an assistant U.S. attorney in Syracuse, stands outside the James M. Hanley Federal Building on Thursday in Syracuse after she was nominated by President Obama to serve as a federal judge.\n\n(Ken Sturtz | ksturtz@syracuse.com)\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Barack Obama today nominated a federal prosecutor in Syracuse to serve as the next U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of New York.\n\nObama asked the U.S. Senate to confirm Brenda K. Sannes, 55, of Skaneateles, for the Syracuse-based position. If confirmed, Sannes would be only the second woman to serve on the federal bench in Syracuse, and the third in the history of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York.\n\n\"I am proud to nominate Brenda K. Sannes to serve on the United States District Court bench,\" Obama said in a statement. \"She has a long and distinguished record of service, and I am confident she will serve on the federal bench with distinction.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Obama to appoint Sannes in a February recommendation. The senior senator of each state recommends judicial appointments to the White House.\n\nAt the time, Schumer said he was impressed by what Sannes had accomplished over two decades, and said he has always had a goal to elevate more women to the federal bench. Schumer said today he will do everything in his power to make sure Sannes is confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"Brenda Sannes is a legal professional of the first-order with decades of experience as a federal prosecutor,\" he said. \"She is uncommonly thorough, fair, and has a passionate commitment to an impartial application of the rule of law. It is no wonder she has such deep respect within, and beyond, the legal community.\"\n\nSannes has worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Syracuse for about 15 years, most recently as chief of the Appellate Bureau since 2005. She previously worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in the Central District of California (Los Angeles). In that post, she handled narcotics and money laundering cases.\n\nAs a prosecutor, Sannes has handled criminal cases involving narcotics, child exploitation, corruption, and health care fraud offenses, including an 11-week cocaine conspiracy trial.\n\nIf confirmed by senators, Sannes would fill the opening for a federal judge in Syracuse created when U.S. District Judge Norman Mordue switched to senior status. The judge's post pays $199,100 per year."
