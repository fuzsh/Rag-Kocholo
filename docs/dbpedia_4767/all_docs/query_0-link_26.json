        "text": "An ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) will most often be associated with an academic journal. In years gone by, the ISSN was observed as one measure of quality of a journal, although the logic behind that rationale was never queried. Other than its actual existence, few scientists know little else about the ISSN. Now, with an explosion of predatory, fraudulent and fake journals, mainly open access, the easy assignment of an ISSN to a journal should be a questionable parameter of quality. Most importantly, if the ISSN Center in France and its global affiliates take credit for being associated with so many academic journals which use an ISSN number on the covers of their journals and on their web-sites, then surely the same ISSN Centers have a share in the responsibility associated with the quality of those journals. This implies that any journal that has been assigned an ISSN and that in any way behaves unethically or fraudulently deserves to have its ISSN number retracted by the ISSN Center. The fact that this policy currently does not exist and that ISSN numbers are being assigned to journals, sometimes in batches of dozens or even hundreds, indicates that there is a serious problem with the policies at the ISSN, at least those related to the ISSN's responsibilities towards the academic community. This paper lists 67 key questions that the scientific community should be asking about the ISSN and that the ISSN has a responsibility to respond to since these aspects affect all scientists and ultimately one aspect of the integrity of science. Naturally, after this paper has been published, a follow-up paper will be published with the ISSN's responses to these questions. This paper establishes a simple system to ensure that the process of ISSN assignment and retraction are open and transparent processes. \" Any company, institute, society, or other establishment (such as publishers) that takes advantage of an intellectual base of scientists to make profit or to fortify their own profile also has to show responsibility towards that base. \" Jaime A. Teixeira da Silva A link between the scientific community and the ISSN is clearly established. The objective of this set of questions is to promote more transparency and greater understanding to the assignment of a number that is currently not sufficiently transparent, with clear inefficiencies and abuses by third parties, and for which answers to the scientific public are not being provided. The ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) is generally perceived to be one measure of quality of a paper or journal and thus, by association, the integrity of a publisher. An assessment of all data sets published as open access PDF files on the ISSN web-page as well as the June 2012 ISSN Manual indicate increasing trends for almost all aspects, in some cases exponential increases , indicating the strongly dependent nature of the scientific community, particularly publishers of journals, on the ISSN. However, although it is obvious that ISSN numbers are being assigned at an unprecedented level, the retraction of ISSN numbers is a less discussed topic, possibly because such a policy does not exist. Since such information is poorly transparent to the scientific community, and since the level of fraud and irregularities in journals and by publishers is increasing, focus should also be directed to the ISSN as being partly responsible for the out-of-control state of this fraud by unregulated assignment of ISSN numbers and by unregulated follow-ups of journals and publishers to whom ISSN numbers were assigned. Although not covered in this paper, the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is owned by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), but unlike the ISSN, ISBN numbers have a charge. The questions that the ISBN should be answering will be covered in a separate paper elsewhere. 67 key questions follow that I feel the ISSN has the responsibility of responding to in a structured format because it is intimately intertwined with the scientific community. Also, the ISSN web-site does not provide detailed responses to such queries. Hereafter, the word public refers to any member of public, including the scientific community."
