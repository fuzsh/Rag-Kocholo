        "text": "Summary: Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. They are called \"heuristics\" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines.\n\nThank you to Kelley Gordon for designing the visuals and posters included in this article.\n\nThank you to Kate Moran and Feifei Liu for updating the heuristic names, descriptions, and examples.\n\n1: Visibility of System Status\n\nThe design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nWhen users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand.\n\nTips\n\nCommunicate clearly to users what the system’s state is — no action with consequences to users should be taken without informing them.\n\nPresent feedback to the user as quickly as possible (ideally, immediately).\n\nBuild trust through open and continuous communication.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Visibility of System Status\n\n3-minute video about the Visibility Heuristic\n\n2: Match Between the System and the Real World\n\nThe design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.\n\nThe way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.\n\nWhen a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called natural mapping), it’s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive.\n\nTips\n\nEnsure that users can understand meaning without having to go look up a word’s definition.\n\nNever assume your understanding of words or concepts will match that of your users.\n\nUser research will uncover your users' familiar terminology, as well as their mental models around important concepts.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Match Between the System and the Real World\n\n2-minute video: Match Between the System and the Real World\n\n3: User Control and Freedom\n\nUsers often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked \"emergency exit\" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.\n\nWhen it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.\n\nTips\n\nSupport Undo and Redo.\n\nShow a clear way to exit the current interaction, like a Cancel button.\n\nMake sure the exit is clearly labeled and discoverable.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: User Control and Freedom\n\n2-minute video: User Control and Freedom\n\n4: Consistency and Standards\n\nUsers should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.\n\nJakob's Law states that people spend most of their time using digital products other than yours. Users’ experiences with those other products set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn something new.\n\nTips\n\nImprove learnability by maintaining both types of consistency: internal and external.\n\nMaintain consistency within a single product or a family of products (internal consistency).\n\nFollow established industry conventions (external consistency).\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Consistency and Standards\n\n3-minute video: Consistency and Standards\n\n5: Error Prevention\n\nGood error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.\n\nThere are two types of errors: slips and mistakes. Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between the user’s mental model and the design.\n\nTips\n\nPrioritize your effort: Prevent high-cost errors first, then little frustrations.\n\nAvoid slips by providing helpful constraints and good defaults.\n\nPrevent mistakes by removing memory burdens, supporting undo, and warning your users.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Preventing User Errors\n\n3-minute video: Error Prevention\n\n6: Recognition Rather than Recall\n\nMinimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.\n\nHumans have limited short-term memories. Interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.\n\nTips\n\nLet people recognize information in the interface, rather than forcing them to remember (“recall”) it.\n\nOffer help in context, instead of giving users a long tutorial to memorize.\n\nReduce the information that users have to remember.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Recognition vs. Recall in UX\n\n3-minute video: Recognition vs. Recall\n\n7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use\n\nShortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.\n\nFlexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick whichever method works for them.\n\nTips\n\nProvide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures.\n\nProvide personalization by tailoring content and functionality for individual users.\n\nAllow for customization, so users can make selections about how they want the product to work.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: The 7th Usability Heuristic Explained\n\n3-minute video: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use\n\n8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design\n\nInterfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.\n\nThis heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design — it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary goals.\n\nTips\n\nKeep the content and visual design of UI focused on the essentials.\n\nDon't let unnecessary elements distract users from the information they really need.\n\nPrioritize the content and features to support primary goals.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (Usability Heuristic #8)\n\n3-minute video: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design\n\n9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors\n\nError messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.\n\nThese error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them.\n\nTips\n\nUse traditional error-message visuals, like bold, red text.\n\nTell users what went wrong in language they will understand — avoid technical jargon.\n\nOffer users a solution, like a shortcut that can solve the error immediately.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Error-Message Guidelines\n\n2-minute video: Helping Users Overcome Errors\n\n10: Help and Documentation\n\nIt’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.\n\nHelp and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the user's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out.\n\nTips\n\nEnsure that the help documentation is easy to search.\n\nWhenever possible, present the documentation in context right at the moment that the user requires it.\n\nList concrete steps to be carried out.\n\nLearn more\n\nFull article: Help and Documentation: The 10th Usability Heuristic\n\n3-minute video: Help and Documentation\n\nFree 10 Heuristics Poster\n\nDownload a free summary poster or 10 detailed posters of the 10 Usability Heuristics, designed by Kelley Gordon, Kate Moran, and Feifei Liu.\n\nNote from Jakob\n\nI originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen and Molich 1990]. Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b].\n\nIn 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions, the 10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994. When something has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.\n\nSee Also\n\nExamples\n\n10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Complex Applications — Examples of the heuristics applied to complex and domain-specific software applications.\n\n10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Virtual Reality — See the heuristics applied to 3D virtual environments.\n\n10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Video Games — Great examples of the 10 heuristics in highly interactive and highly visual user interfaces that have an entertainment purpose.\n\n10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Everyday Life (Just for fun)\n\nChecklists & Guidelines\n\nFull set of 2,397 UX design guidelines (across multiple reports).\n\nBruce \"Tog\" Tognazzini's list of basic principles for interface design.
