Recently, CMTM3 has emerged as a potential target for treating diseases related to bone formation. However, additional studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which CMTM3 regulates the process of osteogenic differentiation. In this study, we observed a significant downregulation of Cmtm3 expression during the transdifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into osteoblasts induced by BMP4. Cmtm3 overexpression suppressed proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in BMP4-induced C2C12 cells, whereas its knockdown conversely facilitated the process. Mechanistically, Cmtm3 overexpression upregulated both the protein and mRNA levels of p53 and p21. Conversely, Cmtm3 knockdown exerted the opposite effects. Additionally, we found that Cmtm3 interacts with p53 and increases protein stability by inhibiting proteasome-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, Trp53 downregulation abrogated the inhibitory effect of Cmtm3 on BMP4-induced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. Collectively, our findings provide key insights into the role of CMTM3 in regulating myoblast proliferation and transdifferentiation into osteoblasts, highlighting its significance in osteogenesis research.

Based on preliminary bioinformatical analyses DTYMK and PARP1 were selected as potential therapeutic targets. High levels of both proteins were detected in uveal melanoma cells and correlated with increased tumor growth and poor prognosis. In vitro tests on MP41 (BAP1 positive) and MP46 (BAP1 negative) cancer cell lines using inhibitors pamiparib (PARP1) and Ymu1 (DTYMK) demonstrated significant cytotoxic effects. Combined treatment had synergistic effects in MP41 and additive in MP46 cell lines, reducing cell proliferation and inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, the applied inhibitors in combination decreased cell motility and migration speed, especially for BAP1-negative cell lines. Our hypothesis of the double hit into tumoral DNA metabolism as a possible therapeutic option in uveal melanoma was confirmed since combined targeting of DTYMK and PARP1 affected all tested cytophysiological parameters with the highest efficiency. Our in vitro findings provide insights into novel therapeutic avenues for managing uveal melanoma, warranting further exploration in preclinical and clinical settings.

However, the current ESG scoring systems lack uniformity and are often subjective. It is of great importance to be able to make accurate predictions regarding the ESG scores of corporations. A Stacked Generalization Model that employs Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) as base learners, with Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) as the meta-model for integrating the predictions of these diverse models is proposed. The goal is to develop an ESG score prediction model for Chinese companies. The experimental data set encompasses Chinese A-share listed companies from 2012 to 2020. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) are employed for model evaluation and are compared with seven benchmark models. The results demonstrate that SGM-BRR reduces the RMSE by 18.4%, 17.3%, 13.7%, and 76.1%, the MAE by 15.4%, 18.4%, 15.8%, and 68.4%, and increases the R2 by 2%, 1.4%, 2%, and 6% for ESG, E, S, and G scores, respectively. Furthermore, the model’s performance is validated across different industries, with SGM-BRR exhibiting the most optimal performance of RMSE, MAE, and R2 in 27, 25, and 27 groups, respectively. Consequently, the model demonstrates broad applicability and stability performance in ESG score prediction.

Prior to the 2023–2024 outbreak in French Guiana, DENV-3 had not circulated in an epidemic manner since 2005. We therefore studied retrospectively the strains circulating in the French Territories of the Americas (FTA)—French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Martinique—from the 2000s to the current epidemic. To this end, DENV-3 samples from the collection of the National Reference Center for Arboviruses in French Guiana (NRCA-FG) were selected and sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT. Phylogenetic analysis showed that (i) the 97 FTA sequences obtained all belonged to genotype III (GIII); (ii) between the 2000s and 2013, the regional circulation of the GIII American-I lineage was the source of the FTA cases through local extinctions and re-introductions; (iii) multiple introductions of lineages of Asian origin appear to be the source of the 2019–2021 epidemic in Martinique and the 2023–2024 epidemic in French Guiana. Genomic surveillance is a key factor in identifying circulating DENV genotypes, monitoring strain evolution, and identifying import events.

In order to reduce the risk of urban flooding and contribute to the sustainable development of the urban economy, society, and environment, this study takes Zhengzhou City as the study area. The surface runoff during extreme rainfall events from 2005 to 2023 was simulated using the SCS-CN model, and the spatiotemporal patterns of surface runoff during extreme rainfall conditions and their influencing factors were investigated. The results showed that (1) the average annual extreme rainfall in the study area was 95.6 mm, and the average annual surface runoff was 76.5 mm, with cultivated land contributing the most to surface runoff, accounting for more than 50%. The annual average frequency of extreme rainfall in the study area ranged from 0 to 3 times. (2) During the extreme rainfall events in 2021 and 2023, the surface runoff of the main urban area was relatively great. Under the influence of impermeable surfaces, the surface runoff of the main urban area was greater than that of the surrounding area, even when the rainfall in the main urban area was less than that in the surrounding urban area. In addition, during these two extreme rainfall events, the surface runoff in the slight slope (<5°) area was the greatest; overall, the larger the slope was, the smaller the surface runoff. (3) Differences between rainfall and surface runoff (DRS) of the different administrative districts in the study area showed three trends from 2005 to 2020, with those of most areas showing a clear decreasing trend, which was affected mainly by the surface runoff potential of the land use type. Under the same rainfall conditions (110 mm), the surface runoff of urban land and construction land was 1.4–2.5 times that of various types of woodland and grassland. From 2005 to 2020, the area of urban land and other construction land increased by 104.13%, the coverage area of woodland and grassland decreased by 35.90%, and the surface runoff potential increased in most areas of the study area. To reduce the risk of urban waterlogging, most areas of Zhengzhou, especially the main urban area and slight slope areas, need to rationally regulate land use and increase the coverage ratio of woodland and grassland.

This paper provides an overview of the current development status of salt cavern storage technologies both domestically and internationally, analyzes the advantageous conditions and numerous challenges faced by salt cavern Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) storage in China, and forecasts the development trends of this technology. The conclusions indicate that China possesses all of the necessary conditions for the development of salt cavern storage. Moreover, utilizing the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a macro suitability hierarchical evaluation system is constructed for the site selection and construction of salt cavern storage facilities. This system quantifies various site selection indicators, integrating expert opinions and findings from relevant theoretical research to establish grading standards for the suitability indices of salt cavern storage construction. Applied to the site evaluation of salt cavern storage at the Jintan Salt Mine in Jiangsu, the results indicate its high suitability for storage construction, making it an ideal location for establishing such facilities. The evaluation results are consistent with expert opinions, demonstrating the rationality of this method.

Recognizing the interplay among these conditions and their impact on suicidal tendencies is crucial for effective clinical management. Methods: A total sample of 147 subjects with MDD was divided into Significant Catatonia (SC) and Non-Significant Catatonia (NSC) groups based on Catatonia Spectrum (CS) scores. Participants were evaluated through the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Research Version (SCID-5-RV), the Adult Autism Subtreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), and the Mood Spectrum—Self Report questionnaires. Statistical analyses included Mann–Whitney U test, Chi-square test, logistic regression analyses, and a decision tree model. Results: The SC group exhibited higher CS, AdAS Spectrum, and MOODS-SR total and domain scores compared to the NSC group. Individuals with significant autistic traits were over-represented in the SC group, as well as participants with higher suicidality, suicidal ideation, and a history of suicide attempts. The total AdAS Spectrum and MOOD-SR score, the AdAS domain “Hyper-hypo reactivity to sensory input”, and the “Cognitive depressive” MOOD-SR domain were predictive of belonging to the SC group Suicidality levels appeared to be higher in clinically significant ASD, intermediate in subjects with autistic traits (AT), and low in the absence of AT. Conclusions: the study suggests the existence of a specific phenotype of MDD associated with catatonia, characterized by elevated autistic traits and suicide risk.

Antibody testing is necessary to determine the body’s immune response to COVID-19 infection and also vaccination strategies. Among the various methods available, the chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) test is more widely used and accessible to determine antibody levels. This study aimed to determine the protection level of S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG using CLIA compared to the Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (SVNT). The population of this study comprised all healthcare professionals who experienced S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level examinations. S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels were examined using CLIA and SVNT. The cut-off was determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) measurements were evaluated. The result showed a strong positive correlation between S-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA and SVNT, with a value of r = 0.933 and p < 0.001. The value ≥ 37.29 BAU/mL was determined as the cut-off based on SVNT 30% inhibition level with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 96.5%, 90.9%, 96.5%, and 90.9%, respectively. A titer of antibodies greater than or equal to 37.29 BAU/mL with CLIA showed the presence of protective antibodies compared to SVNT.

The Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) standard and its concomitant Cryptographically Generated Addressing (CGA) scheme were accepted by large standard bodies to codify practical mitigations. SEND and CGA have never seen widespread adoption due to their complexities, obscurity, costs, compatibility issues, and continued lack of mature implementations. In light of their poor adoption, research since their standardization has continued to find new perspectives and proffer new ideas. The orthodox solutions for securing Neighbor Discovery have historically struggled to successfully harmonize three core ideals: simplicity, flexibility, and privacy preservation. This research introduces Voucher-Based Addressing, a low-configuration, low-cost, and high-impact alternative to IPv6 address generation methods. It secures the Neighbor Discovery address resolution process while remaining simple, highly adaptable, indistinguishable, and privacy-focused. Applying a unique concoction of cryptographic key derivation functions, link-layer address binding, and neighbor consensus on the parameters of address generation, the resolved address bindings are verifiable without the need for complex techniques that have hindered the adoption of canonical specifications.

To overcome this, a bioeconomic approach proposes the use of the fibers for paper and board production, which requires high-quality silage with minimal butyric acid, which affects the marketability of the fibers. This study aims to optimize the silaging process of Silphium perfoliatum by investigating the effects of harvest date, bacterial cultures and additives on fermentation results. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of three harvest dates on fermentation acid composition, with a focus on increasing lactic acid production to inhibit butyric acid formation. Results indicate that an early harvest date (early September) is critical for achieving stable fermentation and minimizing ensiling losses. The addition of sugar-rich additives, such as syrup, was found to be essential, especially for later harvest dates. Despite these interventions, a late harvest (early November) consistently resulted in suboptimal fermentation. The results suggest that optimizing harvest timing and incorporating appropriate additives are key strategies for producing high quality silage and ensuring the suitability of Silphium perfoliatum fibers for industrial applications.

This study focuses on dolomite and limestone samples, all with porosities below 3%, an area not extensively covered in previous literature. Significant endothermic effects were observed at temperatures below −2 °C, challenging conventional understanding. The study reveals that the latent heat of phase change in these systems can exceed 334.2 J/g, the known value for bulk water, indicating unique thermodynamic properties of water in confined spaces. For the dolomite rock sample, observed endothermic heat effects below −2 °C were 23.5% and 26.7% of total phase change energy. The cumulative pore volume calculated using the thermoporometry method was found to be higher than expected from water occupancy alone, independent of assumptions about the thickness of the adsorbed unfreezable water layer or pore shape (spherical or cylindrical). This research provides novel insights into unfrozen water content calculations, significantly enhancing frost durability assessments and the geoengineering industry.

Memory T-lymphocytes (CD45RA−/CD45RO+) play a crucial role in immune reconstitution post-HSCT. The infusion of memory T cells is proven to be safe and effective in improving outcomes due to the enhanced reconstitution of immunity and increased protection against viremia, without exacerbating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) risks. Studies indicate their persistence and efficacy in combating viral pathogens, suggesting a viable therapeutic avenue for patients. Conversely, using virus-specific T cells for viremia control presents challenges, such as regulatory hurdles, cost, and production time compared to CD45RA-memory T lymphocytes. Additionally, the modulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) for therapeutic use has become an important area of investigation in GVHD, playing a pivotal role in immune tolerance modulation, potentially mitigating GVHD and reducing pharmacological immunosuppression requirements. Finally, donor T cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia immune responses hold promise in curbing relapse rates post-HSCT, providing a multifaceted approach to therapeutic intervention in high-risk disease scenarios. This comprehensive review underscores the multifaceted roles of T lymphocytes in HSCT outcomes and identifies avenues for further research and clinical application.

Thus far, several Elovls have been extensively studied in teleost. However, the functional and physiological roles of Elovls in chondrichthyans have rarely been reported. In this study, we identified and characterized elovl2 from the endangered Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) by whole genome scanning. The results show that the coding sequence of elovl2 was 894 bp in length, for a putative protein of 297 amnio acids. Comparative genomic analyses indicated that Chinese sturgeon elovl2 was evolutionarily conserved. Functional characterization in yeast demonstrated that the Chinese sturgeon Elovl2 could efficiently elongate C20 (ARA and EPA) and C22 (22:4n-6 and 22:5n-3) substrates, confirming its critical roles in LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Spatial and temporal expression analyses showed high elovl2 mRNA levels were detected in the liver and brain and showed an increase trend both in embryonic and post-hatching stages. Interestingly, diets with vegetable oils as lipid sources could significantly induce the high expression of elovl2 in Chinese sturgeon, implying that the endogenous LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway was stimulated by lack of LC-PUFA in their diets. Our findings will enhance our understanding about the evolutionary and functional roles of elovl2 and provide novel insights into the LC-PUFA biosynthesis mechanism in vertebrates.

Despite pollution control being an issue in both urban and rural regions, most of the available research has concentrated on urban districts. Hence, investigations into how urban–rural transition affects PM2.5 are warranted within the framework of urban–rural integration. Using the Yellow River Basin as a case study, this study employed the entropy method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to uncover the extent of urban–rural transformation. It then used the spatial autocorrelation method to investigate the spatiotemporal features of PM2.5 and the spatial econometric model to investigate the mechanisms that influence the relationship between urban–rural transformation and PM2.5. The results are as follows: (1) The level of urban–rural transformation shows an obvious upward trend with time. The development has progressed from asymmetrical north-east and south-west elevations to a more balanced pattern of north-east, middle-east, and west-west elevations. (2) The PM2.5 concentration increased steadily, then fluctuated, and finally decreased. Notably, the general pattern has not changed much, and it is high in the east and low in the west. (3) Different subsystems of the urban–rural transformation have different impacts on air pollution at different stages. The influence of industrial transformation (IT) on PM2.5 showed an inverted “N-shaped” curve of negative–negative–changes, and the industrial structure played a leading role in the spatiotemporal evolution of PM2.5. An inverted “U-shaped” curve forms the left side of the impact of population transition (PT) on PM2.5. Land transformation (LT) has a “U-shaped” curve for its effect on PM2.5. This study provides a new perspective on the topic of PM2.5 and its connection to urban–rural integration, which is crucial to understanding the dynamics of this shift. To achieve the goal of high-quality development, this study supports regional initiatives to reduce PM2.5 emissions in the Yellow River Basin. Moreover, the results of this study can provide a reference for decision-makers in the world’s densely populated areas that suffer from serious air pollution.

This scanner employs an array of depth sensors, i.e., time-of-flight (ToF) sensors, each controlled by dedicated embedded devices. The sensors generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds, which are automatically stitched using a point could segmentation approach through deep learning. The deep learner combines raw RGB and depth data to identify correspondences between the multiple 3D point clouds, thus creating a single and accurate mesh that reconstructs the cattle geometry on the fly. In order to evaluate the performance of our system, we implemented a two-fold validation process. Initially, we quantitatively tested the scanner for its ability to determine accurate volume and surface area measurements in a controlled environment featuring known objects. Next, we explored the impact and need for multi-device synchronization when scanning moving targets (cattle). Finally, we performed qualitative and quantitative measurements on cattle. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of producing high-quality meshes of untamed cattle with accurate volume and surface area measurements for livestock studies.

Ablation of large tumors requires treating them with a sequence of single HIFU beams, with a specific time interval in-between. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological effects induced in a malignant solid tumor of the rat mammary gland, implanted in adult Wistar rats, during HIFU treatment according to a new ablation plan which allowed researchers to significantly shorten the duration of the procedure. We used a custom, automated, ultrasound imaging-guided HIFU ablation device. Tumors with a 1 mm thickness margin of healthy tissue were subjected to HIFU. Three days later, the animals were sacrificed, and the HIFU-treated tissues were harvested. The biological effects were studied, employing morphological, histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural techniques. Massive cell death, hemorrhages, tissue loss, influx of immune cells, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the HIFU-treated tumors. No damage to healthy tissues was observed in the area surrounding the safety margin. These results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed shortened duration of the HIFU ablation procedure and its potential for the treatment of solid tumors.

Cancer development is often driven by the accumulation of somatic mutations that can cause alterations in tissue functions and morphologies. In this work, a method based on a deep neural network integrated into a network-based stratification framework (D3NS) is proposed to stratify tumors according to somatic mutations. (2) Methods: This approach leverages the power of deep neural networks to detect hidden information in the data by combining the knowledge contained in a network of gene interactions, as typical of network-based stratification methods. D3NS was applied using real-world data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for bladder, ovarian, and kidney cancers. (3) Results: This technique allows for the identification of tumor subtypes characterized by different survival rates and significant associations with several clinical outcomes (tumor stage, grade or response to therapy). (4) Conclusion: D3NS can provide a base model in cancer research and could be considered as a useful tool for tumor stratification, offering potential support in clinical settings.

A variety of hybrid compositions was synthesized. Both reference samples and heterostructured materials were characterized in detail, regarding their morphology, crystalline character, chemical speciation, as well as vibrational properties. The abovementioned physicochemical characterization suggested the absence of doping phenomena, such as the integration of either zinc or indium ions into the CdS lattice. At specific compositions, the growth of the amorphous ZnIn2S4 component was observed through both XRD and Raman analysis. The development of heterojunctions was found to be composition-dependent, as indicated by the simultaneous recording of the Raman profiles of both semiconductors. The optical band gaps of the hybrids range at values between the corresponding band gaps of reference semiconductors. The photocatalytic activity was assessed in both organic dye degradation and hydrogen peroxide evolution. It was observed that the hybrids demonstrating efficient photocatalytic activity in dye degradation were rather poor photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide evolution. Specifically, the hybrids enriched in the CdS component were shown to act efficiently for hydrogen peroxide evolution, whereas ZnIn2S4-enriched hybrids demonstrated high potential to photodegrade an azo-type organic dye. Furthermore, scavenging experiments suggested the involvement of singlet oxygen in the mechanistic path for dye degradation.

Due to the lack of effective integration of spatial correlation, the prediction model shows poor performance in PM2.5 prediction tasks. Predicting air pollution levels accurately over a long period is difficult because of the changing levels of correlation between past pollution levels and the future. In order to address these challenges, the study introduces a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network-based neural network model with multiple feature extraction for forecasting PM2.5 levels in air quality prediction. The technique is composed of three components. The model-building process of this article is as follows: Firstly, we create a complex network layout with multiple branches to capture various temporal features at different levels. Secondly, a convolutional module was introduced to enable the model to focus on identifying neighborhood units, extracting feature scales with high spatial correlation, and helping to improve the learning ability of ConvLSTM. Next, the module for spatiotemporal fusion prediction is utilized to make predictions of PM2.5 over time and space, generating fused prediction outcomes that combine characteristics from various scales. Comparative experiments were conducted. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed approach outperforms ConvLSTM in forecasting PM2.5 concentration for the following day, three days, and seven days, resulting in a lower root mean square error (RMSE). This approach excels in modeling spatiotemporal features and is well-suited for predicting PM2.5 levels in specific regions.

The model acknowledges uncertainty by embedding uncertain parameters that promote resilience and efficiency. It focuses on minimizing costs while maximizing on-time deliveries and optimizing key decision variables such as production setups, quantities, inventory levels, and backorders. Extensive simulations and numerical results confirm the model’s effectiveness in providing robust solutions to dynamically changing supply chain problems when compared to conventional models. However, the integrated model introduces substantial computational complexity, which may pose challenges in large-scale real-world applications. Additionally, the model’s reliance on precise probabilistic and fuzzy parameters may limit its applicability in environments with insufficient or imprecise data. Despite these limitations, the proposed approach has the potential to significantly enhance supply chain resilience and efficiency, offering valuable insights for both academia and industry.

Recently, the use of modern imaging technologies has increased the diagnosis of CAP, providing important findings for risk stratification. Nevertheless, there is not yet consensus regarding therapeutic decisions, and the management of patients with CAP remains challenging. In this paper, we discuss the pathophysiological implication of CAP, review the current literature and explain the role of multimodality imaging tools for its diagnosis, management and treatment.

Specifically, non-conventional finite element families for solving Navier–Stokes equations are investigated to address the mathematical constraint of incompressible flows. Raviart–Thomas finite elements are employed for the achievement of a discrete free-divergence velocity. In particular, the proposed algorithm projects the velocity field into the discrete free-divergence space by using the lowest-order Raviart–Thomas element. This decomposition is applied in the context of the projection method, a numerical algorithm employed for solving Navier–Stokes equations. Numerical examples validate the approach’s effectiveness, considering different types of computational grids. Additionally, the presented paper considers an interface advection problem using marker approximation in the context of multiphase flow simulations. Numerical tests, equipped with an analytical velocity field for the surface advection, are presented to compare exact and non-exact divergence-free velocity interpolation.

However, it remains unclear whether any antibiotics may stimulate the host immune response by affecting bacterial activity. In this study, reasoning that genetic mutations inhibit bacterial activities and, thereby, may mimic the effects of antibiotics, we performed genome-wide screening and identified 77 E. coli genes whose inactivation induces C. elegans cyp-14A4, representing an innate immune and detoxification response. Further analyses reveal that this host immune response can clearly be induced through either inactivating the E. coli respiratory chain via the bacterial cyoB mutation or using the antibiotic Q203, which is able to enhance host survival when encountering the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mechanistically, the innate immune response triggered by both the cyoB mutation and Q203 is found to depend on the host brain response, as evidenced by their reliance on the host neural gene unc-13, which is required for neurotransmitter release in head neurons. Therefore, our findings elucidate the critical involvement of the microbiota–brain axis in modulating the host immune response, providing mechanistic insights into the role of antibiotics in triggering the host immune response and, thus, facilitating host defense against pathogens.
