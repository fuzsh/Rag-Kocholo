        "text": "What is an ISSN?\n\nTo the head of this page\n\nAdvantages of ISSN\n\nTo the head of this page\n\nISSN and Key Titles *\n\nA key title is a unique title created for registration of an ISSN. It establishes an inseparable one-to-one correspondence between each serial or other continuing resource and its ISSN.\n\nLike an ISSN which is a unique number, a key title is also unique: i.e., one key title cannot be shared by more than one publication.\n\nOnce assigned to a publication, an ISSN will never be reused in another publication even if the first publication becomes defunct.\n\nIf the key title must be changed, the ISSN of the publication is also changed irrespective of the reasons for change such as the merger or split of serials and other continuing resources.\n\nKey titles are established by the ISSN Network in accordance with its cataloging rules.\n\nApplicants are informed of the ISSN and the key title by the formal notice of ISSN (only in Japanese) sent by the Japanese Centre.\n\n* The key title is the Romanized form of the title proper (=main title) of a serial or other continuing resource. In the case of a title proper in a Western language (Latin characters), in principle, the key title is identical with the title proper. If there are more than one publication which share the same title proper, the one which is registered later will have qualifying information.\n\nExample:ã \"å½éå­ã©ãå³æ¸é¤¨ã®çª\"\n\nThe key title of print edition: Kokusai Kodomo Toshokan no mado\n\nThe key title of online edition: Kokusai Kodomo Toshokan no mado (Online)\n\nIf a publication has its key title in a Western language, the abbreviated key title is also recorded. Abbreviations are made according to the List of Title Word Abbreviations maintained by the ISSN International Centre.\n\nTo the head of this page\n\nOutline of ISSN-L\n\nISSN-L is an abbreviation for Linking ISSN. If a publication is published in more than one media format, they share the same ISSN-L though the ISSN assigned for each format differ from each other. An ISSN-L is the same as one of the ISSN for the publications which share the same ISSN-L.\n\nExample:ã\"National Diet Library newsletter\"\n\nPrint edition:ã ISSN 0027-9161 ISSN-L 0027-9161\n\nOnline edition: ISSN 1344-7238 ISSN-L 0027-9161\n\nTo the head of this page\n\nThe ISSN Network and the Japanese National Centre for ISSN\n\nThe ISSN Network\n\nJapanese National Centre for ISSN\n\nTo the head of this page\n\nISSN and Deposits of Online Publications\n\nTo the head of this page\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nTo the head of this page"
