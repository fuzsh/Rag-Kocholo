        "text": "One of the most recognized international organizations in the world is the International Organization for Standardization. In 1946, delegates from 25 countries gathered in London to discuss issues related to unifying industry standards and facilitating their international coordination. This meeting laid the foundation for the creation of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nISO officially began operations on 23 February 1947. It is an independent, non-governmental organization made up of members from the national standards bodies of 165 countries. The three official languagesof the ISO are English, French, and Russian.\n\nThe purpose of ISO is formulated in the charter of this organization as follows: \"To promote the development of standardization throughout the world, to promote the international exchange of goods and to develop cooperation in the field of intellectual, scientific, technical and economic activities.\"\n\nBenefits of using the ISO standard:\n\nFor the client - is given the opportunity to choose and profitable as a result of competition between suppliers;\n\nFor the government - based on what legislation contains requirements for the protection of human health and the environment;\n\nFor trade - it opens a barrier to trade, sets a certain level in the international market and is used as a technical means to implement political trade agreements.\n\nFor developing countries - it allows them to make the right decisions in the investment process, and is a source of technological know-how for them.\n\nFor customers - compliance with standards makes quality, safety and reliability trustworthy.\n\nFor the community - helps to improve the quality of life, assures us that the vehicles, vehicles and equipment we use are safe;\n\nFor the planet - it determines the quality of air, water, soil, emitted gases and radiation levels, thereby protecting the environment.\n\nThere are three types of membership in the ISO: full members, correspondent members, and subscriber members.\n\nFull members - they are the most representative national standardization bodies in the field of standardization (one body from one country). When voting, they have one vote.\n\nCorrespondent members - they are countries whose activities in the field of national standardization are not fully developed. Their contribution is minimal, whereby published international standards and other news publications are provided.. They do not participate in technical work, but can receive information on issues of interest to them. Georgia is a corresponding member country.\n\nSubscriber members - they are countries with small economies but still in contact with ISO.\n\nISO GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE"
