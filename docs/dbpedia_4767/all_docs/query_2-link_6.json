        "text": "ISO: Standards Development Process\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 162 national standards bodies. Through its members, it brings together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-based, market-relevant international standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges.\n\nISO Technical Committees\n\nISO carries out its standards development work through more than 700 technical committees and subcommittees. Each technical committee is dedicated to a particular technology area and meets several times per year at locations around the world to discuss and vote on standards in development.\n\nISO Technical Committee 276 on Biotechnology (ISO/TC 276)\n\nDevelops standards relevant to regenerative medicine in the areas of:\n\nAnalytical methods\n\nBiobanks and bioresources\n\nBioprocessing\n\nData processing\n\nTerms and definitions\n\nISO/TC 150/Subcommittee 7 on Tissue-Engineered Medical Products\n\nDevelops standards for the tissue engineering sector. Select standards efforts from other ISO technical committees—including ISO/TC 194 on Biological and Clinical Evaluation of Medical Devices—are also relevant to regenerative medicine but are not all exclusive to the field.\n\nStandards Development Process\n\nISO has six standards development stages:\n\nProposal (New Work Item Proposal [NWIP]): The relevant technical committee evaluates proposed standards submitted by individuals or organizations. Upon approval, a work item is assigned to one of four development tracks corresponding to its target publication date (18, 24, 36, or 48 months).\n\nPreparatory (Working Draft [WD]): The technical committee sets up a working group to complete the draft. After several rounds of internal review and revision by the working group, the parent committee determines whether the draft should advance to the Committee Stage or skip to the Enquiry Stage.\n\n(Optional) Committee (Committee Draft [CD]): The draft undergoes successive rounds of review and comment by the parent committee until it arrives at a consensus.\n\nEnquiry (Draft International Standard [DIS]): ISO national members review the draft, and then request technical revisions or conduct a final vote.\n\n(As Needed) Approval (Final Draft International Standard [FDIS]): If technical changes were requested at the Enquiry Stage, the draft will be revised and undergo a final round of voting.\n\nPublication: The draft becomes a formal ISO standard.\n\nHow YouR Organization Can Participate in ISO Standards Development\n\nJoining a technical committee or subcommittee offers the opportunity to make your perspective heard and have direct input into developing standards. Technical committees formulate consensus positions with respect to draft ISO documents and are also able to propose new standards work at ISO."
