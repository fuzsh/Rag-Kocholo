        "text": "What is an ISSN?\n\nThe International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is an identification system that facilitates the clear identification for serial publications that are intended to appear indefinitely.\n\nTypical examples of serial publications include journals, newspapers, serials, scientific blogs and databases. In contrast, monographs (books) are labelled solely with an ISBN.\n\nThe ISSN is valid worldwide. Each publication is assigned an individual eight-digit number consisting of Arabic numerals from 0 to 9. The ISSN is identified by preceding this number with the letter “ISSN”. The final character is a check digit and can also be an “X” (e.g. ISSN 0176-6996, ISSN 1430-855X). This makes every publication unique.\n\nThe numeric format means that ISSN can be used worldwide irrespective of the language. Titles of periodicals can be the same or similar. Using ISSN to search for titles facilitates the precise identification of the work you are searching for. In the digital world, the ISSN serves as a unique identifier for identical works in different various databases and can be used to match them.\n\nThe ISSN standard is constantly undergoing further development to keep pace with the increase in digitalisation. When it was developed in the 1970s, the focus lay solely on its use for printed media works. Nowadays, ISSN are used as a matter of course for digital publications of all kinds.\n\nISSN centres\n\nThe assignment and administration of ISSN is a joint task carried out within a network. This network consists of national centres and the International ISSN Centre based in Paris. The International ISSN Centre coordinates the work of the national centres in more than 90 countries. The ISSN portal, an international database, already contains more than two million ISSN and their corresponding titles along with a brief bibliographic description.This number is growing daily.\n\nISSN are assigned by national centres in each country. The National ISSN Centre for Germany is located at the German National Library.\n\nPlease note that the National ISSN Centre for Germany is only responsible for publications that were initially issued in the Federal Republic of Germany. Otherwise, you can obtain information about the appropriate ISSN centre on the website of the International ISSN Centre.\n\nTo the International ISSN Centre\n\nTo the ISSN portal\n\nHow is an ISSN requested?\n\nWhen a new serial publication is deposited with the German National Library, most printed publications and media works stored on physical data carriers (CD-ROM, DVD)\n\nthat were first published in Germany and\n\nwhich meet the criteria of a serial publication (journals, yearbooks, annual reports, series)\n\nare assigned an ISSN directly. You do not have to request the assignment of an ISSN in such cases. The ISSN is assigned by the National ISSN Centre for Germany and can be found in the catalogue of the German National Library.\n\nFor publications released online, you must make an informal written application for the assignment of an ISSN:\n\nThe bibliographic information on the publication and the ISSN are displayed\n\nin the catalogue of the German National Library\n\nin the Deutsche Nationalbibliografie\n\nin the German Union Catalogue of Serials (ZDB)\n\nand in the international ISSN Portal\n\nISSN can also be assigned retrospectively. Here too, it is sufficient if an informal written application is sent to:\n\nAs a rule, we only assign an ISSN after a publication has been released. However, we offer major clients the option to have an ISSN assigned before the first issue is published (advance assignment). Persons making individual application can usually only be assigned an ISSN after the publication has been issued.\n\nIf you require the advance assignment of an ISSN, please send the necessary documents and a brief message to:\n\nFor this, we need\n\na draft of the title page and imprint,\n\nthe scheduled publication date,\n\nthe planned publication frequency and\n\ninformation as to whether the publication will be appearing in print and/or online.\n\nPrinted and online editions of a publication are assigned different ISSN even if the titles are identical. The main internet address must also be provided if an ISSN is to be assigned to an online publication in advance. This must be activated.\n\nYou should not apply for advance assignment of an ISSN more than six months before the publication is scheduled for release.\n\nA new ISSN must be obtained if a title changes. The same applies if the format of the publication changes, e.g. from a printed to an online publication. In these cases, please contact the National ISSN Centre for Germany:\n\nInserting ISSN in publications\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\nContact\n\nDeutsche Nationalbibliothek\n\nNationales ISSN-Zentrum für Deutschland\n\nAdickesallee 1\n\n60322 Frankfurt am Main"
