        "text": "International Organization for Standardization\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 10, 2024, 11:44 AM ET (The Hindu)\n\nAgricultural College and Research Institute in TNAU campus secures first-ever ISO accreditation by a constituent unit\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO), specialized international organization concerned with standardization in all technical and nontechnical fields except electrical and electronic engineering (the responsibility of the International Electrotechnical Commission [IEC]). Founded in Geneva in 1947, its membership extends to more than 160 countries. Each member is the national body “most representative of standardization in its country”; in Western industrial countries this is usually a private organization, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the British Standards Institution (BSI), but in most other countries it is a governmental organization.\n\nStandardization affects units of measurement; alphabetization and transliteration; specifications for parts, materials, surfaces, processes, tools, methods of testing, and machines; and even the form in which specifications are presented. ISO standards cover a variety of sectors, ranging from food safety to manufacturing to technology. Such standards help to facilitate international trade by establishing quality and other criteria between countries and to protect consumers by ensuring that products and services are certified to meet international minimums. In addition, ISO standards enable the entry of firms into new markets, both locally and internationally, by facilitating the direct comparison of products across markets. Upon request, the ISO establishes international technical committees to investigate and resolve specific issues of standardization. Because of technological evolution, ISO standards are optimally reviewed for possible revision every five years.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Melissa Petruzzello."
