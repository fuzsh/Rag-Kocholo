        "text": "One of the strengths of ISO standards is that they are created by the people that need them. Industry experts drive all aspects of the standard development process, from deciding whether a new standard is needed to defining all the technical content.\n\nGetting involved in this process can bring significant advantages to your business. For example by:\n\nGiving early access to information that could shape the market in the future\n\nGiving your company a voice in the development of standards\n\nHelping to keep market access open.\n\nGetting involved in standards development brings your concerns and needs to bear on a process that will affect you in the future.\n\nHow to get involved?\n\nStandards are developed by groups of experts called technical committees. These experts are put forward by ISO’s national members. If you are interested in getting involved, contact your national standards body. Your national standards body is the ISO member, and represents ISO in your country. Contact details can be found in the list of national members. Companies and individuals are not eligible to join ISO as members.\n\nViews from industry\n\nFor us the benefits [of participating in the development of standards] are twofold. First we bring our experience and expertise in chemicals and pharmaceuticals to the table. And second, we thereby ensure that our interests gain attention.\n\nDr Wolfgang Grosse Entrup, Head of Environment and Sustainability, Bayer AG, Germany\n\nBayer is a global enterprise with core competencies in the fields of healthcare, nutrition and high-tech materials\n\nThe payoff for engaging in standards work is greater than many small business people realize. Standards are both important and interesting. For a company like Baltic Safety, it’s essential to get involved with the working groups so we can get started early with our planning for future designs and production methods. Globalization means that ISO standards are key for any company that hopes to succeed in export markets.\n\nPer Frode, CEO Baltic Safety Products, Sweden\n\nBaltic Safety Products is the largest manufacturer of life jackets and buoyancy aids in Europe\n\nWithout standards I would have had to close down… Not taking part [in standardization] would have cost me my company and my livelihood… What does it cost me if I do not get involved and others define rules that are out of line with my needs, interests and experiences, but which I have to comply with because they are laid down in a standard ? Hence, it is best to join in right at the start.\n\nMartin Denison, Managing Director, Scuba Schools GmbH, Austria\n\nScuba Schools, Tauchausbildung GmbH is registered in Vienna and specializes in training recreational divers and diving instructors and in producing training materials.\n\nTaking part in standardization work on nanotechnology allows our company to have access to standardization developments. Furthermore, this gives us the opportunity to join in and defend current and future interests of Spanish industry. Participating in both national and international standardization committees is a key matter for our company. We are in a time of strong international growth and this participation will allow us to adapt our products to future international regulations.\n\nJulio Gomez, CEO, Avanzare, Spain\n\nAvanzare is a SME supplier of nanomaterials and nanotechnology based solutions."
