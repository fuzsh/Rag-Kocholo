These international standards bring about continuous improvement while safeguarding the interests of both consumers and businesses. By implementing these guidelines, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to excellence and compliance, facilitating global trade and fostering trust in their brand. In this extensive article, we delve into the core aspects of ISO standards, exploring their definition, applications, and the profound impact they have on industries worldwide.\n\nWhat is ISO?\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, is an independent, non-governmental international organization that was established on February 23, 1947. Over the years, it has published more than 22,500 international standards covering almost every industry.
