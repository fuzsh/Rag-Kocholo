        "text": "Selecting a provider that adheres to ISO standards can be a wise decision, offering the reassurance that your organization is working with a provider that has implemented robust systems to ensure consistency, reduce risk, and deliver results.\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\nINSIDE THIS ARTICLE, YOU'LL FIND:\n\nWhat is ISO?\n\nWhy do ISO standards matter?\n\nExamples of popular ISO standards\n\nISO certification\n\nFor businesses operating in today's globalized economy, it's important for organizations to partner with reputable service providers that can offer high-quality products or services while minimizing risks. Whether you're seeking a supplier, vendor, or any other type of business partner, evaluating them can be a challenge. This is where the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) comes in.\n\nISO establishes globally recognized standards for various aspects of operations and management, providing a framework that can help you evaluate potential business partners and make informed decisions. Organizations that comply with, or are certified by, ISO standards are more likely to deliver better products or services, and have made a commitment to identifying and mitigating risks on an on-going basis through audits. In short, by partnering with ISO-compliant organizations, you ensure that you're working with a reliable partner.\n\nWHAT IS ISO?\n\nISO, or the International Organization for Standardization, is an independent, non-governmental organization that develops and publishes standards for various industries and sectors worldwide. ISO's objective is to promote and facilitate international trade by developing and promoting standards that ensure safety, quality, and efficiency of products and services.\n\nISO standards are developed through a consensus-based process that involves stakeholders from industry, government, and other interested parties from all over the world, drawn from global technical committees. The standards developed by ISO are voluntary and provide a framework for organizations to improve their management practices and processes, reduce risk, and achieve operational excellence. These standards cover a wide range of topics, from quality management to environmental management, occupational health and safety, information security, and many more.\n\n\"The standards developed by ISO are voluntary and provide a framework for organizations to improve their management practices and processes, reduce risk, and achieve operational excellence.\"\n\nOne of the key characteristics of ISO standards is their universal applicability. ISO standards are developed through a global consensus-based process, ensuring that they are applicable to organizations of all sizes, types, and industries worldwide. This makes it easier for organizations to adopt and implement these standards, regardless of their location or business sector.\n\nISO standards are also designed to be flexible and adaptable, enabling organizations to customize and integrate them into their existing management systems and processes. This helps organizations to achieve better alignment and consistency in their operations, cut down on duplication of effort, and improve overall efficiency.\n\nBy following ISO standards, organizations can ultimately enhance their competitive advantage in their markets, and their customers can feel confident that they are working with partners who share their commitment to excellence.\n\nWHY DO ISO STANDARDS MATTER?\n\nISO standards matter for several reasons:\n\nThis last point is critically important for prospective customers to consider when selecting a service provider. For example, ISO 31030 (which covers travel risk management) matters for duty of care providers because it provides a globally recognized framework for managing risks and ensuring the safety and well-being of employees while traveling or working abroad. Though ISO adherence doesn’t guarantee best-in-class results, you can be more certain of the provider’s ability to deliver those results if they are ISO certified.\n\nWho should care about ISO standards?\n\nA commitment to ISO standards matters to a wide range of people, including businesses, consumers, and governments.\n\n\"For businesses, compliance with ISO standards can help increase operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the quality of products or services.\"\n\nFor businesses, compliance with ISO standards can help increase operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the quality of products or services. They also help businesses meet legal and regulatory requirements, as well as increase their credibility and reputation. Consumers benefit from ISO standards by knowing that products and services they purchase are safe, reliable, and of high quality. Governments can also benefit from ISO standards by setting them as legal requirements, helping to ensure public safety and environmental protection.\n\nExamples of Popular ISO Standards\n\nThere are thousands of ISO standards, covering a wide range of industries and sectors. New standards are regularly developed to address emerging challenges and technologies.\n\nThat said, it’s unlikely that anyone would need to be familiar with every single ISO. Some are used and adhered to more often than others. Common ISO standards related to the security of your operations and workforce include:\n\nISO 27001 — Information Security Management: This standard provides a framework for managing and protecting sensitive information and data, helping businesses to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information.\n\nISO 31000 — Risk Management: This standard provides a framework for businesses to identify, assess, and manage risks effectively, enabling them to make informed decisions and minimize potential losses.\n\nISO 31030 — Travel Risk Management: This standard provides guidelines for businesses to manage the risks associated with business travel, ensuring the safety and security of their employees when traveling for work.\n\nISO 22301 — Business Continuity Management: This standard provides a framework for businesses to ensure that they can continue to operate in the event of a disruption, such as a natural disaster or cyberattack, minimizing the impact on their operations and reputation.\n\nISO certification\n\nTo ensure that the partner you choose to do business with adheres to ISO standards, you may want to check to ensure they are ISO certified, if available. Keep in mind that the ISO simply develops these international standards and does not certify them itself. Third parties, such as the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) or International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) perform these assessments and certifications.\n\nHow to ensure your provider follows ISO standards\n\nWhen selecting a third-party provider that claims ISO certification, it is important to verify their certification and adherence to the standards. Here are four steps you can take to ensure your provider follows ISO standards:\n\nThe responsibility for ISO compliance can vary depending on the size and structure of the organization. In some cases, a dedicated ISO manager or team may be responsible for overseeing compliance with ISO standards. In smaller organizations, it may be the responsibility of senior management or quality assurance personnel. Ultimately, it is important for all employees to understand the organization's ISO policies and procedures and to be committed to maintaining compliance with the standards.\n\nMinimize risks and maximize results with ISO-compliant vendors\n\nBy ensuring compliance with ISO standards, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to quality, safety, and sustainability, as well as improve their overall performance and reputation. As such, selecting a service provider that adheres to ISO standards can be a wise decision, offering the reassurance that your organization is working with a provider that has implemented robust systems to ensure consistency, reduce risk, and deliver results.\n\nGLOBAL GUARDIAN Standing by to Support\n\nGlobal Guardian is proud to be ISO 27001:2013 certified to protect our client's business information and safeguard their data.
