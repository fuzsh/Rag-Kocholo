        "text": "What are standards in this context?\n\nA standard is a document, established by a consensus of subject matter experts and approved by a recognized body that provides guidance on the design, use or performance of materials, products, processes, services, systems or persons.\n\nSome details of the common elements of an International Standard and its development can be found in My ISO job. Many national standards follow the same format.\n\nStandards can be developed by national, regional and international standards developing organizations and also by businesses or other organizations for their own internal use. They can also be developed by consortia of businesses to address a specific marketplace need, or by government departments to support regulations. This module is most concerned with standards produced by the international standards organizations, ISO and IEC, and their national members.\n\nThe formal definition from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and its sister organization, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is: a document, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.\n\nWhereas IECâs scope of work is specifically electrical and electrotechnical standardization, ISOâs work programme encompasses virtually all other areas except telecommunications which is covered by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). However, a joint technical committee of ISO and IEC (JTC1)1 deals with information technology standardization.\n\n1NOTE:\n\nThere are other organizations whose standardization activity is international in nature. These organizations often work in liaison with ISO Technical Committees (TCs) developing standards in their areas of expertise. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is involved in many areas of ISO's work.\n\nStandards are voluntary agreements, developed within an open process that gives all stakeholders, including consumers, the opportunity to express their views and have those views considered. This contributes to their fairness and market relevance, and promotes confidence in their use.\n\nISO has formalized these concepts within its Code of Ethics and its Strategic Plan, which both underline the importance of consumer participation in standards development.\n\nISO and IEC also produce other standards-related documents. For more information, see \"Joining in: participating in international standardization\", âInvolving consumers â Why and howâ, and âGuidance for National Standards Bodies on engaging stakeholdersâ in the Resources Section of this module.\n\nGo to Resources section.\n\nAn important process commonly associated with the implementation or use of standards is conformity assessment. This is the process of evaluating or measuring whether materials, products, processes, services, systems or persons meet requirements (such as those contained in a standard). ISO and IEC also develop procedures and standards for conformity assessment.\n\nWhat do standards contain?\n\nThe International Standards published by ISO or by IEC are international consensus documents developed by representatives of the ISO or IEC member bodies coming together in international Technical Committees. International Standards contain technical specifications or other precise criteria, which ensure that materials, products, processes, services, systems, or persons are fit for their intended purpose (for more about consensus, see 1.4).\n\nStandards have no predefined lifetime but undergo periodic review to ensure that they take account of the latest technological developments and market trends.\n\nAs noted above, standards do not necessarily just contain requirements (which are specifications, such as defining characteristics, tolerances and limiting values) for products.\n\nThey can also be test methods, codes of practice, management system standards, recommendations, or guidelines (guidance) on an agreed best practice.\n\nManagement system standards describe how businesses internally manage their production and continuous improvement processes, either for quality assurance purposes, or to address specific concerns such as food safety, environmental stewardship or security of information systems.\n\nNational, regional and international standards\n\nThe first thing to remember is that standards usually start at the country level. Most countries have their own national standards-making bodies, and most of these are members of ISO and will have all of the following roles:\n\nthey publish, and may write, their own national standards\n\nthey represent their country in regional and international standard-setting fora\n\nthey hold a reference library of national, regional and international standards\n\nthey sell copies of standards\n\nSome also offer conformity assessment services such as accreditation, certification or other commercial activities\n\nNational standards bodies may also group together to make regional standards. For example, national standards bodies in Europe are also members of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) as well as members of ISO. Together with its sister organizations, CENELEC and ETSI, CEN has a special role to develop European Standards that can support European Union laws (known as âdirectivesâ) or broader European public policies. Other regional standards groups exist as well, such as in Latin America (COPANT), or the Asia-Pacific region (PASC).\n\nThe use of standards may be voluntary, or they may be referenced in regulation (therefore mandatory). The \"New Approach\" in Europe is an example of this (see www.newapproach.org).\n\nStandards are used in Europe to support pan-European legislation under this âNew Approachâ. Standards are mandatory when referenced in specific EU Directives, but otherwise the decision on their use remains voluntary.\n\nUnder the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, governments are required to base their national regulations on standards produced by organizations like ISO and IEC, as much as possible (also see 1.3).\n\nPartly because of these rules, and also because of the general globalization of trade, national and regional standards bodies are either adopting or otherwise using International Standards, where possible.\n\nWhat is ISO?\n\nISO is a network of the national standards bodies (NSBs) of some 164 countries (in 2012), with one member per country. Among other activities, ISO's Central Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, coordinates the organization and development of International Standards.\n\nISO is a non-governmental organization: its members are not, as is the case in the United Nations system, delegations of national governments. Even so, ISO occupies a special position between the public and private sectors. This is because many of its members are part of the governmental structure of their countries, or are mandated by their government. Other members have their roots uniquely in the private sector, having been set up by national partnerships of industry associations, working cooperatively with the public sector.\n\nTherefore, ISO is able to act as a bridging organization. It can develop solutions that meet both the requirements of business and the broader needs of society, including stakeholder groups like consumers and other users.\n\n1.4.2 International Standard\n\nOne essential feature of international standards is that the process is formally laid down in the ISO/IEC Directives (the rules that govern the standards development procedure). All international standards development work must follow this process, which has been established to ensure transparency and fairness. These are two important principles that underpin the credibility of ISO and IEC.\n\nIn ISO (and IEC), a proposal for an International Standard is most usually submitted by an NSB:\n\nto the ISO Central Secretariat for further development, if it is an ISO member\n\nto the IEC Central Office if it is a member of IEC\n\nIn some cases, an NSB can offer a national or regional standard to form the basis of an International Standard (âfast track procedureâ) or as a sample text appended to a New Work Item Proposal (NWIP).\n\nIt can also come from a number of other sources, such as an ISO policy or governing body (e.g. COPOLCO), the ISO Secretary-General, a Technical Committee or an organization in liaison (e.g. OECD or CI).\n\nAn ISO International Standard represents a global consensus on the state of the art in the subject of that standard. This global consensus is reached over the course of a six-stage development process for International Standards, which is described in detail below.\n\nISOâs standards development process is designed to reflect the WTO principles of transparency, openness, impartiality and consensus, effectiveness and relevance, coherence, and addressing developing country concerns, so as to contribute to the credibility of the International Standards produced. For example, the process allows for input and consensus building, first among market players and experts at the drafting stages of the standards, and second among countries at the formal voting stages of the standards. As a result, all ISO International Standards effectively reflect a double level of consensus.\n\nFor more about the process click on this flowchart:\n\nReview of International Standards (Confirmation, Revision, Withdrawal)\n\nAll International Standards are reviewed at least once every five years by all the ISO member bodies. A majority of the P-members of the TC/SC decides whether an International Standard should be confirmed, revised or withdrawn based on a survey circulated to all ISO members about the adoption and use of the standard in question.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the standards development process and ISOâs deliverables, see the ISO brochure âJoining inâ, available free online at: http://www.iso.org/iso/joining_in_2012.pdf.\n\nThe average development time for an International Standard is approximately three years. Increasingly, the work is done electronically to improve speed to market and to conserve resources.\n\nISO also produces other types of documents that involve fewer consultation stages such as international Workshop Agreements (IWA), Technical Reports (TR) (therefore a lower degree of consensus), but are quicker to reach the marketplace.\n\nThe ISO Committee on consumer policy (COPOLCO)\n\nISO seeks to ensure that its standards are market-relevant and meet the needs of the end-user. This end-user is often a consumer who is exposed to an increasingly global offer of products and services. As standardization plays a significant role in assuring that products meet essential consumer requirements for health, safety, and quality for example, standards are a key tool in promoting consumer protection. See Section two for more about how standards benefit consumers.\n\nRealizing that consumers were an important stakeholder in standards development, ISO established a policy development committee in 1978, the Committee on consumer policy (COPOLCO). COPOLCO reports directly to the ISO Council, the governing body of the organization.\n\nCOPOLCO has a membership of some 112 National Standards Bodies from among the ISO membership (as of January 2013), of which approximately three-quarters are from developing countries.\n\nCOPOLCO has the following general objectives:\n\nMaking ISO/COPOLCOâs services available to ISO members worldwide\n\nSupporting the development of consumer participation in standards-making\n\nStudying how consumers can benefit from standardization\n\nPromoting the positive role of standards in consumer protection\n\nEncouraging the exchange of experience on standards work of consumer interest\n\nChannelling consumersâ views both into current standards projects and proposals for new work in areas of interest to consumers\n\nCOPOLCO achieves these objectives by:\n\nCoordinating participation by consumer representatives in selected areas of priority interest to consumers\n\nDeveloping publications to promote consumer participation in standards work and to train consumer representatives for this task\n\nCoordinating training activities and representation at events involving consumers and standardization issues\n\nOrganizing annual workshops that bring together representatives of consumers, public authorities, manufacturers and standardization experts\n\nPreparing a range of Guides for experts, to help them address consumer issues and priorities more adequately when they draft standards\n\nPreparing proposals for new standards projects\n\nInforming consumers and other interested persons through a freely available online newsletter and social media sites\n\nIn relation to standards development at the national level, COPOLCO membership encourages networking. This assists consumer representatives at the national level to benefit from the experiences of consumers in other countries.\n\nFor specific contributions that COPOLCO has made to ISO's work, see section 4.2\n\nSee the dedicated consumer area of ISO Online for more about COPOLCO.\n\nCOPOLCOâs partners\n\nCOPOLCO cooperates closely with several other ISO policy development committees, as \"internal\" partners. The ISO Committee on developing country matters (ISO/DEVCO) concentrates, inter alia, on helping ISO's developing country members build capacity and therefore participate effectively in the ISO system, equally with other countries. COPOLCO and DEVCO work closely together on training workshops to help NSBs and consumer organizations work more effectively together in standards development.\n\nGo to DEVCO website\n\nCOPOLCO also cooperates with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) on matters of common interest, including product recall, market surveillance, and use of marks of conformity assessment.\n\nCOPOLCO works with three external partners (liaisons):\n\nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)âs Committee on consumer policy (OECD/CCP). A number of standardization initiatives from COPOLCO have drawn on the research and studies by the OECD.\n\nGo to OECD (www.oecd.org) website\n\nConsumers International, the worldwide organization for consumer groups. Consumers International is a federation of consumer organizations dedicated to the protection and promotion of consumersâ rights worldwide through empowering national consumer groups and campaigning at the international level. More than 220 organizations, from 115 countries, participate in CI. Note: Many CI members attend the COPOLCO plenary meeting each year as members of the national COPOLCO member delegations.\n\nGo to CI (www.consumersinternational.org) website\n\nInternational Organization for Legal Metrology (OIML) is an intergovernmental treaty organization which promotes the global harmonization of legal metrology procedures. Legal Metrology is the entirety of the legislative, administrative and technical procedures established by, or by reference to public authorities, and implemented on their behalf in order to specify and to ensure, in a regulatory or contractual manner, the appropriate quality and credibility of measurements related to official controls, trade, health, safety and the environment. OIMLâs work has relevance for consumers, inter alia, in the area of calibration for measuring equipment. This is critical for the accuracy of safety tests, and consumer tools such as utility meters. It is also vital for consumer product testing laboratories.\n\nGo to OIML (www.oiml.org) website\n\nThese liaisons participate in COPOLCOâs annual meetings and workshops, and also contribute to the development of COPOLCOâs publications and research.\n\nThe IEC also participates in COPOLCO, as does ANEC, the European consumer voice in standardization.\n\nCOPOLCO also organizes training activities to foster consumer representation in standards development, in partnership with ISO/DEVT, the capacity-building arm of ISOâs Committee on developing country matters (DEVCO). Through the generous support of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, several ISO members and sponsoring organizations, seven regional training events took place in various locations around the world. Following these, there were two âtrain the trainerâ events (one in English, one in French), as well as a number of follow-up workshops which are still continuing. There is now relevant training expertise available in more regions and countries, which can undertake training on consumers and standards. For more information, contact ISO/DEVT (devt@iso.org).\n\nThe presentations and proceedings of all of these workshops are publicly available in a dedicated area of ISO Online.\n\nISO also produces the following helpful materials that are available in the resource section of this module:\n\nSupporting stakeholders â Disseminating ISO Documents to National Mirror Committees (ISO), 2009\n\nThe consumer and standards â Guidance and principles for consumer participation in standards development (ISO), 2003\n\nHow ISO/IEC Guides add value to International Standards (ISO), 2007\n\nMy ISO job â Guidance for delegates and experts (ISO), 2008\n\nGuidance for national standards bodies â Engaging stakeholders and building consensus (ISO), 2010\n\nInvolving consumers â Why and how (ISO), 2011\n\nJoining in â Participation in International Standardization (ISO), 2012"
