        "text": "General Information\n\nInternational Standard Serial Number ( ISSN )\n\nISSN is a worldwide identification code used by publishers, suppliers, libraries, information services, bar coding systems, union catalogues, etc. for citation and retrieval of serials such as Journals, Newspapers, Newsletters, Directories, Yearbooks, Annual Reports & Monograph series, etc. The benefits include international publicity and recognition of the serial by automatic inclusion in the International Serials Directory Database.\n\nThe International Journal of Computer Applications has been the assigned the unique online ISSN 0975-8887.\n\nSerials:\n\nSerials are print or non-print publications issued in parts, usually bearing issue numbers and/or dates. A serial is expected to continue indefinitely. Serials include magazines, newspapers, annuals (such as reports, yearbooks, and directories), journals, memoirs, proceedings, transactions of societies, and monographic series .\n\nISSN:\n\nThe ISSN is the International Standard Serial Number, which allows the identification of serial publications. It’s a standard numeric code made up of 8 digits whose last digit is a control character that may be the letter “X”.\n\nWhy ISSN?\n\nThe ISSN distinguishes a particular serial from others. The ISSN also helps library patrons, libraries, and others who handle large numbers of serials to find and identify titles in automated systems more quickly and easily.\n\nDoes the ISSN Have Any Meaning Embedded in the Number?\n\nUnlike the ISBN, which contains country and publisher prefixes, the ISSN contains no inherent meaning."
