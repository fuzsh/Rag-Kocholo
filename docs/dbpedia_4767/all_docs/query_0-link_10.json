Used by all institutions other than the ISSN Centers when recording the ISSN from an issue or from a bibliography.\n\nOf international interest, thus a full record has been registered with the ISSN Network. Used for all continuing resources for which individual ISSN Centers receive ISSN requests from abstracting and indexing services or other ISSN Network centers. Also used for all other continuing resources that are not within the scope defined for value 1. This value may be input only by the ISSN Centers.\n\nNot of international interest, thus an abbreviated record has been registered with the ISSN Network. Used for continuing resources judged to be of local or ephemeral interest. ISSN Centers have defined publications of local or ephemeral interest as those in which interest is likely to be limited to a certain geographic area, e.g., local newspapers, or certain span of time, e.g., calendars of events. In case of doubt, value 0 is used. This value may only be input by the ISSN Centers."
