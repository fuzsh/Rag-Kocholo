        "text": "The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops standards through over 200 Technical Committees (TC), each representing a specific sector of activity. A major sector in ISO is healthcare technology and the principal TC for dentistry, where FDI provides expertise, is ‘ISO/TC106 (Dentistry)’. Its formal scope is ‘Standardization of terminology, methods of test and specifications applicable to materials, instruments, appliances and equipment used in all branches of dentistry’.\n\nThe International standards that are developed play a significant role in improving the quality of dentistry. With millions of dental products sold worldwide, the development of international dental standards is very important to assure the safety and quality of those products. Dental professionals worldwide use materials, devices, equipment and procedures that are covered by dental international standards."
