Because according to the latest ISO statistics as of October 2020 , ISO has 165 member countries and published 23386 international standards , these are the latest and most accurate numbers and updates. . So what is ISO essentially ? Why do Vietnamese businesses and businesses around the world apply ISO so much? First, let’s go over the basics and primitives of ISO.\n\n1.1.
