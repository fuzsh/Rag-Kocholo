        "text": "It is strongly recommended that publishers use the ISSN number as part of the title-level DOI they use to offer a persistent and resolvable link to their journal.\n\nA DOI is the identifier of an entity—physical, digital or abstract. Its syntax is defined by ISO 26324:2012 Information and documentation – Digital Object Identifier System (DOI). It is composed of a prefix and suffix:\n\nthe DOI prefix is assigned to an organization by a DOI Registration Agency;\n\nthe suffix for a DOI is created by the organization depositing the DOI for a content item in the DOI system.\n\nAmong official DOI registration agencies, CrossRef specializes in scholarly and professional publications and it assigns DOI prefixes to publishers. The latter can thus identify articles or book chapters with DOIs. They are also strongly encouraged to create DOIs for journal titles.\n\nThe ISSN Standard, ISO 3297:2007, provides internationally accepted recommendations to use ISSN as suffix for title-level DOIs: “To construct a DOI suffix using an ISSN, precede the ISSN (including the hyphen) with the lowercase letters “issn” and a period”.\n\nPIE-J: The Presentation & Identification of E-Journals, a NISO recommended practice (NISO RP-16-2013), provides the following example:\n\nTitle : Učenye zapiski universiteta imeni P.F. Lesgafta\n\nISSN : 1994-4683\n\nTitle-level DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5930/issn.1994-4683\n\nPublishers are also encouraged to follow DOI best practices defined by Crossref, notably:"
