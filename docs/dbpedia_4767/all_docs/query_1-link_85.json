The Scientific Journal of Cosmointel has successfully obtained two separate ISSN numbers (for Farsi and English language journals) from the National Library and Archives of Canada, which are listed on the journal’s website. Henceforth, these codes will be displayed on the cover of each publication and as a barcode on the back cover.\n\nNote-2: Therefore, issues without an ISSN are no longer considered valid.\n\n2- DOI (Digital Object Identifier)\n\nThis string of identifiers serves as unique and permanent identification numbers for each article used in scientific journals. By securing official membership in one of the world’s most reputable DOI-issuing agencies (Crossref), the Scientific Journal of Cosmointel has been granted permission to issue DOIs for each article (separately for English and Farsi journals). Consequently, all articles and products on the Scientific Journal of Cosmointel website have been equipped with their respective DOIs (see the archive section). The major benefits of these DOIs are:\n\nUniqueness of each article: These codes are used to identify and differentiate each article from other articles.\n\nDisplaying articles in international scientific databases: These codes facilitate the search and access to articles in scientific databases.\n\nStandard referencing to scientific articles: These codes make citing scientific articles easier and more specialized.\n\nIt is noteworthy that these achievements reflect the Scientific Journal of Cosmointel’s ongoing efforts to provide quality and trustworthy scientific content to academic communities. These official codes will henceforth be used in all our publications and articles. We hope our esteemed readers will make use of them in their citations and bibliographies. In conclusion, we express our heartfelt gratitude to all the contributors of the Scientific Journal of Cosmointel, researchers of Cosmointel Research Institute, editorial and translation teams, etc. for their efforts, which will have lasting impacts on the history of science."
