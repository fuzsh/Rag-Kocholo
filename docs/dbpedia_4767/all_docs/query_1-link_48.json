        "text": "The Scientific and Educational Centre at Scientific Publications – Publ.Science has prepared a new video about ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) and its significance in the academia. This information will be useful for all scientists who are actively interested in scientific publication activities.\n\nPresenter: Yelyzaveta Bataieva – Specialist of the Scientific and Educational Centre\n\nIt is important for every modern researcher to be published in scientific journals that are officially registered and have ISSN (print) and ISSN (online). Publications that do not have this ID may be considered suspicious and will not be indexed in international databases. What is ISSN and what is its role in the scientific process will be considered below.\n\nInternational Standard Serial Number was developed in the 1970s by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to identify the resources of serials in print and electronic format.\n\nISSN National Organizations are located around the world, coordinated by the International Centre located in Paris.\n\nThis network of organizations comprises 90 countries and constantly includes new countries, creating centres that assign ISSN numbers, maintain databases of serials, act as reputable organisations that monitor compliance with all standards, support local ISSN services, help promote it and provide information services.\n\nISSN CAN BE\n\n· Print – for printed publications\n\n· Online – for electronic publications\n\nWHICH PUBLICATIONS DOES ISSN APPLY TO?\n\nnewspapers\n\nperiodicals\n\njournals\n\nwebsites\n\ndatabases\n\nISSN consists of the abbreviation \"ISSN\" and two four-digit groups of numbers, which are separated by a hyphen and look as follows:\n\nNature Journal ISSN 1476-4687\n\nScience Journal ISSN 1095-9203\n\nThe eighth digit is the control digit and is calculated based on the previous seven digits. To avoid possible repetitions, the 8th digit can be written in Roman \"X\" if the result of the digits equals ten.\n\nISSN is provided if the journal has\n\neditorial staff;\n\nspecified editorial responsibility;\n\nresource name;\n\nURL;\n\nsubject-oriented content;\n\naudience.\n\nWHERE IS AN ISSN WRITTEN?\n\nPrinted publication\n\nISSN is usually written on the right side, at the top or on the pages with editorial information (publisher, frequency of publication, etc.).\n\nElectronic publication\n\nISSN is placed on the main page or on the main menu page in any part. It is important that it is easy to read.\n\nIf the publication also has an ISBN (International Standard Book Number), it should also be displayed.\n\nTHE USE OF ISSN IN DOI\n\nThe ISSN is often used as a component of the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) at the header level. Then the quoted articles are much easier to find.\n\nWith ISSN it is easier to find printed material in the library, and with DOI – digital material on the Internet."
