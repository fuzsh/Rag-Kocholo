        "text": "ISO/TS 22943:2022 Information and documentation — Principles of identification\n\nTechnical Committee: ISO/TC 46/SC 9 Identification and description\n\n“This document defines the philosophy of why identifiers exist and why they are valuable for trade and information management. It establishes a core set of relevant characteristics and expectations for identifiers and the general business case of guidelines for identifiers. This document explains the reason identifiers are structured the way they are and for what purpose, while acknowledging other communities define identifiers differently.”\n\nISO/IEC 23053:2022 Framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems Using Machine Learning (ML)\n\nTechnical Committee: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 Artificial intelligence\n\n\"This document establishes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) framework for describing a generic AI system using ML technology. The framework describes the system components and their functions in the AI ecosystem. This document is applicable to all types and sizes of organizations, including public and private companies, government entities, and not-for-profit organizations, that are implementing or using AI systems.\"\n\nISO 3297:2022 Information and documentation — International standard serial number (ISSN)\n\nTechnical Committee : ISO/TC 46/SC 9 Identification and description\n\n“This document defines and promotes the use of a standard code (ISSN) for the unique identification of serials and other continuing resources. Each International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a unique identifier for a serial or other continuing resource in a defined medium whether print or electronic. This document also allows for grouping related continuing resources into clusters identified by a separately-prefixed ISSN as defined in this document. ISSNs are applicable to serials and to other continuing resources, whatever the business model or modes of distribution (e.g. free, open access, on subscription, etc.) and irrespective of whether the serial is currently in publication, has ceased publication, or publication is planned for the foreseeable future. Continuing resources include whatever the medium of production (print or electronic): serials, such as newspapers, periodicals, journals, magazines, blogs, conference proceedings, monographic series with no predetermined conclusion, annual or other periodic reports, and ongoing integrating resources that are updated, such as loose-leaf publications, updating websites, institutional repositories, directories and databases. Monographs, sound and video recordings, notated music publications, audiovisual works, textual works and musical works have their own standard identifiers and are not specifically mentioned in this document. Such items can carry an ISSN in addition to their appropriate identifiers when they are part of a continuing resource. NOTE This document does not contain any operational guidance for its practical implementation.”\n\nISO/TS 8000-82:2022 Data quality — Part 82: Data quality assessment: Creating data rules\n\nTechnical Committee: ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Industrial data\n\n“This document describes how data rules apply to various types of data. Such rules exist to sustain the integrity and reliability of data by capturing requirements into a form that can be processed by databases and other information systems. The following are within the scope of this document: fundamental concepts of data rules; key characteristics of data rules for common types of data, where these types are identifier, currency value, quantity, date or time, rate, free‑text entry, code and key; how data profiling contributes to formulating effective data rules. The following is outside the scope of this document: specific rules for specific sets of data. This document can be used in conjunction with or independently of standards for quality management systems.”\n\nW3C to become a public-interest non-profit organization\n\n“We are pleased to announce today that W3C is to become a public-interest non-profit organization. The design of the new legal entity has been taking several years because of the imperative to preserve the core mission of the Consortium to shepherd the web by developing open standards with contributions from W3C Members, staff, and the international community. In the months leading to the launch of a new legal entity in January 2023, we will release further details. Please find more information in our media advisory about the original Hosted model that is being replaced and what it helped W3C accomplish in 28 years, the reasons for change and why we must preserve our standards development process, and our next steps.”"
