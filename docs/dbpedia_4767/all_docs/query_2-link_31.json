        "text": "One of the ISO objectives is to respond to the requirements of the marketplace. The organization develops standards in response to requests from groups who express a need for help with their activities. This means that, when you order a copy of an ISO standard, it addresses specific business needs directly rather than using a theoretical approach. The quality standards, for example, contain detailed guidelines that allow you to improve the quality of your operations and the products you design and manufacture.\n\nThe ISO technical committees are responsible for developing its standards. These committees are made up of experts from all over the world, and the ISO objective is to distill expert knowledge into standards that you can apply in any country. When you implement an ISO standard, you can be confident that the guidelines represent current expertise. Based on the advice of these experts, the standards define the terms used and the scope of application to facilitate your implementation. To help you further, the ISO publishes examples of successful implementations such as for the standards on energy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nA key objective for the ISO is to develop its standards with the involvement of all interested parties. In addition to the more than 250 technical committees, consumer groups, industry representatives and NGOs can have input. With a broad base contributing concerns, your implementation of an ISO standard is unlikely to run into strong opposition in your own company or locality. ISO standards are designed to guide technical and organizational implementations in a non-controversial manner. This orientation allows you to propose adhering to ISO standards in your company without major controversy.\n\nThe ISO not only welcomes input from all stakeholders but allows such input to influence the standards within their objective of developing guidelines based on consensus. This consensus-based approach promotes widespread acceptance and implementation of ISO standards. When you order and start implementing a standard, such as one on risk management, you can be sure that other companies are using it successfully and, if problems were found, they have been resolved within the consensual model. If you hire a consultant to help with implementation, he usually will be able to give you examples of companies similar to yours in which the ISO standard is already in place."
