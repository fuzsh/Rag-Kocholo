We work with other organizations, such as the IEC and ITU, to create an annual World Standards Day. The day is celebrated by standards organizations around the world and takes a look at how standards address the challenges that face society today. ISO also engages the wider public through our consumer committee on standards development (COPOLCO).\n\nWe promote the teaching of standardization, by participating directly in a joint masters program, helping our members to set up similar programs and by maintaining a database of materials related to standards in education at all levels.\n\nIn addition to raising awareness, we also help our members through training, and act as a resource for standards-related research.\n\nYou can find out more about the ISO strategy by checking out our strategic vision and our annual report, but it all comes down to one thing: serving our members to help achieve the vision of standards used everywhere.\n\nWhat are the different types of ISO membership?\n\nFull members (or member bodies) influence ISO standards development and strategy by participating and voting in ISO technical and policy meetings. Full members sell and adopt ISO International Standards nationally.\n\nCorrespondent members observe the development of ISO standards and strategy by attending ISO technical and policy meetings as observers. Correspondent members that are national entities sell and adopt ISO International Standards nationally. Correspondent members in the territories that are not national entities sell ISO International Standards within their territory.\n\nSubscriber members keep up to date on ISOâ€™s work but cannot participate in it. They do not sell or adopt ISO International Standards nationally."
