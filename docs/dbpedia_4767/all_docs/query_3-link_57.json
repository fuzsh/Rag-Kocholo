        "text": "Why Researchers Choose PLOS ONE\n\nInclusive publication criteria and scope\n\nPLOS ONE accepts research in over two hundred subject areas across science, engineering, medicine, and the related social sciences and humanities. We evaluate research on the basis of scientific validity, strong methodology, and high ethical standards—not perceived significance. Multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research, replication studies, negative and null results are all in scope. We also publish Registered Reports and Protocols.\n\nFair and robust review\n\nPLOS ONE staff and our expert board of Academic Editors work together to ensure that the peer review process is fair, fast and thorough and that the work we publish meets high ethical and methodological standards in line with our editorial policies. We offer our reviewers the opportunity to sign their reviews and authors the choice to publish their Peer Review History supporting transparency, accountability and credit.\n\nReach\n\nResearch published in PLOS ONE is immediately available to the widest possible audience. To help authors broaden their reach both in and outside of their discipline, our dedicated media team works with an extensive network of journalists to highlight noteworthy research. PLOS ONE articles received more than 100,000 mentions in media outlets around the world in 2022.\n\nMulti-disciplinary assessment\n\nWith more than 20,000 new authors joining the PLOS ONE community every year in over 200 research areas, PLOS ONE facilitates connections within and between disciplines\n\nOpenness\n\nThe PLOS ONE community paved the way with open access. Now we’re doing the same with open science.\n\nPLOS applies the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license to works we publish. Under this license, authors retain the copyright to their work and grant permission for anyone, anywhere in the world to read, share, and reuse these articles, as long as the author and original source are properly cited.\n\nThroughout the peer review and publication process, PLOS ONE encourages transparency and practices that increase the visibility, trust, and reuse of research. We offer enhanced author attribution and identification through the CRediT authorship taxonomy and ORCID iD, publicly posted protocols and data sets, facilitated preprint posting, and optional Published Peer Review History.\n\nMeaningful metrics\n\nPLOS promotes the use of individualized article-level metrics to track the impact and reach of your unique work with precision. Every article we publish provides viewership, downloads, media mentions, social sharing, and citations through Altmetric."
