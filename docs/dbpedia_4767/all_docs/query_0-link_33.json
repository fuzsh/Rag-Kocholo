        "text": "Voted CONFIRM on\n\nISO 9707, Information and documentation – Statistics on the production and distribution of books, newspapers, periodicals and electronic publications\n\nDescription:\n\nThis International Standard gives guidance on the keeping of national statistics to provide standardized information on various aspects of the production and distribution of printed, electronic and micro-publications (essentially books, newspapers and periodicals). In addition, this International Standard provides recommendations on subject classification.\n\nVoted APPROVE on ISO/FDIS 26324 Digital Object Identifier System\n\nDescription:\n\nThis document specifies the syntax, description and resolution functional components of the digital object identifier system. It specifies the general principles for the creation, registration and administration of DOI names (where DOI is an initialism for “digital object identifier”).\n\nThis document defines the syntax for a DOI name, which is used for the identification of an object of any material form (digital or physical) or an abstraction (such as a textual work) where there is a functional need to distinguish it from other ojects.\n\nVoted APPROVE with comments on ISO/FDIS 23527 Research Activity Identifier (RAID) Information Technology\n\nQuestion:\n\nQuestion: Do you approve the technical content of ISO/FDIS 23527 for publication?\n\nDescription:\n\nThis document defines the use and structure of the Research Activity Identifier (RAiD) system. The RAiD system includes a registry which supports the identification of research projects, i.e. projects managed in a scholarly or industrial environment which are expected to lead to specified outputs.\n\nIt also specifies the RAiD metadata record which holds key metadata relating to the identified project and indicates relationships to other entities and their persistent identifiers and metadata.\n\nComment:\n\nASIST agrees with the question asked by Access Innovations:\n\nIs there an overall plan for how all these ID’s will work together?\n\nVoted APPROVE with Comments on ISO NP 16687 Impact Assessment for Museums\n\nDescription:\n\nThe proposed International Standard “Impact assessment for museums” is planned as a follow-up to ISO 18641 “Information and documentation – International museum statistics” and ISO 21246 “Information and documentation – Key indicators for museums”. Its purpose is to define and describe methods for assessing and measuring the impact of museums on individuals and on society.\n\nComments:\n\nASIST is of the opinion that the proper course of action would be to modify and combine the existing standards in this area rather than develop an an entirely new standard\n\nVoted APPROVE on ISO FDIS 3297 International Serial Standard Number (ISSN)\n\nQuestion:\n\nQuestion: Do you approve the technical content of ISO/FDIS 3297 for publication\n\nDescription:\n\nThis document defines and promotes the use of a standard code (ISSN) for the unique identification of serials and other continuing resources.\n\nEach International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a unique identifier for a serial or other continuing resource in a defined medium whether print or electronic.\n\nNOTE: This was a minor revision.\n\nVoted APPROVE with comments on ISO/DIS 24229, Codes for written language conversion systems\n\nQuestion:\n\nDo you approve of the technical content of ISO/DIS 24229?\n\nDescription:\n\nThe codes are devised for usage in any application requiring the expression of written language conversion systems, including transliteration and romanization systems, in coded format.\n\nComment:\n\nThe example given included “Varia systems” with “The Wade-Giles Chinese transcription system from A Chinese-English Dictionary” from 1912. This is fine, but maybe there could be another example for the “Pinyin” which has replaced Wade-Giles system by majority of the name authorities and subject headings in the world for years.\n\nComment provided by Marcia Zeng\n\nVoted CONFIRM on ISO 2709:2008, Information and documentation – Format for information exchange\n\nQuestion:\n\nDo you recommend ISO 2709:2008 be confirmed, revised or withdrawn?\n\nDescription:\n\nThis International Standard specifies the requirements for a generalized exchange format which will hold records describing all forms of material capable of bibliographic description as well as other types of records. It does not define the length or the content of individual records and does not assign any meaning to tags, indicators or identifiers, these specifications being the functions of an implementation format.\n\nThis International Standard describes a generalized structure, a framework designed specially for communications between data processing systems and not for use as a processing format within systems."
