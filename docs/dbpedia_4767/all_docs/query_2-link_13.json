        "text": "ISO Definition\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international nongovernmental organization made up of national standards bodies; it develops and publishes a wide range of proprietary, industrial, and commercial standards and is comprised of representatives from various national standards organizations. ISO has a membership of 165 national standards bodies. Source: https://www.iso.org/about-us.html\n\nISO compliance refers to the creation of, and adherence to, policies, processes, and procedures. ISO standards include ISO 9000, ISO 9001, ISO 13485, and ISO 14971.\n\nISO CERTIFICATION PROCESS\n\nISO certification involves having an independent third-party organization provide assurance that a product or service meets the requirements of a particular ISO standard. Although the process will vary based on the type of standard and certifying body, the following steps are required.\n\nImplement a quality management system (QMS)\n\nA QMS provides the framework to help companies carry out processes in a systematic manner. It also provides a roadmap for meeting ISO and other quality standards. The implementation of a QMS typically starts with a companyâ€™s overarching business goals and objectives which translate into policies, processes, and standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n\nAs you develop a QMS, keep these key elements in mind:\n\nQuality policy and objectives\n\nQuality manual\n\nOrganizational structure and responsibilities\n\nInternal processes\n\nCustomer satisfaction\n\nContinuous improvement\n\nDocument control\n\nEnterprise quality management system (eQMS) software\n\nEnterprise cloud-based solutions like Arena QMS connect product and quality records in a single system to help organizations easily manage corrective and preventive actions (CAPAs), customer complaints, SOPs, employee training records, and other processes that are essential for demonstrating compliance with ISO standards.\n\nThe three largest and most well-established such organizations are the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which have each existed for more than 50 years (founded in 1947, 1906, and 1865).\n\n*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org"
