        "text": "La Library of Catalonia Manages the allocation of the ISSN number for serial publications published by companies and entities based in Catalonia since January of 2008, as a result of the transfer of functions and services related to this competition in the Generalitat of Catalonia (Royal Decree 1405 / 2007, of 29 of October of 2007).\n\nAs detailed in its website:\n\nThe ISSN identifies a periodic publication throughout the world, unequivocally and unambiguously.\n\nIt is a basic element in all the processes of information, communication, control and management that refer to these types of publications.\n\nIt constitutes a method of rapid and effective communication between publishers, distributors, booksellers and subscription agencies to ensure, among other steps, the precise and immediate identification in the case of subscription orders.\n\nIt is an ideal base for the construction of the bar codes of the serial publications, which facilitate the commercialization.\n\nIt involves the construction of the ISSN International Database which, with more than one million records and the reliability of the data, constitutes an essential informational resource in regard to serial publications.\n\nFor journals and other periodicals edited by members of the scientific community of the UPC and deposited electronically on the deposit UPCommons, the Intellectual Property Service facilitates the processing through your form\n\nPeople interested in applying for the ISSN for journals not deposited in UPCommons, they can do it for free using the form of the Library of Catalonia, provided that the detailed requirements are taken into account your web. For example, in the case of printed publications, the following information must be taken into account:\n\nBefore applying for the ISSN, you must have obtained the number of Legal Deposit (DL).\n\nWhen submitting the application form, a cover and credits page file must be attached.\n\nThe preferred location for printing the ISSN on a print serial is the top right of the cover, in the format ISSN 0000-0000. Other alternative locations are the header area, the copyright page, or the area where information about the publisher, frequency, and other publication data is given.\n\nThe ISSN will not be valid until a copy of the first issue is sent to ISSN Management service.\n\nIf the publication takes time in the course of publication, a copy of the first issue and also a newer one must be attached."
