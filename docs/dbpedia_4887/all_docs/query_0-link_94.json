        "text": "State Attorney General Martha Coakley\n\nView Slide Show\n\nNorth Adams - Those elected in November to shape policy and make history were welcomed to the city today by Mayor John Barrett III, the state's longest-serving elected mayor.\n\nAmong the political powerhouses were Gov. Deval Patrick, Lt. Gov. Tim Murray, and a hometown girl who insisted that she be sworn into office from her native community.\n\nFLASH VIDEOS\n\n•Swearing in of State Attorney Martha Coakley\n\n•Speech of State Attorney Martha Coakley\n\nCoakley Takes Oath Of Office\n\n<L2>City native and Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley was given the Oath of Office at a Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art-hosted ceremony that began at 11 a.m..\n\nCoakley is a 1971 graduate of Drury High School and a 1975 graduate of Williams College. Prior to election as attorney general, Coakley was district attorney for Middlesex County.\n\nShe was sworn to the post as the state's top legal advocate by state Supreme Court Assistant Justice Francis X. Spina.\n\nCoakley was given a standing ovation.\n\nDuring her remarks, Coakley thanked the standing-room only crowd for their support.\n\n\"I am delighted to be here and see all of you here this morning,\" she said. \"It means a lot to me.\"\n\nScores of hometown folk came to show their pride in Coakley. The event was also attended by members of the Berkshire region legislative delegation, municipal police and fire chiefs, public safety officials, mayors, and other elected officials and dignitaries.\n\nCity Mayor John Barrett III presided over the ceremony.<R3>\n\nCoakley thanked Murray for attending the ceremony and noted that the event was serving to \"show the rest of the state that there is life west of Boston.\"\n\n\"I am proud to be able to make my first public comments here at MASS MoCA,\" she said.\n\nThose who spoke before Coakley recounted anecdotes and shared memories. Retired Drury High School teacher Donald Pecor recalled Coakley as a very intelligent student whose cultural awareness surpassed his own and whose sense of humor popped up in research papers.\n\n\"I remember a research paper she brought to class titled 'Everything You Wanted To Know About Calvin Coolidge But Were Afraid to Ask,'\" Pecor said, and later added, \"She knew more about Broadway plays than I did.\"\n\n<L4>Additional recollections included Coakley's early education at the former St. Joseph's parochial school, and her role in a first-grade parade.\n\nPeople's Gateway\n\nCoakley shared memories of her own.\n\nPecor was just beginning his education career when Coakley attended his class room, she said. During one particular day, he became so frustrated with the students that he was about to storm out of the classroom, she said.\n\n\"He snapped his briefcase shut and attempted to leave the room,\" she recalled. \"But he had caught his tie in his briefcase.\"\n\nCoakley spoke about her parents Ed and Phyllis Coakley and the family home on Highland Avenue. The city provided a wonderful education for a budding attorney, she said.\n\n\"I learned how to debate in this city,\" she said. \"And I learned how to ski. It's no exaggeration to say that you can take the girl out of the Berkshires but you can't take the Berkshires out of the girl.\"\n\nThe region offers opportunities in education and recreation, she said, and noted that the Hoosac Tunnel was once well-recognized as the \"Gateway To The West.\" The Berkshire region served as her personal gateway, she said, and then emphasized that she sought election as state attorney general so that she deliver positive change to the lives and futures of state residents. She applauded the work of predecessors Thomas Reilly and Scott Harshbarger, and said she will focus on issues including consumer fraud, consumer rights, homeland security, public health, and public safety.\n\n\"Our law office will and should serve as the people's gateway, where rights are protected, where justice is enforced, where a level playing field is valued, and where fairness extends to all regardless of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.\"<R5>\n\nDaughters Of North Adams\n\nDuring his remarks, Barrett termed the day a historic occasion during which \"a daughter of North Adams came home to share this special day with us.\"\n\nBarrett noted that Coakley and former acting Gov. Jane Swift received education within the city's public education system and were raised in a city that values family and community. Coakley and Swift learned\n\n\"not from master educators but from the people of this city,\" he said.\n\n\"[Coakley] returns home to a city that taught so much about life and the struggles so many people face,\" Barrett said.\n\n\"You come from good stock,\" Barrett said to Coakley. \"And the people of North Adams are the salt of the earth.\"\n\nSwift shares a friendship with Coakley and spoke during the ceremony.\n\nSwift listed the region's educational and cultural entities and acknowledged the area's abundance of natural resources. Those who live in the Berkshire region want the same things as their Boston counterparts swift said, and noted the needs for good schools, a strong infrastructure, a solid economy and affordable housing. To achieve these goals, good people must lead the quest, she said.\n\n\"We are proud that one of our native daughters has accepted the challenge,\" Swift said of Coakley.\n\nWilliams College trustee Michael B. Keating shared the college's pride in Coakley, and reminded the crowd that Coakley is a member of the first Williams graduating class that admitted women students as freshmen.\n\nThe ceremony procession was led by Berkshire Sheriff Carmen C. Massimiamo Jr. The North Adams Police department Color Guard led Coakley and other dignitaries to a stage at MASS MoCA, and Morgan Leveque led the Pledge of Allegiance. The Drury High School chorus sang the National Anthem.\n\nThe invocation and benediction was given by the Rev. Jerome Joseph O'Day, O.S.B., who is the pastor of the Saint Raphael the Archangel Parish in Manchester, N.H..\n\nFormer Central Berkshire Registrar of Deeds Mary K. O'Brien also offered remarks during the ceremony.\n\nThe recessional included music by the Drury High School brass quartet and the high school jazz band.\n\nMASS MoCA's morning began with another distinguished and honored guest; Gov. Deval Patrick toured the museum led by museum executive Director Joseph C. Thompson after an 8:30 meeting with Barrett. The meeting in Barrett's office was attended by state Rep. Daniel E. Bosley, state Sen. Benjamin Downing, Berkshire District Attorney David Capeless, and others, who accompanied Patrick on the museum tour.\n\nGreenfield Mayor Christine Forgey and Pittsfield Mayor James Ruberto joined the tour and were among those who attended Coakley's swearing-in ceremony."
