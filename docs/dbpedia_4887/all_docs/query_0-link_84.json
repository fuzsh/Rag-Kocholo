        "text": "TAUNTON — Massachusetts Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley said on Saturday that she supports Taunton State Hospital and keeping the facility open for mental health care in the future.\n\nCoakley made the comment during a campaign stop in Taunton to rally supporters during her run to become the next governor of Massachusetts.\n\nCoakley said she disagrees with how Gov. Deval Patrick has worked to cut funding for the mental health facility in Taunton, but that she supports Patrick’s efforts to increase access to drug abuse treatment in the state.\n\n“I know there are a lot of concerns here about keeping Taunton State open,” Coakley said. “I would like to be able to find the resources and intend to keep it open, and look at — not just here, but in other parts of the state — increasing our capacity for beds for people with mental illness. … This has got to be a priority and we know that if we don’t have investment in that, we’ll pay for it some place else.”\n\nFor the third straight year, the state is proposing to move all inpatient beds from Taunton State Hospital to the new Worcester Recovery Center. In each of the past two years, the state faced staunch local opposition and a compromise was reached in the Legislature allowing 45 beds to remain at Taunton State, which used to have approximately 170.\n\n“I don’t think we should be cutting, I think we should be adding,” Coakley said.\n\nCoakley said she supports Patrick’s recent announcement declaring a public health crisis related to the opiate abuse epidemic, with a $20 million expansion in drug abuse treatment services and other measures.\n\n“It’s a good first step,” she said. “We need to do more.”\n\nSince the beginning of the year, there have been 9 overdose deaths in Taunton and more than 130 total overdoses reported by the Taunton Police Department.\n\nCoakley said that the public health angle is just as important as the law enforcement approach to dealing with the heroin and pharmaceutical opiate abuse epidemic that is taking place.\n\n“We have to get this very dangerous drug off the streets,” said Coakley, referring to heroin, which local police said has been tainted recently with the painkiller fentanyl. “We have to look at ways in which we get people before they get hooked onto drugs in other programs or ways in which we can prevent it. … There is not enough beds and access. I hope the Governor’s response will help us do that part for communities like Taunton that are so hard hit.”\n\nCoakley also said she supports South Coast Rail, a proposed $2.2 million project that would bring commuter rail services from Boston, to Taunton, Fall River and New Bedford.\n\n“One thing I’m very interested in is turning around the economy for everybody, not just Wall Street,” Coakley said. “I also think it’s really important we work with local cities towns and regions to develop in a way that they want to. … I think more than that they want to see some growth, jobs and workforce development.”"
