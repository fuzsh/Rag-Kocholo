        "text": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) is joining CBS News as a political contributor, according to a network announcement on Friday.\n\nPatrick, 63, served as governor from 2007 to 2015. There was some speculation that he would run for president in 2016, but he decided against it.\n\n{mosads}”In office, he made education, innovation and infrastructure the centerpiece of his recovery strategy after the Great Recession, implementing significant reforms, driving record-breaking growth and opportunity, and achieving nation-leading results,” reads the CBS announcement.\n\n“Before entering politics, he was a senior executive and general counsel in two Fortune 500 companies, a member of other large and small company boards, and a partner in two Boston-based business law firms. Early in his career, he was an attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, where he focused on death penalty appeals and voting rights cases,” the release added.\n\nPatrick is currently a managing director and co-managing partner of Bain Capital Double Impact, a company that was co-founded by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), a former Massachusetts governor and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe news comes one day after CBS News announced it signed former Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign manager Robby Mook and Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) 2016 campaign manager Terry Sullivan as contributors."
