        "text": "In an interview that aired on television this morning, Treasurer Steven Grossman knocked Attorney General Martha Coakley’s recent comments that two scandals that unfolded on Governor Deval Patrick’s watch might not have happened if she had been governor. Grossman called her comments “foolish,” lacking in sophistication, and having a “certain sense of political overstatement that is inappropriate.”\n\nGrossman, who public polls have found to be trailing Coakley by a wide margin in the race for Democratic nomination for governor, has been ramping up efforts to draw a contrast with her in recent weeks, as the Sept. 9 primary election nears.\n\n“To suggest that none of these things would have happened on her watch, I think betrays a level of just lack of sophistication,” Grossman said in the interview with Jon Keller on WBZ-TV’s “Keller at Large.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with the Lowell Sun editorial board on July 7, Coakley indicated that as governor, she would provide better oversight of state agencies.\n\n“I don’t think under a Governor Coakley you would have an Annie Dookhan,” she told the editorial board, referring to the disgraced former state chemist, who pleaded guilty last year to widespread tampering with drug evidence, jeopardizing tens of thousands of cases over several years.\n\n“I don’t think under a Governor Coakley you would have a New England Compounding,” she said, referring to the state-regulated compounding pharmacy, now defunct, that manufactured tainted drugs blamed for killing 64 people and sickening hundreds more in 2012.\n\nThe next day Patrick pushed back against her comments.\n\n“When Martha Coakley is governor, I hope for her the good fortune of not having anyone commit a crime on her watch,” Patrick told FOX 25 on Tuesday. “And I also hope that if they do, or something else goes wrong, she deals with it as forthrightly as we have in this administration.”\n\nAsked if he took them as a slight on his management style, Patrick said he wasn’t worried about the comments or “any of the other foolish things that sometimes get said by candidates during campaigns.”\n\nGrossman, as he has in other recent interviews, lauded Patrick generally on WBZ-TV, while lightly taking issue with a few actions of the governor’s administration. Grossman noted the troubled implementation of medical marijuana in the state as well as repeating criticisms of the state for awarding a no-bid contract in its effort to fix Massachusetts’ dysfunctional online health insurance marketplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroadly though, the treasurer said Patrick will be remembered for guiding the economy through tough times and laying a foundation for future.\n\nPatrick, who is nearing the end of his second term in office and is not running for re-election, remains quite popular with voters, public polls have found.\n\nDonald M. Berwick, a former federal Medicare and Medicaid chief, is the third Democrat vying for his party’s gubernatorial nomination. Also running to succeed Patrick are two Republicans and three independent candidates.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email\n\nJoshua Miller can be reached at joshua.miller@globe.com.
