        "text": "BOSTON — It was a cringe-worthy moment for Massachusetts Democrats.\n\nMartha Coakley, who was running in 2010 for the Senate seat long held by Edward M. Kennedy, spoke dismissively of the campaign ritual of shaking hands with voters at their beloved Fenway Park. That moment came to epitomize all that critics said was wrong with her candidacy, and she went on to lose the race, turning over “Teddy’s seat” to Scott P. Brown, a Republican.\n\nThis year, she is running for governor. And after her announcement tour in September last year, a chastened Ms. Coakley made a campaign stop at Fenway. She shook hands, chatted with fans and posed for photographs, hoping to signal that she would run a better campaign this time around.\n\nOn Saturday, she will face her first big political test since 2010, when 6,000 Democratic activists meet at the state party convention in Worcester to endorse a candidate for governor.\n\nMs. Coakley, 60, the state’s attorney general since 2007, holds a substantial lead in polls of voters, running way ahead of her four rivals.\n\nBut in an unusual dynamic, she appears not to have won over party insiders. Indications are that despite her popularity with voters, Ms. Coakley will not win her party’s endorsement. The endorsement will almost certainly go to Steve Grossman, 68, the state treasurer, who lags far behind her in the public opinion polls.\n\nAnalysts explain the situation this way: Ms. Coakley leads among voters in part because she has the highest name recognition. And she lags among party activists because of their lingering concern from 2010 that she will not be able to fire up the troops sufficiently to keep the governor’s office in Democratic hands. (Gov. Deval Patrick is not seeking a third term.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
