Ed Markey (D-MA), the Dean of the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation, released the following statement on the election of Deval Patrick to be governor of Massachusetts:\n\n“Tonight Massachusetts has fired another ‘shot heard round the world.’ The voters have elected Deval Patrick as the first African American governor of our Commonwealth, and Massachusetts has become the second state in the nation to ever elect an African American governor. Breaking down barriers and building bridges is what Deval does best; and we all are grateful to him and excited beyond words for his governorship.”"
