        "text": "BOSTON — Lessons learned from their unsuccessful campaigns in 2010 will serve Martha Coakley and Charlie Baker well as they vie for the governor's office, according to two political strategists very familiar with Beacon Hill.\n\nFormer Republican Gov. William Weld and former Democratic U.S. Sen. Mo Cowan, once a top adviser to Gov. Deval Patrick, got together Tuesday to discuss the upcoming election. Both now work at ML Strategies, a government relations consulting firm.\n\nCoakley and Baker each won their party primaries and will face off in the race for governor along with independents Evan Falchuk, Jeff McCormick and Scott Lively.\n\nUnity in the Democratic party after a tough three-way primary battle will be key for Coakley, Weld and Cowan explained.\n\n\"In order for Martha Coakley the attorney general to become Martha Coakley the governor, that coalition must be tight, it must be strong, the Democratic party must appeal to its base, it must speak to its values and it must continue the grass-roots strategy that Democrats have shown has great success over past few electoral cycles,\" Cowan said.\n\nWeld recalled when Baker worked in his administration in the 1990s. He said the Republican candidate must show voters \"the real Charlie Baker.\"\n\n\"In the case of Charlie Baker, I think the dangers are issues dangers, getting successfully painted as an ally of the Republican national party in Washington on certain social issues,\" Weld said. \"Economic justice, income inequality, earned sick leave. Those issues resonate in this state, and God forbid you get painted on the wrong side of them between now and Nov. 4.\"\n\nBefore the primary elections, there was some debate in the Baker camp over which Democrat would provide the toughest competition. Conventional wisdom dictated that the frontrunner Coakley posed a bigger challenge but some Baker advisors thought state Treasurer Steve Grossman would be a tougher adversary, Weld said.\n\nThe thinking was that Grossman, like Baker, has a record of creating jobs in the private sector and could have potentially neutralized Baker on a major talking point, Weld explained.\n\n\"Steve ran a hell of a campaign,\" he said.\n\nWhile Cowan downplayed suggestions of cracks within the Democratic electorate following the primary, Weld said they could be real.\n\nDuring the primary campaign, Coakley prominently ran on her record as attorney general, Cowan said. Baker, meanwhile, was in a much less competitive primary race and had more opportunities to speak about the future rather than the past.\n\nBeing able to hit general election talking points earlier, Cowan said, gives Baker a bit of an edge.\n\n\"Martha Coakley is at a point where she needs to articulate clearly and concisely her plan to govern over the next four years,\" he said.\n\nThe former senator also predicts that each candidate's management experience will be a major campaign issue. Coakley is the current attorney general, while Baker served in the Weld and Cellucci administrations and is a former CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.\n\nOne of the issues in this campaign will be about the role of management in large government and corporations.\n\n\"I look forward to that debate, how they both frame their public leadership roles,\" Cowan said."
