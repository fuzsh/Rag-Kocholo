        "text": "Former longtime Milton resident and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is joining the 2020 presidential race.\n\n\"In a spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American Dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\" Patrick said in a video on his official website.\n\nThe 63-year-old Democrat will kick off his campaign today in New Hampshire.\n\nA native of Chicago’s South Side, Patrick has solid ties to the South Shore. He graduated from Milton Academy in 1974 and served on the school’s board of trustees. The Patricks moved into their former home at 75 Hinckley Road in Milton in 1989 and sold the six-bedroom Colonial for $1.2 million in 2016.\n\nSince leaving office in 2015, he has been a managing director at Bain Capital, the private-equity firm that became a target for Democrats in 2012 when Obama was running against Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee who co-founded the firm.\n\nPatrick spent several months in 2018 considering a presidential bid, but ultimately decided not to run, citing \"the cruelty of our elections process\" and its effect on his family.\n\nOne of the reasons Patrick initially decided not to run was the strain it would put on his family.\n\n\"The process is cruel,\" he told Boston public radio station WBUR last year. \"Every family has its warts, has its issues . . . has things they'd rather keep private, and we do as well.\"\n\nHis wife, Diane, was hospitalized for depression after a bruising and racially divisive 2006 gubernatorial campaign. She was also diagnosed last year with Stage 1 uterine cancer but now has a good prognosis. His two daughters, both in their early 30s, were also opposed to the race, but are now said to be more amenable.\n\nPatrick has political strengths and an ability to deliver such soaring oratory that President Barack Obama was accused of taking lines from him from a 2006 speech. Patrick became a two-term governor using an uplifting life story and an aspirational political brand, traits that his allies say could serve him well in a presidential campaign.\n\nPatrick was Massachusetts governor from 2007 to 2015.\n\nMaterial from The Washington Post was used in this report."
