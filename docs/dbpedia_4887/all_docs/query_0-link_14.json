        "text": "Martha Coakley, whose defeat as the Democratic candidate for the Senate in 2010 led to the election of Scott P. Brown and threatened President Obama’s health care bill, announced Monday that she was running for governor in 2014. Chastened by her loss, Ms. Coakley, the state’s attorney general, has said she has learned from her mistakes. The race has drawn four other Democrats. In a video announcing her candidacy, she is shown talking with voters, suggesting a more personable campaign than the one she conducted in 2010 and one with a strong populist pitch. She also planned a three-day announcement swing to 18 cities. Gov. Deval Patrick is stepping down."
