        "text": "Deval Patrick, who made history after becoming Massachusetts’ first black governor, threw his name into the 2020 Democratic presidential election Thursday.\n\nIn a video released Thursday morning, Patrick, 63, played up his poor upbringing on the South Side of Chicago and traced his journey to the \"American dream,\" the path to which is \"closing off,\" he said.\n\n\"I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field. They bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,\" he said. \"But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country.\"\n\nPatrick made a passing reference to President Donald Trump but did not mention him by name. The election, he said, is \"about more than removing an unpopular and divisive leader\" but about \"delivering instead for you.\"\n\nElection 2020: In California's 2020 primary, Latino voters could help Democrats defeat President Trump\n\nPatrick is a close ally of former President Barack Obama and had explored a bid for the presidency before deciding not to run.\n\nIn August 2018, allies of Patrick launched a political action committee called Reason to Believe, and Patrick spent time ahead of the 2018 midterms stumping for Democratic candidates.\n\nBut in December, Patrick took his name out of the running, citing “the cruelty of our elections process.”\n\n\"I’ve been overwhelmed by advice and encouragement from people from all over the country, known and unknown. Humbled, in fact,\" Patrick said in a statement posted to Facebook at the time. \"But knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom (my wife) and I love, but who hadn’t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask.\"\n\nPatrick's decision reflects uncertainty from some about the direction of the Democratic presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden entered the race as the front-runner and maintains significant support from black voters, whose backing is crucial in a Democratic primary. But he’s facing spirited challenges from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, progressives whose calls for fundamental economic change have alarmed moderates and wealthy donors.\n\nYoung voters: Can they again push Democrats to victory in 2020?\n\nPatrick’s candidacy faces a significant hurdle to raise enormous amounts of money quickly and to build an organization in the traditional early voting states that most of his rivals have focused on for the past year. And he’ll have to pivot to the expensive and logistically daunting Super Tuesday contests, when voters in more than a dozen states and territories head to the polls.\n\nPatrick graduated from Harvard Law School and later went on to be part of President Bill Clinton’s administration as chief of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.\n\nPatrick is not the only moderate Democrat who is seeking a late entry into the 2020 race. Michael Bloomberg is also weighing a bid, billing himself as a more centrist alternative who could beat Trump.\n\nBecause of his late bid in the race, Patrick will likely not make the debate stage in December, where he will need at least 200,000 unique contributors and at least 4% in four national or early state polls, or at least 6% in two early state polls.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat will likely benefit from his state’s proximity to New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press"
