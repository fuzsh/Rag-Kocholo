        "text": "MANCHESTER, N.H. — New England states have not voted for a Republican for president in years, even spurning one of their own, Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, in 2012.\n\nBut in Tuesday’s midterm elections, New England, long considered a bastion of liberalism, proved friendly territory for Republicans. The region’s all-Democratic House delegations will have two Republican members, one from New Hampshire and one from Maine.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, the Republican nominee for governor, inched past Martha Coakley, the Democrat, who conceded on Wednesday.\n\nIn Vermont, the Republican Scott Milne came out of nowhere and nearly toppled Gov. Peter Shumlin, who, because of a quirk of Vermont law, will have to be formally named governor by the Legislature because he did not get 50 percent of the vote."
