        "text": "Voters elected Republican Charlie Baker in part as a demand for a strong manager on Beacon Hill — where scandal after high-profile scandal plagued Gov. Deval Patrick’s administration and tainted Democrat Martha Coakley’s failed campaign.\n\n“I think Charlie Baker suddenly portrayed the race as Patrick’s third term, asking voters if they want more of the same,” said Thomas Whalen, political historian at Boston University, who pointed to ongoing problems at the Department of Children and Families as well as the failed Health Connector website that’s cost taxpayers more than $500 million.\n\n“He was able to hang those around Martha Coakley’s neck,” Whalen said. Coakley tried to distance herself from the DCF scandals and the administration’s botched rollout of medical marijuana dispensaries during numerous debates. “She needed her own message, not Patrick’s.”\n\nPatrick waited for months before he finally accepted the resignation of embattled former DCF head Olga Roche, who was on duty when 5-year-old Jeremiah Oliver was killed. He then posted former Registry of Motor Vehicles chief of staff Erin Deveney to head the department.\n\n“I think the scandals and mismanagement in certain parts of the state government under Deval Patrick provided a foundation for voters to embrace a good manager like Charlie Baker,” said Republican consultant Rob Gray. “The problems in state government heighten his appeal as a manager and as somebody who would check the Democratic Legislature.”\n\nPatrick’s job approval numbers and his popularity remained sky-high, however, despite the nonstop political fires during his tenure, said Suffolk University pollster David Paleologos.\n\n“For an incumbent that’s been peppered with negative stories, he’s been valuable to her,” he said.\n\nPatrick leaned on his popularity and campaigned heavily for Coakley, but she still didn’t win by a high enough margin in Boston, Worcester and Springfield.\n\n“She didn’t pull out enough votes in the Democratic triangle, and he could have helped her with that,” said Paleologos, who added that much of the blame falls on Coakley as a candidate. Attorney General-elect Maura Healey, who fended off a Republican rival, also received help from Patrick but won by 81 percent in Boston, compared to Coakley’s 66 percent win.\n\n“She just underperformed,” Paleologos said."
