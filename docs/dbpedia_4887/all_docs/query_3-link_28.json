        "text": "071414 deval patrick.JPG\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick proposed cuts across state government, including to local aid, in order to fill an anticipated $329 million shortfall in the budget.\n\n(JIM COLE / ASSOCIATED PRESS FILE)\n\nBOSTON - On Jan. 8, the day Republican Charlie Baker is sworn in as the Massachusetts governor, Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick and his wife, Diane, are planning to leave for \"a long, warm weather nap,\" Patrick said Monday.\n\nAfter eight years in the spotlight, Patrick will be enjoying his vacation as a private citizen. Ask him where he's going and he says only, \"away.\"\n\n\"Its time,\" Patrick said of his impending departure from office. \"Eight years of missing dinner with your wife and occasions with your kids is probably plenty.\"\n\nPatrick leaves office after his second term – he declined to seek a third – as a generally popular governor. He enjoys a close relationship with President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Guessing where Patrick goes from here – and whether he will seek office again - has become a parlor game among Beacon Hill's chattering class.\n\nPatrick is currently talking to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about an affiliation with the school's \"Innovation Initiative,\" which describes itself as an program that will use MIT's resources to promote innovative ways to solve worldwide problems.\n\nPatrick, in an interview with The Republican/MassLive.com, described that affiliation as \"loose at best.\" Patrick said he anticipates looking for work in the private sector, focused mostly on business rather than academia.\n\nBefore becoming governor, Patrick, an attorney, worked as general counsel and a senior executive for Texaco and Coca-Cola. Before that, he worked as a lawyer for the NAACP and in private practice. In 1994, Democratic President Bill Clinton appointed him assistant attorney general for civil rights.\n\nPatrick campaigned for Obama nationally during the last election and has made political trips around the country. His national profile has led to speculation that Patrick will run for president one day, though Patrick has said he will not run in 2016.\n\nAsked what role he plans to play in national politics after leaving office, Patrick said he may have \"some\" role, depending what others ask of him. But, he said, \"I'm not looking to be a pundit.\" Patrick made clear that he is not ruling out a run for office in the future – even though he is not thinking about it now.\n\n\"I care about national policy and policy-making and that good people get in, and maybe one day there will be another opportunity for me to do something,\" Patrick said.\n\nPatrick said he does not know what office he would seek, but he said, \"The governor's role is really, really special because you get to set the agenda, and once you've driven the bus, its hard to just be on it.\"\n\nCould he run for president one day? The answer is not no.\n\n\"It's not in my plan,\" Patrick said. \"I am humbled as a kid from the south side of Chicago that so many people from so many stations in life around the country have asked me to think about it. But it's really too soon for me to be thinking about it.\"\n\nPatrick said he campaigned for Obama because Obama is his friend and is \"a once in a generation leader.\" \"I believed in his candidacy and I believe in his presidency,\" Patrick said.\n\n\"These jobs are lonely, by the way,\" Patrick added. \"So if you have someone who really does believe in what you're trying to do and is not trying to get something from it, a job in the cabinet or what have you, I think you want to stay close. I think he's wanted me to stay close, and I've wanted to stay close.\"\n\nThere is no traditional path for former Massachusetts governors. Republican Mitt Romney and Democrat Michael Dukakis both ran for president, received their party's nominations, then lost. Dukakis ended up in academia, as a political science professor at Northeastern University. Romney, a former venture capitalist, is rumored to be considering a third presidential run.\n\nAmong other recent ex-governors, Republican William Weld tried unsuccessfully to use the governorship as a launching pad for other offices – U.S. senator, ambassador to Mexico and New York governor. He worked in law and private equity and wrote novels. He returned to Massachusetts in 2012 to work at the law firm Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo and at the firm's government relations and consulting unit, ML Strategies. He recently registered as a lobbyist.\n\nRepublican Paul Cellucci served as ambassador to Canada then worked as a lawyer. Republican Jane Swift moved into educational technology and is now CEO of Middlebury Interactive Languages, which runs online and in-person courses for language learning.\n\n\"These are high achieving people. They've got to stay busy,\" said Mo Cunningham, associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Cunningham said Patrick is an \"ambitious guy\" and predicted that he will run for president one day, after he returns to business and earns some money.\n\nThomas Whalen, a political historian and associate professor of social science at Boston University, said former Massachusetts governors have worked in academia, business and government, or have retired. Whalen said the speculation about Patrick has likely been fueled by the governor's smoothness in front of the media and his charismatic personality.\n\n\"If you watch him do a media interview, presidents can only hope to be that smooth,\" Whalen said.\n\nWhalen suggested that Patrick may be hoping for a selection as vice president in 2016 or an appointment as a Supreme Court justice. Whalen speculated that if Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination for president, Patrick's selection as vice president could help turn out African American voters and energize the team that worked on behalf of Obama in the last two presidential elections."
