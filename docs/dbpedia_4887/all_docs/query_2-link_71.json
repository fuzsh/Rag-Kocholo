        "text": "Join us for an exclusive conversation with Gov. Deval Patrick, distinguished professor of practice and co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School and former governor of the commonwealth of Massachusetts. This fireside chat is offered through the Dean’s Speaker Series, hosted by the Kenan Institute in partnership with UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School Dean Mary Margaret Frank.\n\nThe event will take place at 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday, April 23, in the Kenan Center Dining Room.\n\nThe discussion promises a thorough look at leadership in times of crisis and volatility, Gov. Patrick’s remarkable leadership journey and his pioneering work in impact investing.\n\nGov. Patrick’s career includes significant roles in law, business and public service. He became the first African American governor of Massachusetts when elected in 2006 to the office, which he held until 2015. Beyond his time in government, he has led in the field of impact investing, aiming to achieve both financial return and positive social impact.\n\nGov. Patrick will share insights on the resilience and vision required to lead through uncertain times. His cross-sector experience in navigating both the corridors of power and the fields of impact investing offers valuable lessons for leaders aiming to make a difference in today’s complex world. A question-and-answer session will allow attendees to engage with him directly.\n\nThe event is free and open to the public, but pre-registration is required. A reception with hors d’oeuvres will follow at 6:15 in the Kenan Lounge."
