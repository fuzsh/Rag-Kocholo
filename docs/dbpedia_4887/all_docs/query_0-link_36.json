        "text": "FALL RIVER — Martha Coakley, the attorney general and Democratic candidate for governor, continued on the campaign trail on a drizzly Sunday at the St. Michael Parish feast.\n\nShe answered questions about the Market Basket employee standoff, gun control and how she’ll advocate for South Coast Rail to benefit this region between sharing chourico sandwiches with Mayor Will Flanagan and pulling buttery dough from a large vat to be formed and deep-fried for popular malassadas.\n\n“It kind of puts us on the map,” Michael Aguiar, president of the feast, said of Coakley’s appearance. Coakley arrived shortly before the procession was slated to begin, from Everett to North Main streets and back to the church.\n\nOn the last day of the three-day festival that’s been tradition since 1978, Aguiar said, “So far everything’s gone well, except for the bad weather yesterday.”\n\n“This is the best part, to hear the music and sample the food,” said Coakley, who was game for trying a few ethic dishes Flanagan suggested.\n\n“We’re honored and proud to have Martha be part of the tradition,” said Flanagan, who endorsed Coakley less than two weeks ago, while touting her experience.\n\nA bit earlier, she greeted guests nearby at a Highland Avenue coffee shop.\n\nShe said several people asked her about the $2.3 billion South Coast Rail project, which is a long way from full funding.\n\n“That’s going to be a top priority for me,” Coakley said. The project is one that Gov. Deval Patrick has pushed along during his tenure.\n\nShe cited planning, permitting and background work that’s been accomplished, stating, “I think we’re on the way.”\n\nShe said in meetings with legislators and Flanagan she believes the mega-rail project is “one thing” among others to improve the waterfront and the economic outlook in Fall River and New Bedford, which was her next stop Sunday.\n\nCoakley mentioned the importance of improved funding for education, and when asked defended her record toward gun control as attorney general.\n\nShe said she supported the legislation for better background checks by police chiefs.\n\n“I’m always going to put my resources into legislation and policies,” she said, “to keep guns out of the state and out of the hands of people who are unstable.”\n\nShe said more needs to be done on the federal level to ban assault weapons.\n\nRegarding Market Basket, where the board of directors ousted Chief Executive Officer Arthur T. Demoulas and two executives in late June, Coakley said she and New Hampshire’s attorney general in the states where the chain operates remain concerned about workers’ rights.\n\nThe situation has become increasingly unstable after 2,000 employees rallied and eight workers were fired two weeks ago. It’s led to food shelves being poorly stocked, depleted sales and the new executives ordering workers back to work by today or risking losing their jobs, according to published reports.\n\nCoakley said she believes protesting workers “took a big risk,” adding, “I do hope the Market Basket employers and workers can come to a resolution.”\n\nShe said with loyal workers and customers, she hoped “common sense will prevail.”\n\nIn her race against Democratic Treasurer Steven Grossman and former pediatrician and CEO Don Berwick, she called it “yesterday’s news” that recent polls show her 25 percent ahead of Grossman and Berwick garnering just 5 percent from would-be voters.\n\n“Nobody knows that better than I do,” she said, a reference to being ahead and heavily favored against Republican Scott Brown for Senate in 2010, to fill the remainder of a term left by the death of Ted Kennedy. Coakley lost that race to Brown.\n\nIf she were to win the Sept. 9 primary and face Republican Charlie Baker, whom she leads in a recent Boston Globe poll by a few percentage points, “we believe it’s going to be a tough fight,” Coakley said.\n\nIn the meantime, when leaving St. Michael Parish Feast she was off to New Bedford and Whitman, then Boston for a Puerto Rican festival."
