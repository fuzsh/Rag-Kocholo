        "text": "REGION — Democratic candidate for governor and current Attorney General Martha Coakley addressed the North Central Massachusetts Chamber of Commerce Friday morning, outlining her plan to move Massachusetts forward through the changing economy.\n\n“Massachusetts has a bright future,” she said. “But we have a lot of work to do.”\n\nWhile speaking to the chamber, small business remained a focus – a topic Ms. Coakley described as both integral and personal, as her father was an entrepreneur in the North Adams area.\n\n“The strength in our community comes from our small businesses,” Ms. Coakley said.\n\nFor Ms. Coakley, the key to growing a strong economy is focusing on each region’s strengths and opportunities for growth while creating a skilled and competitive workforce.\n\n“We can grow fast, but we’ll collapse,” she stated. “We need to build and grow a healthy economy. Let’s get the basis for that foundation.”\n\nThat foundation, according to Ms. Coakley, is dependent on the state’s schools and in connecting education with future jobs. By aligning their curriculum with sectors growing on a national and global scale and by connecting colleges with job creators, Ms. Coakley explained that businesses can get the workers they need and students will have more employment opportunities.\n\n“We are ahead of other states, because we have such a good educational system,” said Ms. Coakley. “But as we compete for global business, we need to make sure our kids have global skills.”\n\nAmong global skills, Ms. Coakley cited computer science as an area she’d like to see schools focus on, while still remembering conventional education.\n\n“Twenty-five years ago is the Internet anniversary,” she said. “Everything in the future is going to depend on being able to understand computer science. Not just working a cell phone, but understanding code.”\n\n“Let’s use that technology, with good teachers, to give kids the best education available,” she added.\n\nWith recent talks of raising the minimum wage, business owners and members of the chamber expressed concern over how they would navigate the increase, especially where some participate in co-operative programs or employ developmentally disabled workers who may lose their benefits. Ms. Coakley said that the state would need to examine the impact the raise would have on small businesses, and that the general target was employees who work for multinational corporations while supporting a family.\n\n“We should look at ways the state can keep the burden off you and make sure those people stay employed,” Ms. Coakley said.\n\nShe then added that a large portion of the people in the Commonwealth already earn more than the minimum wage and that the extra money on every paycheck would go right back into the economy.\n\nIn her second term as Attorney General, Ms. Coakley said the decision to run for governor was a difficult one and that she learned a tough lesson after losing the U.S. Senate race to Scott Brown in 2010 about the importance of being out and accessible to voters. She was elected Attorney General in 2007 after serving as the Middlesex District Attorney for eight years.\n\nOverall, she explained that her campaign is focused on looking towards the future and making sure everyone has the opportunity to be involved in the economy.\n\n“I believe this state has a great basis to move forward with a strong foundation and a good economy – not just for the people at the top, but for everybody, and frankly not just for Boston but for all of Massachusetts,” she said.\n\nMs. Coakley spoke as part of the chamber’s Good Morning Breakfast series, hosted at the Double Tree Hotel in Leominster.\n\nShe was the third gubernatorial candidate to appear at a breakfast event – Democrat Steve Grossman was invited as guest speaker in November and Republican Charlie Baker visited in January.\n\nThe election to replace Governor Deval Patrick will take place on Nov. 4."
