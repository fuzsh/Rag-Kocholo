        "text": "People have been speculating about Deval Patrick’s real motives for as long as he has been in politics. I certainly have: When I first met him in 2005, I was convinced that his long-shot campaign for Massachusetts governor was really just a profile-raising exercise for a later Senate campaign.\n\nOver years of covering him since, I have seen, and taken part in, speculation that Mr. Patrick wanted to be attorney general, Supreme Court justice, vice president, ambassador and president. I have studied his proposals, tracked his travel and gossiped with his associates in efforts to divine the secret strategies at work.\n\nThis week, as the governor began an 11th-hour presidential campaign, my analysis ends in the same place it always does: There’s no secret. When Mr. Patrick feels that he has something important to contribute, he says so.\n\nIn 2005, he believed that Massachusetts needed to shake off the cautious skepticism that had led to 16 years of Republican governors elected to temper a Democratic-led legislature. Mr. Patrick offered himself as an optimistic, ambitious leader, rallying people to believe that their government could do great things.\n\nToday, looking at the national picture, he views himself as the cure for a Democratic Party struggling to respond to a divisive Republican president. As he sees them, there are presidential candidates who retreat in timidity, others who respond with divisiveness in kind, and those whose calculated attempts at inspiration have fallen flat with voters.\n\nHe sees himself as the only one who can present genuine, optimistic leadership to lead the party — and the country — forward to a post-Trump era.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
