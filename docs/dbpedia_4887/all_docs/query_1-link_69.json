        "text": "Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley is proposing an overhaul of the state’s embattled Department of Children and Families, even as the agency was hit with new charges it was slow to respond to school officials pushing for help to rescue endangered children — including a child who was being sexually assaulted.\n\n“What I’ve proposed … addresses the future issues we see coming up time and time again: too many caseloads, children who fall through the cracks,” Coakley told the Herald of her plan to create a Child Protection Division inside DCF, which has come under fire after a Fitchburg boy it was supposed to protect went missing and is now feared dead.\n\n“I’ve seen it historically, we’ve seen these kinds of issues plague the child welfare system. … I’ve seen different commissioners struggle with this,” Coakley added, saying she would have created the plan even if the case of 5-year-old Jeremiah Oliver of Fitchburg hadn’t come to light. “I think this breaks it apart, makes it clearer.”\n\nCoakley, one of five Democrats seeking her party’s nomination for governor, proposed splitting the agency’s dual mandates of protecting children and keeping together families. She would create an investigative unit focused entirely on probing cases of at-risk children while allowing other social workers to continue to deal with families.\n\nShe unveiled the plan just as state officials scrambled to respond to a letter from Northbridge school officials, who accused DCF of ignoring repeated alarms about threatened children overseen by its Whitinsville office.\n\nIn one instance, Northbridge educators said they had to file 13 “51A” reports — alleging sexual abuse of a child — before a second-grader was removed from the home. School officials also accused DCF of closing cases because parents refused to cooperate, not following up on a child who had missed school for weeks, and not checking on a homeless student.\n\nA defensive Gov. Deval Patrick said he hadn’t been briefed on a meeting DCF Commissioner Olga Roche had scheduled with school brass, but didn’t immediately call for action either, saying that every “real incident” should be taken seriously.\n\n“I don’t diminish any of them,” he said of problems plaguing DCF. “There’s going to be lots of issues raised and there have been lots of issues raised, not all of which are based on fact.\n\n“I think it’s important not to jump to conclusions,” Patrick added. “They have an enormously difficult job. They perform miracles every day, hundreds and hundreds of miracles that don’t get the attention of all of you here, but do earn, I believe, the respect of the public, certainly of mine.”\n\nNorthbridge Superintendent Nancy Spitulnik, who penned the initial letter to Roche, called yesterday’s meeting “productive” and said the district will have ongoing “roundtable” conferences with DCF brass. The letter was first reported by the Worcester Telegram & Gazette.\n\nCoakley, while noting she didn’t know the specifics of the Northbridge case, said her plan could help untie the red tape school officials say bogged down their concerns.\n\n“When those complaints come in, it’s not that there’s 13, or 12 or two, what (matters) is what is the nature of it and does it suggest a pattern?” Coakley said.\n\nUnder her plan, Coakley would keep DCF’s current process of screening abuse claims, but transfer those for children “at risk of continued abuse and neglect” to the new unit. Meanwhile, different social workers would work with the family, helping the new division keep a “singular focus on the welfare” of the child.\n\n— Chris Cassidy contributed to this report."
