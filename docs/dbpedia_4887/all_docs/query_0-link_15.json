        "text": "UPDATED: January 13, 2015, at 10:54 p.m.\n\nOutgoing Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, whose electoral career was suspended by her loss to Republican Charlie D. Baker ’79 in last fall’s gubernatorial election, may take a short-term fellowship at Harvard, according to a report in The Boston Globe.\n\nOn Dec. 22, Coakley, a Democrat, filed a disclosure with the State Ethics Commission, in which she said she was under consideration for a “short-term fellowship position” at an unspecified university in Massachusetts.\n\n“I would assume the new position after I leave office,” she wrote in the disclosure.\n\nThe Globe, citing anonymous “people familiar with the plan” as sources, reported Monday that the school was Harvard.\n\nSpokespeople from Coakley’s press office and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government declined to confirm that Harvard is considering hiring Coakley as a fellow. University spokesperson Jeff Neal also declined to comment on the matter.\n\nCoakley has served two terms as the state attorney general since her 2006 election. In 2010, after losing to Republican Scott Brown in a race for a seat in the U.S. Senate, Coakley handily won reelection as attorney general.\n\nDeval L. Patrick ’78, who preceded Baker as governor, will be joining MIT as a visiting fellow this spring."
