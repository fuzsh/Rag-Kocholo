        "text": "Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Charlie Baker will face off in November's election for Massachusetts governor. Both candidates beat out challengers in Tuesday's primaries.\n\nBaker defeated Tea-Party candidate Mark Fisher. Coakley, the commonwealth's attorney general, beat out Treasurer Steve Grossman and former Medicare and Medicare administrator Don Berwick.\n\nBaker, the former CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, will head to his second straight general election seeking the governor's seat. Baker lost to Democratic Governor Deval Patrick in 2010 by six percentage points, 42 to 48 respectively. Patrick is not seeking a third term this November.\n\nCoakley is looking to recover from a surprising loss to Republican Scott Brown in a 2010 special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Ted Kennedy.\n\nIndependents Evan Falchuk, Jeff McCormick and Scott Lively have also qualified for November's ballot."
