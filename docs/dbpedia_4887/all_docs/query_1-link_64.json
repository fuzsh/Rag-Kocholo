        "text": "BOSTON — When Scott P. Brown won an upset victory in last year’s special election for the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s seat, it seemed his tenure could be brief. Massachusetts is a left-leaning state, after all, where larger-than-life Democrats have run for president or become Washington power players.\n\nBut with a marquee Senate race in 2012, no high-profile Democrat has yet emerged to take on Mr. Brown, the lone Republican in the state’s Congressional delegation and one of the most popular leaders in Massachusetts. Obvious heavy hitters like Gov. Deval Patrick and Mr. Kennedy’s widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, have ruled out running.\n\nNational Democrats are so worried that they have begun recruiting Elizabeth Warren for the seat; she is the Harvard professor struggling to win confirmation to the new federal consumer financial protection agency. But some Democrats here openly wonder whether an Ivy League academic could beat an incumbent admired for his common-man persona.\n\n“Right now, I don’t think we have the candidate who can show me and others they can win,” Mayor Thomas M. Menino said Friday, adding that Mr. Brown has “somehow continued the magic” with voters.\n\nSo what is going on with Massachusetts? Could the state that produced such emblematic liberals as Tip O’Neill, Michael Dukakis and the Kennedy clan have run out of Democrats with star power? Has a Republican whose life story includes posing nude for Cosmopolitan magazine become such a formidable politician that he could be re-elected with no serious competition?\n\nThe Kennedy family’s long prominence in Massachusetts politics may help explain the deficit of high-profile candidates; Mr. Kennedy was in the Senate for nearly 50 years, and the expectation was that other family members would always be ready to step up. Looking toward 2012, some voters are feeling jilted.\n\n“Kennedy was in for so long and his illness was not expected,” said Jerry Schumacher, 74, a lifelong Democrat from Wellesley who was visiting the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on Friday. “He hadn’t groomed anyone and the party hadn’t groomed anyone.”\n\nSome Democratic strategists are more optimistic, pointing out that the Senate contest will take place in a presidential election year, in a state that tends to solidly support Democratic presidential candidates. President Obama won Massachusetts by 26 percentage points in 2008 and remains popular here.\n\nThus far, Democrats who have entered the race — including Setti Warren, the mayor of Newton; Bob Massie, a former candidate for lieutenant governor; and Alan Khazei, a founder of a national service program — are barely known. A few House Democrats, including Representatives Michael E. Capuano and Stephen F. Lynch, have expressed mild interest but are lying low so far. Mr. Menino, a Democrat first elected in 1993, said the lack of compelling candidates was partly because of a transformation under way in the state’s Democratic Party that began when Mr. Kennedy died.\n\n“Teddy used to bring people together in the Democratic Party like nobody else could,” he said. “That’s what we’re missing — we need that unifier who can bring people together, who people respect.”\n\nHe added, “We’re still waiting for that next great leader.”\n\nOn Thursday, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told reporters that party leaders were talking to “a number” of potential candidates for the race and expected to have “a good strong candidate within weeks.”\n\nMatt Canter, a spokesman for the committee, said voters should be focusing on Mr. Brown’s record, saying, “Scott Brown is voting in lockstep with Republicans and already demonstrating exactly why he is wrong for Massachusetts.”\n\nHis record is actually more complicated; while he often votes along party lines, he has gone the opposite way on several occasions, including Wednesday’s vote on a contentious bill that would reshape Medicare. Mr. Brown was one of four in his party to vote against it, reflecting the cautious line he walks as a Republican in a Democratic state.\n\nMr. Brown also voted with Democrats to repeal the ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military, and on last year’s financial regulation bill. Critics paint him as a finger-to-the-wind politician — to their glee, he appeared to indicate support for the Medicare plan before coming out against it last week — but it is unclear whether that will hurt him with voters.\n\n“When he casts these types of votes he makes himself more appealing to the vast majority of Massachusetts voters,” said Peter Ubertaccio, a political science professor at Stonehill College. “He makes it very difficult for the Democratic Party in the state to land a punch.”\n\nDan Payne, a longtime Democratic media consultant, pointed out that Massachusetts is not as monolithically liberal as outsiders believe. The state voted twice for Ronald Reagan, and thanks largely to support from independent voters in the suburbs, it was led by Republican governors for 16 straight years, until Mr. Patrick broke the streak with his 2006 landslide election.\n\n“They like the idea of having what they perceive to be an independent Republican,” Mr. Payne said.\n\nMr. Brown, who defeated the well-known state attorney general, Martha Coakley, to win the Senate seat, has already raised more than $8 million for next year’s race and has tested some campaign themes. In a commencement address at Lasell College this month, he criticized the “go-along-to-get-along attitude that deeply saturates the one-party control of government in this state.”\n\nSome theorize that Mr. Capuano and other House members will forgo a costly campaign against Mr. Brown in hopes that Senator John Kerry will become secretary of state in a second Obama term, thus creating an open seat in 2013 that would be easier to win.\n\n“If you’re a member of the delegation,” said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic political consultant, “maybe you’re saying, ‘You know what, I can get another swing at this and I don’t have to give anything up.’ ”\n\nOthers said candidates who seemingly have no shot can become heavy hitters almost overnight, as Mr. Brown, formerly a little-known state senator, did last year.\n\nAs for “legacy politicians” like the Kennedys, Mr. Dukakis and Mr. O’Neill, Ms. Marsh said any Democrat who could defeat Mr. Brown would become one.\n\n“If you beat Scott Brown,” she said, “you have a legacy.”"
