        "text": "BOSTON (AP) — The three Democrats whose names will appear on the primary ballot for governor disagreed on several issues Wednesday during their first debate since the state party convention, including single-payer health care and gun purchases.\n\nState Treasurer Steven Grossman, Attorney General Martha Coakley and former federal health care administrator Don Berwick participated in the one-hour meeting at the WBUR-FM studios. Convention delegates eliminated two other Democratic hopefuls over the weekend, setting the stage for the three-way Sept. 9 primary.\n\nThe question of whether Massachusetts should adopt a government-funded health care system, often referred to as a single-payer approach, drew one of the debate’s sharpest exchanges.\n\n“I’m prepared to lead a conversation around this state, as governor, on single-payer insurance,” Grossman said. “Fundamentally, we’ve got to take a look at a different model.”\n\nBerwick, who has proposed extending the government’s Medicare program to cover all residents, criticized Grossman for not making a firmer commitment.\n\n“I don’t think single-payer health care is something for discussion. It’s something that needs to happen,” Berwick said.\n\nGrossman asked Berwick how he could implement single-payer without first building a consensus among lawmakers, activists and others.\n\n“Nobody can wave a magic wand, Don. You can’t do that. This is not a monarchy,” Grossman said.\n\n“You need to lead to the change,” Berwick responded. “A discussion is not a goal, Steve.”\n\nCoakley had the last word, saying that Massachusetts was not ready to move to a single-payer system and that it could endanger the high quality of health care in the state.\n\n“I don’t want to sacrifice that by snapping our fingers and saying, ‘We’re going to single payer,’” she said.\n\nAll three said they supported — and, as governor, would sign — a wide-ranging gun control bill recently proposed by House Speaker Robert DeLeo.\n\nBut Grossman and Berwick said the bill should go further and include Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick’s proposal to limit individuals to the purchase of one gun per month.\n\n“Unless you are trying to arm a militia, I don’t think you need to buy more than one gun a month,” said Grossman, adding that he didn’t understand why Coakley wouldn’t support the proposal.\n\n“I guess I don’t understand why you don’t understand Steve,” the attorney general shot back. Boasting that she had earned a grade of “F’’ from the National Rifle Association, Coakley said the one-gun-a-month limit wasn’t necessary in Massachusetts and the legislation should focus on illegal guns and keeping firearms away from mentally unstable people.\n\nAmong other topics the candidates were asked about was whether they supported a full-fledged drive to bring the 2024 Summer Olympics to Boston. Coakley simply replied “yes,” while Grossman and Berwick said they wanted more assurances that an Olympic bid would not divert taxpayers’ money from more important causes.\n\nRepublicans Charlie Baker and Mark Fisher are seeking their party’s nomination in the September primary.\n\nPatrick is not seeking a third term."
