And they bring all of their candidates, successful and unsuccessful together and the party celebrates its political efforts.\n\nWhat there was this morning was a unity event for Martha Coakley. It was really important to her and to the Democratic Party to bring in Elizabeth Warren and Governor Deval Patrick, who planned to meet Wednesday afternoon with Governor-elect Charlie Baker.\n\nThis is a speech Martha Coakley could not have given this way last night.\n\nShe could not have given the thoughtful presentation she gave in which she moved to inspire women, called herself one of the winners, talked about the other people in the party, and her goals in the future.\n\nShe got, in her last look, a very good look."
