        "text": "CHICAGO – Governor Pat Quinn today was joined by Chicago Alderman Pat Dowell to announce an honorary street named for Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, an Illinois native. The street - Wabash at the intersection of 53rd Street – is near where Governor Patrick grew up and has been unveiled as “Honorary Gov. Deval Patrick Ave.”\n\n“I am honored to welcome my friend, Governor Patrick, back home and to present him with this symbol of our gratitude for his dedication to public service,” Governor Quinn said. “Governor Patrick’s roots are right here in Illinois and we are proud of him and what he has accomplished. Honorary Governor Deval Patrick Avenue will stand as a reminder to the community of where life can take you and the importance of giving back.”\n\n“The efforts of Governor Quinn and Alderman Dowell to rename this portion of Wabash Avenue are extremely humbling,” Governor Patrick said. “Hope is a tangible thing. This only matters if it can inspire the children along Wabash Avenue to imagine their own possibilities if they work hard and hope for the best.”\n\nGovernor Patrick grew up in the Robert Taylor Homes on the south side of Chicago and attended Terrell Elementary School at 54th and State Streets. At the age of 14, Governor Patrick moved to Massachusetts to attend Milton Academy and was the first of his family to attend college at Harvard University. Governor Patrick is also a graduate of Harvard Law School.\n\n\"Governor Deval Patrick is a son of Bronzeville. The people of Bronzeville and the 3rd Ward of Chicago are proud of him and his accomplishments. His story inspires us all,\" Alderman Dowell said. \"Governor Deval Patrick Avenue will serve as a daily reminder that your life can take you from Wabash Avenue and 53rd Street to the Governor’s Mansion.\"\n\nGovernor Patrick’s life has charted a path from the South Side of Chicago to the U.S. Justice Department, Fortune 500 boardrooms, and now the Massachusetts State House. In each of these capacities, Governor Patrick has been guided by the advice of his grandmother - hope for the best and work for it. Governor Patrick was first elected as Massachusetts governor in 2006 on a platform of hope and change, and is currently serving his second term."
