        "text": "Mass. Gov.-elect Deval Patrick has appointed WPI President Dennis Berkey to serve as co-chairman of the pre-K-12 Education working group as part of the Patrick Transition Committee. Berkey’s panel is one of 15 that will shape the new gubernatorial administration’s policy agenda as Patrick prepares to take office in January. The working groups will conduct a series of Community Meetings across the state to seek public input.\n\nContact:\n\nRichard Chacon\n\nLibby DeVecchi\n\n617-367-2006\n\npress@devalpatrick.com\n\nBoston, Mass. - Governor-elect Deval Patrick and Lieutenant Governor-elect Tim Murray announced today the creation of 15 Transition Committee issues working groups that will help shape the new administration’s policy agenda as it prepares to take office on Jan. 4, 2007.\n\nContinuing in their grassroots outreach, Patrick and Murray also announced that the working groups would conduct a series of Community Meetings across the Commonwealth over the next several weeks to seek public input for their agenda.\n\n\"During the campaign, Tim Murray and I made it very clear that we will be seeking good ideas from Democrats, Republicans, Independents and anyone else, and we will listen to those ideas and pick the best ones to help move our Commonwealth forward. These Community meetings are the first step in the process,\" said Patrick.\n\nThe meetings will be convened by the co-chairs of the working groups and will include the members of those groups and will be open to the public. The findings from each working group will be filed as a report and delivered to the Governor- and Lt. Governor-elect by December 15th.\n\nFor residents unable to attend the public meetings, each group will be reviewing ideas submitted via the Patrick/Murray Transition Committee website. Final reports will be closely examined by Patrick and Murray as they shape their priorities for the Administration.\n\n\"This series of Community Meetings is just the beginning of our effort to bring people back into civic life, to re-engage their interest and to get some fresh, new ideas about how we tackle challenges and take advantage of opportunities,\" Patrick added.\n\nThe Patrick/Murray Transition Committee today also announced the appointments of two new Deputy Chiefs of Staff, David M. Simas and Brendan Ryan. Simas and Ryan will report directly to Chief of Staff Joan Wallace-Benjamin in the Patrick Administration.\n\nSimas, a life-long resident of Taunton, Massachusetts is a 1992 graduate of Stonehill College and a 1995 graduate of Boston College Law School. Previous to taking the post as Deputy Chief of Staff in the Patrick Administration, Simas served on the Taunton School Committee, the Taunton City Council, worked as Deputy General Counsel to the Massachusetts House of Representatives Post Audit and Oversight Bureau, and aided the Mayor of Taunton as a Special Policy Advisor.\n\n\"I am honored to have this opportunity to serve,\" said Simas. \"I believe that my experience at the local, county and state levels will assist the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor to view the operations of state government from varied perspectives.\"\n\nBrendan Ryan, a native of Foxborough, worked for the Patrick campaign as Deputy Finance Director and later as Trip Director and Chief Aide to the Candidate. Ryan is a graduate of St. Sebastian’s School and Vanderbilt University and worked previously as a reporter for the Gardner News.\n\n\"I am honored and excited to be a part of the Governor-elect’s office. With the leadership of the Governor and Lt. Governor, we have an incredible opportunity to deliver real change.\"\n\nCo-chairs and members of the Transition Committee working groups include:\n\nBudget and Finance\n\nChair, Steven Crosby, Dean, McCormick Graduate School of Policy Studies UMASS-Boston\n\nChair, Michael J.
