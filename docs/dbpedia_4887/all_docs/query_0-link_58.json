        "text": "Martha Coakley acts like a different candidate than she did in 2010. Always considered well-informed and well-versed on the issues, she's now a little more glib, a little chattier, a little more engaging and comfortable when on the stump.\n\nShe wears brighter colors and her bracelets jingle as she gesticulates when she speaks. At times, there's fire in her eyes, not the deer-in-the-headlights look of four-and-a-half years ago.\n\nOnly time will tell whether it makes a difference.\n\nAttorney General Coakley is the clear front-runner in the Democratic field to succeed outgoing Gov. Deval Patrick. Although she finished second in balloting at the state Democratic convention last month and only narrowly avoided a third-place finish, she's remained comfortably ahead of primary rivals Steven Grossman and Donald Berwick in all the polls. And a poll for National Public Radio's WBUR in Boston last week gave her a 13-point lead over Republican favorite Charlie Baker.\n\nIt's a status that should make her both comfortable and a little uneasy as she heads toward the Sept. 9 primary and Nov. 4 general election.\n\nCoakley was in a similar position in 2010 before her bid to succeed the late Edward (Ted) Kennedy in the U.S. Senate went suddenly and dramatically wrong. After a 19-point primary victory and a double-digit lead over Republican Scott Brown in the polls, her campaign collapsed.\n\n\"I lost it,\" she said while answering questions from The Standard-Times Editorial Board last week. \"I acknowledge that. It was awful. There are still people who will never forgive me. I know that.\"\n\n\"Nobody knew that Ted Kennedy was going to die,\" Coakley said in recapping the 2010 collapse. \"That was a horrible loss for everybody. His seat was open. I decided to jump in. No one had time to prepare for that. We had a tough primary. I won by 19 points. It was a short period of time from Dec. 9 to Jan. 19. We were out of money. Everybody kind of said, 'Hey, you're all set because Massachusetts is a Democratic state.\"\n\nBut \"a couple of things were going on. People didn't like Obamacare. People across the country were angry. I don't think people had a chance to see me, to meet me one on one, to know who I was or what I was all about.\n\n\"By the time people were able to recognize that Scott Brown and Republicans were gaining this much momentum, we were not able to turn that around, and we lost.\"\n\nBut she didn't quit, easily winning re-election as attorney general later in 2010 and again in 2012.\n\n\"I faced the issue of 2010 head on,\" she said. \"You learn from the things you don't succeed in as well as the things you do succeed in.\"\n\nAnd now, in her first bid for governor, she's getting back to campaign basics.\n\nIn September, Coakley made New Bedford one of six stops to announce her candidacy, all unscripted meet-and-greets designed to talk to voters one on one, chatting with patrons at Cafe Arpeggio, the Green Bean and the New Bedford Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"In running for governor, my intention is to go all over the state and actually talk to people,\" she said at the time. \"I have some ideas but I want to hear what people say.\n\n\"We have already kicked off a campaign that says to people that I'm going to be out every day shaking hands with people, but more than that, I want to know what their concerns are.\"\n\nNow, Coakley said she's lived up to that. \"We've worked literally every day — well, not Christmas — since September, which we didn't get to do in 2010. We've outraised everybody in every month since September, although we don't have the most money in the bank. In volunteer numbers, we've got the most doors knocked, over 20,000.\"\n\n\"We're building a grassroots campaign (like the kind) that helped Deval Patrick get elected and that helped Elizabeth Warren get elected\" to the Senate over the incumbent Brown in 2012. \"We've got a lot of energy in the race, despite what people in the press say.\"\n\nIn trying to determine whom to vote for in the upcoming elections, Coakley said, \"People should look not just at what we say but our track records as well. That's what you do moving forward in this state. Let's look at the problems we have. Let's look at everybody's track record.\n\n\"I think my record shows that I bring good people into my administration ... to be a problem solver. I believe I can be the best governor because of what I've done and my willingness to move to the governor's office and do that.\n\n\"I know what we need to do, from my time as a district attorney and attorney general,\" Coakley said. \"I know what we need to do to make every tax dollar count. And I know how to make the case to people in Massachusetts that, if we want to move forward and have a good economy and jobs, we need to invest in education.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old, who was born in Pittsfield, raised in North Adams and now lives in Medford, said she has no higher ambition than the corner office in the Statehouse.\n\n\"This is my last job,\" she said. \"I promise.\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview last week with members of The Standard-Times Editorial board, Attorney General and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley was asked where she stands on issues directly affecting SouthCoast. Here's a sampling of her answers:\n\nECONOMY\n\n“It's time for Massachusetts to move ahead on our terms.\n\n“I think we have a bunch of microeconomies around the state and I think our best chance to move ahead, to develop economies that are sustainable, that people want, is to work regionally not just with our elected officials but with our businesses, our advocacy groups in workforce training (and) education. ... You all know what you need in different regions. You're the best place to start (getting ideas to develop the economy).\n\n“Wall Street took our money, gambled it and lost it. Well, Wall Street is doing pretty well again, but the rest of us are struggling, particularly in the Gateway Cities.”\n\nSOUTHCOAST RAIL\n\n“I'm committed to it. I know how to get it done and I know how to get it done on budget.\n\n“One of the things I've committed to is that we keep it on budget and we keep it on time.\n\n“The cost is pretty reasonable in terms of an investment.\n\n“It doesn't begin and end with South Coast Rail. It's what goes up around it. We need to work with communities on what else they need.”\n\nEDUCATION\n\n(State funding for education is) “unfair in ways that are completely random. I am a big believer in one thing that the state needs to do is be fairer to the Gateway Cities in making sure that our educational needs are being met.\n\n“We have to invest in people. They have a right to get on that economic ladder. We have to give breaks to people in the middle class struggling to send their kids to college.\n\n“I think we've gone somewhat down the wrong path in teaching to the test. We have totally lost our way with kids who are just learning how to do testing.\n\n“We should be taking the lessons, the hands-on learning from voc-tech schools and putting them in other schools. What is the application? Why am I learning this?\n\n(Using technology is) “not a fad, but a way to get every kid in the classroom involved in more active learning, to learn how to learn.\n\n“We need to be teaching kids (music and art), the stuff that will keep them engaged. If we don't give kids that opportunity in schools, then who's going to be the patrons of the arts in the future?”\n\nCASINO GAMBLING\n\n“I have said I will not vote to repeal it. I think we've gone down this road. I think we've put some safeguards in, but my heart will not be broken if it's repealed.\n\n“I never thought it was the first place we should go for economic development (but) having no more than three (casinos) and having them be destinations made some sense. And, with the local option, the statute is working the way it's supposed to.\n\nFISHING\n\n“My concern about NOAA is overzealous enforcement ... but not really paying enough attention to the impact those regulations are going to have on fishing families.\n\n“The federal government has said, 'Too bad, we're just going to worry about the fish. We're not going to worry about (fishermen).\n\n“The relief should come from the federal budget, I think. I think the state could look at ways that, if families aren't going to be able to continue to fish, that we provide other ways in which we can soften the blow.\n\nRAISING TAXES\n\n“We're going to come in halfway through a budget. My first priority will be to look at what do our revenues look like, how much has the economy turned around (and) where do we get more efficient in terms of what we do with government ... of making sure taxpayer dollars are going where they should go.\n\n“And then we look at what do we need to do and where do those revenues come from. And if we need to go to people, I think you have to make the case first that this is an investment. You can't just open a budget and say, 'We need to raise taxes.'”\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\n“It's what we see with the achievement gap in schools. It's what we see with income inequality. We have health care disparities in our poorer neighborhoods.\n\n“We're moving away from fee for services to more community health care and prevention.\n\n“Environmental health issues have to be the next great place we go.”"
