        "text": "WHO HE IS ...\n\nWhen Milton resident Deval Patrick announced he was running for governor in 2006, many in his hometown said, “Deval who?” The Chicago native and Milton Academy graduate had run President Bill Clinton’s Justice Department civil rights division, then worked as legal counsel and an executive for Texaco and Coca-Cola. But his initial low profile was no obstacle. In 2006 he defeated Republican Kerry Healey and Independent Christy Mihos to become the state’s first Africa-American governor. In 2010 won re-election against Charlie Baker and Tim Cahill, the former state treasurer from Quincy.\n\nLAST WE HEARD ...\n\nIn 2009 Patrick was seen as a possible pick to be President Barack Obama’s attorney general, but that never materialized. Soon after he left office, in January 2015, Patrick took a lucrative consulting job with the Boston 2024 Olympic Committee, but he dropped it amid critical news reports. He was the 2015 commencement speaker at Harvard University and in 2016 was on Hillary Clinton’s list of possible running mates.\n\nWHAT’S HAPPENING NOW ...\n\nPatrick is now a managing director for Bain Capital, the investment firm founded by former Gov. Mitt Romney. He’s also senior adviser to the Chicago Police Accountability Task Force. He and his wife Diane Patrick sold their Hinckley Road home in Milton in the summer of 2016. Days after Donald Trump’s unexpected presidential victory, Patrick sent out a long email to friends and associates, and said he would “stay woke” to the challenges ahead. This week he told the Senate Judiciary Committee he opposes Trump’s pick of Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general."
