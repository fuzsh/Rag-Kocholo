        "text": "Former rivals Gov. Deval Patrick and governor-elect Charlie Baker met for more than 45 minutes today to talk shop — and then downplayed any political awkwardness in the Corner Office hand-off from a Democrat to a Republican, a transition both promised will be smooth.\n\n“Campaign’s over,” Patrick told reporters when asked of the tenor of meeting, after a sometimes acrimonious gubernatorial race where Patrick, in stumping for Democrat Martha Coakley, slammed Baker for flip-flopping on issues. Baker in turn leveled scathing critiques of Patrick’s management, promising to clean up state government.\n\nToday, however, they shook hands, smiled and joked.\n\n“We’re looking ahead. We’re both looking ahead,” said Patrick, who bested Baker in a bitter 2010 campaign to win re-election. “It’s really important for the commonwealth and the people that we serve … that this be a serious and thoughtful and helpful transition. I want Charlie to succeed.”\n\nPatrick has designated a team to coordinate Baker’s transition, setting aside two rooms on the first floor of the State House for the Republican’s staff and, with today’s traditional meeting, starting a dialogue of how to hand off the reins of state government before Patrick’s second term ends in January.\n\nBaker promised to continue at least one tradition of regularly meeting with the Senate President and Speaker of the House. He also said that while he hasn’t thought for “two seconds” of his raising the governor’s $151,800 salary, he will take one as the state’s CEO, unlike Mitt Romney, who held office before Patrick and didn’t take a paycheck.\n\nStanding side by side, they also demurred about what the message of a Republican winning after Patrick’s two terms says of the Democrat.\n\n“I think the message is that Charlie Baker won and won after, like I said, a wild ride of a night,” Patrick said. “ … I think you all be analyzing what the election means in some larger sense for a long time. But from my perspective, it means we have a new governor in January.”\n\nPatrick said he also doesn’t have particular initiatives he’ll push Baker to continue.\n\n“Look if Martha Coakley were standing here today or any other successful candidate, they would do some things differently,” Patrick said. “That is part of what happens in elections … It’s the next governor’s prerogative to set the next agenda.”\n\nBaker, adding to a Patrick point, also noted that “especially (with) the bigger initiatives, they take years.”\n\n“There are a whole bunch of things things that are in process that would be pursued and completed in a Baker administration,” he said.\n\nAt one point, a reporter asked Baker his take of the meeting’s tone after Patrick gave his initial description. Baker said his view was “exactly the same,” calling it productive.\n\n“Campaign’s over,” Baker said, echoing Patrick’s phrase from earlier. “This is about moving the state forward.”\n\nWhen the two entered the press conference in the office’s recently renovated lobby, Patrick looked at the rows of reporters and cameras before saying to Baker, “All your friends are here.”\n\nBaker responded, “Yours, too.”\n\nPatrick later said he told Baker to find the “fun” in a job that can churn up a variety of daily challenge. As for the biggest pitfall he warned Baker of, Patrick said, “I think some of that is personal,” before noting there are certain pressing areas they discussed, including the state’s Health Connector and concerns around Ebola."
