        "text": "WEST FALMOUTH â€” Attorney General Martha Coakley attended a meet and greet with a crowd of about 25 people Sunday as part of her campaign for the Democratic nomination for the governor's office.\n\n\"I'm from Texas and now my vote will count,\" said Olivia White as she shook Coakley's hand. White said she supported the attorney general, but since she was new to the area wanted to find out more about the candidate.\n\n\"She's very warm and supportive,\" White said.\n\nMary Ellen Williams, who hosted the event at her home, hadn't put her weight behind Coakley.\n\n\"I think it's important for people to have a comparison before a primary,\" she said.\n\nCoakley is running against Donald Berwick, the former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state Treasurer Steven Grossman for the gubernatorial candidacy.\n\nBefore starting her speech, Coakley connected herself to the locals by letting them know she has a sister in Centerville and another sister on Martha's Vineyard. She then said she wished to build upon Gov. Deval Patrick's work and \"invest in kids and the workforce.\"\n\nThe attorney general addressed education and wanted to \"get beyond teaching children to a test.\" Arts, music, and even recess should still be important, she said.\n\n\"Every child should be able to get a good education,\" she said.\n\nCoakley emphasized the idea of trying different systems of teaching in pilot and charter schools, and implementing the successful programs into the public system. In front of multiple professed Boston school teachers, Coakley also advocated for higher teacher pay.\n\nFrom there she expounded on health care. She made a point to push for better treatment, and overall cultural attitude of mental disease, saying those ailments should be treated no differently than diabetes. She also called for increased transparency and lower health care costs.\n\nAfter a question-and-answer period, Coakley swept the room, thanking everyone for attending. Democratic Town Committee member Kirstin Moritz wasn't swayed from supporting Berwick for the primary but said she would vote for Coakley if she garnered the nomination.\n\n\"In case she is the Democrat nominee, I want to know as much about her as I can,\" she said.\n\nFollow Ethan Genter on Twitter: @ethangentercct."
