        "text": "WORCESTER - Locked in one of the tightest races for governor in the country, Martha Coakley called upon former President Bill Clinton on Thursday to help rally Democrats and make the case that she, and not Republican Charlie Baker, should lead Massachusetts.\n\nClinton, who was delayed by weather arriving at the rally at Clark University, laid out a calm, reasoned pitch for Coakley to build upon what has made Massachusetts successful, including its education system. He said there could be \"no better investment\" than eliminating the waiting list of 17,000 children for early education programs.\n\n\"You've got a model that most of this country and most of the world would die to have. Don't mess it up,\" Clinton told the estimated crowd of 800 supporters who packed into a cozy, warm auditorium to hear the former president speak.\n\nCoakley's campaign has called on a number of high-profile national Democrats to help her try to close a fundraising gap with Baker and energize the electorate before the Nov. 4 election. First Lady Michelle Obama came to Boston for Coakley this month, and Hillary Clinton is expected to headline a rally for Coakley next week.\n\nThe Clinton event helped Coakley bank $200,000 for her campaign, leaving the Democratic ticket of Coakley and Stephen Kerrigan, the party nominee for lieutenant governor, with about $500,000 in cash on hand for the final two-plus weeks of the campaign. The duo raised $647,524 during the first two weeks of the month.\n\nBaker and his running mate Karyn Polito reported raising $787,000 so far in October, leaving the GOP ticket with about $1 million more than their Democratic rivals. Baker had a private fundraiser with former Gov. Mitt Romney planned Thursday night at the Lenox hotel in Boston.\n\nAsked Thursday about Clinton's visit, Baker said, \"I hope he enjoys his time in Massachusetts. I look back on some of the work he did in conjunction with Bill Weld as being significantly positive and the fact that he's here, he's no stranger to Massachusetts, and I hope he has a good time while he's here.\"\n\nClinton repeatedly expressed his fondness for the central Massachusetts city, and said he was happy the Coakley campaign allowed him to come to Worcester, where he recalled visiting as Republicans were trying to \"run me out of office\" and finding 20,000 people on the streets waving signs of support.\n\n\"I don't care what the polls say, she can win this race handily if you want it bad enough,\" Clinton said, describing a political campaign as a job interview where you also get to write the job description.\n\nHe credited Coakley with fighting excessive utility rates and cyber crime, stopping Medicaid fraud and being a \"relentless advocate for children and families against child abuse,\" calling a super PAC ad that challenged her child protection record \"clearly a lie.\"\n\nHe said, \"Quite simply, she has a better record than her opponent.\"\n\nClinton also recalled his own experience as both an attorney general and governor in Arkansas, and said voters can trust that Coakley will deliver on the promises she makes on the trail because she has a record of doing what she says she will.\n\n\"In the worst time in our country's recent history, there was no attorney general in the entire country that did as well as she did in keeping hard-working families in their homes. Thirty-thousand people in this state,\" Clinton said.\n\nBaker on Thursday criticized Coakley for failing to disclose that a non-profit run by her friend and campaign donor Elyse Cherry, who now co-chairs her finance team, stood to benefit from a lawsuit she filed against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nWhile waiting for Clinton to arrive, a series of speakers warmed up the crowd, including U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, Congressman Jim McGovern, candidate for Attorney General Maura Healey, Democratic Party Chairman Sen. Thomas McGee and Gov. Deval Patrick.\n\nPatrick said he felt \"lucky\" to have Coakley representing Democrats in the race for governor, citing her support for earned sick time and an expansion of early childhood education.\n\n\"It's not about getting out to vote. It's about getting out the vote. You gotta get someone else out of bed,\" said Patrick, one of many speakers, including Clinton, who tried to drive home the importance for Democrats of getting out the vote if they want to beat Baker.\n\nClinton said he's heard about how Baker is a \"moderate,\" before criticizing the Republican's position in 2010 against a minimum wage hike, and his more recent opposition to a ballot question that guarantees workers at small companies sick leave benefits.\n\n\"You don't need trickle-down economics,\" he said. \"You need build-out economics that give people who are poor a chance to work their way into the middle-class.\"\n\nBaker supported a more recent minimum wage hike, and has offered an alternative sick leave proposal for to address small business concerns.\n\nCoakley introduced Clinton, first discussing her focus on early education, sick leave for workers and growing the economy in regions outside Boston.\n\n\"We can win this race if we get out this vote, because our message is clear,\" she said.\n\nVice President Joe Biden plans to visit Boston on Oct. 29 for two separate fundraisers for Coakley and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nDescribing himself as an \"old racehorse\" who gets invited to rallies like the one Thursday to see if he can \"get around the track one more time without falling over,\" Clinton acknowledged that his stature has been surpassed by his wife.\n\n\"Hillary's coming up here in a few days and you'll like that better,\" he said."
