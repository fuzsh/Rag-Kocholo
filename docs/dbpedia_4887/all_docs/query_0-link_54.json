        "text": "In a final poll before the Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, Attorney General Martha Coakley held onto her control of the lead over her two opponents.\n\nWith 43%, Coakley ranked almost double to Treasurer Steve Grossman's 23% among voters likely to participate in this week's primary election for governor, according to a poll published last week by The Boston Globe. Donald Berwick, former administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, trailed in third place with 13% of the public's support. Coakley's wide lead was consistent with the results from previous polls.\n\nWhen undecided voters were asked to choose a candidate, though, Coakley's lead increased to 47%, followed by Grossman's to 25%. Berwick's remained at 13%.\n\n'30 in 30': Women to Watch in 2014 â€” Martha Coakley\n\nIn the race to take over Coakley's current position, former assistant Attorney General Maura Healey led former state Sen. Warren Tolman 42% to 27%, the poll found. Healey's favorability grew to almost half of women voters -- Tolman recently apologized to Healey for calling her \"unbecoming\" during a debate. The winner will challenge Republican John Miller in the general election for attorney general.\n\nSocialSphere Inc. conducted the survey for the Globe between Sept. 2 and 3.\n\nCoakley, the first woman to serve as attorney general in Massachusetts, lost to then-state Sen. Scott Brown during the 2010 U.S. Senate race.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Deval Patrick will step down from his position at the end of his current term. On Tuesday, Republican voters will choose between Charlie Baker, leader of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and businessman Mark Fisher. The winners of each race will face off on Nov. 4."
