        "text": "ADVANCES – WEEK OF OCT. 5, 2014\n\nSTATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE\n\nSTATE HOUSE, BOSTON, OCT. 3, 2014…..A month remains until the election and the race for Massachusetts governor stands as a tight affair between Republican Charlie Baker and Democrat Martha Coakley, who are set to meet again in a debate on Tuesday night. While she was fighting off other contenders before the Sept. 9 primary, Coakley held polling leads over Baker, but the most recent surveys score the race as a toss-up and Coakley has struggled to raise money. With Baker holding a significant fundraising advantage, the Democratic Party has begun pouring money into the race, which will likely have impacts elsewhere on the Nov. 4 ballot. Three independent candidates for governor have so far failed to gain traction in polls, although Evan Falchuk appears to be having some impact in part by regularly pointing out the angles of major party politics that Baker and Coakley don’t discuss. While they share much in common in terms of priorities, Baker and Coakley continue to zero in on their differences as they juggle debate, scheduling, and fundraising responsibilities as well as the daily grind of campaigning and the influence of super PAC ads that are not supposed to be coordinated with the candidates but which take clear sides in the race to pick a successor to Gov. Deval Patrick. The governor has strongly supported Coakley since her Sept. 9 primary win – several of his former top aides are steering her campaign – but like her predecessors Tom Reilly and Scott Harshbarger Coakley so far has not felt the complete embrace of Massachusetts Democrats during her run for the Corner Office. Tuesday night’s debate shapes up as the political event of the week, but the candidates for governor will be getting together a lot. Here’s a look at other storylines:\n\n— With an anti-trust deal between the attorney general and the state’s largest health care provider awaiting court approval, stakeholders in the industry plan to gather for annual cost trend hearings Monday and Tuesday. The hearings offer a chance for state officials to question industry leaders and experts and for everyone to get a better grasp on how Massachusetts is doing with its ongoing cost control, coverage, and care delivery experiments. The hearings this year for the first time will include a review of the state’s performance against a 3.6 percent cost growth benchmark intended to keep health care cost growth at or lower than economic growth. Gov. Deval Patrick, Senate President Therese Murray, Auditor Suzanne Bump, Rep. Jeffrey Sanchez and top officials in the health care world will speak at the two-day look at cost trends in Massachusetts. The hearing is the \"Super Bowl of health care in Massachusetts,\" David Seltz, executive director of the Health Policy Commission, quipped this week. The Health Policy Commission, an independent agency that analyzes market trends, is putting together the hearing. A Center for Health Information and Analysis report released in September found insurance premiums and benefit levels relatively stable. But the report also said health care spending rose to more than $50 billion as a shift away from fee-for-service care \"stalled.\" \"We have more people insured than ever before – more than anywhere else in the country – and the fact that there are more people insured and eligible for insurance is going to add to cost,\" Patrick told reporters after the CHIA report was released. \"We have slowed the rate of increase, but we actually need to reduce the total cost of health care, and those alternative payment methods, which were being so widely embraced when they were first put in place – I want to see the uptake continue, so there’s work to do.\"\n\n— It’s been pushed back so many times now that it seems inaccurate to call next Friday a deadline for agreement between the Obama and Patrick administrations over a five-year multi-billion dollar waiver critical to the Massachusetts health care system. The last waiver, a three-year deal, ended June 30 but has been repeatedly extended.\n\n— With Ebola inflicting a deadly toll in West Africa, the arrival of the virus in the United States has quickly emerged as a public health concern, raising questions about response and preparedness. State officials also continue to monitor Enterovirus. On Sept. 23, officials announced an 8-year-old girl from southeastern Massachusetts had tested positive in what public health officials presumed as the first of many cases in the state of a rare strain of a virus that has caused severe respiratory infection in dozens of children around the country.\n\nSATURDAY, OCT. 4, 2014\n\nLAST DAY OF SUFFOLKS DOWNS: Suffolk Downs will celebrate \"what is very likely\" its last day of racing.
