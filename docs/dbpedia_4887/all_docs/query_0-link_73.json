        "text": "Republican Gov.-elect Charlie Baker says he's ready to roll up his sleeves and get to work after defeating Democrat Martha Coakley in one of the closest gubernatorial elections in recent state history.\n\nBaker told reporters on Wednesday that a \"seamless\" transition of power was the first order of business. To that end, he was scheduled to meet later in the day with Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick at the Statehouse.\n\nHe also promised to begin looking for talented and enthusiastic people to serve in his administration, which will take office in January.\n\nCoakley, who waited until Wednesday morning to concede, became emotional at times as she thanked supporters at her campaign headquarters.\n\nShe congratulated Baker and promised to help the next governor in any way she could.\n\nAbout 40,000 votes separated the candidates."
