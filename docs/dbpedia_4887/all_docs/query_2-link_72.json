        "text": "During a brief public appearance on the Vineyard on Saturday, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick defended his plan to allow large-scale commercial wind development off the Island. And he insisted that Islanders still have a say in shaping the future.\n\n“It’s really up to Martha’s Vineyard to decide what is right,” he told a small gathering of print, radio and television reporters following a tour of the Martha’s Vineyard Hospital.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick led a strong cast of dignitaries that appeared in Oak Bluffs on Friday at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Bradley Square affordable housing project.\n\nThe governor arrived shortly after 4 p.m. to speak on behalf of the Island Affordable Housing Fund and the Island Housing Trust, the two organizations that are responsible for the Bradley Square plan."
