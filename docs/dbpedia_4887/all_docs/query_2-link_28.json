        "text": "As a two-term Massachusetts governor, 2020 presidential candidate Deval Patrick made his mark on the state.\n\nThe Democratic governor raised the minimum wage, implemented health care reform and raised taxes. He oversaw the state’s finances during a major recession, steered the state through tragedy after the Boston Marathon bombings and weathered scandals regarding patronage hiring at the Probation Department and the technological failure of the state’s Health Connector.\n\nHere are some of the highs and lows of Patrick’s tenure.\n\nWhat are we missing? Weigh in in the comments section.\n\nNov. 7, 2006: Patrick is elected with 55% of the vote after a heated campaign against Republican Kerry Healey and independent Christy Mihos.\n\nPatrick had never before run for statewide office. He was seen as an upstart candidate, who won the Democratic primary with 50% of the vote against more politically connected Democrats, businessman Chris Gabrieli and Attorney General Thomas Reilly.\n\nJan. 4, 2007: Patrick is sworn in, becoming Massachusetts’ first black governor.\n\nJan. 19, 2007: Patrick signs on to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional cap-and-trade system that puts a price on carbon to reduce emissions from power plants.\n\nFebruary 2007: Patrick is criticized for his use of the perks of his office, such as using a state police helicopter to travel around the state. He agreed to reimburse the state for upgrading his official car from a Ford Crown Victoria to a Cadillac DeVille. He was criticized for spending $27,000 on office furniture and drapes.\n\nMarch 2007: Patrick scales back his work schedule while his wife Diane Patrick is treated for depression.\n\nJune 16, 2018: Patrick signs a 10-year, $1 billion life sciences bill, which has positioned Massachusetts as a national leader in attracting companies in the field.\n\nAug. 4, 2008: Patrick signs a bill establishing an institute to bring broadband internet to rural parts of the state. The broadband initiative would later be overhauled by Gov. Charlie Baker amid financial concerns about the project and a dispute between the organizations working on broadband.\n\n2008: Patrick is forced to make major cuts to the state budget amid signs of recession. The recession continued to worsen, leading to cuts in state services and fiscal challenges for the state over several years.\n\nFeb. 20, 2009: Patrick proposes a 19-cent increase to the state’s 23.5-cent gas tax to improve the state’s transportation system and pay off debt from the Big Dig. His plan encountered strong opposition, and the Legislature rejected it.\n\nPatrick did sign a bill reforming the structure of the state transportation system, eliminating the Turnpike Authority and giving more centralized authority to the Department of Transportation.\n\nJune 30, 2009: Patrick signs an increase in the state sales tax, from 5% to 6.25%, as part of the state budget.\n\nJuly 2, 2009: Patrick signs a bill reforming state ethics laws, banning giving gifts to lawmakers and increasing penalties for bribery and violating state lobbying laws. The bill was prompted by a series of political scandals, including the indictment of House Speaker Sal DiMasi on corruption charges. In 2011, Patrick would be called as a witness in DiMasi’s trial.\n\nJan. 18, 2010: Patrick signs a major education reform bill that expands charter schools, gives superintendents more authority to overhaul failing school districts, and aims to close the achievement gap. The achievement gap remains a major problem today, and policymakers continue to debate the impact of charter schools.\n\nAug. 5, 2010: Patrick signs a bill overhauling the hiring process in the court and probation systems following a series of stories in the Boston Globe about patronage hiring.\n\nProbation Commissioner John O’Brien and two of his deputies were found guilty in federal court in 2014 of running a rigged hiring scheme. Their convictions were overturned on appeal two year later.\n\nAug. 6, 2010: Patrick signs a major Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) reform law allowing employers to obtain criminal records of job applicants over the internet, loosening mandatory minimum sentencing laws for some drug offenses and cutting the time before criminal records can be sealed. The bill also makes Massachusetts the second state to “ban the box,” barring employers from asking about criminal records on job applications.\n\nNov. 2, 2010: Patrick wins reelection with 48% of the vote against the Republican Baker and independent Timothy Cahill.\n\nNov. 22, 2011: Patrick signs a law legalizing three casinos in Massachusetts. Patrick first came out in favor of legalized gambling in 2007, spurring four years of public and legislative debate. The first casino, a slots parlor in Plainville, opened in June 2015.\n\nAug. 3, 2012: Patrick signs a sentencing overhaul, which includes a three-strikes law barring parole for three-time violent felons.\n\nAug. 7, 2012: Patrick signs a bill focused on containing health care costs. The bill was seen as the next step in the universal health care law signed by Gov. Mitt Romney. It established a state target for health care spending growth and created the Health Policy Commission, which holds providers and insurers accountable for meeting that target.\n\nWhile Massachusetts has made some progress in controlling health care costs since the law went into effect, high costs continue to be a problem. Lawmakers have spent the last two sessions considering additional ways to lower health care costs.\n\nAug. 31, 2012: The state-run Hinton Drug Lab in Boston was temporarily shut down after it was revealed that chemist Annie Dookhan falsified the results of tests of drug samples. Dookhan pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and was sentenced to prison for three to five years. Tens of thousands of drug cases were dismissed.\n\nA similar scandal would emerge in 2013, when it was discovered that Amherst drug lab chemist Sonja Farak stole drug samples to feed her addiction. She pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 18 months in jail, and tens of thousands of additional drug cases were dismissed.\n\nNov. 6, 2012: Massachusetts voters legalize medical marijuana. Despite pleas by potential patients, the Patrick administration was unable to complete the licensing process, and the first medical marijuana dispensary did not open until June 2015, after Patrick left office.\n\nJan. 17, 2013: Patrick calls for a hike in the state income tax, from 5.25% to 6.25%, while decreasing the state sales tax, as part of a plan to hike taxes by $1.9 billion to pay for education and transportation. This led to a lengthy legislative debate over taxes.\n\nLawmakers in July 2013 approved a bill, over Patrick’s veto, to raise the gas and cigarette taxes and impose a tax on software services. Amid an outcry over its unintended consequences, Patrick signed a repeal of the tax on software services that September.\n\nApril 15, 2013: Patrick comforts state residents after a bombing at the Boston Marathon kills three people and injures hundreds more. Days later, Patrick issued a “shelter-in-place” order in Boston, Cambridge and Watertown during the manhunt for bomber Dzokhar Tsarnaev. Tsarnaev was caught and sentenced to death. His brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a firefight with police.\n\nSeptember 2013: The disappearance — and ultimate death — of Jeremiah Oliver, a young boy under the supervision of the Department of Children and Families, calls attention to major failures at the department tasked with keeping vulnerable children safe, and prompts a series of investigations and reforms.\n\nOctober 2013: Massachusetts launches the Health Connector, its platform where residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The Connector was a technological failure, leaving residents unable to enroll. The glitch cost the state millions of dollars to fix, and residents were assigned to MassHealth for the year since the state was unable to determine what health insurance they were eligible for.\n\nJune 27, 2014: Patrick signs a law raising the state minimum wage from $8 an hour to $11 an hour by 2017.\n\nAug. 7, 2014: Patrick signs a law requiring insurers to cover up to 14 days of inpatient care, without preauthorization, for patients with substance use disorder. This was the first of several bills lawmakers would ultimately pass to address the epidemic of opioid addiction.\n\nAug. 13, 2014: Patrick signs a gun safety bill, giving police chiefs more discretion in issuing gun license, creating new firearms crimes, requiring the state to report data to a federal background check system and requiring schools to create safety plans.\n\nSeptember 2014: Patrick shakes up the management of the Sex Offender Registry Board, citing criticism of the board’s performance. A lawsuit filed by outgoing chair Saundra Edwards alleged that Patrick fired her for her handling of a case involving Patrick’s brother-in-law Bernard Sigh, who pleaded guilty in a decades-old case to raping his wife. The Supreme Judicial Court ultimately dismissed Edwards’ complaint.\n\nSept. 29, 2014: The Department of Correction fires three officers in response to the death of a man confined at Bridgewater State Hospital. The officers were later tried for involuntary manslaughter, acquitted and returned to their jobs. But the case drew attention to what advocates said was inadequate care for mentally ill inmates at the state’s psychiatric hospital for men who are civilly or criminally committed. The hospital was overhauled under Baker."
