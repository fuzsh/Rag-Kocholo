        "text": "Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick (D) entered the Democratic presidential primary this week. In doing so, Patrick faces the challenge of standing out in an already-crowded primary field whose top-tier contenders hold a significant financial advantage and have been campaigning in key states for more than a year now.\n\nMany are now speculating on the extent to which Patrick will appeal to moderate or progressive primary voters. The eight year stint that Patrick served as governor of Massachusetts, during which time he worked with a state legislature controlled by large Democratic majorities, provides a sense of the the two-term governor’s fiscal policy preferences. Though he is being portrayed as a “moderate” by some in the media, Deval Patrick’s record as governor demonstrates a proclivity for raising tax rates that is shared by his far left primary opponents.\n\nIn 2009, Deval Patrick’s first year as governor, he raised the commonwealth’s sales tax rate 25%, taking it from 5.0% to 6.25%. In addition to imposing Massachusetts’ first sales tax hike in more than three decades, Patrick’s first budget also raised taxes on satellite television, hotel stays, alcohol, and meals.\n\n“The sales tax is not my first choice, and not the preferred course,’’ Patrick said at the time. “It’s the course that the Legislature pursued. I preferred, and still do, more targeted revenue measures that raise, from a particular source, revenue for particular needs.’’\n\nDeval Patrick pushed for more tax increases during his second term as governor. In his 2013 State of the Commonwealth address, Patrick proposed a $1.9 billion tax hike. That 2013 tax hike proposed by Governor Patrick sought to raise the state income tax rate by 19%, taking the rate from 5.25% to 6.25%. Patrick claimed this proposal - which would’ve hit thousands of small businesses, in addition to individuals and families — would “accelerate growth and expand opportunity.”\n\nThe Boston Globe reported at the time that Patrick’s 2013 proposal included “the kind of tax increases few politicians, including Democrats, have dared to push.”\n\nThe income tax hike pushed by Governor Patrick in 2013 was subsequently killed by the Democratic-run Massachusetts Legislature only six months after it was proposed. The new budget approved by Massachusetts lawmakers that year did include a tobacco tax hike, a gas tax hike, and an expansion of the sales tax to computer services that was dubbed the “tech tax.”\n\nThat 2013 Massachusetts tech tax - as the Seattle City Council had to do with its 2018 head tax targeting tech companies - was ultimately repealed only a few months after it was enacted.\n\n“The tax had only been in effect for less than two months, and in that short time an outcry from the state's technology industry prompted the approval of a ballot initiative to repeal the tax and the threat of a lawsuit,” wrote the Tax Foundation’s Elia Peterson. “After the industry pushback, the same lawmakers that didn't realize the full effect of such a policy prior to implementation reexamined the law and subsequently changed their positions.”\n\nIronically, a year after Governor Patrick proposed a sizable state income tax hike, the Massachusetts state income tax actually dropped down from 5.25% to 5.2%. No Bay State lawmakers could be thanked for that relief, as it was triggered by a law passed in 2002 that mandates the state income tax rate automatically drop by 0.05 percentage points if certain revenue goals are met in a given budget year.\n\nThat income tax cut trigger remains in effect in Massachusetts until a minimum income-tax rate of 5% is reached. Triggered cuts have since brought the commonwealth’s income tax rate down to 5.05% today.\n\n“Deval Patrick is many things, but a moderate is certainly not one of them. Massachusetts was fortunate that many of his more radical proposals were shot down by state legislature—despite Democrats maintaining supermajority control throughout his eight years in office,” noted Paul D. Craney, spokesman for the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance. “The legislature may have been under the absolute control of his own political party, but Patrick’s relationship with legislative leadership was rocky at best.”\n\nTaxpayer-Backed Unfunded Pension Liabilities Increased During Deval Patrick’s Administration:\n\nDuring Deval Patrick’s time as governor, Bay State policy experts and political observers contend that core state priorities fell by the wayside in favor of pet projects. During the Patrick administration, the Pioneer Institute, a Boston-based think tank, reports that “state education funding increased at an annualized rate of just 2.21% from FY 2008 to FY 2015 – barely matching gross domestic product (GDP) growth and inflation for the period – down from 4.66% annually during the Romney administration”\n\nThe Patrick administration’s eight years, lasting from 2009 to 2015, did coincide with an increase in taxpayer-backed debt. Researchers at the Pioneer Institute point out how the commonwealth used pension funding as a piggy bank during Patrick’s time as governor and failed to return borrowed money. Unfunded retirement liabilities for pensions and health care had reached $42.2 billion as of fiscal year 2013, which Pioneer Institute researchers described as a “critical long-term threat to the commonwealth’s fiscal stability.”\n\nBy the time Patrick left office, the Bay State’s long-term debt and unfunded retiree obligations totaled approximately $66 billion, which was nearly twice the state’s budget that year. By Patrick’s final year in office, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) debt and unfunded retiree liabilities reached $8.3 billion, with operating expenses far outstripping the revenue received from sources like the sales tax, local assessments, and other fees.\n\nDeval Patrick Shot Down Pension Transparency Reform As Governor\n\nDeval Patrick, during his second term as governor and as part of the final budget he enacted, used his veto pen to strike down a reform approved by the legislature that would’ve increased government transparency by making the financials of the MBTA and its retirement fund open to the public.\n\nAs he hits the campaign trail this fall and winter, there is a chance that Deval Patrick will get the opportunity to further explain why he vetoed that measure supported by a Democrat-run legislature that was designed to increase transparency when it comes to the use of taxpayers dollars.\n\nIf Patrick is looking for an issue with which to differentiate himself from other Democratic primary candidates, he could do so by coming out in support of policy reforms that expand school choice. As has been documented in this space, not a single Democrat running for president is calling for an expansion of school choice, including those like Cory Booker who had once been advocates for expanding choice in education.\n\nAn examination of Patrick’s education policy record as governor, however, does not offer any evidence to suggest that he will be a leader on education policy reform.\n\n“Soon after taking office in 2007, Gov. Deval Patrick eliminated the commonwealth's independent school district accountability office, which had a bad habit of telling inconvenient truths to an education establishment that was among the governor's largest campaign contributors,” wrote Pioneer Institute fellow Charles Chieppo in a December 2014 Providence Journal op-ed. “Today we have virtually no accountability for a system on which state and local taxpayers spend about $9 billion annually.”\n\nWhile Massachusetts has high marks for student achievement, “attributing that progress to Governor Patrick’s leadership is like suggesting that a pinch runner who finds himself on third base hit a triple,” wrote Jim Stergios, the Pioneer Institute’s executive director, in a January 2015 Boston Globe op-ed.\n\n“The best one can say about overall student achievement in the Commonwealth during Patrick’s terms in office is that it has been stagnant,” added Stergios. “An objective observer would note significant areas of decline.”\n\nThe Washington Post reported on November 14 that the former Massachusetts governor “has no campaign cash, little campaign staff, low probability of qualifying for debates — and just 81 days to go, as of Thursday, before voting begins.”\n\nWhether Deval Patrick can surmount the challenges that come with such a late entry into a crowded presidential primary is a question to which the answer will be soon become apparent."
