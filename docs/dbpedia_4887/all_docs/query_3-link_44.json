        "text": "Governor Deval Patrick will discuss his memoir, \"A Reason to Believe: Lessons from an Improbable Life.\"\n\nIn January 2007, Deval Patrick became the first African American governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, one of only two African American governors elected in American history. That was just one triumphant step in a long, improbable journey that began in a poor tenement on the South Side of Chicago. From a chaotic childhood to an elite boarding school in New England, to a sojourn doing relief work in Africa to the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies and now to a career in politics. Patrick has led an extraordinary life guided by the advice of his grandmother: hope for the best and work for it.\n\nA graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Governor Patrick has worked as an attorney for the NAACP, Legal Defense Fund and was later appointed by President Clinton as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. He has also been General Counsel of Texaco and Coca-Cola. In 2010 he was re-elected Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nCopies of the book will be available for purchase and signing. Proceeds benefit the Eric Friedheim National Journalism Library. No outside books will be permitted. Admission is free for NPC members and $5 for non-members."
