        "text": "1. What’s his appeal?\n\nMr. Patrick’s biography is a classic rags-to-riches story that makes for a compelling stump speech. Raised by a single mother on Chicago’s South Side, he frequently slept on the floor because there were not enough beds. With some lucky breaks — including a scholarship to a prestigious boarding school — he eventually graduated from Harvard Law School. His first public-sector role was assistant attorney general for civil rights under the Clinton administration.\n\n2. What exactly did he do at Bain Capital?\n\nAfter leaving the governor’s office, Mr. Patrick joined the private equity firm Bain Capital in 2015, heading up an investment fund that focuses on socially responsible investments. The fund acquired interests in fitness centers in the Midwest, a vegan fast-food chain and sushi restaurants serving sustainable fish, among other businesses. With private equity under attack by other Democrats, Mr. Patrick could face questions about his Bain connection as well as other business ties, including stints at Texaco and Coca-Cola and board memberships.\n\n3. Why did he get into the campaign so late?\n\nMr. Patrick had considered joining the presidential race earlier, but announced in December 2018 that he had decided against it, citing the “cruelty” of the elections process. At the time, his wife had cancer, but she is now healthy. With some Democrats expressing unease in recent months about the party’s ability to defeat President Trump, Mr. Patrickdecided in November to enter the race. While he is regarded as a potentially formidable candidate, his 11th-hour decision puts him at a considerable disadvantage in funding and organization.\n\nMr. Patrick and Michael R. Bloomberg both entered the race in November. We looked at how they could reshape the Democratic contest.\n\nMr. Patrick was an early supporter of gay marriage, and he explained why in this Washington Post piece.\n\nMr. Patrick’s wife, Diane, is the granddaughter of Brooklyn’s first black elected official, Bertram Baker.\n\nNPR did this story on Mr. Patrick’s memoir, “Reason to Believe.”"
