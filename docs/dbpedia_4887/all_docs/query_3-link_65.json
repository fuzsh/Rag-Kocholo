        "text": "Deval Patrick has a remarkable American story. He started from a humble background and has achieved great success in law, business, and government. In 1994, President Clinton appointed Governor Patrick the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. In 2006, he was elected as the first black Governor of Massachusetts and served two terms. Earlier this year, Governor Patrick was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nSince his presidential campaign, Governor Patrick founded TogetherFund, a political action committee to support progressive politics and to engage disenfranchised and marginalized voters. He also launched a podcast, Being American, where he engages in conversations with actors, activists, celebrities, and others to explore the country’s character.\n\nThis conversation—two weeks after the presidential election—will give us the unique opportunity to hear Governor Patrick discuss his vision for the future of our country.\n\nSpeaker\n\nDeval Patrick, Former Governor of Massachusetts\n\nModerator\n\nBill Kennedy, chair, Public Policy, Nutter"
