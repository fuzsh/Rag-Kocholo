        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nDeval Patrick dropped out of the 2020 presidential race the day of the New Hampshire primary on February 11, 2020.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nWho is Deval Patrick?\n\nCurrent job: 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nAge: 63.\n\nFamily: Patrick and his wife Diane have two adult daughters, Katherine and Sarah.\n\nPrevious jobs: Managing director at private equity firm Bain Capital 2015-2019, governor of Massachusetts from 2007-2015, businessman, assistant US attorney for the Civil Rights Division 1994-1997, corporate lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho was Patrick's direct competition for the nomination?\n\nBased on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can identify the other candidates competing in Deval Patrick's lane, and who his broader opponents are within the party.\n\nPatrick was a more recent addition to our surveys and at this time has an insufficient sample size for which to draw conclusions.\n\nInsider has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as the nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.\n\nWhat are Deval Patrick's policy positions?\n\nOn healthcare:\n\nPatrick's campaign website says he envisions \"a health care system that provides access to high-quality, low-cost health services everywhere and for every single individual, bar none.\"\n\nIn a November 14 appearance on CBS \"This Morning,\" Patrick said he does not support Medicare for All \"in the terms we've been talking about.\"\n\nOn guns:\n\nAs Massachusetts' governor, Patrick pushed for several gun control measures including stricter regulations on firearms and limiting purchases.\n\nIn 2014, Patrick signed legislation giving Massachusetts police chiefs the authority to block certain individuals from getting gun licenses and closing the so-called gun show loophole, which allowed some gun sales to slip through the cracks of the background check system.\n\nOn immigration:\n\nHis campaign website advocates for \"an immigration system that provides for both border integrity and human dignity, that encourages the determined and creative whose values align with ours to make their home here.\"\n\nOn climate change:\n\nIn the late 1990s, Patrick was a top executive at oil and gas company Texaco managing its eventual merger with Chevron.\n\nAs Massachusetts' governor, Patrick signed legislation promoting the use of biofuels, subsiding the creation of green energy jobs, and setting targets to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and publicly called for \"a future free of fossil fuels\" in 2014, one of the first governors to do so.\n\nOn campaign finance:\n\nUnlike many other 2020 candidates, Patrick hasn't shied away from PAC money. According to a report from OpenSecrets, Patrick created his Reason to Believe PAC in 2018 to help pay for consulting in advance of his presidential bid, with the majority of his donations coming from just six donors.\n\nPatrick's PAC additionally donated to several Democratic 2018 House of Representatives candidates.\n\nHis campaign website decries \"the explosion of dark money into elections\" and \"the influence of paid lobbyists.\"\n\nOn the social safety net:\n\nAs Massachusetts' governor, Patrick took steps to expand coverage and resources to combat Massachusetts' opioid crisis.\n\nOn abortion:\n\nPatrick supports abortion rights. In 2014, he signed legislation allowing police to bar anti-abortion protesters from blocking access to clinic entrances.\n\nOn LGBTQ rights:\n\nAs governor, Patrick actively fought against a proposed ballot measure that sought to repeal the state's 2004 legalization of same-sex marriage. His daughter Katherine is openly lesbian.\n\nOn education:\n\nPatrick's campaign website advocates for strong education policy \"from pre-K to community college, and right through workforce development and retraining, because education is the single best investment the public can make in its own collective future.\"\n\nPatrick boasts quadrupling state capital spending on Massachusetts' public colleges' classrooms and resources, as well as expanding access to early education and universal kindergarten.\n\nOn criminal justice:\n\nPatrick's campaign website advocates for \"a justice system that focuses less on warehousing people than on preparing them to re-enter responsible life.\"\n\nIn 2014, Patrick signed criminal justice reform legislation expanding both comprehensive re-entry programs for formerly incarcerated people and drug treatment as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n\"For a long time, tough on crime policies made good sound-bites, but they have not made us safer, they have cost us a fortune and they have contributed to the unwise and unnecessary devastation of entire communities and multiple generations,\" Patrick said in 2014.\n\nOn foreign policy:\n\nIn 2014, Patrick gave a tearful speech offering to provide support and shelter for some of the minors that were part of the influx of unaccompanied migrant children coming across the border into the United States, calling it a \"humanitarian crisis.\"\n\n\"I believe that one day, we will all have to answer for our actions,\" he said. \"My faith teaches me that if a stranger dwells in your land, you shall not mistreat them, but love them as yourself.\"\n\nOn taxes:\n\nIn his November 14 interview on CBS \"This Morning,\" Patrick didn't come out in support of the wealth tax on the wealthiest Americans that fellow 2020 candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have proposed.\n\n\"Taxes should go up on the most prosperous … a wealth tax makes a lot of sense directionally. But my idea would be a much, much simpler tax system for everyone,\" Patrick said, adding, \"Wealth is not the problem, greed is the problem.\"\n\nOn corporate regulation:\n\nPatrick has been scrutinized for his work on the board of ACC Capital Holdings, the parent company of Ameriquest, which the Huffington Post described as \"the world's largest subprime lender during the housing bubble\" and \"a financial time bomb targeting middle-class families, particularly families of color.\"\n\nOn democracy reform:\n\nPatrick's campaign website lays out a \"democracy agenda\" that includes ending partisan gerrymandering, voter suppression, and dark money in politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat were Deval Patrick's political successes?\n\nPatrick prevailed as a little-known candidate in the crowded 2006 Democratic primary for governor of Massachusetts, and defeated Lt. Gov. Kerry Healy in the general election, returning control of the governor's office to Democrats for the first time since 1991.\n\nTo this day, Patrick is still just the second elected African-American governor in US history, following former Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder. (David Paterson was appointed as governor of New York in 2008 after Eliot Spitzer's resignation).\n\nPatrick has also forged a close allyship and friendship with former President Barack Obama, and was a key surrogate for Obama in his 2012 presidential re-election bid.\n\nHow much money has Deval Patrick raised?\n\nSince Patrick just entered the race, we don't have any fundraising data for his presidential campaign yet. His Reason to Believe PAC has raised $843,680 since 2018, and has spent the PAC's money on consulting and polling, according to campaign finance records.\n\nRead more:\n\nHere's everyone who's running for president in 2020, and who has quit the race\n\nThe Democratic elite is panicked about Joe Biden, but he's far more popular with voters than donors\n\n9 places to visit in Massachusetts that aren't Boston \"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
