Today’s neck-and-neck election for governor of Massachusetts marks a new political era for the Bay State: Governor Deval Patrick is not on the ballot. But he is invested in the outcome. The Democrat, who is not seeking a third term, has been a vocal supporter of Attorney General Martha Coakley, who faces Republican Charlie Baker in today’s race. Patrick spoke this afternoon with WAMC’s Alan Chartock.
