Attorney General Martha Coakley would follow Gov. Deval Patrick’s example of intervening in a family business dispute — like the Market Basket feud — if elected governor, she told the Herald yesterday.

“If the governor is able to play a role in something that seems to me to be a preventable dissolution of what’s been a long family-owned business here in Massachusetts, then he should, and I would as governor,” said Coakley, noting the economic impact the long squabble has had on both the state and thousands of workers.

During an hour-plus meeting with the Herald yesterday, Coakley was pressed on a wide range of topics:

• She defended changing her mind on driver’s licenses for illegal immigration — saying she’d create an immigrant safety director to “pave the way” for illegals to get driver’s licenses. “For someone that comes in and says, ‘I support this statute, I support that statute,’ oftentimes that’s great on the campaign trail, but not so great for someone who has to make tough decisions and implement them,” said Coakley;

• She said she believes the police response since the shooting of Michael Brown has “inflamed” the racial tension in Ferguson, Mo. “There was no trust between the police and the population in the first instance and now it’s just escalated,” she said;

• She’s eyeing a 15 percent voter turnout for the Sept. 9 primary, but remains hopeful voters will soon take notice of the race. “Three weeks in this business is a lifetime,” Coakley said. “It seems like it’s short, but people will start paying attention;”

• She’s prepared to sign a People’s Pledge — limiting outside spending in the campaign — saying it’s the only way to keep Super PAC money out of the race;

• She vowed to have the money and resources to compete with Republican favorite Charlie Baker if she makes it to the general election and predicted she’d benefit from Democrats being united as early as the day after the primary. “I’ve seen it happen before. I’m sure it will happen again”; and,

• On the heels of the Herald’s series on unsolved murders in Boston, Coakley said bringing the victim witness fund back up to $1 million “makes a big difference.”

She added, “A lot of folks are eyewitnesses to something who are connected. They just happened to see something. They don’t need to be relocated to Texas, but they need to know … that they and their families will be contacted. … We have to ensure their safety as best we can.”
