Martha Coakley launches bid for Mass. governor

Democrat Martha Coakley's loss for the U.S. Senate in 2010 was a bruising affair, made worse because it was under the nation's glare in predominantly blue Massachusetts.

Three years later, the attorney general for Massachusetts says she's learned from her mistakes and will run in 2014 to succeed Gov. Deval Patrick.

"A lot of folks say that politics is tough and it can be. I know what it's like to lose a race. I know how hard that is," Coakley says in a video declaring her candidacy for governor. "But you know what? It's nothing compared to what so many people go through every day in their lives."

Coakley was defeated by then-little known GOP state senator Scott Brown for the seat held for decades by liberal icon Edward Kennedy, who died in office. President Obama campaigned for Coakley, whose campaign included a much-derided gaffe in which she suggested former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling was a New York Yankees fan.

Brown was defeated for re-election in 2012 by Democrat Elizabeth Warren and has already ruled out a 2014 race for Massachusetts governor.

Coakley joins a crowded Democratic field that includes Steven Grossman, the state treasurer, and Don Berwick, who led the Medicare program under Obama, and other current or former elected officials. Republican Charles Baker, who was defeated by Patrick in 2010, recently announced his gubernatorial campaign.
