        "text": "Outdoor movies combine two things we love about L.A.: an appreciation of movie-making and spending as much time as possible outside. Alfresco screenings usually start to pop up across the city in the early spring and continue into the fall and holiday season, be it atop rooftop bars, at L.A.â€™s best parks or even at a Hollywood cemetery.\n\nMost of our favorite outdoor series fall into two formats: Alfresco screenings where moviegoers bring their own chair or blanket and can pack together some picnic food, and rooftop ones where youâ€™ll be offered a seat and some on-site snacks as you catch films both old and new. (If youâ€™re looking for a fun date idea, this one takes the cake.) Be sure to check back all year long for updates on the list, as new screenings are always being added.\n\nLooking to see a new movie any night of the week? Check out the best movie theaters in L.A. or the few remaining old-school drive-in movie theaters. And for some at-home inspiration, you can always catch up on the best L.A. movies of all time.\n\nFor screenings with multiple movies on a single night, each film is separately ticketed unless otherwise noted. Also, movie selections tend to change, but weâ€™ll do our best to keep the list below updated on a weekly basis.\n\nA month-by-month calendar of L.A.â€™s outdoor movies\n\nAugust\n\nAug 1\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents The Mask + American Psycho at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nTropicana Movie Nights presents Almost Famous at the Hollywood Roosevelt.\n\nAug 2\n\nFamily Friday Movie Night presents Luca at the Huntington.\n\nOC Parks Sunset Cinema presents Frozen II at Irvine Regional Park (Orange).\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Legally Blonde + Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nSummer Movie Nights presents Transformers: Rise of the Beasts at Hart Park (Santa Clarita).\n\nAug 3\n\nCinespia presents Bridesmaids at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nClassic Films Under the Stars presents Bye Bye Birdie at Brand Park (Glendale).\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Drop Dead Gorgeous + Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents Mad Max: Fury Road at Will Rogers State Historic Park.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents Grease at Westdrift Golf Course.\n\nAug 4\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents The Great Gatsby at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nSummer Poolside Cinema presents The Proposal at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel & Bungalows Santa Monica.\n\nAug 5\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Pretty Woman at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents The Incredibles at Pearson Park Amphitheatre (Anaheim).\n\nAug 6\n\nMoonlight Movies on the Beach presents The Breakfast Club at Granada Beach.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents La La Land at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nAug 7\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Jurassic Park at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nAug 8\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents The Proposal + The Sixth Sense at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nTropicana Movie Nights presents Once Upon a Timeâ€¦ in Hollywood at the Hollywood Roosevelt.\n\nAug 9\n\nOC Parks Sunset Cinema presents Napoleon Dynamite at Irvine Regional Park (Orange).\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Dick + Friday at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nAug 10\n\nCinespia presents True Romance at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents 50 First Dates + Jenniferâ€™s Body at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents Clueless at Grand Hope Park.\n\nStreet Food Cinema presents The Mummy at the Autry.\n\nAug 11\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Inception at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nSummer Poolside Cinema presents Bohemian Rhapsody at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel & Bungalows Santa Monica.\n\nAug 12\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Anyone But You at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nAug 13\n\nMoonlight Movies on the Beach presents Mamma Mia! at Granada Beach.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Mamma Mia! at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nAug 14\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents Love Jones at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nAug 15\n\nRooftop Cinema Club presents American Pie at LEVEL DTLA.\n\nTropicana Movie Nights presents Boyz n the Hood at the Hollywood Roosevelt.\n\nAug 16\n\nFamily Friday Movie Night presents Tangled at the Huntington.\n\nMovies & Moonlight presents Jumanji at 2nd & PCH (Long Beach).\n\nOC Parks Sunset Cinema presents The Super Mario Bros.
