        "text": "A second year essay submitted as part of my ‘Cinema Asia’ module, examining the work of celebrated Japanese auteur Yasujiro Ozu, and the perspectives from which his legacy is framed\n\nThe notion of authorship in cinema and particularly the study of film is enduring. Regarded as a notable form of theory and discussion, it is however a topic that does not come without debate. Perhaps what makes the concept of authorship such a contestable one is that there are many facets to the construct, as Croft (1998, p. 310) comments, “for, unlike most other ways of making sense of cinema, discourses of authorship have emerged across the whole gamut of cinematic institutions”. Agreeing on a singular, definitive definition of authorship or the auteur may be seen to compromise the breadth of work and influence that is required to create a film, but the central function of the theory is one that asserts individual impact and creativity, and mainly settles this feat upon the director.\n\nTo use this understanding of authorship in examining a director and their body of work, the particular films in question, their content, and their form, must be contextualised in order to acknowledge why some may consider a particular director an auteur, or perhaps why they should not. In this essay Japanese cinema will be central, which Yoshimoto (2000, cited in Phillips & Stringer, 2007, p. 10) states as being “inseparable from the question of how film studies has constituted itself, legitimated its existence, and maintained its institutional territoriality through a double process of inclusion and exclusion”. This highlights the lens through which Japanese cinema has been historically viewed and studied in academic work, and when paired, as in this essay, with another contested area of study such as authorship, there are many nuances of discussion which could be explored.\n\nFor that reason this essay will focus directly on Yasujiro Ozu and his films Tokyo Story (1953) and Good Morning (1959) with the intention of establishing examples in form and content that reflect an authorial stamp. A director with a rich and vast filmography, Ozu’s work displays intent to create a distinct style, something which is regarded as a key indicator in the estimation of authorship.\n\nBorn in 1902 in the Fukagawa district of Tokyo, Yasujiro Ozu’s career as a director spanned thirty-five years. Sharp (2019, para. 6) claims that of the 54 films Ozu made only 36 are surviving, as most of the missing features, including his debut, were created in the pre-war silent-era. This loss is not specific to Ozu, as Richie (2003, para. 2) states, “the destruction of the Japanese cinema is extraordinary”. The loss of films from the late 1800s to the late 1940s is attributed to a number of factors, including the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake, the 1945 fire-bombing of major Japanese cities, and most notably, the postwar Allied Occupation which saw the torching of films in an act of censorship. These events are estimated to have resulted in “the destruction of ninety percent of all Japanese films made before 1945” (Richie, 2003, para. 2), a statistic so incomprehensible it struggles to emphasise the impact of what is essentially a missing canon of Japanese pre-war films on the country’s film industry and heritage. Perhaps, then, this serves to accentuate the influence of Ozu and how he came to be internationally regarded as one of Japan’s most-acclaimed filmmakers. Working from the silent-era and through World War II into the post-war era, it is claimed that Ozu demonstrated the best development of his style in a way that Schilling (2013, para. 7) explains in writing that “his postwar films are considered most ‘Ozu-esque’”. For a director’s name to be used in the very description of the style their films display is an early reference to just how significant Ozu’s influence is.\n\nBefore magnifying and examining the style of Ozu’s films through their form and content, it may serve well to attempt to understand the filmmaker’s intent in their choosing of a particular mood, subject matter, or narrative. Lyttleton (2016, para. 3) summarises Ozu’s body of work as being “the same movie over and over again: quiet, understated dramas that often felt like variations on the same theme”. Despite this retrospective assessment, Ozu’s very first feature, Sword of Penitence (1927), was a period film. Translated literally in Japan as ‘jidaigeki’, the genre accounted for films primarily set in the Japanese Edo period of 1603–1868 which encompassed a range of various swordplay, with the samurai subgenre being most widely known (Schilling, 2015, para. 3). Sword of Penitence, though a conventional jidaigeki film, is a story formed by Ozu after he found inspiration in two American melodramas; Kick In (1922) and Hoodman Blind (1923) (Richie, 1971, p. 4). For jidaigeki to be a genre considered so entrenched in Japanese culture and history it is remarkable that Ozu would be inspired by his American contemporaries and seek to display this influence in his own work. This can be seen to be asserted by Richie (1971, p. 4) who writes that Ozu “didn’t feel like being a director, certainly not a director of jidaigeki” in the early days of his career. Rather than follow the form of jidaigeki as a popular genre of Japanese cinema at the time, Ozu had other intentions, and especially through understanding the international influence the filmmaker displayed in his work it is interesting to see how scholars and critics initially remarked upon Ozu’s films as being a hallmark example of Japanese cinema. Sharp (2019, para. 1) asserts this idea in writing “too often have English-language writers misleadingly emphasised the role of his country’s artistic and philosophical traditions in shaping his distinctive aesthetic”.\n\nHowever, Ozu’s particular aesthetic style is one that mostly had not been witnessed before in cinema, Hollywood or Japanese. Sharp (2019, para. 4) comments that Ozu “pared down his aesthetic throughout his working life”, and with many of his earlier films, Hollywood-influenced comedies and melodramas, lost over time, the entire evolution of his style in both form and content sadly struggles to be fully comprehended. Features such as Dragnet Girl (1933), which for Sharp (2019, para. 9) “is barely recognisable as a Japanese film, let alone one from the future director of Tokyo Story” as a result of its contemporary western costumes and settings, and lighting and framing resemblant of a Hollywood noir, is an example of Ozu’s breadth of work. It was post World War II where Ozu and his screenwriter Kogo Noda embarked upon a more definitive approach to form and content, creating Ozu’s best-known feature Tokyo Story and what Scanlon (2020, para. 6) defines as “the very essence of ‘Ozu-esque’”, 1959’s Good Morning.\n\nOzu often revisited his earlier silent features post-war and Good Morning is one of the best examples of his repurposing of old material. Loosely returning to the comedy I Was Born, But… (1932), Good Morning centres around two young boys who defy their parents by refusing to talk when they will not buy them a TV set. At surface level the form and content of Good Morning is plainly Ozu’s choice of style. Set in a suburban neighbourhood where familial communication is the heart of the tale, Rosenbaum (2017, para. 3) notes that Good Morning is a clear example of Ozu utilising his style and form to represent discourse concerning social and political matters by writing “that in Ozu, expressions of social forms and expressions of cinematic forms are simply two sides of the same coin”.\n\nThis notion may however be hidden in the initial visual motifs of the film. It is bright and colourful, with outdoor shots that feel expansive and natural due to the depth of the shot and the sweep of the sky above. The interior sets are more indicative of the locations typically used in Ozu’s films, as Schilling (2013, para. 8) asserts, “in shooting his families, Ozu preferred interiors, particularly in Japanese-style houses”. The family home in Good Morning is characterised by the division of the rooms, the sliding wooden and glass doors and the mat flooring. There is complexity, however, in this apparent normality; Rosenbaum (2017, para. 3) comments on the depth of “formal ingenuity Ozu can exercise with visual rhymes in the riotous colours and identical square shapes (on quilts, other furnishings, clothes) of his scenic design”. The costumes, particularly those of the boys, are delightful in the way they match and fit, red turtlenecks for the top half, and navy-blue trousers for the bottom. Though many of Ozu’s films feature suburban family interiors, the visual design signifies a denial that these spaces have to be monotonous or uniform.\n\nIntended meaning is also embroidered in the positioning of the camera through its connection to the scene’s setting. There are two notable types of shot employed by Ozu that are idiosyncratic to his body of work; the ‘tatami shot’, and the ‘pillow shot’. The tatami shot is named so due to the low-angle framing of the shot, as if seated on a traditional Japanese tatami mat, a spot from which many of the conversations in Ozu’s films play out. The pillow shot earns its name from the phrase in classical poetry that refers to “short addendums to a line that reflect on or even shift the meaning of what comes next” (Singer, 2016, para. 2), a description reflective of Ozu’s inclusion of seemingly random shots of everyday life. In Good Morning these shots include washing on a line, or the arrival of new home goods littered around the house, from a TV set to a pair of red heels, which Singer (2016, para. 6) interprets as a “comment on the modernisation of (and often Americanisation) of Japanese life”.\n\nOther characterised uses of Ozu’s camera include the low camera position to flatten the image, the framing of characters in medium close-ups and an unconventional angle to the lens, which causes a mismatched eyeline effect (Sharp, 2019, p. 3). Such devotion is given to the use of the camera to portray meaning that Singer (2016, para. 1) remarks that in Ozu’s films “any diversions from these refined parameters are rare”, and it is easy to see why; they provide excerpts that tell the audience more than perhaps even dialogue could, that personify both the human simplicity of Ozu’s stories and the meticulous attention to detail imbued throughout.\n\nTokyo Story, as Lyttleton (2016, para. 7) writes, is “in many ways the perfect entry point to Ozu, exemplifying so much of what’s special about his work”, a statement also echoed by Bordwell (2013, para. 3), who writes the film is “a generous introduction to his distinct world. It contains in miniature a great many of the qualities that enchant his admirers”.\n\nBy this point, in what is considered the third act in his career, Ozu had masterfully established a distinct approach to his manipulation of form and content. The story of Tokyo Story itself is effortlessly mundane in the way only Ozu could achieve, following yet another family dynamic that Bordwell (2013, para. 4) describes as carrying “to the limit Ozu’s faith that everyday life, rendered tellingly, provides more than enough drama to engage us deeply”. When an elderly couple travel to Tokyo to visit their children, now adults, they find them without time or attention. It falls to Noriko (Setsuko Hara), their widowed daughter-in-law, to entertain the parents, and in turn Tokyo Story portrays a wealth of subtle dynamics, personalities, and intricacies of communication. Ozu finely displays his trademark tact and understanding in the subject of everyday normality through the film, using this apparent simplicity to tell a tale regarding “the disintegration of the family unit in the postwar era” (Scanlon, 2020, para. 14).\n\nThe display of form in Tokyo Story is also as expected. As Bordwell (2013, para. 7) writes, the “low camera height, 180 degree cuts, virtually no camera movements, and shots linked through overlapping bits of space” are all present, exemplifying Ozu’s style and intention to create a form of detachment from the compassion of the narrative, as one would feel while watching and even pursuing their everyday life.\n\nThrough the examples of Tokyo Story and Good Morning it is evident and almost universally agreed that Ozu’s work is a showcase of form and content that displays a distinct authorial stamp. While it may appear simple to conclude that Ozu is an auteur, it is also imperative to consider how his work has been regarded, and how, due to his films being some of the first Japanese features to gain recognition internationally, this has impacted the way in which he is defined as an auteur.\n\nA common misconception regarding Ozu is that his films were inherently inspired and driven by Japanese culture — “he was the most Japanese of Japanese directors” was a statement written by Alexander Jacoby in his 2008 ‘Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors’ (Jacoby, cited in Rosenbaum, 2017, para. 7). Lyttleton (2016, para. 2) notes that Ozu “was always acclaimed at home, but only found an international following after his passing thanks to fans and critics like Paul Schrader and David Bordwell”. Tokyo Story was the first of Ozu’s films to be shown overseas, primarily in Europe and most notably when critic Donald Richie curated a retrospective of five Ozu films at the 1963 Berlin Film Festival, and even then it was not released in the US until 1972 (Lyttleton, 2016, para. 2). US audiences had already at this point been exposed to Japanese cinema through the success of Rashomon (Kurosawa, 1950), a jidaigeki of the type that Ozu had been reluctant to devote his career to making. Bordwell (2013, para. 1) declares that “the time would have been ripe for a very different sort of Japanese film to arrive on the global stage” after Rashomon’s success, and despite Ozu’s burgeoning success in his home country, the rich catalogue of his films was blocked from international release by the Japanese studio Shochiku in the belief “overseas audiences wanted the exoticism of samurai and geisha, not Ozu’s quietly realistic dramas about contemporary middle-class families” (Schilling, 2013, para. 2).\n\nThe aforementioned reason for Shochiku’s reluctance in releasing Ozu’s films internationally asserts the unprecedented individuality of his style and an argument against the retrospective assessment that his work is bound solely to Japanese culture. Rosenbaum (2017, para. 7) reflects on this in writing that “Ozu’s grasp of both reality and formality was much more tied to his sense of Hollywood studio filmmaking than to some idea of Japanese “otherness””, where for all the Japanese culture on display in Ozu’s films the narrative itself was often inspired by a Hollywood production, blending the lines between what would be considered so unknown to international audiences.\n\nThis evaluation of Ozu’s intention goes hand in hand with the very form and content embedded in his films; as Schilling (2013, para. 41) states, Ozu’s “genius was to transform everyday things into eternal truths, in ways immediately recognisable as utterly his own”. For Japanese audiences Ozu’s films were a representation of home life, of family dynamic, never far from their own experiences. But this does not mean that the stories are separate to that of the life of international audiences, and on closer inspection of the form, content, and meaning in Ozu’s films, it is clear that in fact, they are closer to life than many may have initially assumed."
