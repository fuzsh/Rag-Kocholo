        "text": "Entertainment is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nMovie opinions can be...harsh. Critics and audiences alike.\n\nThis leads me to a tale as old as time in Hollywood: Critics and audiences not seeing eye-to-eye in their film reviews.\n\nSo, I gathered movie scores using Rotten Tomatoes to single out movies that had alarming percentile differences between audience and critics scores:\n\n*NOTE*: I chose to exclude movies like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Captain Marvel, Ghostbusters (2016), and others that were subject to \"review-bombing\" on movie review sites.\n\n1. Warcraft — 48% difference between critics (28%) and audiences (76%).\n\n2. Sausage Party — 32% difference between critics (82%) and audiences (50%).\n\n3. But I'm a Cheerleader — 32% difference between critics (42%) and audiences (74%).\n\n4. King Kong — 34% difference between critics (84%) and audiences (50%).\n\n5. Antz — 40% difference between critics (92%) and audiences (52%).\n\n6. The Witch — 31% difference between critics (90%) and audiences (59%).\n\n7. Hotel Transylvania — 27% difference between critics (45%) and audiences (72%).\n\n8. Venom — 50% difference between critics (30%) and audiences (80%).\n\n9. Ad Astra — 43% difference between critics (83%) and audiences (40%).\n\n10. Uncut Gems — 40% difference between critics (92%) and audiences (52%).\n\n11. Spy Kids — 47% difference between critics (93%) and audiences (46%).\n\n12. It Comes at Night — 43% difference between critics (87%) and audiences (44%).\n\n13. Harlem Nights — 55% difference between critics (25%) and audiences (80%).\n\n14. Grown Ups — 51% difference between critics (11%) and audiences (62%).\n\n15. Joker — 20% difference between critics (68%) and audiences (88%).\n\n16. Transformers — 27% difference between critics (58%) and audiences (85%).\n\n17. Noah — 35% difference between critics (76%) and audiences (41%).\n\n18. The Informant! — 35% difference between critics (79%) and audience (44%).\n\n19. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water — 27% difference between critics (81%) and audience (54%).\n\n20. Playing With Fire — 53% difference between critics (24%) and audience (77%).\n\n21. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull — 25% difference between critics (78%) and audience (53%).\n\n22. Drag Me to Hell — 30% difference between critics (92%) and audience (62%).\n\n23. Twilight — 23% difference between critics (49%) and audience (72%).\n\nCan you think of any other movies like these that seemed to split critics and audiences? Comment below!\n\nShare This Article"
