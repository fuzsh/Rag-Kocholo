        "text": "(Photo by Tidepoint Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)\n\nThe Best Japanese Horror Movies\n\nFrom folk tales to body horror to monster movies, Japan’s cinema finds new ways to thrill and disturb audiences. Japanese horror movies got a big leg-up in the 1950s and 1960s with Ugetsu and Kwaidan, before spinning heads over time with transgressive cult works (Tetsuo: The Ironman), comedic takes (Hausu, One Cut of the Dead), and crossover hits (Ringu, Audition). And we’d be remiss to not include at least the original kaiju movie, Godzilla. It was created in response to nuclear oblivion, and creating art to process real trauma is one of the core values of horror.\n\nAnd now we’ve gathered every Japanese horror movie with a Fresh rating and ranked them by Tomatometer, creating your guide to the best Japanese horror movies of all time.\n\n#1\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 104681%\n\nCritics Consensus: Brainy and bloody in equal measure, One Cut of the Dead reanimates the moribund zombie genre with a refreshing blend of formal daring and clever satire.\n\nSynopsis: Real zombies attack a hack director and a film crew who are shooting a low budget zombie film in an...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Ishirô Honda\n\n#4\n\nCure (1997) 94%\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 97930%\n\nCritics Consensus: Mesmerizing and psychologically intriguing.\n\nSynopsis: \"Cure\" is part atmospheric crime film and part philosophical meditation. Detective Takabe (Koji Yakusho) is tracking a series of identical... [More]\n\nDirected By: Kiyoshi Kurosawa\n\n#5\n\nKwaidan (1964) 91%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 95729%\n\nCritics Consensus: Exquisitely designed and fastidiously ornate, Masaki Kobayashi's ambitious anthology operates less as a frightening example of horror and more as a meditative tribute to Japanese folklore.\n\nSynopsis: Taking its title from an archaic Japanese word meaning \"ghost story,\" this anthology adapts four folk tales. A penniless samurai... [More]\n\nDirected By: Masaki Kobayashi\n\n#6\n\nHouse (1977) 91%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 95165%\n\nCritics Consensus: House is a gleefully demented collage of grand guginol guffaws and bizarre sequences.\n\nSynopsis: In an effort to avoid spending time with her father and his creepy new lover, young Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami) resolves... [More]\n\nDirected By: Nobuhiko Ôbayashi\n\n#7\n\nShin Godzilla (2016) 86%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 88890%\n\nCritics Consensus: Godzilla Resurgence offers a refreshingly low-fi -- and altogether entertaining -- return to the monster's classic creature-feature roots.\n\nSynopsis: A mysterious monster emerges from Tokyo Bay and wreaks havoc upon Japan.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Hideaki Anno, Shinji Higuchi\n\n#8\n\nThree... Extremes (2005) 86%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 87658%\n\nCritics Consensus: This anthology contains brutal, powerful horror stories by three of Asia's top directors.\n\nSynopsis: Stories revolve around a witch doctor, a filmmaker (Lee Byung-hun) and a resentful extra, and a novelist and her twin... [More]\n\n#9\n\nAudition (1999) 83%\n\n#9\n\nAdjusted Score: 86750%\n\nCritics Consensus: An audacious, unsettling Japanese horror film from director Takashi Miike, Audition entertains as both a grisly shocker and a psychological drama.\n\nSynopsis: This disturbing Japanese thriller follows Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), a widower who decides to start dating again.
