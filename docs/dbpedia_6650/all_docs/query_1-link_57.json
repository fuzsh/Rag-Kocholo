        "text": "What is Japanese Culture Like?\n\nThis post about Japanese culture and traditions is brought to you by Samurai Ninja Museum Tokyo With Experience\n\nJapanese culture is a set of values that puts importance on social harmony and hard work. Up until the 10th century, Japanese culture was similar to the Chinese culture, but the rise of the samurai in the Heian Period and the isolation during the Edo Period changed the rules of society. Overall, the culture was influenced by the local Shinto religion, Buddhism, Confucianism and the limited natural resources.\n\nWhile Japanese lifestyle has been Westernized recently, Japanese people still do everything possible to preserve their rich cultural heritage by practicing tea ceremony, wearing kimono and studying traditional arts and crafts from early childhood.\n\nJapan's Customs and Traditions\n\nSince harmony is very important in Japan, there are many customs, traditions and etiquette rules to create social bonding between people. Some of the interesting traditions that surprise foreigners are:\n\nTaking off shoes when entering someone’s house\n\nWearing a mask when sick\n\nNot shaking hands and not hugging when meeting with loved ones\n\nBowing 45 degrees to show respect\n\nMaking the slurping sound when eating noodles\n\nSymbolically washing hands when entering a shrine\n\nWearing slippers when using the restroom\n\nDecorate one's house with dolls for the annual “girls day” and decorate the house with the samurai figure for the annual “boys day”\n\nThrowing beans at people who dressed as demons during the \"setsubun\" festival\n\nEating a special meal called \"osechi\" during the new year's day\n\nBathing in the evening rather than in the morning\n\nParticipating in the firework festivals or bon odori festivals during the summer by wearing a yukata.\n\nYou can find out hundreds of Japanese customs and the rules of the etiquette here.\n\nSome Basics of Japanese Culture\n\nJapanese people always display modesty and humility. People often bow to convey the message: “I am not above you. I respect you.” Bowing longer with a higher degree of angle means more respect. Additionally, Japanese people have two religions at the same time: they are both Buddhist and Shintoist. When a Japanese baby is born, the ceremony is held in the Shinto shrine and when someone dies the ceremony takes place in a Buddhist temple. Lastly, in Japan, people are obsessed with hygiene: they take off their shoes when entering someone's house and take a bath almost everyday. Many foreigners are surprised that there are no trash cans in public areas but everywhere is still clean.\n\nFestivals in Japanese Culture\n\nThere are relatively a higher number of festivals in Japan compared to other countries because Japanese religions are related to celebrating the harvest seasons and seasonal changes. Each of the 47 Japanese prefectures has a different festival which usually takes place in the summer. Locals usually participate in these festivals by wearing a yukata and sandals. The most famous Japanese festivals are:\n\nGion Festival in Kyoto. The largest parade in Japan which started in the 800’s when there was an epidemic similar to the Coronavirus.\n\nAwa Odori Festival in Tokushima. A Dance festival held during the Obon-Week (the week when the spirits of the deceased are believed to visit the world).\n\nNebuta Festival in Aomori. A festival dedicated to ancient warriors in Northern Japan.\n\nHolidays and Celebrations in Japanese Culture\n\nIf you look at the Japanese calendar, you would notice that there is a major cultural celebration almost every month. Japanese people like celebrating seasonal changes to show their appreciation of new beginnings. The three most important celebrations in Japan are:\n\n1) The new year's day. Japanese people visit a shrine after the midnight on Dec 31 to make a wish.\n\n2) Cherry blossom celebrations in April. It is a custom to have a picnic under the cherry trees.\n\n3) The Obon Holiday in August. Japanese people visit their hometown to commemorate the spirits of those who passed away.\n\nJapan has a beautiful culture where hard work, respect to the elderly and politeness are some of the most important things in life. But after WW2 some new laws were enacted and there are now differences between old traditions and new traditions.\n\nEtiquette in Japanese Culture\n\nSince Japanese people believe individuals are less important than the group, everyone strictly follows the rules of the etiquette. Some of the most common etiquette social faux pas foreigners make in Japan are:\n\nSpeaking on the phone while riding a train\n\nNot returning a personal favor by gifting a box of sweets\n\nEating something while walking or eating something on the train\n\nTaking or giving something by only using one hand\n\nShowing up for a meeting just in time (People are supposed to come to meetings 5-10 minutes earlier, NOT at the exact beginning time)\n\nPassing food to someone by using chopsticks (this act is a reminder of funerals)\n\nNot taking off shoes when entering someone’s house\n\nWriting someone’s name in red ink\n\nGiving white or yellow Chrysanthemum flowers to someone who is sick (this act is a reminder of funerals)\n\nNot showering before entering a hot spring\n\nYou can find out hundreds of Japanese customs and the rules of the etiquette here.\n\nFood in Japanese Culture\n\nThe staple food in Japan is rice, not bread. In the past, the tax was collected as rice and samurais’ salary was paid in rice. Japanese people believe rice is healthier than wheat which has more carbs and is more difficult to digest. Up until the 19th century, the Japanese rarely ate meat because of Buddhism which bans eating animals. For the same reason, they also did not consume dairy, that is why some Japanese tend to be lactose intolerant. Fresh sushi is the most popular food throughout Japan even though it used to be the cheap fast-food for workers in the 1800's. Nowadays, a typical Japanese breakfast consists of fried fish and miso soup while a typical lunch is ramen noodles or rice bowl with deep fried meat.\n\nClothing in Japanese Culture - Kimono\n\nTraditionally, Japanese people wear a one-piece garment called kimono which emerged during the Heian Period (794-1185). Kimono is made out of silk and each motif has a meaning. Cranes represent longevity; pine-trees represent the new year; the Chrysanthemum flower represents the imperial family. The summer kimono is called “yukata” and the wedding kimono is called “uchikake.” Kimonos usually have long sleeves for wind to pass through and cool down the body. While children wear kimono with bright colors and flower designs, the elderly wear simple kimonos with simple motifs. Nowadays, Japanese people wear Western clothes at work and school but prefer kimono for social occasions and ceremonies.\n\nArts in Japanese Culture\n\nJapanese arts can be traced back to the indigenous populations who roamed the main island thousands of years ago. The pottery vessels made by the “Jomon” 12,000 years ago are considered as the oldest in the world. Later, the Japanese arts were influenced by Buddhism and Chinese culture. The earliest forms of Buddhist statues and monochrome paintings at temples show resemblance to the Chinese arts. However, many unique forms of art, such as ikebana, ukiyo-e and kabuki, started emerging when the influence of China started diminishing after the rise of the samurai class in the 10th century.\n\nAesthetics in Japanese Culture\n\nJapanese arts were influenced by Zen Buddhism where minimalism, modesty and simplicity are very important. The perception of beauty is different from the ideal beauty concept in the West. Japanese artisans believe things that are old, asymmetrical and natural are more aesthetically appealing than perfectly symmetrical new objects. Silence, open space, elegant simplicity and rustic patina are always visible in all aspects of Japanese arts.\n\nValues in Japanese Culture\n\nJapan is a conformist society where harmony, mutual respect and group consensus are valued. Other values such as collectiveness, diligence and conflict avoidance are actually the results of the need for social harmony. Japanese religion also has an influence on common Japanese values. The values of purity and cleanliness come from Shintoism while perfectionism and minimalism come from zen Buddhism. Additionally, the spread of East Asian teachings in Japan may have affected the culture. It is said that the values of long term thinking, perseverance, respect for social hierarchy and respect for the elderly come from Confucianism.\n\nCommunication in Japanese Culture\n\nJapanese communication style is very unique mostly because Japan was isolated to the outer world between the 16th and 19th centuries. There also was hierarchy, similar like the Caste system in India, where the elite samurai were on top and those who took care of dead animals were at the bottom. It was very costly to become an outcast in this closely-knit hierarchical society, so people were careful not offending others.\n\nOne of the most unique aspects of Japanese communication style is the lack of rejection. Japanese people rarely use the word “no” because rejecting someone is considered as a sign of disrespect. Because of the same reason, Japanese people use symbolism and usually make a request indirectly so that the other side doesn’t have to feel the pressure. When it comes to writing, Japanese people express their ideas less clearly. Westerners usually clearly state the most important point at the beginning or ending of an essay but Japanese people vaguely mention the important point somewhere in the middle.\n\nReligion in Japanese Culture\n\nThere are two dominant religions in Japan: Shinto and Buddhism. Neither of them has a clear definition of God and the judgment day. Shintoism does not even have any holy book or the concept of sin. So, in a Western sense, Japanese religions are more like traditions rather than holy belief systems. Shintoism is Japan’s own religion where some natural objects are considered sacred but not necessarily worshipped as gods. Buddhism proposes that everyone can become a Buddha (the enlightened human) if he/she leaves worldly desires and lives a simple life. Japanese people traditionally go to both Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines; so they are both Shintoist and Buddhist.\n\nSymbols in Japanese Culture\n\nJapan has an indirect communication style, so there are many symbols in everyday life. Some of the Japanese symbols and their meanings are 1- Salt: Purity 2- Crane: Longevity 3- Sakura: Beautiful things don’t last long 4- Carp: Perseverance 5- Red Gate: The door to the sacred world 6- Dragon: Strength 7- Chrysanthemum flower: Imperial family 8- Japanese flag: The Sun 9- Round Circle: Universe 10- Beckoning Cat: Good fortune & money.\n\nJapanese literature\n\nJapanese literature refers to the written materials produced by Japanese authors in the past. The two most well-known Japanese literary works are “the tale of genji,” and “haiku” poems. The tale of Genji is a novel written in the 11th century which is sometimes called the world’s first novel. It is a story about a prince who was kicked out of the imperial family and had love affairs among commoners. Haiku is the name given to minimalistic poems that consist of three phrases uttered in 17 syllabi (5-7-5). The topic is usually about seasonal changes and the phrase in the middle connects two distant concepts. Recently, Haruki Murakami became famous for his novels based on strange characters and absurd moments of life. His style is considered Western but his novels still reflect everyday life in Japan.\n\nFolk Stories and Heroes in Japanese Culture\n\nJapanese folklore and folktales are heavily influenced by Chinese culture and collective norms of the isolated Japanese islands. The Short stories and folk tales always try to teach the importance of patience, honesty, and hard work. The stories usually include 1- Old grandpa and grandma 2- A strong little boy 3- A beautiful little girl who grows up to be a princess 4- Devil (Oni) 5- Samurai. Samurais usually cooperate with the protagonist. 6- Forest 7- An animal that turns out to be a human or a creature with supernatural powers. The most famous children story is perhaps Momotaro (the peach boy). An old woman finds a tiny boy inside the seed of a peach. The little boy grows up by eating the dumplings made by the old lady. He then goes to the demons' island and retrieves the treasures stolen by the demons. He gets help from 3 animals during his fight agains the demons: a monkey, a dog and a bird.\n\nJapanese Mythology and Legends\n\nThe most popular Japanese myths are about how Japanese islands were created and how the emperor of Japan was ascended to the world. These myths were originally mentioned in Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, the first history books written in Japanese around the 8th century. According to the legend, the islands of Japan were created by 2 divine gods Izanami and Izanagi who were siblings. Izanagi later gave birth to 3 gods including the Sun God Amaterasu. The grandson of Ameterasu turned into a human being and ascended to the world. That person was Gimmu, the first emperor of Japan. There are many gods in Japanese mythology but the sun god Amaterasu is the most important god and her 3 sacred belongings (the mirror, jewel and sword) are still kept by the imperial family today.\n\nCreatures and Monsters in Japanese Culture\n\nIn Japanese folklore, monsters, demons and supernatural creatures are usually called “youkai” or “akuma”. Their origins go back to the creation legends of Shinto and the Buddhist beliefs. You can also think of them as evil characters in folk stories. The three most commonly known “youkai” characters are\n\n1- Tengu: It has a distinctive long nose. It is not always evil; Tengu is also known as the protective demon of Buddhist temples.\n\n2- Yuki Onna: The snow woman with long dark hair wearing a white dress. More common in stories from Northern Japan.\n\n3- Hitotsume Kozo: A one-eyed bald child in folk stories.\n\nJapanese Beliefs and Concepts\n\nMottai Nai: Nothing should be wasted, nothing should be thrown away.\n\nWabi Sabi: Things that are old and natural are more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nShibumi: Simple is the best.\n\nMono-no-aware: It is the reality of life that beautiful things in our lives don’t last forever.\n\nKaizen: Continuous improvement. Things are never perfect, we should keep improving.\n\nJohakyu: Slow start and sudden finish. Many Japanese movies follow this structure.\n\nOmote nashi: Serve your guests from the heart.\n\nZen: Simple actions in our lives lead to awakening of our spirits.\n\nJapanese Proverbs\n\nIsogeba maware: If you are trying to take a shortcut, you are likely to make a mistake.\n\nRyouyaku wa kuchi ni nigashi: Good medicine usually tastes bitter.\n\nFukusui bon ni kaerazu: If something is done, there is no going back\n\nUeni mo ue ga aru: Even the top has a top.\n\nShitashiki naka nimo reigi ari: Even among friends, you should follow the etiquette\n\nNanakorobi yaoki: Even if you fall 7 times, you must stand up for your 8th challenge.\n\nDeru Kui Utareru: Those who are different get hammered down.\n\nTaisetsuno koto ha meni mienain da: Important things are not visible to the eye.\n\nSaru mo ki kara ochiru: Even monkeys fall from trees. It is natural to make mistakes.\n\nHana yori dango: Instead of appearance you should care about substance.\n\nJapanese Superstitions\n\nJapanese people believe that breaking a comb brings bad luck.\n\nIn Japanese language the number 4 sounds the same with “death” so many buildings do not have the 4th floor (4th floor is simply called 5th floor).\n\nIn Japan people don’t whistle at night because it may bring out snakes.\n\nSeeing a spider in the morning brings good luck. Killing a spider in the morning brings bad luck.\n\nIf you hear a crow’s caw it brings bad luck. If you take a rest after eating you may become a pig.\n\nCutting fingernails at night sets a curse on your family.\n\nSleeping by facing north brings bad luck because only at the funeral house the deceased faces north.\n\nArchitecture in Japanese Culture\n\nJapanese architecture is similar to that of other East Asian countries. Japanese buildings tend to be simple with dull colors as a result of the zen philosophy. The temples, shrines and private houses are traditionally made out of wood. Most structures have elevated basements and big roofs because of high humidity and frequent rains throughout the year. The roofs also have curves at the corners that provide more light in the winter and more shadow during the winter. Rooms are separated by light wooden screens (fusuma) or paper windows (shoji) that can be easily moved when seasons change. Visitors of Japan are surprised by the green mats set on floors (tatami) which are made out of plant straws.\n\nGardens in Japanese Culture\n\nJapanese gardens are considered as the miniature versions of vast landscapes. Rocks symbolize mountains, bushes represent forests and ponds are reference seas and lakes. There are three main types of Japanese gardens: pond garden, rock garden and the courtyard garden. The pond garden is the most popular type of Japanese garden adopted from Chinese culture. The rock garden (karesansui), also known as the zen garden, consists of white pebbles and stones often found in zen monasteries in Kyoto. The courtyard garden (tsubo niwa) is a miniature garden built inside traditional houses. The courtyard garden is usually located in the middle of a house to get more sunshine indoors and help the residents feel like living in nature.\n\nTea Ceremony in Japanese Culture\n\nJapanese tea ceremony is preparing and drinking matcha tea in a ceremonial way by using traditional utensils. The purpose of Japanese tea ceremony is to create bonding between the host and guest and also gain inner peace in our busy daily lives. Japanese people consider tea ceremony very important because it was started by the elite zen monks and practiced by noble warlords for most of history. During the ceremony, the participants practice silence, respect, mindfulness and symbolic purification. While some Japanese perform tea ceremony as just a hobby today, most people consider it as a form of traditional arts and call it the art of tea.\n\nSumo Wrestling in Japanese Culture\n\nSumo wrestling emerged as a shinto ceremony to entertain gods. People believed that if the gods were not pleased, they would not bring a good harvest season. That is why, the sumo stage, dohyo, has been considered very sacred. On the ceiling of the sumo wrestling ring, there is usually a roof of a shinto shrine. The wrestlers throw salt on to the stage for symbolic purification and do irregular warm up routines to scare evil spirits away. The rounds usually last only 20-30 seconds and If the round takes more than 4 minutes the referee asks for a break.The sumo wrestlers usually eat a high-calorie dish called “chanko nabe” which is beef stew and vegetables hot pot. Young sumo wrestlers consume around 20,000 calories of food a day. That is why they can get fat so easily and quickly.\n\nMartial Arts in Japanese Culture\n\nThe focus of martial arts is not beating the enemy but building a strong personality and character. Japanese people believe martial arts should be used for self-defense only. Most Japanese policemen practice Aikido to catch criminals. While Karate, judo and Aikido emerged in the 19th century, the samurai class practiced martial arts in the past for unarmed combat. There are so many different types of martial arts in Japan including kyudo, ninjutsu, kendo, jujitsu, naginatajutsu and etc.. These are the principles of martial arts in Japanese culture a) “Dojo” is a sacred place, it must be clean, safe and quiet b) Students can only learn by watching the “sensei” c) Mental strength is more important than body strength d) Cleaning the “dojo” is part of the training e) Show respect to your opponent at all times f) You must memorize “kata”: simulated defense moves g) Junior members must follow and obey senior members.\n\nGeisha in Japanese Culture\n\nGei-sha means the person of art. The first geisha to appear were men who entertained groups of people enjoying parties. The apprentice geisha is called maiko when she has to live in the geisha lodging house for 5 years without using a cell phone and seeing her family only once a month. Professional geishas know all major Japanese cultural traditions and arts including tea ceremony, ikebana flower arrangement, Japanese buyou dance, shamisen playing, Japanese calligraphy and etc.. The most popular geisha neighborhoods are located in Kyoto where watching a private geisha dance performance may cost up to $5000 a night. Geishas’ silk kimonos and jewelry are also very expensive, costing more than a typical employee’s annual salary.\n\nJapanese Popular Culture & Modern Japanese Culture\n\nMost people associate modern Japanese culture with manga, anime. Manga and anime are not the same things. Manga is the Japanese word for printed comics although nowadays most people read them online. Anime is Japanese abbreviation for animated comics. Japanese anime market is estimated to be worth $20 billion, higher than the $4 billion manga market. The anime titled “Sazae-san” is the world’s longest lasting cartoon with more than 7400 episodes. Contrary to the common belief, the eyes of the manga characters are big not because Japanese want to have big eyes but because big eyes appear more appealing in general. Did you know that in Japan there is more paper used for manga books compared to toilet paper?\n\nKawaii in Japanese Culture\n\nKawaii simply means “cute” but this word is commonly used in various occasions especially by the young generation. In Japan, anything that is smaller than the original version can be called kawaii. However if a small thing is harmful (example: snake) it may not be called kawaii. The children, pet animals and tiny decorative items are always referred to as kawaii. You are supposed to call a baby “kawaii,” whether the baby is cute or not.\n\nJapanese hobbies and Games\n\nThe most popular hobby in Japan is to travel as people love traveling domestically and internationally. Other three common leisure activities are karaoke, shogi and kendama. Kara-oke means empty orchestra. Even though karaoke was born in Kobe city of Japan, there are more than 100,000 karaoke venues all around the world. Shogi means general’s board game. It is similar to chess and consists of a wooden board and 40 pentagon-shaped pieces. Kendama is a popular cup-and-ball game among teenagers. The purpose is to put the ball at the end of the string into the cup without touching it.\n\nJapanese Performing Arts\n\nThe top 3 most common Japanese performing arts are Kabuki, the Noh performance and the Bunraku puppet theater. Kabuki was born next to the Kamo River in Kyoto where female entertainers performed plays. During the Edo Period, Kabuki actors probably were the most famous people in the country whose images were widely distributed by Ukiyo-e prints. The red color on the face represents anger and the black color represents fear. Noh is a slow-paced dance-drama which is a combination of folk dance and the Shinto rituals. The topic is usually how a supernatural being turns into a human. Bunraku is the traditional puppet theater where puppeteers cover all of their body with black fabric to make themselves invisible.\n\nJapanese Music & Music Instruments\n\nDuring the Heian period, the music entertainment was very important for the court nobilities. The three musical instruments that existed back then were the lute (also known as biwa in Japanese), the Asian stringed instrument named “koto” and the big Japanese drum called taiko. Taiko was also used in battles by the samurai to communicate with clan leaders and intimidate the enemy. During the peace period shamisen became popular. Shamisen is the Japanese guitar played in kabuki and bunraku performances. Traditionally the strings of shamisen were made out of silk and the body is covered by snake skin or cat skin. The most well-known Japanese folk song is called sakura-sakura which talks about how beautiful the feeling of the cherry blossom in Japan is.\n\nSamurai in Japanese Culture\n\nSamurai means “the one who serves the master.”Although the samurai were the elite warrior class, the meaning of the word is not warrior.In the past, there was a social hierarchy in Japan and the samurai class was on the top of the chain. Commoners had to bow in front of the samurai and avoid eye-contact. The samurai used to follow the code called “Bushido.” Bushido consisted of 7 values including courage, respect, honor and loyalty. It is said that most Japanese people do not change jobs and work so hard for their companies as a result of the “Bushido” culture. Japanese companies usually do not advertise against their competitors because of the “respect the enemy” rule in the samurai culture.\n\nNinja in Japanese Culture\n\nIn Japanese, ninja are usually called “shinobi” which means spy. Ninja were most active in the 1600s and 1700s being hired as spies and assassins for the daimyos. There were only 2 regions in Japan, Iga and Koga, where people could become a ninja. Although their image is usually associated by assassination, most of the time they were spies who could walk very silently, run very fast and make poisons and explosives. Since the ninja could not own horses and did not carry swords, they had to run so fast in order to survive. Some ninjas could run more than 50km in one day. They also did not wear black uniforms and preferred casual clothes as they did not want to stand out as a spy.\n\nFuroshiki Cloth Wrapping\n\nJapanese cloth wrapping is called furoshiki, and is the act of wrapping important items in Japanese cloth. This traditional craft emerged as a way to preserve old fabrics and utilize them in a practical way. Furoshiki is a good example of Japan’s “mottai-i nai” concept which means nothing should be wasted. Some furoshiki wraps look like baskets, bags or even more complex designs! Furoshiki has become very popular in Japan and overseas as wrapping items such as gifts has been seen as trendy and eco-friendly.\n\nJapanese Calligraphy - Shodo\n\nThere are 3 different alphabets in Japanese which are hiragana (46 characters), Katakana (46 characters) and Kanji (approx. 20,000 characters). Japanese calligraphy, shodo, is the art of writing these Japanese characters in an aesthetically pleasing way. The samurai often practiced calligraphy especially during the Edo period. The four stages of Japanese calligraphy are: 1- Perfect Concentration 2- Continuity 3- Appreciation of Beauty 4- Formation of human character. One of the most surprising things about Japanese calligraphy is the brush. The best brushes are usually made out of horsehair. The weasel-hair brush would be ideal to make thinner lines but it tends to be expensive.\n\nOrigami\n\nOrigami is possibly the most well-known of all of Japan’s cultural activities. This is practiced as an art where paper is folded to create a range of shapes including animals, flowers or people. Japanese children learn origami at elementary school to improve their focusing skills and understand the importance of following the instructions to reach an ultimate goal.This is one of the best family activities for travelers visiting Japan where the members can learn from and compete against each other and keep the paper figure they make.\n\nKintsugi\n\nThe Japanese have an art form called Kintsugi, which translates as “golden joinery.” It is a rather unusual practice involving mending broken pottery with lacquer mixed with powdered precious metals. The philosophy behind Kintsugi is similar to wabi-sabi, which teaches appreciation of the imperfect things in the world. Instead of discarding damaged objects, Japanese people often repair them and use them for centuries. This art also represents appreciating our scars and failures.\n\nOnsen - Japanese Hot Springs\n\nOnsen means hot spring in Japanese. As a volcanic island Japan has more than 3000 hot springs.
