        "text": "The past few years have been great for Japanese films. Excellent films like Godzilla Minus One, Suzume and Perfect Days have reignited interest abroad in the Japanese film industry. Japan is the world’s fourth-largest film producer and third-largest box office. With over 100 years of film history, Japan has one of the oldest film industries in the world. With such a long history and so many films, it can be intimidating to delve into the rich cinematic landscape of Japan. However, from comedy to drama to horror, many Japanese films are must-watches. Japan has also produced some of the most influential directors of all time, from Akira Kurosawa to Hayao Miyazaki. The greatest Japanese movies of all time are the perfect introduction to this impressive and historic industry, and are not to be missed by anyone interested in international cinema.\n\nTop Japanese Movies\n\nWhen the newly invented kinetoscope was shown in Japan in 1896, a new way of telling stories was introduced to an island nation with a rich history of storytelling. Japan’s film industry quickly took off and started to establish itself. In the following decades, Japan became known for Jidaigeki (period dramas that show Japan pre-Meiji restoration), monster movies, animes, samurai films and beautifully shot slow-paced dramas. However, there is also so much more.\n\nMany of the top-grossing Japanese films are animated, including the top-grossing Japanese film (both in Japan and Worldwide), 2020’s Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba—The Movie: Mugen Train. The highest-grossing live-action film, Bayside Shakedown 2, only comes in seventh in Japan and fifteenth worldwide. This list thus looks at both animated and non-animated films. It considers the history of Japanese cinema but prioritizes the craft and quality of the films themselves. It is also a Western perspective from a writer who doesn’t speak Japanese. However, it hopes to capture the classics and greatest movies of Japan’s impressive film industry.\n\n30. Ring (1998)\n\nRing or Ringu (as it was released in North America) helped popularize and establish J-Horror internationality. While American audiences are probably more familiar with its 2002 American remake, The Ring, the original is well worth a watch.\n\nRing was a box-office success and critically acclaimed upon its release. Much like the American version, the film follows a reporter uncovering the story behind a cursed videotape that causes people to die seven days after watching it. The film not only popularized Japanese horror in the West but also revived horror filmmaking in Japan, leading to films like Pulse, The Grudge and Dark Water. With more recent releases like One Cut to the Dead and Tag, Japanese horror continues to shine. Ring is currently streaming on Tubi.\n\n29. Paprika (2006)\n\nThe last film by acclaimed anime auteur Satoshi Kon, Paprika, follows a dream detective pursuing a terrorist with a device that can influence people’s dreams. Many have noted how similar Paprika is to the American film Inception. However, Christopher Nolan has not cited the film as an influence even though the two films share many plot elements and themes.\n\nNolan wouldn’t be the first American director to possibly find inspiration in Kon’s work. Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream has been noted as very similar to another of Kon’s works, Perfect Blue. Paprika currently holds an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes and is currently streaming on Tubi.\n\n28. House (1977)\n\nHouse, directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi, is the most experimental film on this list. The horror-comedy follows a young girl and her friends as they journey to an ailing aunt’s country home, only to be devoured by the house itself.\n\nThe film was initially poorly reviewed, but it did well at the box office in Japan. It became a cult classic abroad once released in America in the late 2000s. The film combines live action, animation and stop motion for a groundbreaking cinematic style. Sarah Cleary for The BFI said of the film, “Like many a good ghost story, House reflects the ways in which past events can reverberate into the present and, on some level, this is a story about seven happy-go-lucky teenagers being starkly confronted with the wartime trauma their parents’ generation endured.” House is currently streaming on Max.\n\n27. Shall We Dance? (1996)\n\nNot to be confused with the American remake of the same name, Shall We Dance? is a rom-com about a middle-aged accountant who signs up for dance classes to escape his mundane life.\n\nDirected by Masayuki Suo, the film was a box-office success both in Japan and America. Roger Ebert said of the film, “[it is] one of the more completely entertaining movies I've seen in a while—a well-crafted character study that, like a Hollywood movie with a skillful script, manipulates us but makes us like it.” The film is unfortunately not available on streaming in America.\n\n26. Battle Royale (2000)\n\nThe last film by Kinji Fukasaku, Battle Royale, walks the line between being a horror and action film. The movie is bombastic, gory and high-octane. It follows 42 teens left on a deserted island and forced to fight before the last survivor is allowed to leave.\n\nThe film is a favorite of directors like Quentin Tarantino and helped establish the “battle royale genre.” While the film is considered a cult classic in America, it was a box-office success in Japan and abroad. The film was banned in several countries and not distributed in America due to fear of legal concerns. However, it was finally distributed in America in 2010. Battle Royale is currently streaming for free on Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel and Amazon Prime.\n\n25. Your Name (2016)\n\nYour Name is an anime about two students who swap bodies during the lead-up to a rare comet. The film was popular both in Japan and abroad, and Japan’s Toho Studios is reportedly working on a live-action version.\n\nYour Name has a little bit of everything: romance, comedy, heartbreak, a great twist, a catchy soundtrack and a surprising depth. Without giving too much away, the film balances puppy love and the cultural memory of natural disasters. The film currently holds a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently available to stream on Crunchy Roll.\n\n24. The Twilight Samurai (2002)\n\nDirected by Yoji Yamada and starring Hiroyuki Sanada and Rie Miyazawa, The Twilight Samurai follows a low-level samurai working as a bookkeeper whose sleepy life is disrupted when a woman from his past arrives in town.\n\nThe film is slow-moving and muted. It takes place a few years before the Meiji Restoration and thus takes a different approach to the “samurai story” shown in many other Jidaigeki films. The Twilight Samurai won 12 Japanese Academy Awards and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Unfortunately, it is currently not available for streaming.\n\n23. Woman in the Dunes (1964)\n\nSometimes called Sand Woman, Woman in the Dunes is a New Wave thriller about an amateur entomologist who arrives in a village and begins to live with a widow at the bottom of a sand dune.\n\nConsidered director Hiroshi Teshigahara’s masterpiece, the film stars Eiji Okada and Kyōko Kishida. The film was nominated for two Oscars and won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Roger Ebert said of the film in a 1998 review, “There has never been sand photography like this (no, not even in \"Lawrence of Arabia\"), and by anchoring the story so firmly in this tangible physical reality, the cinematographer, Hiroshi Segawa, helps the director pull off the difficult feat of telling a parable as if it is really happening.” The film is available to rent on Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\n22. Tampopo (1985)\n\nSometimes comedy doesn’t translate well. However, Tampopo’s light and humanistic approach to comedy transcends language barriers. The film follows a delivery man and a ramen shop owner as they search for the perfect noodle.\n\nDirected by Juzo Itami, the film stars Tsutomu Yamazaki, Nobuko Miyamoto and Ken Watanabe. It is pure, sexy fun that will make audiences hungry for something more Eastern than a spaghetti western. The film currently holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. While Tampopo literally translates to “Dandelion” and in the movie refers to the Ramen chef’s first name, many restaurants have adopted the name due to the popularity of the film. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n21. Audition (1999)\n\nIf you have a weak stomach, don’t watch Audition. Takashi Miike’s horror classic is infamous for its final torture sequence, but the film is more profound than it sometimes gets credit for. Audition follows a widower who sets up fake film auditions to try to help him date again, but gets more than he bargained for when he chooses the beautiful yet quiet Asami.\n\nThe film influenced many horror directors and the so-called “torture porn” genre. However, unlike later films in the genre, like Saw or Hostel (which features a cameo from Miike), Audition is restrained in its use of gore. The film is more notable for its masterful use of tension. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n20. Akira (1988)\n\nAkira is an anime classic. Set in the dystopian future of 2019, the film follows the leader of a biker gang and his telekinetic friend during a rebellion in Neo-Tokyo.\n\nThe film features beautiful, if not strikingly violent, visuals and helped popularize anime films abroad. The film also popularized the “Akira slide,” a sliding motorcycle stop that is widely used in action and animated films. From the music to the action sequences, Akira is highly influential. Tom Usher wrote for Vice, “[Akira] was the first time the West had engaged with Japanese culture en-masse, and it made quite an impact: the film's influence is still apparent everywhere.” It is available to stream on Hulu.\n\n19. Tokyo Drifter (1966)\n\nDirected by Seijun Suzuki, Tokyo Drifter follows a former yakuza turned businessman who must outrun an old rival. The film walks the line between 1960s nostalgia and feeling extremely current. The visuals of this film and style make it well worth a watch.\n\nThe film is unapologetic in its B-movie status. Like many of Suzuki’s films, Tokyo Drifter is pure entertainment without pretension. The film currently holds 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n18. Tokyo Godfathers (2003)\n\nWritten and directed by Satoshi Kon, Tokyo Godfathers has a little bit of everything. It is a christmas movie, an amine, a tragicomedy and arguably a Yazuka film. The film follows three homeless people after they find a baby in the trash.\n\nWhile the subtitled version is recommended for most of the animes on this list, the most recent English dub is notable for having a trans actress, Shakina Nayfack, play the trans character of Hana (in the Japanese version, Hana is unfortunately voiced by a man). The film has gained a cult audience in the U.S. and currently has a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently streaming for free on The Roku Channel and Amazon Prime.\n\n17. Kwaidan (1964)\n\nWhile many of the films of prolific director Masaki Kobayashi could have made this list (and another one will), Kwaidan is among his most interesting. The film is a horror anthology and features four unrelated ghost stories.\n\nThe film is based on the Japanese folklore stories collected by Lafcadio Hearn, mainly his 1904 work Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things. While the film is a “horror movie,” its beauty detracts from its terror. It won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n16. The Tale of Princess Kaguya (2013)\n\nDirector Isao Takahata’s final film, The Tale of Princess Kaguya, is a retelling of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter from century-old folklore. The film is beautiful, though simply animated, breaking the usual maximal aesthetics of many other Studio Ghibli films.\n\nThe Tale of Princess Kaguya is the final film of Takeo Chii and also features Yukiji Asaoka in a special appearance. The film follows a bamboo cutter that finds a palm-sized girl inside of a glowing shoot. Until 2023’s The Boy and The Heron, The Tale of Princess Kaguya was the highest-budget film in Japanese history with around a $49 million budget. The film received universal acclaim and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars. The film's production also led to the documentary Isao Takahata and His Tale of Princess Kaguya. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is currently streaming on Max.\n\n15. Shoplifters (2018)\n\nHirokazu Kore-eda’s family crime drama Shoplifters was seemingly inspired by Japan’s real-life elder crime and shoplifting wave. The film follows a family who is forced to resort to shoplifting due to poverty in modern-day Tokyo.\n\nShoplifters premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d’Or. It went on to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars and Golden Globes. The film also won eight Japan Academy Prizes. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw initially rated the film four out of five stars, but revised it to five stars upon a second watch. He further said of the film, “Shoplifters is a complex, subtle, mysterious film that builds to the most extraordinary surprise ending, a twist-reveal worthy of psychological suspense noir.” It is currently streaming for free on Tubi and Peacock.\n\n14. Godzilla Minus One (2023)\n\nWhile other recent Godzilla films, such as Shin Godzilla, are great, Godzilla Minus One is arguably the best Godzilla movie made in years (and maybe ever?). Directed by Takashi Yamazaki, it is a sort of prequel to the original 1954 Godzilla. Minus One takes place in 1945 and follows an ex-kamikaze pilot who survives an incident with Godzilla only to find himself on a redemption arc, fighting the monster on the high seas.\n\nThe film was made on a smaller budget than the American Godzilla reboots and sequels but features just as good, if not better, special effects. It even won Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards. The film was praised both in Japan and America as a modern Godzilla masterpiece. The film currently holds a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was released on November 3 (the same date as the first Godzilla film's wide release in 1954) to celebrate the franchise’s 70th anniversary. It was also released in a black-and-white version as part of the celebration. It is currently available to stream on Netflix.\n\n13. Rashomon (1950)\n\nWritten and directed by Akira Kurosawa, Rashomon is an important film in movie history. The film inspired the narrative device, “The Rashomon Effect,” which describes the narrative use of differing perspectives on the same event. Rashomon is a Japanese period drama or Jidaigeki film that shows the same story of the rape of a bride and the murder of a samurai from several perspectives, including a thief, the bride, a woodcutter and the ghost of the samurai.\n\nKurosawa was already well-established in Japan; however, Rashomon was one of the first Japanese films to be critically celebrated abroad. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and an Academy Honorary Award at the Oscars (as it predated the Academy's International Film Category). The film currently has a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. It is currently available to stream for free on Tubi or with a subscription on Max.\n\n12. Godzilla (1954)\n\nWhile the first Godzilla film’s practical effects might seem a little cheesy to a modern audience, Godzilla is a must-watch. This film is a monster movie classic for a reason, and holds a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nDirected by Ishirō Honda, Godzilla, at its core, is about the dangers of nuclear bombs in post-WWII Japan. The movie follows the now-famous kaiju as his home and family are destroyed by an American hydrogen bomb, leading him to cause mayhem in Tokyo. The film is now part of a franchise with 38 films (33 of them Japanese). This film kicked off the Shōwa era of Godzilla films, which lasted until 1975 and included 15 films. Notably, Haruo Nakajima played the titular monster in a physical suit in many films of this period. Godzilla is currently available to stream for free on Tubi and Pluto TV or with a subscription on Max.\n\n11. Fireworks (1997)\n\nFireworks or Hana-Bi is a film by comedian turned-filmmaker Takeshi Kitano. The film follows an ex-cop after he borrows money from the mob and is pulled into crime in order to pay them back.\n\nFireworks was the most recent film included on legendary director Akira Kurosawa’s list of 100 favorite films. The film also won the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival. The film is masterfully crafted and in a 1998 review of the film, Roger Ebert said, “Not a frame, not a word, is excess.” The film is available to rent on YouTube and Google Play.\n\n10. My Neighbor Totoro (1988)\n\nThere are many films from Studio Ghibli and especially those by director Hayao Miyazaki could have occupied a space on this list. However, My Neighbor Totoro checks all the boxes that make Miyazaki films great including the dreamy magic of the countryside, the growth of childhood, environmentalism and the bonds of family.\n\nThe film follows two sisters who run into the spirit of the forest in 1950s rural Japan. While the 2004 English Dub is the easiest to find, the original 1989 English Dub is often preferred by fans especially of a certain age. Totoro, the titular spirit of the forest, has become a cultural icon and also serves as the mascot for Studio Ghibli. The film is available to stream on Max.\n\n9. Late Spring (1949)\n\nDirected by Yasujirō Ozu, Late Spring is the first part of Ozu’s \"Noriko trilogy,\" which also includes 1951’s Early Summer and 1953’s Tokyo Story. While the films are unconnected in plot, they each feature actress Setsuko Hara as an unmarried woman named Noriko and the theme of women’s lives in postwar Japan.\n\nThe film is a prime example of a shomin-geki film (a genre about the ordinary lives of ordinary people). It follows a woman and her widowed father as her aunt hatches a match-making plot. The film has a quiet and enduring sadness. Roger Ebert said of the film in 2005, “Late Spring tells a story that becomes sadder the more you think about it. There is a tension in the film between Noriko’s smile and her feelings.” The film is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n8. Drive My Car (2021)\n\nThere may be some recency bias with 2021’s Drive My Car; however, the film is a beautiful take on grief, love and the ordinary. It follows an aging actor-director and his young chauffeur as he struggles to overcome his grief over his wife’s death while directing a production of Uncle Vanya.\n\nThe film is based on the Haruki Murakami short story of the same name, and stars Hidetoshi Nishijima, Tōko Miura and Reika Kirishima. Drive My Car was the first Japanese film to receive a nomination for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, where it also won the Oscar for Best International Feature Film. The film became the first non-English-language film and one of only seven films to win Best Picture from all three major U.S. critics groups (LAFCA, NYFCC, NSFC). It is available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\n7. Ugetsu (1953)\n\nUgetsu is considered a masterpiece of Japan’s Golden Age of Cinema. The film tells the story of a hopeful samurai who leaves his wife and is then seduced by a ghost. While sometimes it is called a ghost story, it isn’t really a horror movie. Directed by the prolific filmmaker Kenji Mizoguchi, Ugetsu explores themes of lust, arrogance and women’s place in society.\n\nThe film won the Pasinetti Award and the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival before being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, Black and White. The film is available to stream on Tubi for free and Max with a subscription.\n\n6. Grave of the Fireflies (1988)\n\nOne of Studio Ghibli's darkest films and arguably one of the darkest animated films of all time, Grave of the Fireflies follows two children struggling to survive the horrors of war in 1940s Japan. Directed by Isao Takahata, Grave of the Fireflies was strangely shown initially as a double feature with the much lighter My Neighbor Totoro.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies is the only theatrical Studio Ghibli film before From Up on Poppy Hill in 2011 that Disney never had the North American distribution rights to, possibly because of how dark it is. However, it is still well worth a watch. Roger Ebert said Grave of the Fireflies is an \"emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation.\" Unfortunately, Grave of the Fireflies is currently unavailable to rent or stream in the US.\n\n5. Ikiru (1952)\n\nMany “best Japanese film lists” are dominated by director Akira Kurosawa. There is a reason for this, but with 30 films over a nearly 60-year career, it gets repetitive to sing his praises. That said, spots on this list could have been occupied by Kurosawa’s High and Low, Drunken Angel, Throne of Blood, The Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo or Ran. While Kurosawa is more remembered for his samurai and noir films, Ikiru is easily among his best.\n\nInspired by Tolstoy’s The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Ikiru follows a terminally ill bureaucrat on his final quest for meaning. The film stars Takashi Shimura and Miki Odagiri, and is surprisingly funny and deeply intimate. It was remade in Britain as 2022’s Living (“Ikiru” translates “To Live”), starring Bill Nighy. While Nighy’s performance is fabulous, Living falls short of the original film. Ikiru is currently streaming on Max.\n\n4. Tokyo Story (1953)\n\nYasujirō Ozu’s Tokyo Story is a masterpiece but possibly difficult to digest for both modern and international audiences. The film is slow and the camera barely moves. The film was even originally thought as \"too Japanese\" for international audiences. However, the it is a gorgeous and subtle drama about generational relations that is well worth a watch.\n\nStaring Chishū Ryū and Chieko Higashiyama, the film follows two aging parents as they visit their adult children in Tokyo. The film currently holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2012, Tokyo Story topped Sight and Sound’s list of Greatest Films of All Time. The film was remade by Yōji Yamada as 2013’s Tōkyō Kazoku. However, the original is superior. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi or Max with a subscription.\n\n3. Harakiri (1962)\n\nFresh off the also-iconic The Human Condition trilogy (1959–1961), director Masaki Kobayashi delivered another masterpiece in 1962’s Harakiri. The film is often cited as one of the best samurai films ever made. Harakiri follows a ronin during the Tokugawa shogunate who requests to commit a ritualized form of suicide called seppuku (or harakiri) at the manor of a local lord.\n\nThe film explores the themes of authority, power and glory. The film currently holds 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and is the highest-rated film on Letterboxd. The film also received the Special Jury Award at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. Takashi Miike’s 3-D remake Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai also premiered at Cannes in 2011; however, in this case, the original is better. 1962’s Harakiri is available to rent on Apple TV.\n\n2. Spirited Away (2001)\n\nSpirited Away is a Studio Ghibli film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. For 19 years, it held the record for highest-grossing film in Japan and was the first non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. (It was also the only one until another Miyazaki film, The Boy and the Heron, won in 2024.)\n\nThe film is one of the most beautifully animated films of all time. It follows a ten-year-old girl trapped in the spirit realm who must save her parents from an evil witch. While many Studio Ghibli films could have made this list, including Howl’s Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is arguably the studio’s best film. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n1. Seven Samurai (1954)\n\nAnother film by the legendary Akira Kurosawa, Seven Samurai, has been widely recognized as “the greatest foreign-language” film ever made. The film follows a group of farmers who hire samurai to protect their crops in the 1500s during Japan’s Sengoku period.\n\nThe film was a watershed moment for Japanese cinema and is still beloved today. The film has been a favorite of many directors, including Martin Scorsese and Andrei Tarkovsky. Seven Samurai has also widely inspired later films from 1960’s The Magnificent Seven to Star Wars to possibly Pixar’s A Bug’s Life. Seven Samurai’s “assembling a team” trope also influenced the genre of heist films. In 2016, Toho completed a 4K restoration of the film using second-generation fine-grain positive and third-generation duplicate negative elements. Unfortunately, the original negative of the film is lost. The 4K restoration is set to return to theaters in NYC and LA in July 2024. It is also currently streaming on Max.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFrom Japan’s Golden age of film in the 1950s to recent classics, there is so much to love about Japanese film. Whether you are looking for Samurais, Ghosts, daily life or animated classics, Japanese films have a lot to offer, and these 30 are the very best."
