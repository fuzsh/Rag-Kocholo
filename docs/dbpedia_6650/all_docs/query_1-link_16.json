        "text": "The French-Argentine director Gaspar Noé has built his career on the gleeful exploration of the fringes of human experience. Films like “Irreversible,” “Enter the Void” and the newly released “Love” plumb the depths of the uncanny, the impolite, the explicit — with an unflinching eye toward the human capacities for both care and cruelty. They are sometimes hard to watch, and always hard to forget. “Love” is no exception: Noé’s latest film centers on Murphy, an American living in Paris, and his erotically charged relationships; it features many minutes’ worth of unsimulated onscreen sex. (It was also filmed in 3D, and if there’s anything you’re imagining Noé might exploit that technology to depict, you’re probably right.) Here, Noé shares seven of the artworks, films and people who have influenced his work, from Buñuel to Travis Bickle.\n\n“2001: A Space Odyssey”\n\nJust like Murphy, the lead character of my most recent film, I’ve spent my whole life obsessed with this ultimate masterpiece, which is beyond cinema. I discovered it at the age of 7 with my parents on one of the biggest screens of Buenos Aires, and I’ve rewatched it every single year since. I’ve even spent some New Year’s Eves at home in front of my VHS/DVD/Blu-Ray players in order to make sure I’d start the year in the most positive and most valuable way. For years, this movie was a psychedelic maze to me. Then it turned into a puzzle, an object of desire, of addicition. I spent days searching for books or interviews that might explain to me how to solve the puzzle; then sleepless nights on my computer trying to find every single poster or lobby card of it in existance. And I’m still desperate to find the missing ones from Hong Kong, Pakistan and India. When you fall in love, you turn blind to the rest of the world. This movie almost turned me blind to the rest of cinema. I know it turned into some kind of mental disease, but I enjoy it as much as I enjoy directing. More than any other, this film pushed me to also try to become a Wizard of Oz.\n\nPierre Molinier\n\nA crazy, crazy, crazy photographer who wanted to be part of the French Surrealist movement, but who always scared them all. He did all kinds of photomontages of himself dressed as a woman, and his life was as strange as his work. He even decided many years in advance which exact day he would commit suicide. And the day he had announced, true to his word, he did it, leaving a note saying, “I hope the room is clean when you find me.” Oddly underestimated in the U.S., the Japanese love him."
