        "text": "01 of 25\n\nAlways Be My Maybe (2019)\n\nTwo old childhood friends reconnect in Always Be My Maybe, starring Ali Wong and Randall Park. As teens, the pair considered a romantic relationship, but it didn't work out. As adults, she's become a famous chef while he's still stuck in a small-time band and working for his dad's business. Now, they'll have to try and see if love is their destiny once again while facing her fame and his insecurities. The movie also features plenty of quirky moments, including Keanu Reeves playing an odd version of himself as a love interest for Wong's character. And, as an added bonus, there's also Wong's amazing wardrobe. —Lia Beck\n\nWhere to watch Always Be My Maybe: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Nahnatchka Khan\n\nCast: Ali Wong, Randall Park, Keanu Reeves, Daniel Dae Kim, James Saito, Michelle Buteau, Vivian Bang\n\nRelated content: Keanu Reeves' Always Be My Maybe entrance works perfectly with all these songs\n\n02 of 25\n\nBlue Jay (2017)\n\nTwenty years after breaking up, former high-school sweethearts Jim (Mark Duplass, who also wrote the script) and Amanda (Sarah Paulson) bump into each other in their California hometown and end up spending the day — and night — together. As they update each other on what's transpired in their lives in the years since they last spoke, Jim and Amanda reminisce together about the people they used to be while attempting to understand the people they have become. A slice of life film that offers a glimpse into the optimism of youthful infatuation, and the bitter realities of aging, living, and loving, Blue Jay's simple story is still meaty enough for its two leads to dig their performative talons into. One of the best performances of Paulson's career, according to an EW writer, she is \"effortlessly shifting from broken to brazen and everything in between.\" Blue Jay may be shot in black and white, the overall narrative is anything but. —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch Blue Jay: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Alex Lehmann\n\nCast: Mark Duplass, Sarah Paulson\n\nRelated content: Blue Jay: Mark Duplass on acting with Sarah Paulson\n\n03 of 25\n\nCarol (2015)\n\nMad Men lovers will find a similar aesthetic in Carol, a queer romance set against the backdrop of the repressive 1950s. From the moment New Jersey housewife Carol (Cate Blanchett) meets aspiring photographer Therese (Rooney Mara) while Christmas shopping at a New York City department store, it's obvious a connection has been forged. Eager to escape the difficulties presented by the men in their lives, the women find solace in each other, their relationship sparking and burning as brightly as the tips of their cigarettes. Lovingly directed by Todd Haynes who explores issues of class and sexuality with the lightest of touches, EW's critic writes that Carol has \"taken what was once a taboo love story and has allowed it to speak to us with a directness and clarity that would have been hard to imagine more than six decades ago.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Carol: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Todd Haynes\n\nCast: Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Kyle Chandler, Jake Lacy\n\nRelated content: Carol: Controversy erupts after removal of same-sex kissing scenes on Delta Airlines flight\n\n04 of 25\n\nDuck Butter (2018)\n\nLove gets fast-tracked in Duck Butter, a 2018 independent film co-written by and starring Alia Shawkat. Struggling with the local dating scene, actress Naima (Shawkat) and artist Sergio (Laia Costa) meet at a bar and decide to accelerate their relationship by spending 24 hours together and having sex once an hour. But the more time Naima and Sergio spend together, the more they find their quickly-established intimacy tested by new friends and loved ones. While the Sergio character was originally written for a man, the decision to cast a woman instead adds another layer of specificity and nuance. Heavier on the toilet humor than you might expect, Duck Butter is worth a watch for its excellent acting and killer roster of supporting players. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Duck Butter: Netflix\n\nDirector: Miguel Arteta\n\nCast: Alia Shawkat, Mark Duplass, Jay Duplass, Mae Whitman, Hong Chau, Kate Berlant, Kumail Nanjiani\n\nRelated content: Alia Shawkat, Laia Costa explore 'messy' love and sex in Duck Butter trailer\n\n05 of 25\n\nFrances Ha (2013)\n\nOne of the best-known additions to the mumblecore movement that briefly invaded independent cinema during the mid 2010s, Frances Ha is also one of the most charming. Directed by Noah Baumbach and co-written by the film's star, Greta Gerwig, Frances Ha chronicles a difficult period in 27-year-old aspiring dancer Frances Halladay's life. Struggling with the dissolution of one of her closest friendships, financial challenges, and difficulties with her chosen career, Frances is both unmoored and undeterred. A late-20s coming-of-age story released in 2012, Frances Ha contains some vague similarities to HBO's Girls (Adam Driver, for one) which premiered that same year, but the film offers such a high level of style, point of view, and performance as to distinguish itself from the rest of the genre. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Frances Ha: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Noah Baumbach\n\nCast: Greta Gerwig, Adam Driver, Mickey Sumner, Michael Zegen, Michael Esper, Charlotte d'Amboise\n\nRelated content: Frances Ha: Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach interview\n\n06 of 25\n\nThe Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Society (2018)\n\nFans of period romances will fall head over heels for the Netflix original The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society. The 2018 film stars Lily James as a writer who gets to know the residents of Guernsey, an island that had recently been under German occupation during World War II. As for the romantic aspect, the lead character is torn between two men: her American fiancé (Glen Powell) and a new man from Guernsey (Michiel Huisman). EW's review of Mike Newell's film calls it \"as snug and sweet and congenitally British as a tea cozy.\" —L.B.\n\nWhere to watch The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mike Newell\n\nCast: Lily James, Michael Huisman, Glen Powell, Jessica Brown Findlay\n\nRelated content: Pamela Anderson reveals Pam & Tommy star Lily James only wrote her a letter that she never read\n\n07 of 25\n\nThe Half of It (2020)\n\nSecuring Tribeca's Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature, Alice Wu's queer revision of Cyrano de Bergerac introduces viewers to Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis), a booksmart outcast whose writing skills become a lucrative business with her peers as customers. When she starts drafting love letters for himbo jock Paul Munsky (Daniel Diemer, a.k.a. Will Poulter's doppelgänger) to popular girl Aster Flores (Alexxis Lemire) — whom Ellie secretly harbors feelings for — the unlikely pair forge a connection far more profound than any high school crush. Through atmospheric camerawork, whip-smart dialogue, and a sea of film references for cinephiles to bathe in, The Half of It spins a coming-of-age love story that bleeds wisdom beyond its years. —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch The Half of It: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Alice Wu\n\nCast: Leah Lewis, Daniel Diemer, Alexxis Lemire, Enrique Murciano, Wolfgang Novogratz, Catherine Curtin, Becky Ann Baker, Collin Chou\n\nRelated content: How The Half of It's director made a 'humanistic' teen queer romance\n\n08 of 25\n\nThe Incredible Jessica James (2017)\n\nJessica Williams took the world by storm when she became the youngest correspondent on The Daily Show. And after leaving the program in 2016, Williams honed in on film — starting by taking on the roles of Executive Producer and lead actor in the rom-com The Incredible Jessica James. The role of Jessica James was created especially for Williams by writer-director Jim Strouse, and the character is perfectly customized to flaunt her many comedic and performative strengths. In the film, Jessica is an aspiring playwright and employee at a children's theater workshop who just broke up with her boyfriend (LaKeith Stanfield). After her friend Tasha (Noël Wells) sets her up on a date with Boone (Chris O'Dowd), Jessica must decide if their romance is worth pursuing, and what she wants her love life and work life to look like going forward. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Incredible Jessica James: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jim Strouse\n\nCast: Jessica Williams, LaKeith Stanfield, Noël Wells, Chris O'Dowd\n\nRelated content: Shrinking star Jessica Williams breaks down Gaby and Jimmy's drunken decision\n\n09 of 25\n\nKnocked Up (2007)\n\nBased solely on the sheer number of films he wrote, directed, and produced during this period, it's reasonable to assume that Judd Apatow was responsible for at least 10% of the laughs enjoyed during the mid- to late-aughts. Written and directed by Apatow and released two years after the success of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up stars a who's who of comedy legends from the past, present, and future. The film follows Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), an up-and-coming E! News reporter, and Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), a Canadian deadbeat she meets at a Los Angeles nightclub. When a drunken hookup between the two results in an unexpected pregnancy, everyone from Ben's slacker friends to Alison's sister's family get involved as the couple decides to keep the baby and attempt to stay together. Never one to over-edit, Apatow's film runs long, but the jokes are worth it. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Knocked Up: Netflix through July 31\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Judd Apatow\n\nCast: Katherine Heigl, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Martin Starr, Charlyne Yi, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd, Maude Apatow, Iris Apatow\n\nRelated content: Katherine Heigl really delivers in Knocked Up\n\n10 of 25\n\nLady Chatterley's Lover (2022)\n\nIf Fifty Shades of Grey and Bridgerton welcomed a child, its name would be Lady Chatterley's Lover. Enduring decades of bans for its salacious content, D.H. Lawrence's 1928 avant-garde novel gets a fresh adaptation under the heedful eye of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre, who deftly explores the depths of female desire. In this soft-core romance about emotional and bodily fulfillment, an unhappily married aristocrat (Emma Corrin) defies gender roles by acting on her own urges — starting a clandestine affair with the gamekeeper (Jack O'Connell) of her husband's (Matthew Duckett) estate. While EW's critic observes a lack of dramatic conflict in the film, they highlight that \"what's left is just an unabashedly heady romance, rich in pretty costumes — when they're wearing them — and lush, lusty atmosphere.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Lady Chatterley's Lover: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre\n\nCast: Emma Corrin, Jack O'Connell, Matthew Duckett, Faye Marsay, Ella Hunt, Anthony Brophy\n\nRelated content: Emma Corrin recalls painkiller-induced bee hallucinations they had on set of FX series\n\n11 of 25\n\nLa La Land (2016)\n\nLa La Land may not have won Best Picture at the Oscars, but there's a reason the film's name was on everyone's lips (including Faye Dunaway's). A movie musical that dances to the same tune sung by classic films like Singin' in the Rain, La La Land stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as aspiring artists struggling to find work and love in Los Angeles. When Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) find themselves repeatedly running into each other across the city, they take it as a sign to start dating. Gosling and Stone easily recreate the chemistry they established in 2011's Crazy, Stupid, Love, finding a modern spin on the Old Hollywood premise that everything always works out in love and art. Named by EW as our best movie of 2016, La La Land is \"Nostalgic without seeming old-fashioned…a testament to the timeless, transporting power of cinema.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch La La Land: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Damien Chazelle\n\nCast: Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Rosemarie DeWitt, J.K. Simmons\n\nRelated content: Damien Chazelle's La La Land to foxtrot its way to Broadway\n\n12 of 25\n\nLong Shot (2019)\n\nIt’s a timeless tale: an ambitious Secretary of State (Charlize Theron) reunites with the boy she once babysat (Seth Rogen), now a political journalist who's job hunting after getting fired for his incendiary, left-leaning writing. Recruiting him to punch up her speeches for her presidential election campaign, the two travel the world on a diplomatic tour while also discovering sparks between them. A cross between Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Veep — with a little There’s Something About Mary (1998) thrown in for good measure — Long Shot brings a political edge to the rom-com genre, as Dan Sterling (The Interview) and Liz Hannah's (The Post) script features a perfect blend of satire, treasured tropes, and rapid-fire dialogue that comes alive with some serious chemistry between its two leads. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Long Shot: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jonathan Levine\n\nCast: Seth Rogen, Charlize Theron, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Andy Serkis, June Diane Raphael, Bob Odenkirk, Alexander Skarsgård\n\nRelated reading: Long Shot's funniest star June Diane Raphael explains why the rom-com is cathartic\n\n13 of 25\n\nLove at First Sight (2023)\n\nThe year 2022 saw the rise (and slight meme-ification) of The White Lotus star Haley Lu Richardson, thus paving the way for her lead role in this 2023 adaptation of Jennifer E. Smith's best-selling novel, The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight. Here, Richardson's quirky charm is on full display as Hadley Sullivan, a 20-year-old American who spends her seven-hour flight from New York to London engrossed in banter with her charismatic British seatmate, Oliver (Ben Hardy). (Alexa, play \"London Boy\" by Taylor Swift.) Once the strangers part ways upon landing, fate works its magic. Without venturing into cringe territory, Love at First Sight pulls off a time-worn, formulaic trope by simply embracing its sweetness — thanks to Richardson and Hardy's onscreen magnetism, a carefully curated indie soundtrack, and Jameela Jamil's intimate narrations — leaving you plotting your next trip in hopes of an airport meet-cute. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Love at First Sight: Netflix\n\nDirector: Vanessa Caswill\n\nCast: Haley Lu Richardson, Ben Hardy, Jameela Jamil, Rob Delaney, Sally Phillips, Dexter Fletcher\n\nRelated content: Watch Haley Lu Richardson have the best day ever as Today's Jonas Brothers correspondent\n\n14 of 25\n\nThe Lovebirds (2020)\n\nAfter four years of dating, Jibran (Kumail Nanjiani) and Leilani (Issa Rae) are prepared to call it quits — until the couple finds themselves involved in a murder that requires them to put their break up aside and go on the run. Too concerned about racial profiling to involve the police, Jibran and Leilani must hunt down the identity of the man who was murdered so they can find out who killed him and clear their own names. Directed by Michael Showalter (Wet Hot American Summer), The Lovebirds is a romantic evening gone wrong in the style of films like 2010's Date Night and 2018's Game Night. Boasting a high ratio of jokes per minute and a pair of lead actors who know how to wield their witticisms like machetes, Nanjiani and Rae's on screen bickering and loving needling will have you rooting for their relationship, even as it's falling apart. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Lovebirds: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Michael Showalter\n\nCast: Kumail Nanjiani, Issa Rae, Anna Camp, Paul Sparks\n\nRelated content: Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani have a quarantine conversation about relationships and Marvel fights\n\n15 of 25\n\nNo Hard Feelings (2023)\n\nJennifer Lawrence is such an accomplished dramatic actress, it’s easy to forget her first big career break came on the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show. But her comedic chops are rock solid, and she gets to show them off in the 2023 raunch-com No Hard Feelings. Lawrence plays Maddie, a struggling thirtysomething who agrees to seduce a wealthy couple’s introverted 19-year-old in exchange for a car. The premise is simple but the execution is designed to let Lawrence play in ways we haven’t seen since Silver Linings Playbook. From taking throat punches to brawling naked, the Oscar winner manages to balance the physical comedy of the film while still centering the story’s emotional heart. As EW’s critic writes, No Hard Feelings is “a reminder that Lawrence is one Hollywood's best (and funniest) leads.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch No Hard Feelings: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gene Stupnitsky\n\nCast: Jennifer Lawrence, Andrew Barth Feldman, Laura Benanti, Natalie Morales, Matthew Broderick\n\nRelated content: No Hard Feelings star Andrew Barth Feldman is a graduate of the Jennifer Lawrence school of comedy\n\n16 of 25\n\nOur Souls at Night (2017)\n\nSome partnerships just keep getting better with age, and the onscreen relationship between Robert Redford and Jane Fonda — now in its fourth iteration — is one of those unions. In the Netflix original movie Our Souls at Night, Redford and Fonda play longtime neighbors and widowers Louis and Addie, who find comfort in spending their nights together as platonic friends. Aware that their unorthodox relationship and sleeping arrangement is eliciting side eyes from the town and their adult children, the pair must eventually choose between their growing emotional dependence on each other and the needs of their respective families. With a cast of only seven actors, the strength of Our Souls at Night lies mainly in the steady hands of its two leads, who make falling in love look just as appealing as they did half a century ago in Barefoot In The Park. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Our Souls at Night: Netflix\n\nDirector: Ritesh Batra\n\nCast: Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Judy Greer, Matthias Schoenaerts, Bruce Dern, Iain Armitage\n\nRelated content: Our Souls at Night: Jane Fonda and Robert Redford reunite for Netflix movie\n\n17 of 25\n\nPhantom Thread (2017)\n\nThere are lots of lighthearted romantic movies on Netflix, but if you're looking for something much, much darker, there's Phantom Thread. The Paul Thomas Anderson movie stars Daniel Day-Lewis as a fashion designer who finds a muse and partner in a waitress (Vicky Krieps) during the 1950s. The couple's relationship is rocky to say the least, and some poisonous mushrooms play a hefty role in the film's tension. \"What's true with Daniel is that you're always in front of someone very awake, so you have to be awake,\" Krieps tells EW about working with Day-Lewis in what is purportedly his final role. \"You couldn't go and do something not really knowing what you're doing or being half thinking about your lunch. It wouldn't work because you'd just crash against the wall.\" —L.B.\n\nWhere to watch Phantom Thread: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nCast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Kreips, Lesley Manville\n\nRelated content: Phantom Thread: See the gorgeous '50s costumes\n\n18 of 25\n\nPlus One (2019)\n\nFed up with being single during wedding season, two Millennial college pals Ben (Jack Quaid) and Alice (Maya Erskine) agree to be each other's platonic plus ones at every event. Winning Tribeca's Narrative Audience Award in 2019, Plus One is a lighthearted buddy-comedy that blossoms into a richly nuanced friends-to-lovers romance, showcasing two fully realized characters who share universal anxieties of being alone and societal expectations to settle down. Erskine summed up the film to EW, saying: \"At its core, it’s a movie about friendship [and] she’s able to be her ugliest self. She’s able to fart, curse, and show every facet of herself and still be looked at as a beautiful woman, and to me, that’s what sets it aside from other romantic comedies.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Plus One: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Jeff Chan, Andrew Rhymer\n\nCast: Maya Erskine, Jack Quaid, Beck Bennett, Rosalind Chao, Perrey Reeves, Ed Begley Jr.\n\nRelated content: See PEN15 star Maya Erskine as a foul-mouthed wingman in Plus One exclusive clip\n\n19 of 25\n\nSet It Up (2018)\n\nIf you found Glen Powell to be perfect boyfriend material in Anyone but You (2023), wait until you see him paired with the dynamic Zoey Deutch in Set It Up. When two stress-ridden assistants from adjoining companies, Harper (Deutch) and Charlie (Powell), conspire to set up their Type-A bosses (Taye Diggs, Lucy Liu) in hopes of freeing themselves from the nonstop office grind, it sparks an enemies-to-lovers fling between the two matchmakers that's as satisfying as a sublime slice of pizza. Set It Up ranks among Netflix's finest rom-coms, injecting the genre's familiar elements with an extra dose of heart — all fueled by the palpable chemistry between Powell and Deutch. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Set It Up: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Claire Scanlon\n\nCast: Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Lucy Liu, Taye Diggs, Joan Smalls, Meredith Hagner, Pete Davidson, Jon Rudnitsky, Tituss Burgess\n\nRelated content: How Lucy Liu became the charming boss-from-hell in the Netflix rom-com Set It Up\n\n20 of 25\n\nShe's Gotta Have It (1986)\n\nSpike Lee’s first feature film as a writer and director, She’s Gotta Have It presents intertwining romances as lead character Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) decides which of the three men she’s dating (Lee, Tommy Redmond Hicks, John Canada Terrell) she wants to have a monogamous relationship with. Luxuriating in Lee’s creative sensibility and shot in crisp black and white, Nola’s journey towards picking a partner is funny, thought-provoking, and unique in every respect. In a review of Netflix’s 2017 She’s Gotta Have It adaptation (also directed by Lee), EW’s critic describes the original movie, writing, “She’s Gotta Have It was Spike Lee’s first feature film, and few movies feel so joyfully first.” A dramedy that questions sexual, relationship, and gender norms of the time, She’s Gotta Have It is notable for its subject matter, aesthetic, and for launching Lee’s storied Hollywood career. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch She’s Gotta Have It: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nCast: Tracy Camilla Johns, Spike Lee, Tommy Redmond Hicks, John Canada Terrell\n\nRelated content: Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It Netflix series is 'crackling'\n\n21 of 25\n\nShortcomings (2023)\n\nRegrettably overshadowed during its initial release by the Barbieheimer phenomenon, Randall Park's directorial debut is an underdog deserving of a spot on your Letterboxd watchlist. Adapted from the beloved graphic novel by The New Yorker's Adrian Tomine, Shortcomings trails the introspective journey of Asian American man-child/culture snob, Ben Tagawa (Justin H. Min), whose on-the-mends relationship with girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki) hits a temporary pause once she relocates from California to the Big Apple for an internship. With the dubious counsel of his skirt-chasing best friend, Alice (Sherry Cola), Ben dives headfirst back into the dating pool and grapples with his own desires, which exposes his inclination toward Western standards of beauty. A film about accepting life's ebbs and flows, Shortcomings invites audiences to witness Park's burgeoning directorial talent while engaging in incisive social commentary, particularly on the complexities of race in relationships. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Shortcomings: Netflix\n\nDirector: Randall Park\n\nCast: Justin H.

Emotionally buttressed by her best friends Erin (DeWanda Wise) and Blair (Brittany Snow), Jenny decides to make the most of her last night in New York City, and along the way encounters an eclectic supporting cast including Rosario Dawson, RuPaul, and SNL's Alex Moffat. In addition to being a solid modern rom-com, Someone Great also has great significance in Swiftie lore: Taylor's 2014 song \"Clean\" off the 1989 album was one of the inspirations for the film's story, and Swift wrote Lover's \"Death By A Thousand Cuts\" after seeing the movie. Deeply relatable for anyone who's been blindsided or suffered a broken heart, Someone Great is about endings, beginnings, and finding the joy in both. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Someone Great: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jennifer Kaytin Robinson\n\nCast: Gina Rodriguez, DeWanda Wise, Brittany Snow, LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, RuPaul, Alex Moffat\n\nRelated content: Camila Mendes and Maya Hawke to headline Someone Great director's new 'dark comedy'\n\n23 of 25\n\nSomething's Gotta Give (2003)\n\nThe Nancy Meyers cinematic universe is the MCU of rom-coms, and Something's Gotta Give brings forth all of the hallmarks of a model Meyers flick: from coastal live-laugh-love vibes and wardrobes overflowing with chic neutrals (and turtlenecks galore) to lavish interiors and charming kitchen scenes. Here, we meet sixtysomething bachelor Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson), who — when fooling around with his younger girlfriend, Marin (Amanda Peet) — has a heart attack and lands him in the care of Marin's mother, fiftysomething playwright Erica Barry (Diane Keaton). With a cast that only dreams can make up, including Keaton in her Oscar-nominated performance and pre-John Wick Keanu Reeves as a young thriving doctor, the quite rote rom-com still possesses an energy brimming with the right amount of charm and comfort. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Something's Gotta Give: Netflix through July 31\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Nancy Meyers\n\nCast: Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves, Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, Jon Favreau\n\nRelated content: Diane Keaton and Keanu Reeves give us the Something's Gotta Give ending we deserved at Oscars\n\n24 of 25\n\nThe Theory of Everything (2014)\n\nThe name Stephen Hawking elicits certain images, but in 2014’s The Theory of Everything, the world gets a closer look at the theoretical physicist before his body was afflicted by a motor neuron disease. A biographical film that holds multiple love stories within, The Theory of Everything is a solid drama, but the movie’s real power rests with its actors. Felicity Jones, is excellent as Hawking’s wife, Jane, but it’s Eddie Redmayne as Hawking who blows minds. EW’s critic writes “It’s like watching an escape artist who’s bound and gagged break free from a straitjacket. What Redmayne does is breathtaking — and it never feels like a performance.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Theory of Everything: Netflix through July 31\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: James Marsh\n\nCast: Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones, Charlie Cox, Emily Watson\n\nRelated content: TIFF: Eddie Redmayne and capturing the smiling eyes of Stephen Hawking\n\n25 of 25\n\nTo All the Boys I've Loved Before (2018)\n\nNavigating high school is painful enough without all of your crushes finding out you like them — at the same time. A modern rom-com that EW's critic calls \"breezy and charming,\" To All the Boys I've Loved Before follows Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) as her worst fears are realized when the love letters she never meant to send find their way to the boys who inspired them. Cornered by love, Lara Jean negotiates a sham relationship with her former crush to throw off her current one, but when feelings start catching, Lara Jean must deal with the consequences of both her lies and the truths she's starting to realize. The first in a series of three films, which also include 2020's To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You and 2021's To All the Boys: Always and Forever, the original still hits the hardest. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch To All the Boys I've Loved Before: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Susan Johnson\n\nCast: Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, Janel Parrish, Anna Cathcart, Andrew Bachelor, Trezzo Mahoro, Madeleine Arthur, Emilija Baranac, Israel Broussard, John Corbett\n\nRelated content: Netflix's To All the Boys I've Loved Before screenwriter adapting YA novel Along for the Ride"
