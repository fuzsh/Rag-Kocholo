        "text": "Widely celebrated on last year’s festival circuit, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s “Drive My Car” is the focus of renewed attention owing to its four Academy Award nominations. It’s an exquisite Tower of Babel of a film—a thrilling mélange of Japanese, Korean, English, Mandarin, Tagalog, Indonesian, German, and Malaysian. All these languages, with the crucial addition of Korean Sign Language, are braided throughout (the gorgeous signing by the actress Park Yurim just about breaks your heart). In addition to Best Picture, “Drive My Car” is nominated for Best International Feature—if it doesn’t win in that category, it’s not clear what the award is for.\n\nIt’s a film that, even in Hamaguchi’s native Japan, is inconceivable without subtitles. Captioning is both layered onto and represented in the film: it is, as they say in film studies, both diegetic and non-diegetic. The protagonist, Yusuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima), a theatrical director known for his unconventional methods, casts a play with actors of diverse nationalities who perform their roles in their native tongue. When we first see him on stage (he’s by turns an actor and director), he’s playing Vladimir in Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot,” speaking his lines in Japanese; the production’s Estragon replies in Indonesian. The film’s subtitling game is so strong that it requires three distinct typographies: roman type for translation from Japanese; roman type in parentheses for translations from all other languages (in the U.S. release, English is not subtitled); and italic for translations of sign language, as well as from signage (“Flowers & Vegetables For Sale” at a roadside shop). The film immerses us in what the French literary theorist Roland Barthes called “the pleasure of the text,” and the film proves to be a master class in one of his key concepts: intertextuality. In Barthes’s formulation, every text is woven together from disparate elements—among them, other texts. Every text, consciously or not, is “a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture.”\n\nA film that takes its title from and announces itself as “based upon” a Haruki Murakami short story would seem to be explicitly acknowledging its literary debts. Yet this is a bit misleading. “Drive My Car” does lean most heavily on the Murakami story of the same name (“Doraibu mai kā” in the original Japanese publication), but while “Drive My Car” provides the film’s spine, Hamaguchi has said that he found the story’s ending “abrupt,” telling an interviewer, “I felt like I needed to take that story somewhere beyond where it ends on the page.” He found the material to do so in two other stories from the 2014 collection in which “Drive My Car” appeared. The film’s most important and explicit intertext is Anton Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya”; the play’s titular character is Kafuku’s signature role as an actor, and most of the film focusses on a production he’s been brought to Hiroshima to direct, two years after his wife’s death. It’s a play he literally knows by heart—not just his role, but those of every character. While being driven the hour to and from the theatre every day, Kafuku listens to a tape of the play, recorded for him by his late wife, Oto (Reika Kirishima), in which Vanya’s lines are left out; he supplies them from the back seat. This preparation is part of the Kafuku “method.” “The flow of the entire play,” he explains to his driver, Misaki Watari (Toko Miura), “has to be memorized.”\n\nWe’ve recently been reminded by Isaac Butler’s new book of the lasting influence of Method acting. Kafuku’s method, on the other hand, is resolutely anti-Method: submit yourself to the text without any preconceptions, read the text without supplying any external emotions. He attempts to impose this discipline on Koshi Takatsuki (Masaki Okada), the young actor whom he’s cast as his Vanya, only to be interrupted by Janice Chang, another member of the cast:\n\nKafuku: Try focussing on your text. All you have to do is read it.\n\nJanice: [sotto voce] We’re not robots.\n\nK: What do you mean?\n\nJ: Of course we’ll follow all of your instructions. But we’re not robots, and I think we’ll do better if we know what your intent is.\n\nK: You don’t have to “do better.” Just simply read the text.\n\nShe all but cries out the quintessential (or clichéd) question of the Method actor: “What’s my motivation?” For Kafuku, the text reads us, and reveals us to ourselves. As he later explains to Takatsuki, “Chekhov is terrifying. When you say his lines, it drags out the real you.”\n\nKafuku, we quickly realize, fully intends for Chekhov to terrify Takatsuki in a very particular way. (Plentiful spoilers ahead.) Kafuku knows, without having confided it either to Takatsuki or to Oto before her death, that the two had been sleeping together. In a twist on Prince Hamlet’s play within a play, Kafuku believes that “Vanya” is the thing wherein he’ll catch the conscience of—well, not the king, but his wife’s matinée-idol lover. At the table reading, Takatsuki (as Vanya) is visibly shaken to be drawn into exchanges such as these:\n\nAstrov: … you’re in love with his wife?\n\nVoynitsky [Vanya]: She’s a good friend of mine.\n\nA: Already?\n\nV: What do you mean by “already”?\n\nA: There’s a proper order for a woman to become a man’s friend. First she’s an acquaintance, then she’s a lover, and, finally, she becomes a good friend.\n\nShakespeare’s Claudius only had to sit in the audience while his treachery was hinted at; Kafuku makes Takatsuki confess his infidelity in front of his director, the man he’s wronged.\n\nThe film’s most powerful narrative device is a near-continuous deployment of this type of dramatic irony. It’s not there in any of the Murakami source material; along with screenwriter Takamasa Oe, Hamaguchi has realized the eerie dramatic potential of Chekhov’s words when wrested from their original context. We’re first made aware of the uncanny relevance of the text of “Vanya,” written more than a century earlier, almost twenty minutes into the film. Kafuku has walked in on, but remains unseen by, Oto and Takatsuki making love. He turns around quietly, gets back in his car, and begins to rehearse his Vanya. But “Vanya” takes him right back to the scene he’s trying to forget:\n\nVanya: For twenty-five years he’s been pretending to be someone he’s not. Look at that swagger, acting like he’s some kind of lord.\n\nAstrov: [read on the tape by Oto] You envy him, don’t you?\n\nVanya: Yes, I do. I envy him a lot. Such good luck with women. Don Juan himself couldn’t have had more experience.\n\nTakatsuki is probably closer to thirty, but the point is clear: Chekhov’s text is dragging out the real Kafuku, even forcing him, in the theatre of his red Saab 900 Turbo, to have the conversation he was never able to broach with his wife in real life.\n\nOften, the film’s editing makes it difficult to know when Kafuku is playing Vanya and when he’s in propria persona. After a jump cut places his car in one of the film’s innumerable tunnels, this one nearly pitch-black, we hear Kafuku speaking: “There must be something. I can’t take this. I’m forty-seven years old. If I live to be sixty, that’s thirteen years I have before me. That’s so long. How am I supposed to live out those thirteen years?” Is it live, or is it “Vanya”? The film is filled with such uncanny moments, though many aren’t obvious until a second viewing. In the most extreme case, Takatsuki, sitting in the back seat of the Saab with Kafuku, recites dialogue from a story that Oto has told him; it ends with him voicing the protagonist’s confession: “I killed him! I killed him! I killed him!” We in the audience don’t yet know that minutes earlier Takatsuki has beaten up a fan who has invaded his privacy, and even Takatsuki doesn’t yet know that the fan will die of his injuries. When the Hiroshima police show up at rehearsal to arrest him for the killing, Takatsuki has just shot Serebryakov on the stage.\n\nSometimes these intertextual echoes simply provide grace notes. Early in the film, Kafuku is diagnosed with glaucoma in his left eye and prescribed eye drops to reduce the ocular pressure. The first time we see him use them, he’s been driving around Tokyo, staying away from his home, avoiding the talk that his wife has requested—and which he fears will signal the end of, or at least a cataclysmic change in, their relationship. In the parked car, his cassette tape plays, and Chekhov’s Sonya, voiced by his wife Oto, is in the midst of her closing monologue: “And when our last hour comes we’ll go quietly. And in the great beyond we’ll say to Him that we suffered, that we cried, that life was hard.” And there’s Kafuku, with tears of prescription eye drops rolling down his cheek.\n\nKafuku’s “method” is intended precisely to keep the actor and their role separate; Vanya, we’re shown, is a place to which he retreats in order to avoid the unresolved conflicts in his marriage and his life. Shortly after Oto’s death, Kafuku is back on the boards as Vanya; but when he comes to lines that have already struck us in the audience as uncomfortably ironic—those quoted above that he recites as he drives away from the scene of his wife’s infidelity—their weight becomes too much for him to bear, and he stumbles offstage, leaving the other actors to improvise around his absence.\n\nIn the sleek confessional of Kafuku’s Saab, Watari becomes his unlikely confessor; she is able to recognize as confession the dialogue that he thinks of as Chekhov’s, not his. The film takes the time that’s required to make us believe in the relationship that grows between them, but you don’t begrudge it—not often does one learn that a two-hundred-minute film was edited down to three hours and desperately want to see those twenty lost minutes. Through Watari’s mediation, and through the surprisingly wise advice of none other than Takatsuki, his wife’s seducer, Kafuku is able to bring together the role and the life, to find the middle ground between Stanislavski’s Method and his own. When he first meets Watari and is told that she will be his driver, Kafuku is quietly furious: he wants to drive his own car. While we’re never going to hear him belt out the Beatles song’s refrain, by the film’s end, he’s recognized the importance of letting someone else take the driver’s seat."
