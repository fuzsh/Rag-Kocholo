I'm saddened that this ended a few months back, but I want to thank Levar for sharing his gift of storytelling with us. My gratitude. I loved them all. Dan\n\nI will miss you and this podcast. I hope we will see and/or hear you doing other projects. Thank you!!!!\n\nJust found this podcast like several others on here and so sad to find out it ended in May 2024! Please, Mr. Burton, come back to us!!"
