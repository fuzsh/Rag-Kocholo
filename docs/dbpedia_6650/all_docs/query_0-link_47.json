Because they aim for movies at native speakers who are already fluent in the language.\n\nThe language structure and flow should be precise and realistic rather than the rigid textbook. This is where movies make a great way to improve your language skills.\n\nHistorical or fantasy flicks may not always correctly reflect current speech trends. But most modern films use everyday language that the viewer will understand.\n\nWhen you listen to an actual, native speech portrayed in the movies. In that case, you are more likely to understand authentic dialogue in context.\n\nThe Japanese cinemas help you get used to those difficult accents, honorific sounds, and pronunciations. You also understand diverse dialects and standard informal and conversational phrases.\n\nBesides ESL teaching in Japan, viewing Japanese movies can be valuable.\n\nUnlike a dictionary or book, the movie vocabulary is heavily contextualized. Thus, you won’t have to rely only on the words to understand what’s happening.\n\nYou’ll make assumptions or educated guesses if you don’t comprehend a term. You do this based on what’s going on and visual cues like character facial expressions, which will aid you in learning other words.\n\nYou can also look at the terminology used in different situations to see when alternative terms are suitable.\n\nThe best thing is that learning Japanese is enjoyable. Viewing Japanese movies for hours on end would not bore you. It’s more satisfying than studying phrases or terminology from a textbook.\n\nViewing movies also stimulates both the auditory and visual senses at once. It makes it easier to remember information because our minds prefer to focus more and keep everything in a way that we enjoy.\n\nWhere to see Japanese cinema?\n\nMany Japanese movies, TV series, and dramas are available online and through streaming services.\n\nYou can enjoy Japanese movies on OTT services like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, YouTube Premium, some Japanese channels, etc.\n\nMany websites offer legitimate Japanese titles that you can view at your convenience. Besides, Netflix and other platforms produce original and exclusive content for their big audiences.\n\nTop 26 Films for Japanese language learners\n\nOne of the fastest-growing film industries globally, production in Japan makes tons of movies every year.\n\nThe Japanese film industry produces many high-quality films.

The hospital had accidentally switched the babies at birth.\n\nThe two families agree to re-unite the boys, but they soon realize that the bonds they have created are more substantial than just bloodlines.\n\nThis Japanese cinema is good for understanding the everyday conversations of family relations and the importance of human bonds.\n\n8. Adrift In Tokyo (転々) — 2007\n\nAdrift in Tokyo is a 2007 movie that is quirky and engaging in its plot. It follows the story of Takemura, who has no relatives or friends. He’s a law student, but he has no particular goals in his mind.\n\nA Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) who has money offers him a deal.

This is the story of a group of high school students with various troubles, ranging from bulimia to suicidal ideation. Yet, the film doesn’t tone down the provocative nature of the manga.\n\nIt depicts the dark side of peer relationships and the pressures students encounter at school and otherwise, naturally and realistically.\n\nThe characters in this film sound like genuine Japanese teens.

So whether you are learning for a hobby or wish to make a career in the Japanese language, you should watch it.\n\n12. Still Walking (歩いても 歩いても) — 2008\n\nAnother family-based movie, Still walking questions and rediscovers the meaning of what makes a family.\n\nThe plot revolves around how the Yokoyama family gathers yearly to commemorate the loss of Junpei, the oldest son. The latter drowned while attempting to save a youngster from the water.\n\nAlthough everyone in the family appears to get along, the fact is that they seldom speak or see each other. Despite this, they are still a family; they quarrel, make peace with one another, disagree, and compromise.\n\nYet again, the conversations being based on routine and day-to-day family matters make it a good movie for beginners.\n\n13. Departures (おくりびと) — 2008\n\nReleased in 2008, this movie is a globally acclaimed and award-winning film. The translation of the Japanese title refers to a group whose duty is to prepare the bodies of those who have passed away.\n\nThis film is thought-provoking, compassionate, and heartbreaking despite the gruesome-sounding meaning. After losing the job, the movie follows a cellist. He was compelled to start a new occupation ceremonially preparing bodies for cremation.\n\nThis movie is ideal for understanding Japanese and how native speakers do. It has a lot of spoken phrases or words rather than just textbook vocabulary making it the go-to film for beginners.\n\n14. Your Eyes Tell (きみの瞳（め）が問いかけている) — 2020\n\nYour Eyes Tell a heart-warming and beautiful story about love. It follows the story of Akari, who is blind, and a former kickboxer named Antonio. They fall in love but have a twisted connection of fate as Antonio was involved in the accident that blinded Akari.\n\nOut of guilt and love towards her, he works extra hard to win the championship that will give him the money for her treatment.\n\nBesides the beautiful plot, focusing on pronunciation and simple vocabulary makes it a good movie to learn Japanese from.\n\n15. Tampopo (タンポポ) — 1985\n\nTampopo is a Japanese classic comedy released in 1985. The title translates to ‘dandelion,’ which seems appropriate given that the film is about a poor ramen shop owner. With the help of a new friend, he sets out to enhance the quality of her offerings.\n\nTheir journey involves arguments, mishaps, and accidents leading to the brink of death, trials and errors, and comedy. The language is easy to understand, but the film has several sophisticated ideas to keep your attention on the edge of your seat.\n\nAside from the language, it provides some interesting insights into Japanese cultures, like its concern with food.\n\n16. Seven Samurai (七人の侍) — 1954\n\nWhat exquisite storytelling! The 1954 masterpiece Seven Samurai, directed by Akira Kurosawa, is a three-and-a-half-hour epic. It has inspired countless films throughout the 20th century.\n\nThat is the only black-and-white movie that I have seen several times. In fact, I will not hesitate to say that it is my favorite all-time Japanese film.\n\nThe story of Seven Samurai is about a poverty-stricken village frequently attacked by bandits. The villagers recruit a group of seven mighty Samurai to fight against them. But unfortunately, the victory was a Pyrrhic one, in which everyone lost, and only the peasants won.\n\nThe fantastic adventure with an irresistible story, astonishing action scenes, and splendid acting makes this a must-see Japanese movie. Watch once, and it will change your outlook on classic cinemas.\n\nThe dialogues are tricky to understand since the variation differs from the modern Japanese version. But, the slow-paced talks provide enough time to understand the pronunciation and sentences.\n\n17. 13 Assassins (十三人の刺客) — 2010\n\nIt is an action-packed and historical movie that talks about the thirteen Samurai. They came together to stop the works of an evil lord when Japan was operating a feudal system.\n\nThe movie is an action film with many brutal fight scenes without deviating from the storyline. The last fight scene in the 13 Assassins lasts over 40 minutes. Make sure not to miss it.\n\nThe flick used archaic and harsher words rather than the traditional samurai intonation. As a result, the film is like watching a French movie from the 1900s instead of a 21st-century one.\n\nThis movie will provide a new perspective on Japanese history, especially the Shogun era.\n\n18. Spirited Away (千と千尋の神隠し) — (2001)\n\nThose who love animation and spiritism should watch this film. After seeing her parents turn into pigs, a young girl fights for survival in the spirits’ world.\n\nAlthough some people may find the film’s narrative unsettling, it is one of the best fables to ever come from the land of the rising sun. This is why it won the 2001 Academic Awards for Best Animation.\n\nThe film has plenty of easy-to-understand vocabulary and illustrative patterns of speech. In addition, the dialogues help enhance your articulation, intonation, and vernacular tongue.\n\n19. Ringu (リング) — 1998\n\nRingu is one of Japan’s silver screen’s most famous horror movies. Thus, it is the ideal movie for learning Japanese who love watching horror films.\n\nThe R-rated movie showcases a bizarre and horrifying videotape that kills and destroys anyone who sees it. The only exception is unless it can crack the mystery covering it.\n\nRingu, a Hollywood remake called “Ring,” is a flick that puts you in a problematic situation of not missing out. So if you are looking for a Japanese horror movie, watch this.\n\nThe movie contains many wonderful phrases, syntax, and excellent vocabulary flow. This is suitable for both beginners and intermediate Japanese language students. It gives lots of room to grasp the underlying meaning.\n\n20. Shoplifters (万引き家族) — 2018\n\nIn the drama genre, Shoplifters is an award-winning and popular film. An abject poverty-stricken family is the subject of the film. Shoplifting is the only way to escape poverty.\n\nThe movie is fascinating because it challenges the stereotypes that dominate Japanese society. For example, Japanese culture puts a lot of importance on a family’s name, blood, and image.\n\nThe film centers on family, but the storyline implies that family may not always be the best blood. In the movie, children are neglected and abused, an issue facing Japan today. It also shows how poverty is often overlooked and overlooked.\n\nWatching the Shoplifters is a great way to see Japan from a different perspective.\n\nIt’s easy to follow the speakers’ speech patterns and words, as their actions often follow their words. This movie can be helpful if you are preparing for the NAT test.\n\n21. Dark Water (仄暗い水の底から) — 2002\n\nThis thriller is a must-watch for horror movie fans. Yoshimi is a divorced mother who is the movie’s main character. After her daughter, Ikuko, separated, she moved into a separate apartment.\n\nThere is another apartment above hers, and even though it looked abandoned, there was a leak. As strange and horrific things began to happen to the lady as she continued to live in her apartment.\n\nShe soon learned that a certain young girl had died in that flat. The film Dark Water examines the challenges single mothers face in Japan and the relationship between parents and children.\n\nThe language is simple, with day-to-day vocabulary, verbs, and phrases. You can use this to prepare for the N4 and N5 of the JLPT test.\n\n22. Our Little Sister (海街) — 2015\n\nA must-watch Japanese family drama is Our Little Sister. Following the death of their father, three sisters came to terms with how to accept a sibling.\n\nDespite the sisters’ already blossoming bond, the estranged arrival will be the one to determine how long and how effective it will last.\n\nThey set Japanese family dramas up in daily life, making them effortless to follow. This makes the movie friendly for someone who wishes to learn the Japanese language. Besides, it has an exact and solid vocabulary.\n\n23. Sweet Bean (あん) — 2015\n\nSweet Bean is your dish if you enjoy food and want to watch a film in a language. The motion picture tells about a man who runs a small dorayaki shop based on a simple storyline.\n\nThere’s nothing sweeter than red bean paste in this Japanese pastry. Known as Sentaro, this man hires a woman specializing in bean paste delicacies.\n\nHe removes Tokue from the job when he learns she has an illness. The film explores how discrimination isolates people from society. An incredible masterpiece from an acclaimed filmmaker, Sweet Bean, is beautifully shot.\n\nThe speech pattern and language use are less complex. This is good for beginners to learn about Japan’s prejudice and history and improve their Japanese language skills.\n\n24. Your Name (君の名は。) — 2016\n\nJ-dramas offer plenty of intrigues for drama buffs, and this is no exception.\n\nTaki and Mitsuha, two high school friends, swap bodies when they wake up from sleep.
