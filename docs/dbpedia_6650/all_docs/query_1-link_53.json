This is the definitive list of the Top 250 Greatest Martial Arts Movies from The East, to West, And Back Again.... \n\nMovies that fall under my \"Martial Arts\" category and will be considered and included here are as follows: Hand to Hand Combat, (Kung Fu, Hapkido, Filipino Kali, Jeet Kune Do, Muay Thai, Karate, Pankration, MMA, Etc...) Samurai, Ninjas, and Anything to do with Weapon Use & Swordplay.",

        "text": "I know its cliche to have one of Bruce Lee's films at the top, but who can argue with his impact? Seriously. There were martial arts films before him sure, however he is the sole reason the genre exploded in the 70's, and well after his death to even today and for many more years to come, He broke down racial barriers and became the first Asian Superstar the world has ever known, His work ethic and workout regime was ahead of its time, he founded his own form of Martial Arts, and came up with the concept of mixing different aspect from different forms from all over the world to make the most affective use in any situation, basically to adapt to any fighting method, which went on to of course inspire the UFC & MMA in general and for that reason he is being hailed as the \"Father of Mixed Martial Arts\" and his impact on POPULAR culture is incredible, especially with just 4 completed Kung Fu films under his belt.... Bruce Lee is the KING of KUNG FU Cinema and is arguably the greatest Martial Artist of the 20th century. He is a Philosopher, a Teacher, A Director, A Writer, An Actor, A MARTIAL ARTIST, An Inspiration, A Family Man, and A Legend. Its safe to say he influenced & inspired EVERYONE on this list.\n\nAs for Fist of Fury taking the top spot, i can tell you right now, it was a bitch ranking these films, especially the Top 10, they are ALL Masterpieces, and are interchangeable really, it just so happens im in a \"Fist of Fury mood\" at the moment and any of Bruce's films can and should be at the top anyway, doesn't matter which one, they are ALL land marks in cinema history as far as im concerned. This film may not be as polished as many other films on this list, it had a lower budget too, and sure, it feels a bit dated by today's standards. But there is no arguing at Bruce Lee being a timeless icon. His charisma, influence and overall skill is still unmatched today. Bottom line is, there would be no Jackie Chans, Van Dammes, And/or Jet Lis without this man and his contribution to the Martial Arts World & Cinema.\n\nTRIVIA:\n\n-A Young Jackie Chan appears as an Extra.\n\n-Jet Li Remade the film as \"Fist of Legend.\" He then went on to film a \"Prequel\" in the form of \"Fearless.\"\n\n-Donnie Yen Also Remade it for TV as \"Fist Of Fury: Sworn Revenge.\" He went on to film a Sequel entitled \"Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zen.\"\n\nBased on the true story of real life martial arts master Huo Yuanjia.\n\nThis film is ranked at the # 2 spot after viewing the DIRECTORS CUT. The theatrical version was fine for casual movie goers and if i rank that version of the film on here it'd be at # 5, but if you fancy yourself a \"martial arts movie fan\" or a fan of GOOD CINEMA in general, pick up the DIRECTORS CUT, the one that opens and ends with a special cameo by Michelle Yeoh, features a deleted fight scene with a Muay Thai Boxer, and additional footage to help flesh out the story more and develop the characters. The Directors Cut in my honest opinion is Jet Li's Masterpiece. In it he expresses in-detail what he believes is the true meaning of \"Wushu.\" It is a story about the journey on takes, Full of Tragedy, Self Growth, Perseverance, and Self Discovery. The Directors Cut is the only way to see this film, the story is alot more complete, the fights uncensored, uncut, and overall the film is that much more Beautiful in comparison to the butchered, dubbed, and dumbed down version released in theaters. I highly recommend you see the film the way Jet Li and the rest of the cast and crew originally intended it to be.\n\nTRIVIA:\n\n-Huo Yuan Jia, the founder of the Jin Wu School, was the deceased master that Chen Zhen, also played by Jet Li in Fist of Legend aswell as Bruce Lee in Fist of Fury, seeks to avenge.\n\n-With Fearless, Jet Li has now been filmed as all of the \"big three\" amongst the historical martial artists in Qing Dynasty (1645-1911) China, whose exploits has been novelized and dramatized many times. They are 1) Fang Shiyu (c.1700s) in the Fong Sai Yuk series, 2) Huo Yuanjia (1868-1910) in Fearless, and 3) Huang Feihong (1847-1924) in the Wong Fei Hung series.\n\nDrunken Master II - \"Old Wine in a New Bottle.\"\n\nRarely does a sequel ever surpass its predecessor. This is one of those rare cases. It's got everything the original had, and more. Anita Mui stands out for her hilarious performance as Wong Fei Hung's Mother, and the fight and action scenes are phenomenal, some of the BEST in the genre for sure. Ive seen this film dozens of times and i just never get tired of it. Its just that good. Keep in mind there are no Stuntmen, Wires, or CGI, everything Jackie does here and in most of his films are REAL. That's what makes him the BEST.\n\nJackie Chan was named the successor to Bruce, and its not because he copied his style, make no mistake, before the 1st Drunken Master he had his share of failed Bruce Lee Clone Projects, and it wasnt until he smartened up and did things HIS way did his career truly take off, everyone knows, there will never be another Bruce Lee, and as Jackie said himself, \"I dont want to be the next Bruce Lee, i want to be the first Jackie Chan.\"\n\nBased on the true story of real life martial arts master Yip Man. (the man who trained & taught Bruce Lee Wing Chun.)\n\nSo you think the Hulk is fierce when hes angry? Wait till you see Ip Man's reaction after witnessing a Japanese school of martial artists kill off one of his friends. His fists become the equivalent of an rapid fire machine gun.\n\nDonnie Yen FINALLY cements his place as one of the \"greats\" of the martial arts cinema world alongside Bruce, Jackie, Jet & Sammo among others. This is Easily Donnie Yen's BEST. The One he'll be remembered for...\n\nAn interesting bit of Trivia is that, although Donnie has been around since the 80's, 90s, and 00's, occasionally taking part in gems such as Hero & Iron monkey, it wasnt until this film did he achieve massive mainstream acceptance. In other words while his peers Jackie, Jet, & Sammo all peaked during their 20's, it wasnt until Donnie reached his late 30's did he reach his \"peak\" career wise with Ip Man. Some one even argue he only got better with age, which is a rare case in cinema period. This was the role he was born to play, and is currently continuing his winning streak by releasing some of the best martial arts movies today. After 3 decades in the business, and with Jackie & Jet releasing fewer and fewer action movies, he has finally earned the title as the top martial arts star in the world. A title first given to Bruce Lee, then to Jackie & Jet, And now on to Donnie.\n\nThe film that gained Bruce Lee World Wide Fame. He oozed charisma and stole every scene he was featured in.\n\nNO list is complete without this, this film is truly a landmark in Cinema, and at one point i personally considered the greatest kung fu movie ever.\n\nIn 2004, Enter the Dragon was deemed \"culturally significant\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nIts also worth noting all Three of the famous \"Dragon Brothers\" make appearances, Jackie Chan as Han's henchman in the cave, Biao Yuen as a Tournament Fighter, & Sammo Hung as the Shaolin fighter Bruce sparred with at the very beginning of the movie.\n\nTheir appearances are highlighted in this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z6z1b-q9u8\n\nTRIVIA:\n\nIn their one scene together, Lee actually struck Jackie Chan in the face with one of the fighting sticks he used. He immediately apologized and insisted that Chan would work on all of his movies after that, but he died before he could keep the promise.\n\nMore than just a martial arts film, this movie is a crime epic in every definition of the word. With a pinch of Scorcese/Tarantino influence this movie takes place right after the first and almost feels like a completely different type of film while still keeping it in the same world. (Think how Nolan transitioned Batman Begins to The Dark Knight). While the first film was set in one location and was mostly non stop action from start to finish, this one is twice as long as the Raid Redemption and twice as epic. There are more characters introduced, more development and story driven, and dont worry, it has as much action as the first, maybe more, I will have to see it another hundred times to determine that.\n\nAnyways, this is a sequel that joins the elite ranks of one of greatest action movies ever made IMO. Its even better than the original as hard as that is to believe. It takes all the bone smashing, jaw dropping fight scenes from its predecessor and builds on that.\n\nBeautifully shot, acted, and scored there really isnt much to say other than holy *beep* that was a *beep* awesome thrill ride of a movie.\n\nHighly recommended. ;)\n\nInspired by the \"Early Years\" of Legendary Martial Arts Figure and Grandmaster Wong Fei Hung.\n\nThis (along with Snake in Eagle's Shadow) are the two turning points in Jackie's Rich & Long History in 'the business.' He started off as a Stuntman and an extra appearing in blink and miss scenes in films that starred Bruce Lee & Sammo Hung. After Bruce's death he was just another face in the countless ocean of Bruce Lee clones, imitators who had no real future.\n\nIt wasnt until Jackie got a hold of his career and was given artistic freedom did he break free from all the other clones to set his own path to glory by his own style and terms.\n\nThis is a true classic and anyone and everyone whos even a little bit interested in the genre should grab a copy. Its got lots of the signature Jackie Humor, acrobatics, and choreography we all have come to love and expect from any and all of Jackie's Action pictures."
