Goodbye to the movies of 2023; you gave us superhero blockbusters, sequels, remakes, biopics, videogame adaptations, a smattering of auteur-driven masterpieces, some swing-and-a-miss epics, and a number of left-field surprises. Hello to the movies of 2024 — a collection of superhero blockbusters, sequels, remakes, biopics, videogame and Broadway musical adaptations, and Lady Gaga kicking ass as a supervillian clown.

We kid, because we love. Looking at the calendar of upcoming theatrical releases and streaming features over the next 12 months or so, we’re actually excited by a lot of what’s heading our way. Who wouldn’t want to check out George Miller’s follow-up to Fury Road? Or watch Ex Machina‘s Alex Garland imagine what the actual civil breakdown of our country would be like, assuming it’s not just a preview of what awaits us after November? Or hear Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo sing “Defying Gravity?” Or see Bob Marley’s legendary four-night run at London’s Rainbow Theatre get the same lavish recreation treatment as Queen’s Live-Aid performance in Bohemian Rhapsody? There’s plenty for film fanatics to look forward to catching over the next year. Here are the 50 movies we can’t wait to see in 2024. (Dates are subject to change.)
