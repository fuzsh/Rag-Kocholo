A list of 25 films that take place in Japan, from best to worst. A few other films, Jumper (2008), Ninja Assassin (2009), and Inception (2010) have a couple scenes that feature Japan in a cool way but it is not the primary setting of those movies. Will probably add Earthquake Bird (2019) to the list at some point.
