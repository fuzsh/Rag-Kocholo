As a result of the action of the German Government in announcing its determination to enter upon a course of submarine warfare, free from moral con­ siderations and free from the restraints of interna­ tional law, the President and the country are again confronted by a situation of extreme gravity. That this fact is everywhere recognized the course of the markets and the tenor of the public discussions since the announcement of the action have made abun­ dantly plain. What makes Germany’s action so serious is that it has been taken in face of, and in defiance of, the warning given by the President in the American note of last April. That warning was given in the Sussex case. It was explicit, direct and unequivocal. Within the last two days it has been quoted in every paper in the land and is as follows: “ Unless the Imperial Government should now immediately declare and effect an abandonment of its present methods of submarine warfare against passenger and freight-carrying vessels the Govern­ ment of the United States can have no choice but to sever diplomatic relations with the German Empire altogether. This action the Government ot the United States contemplates with the greatest reluc­ tance, but feels constrained to take in behalf of humanity and the rights of neutral nations. [Vol. 104. has been entirely on the side of the Entente. Phis was mainly because we admired the splendid way in which Great Britain came to the rescue of weak and defenseless Belgium. But now we learn that the object of the Entente countries is not merely repara­ tion and restoration, but involves an ambitious program of conquest and subjugation. Russia is to have Constantinople and among the other objects sought to be attained are “ The reorganization of Europe;” “ The restitution of provinces or territories wrested in the past from the Allies by force or against the will of their populations;” “ The liberation of Italians, of Slavs, of Rumanians and of TchecoSlovaques from foreign domination;” “ The expul­ sion from Europe of the Ottoman Empire, &c. &c. Do we want to engage in long years of war in order to help achieve these ends? And if we are not to fight in common with the Allies, how are we to conduct our fight all alone against Germany ? Many similar questions might be asked, all going to show that it will be well for us to look before we leap, and that severance of relations should not be treated as the necessary preliminary to war. To what we said last week of the proposed excess profits” tax a little may be appropriately added. The proposition is an income tax, but possessing every vice of such a tax without any of the merits which that form of direct levy may contain. An in­ come tax must needs be paid by those who have incomes, but this proposal carries discrimination and Thus Germany has acted with a knowledge of the espionage and difficulty of ascertainment even consequences, and must be assumed to be prepared farther than the tax we already have, whose screws to take these consequences. Certainly German have already been set for a severer turn, the force of officialdom cannot have entertained the fatuous which will presently begin to be realized. There is notion that the President would stultify himself by something to be said on behalf of a regular income recanting utterances like these or withdraw from tax in that it falls, in some instances, upon incomes a position to which he so unreservedly committed which are not earned by any personal services or the United States, or that the country would allow labor; but this is avowedly leveled at profits of him to so stultify himself even if he were so inclined. business, upon the effective results of capital and It follows that when the German Government de­ termined upon its present course, it must have surplus in work. The discriminations proposed are even more reckoned upon the breaking off ot diplomatic rela­ vicious, if possible, than the present income tax tions between the United States and Germany as contains. The treatment seems indeed, we may a foregone conclusion. say is—distinctly punitive. The punitive thought Supposing relations broken o ff, what next l Must appears also in the proposed exemptions; to pass we proceed a step further and actually enter into over receipts from professional services, to leave out war? Obviously, with diplomatic intercourse sev­ the agriculturists, and (as before) the huge mass of ered, the possibility of war will ever be present. A wage-earners— this repeats the vice of appealing to single overt act on the part of a blundering or an the selfishness of the overwhelming majority ot obstinate German might bring hostilities at any voters by the suggestion “ it don’t touch me.” Over moment. Yet, war is so dreadful that all means and over it needs to be pointed out (for such an should be employed to avert such a calamity, if it unanswerable statement must surely begin to take can be done without surrender of principle or the hold of men’s reason and consciences some day) sacrifice of national honor. that the only safe income tax is one which falls, at Many considerations obtrude themselves in con­ least as to requiring attention and the making of nection with the matter, whether we choose to regard returns, upon every self-supporting person.

The Consider also whether we could afford to commit only sound income tax is one that seeks out every­ ourselves unreservedly to the cause of the Entente body, and the most facile implement for waste is a group. scheme which plucks a few and suggests to the mass Has not the recent declaration of purpose by the that they may get some largess out of what “ the Entente, in replying to the President’s request for a statement of aims and objects on the part of the two rich” are made to give up.

Grant that the funds are to be used, States to throw in its lot with the Entente? From and are needed, for “ preparedness,” it is in no degree the first, intelligent public sentiment in this country Feb . 3 1917.] THE CHRONICLE true that the wealthier and the great commercial States are especially (or exclusively) interested in national defense. Nobody doubts that an enemy fleet would seek this city first; but to intimate, or to imagine, that a blow upon the metropolis would not be felt in North Carolina and everywhere else is to continue the notion that this city belongs to and serves itself and not the entire country. To put any such notion and any such plea into unmistakable words is enough to condemn it; we need not argue about it. It is not true that there has been any especial demand for preparedness in the Northeast, or, if there has been any special appreciation of a possible exposure there it is because the coastal States realize most what an attack might involve, also that distance and an interior location do not long protect. It is not true, unhappily, that whoever pays this proposed new tax will know he is not paying it for “ pork” but that “ every dollar is going for the very purpose” for which there is said to have been a clamour. This is what he will not know. The “ pork” bill has passed the House, despite all said, and though it may be halted in the other branch there is no effective movement, as yet, towards any cutting off of lavish squandering in many directions. The demand for outpouring is unabated, and the sole thought is for ways to extort more money, not one serious indica­ tion of a resolve to cut off the flood of waste. Once more, admitting that defensive outlays are needed and on an increased scale, businesslike and efficient propositions and methods should be the first step therein. Note the armor-plate plants, the nitrate plants, the Shipping Bill, the constant ac­ quiescence in the reduction of output by organized labor in all Government work— taxation might be pushed to the extreme of confiscation and an open revolt by the victims and still there would be no real defensive preparedness, if there is not to be “ busi­ ness,” instead of partisan truckling, in the Govern­ mental operations. Gold flung into the sea of illdirected spending will not protect the country. The old strange notion persists, and reappears under this measure, that “ business” is inherently wicked and will never get quite drastically enough dealt with for its faults. Why professional services, labor for daily or weekly wage, and cultivating the soil can be deemed particularly unselfish and pure but the conversion of raw materials into more ad­ vanced products and trading generally are deemed comparatively selfish and menacing, is a mystery. It seems to be fixed, having been taken up without thought; but it needs to be dislodged and cast away. One reason is that business men and interests, as the “ Chronicle” has repeatedly pointed out, have been too meekly and indifferently unresistant, not pro­ testing, not standing and speaking boldly, but accept­ ing and awaiting whatever might be dealt out to them. Some indications appear of the stir and action we urged, last week, and if business does not awake it must accept the blame, for when men do not move to defend themselves they should expect to be gradually believed to have no defense. A refusal to plead is more likely to be judged confession than otherwise. The market for securities in New York, as well as the various commodity markets, received a severe shock on Thursday when the official announcement was published of Germany’s intention to conduct in 387 future an “ unrestricted submarine warfare.” The information had become public after the close of business on Wednesday. Initial prices on the Stock Exchange indicated declines of 5 to 15 points in many of the leading securities. While there were recoveries later, the condition remained a highly nervous and apprehensive one, and yesterday there was renewed depression. On the Cotton Exchange one of the most sensational breaks in the history of the staple took place, M ay delivery, for instance, de­ clining as low as 1 2 ^ cents, representing a precipitate bieak of more than 5 cents per pound. In the grain markets the first shock produced reductions of 7]/^ to 15 cents, though subsequently some recoveries took place. On business, as a whole, the effect was to produce a waiting attitude. We give the text of the German communications elsewhere in this issue. The note signed by the German Ambassador at Washington and addressed to Secretary Lansing announces Germany’s pur­ pose to cast aside “ the restrictions” which she claims until now have been impressed upon the use of her full sea power. The step it is explained is taken because of the failure of the movement of Germany and her allies to bring about peace “ owing to the lust for conquest of their enemies.” A star­ vation blockade has been established and all traffic by sea either neutral or enemy within a specified zone is to be summarily prohibited if present plans are carried out to the letter. A sea cordon has been mapped out running from the Terschelling Light­ ship off the Dutch coast in the North Sea north­ ward to a point off the coast of Norway, thence west into the Atlantic and south along the French coast; also in the Mediterranean except the western part adjacent to the Spanish coast down into Greek tonitorial waters. In this zone neutral govern­ ments have been warned that their ships will ply from beb. 1 at their own risk. Under prescribed conditions regular American transatlantic passen­ ger steamers may continue their trips to England if Falmouth is made their port of destination and a certain lane which will not be mined is used by them. Only one steamer may run each week to and from the United States. The United States Government is requested to guarantee that they shall carry no contraband. The full import of the communication is recognized at Washington, and it will be dealt with presumably at the eailiest possible moment. Alcan while owners of American ships are asking instructions from our Government. . The agents of the American Line steamer St. Louis, which was to have sailed for Liverpool to-day, have been requested by Washing­ ton authorities to delay the steamer’s departure until further notice. A significant feature of this latest German action is that it ends at one stroke all negotiations that have been going on concerning the various violations by German submarines of international law. Ihe Lusitania settlement can hardly go further, for instance, and the various other discussions, for practical purposes at least may as well be abandoned, since the present atti­ tude of the Kaiser s Government is that there will be no recognition on its part of anything but the law of necessity. The pledges that only cruiser warfare would be conducted now have been with­ drawn and ruthlessness is the policy. The effect of the news in the various Entente countries does not appear to have been the demorali­ 388 THE CHRONICLE zation that undoubtedly was expected. As to the merchantmen of the Allied Powers, the situation does not appear to have been in a practical, sense at least, changed. German submarines have been working actively and have permitted very few vessels to es­ cape as a result of attempts to warn them. The burden of the new announcement will, of course, bear very largely upon the merchantmen of neu­ tral countries. So far as British and other En­ tente ships are concerned, they seem to be pro­ ceeding as a settled route along our Atlantic coast as near as possible in the three-mile limit to Halifax and then to be crossing the ocean in a specific lane virtually under convoy of warships. How they will be able to avoid the mines and the enemy submarines when they’ near their destination is the great problem. It is evident, therefore, that the occupation of sea­ farers has become one of extremely dangerous charac­ ter. Former Premier Asquith, addressing a meeting of his constituents at Ladybank, Scotland, declared that it was “ impossible to dispute the gravity of the situation” when commenting on the new German order. “ But with the navy supplementing such other measures as the arming of merchantmen and the acceleration of new tonnage, we may hope to counteract it. All our thoughts and energies,” he continued, “ shall be concentrated on the effective prosecution of the war to a decisive end. The notion about it ending in stalemate is an idle dream. Each year finds success nearer for the Allies.” The German view of the situation seems to be most accurately set forth in the address the Imperial Chancellor, Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, made on Wednesday before the Reichstag Ways and Means Committee. As reported by way of Amsterdam, the Chancellor explained that the German peace offer had been scorned and Germany had been challenged to fight to the end. “ We accept the challenge, we stake everything and shall be victoriou s/’ he said. Refer­ ring to the submarine policy the Chancellor con­ tinued: “ Every means, I said in March, that was calculated to shorten the war constitute the most humane policy to follow. When the most ruthless methods are considered best calculated to lead us to victory, and swift victory, I said then they must be employed. This moment has now arrived. Last autumn the time was not yet ripe, but to-day the moment has come when with the greatest prospect of success we can undertake the enterprise. We must therefore not wait any longer.” Still further the Chancellor said: “ The military situation as a whole permits us to accept all the consequences which unrestricted U-boat war may bring, and as this U-boat war is the means of injuring our enemies the most grievously it must be begun. . . . N o one among us will close his eyes to the seriousness of the step we are taking. That our existence is at stake every one knows since August 4 1914, and this has been brutally emphasized by the rejection of our peace offer. When in 1914 we had to seize and have recourse to the sword against Russia’s general mo­ bilization, we did so with the deepest sense of respon­ sibility toward our people and conscious of our reso­ lute strength which says ‘we must, and therefore we can.’ Endless streams of blood have since been shed but they have not washed away the ‘must1 and the ‘can.’ In now deciding to employ our best and sharpest weapon we are guided solely by sober con­ [Vol. 104. sideration of all the circumstances that come into the question and by the firm determination to help our people out of the distress and disgrace which our enemies contemplate for them. Success lies in a higher hand, but as regards all that human strength can do to enforce success for the Fatherland, be assured, gentlemen, that nothing has been neglected. Everything in this respect will be done.” The cables have brought very little in the way of definite news of military or naval operations this week. Ten ships were reported to have been sunk on Feb. 1, the first day of Germany’s new “ danger zone” campaign, and several more were reported to have been sunk yesterday afternoon. The repulse of the German infantry attack on the Belgian sector of the west front was reported on Tuesday. On the Somme front the British report that they have car­ ried out successful night raids near the Butte de Warlencourt. Thus far the French have not appar­ ently been able to recapture the trenches recently taken from them by the Germans in the region of Hill 304 in the Verdun sector. The net results in other fields of operation do not appear to have been important. Reports to which we referred last week that the British Treasury had arranged to mobilize all for­ eign securities on much the same lines as those affecting the accumulation of English-owned Ameri­ can securities appear to have been misunderstood both here and at the British centre. An official statement on Wednesday gave the new regulations in full. These show that under strict conditions which are definitely enumerated, foreign, colonial and Indian securities which have been in the phy­ sical possession of holders in the United Kingdom and not in the possession of any subject of an enemy Power since the outbreak of the war, may be sold in the United States, Canada or Newfoundland provided the proceeds from such sales are remitted to England immediately and invested there. An­ other regulation forbids the sale in any foreign country or British possession of any United States, Canadian or Newfoundland securities. It, however, permits Indian, colonial and other foreign securities except American, Canadian and Newfoundland is­ sues to be sold abroad under the same conditions, namely that the proceeds be invested at home. The regulations provide also strict rules for the shipment of securities so sold to North America. The object of the mobilization is to shut off such exports of securities as would if not interfered with prove detrimental to the foreign exchanges. The in­ structions regarding sales specify that a dollar draft must be drawn on a New York, Canadian or New­ foundland house and negotiated in the United King­ dom with an approved exchange agent, together with the securities and a certificate declaring the draft represents the full sale price of the securities delivered. While call funds in London are still quoted at 33^% there seems to be a somewhat firmer tone in money circles. This is not unnatural in view of the large applications that have been made from all parts of the United Kingdom for participation in the new war loan, the subscription books for which close Feb. 12. The Bank of England is said to be holding back funds in order to maintain money rates. A concession that is intended to popularize the war Feb . 3 1917.] THE CHRONICLE loan provides for the abolition of virtually all transfer fees on Government securities. While the loan is undoubtedly going very well, over-enthusiastic esti­ mates are being officially deprecated, experience having shown that big estimates, to quote one cor­ respondent, encourage “ slackers.” Press advices state that the feature of the loan has been the amounts subscribed for by insurance companies, which exceed $215,000,000. The Prudential heads the list with $100,000,000. Lady Wernhcr, who inherited great wealth from her husband, Sir Julius Wernhcr, the South African diamond and gold miner, is so far the largest individual subscriber, having in­ vested $10,000,000. The large subscribers include: 389 on which thelindex number is [based [is 2200; thus the advancejiow recorded is more than 125% above that average. The Paris Bourse has shown slight activity this week and the tone of the markets does not appear to have been affected adversely by the German submarine note. A maximum increase in railroad rates of 15% has been proposed. All French ves­ sels above 1,000 tons now are subject to State con­ trol.

This is the first time that this form of investment has been offered directly to individual investors.

Sixty and ninety days’ endorsed bills receivable and six months’ names of choice character have ruled at the lower levels recently established, namely, 3 % @ 3 % % , with a substantial amount of the business passing at the lower figure.

In sterling exchange circles rates still are arbitrarily maintained, just as they have been for nearly two years. Fluctuations in quotations are so slight as to be meaningless. The German submarine note, if the market had not been under such complete control, might have exercised some appreciable influence, owing to the prospects that exportations of American products might be more or less interfered with. There was, however, no important response to this factor. The British Government has by a new order arranged for the mobilization of additional foreign securities with a view of assisting in the maintenance of English exchanges. There have been large de­ posits of American funds in London banks since the first of the year, some estimates placing the amount at about $400,000,000. Money conditions at home here are not sufficiently attractive to induce the return of any of these funds. But, of course, the situation may change when the bond and note issues provided by the new Revenue bill shall be offered for subscription. Furthermore, in the event of the new crisis between Washington and Berlin developing into an actual break our own Government borrowing would be correspondingly increased, and money would command higher rental rates. Comparing with Friday of the previous week, sterling exchange on Saturday was quiet and prac­ tically unchanged; demand bills were quoted at 4 75% @ 4 7577%, against 4 7 5 % @ 4 7580, while cable The continental exchanges have again shown ner­ vousness and irregularity. During the earlier days of the week Italian lire were once more conspicuous for weakness. A continued absence of buying power forced the quotation down to still lower levels— sight bills on Wednesday dropping to the unprecedentedly low figure of 7.30— while rumors stating that Italy’s finances are in a somewhat less favorable condition than formerly were an additional source of depres­ sion. Rubles also ruled heavy and German and Austrian exchange, as a result of selling supposedly for. speculative account, registered substantial de­ clines. On Thursday the unexpected and startling announcement of Germany’s determination to in­ augurate a “ ruthless” submarine warfare, thereby breaking pledges with the United States and once again opening the question of a severance of diplo­ matic relations, exercised a generally depressing effect, particularly upon reichsmarks, which broke to 66% , a decline of 3 % points from the quotation ruling on Saturday. Demand bills on -Berlin finished at 67% and cables at 67% , against 69% and 69% a week ago. Kronen, which also broke sharply on the German note, closed at 10.75, which con­ trasts with 11.08 on Friday of last week. The sterling check rate on Paris continues to rule at 27.81%, unchanged. In New York sight bills on the French centre closed at 5 84% , against 5 84% ; cables at 5 83% , -against 5 83% ; commercial sight at 5 84% , against 5 84% , and commercial sixty days at 5 89% , against 5 89 the week preceding. Rubles finished at 28 60, against 28 60 a week ago. Lire continued their downward course and closed at 7 28 for bankers’ sight and 7 27 for cables. This compares with 7 09 and 7 08, the final quotation on Friday of last week. In th e n e u tra l p a s s in g .
