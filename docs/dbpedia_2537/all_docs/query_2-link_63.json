        "text": "In the field of media development, the public sector is often viewed as a barrier to the development of independent and sustainable media. Although governments do frequently pervert and capture media sectors in countries around the globe, the enabling conditions under which media can achieve and maintain independence are nevertheless reliant on institutions of government. Therefore the media development community must rethink its approaches to public sector engagement in efforts to improve the environment for media systems in emerging and fragile democracies. This paper outlines the key role of political support, the need for more nuanced understanding of political context, and how donors and implementers can more effectively engage drivers of change in the public sector to build support for media and media development work.\n\nSituating grassroots autonomous media within complex contemporary media ecologies and protest movements, this article uses resilience theory to critically analyse the characteristics generative of adaptive capacity in alternative media. The organizing structures, decision-making processes and social movement strategies of two case studies – Concordia University TV (CUTV) and the Montreal Media Co-op – are analysed using online self-produced media materials and participant observation during the 2012 Quebec Student Strike. Both groups have existed for more than ten years, achieving a balance between anti-authoritarian militant activist culture and formal organizational structure. We find they are open to remediation and reconfiguration as needed, including adapting new technologies and organizing journalism teams and peer-to-peer training of volunteers. In addition, these forms of ‘direct action journalism’ exhibit professionalism beyond the basic amateurism of most citizen journalism. Some of the characteristics of grassroots autonomous media production in which resilience may be cultivated include anti-authoritarian militant spaces such as CUTV’s media lab, formalized organizational structures with mixed funding models such as the Media Co-op’s multi-stakeholder cooperative, and deeper relationships and networks with social movements exhibited by both, including reconfigured horizontal relationships among media producers and users.\n\nA participatory action research study of anti-authoritarian activist media practices in Quebec, Canada was carried out by the Collectif de Recherche sur l’Autonomie Collective. Analysing interviews from 117 participants in nine activist groups and networks, we have found that grassroots anti-authoritarian and anarchist activists engage in a diversity of media tactics, choosing tools consistent with their desired goals and audiences. These goals can be grouped into four categories: developing affinity, creating social movement spaces, mass mobilizations and global solidarity. These communicative tactics in the activist ‘repertoire of communication’ are informed by several important commitments to alternative content and processes, including collective self-representation, prefigurative politics and accessibility. We conclude that grassroots autonomous activists sometimes limit the reach of their media to create safer spaces, or to deepen and extend their political analysis, and they sometimes produce media for wider audiences, for local mass mobilizations or to develop global relationships of solidarity. This deepens our understanding of the specific diversity of tactics developed by grassroots autonomous media activists in their repertories of communicative action, challenging received notions that anarchist or antiauthoritarian media only ever reach a limited audience.\n\nIn this commentary, we discuss how five prominent media development organizations (BBC Media Action, Council of Europe, DWA, PMA and UNESCO) define public service broadcasting (PSB)/public service media (PSM) and how they envisage its role and functions in their recent projects and reports. In view of the increasing challenges of the current media landscape, international donors are looking at models to provide a path to independent media and journalism and several international organizations support projects and institutional arrangements they label PSB/PSM. However, given the fundamental questions that existing PSBs face, is PSB a meaningful tool for media development? And how do these various advocates for PSB/PSM understand the concept and why do they feel that it is worth supporting? We find that there seems to have been a shift, common to all five organizations, towards defining PSB/PSM in terms of public service ethos, and we explain why this should be seen as a welcome devel...\n\nThis article explores how a listening approach might address the complex challenges of researching the relationship between Indigenous participation in media and mainstream policy-making processes. An overview of contemporary Indigenous media demonstrates how digital and social media have built on the vibrant and innovative Indigenous media tradition, and enabled a proliferation of new Indigenous voices. But do the powerful listen to Indigenous-produced media, and does this constitute meaningful participation in the political process? The article distinguishes between participation as involvement in the production and dissemination of media, and participation as political influence. It argues that both meanings are crucial for fully realising the potential of Indigenous participatory media, and contends that a listening approach might offer ways to research and unlock the democratic potential of Indigenous media participation.\n\nOver the past two decades, Marc Edge has justifiably earned a reputation as a leading voice in Canadian media and journalism studies. It is no exaggeration to conclude that this has been a period of intense upheaval and crisis in Canadian media during which many of Edge’s worst fears have been realized. However, The News We Deserve amounts to more than an expert chronicle of the decline and fall of Canada’s once internationally respected print and electronic communication systems. It is as much a set of hopeful visions of what journalism excellence and a media service committed to the public interest and democracy can be, when it is properly managed and regulated."
