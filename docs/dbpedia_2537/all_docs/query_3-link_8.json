The most obvious comment upon the events of this week, where the President has been exerting all his energies to prevent a tie-up of the transportation facilities of the entire country, is, that it is matter for deep regret that by reason of mistaken methods of dealing with the issue, things should have been allowed to reach such a pass. Irrespective entirely of the merits of the contentions of the two sides, it is an intolerable and a humiliating situation that permits a body of railway employees deliberately to declare that they will paralyze completely the country’s industrial activities unless certain demands presented in the shape of an ultimatum are uncondi­ tionally granted. Such a situation could not have arisen if the several hundred roads concerned had not mistakenly pooled their issues, but had instead dealt with the demands each in its own way. Then at the worst there could have been the possibility merely of a series of small strikes which it would be easy to grapple with. That the trainmen desired the bulk method of considering the controversy, was no reason why the railroads should acquiesce in it to their own detriment and that of the public. The different brotherhoods had every­ thing to gain from such a course, for they thereby solidified their power, while the roads had every­ thing to lose. The inevitable has followed. The railroads are being treated as the under-dog, and all the pressure conceivable, political and otherwise, is being brought to bear against them, with the view to compelling them to yield regardless of consequences. But who in his senses could have expected anything else? Manifestly, with the country threatened with a general railroad strike, the President would have been doing less than his duty had he not actively intervened to prevent such a dire calamity. It does not follow, however, that having intervened, his conclusions should be accepted without demur if they are palpably unjust to one of the parties to the controversy. In this case, the railroads are asked to surrender two most vital points: (1) The question of the feasibility of an eight-hour day, and (2) The principle of arbitration. The truth is, the trainmen are not really contending for an eight hour day, as they would have the public believe, but are seeking to obtain an eight hour basing day. I he time of the trainmen is measured by runs, as a rule, so many miles constituting a run. Often the run is completed in considerably less than eight hours, but these trainmen would have it that a run, no matter how slow, shall not exceed eight hours and that the pay for these eight hours shall be the same as the present pay for ten hours, and that if it is not possible to arrange train schedules so as •to cover the run in eight hours, then the railroads shall be further penalized by being obliged to pay time and a half lor the extra time beyond the eight hour basing day. II a locomotive engineer now makes $6 for a run taking ten hours, or at the rate of 60 cents an hour, he would have to be given $6 for eight hours’ work, or at the rate of 75 cents an hour, while for the other two hours he would have to be paid not merely 7o cents an hour or 51 50 for the two hours, but time and a half for the two hours, which would make 52 25, or 58 25 altogether for the ten hours, for which the pay is now 56. The compromise suggested by the President would compel the roads to yield as to everything except the demand to pay time and a half for overtime. The President would let the roads off with the requirement that they pay merely pro rata on the higher basis for extra hours. But even on that basis an engineer now getting 56 would have to be paid 57 50. The railroads insist that to accede to the demands of the brotherhoods in the case of the engineers and the other trainmen would mean an additional expense to the railroads of 5100,000,000 per annum, and they contend that it is out of the question for them to assume any such added burden. They are willing, nevertheless, to leave the whole question to the deci­ sion of arbitrators—Reeling so thoroughly convinced of the justice of their cause. The employees, how­ ever, insist that the eight hour basing day must be granted in any event, that they will not submit to arbitration at all on that point, and in this the President is backing them up. They are averse to arbitration as to any of their demands, but out of deference to the President they will consent to arbitrate, or yield altogether for the time being, on the point of time and a half for overtime. It would seem that the railroads are on impregnable ground when they insist that the most they should be asked to do is to submit the whole controversy to arbitration. And obviously, as far as the position of the brotherhoods is concerned, a cause must be weak indeed if its advocates dare not abide by the results of disinterested arbitration. Under the attitude assumed by the President the position of the railroads is a helpless one, and in addition press comment has been to the effect that in a matter of this kind the President represents the whole people and is the final authority; therefore, his judgment must be implicitly accepted. But the matter has another aspect which the public press apd every one else is conveniently choosing to ignore. The present strike movement is clearly il­ legal and as the President is sworn to obey and exe­ cute the laws he has here a duty to perform as impera­ tive as in the other case. As has been previously pointed out by us, several different railway men’s organizations (the Brotherhood of Locomotive En­ gineers, the Order of Railway Conductors, the Broth­ erhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen) have joined forces and made a simultaneous demand upon all the roads of the country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Canadian border to the Mexican frontier. Thus we have a conspiracy on a gigantic scale to compel compliance with the demands of the employees. Four different brotherhoods in three distinct geo­ graphical sections of the country— in effect twelve different bodies of railroad employees— have com­ bined with the idea that by making a simultaneous demand upon all the railroads in the United States resistance upon the part of the roads will become practically impossible, since the alternative is to bo a strike with the tying up of the country’s entire transportation facilities, an alternative the railroads cannot afford to face, it is thought, by reason of the distress it would occasion and the industrial paralysis it would produce. If the President had done his full duty in the prem­ ises he would have nipped this conspiracy in the bud. In saying this we do not overlook the fact that the Clayton Anti-Trust Law of October 1914 grants certain immunities and exemptions to labor organiza- tions. As previously pointed out by us, Section 6 of the Clayton law provides that “ nothing contained in the anti-trust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor, agricultural or horticultural organizations, instituted for the pur­ poses of mutual help * * * or to forbid or re­ strain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations or the members thereof be held or construed to be illegal combina­ tions or conspiracies in restraint of trade under the anti-trust laws.” In other respects, however, labor organizations still remain subject to the law, and when four great labor organizations, operating in several different sections of the country, combine with the view to coercing the railroads into granting a demand for higher pay, they are plainly engaged in a conspiracy which the law forbids and condemns. It is equally a violation of the law for the railroads, on their part, to combine in an attempt to hold down the price of railway labor. It will be remembered that we have criticised railroad managers for falling in with the demands of the brotherhoods and agreeing to the request of the latter (made of each one of the separate roads) that it “ join with other railway managements in the United States and enter into a collective movement for the purpose of handling this proposition at one and the same time through a joint committee representing all railroads con­ cerned.” We have urged from the first that to accede to this request was wrong both in law and as a matter of policy. What the President ought to have done, therefore, was to have notified these labor leaders,who are en­ gaged in a conspiracy against the safety and welfare of the public on a scale never before attempted in labor annals, that unless they desisted from their purpose he would instruct the Attorney-General im­ mediately to begin proceedings against them under the criminal section of the Anti-Trust Law; and he ought to have served a similar warning upon those acting for the railroads. Of course, there was never the least likelihood that the labor leaders would be brought to book in this way. This is the year of a Presidential elec­ tion and a move of that kind against labor unions would be most unpopular. Hence, it was entirely safe for the heads of the brotherhoods to persist, until now they have succeeded in bringing about a situation where they can, through the President himself, compel complete surrender on the part of the railroads. But why the railroad managers should have lent such effective aid in a movement for their own un­ doing— whose end, too, could be so clearly foreseen— must always remain a mystery. The menace to which they are now obliged to succumb could have been obviated if they had declined to accede to the demands of the brotherhoods for concerted consider­ ation of the questions at issue and had insisted on reverting to the old practice of each road determining labor questions for itself and in its own way, wholly without regard to the course of other roads or sys­ tems. In that way, whatever trouble or conflict might arise, would necessarily be confined to one system at a time. In such a contingency, a whole­ sale or general strike would be altogether out of the question. Entirely apart from the illegality of the action, is it not clear that it has been the gravest kind of a blunder to let the employees carry out their design of being able to hold the entire country in complete subjection by reason of the possession of the power to order a wholesale strike which must bring all industrial operations to a standstill? Having acquired the power they were bound to use it as a threat for attaining their ends. The railroads, on their part, will be obliged to pay the penalty for the mistakes of their managers. The result was a fore­ gone conclusion from the start. Transvaal gold mining operations in July were not upon the full scale witnessed in earlier months of the current calendar year. The per diem output, in fact, showed a falling off from June and was, moreover, the smallest of any month since April 1915. The latest month’s production is announced by cable as 761,087 fine ounces, or a daily average of 24,548 fine ounces, this comparing with 770,355 fine ounces and 24,848 fine ounces in 1915 and 732,485 fine ounces and 23,628 fine ounces in 1914. The seven months’ yield in 1916, however, stands at 5,392,954 fine ounces, or 214,551 fine ounces more than for the period in 1915 and 97,144 fine ounces greater than in 1913. The Fall River cotton mills dividend record for the third quarter of 1916 reflects the more satisfac­ tory conditions recently prevailing at that important centre of the cotton-manufacturing industry, the aggregate amount slated to be distributed among the stockholders being close to double the total paid out during the second quarter of the year. This large excess, it is to be noted, however, is in considerable measure due to the payment of an extra dividend out of accumulated profits by the Union Cotton M fg. Co., but at the same time several corporations have increased their rates of distribution and two mills have resumed payment. In all, the shareholders in the mills will receive for the third quarter of 1916 a total of $798,425, or an average of 2.63% on the capital invested, as against only $268,542, or 0.89% , in the like period a year ago, $291,167, or 0.99% , in 1914, and $352,675, or 1.21%, in 1913. For the nine months of the current calendar year, moreover, the aggregate distribution of $1,550,517 and the average of 5.11% are the most satisfactory in several years, comparing as they do with $785,342, or 2.64% , in 1915, and $960,501, or 3.25% , in 1914. Between 1907 and 1910, both years inclusive, the nine months’ rate of distribution ranged from 5.23% to 7.27% — the latter the high record at Fall River— and the low­ est figure of which we have knowledge is the 1.33% of 1898. Building operations in the United States continue to reflect the generally favorable mercantile and industrial situation of the country, but at the same time there was in July a letup in some localities in the conspicuous activity that had characterized most recent months. On the other hand the striking feature of the exhibit for July is the phenom­ enal amount arranged to be expended under the permits issued for construction work in the Borough of Manhattan, Greater New York— an amount over ten times that of the same month in 1915, $49,205,­ 220, comparing with $4,845,303. The explanation for this enormous increase, however, is not far to seek. It is to be found in the action of the Board i of Estimate of the city in adopting a building regula tion plan that became effective July 25. Under that plan restrictions are placed upon the height of buildings, and to escape these many builders of intended skyscrapers hurriedly filed their plans prior to the date mentioned. It is therefore entirely probable that some of the projects, if not many, will never reach realization, or in any event, will be long delayed in being carried out. This was the result in Chicago in 1911, when the filing of projects was hastened in order to take advantage of the old building laws which were less restrictive than the new that went into effect September 1 of that year. The estimated cost covered by the permits issued in July in Greater New York is very much in excess of a year ago— in fact, $54,478,435, against$13,084,725— and entirely due to the tremendous gain in Manhattan referred to above, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens all showing decreases, and operations in Richmond being too small to have any real effect on the result. Outside of this city the work arranged for under the contracts entered into involves an approximate outlay of $63,313,389, or 5 millions more than in 1915, but shows a decline of moderate proportions from 1914. Rather conspicuous gains are recorded at some of the larger cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minne­ apolis, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Rochester, Seattle and Atlanta, with a few of the smaller municipalities showing quite radical percentages, but decreases are large at Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Syracuse, Albany, Bridgeport and Worcester in the East; New Orleans, Dallas and Houston at the South; and Cincinnati, Kansas City, Louisville and Akron in the West. In most cases, however, they follow marked earlier activity. Including New York, the aggregate for 161 cities is $117,791,824, against $71,­ 405,471 for July 1915 and 84 millions in 1914. For the seven months of 1916 the projected expendi­ ture at the identical 161 cities is the heaviest on record. As we compile the result it totals $617,­ 080,050, against $466,450,886 for the period in 1915 and about 540 millions in 1914. Greater New York’s operations at 168% millions contrasts with 107% millions and 94% millions, respectively, in the two preceding years, and for the outside cities the aggre­ gate at 449 millions exceed 1915 by 90 millions. Each group of cities into which we have segregated the returns records an increase over last year for the seven-months period, with the excess most pro­ nounced in the Middle West and Far West (not including the Pacific States). Little is to be said of building construction work in the Dominion of Canada, except that a return of anything bordering upon general activity is yet to be experienced. Thirty-one cities in the Eastern Provinces furnish for July this year a total of in­ tended outlay of $2,888,447, against $2,200,749 a year ago, and for 18 Western municipalities the comparison is between $574,772 and $667,240. The aggregate of all (49 cities) is, therefore, $3,­ 463,219, against $2,869,989, with the 1914 total some 12% millions. For the seven months the contemplated expenditure shows only a very slight increase over the greatly restricted total of a year ago, and a decided drop from 1914. In the East the total at $16,726,478 contrasts with $15,924,648 and 45 millions and in the West $3,775,893 with $3,580,156 and 28 millions. Consequently, for the period since January 1 the 49 cities have arranged to expend in construction work. $20,502,371, against $19,504,804 a year ago and over 73 millions in 1914, with the 1913 aggregate in excess of 90 millions. The national progress that is being so steadily made in Russia is suggested by a report that has just become available by cable from Petrograd, showing the increase of popular savings in the Russian banks. The deposits in these institutions so far in 1916 are considerably greater than for all preceding years. In the first quarter of 1916 direct taxation produced more than 103,000,000 rubles, exceeding the yield of 1915 by more than 10,500,000 rubles. Indirect taxation produced 174,000,000 rubles, which is 78,­ 500,000 more than in 1915. Returns from domains and from securities owned by the Russian Financial Administration amounted to 266,000,000 rubles, which is 65,000,000 in excess of last year. Ordinary revenue amounts thus far in 1916 to 781,444,000 ru­ bles, exceeding the revenue in 1915 by 232,795,000 rubles. Russian exports in the first five months of 1916 amounted to 151,766,000 rubles, a gain of 60,000,000 rubles. Imports in the same period reached the total of 641,000,000, an increase of 410,­ 000,000 rubles. There seems slight indication of any substantial modification by the English Government in its blacklist policy. Discussing this matter with American newspaper correspondents, Lord Robert Cecil', Minister of War Trade, stated that there was not likely to be any change as the result of neutral protests. Italy, by her action in adopting a black­ list, he added, is merely following the policy out­ lined at the Paris conference. Lord Robert con­ firmed reports published recently in financial circles that outstanding contracts of British insurance companies with firms on the blacklist will not be interfered with by the Government. The speaker said there had been no change in the policy of Great Britain regarding the Netherlands Overseas Trust. “ I do not know the facts upon which American shippers are basing their complaints,” he said, “ but I can assure you that we have not changed our attitude toward the Trust. I can explain, however, a possible detention, on the clause of the agreement which specifies that the Government has a right to detain any Trust consignment until doubt as to its destination has been satisfactorily explained. The Conference Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives at Washington have agreed upon a compromise on the bill giving a greater meas­ ure of self-government to the Philippine Islands. This agreement has already been confirmed by the Senate, and will no doubt pass the House in due course. A proposed amendment providing for the independence of the Philippines after two and within four years was eliminated from the measure, but the preamble still recites that it is now and always has been the intention of the United States to grant independence when a stable government, has been established. In lieu of the present Philippine Com­ mission which is abolished by the bill, it is provided that the Filipinos shall elect a Senate, the first elec­ tion to take place next month. The House*already is elected by the people. With the election of the Senate the electorate will be increased by about 600,000. About 200,000 Filipinos vote now and a new law will grant voting rights to about 800,000. The office of Governor-General is to be retained, and there is to be a Vice-Governor who will be an American, whose duties are to be fixed by the Governor-General. The functions of the Legis­ lature are limited to provide that the coinage, cur­ rency and immigration laws shall not be made with­ out the approval of the President of the United States. All Americans residing in the Islands who desire to exercise the voting privilege must become citizens of the Philippine Islands. While the Entente Powers are continuing their concerted drives, there has been a noticeable slacken­ ing down in the actual net gain and it is beginning to look as though a new stage of the so-called Battle of Europe had finally been reached. The Germans contend that the battle of the Somme, which has now completed its seventh week, has failed since it has not resulted in piercing the German lines. Never­ theless, it is clear that the offensive in the Somme sector is to be kept up. Nearly every day brings word of new even though minor successes. This is quite in line with the strategy that the war critics claim is being carried out so consistently by the Allies, namely, of attacking in the West with a view of preventing reserves being forwarded to resist the onslaught of the Itussians in the East, where there has been such striking progress in East and South by the Russians and Italians. Heavy attacks were made by the French on Thurdsay night on the Verdun front. After violent fighting at Fleury, east of the Meuse, the French expelled the Germans from part of the ground which had been captured according to the French official statement of yesterday. Yesterday’s British accounts state that their troops North of the Somme River had pressed forward their lines again, storming 100 yards of German trenches near Bazentain-Le Petit, and beating back six strong German attacks that marked a great battle around the village of Pozieres. The Russian advance through Galicia seems temporarily to have been checked by the counter thrusts of the Austro-German troops. It is reported that German troops have been shifted in an en­ deavor to hold Trieste, which is so closely threatened by the Italians. On the other hand, the lull in the Italian operations against Trieste is unofficially explained from Rome as due to General Cardona’s desire to straighten his lines before proceeding with a general offensive against the great Austrian sea­ port. Austrian seaplanes again have raided Venice, but, according to dispatches from Rome, only small damage resulted. Within the last few days the Russian statements have been confined to brief reports that nothing of importance has occurred. The Austrian and German War offices have been equally uncommunicative. The only fighting men­ tioned by Vienna recently was a claim of the repulse of Russian attacks on the line of Gen. von Boehm-Ermolli, who is in command of the German forces retiring from the Tarnopol front. The Allied forces on the Saloniki front have captured the rail­ road station at Doirin and four villages at other points in the front. This statement covers continu­ ous fighting from August 1 to date. The French War Office reports that the Bulgarians are being engaged along practically 100 miles of the SerbianGreek frontier. General Nicholas V. Ruzsky has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the North­ ern armies in Russia. This General was in command of the Northern Russian army at the outbreak of the war and is credited with a series of brilliant operations which culminated in the capture of Lem­ berg. The Russians report that they captured Jablonitza, one of the principal gateways from Galicia to the Hungarian plains. The Boy Scouts of Italy are to have their share in the war, the War Ministry having called out all the boys belonging to the organization for service until the opening of the schools in October. The scouts are to be divided into two classes. The class over 15 years of age will do duty in the war zone as guards at railway stations and depots. The class under 15 will be enrolled in the territorial service. They will be stationed at hospitals, mobilization centres, munition factories, aeroplane stations and hangars. An advance of a wide encircling movement by the British and Belgian forces in German East Africa is reported in an official statement issued by the British War Office this week. On Monday last the British Treasury announced a further expansion of the deposit part of its mobiliza­ tion scheme. The new plan embraces seventy highgrade foreign bonds including among others those of the Argentine, Brazilian, Chilean, Danish, Dutch, Egyptian, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish and Swiss Governments and also including a number of Argen­ tine and Canadian railway bonds, Swiss national railway bonds and Copenhagen, Stockholm and various other municipal securities. In addition to extending the list of depositable securities, the Treas­ ury modified the terms of deposit, making the period of the loan of securities to the Government five years instead of two, as has been the case with dollar securities. The Treasury still retains the option of returning the bonds to their owners after two years. Depositors will receive as commission or rental }/2 of 1% interest above the income that the securities themselves pay If the Government sells the de­ positor’s securities it will continue to pay their interest as if unsold and will return securities of the same class at the end of the deposit period. Failing to return the actual securities or the equiva­ lent, the Government reserves the right to pay the deposit value plus 5% of value and accrued interest. As affecting dollar securities, the plan provides that old depositors shall have the right to transfer from the two into the five year period, and become subject to the new conditions of sale. The old plan for American stocks and bonds, it will be recalled, provided that if securities were sold the Government should pay cash immediately, but the depositor could himself redeem them by depositing the equiva­ lent value in dollars in New York. How great has been the public response to the new plan has not been indicated by the cables. That it has been enthusiastic there can be no question, since the time has been considered propitious for announ­ cing formally the $250,000,000 British loan in New York to which we referred in last week’s issue. Securities that are to be accumulated under the new deposit plan are to constitute a major part of the collateral for this new loan. It is estimated, quoting press accounts from London, that the British holdings of the bonds contained in the new list aggregate about £600,000,000— in other words, the remarkable sum of $3,000,000,000. It is not considered likely that anything like this entire amount of securities will be promptly deposited. The Government itself does not need the full amount, for, being mere bor­ rowings, the bonds have a use that is limited to a basis of collateral. When the plan to mobilize dollar securities was originally announced, the Treas­ ury at first depended upon voluntary deposits. When these began to fall off it turned the screws, finally forcing virtually a complete deposit of all dollar securities held in Great Britain by imposing a supertax equivalent to 10% on all incomes derived from the stocks and bonds in question. Undoubtedly this same procedure will be made to apply to the bonds of neutral countries that are now for the first time being accumulated. The incident is significant of a substantial series of applications for American funds that are in sight. Until the offering of the French loan a few weeks ago American investors had had little to do in a practical way with foreign bonds or other foreign securities. While the present movement does not provide for actual investment, nevertheless it seems not unreasonable to suppose that the mere acceptance as collateral of such se­ curities on a scale like the present will mean the opening up of a new era for American capital in world affairs. Should a supertax of 10% be imposed on incomes derived from the new classes of securities which we have enumerated it will be appreciated readily how prompt would be the response of British holders to lend their property to their Government and receive the extra one-half per cent interest for their pains. We present in another column of this issue of “ The Chronicle” the complete details of the new $250,­ 000,000 loan which is an obligation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The under­ writing, we learn, has been well oversubscribed. The public offering, which will be at 99 in the form of two-year 5% notes, will be made next week if current plans are carried out; the notes to bear date of Sept. 1. Thus the issue is on a 5Yi% income basis. All the collateral which, under the plan, is to be deposited with a New York trust company, has not yet reached New York. Pending its full arrival, the British Treasury reserves the right to deposit substitute bonds subject to the approval of J. P. Morgan & Co. or to deposit gold. The latter feature, i. e., the temporary deposit of gold, seems to explain the remarkable phenomenon of the con­ tinued importations of the precious metal at a time when the proceeds of such a large loan are so closely in view. This week’s importations have reached $15,000,000. In view of the obvious relation be­ tween the modified mobilization plan of the English Treasury and the new loan which has just been nego­ tiated in New York, it will be of interest to present the following summary of the various classes of securities that will constitute the $300,000,000 col­ lateral for the $250,000,000 loan, which provides, it will be seen, a 20% margin, that the English officials guarantee shall be kept good. news that had become available. Prices of the newly mobilized stocks themselves advanced fractionally on the assumption that the plan served the double purpose of reducing the floating supplies and at the same time increasing the income values of the bonds. As had been arranged, the official London Stock Exchange list on Monday resumed the publication of double quotations, only a small percentage of listed securities remaining unquoted. Speculation on the Exchange did not, however, assume important proportions and toward the close of the week some degree of disappointment was evident as a result of the failure of the issue of £2,500,000 of New South Wales Government bonds. In this particular in­ stance the underwriters were themselves compelled to shoulder 80% of the entire offering. Shipping shares continued an outstanding feature on the London Stock Exchange. Rumors have been cur­ rent of various important consolidations of shipping companies, and there at last appears to be definite basis for the statement that the control of the Prince Line has been secured by Furness, Withy & Co. through the purchase of the holdings of managing Director Knotts. The British revenue returns indi­ cate that £21,000,000 was raised last week by short­ term borrowing. Financial sentiment in London has been aided by the splendid weather of the past month which has provided a hay crop of record volume. Despite the labor shortage, British agri­ culture this year promises well. There were dis­ tributed this week by British railways £3,520,000 in dividends. The expenditures of the United King­ dom last week amounted to £23,098,000 and the revenue was £6,605,000. The amount of Treasury bills outstanding was decreased as a net result of the week’s operations by £15,233,000. Sales of Ex­ chequer bonds were only £641,000. There is active agitation among British railway employees for higher wages. Thus far there appears slight probability that labor troubles on a substantial scale will develop. India Council bills were allotted in London on Wednes­ day at Is. 4 3-32d. The Paris Bourse was closed on Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, the last named being Assumption Day. The holiday influence continued throughout the entire week, though quotations as a rule appear to have been well maintained especially for Russian securities and French industrials. Advices cabled from the French centre intimate that a new public loan is to be offered in the near future. Figures that are official show that the war bill of France up to tho end of July has been 39,000,000,000 francs ($7,800,000,000) and the miscellaneous expenses of the Government were 10,000,000,000 francs. The war cost is now averaging 1,987,000,000 francs monthly. The French wine output of 1916 is esti­ mated by the Moniteur Viticole as 900,000,000 gallons, or double that of 1915 and 40,000,000 gallons more than in 1913. The French tax returns for the Group 1.

Investors will have the choice between a 5% long-term bond similar to that issued for the fourth loan, and a new type of security which will have a shorter maturity and lower rate. Advices cabled from Berlin state that agitation is active against the unwieldy volume of paper in circulation in the form of Government notes, the total of which has recently passed the seven-billion mark point. A campaign is being car­ ried on by a number of German newspapers for the purpose of bringing into general use throughout Germany the American system of payment by check. Business on the Berlin Bourse is said to be at a com­ plete standstill. Official bank rates at the leading European centres remain at 5 % in Paris, Vienna and Copenhagen; 5J^% in Italy, Sweden and Portugal; 6 % in London and Petrograd and 4 in Switzerland, Holland, Spain and Norway. In London the private bank rate is still quoted at 5 ^ @ 5 ^ % for sixty and ninety day bills. Cables from Berlin continue to quote 4 % % as the private bank rate at that centre. No reports have been received by cable of open market rates at other European centres, as far as we have been able to discover. Money on call in London has continued at 4 % % . The discount rate of the Bank of Bombay was announced as 5% yesterday. The Bank of England in its weekly statement reported a further gain in its gold item of £862,964. Note circulation was decreased £441,000; hence the total reserve showed a gain of £1,304,000, while the proportion of reserve to liabilities advanced to 27.11% , against 27.05% a week ago and 23.59 last year. Public deposits this week decreased £403,000, although other deposits registered an increase of £4,872,000. Government securities continued with­ out change. Loans (other securities) were expanded £3,169,000. The Bank’s gold holdings now stand at £57,413,761, against £67,125,702 a year ago and £37,959,849 in 1914. Reserves aggregate £40,157,­ 000, which compares with £53,617,867 in 1915 and £19,222,354 the year preceding. Loans total £83,­ 811,000. At the corresponding date last year they amounted to £146,183,559 and in 1914 £94,726,086. The Bank reports as of Aug. 12 the amount of cur­ rency notes outstanding as £118,696,767, against £117,844,408 last week. The amount of gold held for the redemption of such notes remains at £28,500,­ 000. Our special correspondent is no longer able to give the details of the gold movement into and out of the Bank for the Bank week, inasmuch as the Bank has discontinued reporting the details.

The silver item registered a nominal increase— 30,000 francs. Note circulation, however, in contrast with the enormous increase of the week preceding, showed a decrease of 13,501,000 francs. General deposits were expanded 363,000 francs, bills discounted in­ creased 11,917,000 francs and Treasury deposits were 4,303,000 francs higher, while the Bank’s ad­ vances declined 3,471,000 francs. The Bank’s hold­ ings of gold aggregate 4,802,141,000 francs (including the balance held abroad, which, according to latest advices, amounted to 271,055,668 francs), as com­ pared with 4,392,361,472 francs in 1915 and 4,141,­ 350,000 francs the year previous. Silver on hand now stands at 338,491,000 francs, against 367,914,­ 129 francs a year ago and 625,325,000 francs in 1914. Note circulation is 16,316,421,000 francs. Last year it totaled 12,899,360,950 francs and in 1914 6.683.175.000 francs. General deposits amount to 2.129.718.000 francs, compared with 2,462,571,360 francs in 1915 and 947,575,000 francs in 1914. Bills discounted total 439,126,000 francs against 277,964,­ 875 francs a year ago. Advances aggregate 1,183,­ 309,000 francs, compared with 589,099,103 francs in 1915. In 1914 bills discounted and advances to­ gether totaled 3,202,975,000 francs. Treasury de­ posits are 141,807,000 francs. At this date last year the amount was 111,302,588 francs and in 1914 382.575.000 francs. The figures here given for 1914 are those for the week ending July 30, the Bank hav­ ing discontinued the publication of weekly returns in 1914 with the outbreak of the war. The weekly statement of the Imperial Bank of Germany, as of August 15, shows the following changes: Total coin and bullion increased 494,000 marks; gold increased 439,000 marks; Treasury notes decreased 6,001,000 marks, notes of other banks increased 2,248,000 marks. Bills discounted increased 194,014,000 marks, advances decreased 6,000 marks. Investments increased 12,925,000 marks, other securities increased 19,245,000 marks, notes in circulation decreased 54,574,000 marks. Deposits were expanded 231,725,000 marks and other liabilities increased 45,768,000 marks. Total gold holdings were 2,468,392,000 marks on Aug. 15, against 2,404,373,000 marks in 1915 and 1,508,525,­ 000 marks the previous year. Note circulation totaled 6,926,107,000 marks, compared with 5,388,­ 773,000 marks a year ago and 3,881,931,000 marks in 1914. If anything the local money situation has given evidence of even greater ease for the earlier maturi­ ties, though for loans extending into the new year a rather more independent attitude is displayed by the banks and other lenders. Several important trans­ actions were made on the basis of January and Febru­ ary at 4 % with the collateral consisting of all in­ dustrial securities. But on regular mixed collateral a fair business in the same maturities has been re­ ported at 3 % % . The continued importation of gold is one of the chief influences of the unseasonably easy conditions. Crop requirements have now about reached their peak and trade and industrial activity in all sections of the country is continuing on an epoch-marking scale. With a French loan of $100,­ 000,000 negotiated but a short time ago, and with an English issue of $250,000,000 to be offered next week, the free offering of loanable funds is little short of remarkable. How far British Treasury operations are responsible for this concededly ab­ normal position, it is difficult to say. There is no question, however, that it is an influence of some R E D IS C O U N T R A T E S OF F E D E R A L R E S E R V E H AN K S. 1 t o 3 0 (l a y s m a t u r i t y ........... “ “ ______ ........... “ “ 31 t o 6 0 61 t o 9 0 3 3 3 t o 3 0 d a y s m a t u r i t y ........... to 60 “ “ ........... ______ to 90 “ “ d a y s t o 6 m o n t h s m a t u r it y O PEN 4 4 4 4 4 ■04 5 3A 3A 314 3A 3A 3A 3A _ _ _ 3 A 3A 3A 3A 3A 3 A _ 4A 4A 4 4A 4 4 A 4A 4 5 5 _ _ _ _ 4A 4 4A 4 4 A 3A 3 A 3 3A 3 A A 3A 3 A 3A 3 A 3 A A 3A 3A 4 3A 3 A . . .

We have explained in recent issues of “ The Chronicle’’ the necessity, from the British Treasury's standpoint, of maintaining an easier range of money rates in New York than in London. Any advance here must be promptly followed at the British centre; otherwise the sterling exchange situa­ tion would at once become disorganized. Further­ more, should rates in London, in order to protect the sterling situation, be raised,it would at once im­ pose a severe handicap upon the entire fabric of British war finance. Hence it does not appear unreasonable to believe that representatives of the British Treasury will use their best endeavors to maintain the American money situation upon a com­ fortable basis. In last Saturday’s statement of New York Clearing House members, which will be found in greater detail on a subsequent page of this issue, loans showed an increase of $23,241,000 and net demand deposits were expanded $36,948,000, although net time de­ posits decreased $19,074,000. Reserves in “ own vaults” increased $2,594,000 to $437,159,000, of which $369,599,000 is specie. At this date last year the total in own vaults was $475,096,000, in­ cluding $399,140,000 in specie. Reserves in Federal Reserve banks were decreased $7,772,000 to $155,­ 789,000, as compared with $131,227,000 a year ago. Reserves in other depositories increased $2,141,000 to $52,655,000, against $29,346,000 in 1915. Note circulation registered a nominal increase— $97,000. Aggregate reserves, for the first time in several weeks, reported a reduction of $3,037,000 to $645,­ 603,000, which compares with $635,669,000 at the corresponding date the year preceding. Reserve requirements were increased $6,187,640, and coinci­ dent with this increase the surplus reserve showed the somewhat heavy loss of $9,224,640, which carried the total of excess reserves down to $103,087,140, comparing with $187,232,860 in 1915. Referring specifically to rates for money, call loans again ranged at 2@ 2 J 4 % . Monday 2 % % was the minimum and 2 % % the high and renewal basis. On Tuesday 2 % % continued to be the maximum and renewal quotation, with the low 2 % . Wednesday the range was 2 % @ 2 % % and 2 % % still the ruling figure. On Thursday the low was 234%> which was also the basis for renewals, while 2 % % was high. Friday 2@ 23^% constituted the range, while renewals remained at 2 % % . In time money the tone re­ mains easy, with quotations unchanged from those current the week previous. Sixty days continued at 2 % @ 3 % , ninety days at 3 @ 3 % % , four months at 334@ '3% % , five months at 3 }/2 @ 3 % % and six months at 3 3 ^ @ 3 ^ % (against 3% a week ago). Last year sixty-day money ruled at 2 % % , ninety days at 2 % % , four months at 2 % % , five months at 3 @ 3 % % and six months at 3(6)3%%. Mercantile paper rates were not changed from 3 % % for sixty and ninety days’ endorsed bills receivable and six months’ names of choice character, while names not so well known still require 4 @ 4 % % .

With the announcement that arrangements had been completed for the loan to the United Kingdom of $250,000,000, it was not unnatural that the sterling exchanges should respond with a display of considerable firmness. The improved tone was not accompanied, however, by any important increase in the volume of business. The entire market, indeed, may be still regarded as occupying an arbi­ trary position. Exports are continuing on a thoroughly active scale. Imports, too, are active, but, as we have noted, business is not being con­ ducted on the basis of the supply and demand for exchange at the present time. Gold to the amount of $15,000,000 has been imported from Ottawa and $10,000,000 from London during the week, which, as we have suggested in a preceding paragraph, is a somewhat mystifying performance, in view of the important amount of funds that will be avail­ able in New York to the British Treasury before September 1 from the proceeds of the new loan. The suggestion certainly obtrudes, however, that this inbound gold movement has direct association with the desire of the British authorities that the money situation in New York shall not assume a much higher basis. Gold export engagements from New York this week have comprised $325,000 to Spain and $200,000 to Cuba. Compared with Friday of last week, sterling ex­ change on Saturday was not quotably changed from 4 75 11-16 for demand, 4 76 7-16 for cable transfers and 4 713^ for sixty days. On Monday the arrival of another shipment of gold failed to arouse activity, although it served as a steadying influence; demand remained at 4 75 11-16, cable transfers at 4 76 7-16 and sixty days at 4 713^2 • Additional imports of the precious metal induced a firmer tone on Tuesday and demand bills advanced to 4 75% ; cable transfers and sixty days, however, were not changed from ----------------Spot Delivery------------------Delivery 4 76 7-16 and 4 71% , respectively.

The Continental exchanges have evinced little activity, no new feature worthy of note having trans­ pired during the week. German exchang3 was firm at the opening, but later eased off, apparently as a result of the withdrawal of banking support. Francs, which have ruled somewhat easier for the past few days, exhibited a firmer tendency towards the close. Both lire and rubles were without essential change, and the volume of business passing has been small. Demand bills on Berlin closed at 72% and cables at 72% , against 72 13-16 and 72 15-16 last week. Kronen, on the other hand, were relatively steady and finished fractionally higher at 12.40, compared with 12.35 the week previous. The sterling check rate on Paris closed at 28.14% , against 28.17 Friday last. In New York sight bills on the French centre finished at 5 90% and cables at 5 90, which com­ pares with 5 91% and 5 91% the previous close. Lire closed at 6 48 for bankers’ sight and 6 47% for cables A week ago the close was 6 47% and 6 46% , respectively. Rubles finished at 30.60, against 30.40 last week. In the neutral exchanges dulness was also strongly in evidence. Fluctuations were narrow and unim­ portant, with the trend towards higher levels, so far as the Scandinavian rates were concerned, though with some reaction later. Guilders ruled weaker. Bankers’ sight on Amsterdam finished at 41% plus 1-16, against 41 5-16 plus 1-16; cables at .41% minus 1-16, against 41 7-16 minus 1-16; com­ mercial sight at 41 3-16 (unchanged), and com­ mercial sixty days at 41% (unchanged). Swiss ex­ change closed at 5 29% for bankers’ sight and 5 28% for cables, against 5 29% and 5 28% the week pre­ ceding. Greek exchange remains at 5 17%. Copen­ hagen checks finished at 28.50, compared with 28.55. Checks on Norway closed at 28.65, against 28.70, and checks on Sweden finished at 28.65, against 28.75 at the close on last Friday. Spanish pesetas closed at 20.15, comparing with 20.18 a week ago. The New York Clearing House banks, in their operations Avitli interior banking institutions, have gained 83,046,000 net in cash as a result of the currency movements for the week end­ ing Aug. 18. Their receipts from the interior have aggregated 89,071,000, while the ship­ ments have reached 86,025,000. Adding the Sub­ Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank operations and the gold imports, which together occasioned a gain of 88,714,000, the combined result of the flow of money into and out of the New York banks for the week appears to have been a gain of $11,­ 760,000, as follows: T o t. w eek.

THE NEXT CHAPTER IN WAR. THE EUROPEAN It has long'been recognized that, with the Russian army’s advance at the^end of June, simultaneously with the beginning of the powerful attack of the English and French armies on Germany’s western front, the history of the European war passed into a new chapter. It was the fourth distinct chapter of the great conflict— the first being Germany’s invasion of Belgium and France and the advance to the Marne; the second, the prolonged trench fighting which followed the retreat to the Aisne; the third, with which the second year of war began, being the retreat of Russia’s army and the invasion of Serbia by the Teutonic forces and the Bulgarians. The prolonged and futile attack by the Crown Prince on Verdun appears now, in retrospect, merely as an episode in the period of transition from the German and Austrian general offensive of the last half of 1915 to the present forward movement of the Allies. The time seems now to have arrived when the ques­ tion, what the next chapter in the history of the war, is to be, will have peculiar and immediate in­ terest. The forward movement on both fronts has now lasted nearly two months. It has been marked, at least on the Eastern and Southern fronts, by ad­ vances in their way as important as the Teutonic advance in the East and Southeast a year ago. Yet it still remains a matter of great difficulty to deter­ mine to what extent the probable outcome of the war, not to mention the probable date of its ending, is indicated by the recent course of events. The strategy of the Allies has been simple. Based as it was on a simultaneous attack on all the Teutonic fronts, by armies equipped with immense stores of artillery, it was calculated, and thus far apparently with reason, that such unremitting pressure on all sides at once would distinctly put an end to the familiar manoeuvre of the Teutonic armies during previous Allied offensives; namely— the rapid transfer of troops from one front, where the enemy’s activity had slackened, to another front where the fightipg was more severe, or where (as in Serbia) opportuni­ ties for rapid achievement had opened. The long delay in this simultaneous Allied offensive was, obvi­ ously, due to the wish to accumulate an overpowering supply of ammunition on all the Allied fronts at once. Apparently the violent German attack at Verdun played into the hands of the Allies through using up the German reserve of ammunition while the English and Russians were completing their own arrangements. The correctness of these calculations has been shown, first, by the collapse of Austria in the face of the Russian advance— Germany being held too firmly in the West to spare re-enforcements such as turned the tide of Russian victory a year ago— and second, by the advance of the Italian army, and its capture of the important position of Gorizia, as soon as Austria was compelled to withdraw troops from the Italian front to re-enforce her retreating armies in Galicia. Summing up what has happened since the general offensive of the Allies began in the middle of this year, the salient fact is that the Teutonic Powers have, for the first time, been placed distinctly on the defensive and in a position, gener­ ally speaking, of disadvantage. Austria’s resisting power has beyond question been impaired very gravely by the sacrifice of strategic positions, and even more by her enormous loss in prisoners. This result has been important, not alone in weakening the total defensive power of the Teutonic Allies, but in its moral effect on Balkan States such as Rumania and Greece. What will be the end of the present spectacular Russo-Austrian campaign it is not altogether easy to conjecture; especially since the strategy of the Russian commanders has thus far directed itself, not (as in the 1915 campaign) to invasion of Hungarian territory, but to destruc­ tion of Austria’s fighting power. On the Western front the French and English armies have, indeed, gained ground, breaking through to the second and even third line of German defenses. Yet, even so, the advances have still been measured by yards rather than miles, and, with the long period of preparation which the German Staff has had tor constructing additional trenches and lines of battle behind the immediate front, it remains as obvious as before that the task of driving the Germany army out of Belgium and France must be a matter of many months— even supposing uninterrupted super­ iority of the Allies in men and munitions. Much the same may be said of the Italian advance which has only reached the second line of Austrian defenses. It is naturally impossible to say whether the actual result to date in both these directions has or has not been disappointing on the whole to the Allied commanders; but the course of events, how­ ever encouraging in itself, has given no ground for predicting early termination of the war. Indeed, there has been less talk of peace negotiations, whether at London or at Paris or at Berlin, than there was a year ago. Germany herself, whose statesmen toward the end of 1915 were apparently anxiously circulating tentative proposals of peace through every available channel, has now adopted the attitude of sullen and irreconcilable reserve. The world has even learned of an angry political attack at home on the German Chancellor for his previous intimations of willingness for peace. Mean­ time, among Germany’s antagonists, the outstanding tendency of the day seems to be increasing violence of angry feeling among both public men and the people at large. The economic conference at Paris, with its remarkable intimations as to a trade war after return of peace, has been perhaps the most striking illustration of the public temper. It has found even more curious expression in this week’s actual intima­ tion by the English Premier that resumption of diplo­ matic relations with Germany even after the^war might be refused by England until the German people or Government had atoned for such public outrages as the putting to death of Captain Fryatt for resist­ ing a German submarine. Are we then reduced to the conclusion that two or three years more of fighting are inevitable, before terms of peace can be definitely agreed on? The question cannot be satisfactorily answered through the familiar argument of “ attrition,” in human re­ serves or in economic resources. The war has already taught us how easy it is to be deceived as to the stay­ ing powrer of a great State in such directions. The one important possibility which seems to stand out on the horizon is the case of Austria. As yet, there has been no sign that the reserves of the Allies in men and munitions are approaching such depletion as would arrest their initiative, and thus far there has been little sign of concerted activity on another very vital part of the Teutonic front, the armies of Saloniki. Purely as a military hypothesis, it might be supposed that the Allies are now preparing for a pow­ erful offensive from that direction, which, if success­ ful, and if timed to coincide with simultaneous ad­ vances by the Russian'and Italian armies on the other Austrian fronts, would have results of the highest importance. Conceivably, such a demonstration might force a separate peace on the Vienna Govern­ ment. It might at least eliminate Austria and Bul­ garia entirely as factors in future campaigns, and might consequently threaten Germany through Austria’s own territory. This is only one of the numerous conditional pos­ sibilities. Events of that sort develop very slowly in present-day warfare, and all prediction must, moreover, be qualified by the world’s existing ignor­ ance as to actual conditions behind the line of battle. Nothing, for that matter, has been really more com­ plete than our lack of knowledge regarding the actual attitude of the German and Austrian people regarding the war. It cannot be safely inferred that such out­ bursts as those of Maximilian Harden necessarily in­ dicate a general stirring of unrest and discontent among the German people; yet such a thing is possi­ ble. In England and France, concerning which our information is far better, popular determination to fight the war to a finish is reasonably certain. Is it the same with the Teutonic people? If so, then the war will certainly go on until some complete and sweeping success, perhaps at a distant date, enables the victors to dictate terms. If not, we may yet witness a gradual disintegration in morale and fight­ ing power, such as hampered and eventually wrecked the plans of Napoleon when the French people them­ selves, after 1812, turned against his ambitious schemes. THE MENACE IN THE DEMANDS OF RAILWAY LABOR. In considering the clinch nominally between the railway managers and four railway brotherhoods, which has been carried to [the White House, as though that could alter it, two propositions stand out boldly and ought to be emphasized effectually. The first is that this is the situation which any thoughtful man should have foreseen long ago, because all the handling of this perennial quarrel has been tending straight towards it. For approximately ten years, in a succession almost as regular as the return of the seasons, railway employees have been coming for­ ward with demands, on penalty of strike, organized labor having shrewdly picked an indispensable public service as its best field of exploitation, because there they could threaten inconvenience to the largest number of a people who seem to dread inconvenience above all else. Always more has been demanded than was ex­ pected; always a professed arbitration has listened to one side, has given no real heed to the other, and has granted the men something; always they have taken that something (without thanks) and have used it as the starting-stage for the next recurrent demand; always the different sets of men have politely taken their turns, and not in a single instance has there been any recession. To hold fast all ex­ torted, and stand upon it for the next demand, has been the method. Nothing has been placated, nothing been settled; merely procrastination, a truce weakly obtained for to-day, with a firm stand ever growing harder to bring to the point of determina­ tion. This is a species of blackmail; yielding always emboldens the blackmailer and weakens the victim. Naturally these men have grown in daring. Some years ago one of their leaders said that receivers’ cash is as good as any, and now their cynical selfish­ ness has gone to the limit. They will have what they demand and nothing less, with no more arbitra­ tion, or they will put the country practically in the condition of a beleaguered town. They talk as if in a state of war and addressing an enemy; what may happen to him is his concern, not theirs; they ignore all other railway employees than their frac­ tion, and pose as if forgetting that they themselves would be in the common suffering; they make a threat whose import will not be fully realized until the country has had the instructive lesson of a few days stoppage of transportation. The case is brought to M r. Wilson that he may do what previous arbitrators have done: make the managers yield enough to satisfy the men until the next recurrent demand. As for trying the eighthour day, which is the ostensible goal of strife now, and afterwards discovering whether it is feasible, this would be leaping first and looking gftenvards, and no sane mind can imagine the men would sur­ render it after once getting it; it will be as final as once giving women the vote. As for the easyminded persons who perceive that the trend of all this is towards governmental operation or owner­ ship, they should understand that the chronic dis­ turbance is not thus to be settled; then the employees would have the politicians to deal with directly, and would understand that they had only to ask and it should be given. The second proposition brought out is that the position of the Government in this reference to M r. Wilson is at once feeble and unmoral. He is not an arbitrator agreed upon between two contestants, but the official head of the entire country, and these union leaders dare to tell him that they will paralyze the country unless he makes the railway managers grant their demand. Does this reception of such a demand show authority, such as belongs to “ the strong government” we sometimes appear to be get­ ting and some persons think desirable, or is it weak­ ness and yielding to political fear? The alternative and threat are distinctly hostile. W hat if he told these men that if they dared send out their threatened order they would quickly be dealt with as public enemies? This power is like dynamite (arrogantly boasted one of them) and it is not pleasant to be carrying dynamite in one’s pocket, therefore “ we” will not wait long; suppose he were taken at his figure and treated as a dynamiter ? “ Treason against the United States” says an ancient document “ shall consist only in levying war against them, or in ad­ hering to their enemies, giving them aid and com­ fort.” Possibly we need an enlargement of the definition; but if this seems to any reader an exag­ gerated treatment of the subject let him stress his imagination to conceive what a real suspension of transportation would be, and then decide whether an “ order” to trainmen to collectively cease their public service is not very much like levying war upon the United States. Or, put this view by and observe that instead of speaking as the country and with its power in his words and telling these threat­ ened to beware how they order the start of a public calamity the President pleads with them to be reconciled — that is, urges the roads to yield to anything to satisfy the threateners for the present. Let us be rational but also unafraid in speaking of this subject. These complainants are in nowise oppressed; they have no substantial grievance; having heretofore played upon public sympathy and public fear together they now put their stress mainly on the latter. The treatment of the subject of transportation by our Government has been feeble, shifty, and evasive for some years. Sometimes the “ arbitrators” in this perpetual wage demand have pleaded inability to determine whether the roads could afford any increase of wage; sometimes they have dismissed the railroad side as not their affair; and sometimes they have suggested that the roads could apply for leave to recoup themselves by an increase in rates. The Inter-State Commerce Commission has stood unfriendly, holding the vise-grip on the roads in­ come (and even at this hour some shippers are com­ plaining of rates) while recurrent demands on rail­ road expense account were permitted. There is a wasteful “ physical valuation” slowly dragging on, in deference to a persistent notion that possibly the roads are charging for returns on over-capitalization; there is also a new investigation of the “ whole sub­ ject” of land-carriage ordered, as just another piece of putting off a troublesome problem. Business is investigated, accused, beset by commissions, regu­ lated; but Congress has not undertaken anything on behalf of the large business of transportation except to further burden it. There is a steady stream of bills, as if everything for the public welfare was to be legislated into the record before this year’s compaign ends; what has Congress done to really and justly and practicably reach a modus vivendi for capital and labor? Are we not, to-day, just where we have been: parleying, temporizing, yielding little by little, putting the trouble along to some indefinite future? Congress has been busy in regulating, limiting, or suppressing combination and monopoly; what has it done about labor combination and monopoly except to tag riders on its behalf to appropriation and other bills? The key to this maltreatment of a problem which will never be solved until grappled with is one un­ pleasant word: cowardice. Men in office want to come back and cannot rise to the plane of doing right and disregarding their own political future. THE CHILD LABOR BILL— SEEKING GOOD ENDS BY BAD M E A N S . More than three years ago suggestions were put out that the products of child labor might be barred from carriage across a State line, and now a bill of that character has been pushed through Congress. Any injurious working of children is not only im­ moral but economically destructive, as contrary to nature as an attempt to thrive by drinking one’s own blood. If the qualifying adjective is retained, not a word can be said against the professed object of sav­ ing the children. The humanitarian appeal is cred­ itable to sympathy while not so to judgment. The insistence upon this piece of “ social betterment” legis­ lation by M r. Wilson and his party, and the shrinking by the Republicans from going on record against it, are intelligible in a Presidential year; yet the bill is discriminating in its application and is also another example of seeking good ends by bad means. The history of the times proves that the intent of the commerce clause of the Constitution was negative rather than positive, a restraint upon State interfer­ ences with the transit of goods; it could not well have been expressed in other or less general terms, yet nothing was farther from the dreams of any man of that day than that this prohibition of hindrances by States would ever be pushed to a complete control of industry by Congress. Professor Woodrow W il­ son, some years ago, referring particularly to this very proposition, said in his work on “ Constitutional Gov­ ernment” that “ if the power to regulate commerce between the States can be stretched to include the regulation of labor in mills and factories it can be made to embrace every particular of the industrial organization of the country.” This has recently been quoted against him, and it is unavailing for a de­ fender to say (as one such has done) that men change with circumstances and M r. Wilson has changed by becoming wholly and consistently Progressive, of which he has given the country plain notice. The quoted remark is literally true and clearly stated; unless the drift to regulate everything by further pulling of that clause to cover it is soon halted, there is literally no conceivable limit to what may be attempted under it. The Senate bill would ban all products as well as the tainted ones from any quarry, mill or workshop which persists in using child labor; the carrying of war munitions might be forbidden; as one Senator suggested, persons might be barred from going to a “ divorce” State, and the children subsequently born to divorcees might be forbidden to travel across a State line; further, illegitimate per­ sons might be forbidden to travel; newspapers op­ posing the dominant party or those disapproved by the public censor might be forbidden carriage across a State line or be forbidden the mails outright. It does not matter that some supposititious case may be deemed inconceivably absurd; what is such in one generation has been, as we know, advocated and taken up by another, and it is literally true (as Professor Wilson said) that “ the only limitations Congress would observe, should the Supreme Court assent to such obviously absurd extravagances of in­ terpretation (of the commerce clause), would be the limitation of opinion and circumstances.” Can the Supreme Court be expected to say that a particular stretch of the over-stretched clause is too much for allowance, after allowing previous stretches under the general legal doctrine that Con­ gress must be its own judge of how far it will go under a general power? Hardly. It is now only three years since the Court unanimously, and on exactly that ground, affirmed the “ rider” which practically excluded all publications from the mails unless they printed certain useless private information concern­ ing themselves, doing this on the argument that Congress may “ classify,” and there is really no limit to classification. Obviously, there is none; so, as a preliminary to the formal setting up of a public cen­ sorship, there might be a rider barring from secondclass rates all publications which do not consent to review and editing by a sort of unofficial censor. More than three years ago an initiatory petition was started in Ohio for a law to declare newspapers there public utilities, so as to bring them under “ regulation.” There is no final barrier whatever to meddling in the interest of morals and the general welfare; what Professor Wilson called “ the limitation of opinion and circumstances” is really none. As for Senator Tillman’s prediction that ultimately there will be a law closing inter-State carriage to anything objected to by labor unions, this cannot be called an impossible descent of our politics, in view of the de­ scent already accomplished in truckling to organized labor. The children must be saved from destructive labor, certainly, but this good end is not limited to bad means. The consequences of a prolonged subsidence of State sovereignty, permitted by slothfulncss in part and more by the eagerness to snatch largess from the common fund gathered by taxation, arc very far-reaching and insidiously bad; the longer this course proceeds the more difficult to check it. The welfare of children, as one phase of the public welfare, is properly a matter for each State. Is it said that some States are too vicious or too negligent to be trusted ? The saving power of all statutes vests in the public opinion behind it; effort to uplift the people by imposing on them statutes in advance of them are as naturally futile as the New Year good resolutions which the individual has not the strength to keep; the lack is in himself, and resolving does not help him . Far better to bear the social evils we have until public opinion can be brought to attacking them lo­ cally, than to go on pulling the framework of our Government, already subjected to unavoidable stresses upon subjects which are not local, further out of co-ordination as intended by our wise though not infallible fathers. PIG IRON PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES THE FIRST HALF OF 1916. The official statistics of pig iron production in the United States for the first half of the current calendar year have been made public the present week by the American Iron and Steel Institute, and show results about as expected. The make of iron for the six months is found to have fallen but little short of 20,000,000 tons, the exact amount of the output having been 19,619,522 tons. This compares with 17,682,422 tons in the second half of 1915 and only 12,233,791 tons in the first half of 1915, and no more than 10,796,150 tons in the second half of 1914 and 12,536,094 tons in the first half of 1914. The American Iron and Steel Institute does not furnish the record of production by months, but from compilations by the “ Iron Age” of this city and the “ Iron Trade Review’7 of Cleveland, it ap­ is no river, but the gateway to one vastly important pears that the production ran above 3,000,000 tons water approach to this port; the Hudson itself is in each and every month.
