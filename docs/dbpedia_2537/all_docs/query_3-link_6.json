Origin of the Code. — The International Code of Signals was prepared by a Committee* appointed by the British Board of Trade, on the 2d Jnly, 1855, \"to inquire into and report upon the subject of a Code of Signals to be used at Sea.\" The Report of this Committee, ac- companied by a prepared Signal-Code, which is that now known as the International Code, was made during September of the following year. The Report was as follows : Committee-boom, Board of Trade, Whitehall, September 24, 1856. To the Lords of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade: My Lords : In pursuance of your Lordships' Minute of the 2d July, 1855, appointing us a Committee \"to inquire into and report upon the subject of a Code of Siguals to be used at sea,\" we assembled on the 3d of that month, and have since from time to time continued our meet- ings; and, having fully considered the subject, we have the honor tc submit the following report of onr proceedings. Before euteriug upon the general question of the formation of a new Code of Signals for the Mercantile Navy, we thought it right to examine such published Codes as have from time to time been in use in the Royal Navy aud the British as well as foreign merchant services. They are comprised in the following list: L Admiralty Code 1808 2. Lynn's 1818 3. Squire's 1820 4. Admiralty 1826 5. Phillipps' 1836 6. Bolide's 1836 7. Rape^s 1828 8. Admiralty, (present Code.) 9. Walker's 1841 10. Watson's 11. Rogers' (American) 1854 12. Reynold's, (French) 1855 13. Marryatt's j J^J In addition to the above, several other Codes, more or less of a local or limited character, were noticed by us, as also various suggestions •The members of this Committee were an follows: Nominated by the Hoard of Trade— Rear- Ad m.ral Beecbey, F. K. S.; Captain Robert Fitzroy, R. N.; J. H. Brown, Esq., the Re-tinter-General of Seamen. Nominated by Admiralty— Rwar- Admiral Bethune. Nominated by Trinity llou»e— Captain H. B. Bax, II.

Digitized by Google VIII for signaling at sea that have been submitted to us, either directly or throngh the Board of Trade and other Departments of Government. After carefully examining the modes of signaling adopted in these various codes and plans, we were of opinion that, although all were in some respects unsatisfactory in themselves, as not fulfilling all the re- quirements of the present day, yet there existed in them the elements for forming an improved code for the use of ships. We had particularly to consider that, independently of a good system of signals for effecting a telegraphic communication between ships, one very important object in framing a system for the purpose was to pro- vide, at the same time, facilities for making chips' name* or numbers. The great advantage to be derived from an easy method of exchang- ing ships' names by signals is obvious. In a report which was submitted to your Lordships by the Begistrar- General of Seamen in March, 1855, your Lordships' attention is drawn to the provisions of the Merchant-Shipping Act, 1854, by which every British registered ship is compelled to have permanently marked on her main beam the number — now generally described as her \"Official Number'' — by which she is registered, which is entered upon her Certifi- cate of Registry, and by which she may be at once identified without reference to her name. These numbers will, it is calculated, amount to upward of 40,000 in the first year after registry has become general; and as the canceled numbers will not be renewed until a lapse of perhaps five years, it has been calculated that upward of 50,000 numbers will be outstanding at one time, and that, consequently, that number must be provided for in the code, in addition to the number required for telegraphic purposes. We next considered what principles should be laid down as the basis for the formation of an efficient code, and resolved as follows: L The code ought to be comprehensive and clear, and not expensive. 2. It ought to provide for not less than 20,000 distinct signals, and should, besides, be capable of designating not less than 50,000 ships, with power of extension if required. 3. It should express the nature of the signal made by the combina- tion of the signs employed, and the more important signals should be expressed by the more simple combinations. 4. A signal should not consist of more than four flags or symbols at one hoist. 5. A signal should be made complete in one hoist, in one place. 6. Signals should have the same meaning wherever shown. 7. The signal-book should be so arranged, either numerically or alpha- betically, in classes, as to admit of the subject being readily referred to, and provision should be made for future additions. 8. The code should be so framed as to be capable of adaptation for international communication. As regards the existing system of making signals at sea, we submit the following observations: The code of signals most generally used at this time on board both British and foreign ships is that known as \" Marryatt's.\" There is also a French code by Captain Reynold, of the French Imperial Navy, which has been translated into English, and an American code by Mr. Rogers, of Baltimore, in use in their respective countries, and, as we are in- formed, recognized by their respective governments. These codes are all based on the numeral system; that is to say, the flags are numbered from 1 to 9, with a cipher-flag, (0,) and the signals are composed of one or more flags, representing by numbers the words or sentences required to be indicated. Digitized by LjOOQle IX Perhaps the best argument in favor of this (the immoral) system is the fact that all the codes in use (with the exception of the vocabulary used in the Royal Navy) are based on it, and a code on any other prin- ciple would be so far at variance with existing habits; but, whatever importance is attached to that circumstance, there are other consider- ations of equal weight which must not be lost sight of, and which have influenced us in forming an opinion on the merits of the system. It is perhaps advisable briefly to submit to your Lordships the objec- tions which it appears to us exist to that method of signaling. If the number of signals required were very limited, we believe that the immoral system above referred to would be sufficient ; but since it is intended to give the official numbers of ships, and as a range of numerals of not less than 70,000 will be required, we are of opinion that that system is quite inadequate. It is obvious that to represent such numbers as 22, 131, 444, 5,656, &c, with only a single set of flags, means must be devised to substitute some sign — either a flag or a jtondant — to represent the numeral-flag already employed, and of which no duplicate is carried. This can only be accomplished with one set of flags by the use of distinct signs, called \" substitutes or repeaters,\" and which may be made to repeat the flags for which they are designed to act as substitutes ; thus, by the follow- ing, which is the simplest method : A repeats the 1st flag in the hoist. B ditto 2d ditto. C ditto 3d ditto. We think that there is great objection to the use of these repeating- flags. Great caution is necessary in placiug them, and there is always risk of making mistakes. It also involves the necessity of making one substitute repeat another substitute, which is objectionable, but unavoidable. If f urther proof were required that the. use of repeating flags is to be avoided, we would refer to the codes of Marryatt, Rogers, and Reynold, who have hitherto evaded their use by omitting in their respective codes all, or nearly all, numbers in which the saint' numeral appears more than once, such as 44, 313, 6,161, 8,888, &c; aud by dispensing with the aid of these auxiliaries they greatly lessen the capacity of their codes, as is shown thus: Ten numerals with 3 repeaters would make 9,900 signals. Ten numerals without the aid of repeaters make only.. 5, 860 \" Sliow in£ a loss of 4, 139 numbers in every 10,000 signals. Any given number may, however, be made with 10 flags and 3 re- peaters, up to 9,999; but a numeral code consisting of 13 flags (if no more than 4 flags are to be shown in one hoist, and if the signal is to be complete iu that hoist, and not divided by exhibiting a part of it in another place) must of necessity be limited to 9,999 signals. It is true that in the numeral code, by the use of distinguishing or divisional flags or peudant£, as many different series of numbers may be obtained as there are j>endants or flags employed for the purpose, and that by changing the position of these distinguishing flags the number of series may be multiplied. The plan of obtaining high numerals by both Marryatt's and Rey- nold's codes proceeds on the above principle of distinguishing pendants or flags ; that is to say, particular flags designate certain classes ot signals, such as the \"telegraph\" flag and the \"rendezvous\" flag, which Digitized by Google X signify, respectively, either that you are converging or are appointing a place of meeting ; and pendants are used for classifying ships according to the color of the pendant employed. For the purpose also of increas- ing the numeral power of the signal-book, (that is, of effecting a fresh series of signals,) the same pendant may be placed at the top or bottom or in the middle of the hoist, and its value, i. e. its numeral power, may be varied in eaeh separate position. In all these codes five flags in a hoist are used to make high numbers; and in the latest editiou of Mar ryatt's code four repeating- flags are employed for making consecutive numbers as high as 99,999. Mr. Rogers, in the present edition of his code, does not employ repeaters, but he has a scheme for so doing, in the same manner as by Marryatt's code. We fonnd other means adopted for enlarging a code of signals, namely, by the use of distinguishing pendants shown from another mast head, or by dividing the signal and showing part on one mast and part elsetvhere. We have already referred to our decision, that in any efficient code no more than four flags ought to be shown in one hoist, and that a sig- nal ought to be made in one hoist at one place. Upon these grounds, therefore, the system of numerals appeared to us to be defective for a comprehensive code, as not being capable of designating in a consecutive numerical series 70,000 distiuct signals without at any time showiug more than four flags for each signal made; and it is clear, therefore, that it would have been inconsistent with the principles laid down to have proceeded with the framing of a code upon the basis of a system of numeral signs. Having thus set aside the numeral system, we had to consider what other method would best meet the requirements of an efficient code. There was only one other method known to us by which the objects we had in view could be attaiued. It was that of taking a number of signs (or flags) sufficient for the purpose, and by their transposition effecting a certain number of per- mutations, each different combination of two or more of the signs so taken forming a signal distinct in itself and having a particular signifi- cation. We subjoin a table showing the number of distinct signals which ten or more flags are capable, by permutation, of forming in hoists of from two to four signs at a time in one place.

The actual number (18) is only two more than vessels using Marry - att's Code now carry ; and having decided upon this number, we pro- ceeded to the naming of the flags or signs, in devising which it appeared to us — L That the character should be familiar ones. 2. That they should recur in well-known order, for facility of refer- ence. The letters of the alphabet seemed best adapted for the purpose, and we determined that it would be most convenient to assign to each of the 18 flags a letter of the alphabet, leaving out the vowels. The omission of the vowels was forced upon us from the circumstance that by introducing them every objectional word composed of four let- ters or less, not only in our own but in foreign languages, would appear in the code in thecourseof the permutation of the letters of the alphabet. Too much importance should not, however, be set upon the objection which naturally occurs, that the alphabet is thus incomplete, and that the power of spelling is apparently lost ; for it should be under- stood that the letters are not used a* letters, but as signs, characterizing the different flags by the most familiar method, and in an order well known. The last consideration which occupied our attention was the coloring of the flags to be used. In determining this question, the following points were discussed : 1. Whether Marryatt's flags were the best adapted in shape and color for signaling f 2. Whether Marryatt's flags, being generally in use on board mer- chant ships of this and foreign countries, and, also, as we have found, at many foreign signal stations, it would not be convenient to adopt them as far as possible t Wo were not prepared to decide the first question in the affirmative, but considering the heavy expense of procuring a new set of flags, and in deference to what appeared to be a general wish, that flags which are, and have been for many years, so generally in use in merchant-ships, and with which mariners are familiar, should not without very strong reasons be dispensed with, wo determined to recommend the adoption of the flags now employed in Maryatt's Code, (with slight variations,) as far as they were applicable. In conformity with the foregoing resolutions, a signal-book has been prepared, and accompanies this report. In submitting this volume, we have only to remark, as regards the general contents, that it does not materially differ from other signal- books. The general principles of the code, and directions for its practical working, are explained in the commencement of the book ; but we de- sire to point out to your Lordships the main advantages which it appears to possess over any other code that we have had before us : First, its comprehensiveness and distinctness, the combination of (ft* signs expressing the nature of the signal made — two flags or symbols in a hoist always meaning either danger or urgency — and the signals through- out being arranged in a cousecutive series, so that any individual signal, whether a word or a sentence, may readily be found ; secondly, that the Digitized by Google XII flags and pendants are so arranged as by their position to characterize the signals made ; thus, In signals made with two signs— Tbe Burgee uppermost represents \" Attention signals A Pendant uppermost represents u Compass signals f And a square Flag uppermost represents. \" Danger signals In signals composed of four signs — The Burgee uppermost represents \" Geographical f* A Pendant uppermost represents \" Vocabulary And a square Flag uppermost represents . \" Ships' Names and, thirdly, that tbe arrangement of tbe code is such as to hold out to fordgners the same advantages tbat it affords our own marine. Part I is tbat which, by translation, may be made a universal lan- guage of signals. II is intended tbat tbe corresponding combination of any two or more of the 18 signal flags wbicb any nation adopting the commercial code may please to employ shall always have tbe same meaning, in whatever language tbe sigual may bo expressed ; and it will only remain for those nations who choose to adopt the code to make a dictionary or alphabetical index to the words and sentences so arranged, which, corresponding with Part II of the English code, will be the for- eigners' national vocabulary, as Part II of our own code is the English vocabulary. A further advantage is, that the international signals, consisting of all such words and sentences as can ordinarily be required for any pur- pose, are confined within the limit of the three flag signals, excepting only the geographical table, which from the number of places, &c, required to be indicated, it was not found possible to include within that limit. In short, if an Englishman or a foreigner desires, with such a code be- fore him, to make a signal, he is enabled to express his wishes by referring to the Alphabetical Part II of his code, and be will there And tbe com- bination of letters or flags which must be used. On the other hand, if an Englishman or a foreigner wishes to decipher or make out any signal taken from this code, tchich is to be mutually intelligible, he is enabled to do so by referring to Part I of his signal-book, in which the meaning of the sigual displayed is at once obtained— that meaning being the same iu all languages. Part II of the code is the national vocabulary and index to the sig- nals arranged in Part I; but it is far more comprehensive, and contains much that is not to be found iu Part I. This part is alphabetically arranged throughout, and opposite to each word or sentence are placed the letters or signs by which it is to be ex- pressed, either to tbe right or to the left hand. If the word or sentence required to be iudicated has any letters set against it to the right, it will be fouud in the international Part I, and can be used for communicating in a foreign language, but not otherwise: We entertain the hope tbat, should the code be appreciated and enter into general use, at some future day all nations may agree to use one set of flags for commercial purposes, aud thus complete a mode of universal communication. Iu the mean time we recommend that foreign maritime states be in- vited to forward plates of the signal flags which they have in use on board their own nierchaut-ships , in older that a corresjiondiug arrange- XIII ment of symbols may bo mutually agreed upon, should they think proper to adopt the code; but it should be borne in mind that, to reap the full benefit of the code, the Hags and pendants to be employed ought to be in shape and order similar to those proposed by us. We have the honor to be, my Lords, your Lordships* obedient servants F. W. BE ISC HEY. CHAS.lt. D. BETH UN E. ROBERT FITZROY. HENRY B. BAX. GEO. A. HALSTED. GEORGE DENNY. W.C. HARNETT. J. M ON I) EL. J. H. BROWN. Walter F. Lakkins, Secretary. a. Object of the Code.— The International Code has for its object to supply the ineaus of communication between ships at sea, whatever their nationality. It contains the elements of a universal maritime language, which, having been adopted by the principal maritime nations, and translated whenever necessary, has been officially published by the re- spective governments, for the use of their war and merchant navies. The original arrangement of the code-signals being strictly adhered to in all cases, and an entirely similar set of signal-flags or other symbols being always used, it is quite practicable for any two vessels of different nationalities, whether war or merchant, to communicate intelligibly by precise signal equivalents in their different languages, eveu when nei- ther understands the language spoken by the other. 3. Description of the Code. — The International Code is comprised in two parts: Part I consists, first, of General Signals, including such words, phrases, and sentences as are commonly required in communications — questions and answers — by signals between One ship and another at sea, or be- tween a ship in the offing and a signal-station ou shore; and, secondly, of Geographical Signals, including the names of different places upon the globe, principally of sea-ports or maritime towns. Part II, on the other hand, consists of an arrangement, in alphabetical order, of the words, phrases, and sentences of Part I, together with an alphabetical spelling-table and many additional words not included in the latter; including, also, an alphabetical arrangement of the geo- graphical signals of Part I; so that, in reality, Part II may be regarded, essentially, as an Index to Part I. The signal representatives, or ciphers, of the International Code, con- sist of different combinations, in sets of two, three, and four letters each, of the following eighteen consonant letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W. The two-letter sets are combinations of B with the 17 other letters Digitized by Google XIV in which B is the leading letter ; then, those of 0 with the 17 other let- ters ; and so on through all the letters to W ; so that we have— BO, CB, DB, etc., to WB. BD, CD, DC, etc., to WC. &c, &c, &c, &c. The three-letter sets are successive combinations of each set of two letters with the 16 other letters; or— BCD, CBD, etc., to WBC. BDC, CDB, etc., to WCB. &c, &c, &c. The four- letter sets are successive combination of each set of three letters with the 15 other letters ; or— BCDF, CBDF, etc., to WBCD. BDCF, ODBF, etc., to WCBD. &c, &c, &c. The whole number of possible combinations thus obtainable, each different from every other, is as follows : Of the two-letter sets 306 Of the three-letter sets 4,896 Of the fonr-letter sets 73,440 Total number 78,642 In applying these combinations to the different signals of the code, the two-letter sets, as the simplest, are reserved for important and urgent signals. These are seen in Part I, pages 1-4. The three-letter sets are, for a similar reason, reserved for the other general signals of Part I, which are seen in pages 5-77. The four-letter sets are reserved for the following applications. From — BCDF to BWVT for Geographical Signals of Parts I and II, and from — CBDF to FWVT for the Alphabetical Signals of Part II. The foregoing combinations are sufficient, with a considerable number to spare, for all the signals of the code. 4. The Code-List of Ships.— The four-letter combinations from GQBO to W VTS are reserved for the Distinguishing Signals of the Ships of each nationality using the International Codej of which, so far as may be required, the 1,440 combinations from— GQBC to GWVT are used for Men-of-war, and the 53,040 combina- tions from — BBCD to WVTS are used for Merchant-ships. The assignment of these signal-combinations to the names of ships XV is left to the government of each nation, within the limits here pre- scribed. 5. Description of the Code-Flags or Symbols.— The symbols of the International Code consist of 18 flags, namely: 1 Burgee, 4 Pennants, and 13 Square Flngs — representing the eighteen consonant letters of the alphabet, which are used as ciphers of the code. There is, in addition, a \"Code-Pennant,\" which is used as the Code- Signal, and also as the Answering- Signal of the code. These flags, with their respective significations, are shown in the opposite tabular arrangement,* and may be described as follows: BURGEE. B Bed, swallow-tail. PENNANTS. C White, with red spot. D Blue, with white spot. F Bed, with white spot. G Yellow-blue, in two vertical stripes. SQUARE FLAGS. H White-red, in two vertical stripes. J. Blue-white- blue, in three horizontal stripes. K Yellow-blue, in two vertical stripes. L Blue and yellow, in four alternate checks. M Blue, with white diagonal cross. N Blue and white iu sixteen alternate checks. P Blue, with white center. Q Yellow — quarantine. B Bed, with yellow right-cross. S White, with blue center. T Bed-white-blue, in three vertical stripes. V White, with red diagonal cross. W Blue-white-red, in three borders. CODE-PENNANT. Code-signal Bed and white, in five vertical stripes. Used also as \" Answering-Signal.\" The flags are hoisted in combinations of two, three, or four, according to the number of letters in the combination, which represents the signal shown. No distinguishing flag or pennant is used to give the same • Meaning the Plate of Signal-Flags. Digitized by Google * XVI series of signals a different meaning. Each signal has throughout the code but one signification. A signal is always made in one twist in one place. The nature of the signals is indicated by the number of flags hoisted, % whether two, three, or four together, thus : Signals of Two Flags, with— The Burgee uppermost, are Attention Signals. A Pennant uppermost, are Compass Signals. A Square Flag uppermost, are Urgent Danger or Distress Signals. Signals of Three Flags — Relate to general subjects of inquiry or communication, including latitude, longitude, aud time signals. Signals of Four Flags, with — The Burgee uppermost, are Geographical Signals. The Pennant C, D, or F uppermost, are Spelling and Vocabulary Signals. The Pennant G uppermost, are names of Men-of-war. A Square Flag uppermost, are names of Merchant-ships. Single Flags are not used for Code-Signals, with the exception of the \" Affirmative,\" \" Negative,\" and \" Answering\" Pennants. The Ensign or National Colors being always shown whenever the dis- tinguishing signal of a ship (4) is displayed, there will be no difficulty in the complete identification of that ship by the vessel or shore-station to which the signal is addressed.
