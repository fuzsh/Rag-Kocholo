The Executive Council of the American Fedora of Labor has the present week issued a pronunciaineuto denouncing wage decreases and urging the State and Federal Governments to devise extensive plans for public improvements in the shape of road­ building and the like* as a means of preventing the unemployment situation f r o m becoming more acute. Si heme> of this kind afford no true remedy for the <xisting mu mplo,ment. The great need of the times continues to be increased production. Society in tliis respect suffers from a sort of deadlock. And the key log in the jam is labor costs. At the risk of being tedious it cannot too often be insisted that for the well-being of the 100,000,000 people of the l nited States wage deflation must somehow be brought about. Certainly labor costs are still en­ tirely too high. Farm products are selling at prices so low as to prevent the farmer from buying city goods. This hurts manufacturers, and accounts largely for the fact that thousands of workers are out of employment who have only the empty satis­ faction of know ing that wages are kept up. The irony of it is that wages kept up means trade kept dow n and labor kept out of work. Reduced wages would mean greater employment, increased produc­ tion, lower prices, lower cost of living for every­ body—labor, of course, included— increased buying pow er, and therefore increased consumption and a return to normal prosperity. Labor stands in its own light. Retail prices are still high, but they have had to come down somewhat. The chief trou­ ble is high labor costs everywhere outside of the farm freezing out the farmer as a buyer, although he represents 55% of this country’s population. Freezing out 50,000,000 people or more is surely not a very brilliant idea. Take the case of steel, for in­ stance. Wages in that trade, despite the latest cut, are still 50% above those of 1915, while the price of steel is only 16%% above that of 1915, and the cost of living is only 30% above that of 1915. It is labor costs everywhere that soar above everything else and handicap the trade of the United States in purblind disregard of labor's own interests. Meanwhile, taxes are very high, and it is expected that more than 8510,000,000 will be collected by the United States Government on Sept. 15 from income and profit taxes, when the third quarterly install­ ment becomes due. And more tax payments will fall due on Dec. 15. Production is staggering under a load that must be eased somehow. The deflation of the price of labor has been slight; it has declined less than a third of what the products of the farmer have. This is inequitable, and the glaring disparity will have to be corrected before prosperity can re­ turn to the United States. l ion Canada’s foreign exports in July, reflecting very clearly a decided decrease in the shipments of agri­ cultural and forest products, and lesser but general­ ly important declines in all other of the various classifications into which the commodities are seg­ regated, showed a moderate falling off from June, but a strikingly heavy loss from the aggregate for the corresponding month a year ago. The imports likewise exhibited an unusual contraction from last year, having been less than half the total then re­ ported, with all classes of goods sharing in the dim­ inution, but agricultural products, textiles and [V ol. 113. icon and steel most largely. The net result for July is a small adverse or import balance. Briefly, the \\alim of tin* exports of merchandise (domestic and foreign combined) in July was $5(1,440,143 against $!()(>,ul 1,390 in 1920, and for the four months of the Dominion’s fiscal year (April I to July 31 1921, inclusive) they were $220,942,272 against $351,095,173. Imports for July were the smallest, with the exception of those for June, since April 1919, and at $02,405,890 contrast with $127,268,811 last year. The total since April 1, at only $253,802,402, com­ pares with no less than $473,572,589 in 1920, which then established a four months’ high record aggre­ gate. Finally 1In import balance for the month at * $.>,905,747 contrasts with a like import excess of $20,357,421 last year, while for the four months the merchandise imports exceeded the exports by $32,920,185 against $121,877,417 last year. Our cotton crop review for the year 1920-21, cov­ ering as usual the most complete data on the mar­ keting, distribution and manufacture of the staple, which it has been possible to secure, and including such explanatory comments thereon as seem to be required, is presented on subsequent pages of this issue of the “ Chronicle,” and should, we believe, be found ol much interest and value to those who desire to keep informed on the subject. The purpose of these annual reviews, which have been continued for over half a century, or since immediately following the dose of the Civil War, is primarily to present all essential statistics bearing upon the growing of the staple and its manufacture in the United States. That plan has been adhered to in the current issue, but now, as heretofore, data for all other countries in which cotton is either produced or manufactured into goods, and from which reliable information can be secured, are made a part of the report. It fol­ lows, therefore, that within the comparatively lim­ ited space devoted to them, these reviews do furnish as comprehensive and complete a history of the world’s cotton crops and manufacture as it is possi­ ble to publish so soon after the close of the season. During the course of the European war and for a time thereafter official red tape rendered very dif­ ficult the obtaining of some much-needed informa­ tion, and even now some delay has been experienced in securing data quite essential to the correct com­ piling of the statistics. It is reasonable to suppose, however, that within another twelve months such hindrances as are yet in evidence will have entirely d isappeared. The striking feature of the season of 1920-21 was the collapse in the price of the raw material. Opening at 40c per pound (July 31 1920) for mid­ dling uplands spot cotton in the New York market, the following June— June 20 1921— saw the quota­ tion down to 10.85 cents; there was some recovery, and at the end of the crop year the price was 12.15c. The average for the season was 17.95c, against 38.25c in 1919-20. The significance of the decidedly reduced price of the late season becomes apparent when it is noted that on the basis of the average price for the season at New York the 1920-21 commercial crop of approximately 11,350,000 bales had a value of only about 1,048 million dollars, whereas the yield of the preceding season, only about 7% greater, had a value of no less than 2,375 million dollars. An appreciable decrease in the consumption of cotton in the United States, shared in by both A ug. 27 1921.] THE CHKONICLE North and South, but most largely in the former sec­ tion, is the outcome of manufacturing operations of the season, this finding explanation in the reduced demand for virtually all descriptions of goods for home use, and a contraction of the export trade. Consumption at the South dropped from 11,724,222 bales in 1919-20 to 3,1.68,105 bales in 1920-21, and, concurrently, the decrease at the North was from 3,025^940 bales to 2,125,035 bales. The commercial crop of the United States for 1920-21 (as distin­ guished from the actual growth, which was 13% million bales), proves to have been the sixth in a series of short yields and the smallest since 1909-10, much cotton being held back, however, in the inter­ ior on account of the low price. It totaled 11,355,180 bales, or 862,372 bales less than that of 1919-20, and some 3% millions beloAv the high record of 191415. The world’s consumption of American cotton for the season was approximately 10,400,000 bales. Our aggregate of cotton goods expoi’ts was in both quantity and value considerably under 1919-20, but in excess of all earlier years. A marked decrease in the consumption of foreign cotton by mills in the United States is to be noted, the decline having been from 414,829 bales to 215,231 bales. With the world’s aggregate crop of cotton in 192021 very much more than sufficient to meet consump­ tive requirements, the previously existing surplus supply was considerably increased, and consequent­ ly the carry-over at the end of the season exceeded by an appreciable amount that at the close of 191920, or any earlier year. The carry-over of American alone, as we compiled it, was 10,392,976 bales, against 7,062,041 bales in 1919-20, but of the stock remaining in the United States no less than 787,356 bales are linters. It is claimed with good reason that at least 1,000,000 bales included in this Ameri­ can carry-over consists of cotton or linters abso­ lutely unspinnable. A treaty of peace between Germany and the United States was signed in Berlin at 5 :20 o’clock Thursday afternoon. It must now be ratified by the United States Senate and the German Reichstag. The document was made public in Washing­ ton at 9 :25 the same evening by Secretary of State Hughes, and a reprint of it will be found on subse quent pages. Prominent officials of the German Government, financial experts, and Ellis Loring Dresel, the American Commissioner in Berlin, had been at work for several weeks on “ a formal peace treaty with the United States.” It was reported in Berlin ad­ vices at the beginning of the week that they had “ agreed on the fundamentals and the document only awaits approval from Washington.” It was added that “this is expected to arrive in a day or two.” In a cablegram from Berlin a few days later the as­ sertion was made that “ contrary to rumors ema­ nating from Washington, no commercial treaty will precede the formal peace pact.” The further asser­ tion was made in the same dispatch that “ the treaty also will defer to a future date the adjustment of all commercial, financial and economic issues involved in the resumption of relations. These will be settled either by a special treaty or through negotiations with the newly established diplomatic missions.” The German Cabinet, at a special session Tues­ day evening, gave final consideration to the treaty. Announcement was made that it would be signed on 883 Wednesday. Dr. Friedrich Rosen, German Foreign Minister, was to sign for the German Government, and Ellis Loring Dresel, United States Commission­ er, for this country. Word came from Berlin Thursday morning that “ the Peace Treaty between the United States and Germany was not signed yes­ terday, as had been intended.” The following ex­ planation of the situation was given by the Asso­ ciated Press correspondent in the German capital: “ The delay in signing resulted from an unexpected technical point raised in connection with the for­ malities as arranged by Ellis Loring Dresel, the United States Commissioner, and Dr. Friedrich Rosen, the German Foreign Minister, yesterday. The ceremony of signing was to have taken place at noon at the Foreign Office, but it was postponed at the request of Mr. Dresel, who asked the privi­ lege of querying the Washington Government on the mooted point. At the headquarters of both the American Commission and the German Foreign Of­ fice it was said that the technicality which involved the delay did not affect the contents or character of the treaty, as both Governments had reached a full accord on the official text some days ago. German editors had been summoned to the Foreign Office for a discussion of the treaty this afternoon, but the conference was postponed pending the receipt by Commissioner Dresel of a reply from Washington.” As noted above, the document actually was signed at 5 o’clock Thursday afternoon in the office of For­ eign Minister Rosen in the Wilhelmstrasse, “ around the corner from the offices of the American Commis­ sion.” The advices stated that “the signing occu­ pied about 10 minutes.” Dr. Friedrich Rosen, For­ eign Minister, affixed his signature in behalf of Ger­ many, and Ellis Loring Dresel for the United States. In making public the text of the treaty, Secretary Hughes issued an explanatory statement, in which he averred that “ the compact assures to the United States all the rights accruing to this country under the Treaty of Versailles, but provides specifically that the United States shall not be bound by the clauses of the Versailles compact relating to the League of Nations.” The two following clauses of this statement are of special importance and signifi­ cance to the United States: “ The result is to put the United States on a footing with the other Allied and Associated Powers with respect to all the rights defined in all these clauses. It is provided that the United States in availing itself of the rights and ad­ vantages stipulated in these provisions of the treaty will do so in a manner consistent with the rights accorded to Germany under such provisions. The treaty provides that the United States shall not be bound by any of the provisions of the treaty which relate to the League of Nations.” Word was received here from Berlin yesterday afternoon that Mathias Erzberger, former Vice-Pre­ mier and Minister of Finance of Germany, had been assassinated near Offenburg, Baden, “ where he was sojourning with* his family.” Several other at­ tempts had been made upon his life since he came into prominence politically. On Wednesday afternoon, in Vienna, the treaty of peace between the United States and Austria was signed. The signing took place at 12:57 o’clock, in the Foreign Office. The ceremony was said to have been extremely simple. Arthur Hugh Frazier, 884 THE CHRONICLE American Commissioner iu Vienna, acted for the Washington Government. Chancellor Schober signed for Austria. The Associated Press corre­ spondent said that “ the terms of the treaty are be­ ing withheld for the present. It is understood that the Government does not desire public discussion of the treaty pending its ratification by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Parliament. The commit­ tee will meet Saturday [to-day] to prepare the reso­ lution of ratification of the treaty for consideration by Parliament when it reassembles.” [V ol. 113 tional convention of the Sinn Fein party organiza­ tion to meet in Dublin. The delegates who will come together will constitute a body somewhat simi­ lar to a conclave of Democratic or Republican State committeemen in Washington.” The reply of the Dail Eireann to Premier Lloyd George was to be sent by special courier Thursday evening, and it was expected that it would reach Downing Street yesterday morning, according to the Dublin correspondent of the New York “ Times.” He added that “ throughout to-day [Wed­ nesday] the Cabinet has been at the Mansion House drawing up the historic document in its final form. This will be submitted in secret to the Dail Eireann to morrow [Thursday] for formal approval. The proceedings are expected to be brief.” The Asso­ ciated Press representative in Dublin cabled that “ the belief was expressed here to-night [Wednes­ day] that the Dail Eireann’s answer to the pro­ posals of Premier Lloyd George for peace in Ireland will be a refusal of the terms, but that the refusal will be followed with arguments seeking to induce Mr. Lloyd George to continue the negotiations.” The Sinn Fein reply to Lloyd George arrived at his offi­ cial residence in Downing Street at one o’clock Thursday afternoon, considerably in advance of the time indicated in a Dublin dispatch. The document was placed before the Cabinet Council and was con­ sidered for several hours. The London correspond­ ent of the Associated Press said Thursday evening that “ it is learned that official circles here do not regard to-day’s communication as terminating the negotiations, although the contents of the reply are being withheld pending a Cabinet conference and an agreement between the Irish and British on a joint communication to be issued to the press.” Accord­ ing to a cablegram from Dublin, “ one who has seen the text” was quoted as saying that “ the Irish Re­ publican Cabinet’s reply to the letter of Prime Min­ ister Lloyd George of August 13 leaves ‘an unmis­ takable opening’ for a continuation of the peace ne­ gotiations.” In the dispatches from London and Dublin yesterday morning much the same idea was given. In a cablegram later in the day it was as­ serted that “ the reply of President De Valera to Premier Lloyd George rejects the offer made by the British Premier for the Cabinet. It urges peace on a possible broad principle of Government by the consent of the governed, and says the Dail Eireann is ready to negotiate if this principle is agreed upon.” The British Cabinet gave the reply prompt consideration. Premier Lloyd George made re­ sponse yesterday afternoon. Referring to De Va­ lera’s demand for recognition of Ireland as a for­ eign Power, the Prime Minister asserted that he “ is playing with phrases to suggest that the princi­ ple of Government by the consent of the governed compels recognition of that demand on our part, or that in repudiating it we are straining geographical and historical considerations to justify a claim to ascendancy over the Irish race.” Lloyd George also warned the Sinn Fein leader that, “ owing to the action being taken in certain quarters, it is dan­ gerous to prolong the negotiations.” He added that while he could not continue an exchange of notes, “he will be happy to meet Mr. De Valera and his colleagues again.” According to cablegrams from London, Dublin and Belfast at the beginning of the week, it was be­ lieved that a settlement of the Anglo-Irish dispute would be reached within a reasonable time. It was stated that in Dublin that feeling was “ due to the speech of Prime Minister Lloyd George in Parlia­ ment, which Sinn Fein leaders interpret as indicat­ ing a real desire for settlement and willingness to go faf to obtain it.” The correspondent of the Chi­ cago “ Tribune” in the same Irish city made the fol­ lowing significant statement: “The Irish leaders are under tremendous pressure from Irish-Americans and from the Dominions to make an honorable settlement with England. They are receiving dozens of cables daily, warning them that they will alien­ ate the public opinion of the world if they take what appears to be an unreasonable stand. This fact is going to have much influence on their course next week.” The Dail Eireann held a secret session in Dublin on Monday “ to decide and reply to the British Government’s offer.” That gathering was preceded by a conference of the Sinn Fein Cabinet at Mansion House the afternoon before, “ for the purpose of making final arrangements for to-mor­ row’s secret session of the Parliament.” The latter convened Monday forenoon, an hour late, according to the Dublin correspondent of the New York “Times,” because of “ the late arrival of the ‘President,’ who drove up to Mansion House in a taxicab accompanied by Michael Collins, Countess Markieviecz and Mary MacSwiney.” That session lasted until 2 p.m., and was resumed again at 4 o’clock, and at 6 adjourned until the following day. One of the members of Dail Eireann was quoted as having expressed the opinion that the next public session would be held yesterday [Friday]. Such a session was held and De Valera read the Sinn Fein reply. He and the Cabinet were re-elected. The report came from Dublin Tuesday morning that the Most Rev. Ed­ ward Mulhar, Lord Bishop of Dromore, had arrived there “ with a message from The highest authority,’ which he delivered to Eamonn de Valera and the other Sinn Fein leaders.” The correspondent added that “ there were long consultations over the mes­ sage.” In another dispatch from Dublin later in the day the assertion was made that “ the Vatican has not intervened in the Irish negotiations, accord­ ing to an official announcement by the Sinn Fein Cabinet this afternoon.” It was declared that “ a message, which was delivered to President De Va­ lera by Bishop Mulhar of Dromore, was not from Rome.” According to the London correspondent of the New York “ Tribune” Tuesday morning, “ a sort of limited referendum on the peace terms offered to As had been predicted in cable dispatches from Ireland by Premier Lloyd George had been arranged by the Dail Eireann, which has summoned a na­ Riga, “ the agreement between the United States A ug. 27 1921.] 1 THE C H R O N IC L E 885 and Russia, providing for American relief for the |submitted to the directors of the relief work.

The representative of the Chicago “ Tribune” said that, while poverty was in evidence, famine was not visible. Word has been received here that the first shipment of food under the new agreement was made a week ago to-day. The advices stated that “ 1,000 tons of balanced rations were shipped from Riga to the Petrograd district and 2,500 tons to the Moscow district.” There has been no change in official discount rates at leading European centres from 5% in Berlin and Belgium; 5Yfflo in Paris and London; 6% in Rome, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Madrid; and 4 ^ % in Holland and Switzerland. In London private discount rates are a shade easier, having been reduced to 4 11-16% for short bills and 4% % for three months, against 4 ^ % and 4^g% last week. Open market discounts in Paris are still at 5%, and 4 ^ % in Switzerland for long and short bills, unchanged. Call money in London is also lower at 3% % , against 4% a week ago. So far as can be learned, no reports have been received by cable of open market rates at other centres. The Bank of England this week reported a trifling loss in gold holdings, namely, £4,417. Total reserve, however, was expanded £266,000, because of an­ other contraction in note circulation of £271,000. Moreover, deposits were heavily reduced, so that the proportion of reserve to liabilities advanced to 15.60%, which compares with 14.75% a week ago and 14.30% last year. This is the highest percentage for the current year, the next nearest being 15.28% in the week ended May 18, while the lowest thus far was 8.83% on Jan. 6. The highest percentage for the year 1920 was 23.49%, attained in the week ending March 18. In public deposits there was an increase of £421,000, but other deposits declined £6,360,000 and loans on Government securities fell £5,325,000. Loans on other securities registered a contraction of £867,000, to £78,658,000. Last year the total was £75,883,141 and in 1919 £79,569,477. Threadneedle Street’s stock of gold on hand now stands at £128,402,703, in comparison with £123,028,857 in 1920 and £88,244,093 a year earlier. Reserves total £20,888,000, as against £16,585,307 last year and £26,893,648 in 1919. Circulation aggregates £125,964,000, which contrasts with £124,893,550 and £79,800,445 one and two years ago, respectively. The Bank’s official minimum discount rate has been maintained' at the 5j/£% rate, un­ changed. Clearings through the London banks for the week were £603,211,000, as against £615,294,000 a week ago and £676,644,000 last year.

The Bank’s gold holdings now aggre­ gate 5,522,131,875 francs, comparing with 5,590,239,588 francs at this time last year and with 5,572,423,536 francs the year before; of these amounts 1,948,367,056 francs were held abroad in 1921 and 1,978,278,416 francs in both 1920 and 1919. During the week advances fell off 15,313,000 francs. In­ creases were registered in the other items as follows: silver, 559,000 francs; bills discounted, 15,491,000 francs; Treasury deposits, 17,493,000 francs; and general deposits, 25,387,000 francs. A further con­ traction of 200,253,000 francs occurred in note cir­ culation, bringing the total outstanding down to 36,783,000,000 francs. This contrasts with 37,904,507,195 francs on the corresponding date in 1920 and with 35,090,399,220 francs the year previous. On July 30 1914, just prior to the outbreak of war, the amount was only 6,683,184,785 francs.

Probably the most striking feature was a reduction of the enormous sum of 9,025,854,000 marks in note circulation. Bankers here with German affiliations were unable to give any adequate explanation of this, though it is believed that recent tax collections have enabled the Reichsbank temporarily to withdraw this huge amount from circulation. Other noteworthy changes were an expansion in bills discounted of 3,849,069,000 marks and an increase in deposits of 3,572,359,000 marks. Gold fell off 3,000 marks, but total coin and bullion increased 163,000 marks. Treasury certifi­ cates were reduced 448,445,000 marks, while notes of other banks gained 1,834,000 marks. Investments increased 8,904,000 marks, but there were reductions in advances of 1,758,000 marks. Other securities 911.611.000 marks and other liabilities 130,527,000 marks. The German Bank reports its stock of gold on hand as 1,091,551,000 marks. This compares with 1,091,591,000 marks in 1920 and 1,106,480,000 marks the year preceding. Note circulation has been brought down to 68,206,666,000 marks, as against 77,236,520,000 marks a week earlier, but compares with 56,461,863,000 marks last year, 28.554.660.000 marks in 1919 and 1,890,893,000 marks the week of July 25 1914. From the Federal Reserve Bank statement , issued late on Thursday afternoon, it will be seen that there has been a further gain in gold reserves and at the same time curtailment in rediscounting operations. For the twelve reporting banks, gold holdings were expanded $19,000,000. Bills discounted declined $17,000,000, while the total volume of bills on hand is now $1,530,000,000, a reduction of $24,000,000 for A ug. 27 1921.] THE 887 C H R O N IC L E the week. There was again a shrinkage in total earn­ ing assets, this time of $30,000,000, to $1,769,334,000, against $3,289,672,000 in the corresponding week of 1920. Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation were reduced $18,000,000, but deposits increased $2,000,000. The New York bank reported an increase in gold reserves of no less than $39,000,000. Total bills on hand fell off $14,000,000 and now aggregate $374,529,000, which compares with $1,020,000,000 last year. Here also total earning assets declined ($20,000,000), but deposits registered an increase of $16,000,000. Notwithstanding this, however, and as a result of the additions to the gold holdings, the ratio of reserve was advanced 2.4% to 74.6% in the local bank and 0.7% for the system as a whole, to 66.5%. The outstanding feature of last week’s statement of New York Clearing House banks and trust com­ panies, issued on Saturday, was again a substantial contraction in loans, discounts and investments, namely, $39,049,000, which brings the decline for the two weeks about $80,000,000 and $200,000,000 since the beginning of July. Since the high record point of October last, loans have been cut approxi­ mately $1,116,000,000, and the total outstanding is the smallest since July 1918. This is said to reflect primarily liquidation of securities. Aside from this, however, the week’s advances and declines were relatively unimportant except in the case of Govern­ ment deposits. Net demand deposits fell only $1,887.000, but there was a drawing down of Govern­ ment deposits by $60,903,000 to $81,177,000.' Total demand deposits, exclusive of Government deposits, are $3,560,460,000. Net time deposits are $210,200.000, an increase of $2,144,000 for the week. A decline of $2,642,000 was recorded in cash in own vaults of members of the Federal Reserve Bank to $69,728,000 (not counted as reserve), but reserves of member banks with the Reserve Bank were expanded $544,000. Cash held in vault by State banks and trust companies increased $257,000, and reserves kept by State banks and trust companies in other depositories increased $137,000. Surplus gained $1,171,720, bringing up the total of excess reserves to $18,975,670. The figures here given for surplus are on the basis of 13% reserves above legal requirements for member banks of the Federal Reserve System, but do not include cash in vault amounting to $69,728,000 held by these member banks on Saturday last. The local money market was quiet and rather nom­ inal. The general tendency, however, was toward greater ease. Call money dropped to 5% on Thurs­ day and renewed and loaned at that figure on the Stock Exchange yesterday. For several days loans were said to have been made in the so-called outside market at about H % under the ruling rate on the Board. Comparatively little time money has been offered. By some lenders a little more money was put out than in recent weeks. Toward the close the rates were nominally 5% @ 6%, but, generally speaking, borrowers were not disposed to bid actively. The developments during the week were not of a character to have a pronounced effect upon the money market. Withdrawals by the Government from local institutions were not large. No big pieces of financing were put through. Government opera­ tions were not extensive in any direction. A week ago, and during the early part of this week, the pre­ diction was made in some circles that probably both call and time money would be higher this week in anticipation of the September 1 disbursements. Ae already noted, the tendency was in the opposite direction, and when call money renewed and loaned at 5% yesterday the idea became rather general that the market might start off with a correspondingly easy tone next week, though higher rates before the close of that period would not cause surprise. Special attention was given to the further increase in the reserve ratio of the Federal Reserve System and par­ ticularly to the advance in that of the New York institution from 72.2% to 74.6%. It is reasonable to expect that from now on rather heavy demands will be made for two or three months upon New York institutions for the moving of the crops. Wheat harvesting is pretty well over except in the extreme Northwest, and in Canada. Generally speaking, the grain crops appear to be pretty satisfactory. The increase in the volume of general business has not been sufficient to place any new burden uporv the money market. As to specific rates for money, call loans during the week were a shade easier and the range was 5@5)4%? in comparison with 5}4@6% last week, for both mixed collateral and all-industrials alike. As was the case in the preceding week, there was no change for the first three days, so that on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday a single rate of 5)4% prevailed, this being the high, the low and the renewal basis on each of these days. Thursday still easier conditions prevailed, and rates declined to 5@5)4%, though renewals continued to be negotiated at 5)4%. On Friday there was no range; 5% was the only rate quoted. This is the first time since Aug. 2 that call loans have touched 5%. Outside of the Stock Ex-* change loans were made at 4)4% and a few small amounts as low as 4%. Funds were in freer supply, while the inquiry was limited. In time money also offerings were larger than for some little time and the range of quotations declined to 5 ^ @ 6 % , as against 6@6)4% last week. Not much business was done and while fixed date money was available in moderate amounts for all maturities, there were few borrowers; hence trading was dull practically throughout. All­ industrial money continues to be dealt in at 14 of 1% above these figures. Mercantile paper was in fairly good demand and sixty and ninety days’ endorsed bills receivable and six months’ names of choice character remain at 6%, with names less well known at 6)4%, the same as a week earlier. Country banks were the principal buyers. Banks and bankers’ acceptances continue at levels previously current, but despite the easing in the call market, trading was comparatively quiet. Not many bills are making their appearance and interest on the buying side is correspondingly limited.

Fcr the time being the market seemed less inclined to follow the lead of London and foreign selling was not so much in evidence. Furthermore, the supply of offerings was light and this had an important influence in maintaining price levels. As yet the volume of grain and cotton bills making their appearance on the market is small, though brokers predict a material broadening in this respect in the near future. Speculative operations have been rather less of a factor and the market is described as largely a “ traders’ market,” with moderate price fluctuations according to the wants of “ legitimate” buyers and sellers. The close was under the best for the week. One explanation for the firmness displayed was that Germany had accumulated a somewhat too large supply of marks and was now reversing her pro­ cedure of buying marks and selling sterling, by offer­ ing large blocks of reichsmarks for sale and making pin-chases of sterling. Bankers are practically a unit in declaring that the market is likely to be almost wholly dominated by operations incidental to repara­ tions settlements and that more or less violent changes in currency values are practically inevitable for a good while to come. Considerable interest attaches to the decision of the Inter-Allied Finance Conference to take steps as far as possible to prevent the recurrence of demoral­ ized conditions as a result of reparations settlements and it is learned that bankers here are strongly in favor of the proposed conference to be held in Wash­ ington for the purpose of stabilizing the foreign exchanges. It is understood, however, that official Washington is opposed to'any such move. So far as could be learned, neither the signing of the AustroAmerican and German-Ameriean peace pacts nor announcement of liberal advances by the War Finance Corporation to finance cotton and wheat growers had any effect on actual market price levels. Trading was generally dull with important operators for the most part out of the market and inclined to await the outcome of pending international de­ velopments. As to the day-to-day rates, sterling exchange on Saturday of last week was a shade firmer and demand mbved up fractionally to 3 65% @ 3 00%, with cable transfers at 3 6 6 ^ @ 3 00% and sixty days’ bills at [ V ol. 113, 3 60(u,3 603 s; trading-, ; however, was exceptionally dull. On Monday there was no increase in activity and quotations were again slightly lowered to 3 05% @ 3 66 for demand, 3 05%(ci)3 00% for cable transfers and 3 5936@3 6034 for sixty days. A better under­ tone was noted on Tuesday and following the receipt of firmer cable quotations from London demand sterling moved up to 3 05%@3 66 3-16, cable transfers to 3 66@3 66 11-16 and sixty days to 3 59%@3 60 7-16; some increase in the volume of transactions was also reported. On Wednesday what was termed “ legitimate buying” on a liberal scale, together with scant offerings, brought about an advance of more than 3 cents in the pound to 3 6934 for demand, the low was 3 00%, while cable transfers ranged at 3 67@3 00% and sixty days at 3 6034@ 3 03%.

Closing quotations were 3 02% for sixty days, 3 6834 for demand and 3 69 for cable transfers. Commer­ cial sight bills finished at 3 6834 > sixty days at 3 03%,, ninety days at 3 6034> documents for pay­ ment (sixty days) at 3 633/6, and seven-day grain bills at 3 6734. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 3 6834 • The week’s gold shipments were numerous and included consignments of the precious metal from many parts of the globe. Gold coin and bullion from India and England were received on the Aquitania, valued at $ 6,000,000, of which 115 boxes came from India and 110 from England. The France brought $8,000,000 from French ports. The Drottningholm from Sweden has arrived with $4,5 0 0,0 0 0, while German gold and silver amounting to $5,8 5 0,0 0 0 came in on the Sudbury from Hamburg. The bulk of this amount was said to be intended for the British Treasury on account of reparation payments. M inor amounts of gold have been received as follows: Six packages of gold coin and raw gold on the M atura from Triniday; $3,250 on the Aurora from Curacao, six boxes and 29 bars on the Anna from Colombia, seven packages gold and silver, gold bars and crude gold, and ten cases of American currency and Liberty bonds on the Allianea from Cristobal; one box gold on the Oropesa from Southampton, seven cases on the Caracas from the Dutch W est Indies, valued at $64,000; $43,000 on the Crofton Hall from Uruguay; $24,000 on the Ulua from Costa Rica, and three boxes gold bars; coins on the W esterdyk from Holland, and one box and eight kegs gold and silver coin on the Huron from Santo Domingo. Gold valued at $7,785,000 is expected on the La Savoie, Olympic, Cedric and La Lorraine. Late Friday it was announced that the Adriatic had arrived from England with about $1,000,000 gold on board. Other late arrivals included $264,000 on the M artha Washington from Argentina and Uruguay, $7,000 on the Santa M arta from Colombia, about $24,000 TurkishBritish gold on the River Araxes from Turkey and $367,000 on the Rotterdam from Holland. There were no new developments of moment in Continental exchange. Trading was relatively light and the violent fluctuations of a week ago were chiefly conspicuous by their absence. Reichsmarks once more took the lead and attracted attention by another break, this time to 1 . 1034, a loss of about 14 points from the close on Friday last, but 10 points above the low record of the previous week. The weakness was again said to emanate from London where trading for a time was heavy.

El (1IIT Now that the Conference on Disarmament is as­ sured, avo may look upon it as a great light set over a darkened world. For though it is practical, little will be accomplished unless it is suffused with the divine spirit of love and renunciation. Those who see it in its true significance must behold this spirit shin­ ing through all its being and acts. Out of “ The Shad­ ow” it emerges, sending its rays of hope and trust over the future. B cI oav it the peoples of earth pros­ trate themselves in prayer for deliverance; while above it an invisible host of heaven, “ the dead that have not died in vain,” wait the fulfillment that must not fail. At last, in the history of a tried and troubled humanity, Power assembles to humble it­ self. There is deep meaning in the fact that this is a practical effort to assist the coming of peace. It is true a certain wide scope is given by the inclusion of Far Eastern problems—but the intent plainly is to discover and disclose only the “ relations” that nations should bear to each other that would avoid A ar. There are no problems of reparation and resti­ A tution. No new States are to be formed. Questions of the form of government that peoples should adopt are not involved. Governments in their political nature are to be lightly bound by the agreements to be reached. Peoples rather than autonomies are meeting to resolve to lay down their arms and unite in good-Avill and faith. There must be throughout the world a thrill of joy at this procedure. Fear must coAver into the darkness of oblivion. Hope must Aving its flight into the sun of righteousness. The “ Four Horse­ men,” halted on the precipice of barbarism, must re­ treat in headlong haste, borne backward by their own negation into the lost regions where torture forever dwells alone with terror. Death, famine, pestilence, know not peace. Generations unborn will rise up to call this Conference blessed—if only it shall be true to itself. And those of to-day who toil endlessly only to find their efforts cast into the furnace of hate and poverty will take new courage as they feel the benignity of fellowship cover the yearning earth. No less than this, though we express it lamely, follows! This Conference is ideal because it is prac­ tical. Long ago Virgil wrote, “ I sing of Arms and the Hero.” Not so long ago Edwin Arnold wrote the epics of two saviors of the world—Heroes devoid of Arms. And we must see in this assem­ bling of Powers, the Spirit of Sacrifice, if Public Opinion is at last to triumph over Diplomacy, and, we dare to say, Preparedness. Too long the Hero has been Militarism. Too long the ruler has been Government, acting in its own belief that the only way to secure peace is through ability to war. The peoples of earth welcome as never before the coming of peace through the destruction of the ability to make war! As we look with infinite regret upon the red-flow ing rivers of wrath that stain the past, so must we behold in this Conference the creation of the Foun­ tain of Peace that shall fill the rivers of the future, watering many lands with help and harmony. No language is fulsome in praise of this effort, if only the feeling heart of mankind shall await upon its word. At every fireside, remote and near, true re- 891 ligion must kneel in devout prayer that selfishness shall not cross the doorway of this Council, that petty advantage shall not restrain magnanimity, that the will to do shall find the way, the easy way of the spirit. Of a truth, this Conference is the greatest thing in the Avorhl. Humanity cannot go on in this mad orgy of war. The workman cannot work without tools; the warrior cannot kill without weapons. One step taken away from the bottomless pit of Destruction and the journey to Construction is begun. If the States of this world are ever totally disarmed tin; peoples that maintain them will never consent to the Avaste of a single dollar in warfare. Mankind has been too much concerned with the technique of peace, Avith agreements of Governments, Avitli pro­ portions of power; now—this Conference faces the Spirit of Peace! And this Spirit of Peace is a combination of will and lo\\r to prevent war by no less a practical e method than disarmament. What does disarma­ ment mean if it be not that Governments shall be prevented from nurturing the power to make war? Can peoples arm themselves for “ murder by whole­ sale” that have empty hands and empty treasure ies? That will not vote debts upon generations un­ born and waste their OAvn substance, by appeals to the use of Force—that always ends in settlement ~ y b cessation and compromise? Let the world acclaim this Conference for what it is—an effort to estab­ lish the reign of the Spirit of Peace by reducing the material means of war. CHILI) LABOR LAW AGAIN DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL. A decision on August 22 by Judge James E. Boyd of the Federal District Court at Greensboro, N. C., perhaps marks the beginning of the failure of the latest attempt to suppress Child labor by Federal enactment, for the fate of a previous attempt seems to imply that the final tribunal may sustain Judge Boyd, as it did in the former case. After the subject had been for a number of years more or less in agitation, a bill for suppression of child labor was pushed through Congress in August of 1917, and Avent into effect on September 1, achieving the quite unusual distinction of being pro­ nounced unconstitutional on the day before by this same Federal District Court in North Carolina. This law provided that no producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment in inter­ state commerce, any product of any industrial con­ cern in which, Avithin the last previous 30 days, chil­ dren under 14 had been permitted to Avork, or in Avkick children between 14 and 16 had been em­ ployed or permitted to work more than eight hours in any day, or more than six days in any Aveek, or betAveen the hours of 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. No dealer was to be punished Avho “establishes a guaranty” issued by the producer that there had not been any of the prohibited employment, nor was any employer to be punished for a misstatement about ages, if he acted under erroneous information. The ban was not limited to the product of the forbidden employ­ ment, but applied to the entire product of the of­ fending plant; yet by suspending child labor for 30 days prior to shipment (as might be done in some cases) the ban could be entirely evaded. The particular case under that law was an appli­ cation for an injunction forbidding a cotton mill in 89 't THE CHRONICLE Charlotte from dismissing two boys, the father con­ tending that their wages until reaching 21 belonged to him, and that existing State laws did not forbid their working. A five-to-fonr decision in the 8uprewe Court sustained the court below, Justice Day delivering the opinion, with the concurrence of Jus­ tices Van Devanter, I'itney and McKeynolds and Chief Justice White, while Justice Holmes dissent­ ed, with the concurrence of Justices McKenna, Braudeis and Clarke. In a twofold sense, said Jus­ tice Day, this law was repugnant to the Constitu­ tion, since it not only transcended the authority delegated to Congress over commerce, but “ exerted a power as to a purely local matter to which the Federal authority does not extend.” This was the crux of the matter, but Justice Holmes placed his dissent on the surprising proposition that while a State may regulate its own internal affairs and its own domestic commerce, “ when they seek to send their product across the State line they are no longer within their rights” ; if no Constitution and no Con­ gress existed, he added, the power to send across a boundary line “ would depend upon their neighbors” (as it surely would), but as things are all commerce lies within the regulative power of Congress. Yet Prof. Woodrow Wilson was clearly right when he said, many years ago, in a work on constitutional government, that if the commerce clause “ can be stretched to include the regulation of labor in mills and factories it can be made to embrace every par­ ticular of the industrial organization of the coun­ try . . . the only limitations Congress would ob­ serve, should the Supreme Court assent to such ob­ viously absurd extravagance of interpretation, would be the limitation of opinion and circum­ stances.” And it is equally true that if a tax can be levied for the purpose of accomplishing something other than and different from raising revenue, any­ thing might be clubbed out of existence. The one extravagance is not more marked and absurd than the other. The failure of this attempt led to another, which took the form of a sort of rider on a revenue bill, whereby an extra 10% tax was to be collected on the profits of any concern employing child labor, and it is this which has now been held unconstitu­ tional by Judge Boyd. He holds that regulation of labor is among the powers not delegated to the Na­ tional Government but retained by the States, and that any attempt by Congress to intervene is there­ fore an attempt to usurp reserved powers. Nothing can be said in justification or in extenua­ tion of child labor of the character which these at­ tempts would suppress; a people who do not con­ serve their children waste their chief asset and com­ mit race suicide. These Federal laws therefore at­ tempt to perform a necessary act of national protec­ tion, but attempt it in the wrong manner. This last attempt has the added defect that it seeks to use the power of taxation for a purpose not only outside of revenue, but having the intent and expectation of preventing revenue by suppression of something at which the blow is aimed. The Consti­ tution, of course, commits taxation to Congress in general terms, giving it “power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to .pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,” adding the proviso that all levies shall be “uniform.” Whether we read an “ and” after the word “excises,” or whether we [V ol. 113. interpret the sentence as meaning that to pay the debts, etc., is what taxes are for, we must admit that the primary and natural purpose of taking money is to use it for public expenditures, and neither to deplete the taxpayer’s resources nor to put fetters on his conduct. The most distinctive instance of a suppressive tax in our history was its use, in the Civil War, to force existing banks into the new Na­ tional banking system. That was put on the ground of an overpowering emergency, but we should be slow and loath to repeat emergency actions. The composition of the Supreme Court has changed in the last three years; moreover, as has already been pointed out, that tribunal has lately, and at dates only slightly separated, rendered two irreconcilable decisions concerning this fundamen­ tal question of the sovereignty of States in matters of their police powers. In a case turning on the “ concurrent power” conferred by the Eighteenth Amendment, the Court virtually threw aside the en­ tire doctrine that a State may treat its own police powers as reserved and may legislate accordingly; but in the “ housing” cases the Court virtually sus­ tained those powers without reserve, even as against the Federal Constitution itself. It may therefore be deemed quite possible that the plea of public wel­ fare and of emergency will lead to another blow at State sovereignty by sustaining the power of Con­ gress, in matters of high moment, to enter into a State for regulating its internal affairs, instead of leaving each State, through a growing and enlight­ ened public opinion, to deal righteously with all questions of living. The greatest hazard in emer­ gency conduct is that we may get wonted to it and so attempt to live under a sort of perpetual martial law. There is an analogy between political emer­ gencies and those which call for heroic surgbry as the only alternative to seeing the sufferer die; he may not survive the operation, but if he must die without it the one chance is hazarded. It is the spe­ cial danger of the “emergency” plea that it tends straight to making other emergencies, or to leading us to imagine that they have arisen. It is rather a confirmation than a real condemna­ tion of Judge Boyd in this latest case that the Exec­ utive Council of the A. F. L. promptly makes an at­ tack upon it, as not only wrong in itself but as “ an­ other instance of the usurpation of the functions of the executive and legislative branches of our Gov­ ernment by the courts.” It is correct, as this fulmination says, that the Constitution does not in any terms empower the judiciary to declare a bill un­ constitutional. Of course not; but we must once more point out that any law must be interpreted before it can be executed, and either the executingofficer or the court under which he is acting must do the interpreting. The custom, arisen out of neces­ sity, under which the jury is to pass upon the credi­ bility and value of testimony and thus of the facts in the case at bar and the judge is to interpret and explain the law, is as old as the right and custom of trial by jury. But, it is said, every bill passed is to be presumed constitutional. It is, and every court in the land gives that presumption, and so regularly and firmly that courts have erred far more often in sustaining than in condemning doubt­ ful pieces of legislation. A bill may be unconstitu­ tional through one or both of two defects: that it has not been enacted in the manner strictly laid down by the Constitution (Federal or Statel, or A ug. 27 15)21.] THE C H R O N IC L E that it contravenes some portion of the Constitution. There have been so many examples of one or the other of these fatal defects that citing any is not needful. A bill not passed as the Constitution pro­ vides is necessarily dead—it never had life; sup­ pose, for one example, that a quorum was not in the legislative hall when the vote was taken. Or sup­ pose it says that something shall be done which the Constitution says shall never be done. In either of these cases, which shall prevail, the bill or the Con­ stitution? And if the bill is to be accepted and en­ forced, without inquiry and test, then the Constitu­ tion has been virtually changed by a casual enact­ ment, which is apparently as the reckless agitator of to-day would like. Nor need there be any fear lest any constitution can obstruct reforming; none can even prevent de­ forming. The utmost power of any written consti­ tution is a temporary veto; like the executive veto, it may check the impulse of the hour, but it cannot fend off the people from any folly which severely seizes them. When socialism gets so far into com­ munism that the overwhelming majority decide, for example, that no person ought to or shall own more than say $100,000 during his life, and that all prop­ erty left by a decedent shall at once revert to the State, the thing will be put into a constitution (as still the predominating law) and then it will be left to work out its own results. Do not forget that constitutions are merely man-made statutes, a little more slowly and deliberately made, yet capable of being the dicta of madness and of directly attacking the foundations of human society. PENNSYLVANIA^BAILR~OAD~APPEALS FROM LABOR BOARD REGARDING NATIONAL AGREEMENTS. The Pennsylvania has filed a formal application with the Railway Labor Board, asking the latter to set aside and vacate its recent ruling in the matter of the men in the shop crafts, and has squarely de­ nied the legality and justice of the Board’s inter­ vention in that matter. The road renews its objec­ tions to the jurisdiction claimed; declares that the former “national agreements” are terminated and void as to itself and its employees; denies the Board’s power to prescribe an election or any other method by which the carrier may discover who are the authorized representatives of its men; denies the Board’s power to compel a conference or to pre­ scribe with what representatives of its employees it shall confer; and denies the correctness of the Board’s allegation that the question involved “ is merely one of procedure” and does not extend to the issue of closed or open shop or any other “ real mat­ ter of principle.” If the case is merely one of procedure, the road submits that the Board has neither power nor right “ to set up its judgment or opinion against that of the carrier.” It contends that mere dissatisfactions of employees should not be tortured into a “ dispute” within the meaning of Sections 301 and 307 of the Transportation Act. A reference to those sections supplies a ready test of the carrier’s contention. Section 301 declares it “ the duty of all carriers and their officers, employees and agents to exert every reasonable effort and adopt every available means to avoid any interruption to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the car­ rier and the employees or subordinate officials thereof.” In order to avoid “ interruption of opera­ 893 tion,” the section provides that “all such disputes” shall be disposed of, if possible, in conference “ be­ tween representatives designated and authorized by the carriers, or the employees, or subordinate offi­ cers thereof, directly interested in the dispute.” If any dispute is not so decided, then if shall be re­ ferred to the Board. Section 307 carries the subject to its next and last step by providing that the Board shall hear and dispose of “ any dispute involving grievances, rules, or working conditions,” in respect to which any Adjustment Board has failed or will fail to reach a decision within a reasonable time, or in respect to which the Labor Board determines that any Adjustment Board has failed in considera­ tion or is wanting in due diligence. The Adjustment Board is an instrumentality which “ may be estab­ lished” (Section 302) “ by agreement between any carrier, any group of carriers, or the carriers as a whole, and any employees or subordinate officials of carriers, or organization or group of organiza­ tions thereof.” Mr. Rea cites these sections without quoting them, but they seem clearly to sustain his contention that the “disputes” covered in them are only such as might interrupt operation and that only those are “ of substance and real moment.” The Act, he says, comprehended such matters as “ reduction of wages, real grievances, working rules and conditions,” for only these are prolific of disputes perhaps equal to interrupting transportation. Upon this ground Mr. Rea seems to stand firmly. So he denies the right and power of the Board “ to prescribe principles which must in law govern the carrier and its employees in the making of agree­ ments covering working rules and conditions” ; not­ withstanding, the carrier has sought in treating with its employees to adopt and observe such of the said principles as are fundamentally sound and correct. The results of the working of any proposition are the best test of its correctness and justice. There are now, says Mr. Rea, about 176,000 employees of the road who are interested in and touched by the rules on working conditions; of these 117,176 (66.5%) have by vote or otherwise, as a result of conferences, expressed a desire to negotiate all such matters through employee representatives. And since the Board’s decision the road has held confer­ ences with representatives of the several crafts, and they have declared their satisfaction with both the manner of selecting representatives and with the rules and working conditions embodied in said agreements. So Mr. Rea represents that the rights of any em­ ployees who are not parties to these contracts and. do not wish to be bound thereby are not impaired, as they can appeal to the Board at any time. He protests that voiding existing contracts, in compli­ ance with the Board’s decision, would cause “ great and irreparable injury of the carrier and its em­ ployees, parties to the said contracts” ; and he asks the Board to vacate its order and to grant the car­ rier an oral hearing. Now the right of this matter is a question of great and far-reaching consequence, and to the “ Chroni­ cle” the carrier seems to be wholly on the ground of justice and of sound economy. In the first place, the clear and avowed object of the Act of 18 months ago was to return the roads to their owners, and, in so doing to make the best (which necessarily means, the minimum) provisions for intervention; the old S94 THE CHRONICLE control was to be withdrawn, the properties were to be rehabilitated, by paying their just demands and otherwise, and everything was to be done which wouid (in the language that might be chosen by the advocates of the irreducible minimum of freedom) give private ownership a fair field. This means, and could mean, nothing less than the very mildest and the least frequent touches of the Governmental hand; disputes which might lead to interruption of traffic were to be disposed of by the Labor Board, but only if and when all efforts by and between the parties concerned in them had failed. This covers matters of fundamental principle, and excludes \"mere procedure” ; the thing contemplated is a disi pute over real substance, not of form. Now then, when the Board rushes in, as it seems to the “ Chronicle” to have done, prematurely and without good cause or conferred authority, the re­ sult is bad in three ways: the getting-together which is ne"
