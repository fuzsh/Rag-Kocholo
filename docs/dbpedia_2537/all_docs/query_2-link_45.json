Tho\n\ndifferent camp rumors concerning assaults by volunteer\n\nforces and gsncral attacks have all proved without foundation.\n\nWe are steadily advancing our first parallel,\n\nwhich completely encircles the outer line of rebel breastworks,\n\nand our skirmishers are now posted behind rifle\n\npits, within a distance of lees than twenty yfcrds <-t the\n\nrebel intrenebments, and nightly we have ekirmisbea\n\nwith the enemy, bet thus far without any de\n\nfinite result. Probably tho most Important feature of\n\nour steady progress since lust Sunday'* fight, is the\n\nerection of battery So. 7, upon which is to bo mounted\n\ntwelve thirty-two pound rifled guns, which will completely\n\ncommand the entire lips of the enemy's river\n\nbatteries! ^BatJeryUo. 7m wtltin the lines of Gene\n\nral D wight's command, and may be considered erected\n\non tbe extreme left of our position.

When we shell heve completed this battery we\n\nwill Tor the first time be sbls to bring to bear heavy guns\n\nupon the inner rebel fortifications. Upon tha citadel referred\n\nto the rebels have mounted the heaviest ordnance\n\nws have yet suffered from daring the siege of\n\nPort Hudson. Tbey bad on this work a one bandred\n\nand twenty pounder rifled gun, which did\n\nthe only damage to the lran-olad Esses she has yet\n\nreceived. One shot fired from this piece pierced the\n\nheavy plating of tbs Esses, and determined the danger\n\nbe would experience In endeavoring to ran promiscuous\n\nly up and down the river, as it wee at first thought abe\n\ncould do, between the two wings of our army. At flret\n\nthere was some fault in the construction of battery No. T,\n\nend we were unable to use our guns with offset upon Ibe\n\nenemy's water better lea. WhUee change in tboembnt\n\nurea was beieg mode two thirty-two pounder rifled pieces\n\nwere taken from the work end planted on e slight rise\n\nof ground, end after a few ahoto succeeded in dismounting\n\nthe large rebel piece that bad been so annoying\n\nto us. The citadel referred to will be, wbea our\n\narrangements are completed, within immediate\n\nrange of our gune, and we expect soon to l>e able to reduce\n\nthis formidable rebel fortifloatluo. Although wo\n\nhave net yet gained a position from which we can\n\nexactly determine the strength of this boasted rebel\n\n?trongtv.ii. still, from information we have received from\n\nwhat ive consider lo b > reliable sources, the enemy intend\n\nto mahe tbeir last desperate stand at this point. Ibe\n\ncitadel, although frequently spoken or, hen never been\n\naccurately described, from the Kimple fact that we hare\n\nno correct information concerning it. 1 can say, from my\n\nown obeervatiODa, that it is a large rectangular work,\n\nbuilt in the nature of a fort, upon which are mounted a\n\nnumber or pivot guns which commend every possible approach\n\nto it.\n\nI think there is no impropriety in saying tbat the for\n\nmotion or voluntoer storming parties hee been\n\neucouraged at headquarter*.

Our batteries are\n\net work night and day, from afloat as we\", as ashore, and\n\ndcsei ters are coming over nightly and giving themselves\n\nup to our pickets. 1 bene deserters are principally f om\n\nLouisiana and Tennessee regiments, and they say that\n\nthe Atkaneas and Alabuma men not OQly will not\n\ndesert, tub persuade the others to remain. Thsy\n\naleo ray that their last ration consisted of two oars of\n\ncorn oa the cob and a small piece of fteah moat. A\n\nfew days since, under a flag of truce, a rebel major stated\n\nto one of our officers that It was impossible to carry tbe\n\nplaco by asrault, but they could not much longer exist\n\nou the food they were then receiving. Everything goes\n\nto show thit General Gardner is determined to defend bis\n\nposition to the last, and will only surrender when hunger\n\ncompels him to. He feels confident that his works arc\n\nall but impregnable, and that his force is fully suffioisnt\n\nto hold at bay or repulse any assault that may be made\n\nupon his defences. He also hopes that Johnston or Buck\n\nner win come to nip rutei in lime, ana ne iteepe up tne\n\ngarrison to a fighting point by rcpreeenting that reinforcements\n\narc within a few hoars' march,and that wh.n\n\nthey arrive the siege will be raised. This is the statement\n\nof deserters, And too much confidence must not be\n\nplaced in their assertions; they do not look as if they had\n\nseen much fatigue or had suffered from want of food, for\n\na more hearty and tlno looking set of men I have seldom\n\nmot with. We hear that another attempt is to be made\n\nto-morrow to carry the works, and if successful the\n\ns'aughtor will necessarily be fearful, for tbe defence wilt\n\nbe or tbe most desperate and determined character. I\n\nhave no a for iho result if once we are able to obtain a\n\nflriufo hoi ,fii the support will be so t irong that resistance\n\nwi i cioss. If wo are defeated and driven buck\n\na long Is* i It .led and wounded will be added to those of\n\nthe two loi'uior nesauits, and we shall be compelled to try\n\nthe siege guns once more and with renewed vigor, and\n\ndepend entirely upon annoyance and starvation to do the\n\nwork and compel a surrender.\n\nTho mystery that hangs ovc-r the movements of Johnston\n\nand the uncertainty as to his whereabouts {fad me\n\nto fear that he may turn up in a most unexpected man\n\nner. Buckncr and Breckinridge have a large force at\n\nand above Mobile, and, feeling scioro at those points\n\nfrom an attack in any other direction, they may form a\n\nJunction witu Johnston and march to tho roller of Port\n\nHudson Johnston knows very well that he can do\n\nnothing against General Grant. Consequently he wiM use\n\nevery energy?and ho Is an energetic man?to assail\n\nGeneral Banks in the rear, and not only raise tbe siege,\n\nbut defeat him if possible, and cut off bis retreat u|>en\n\nRaton Rouge or Springfield landing I am confident that\n\nsome such programme is being planned by the rebel\n\ngooerale.ADd they may even now be attempting to carry\n\nit out; for the pleased expression on the faces of tbe rebels\n\nof New Orleans gives the most positive proof\n\nof some movement of their forces against us that they\n\nhope will bo a great success. 1 will halloo no more until\n\nwe are fairly out of tbe woods, which 1 think we are very\n\nfar from being atathe present time in this department.\n\nWhen Port Hudson fans tfc& t will throw my cap la the\n\nair (Si malic as much if not more noise than nay one;\n\nbut until tbat event dose occur I shell keep compare\n\nlively \"mum;'' for I must coufess that at present I do not\n\nsec much to make me feel as cohfldent In our success an\n\ndo tba majority of people aroucd me. This may bf CSa'\n\niidsrsd n copperhead si sech, but \"let those laugh who\n\nwin.\" If 1 am wrong in my conjectures I will acknowledge\n\nit: but if 1 am rlfTft?and I firmly believe I am?\n\nwill tbose who now think differently acknowledge that\n\nI have had grounds for my reasoning? The next\n\ntwo weeks will work wooden in this department.\n\nIn that time the fate of the rebellion\n\nla Lonieiana will be settled, and it will be determined If\n\nwe are to have uninterrupted pomemkm of tbls State or\n\nnot wltb the fall of Port Hudson??od Its into will bo\n\ndecided in that lime. Tbo bopoo of lb* rebels will bo\n\ncrashed in tbis sect loo, and they will torn their at too I loo\n\nto protecting Mlasimippi and Southern Alabama from tbo\n\nioroada of our armp. They will endeavor to secure Mobile\n\nand bold tbo Una of tbo Jackaoa Railroad, aad may\n\nbo sb'.e to do ao during tbo aummor aeaeou Should\n\nPort Hndaoo not fall, However, wo shall bo compelled to\n\nmaintain tbo position wo occupied before General Banks\n\nopened tbo campaign, and got everything in read term\n\nonoe more for aottvo operations as aoon aa cool weather\n\nenables us to move our men with safety.\n\nThe raid that I spoke of in my letter per steamer\n\nCreole turns out to bo a much more serious atlkir (ban at\n\nfirst anticipated for not only was the Anglo American\n\nand Sykes destroyed, but tbo steamers A.

Tbo United States steamers\n\nMonoogabeia and Winona bave been engaged In Aelliog\n\nthe woods around the two places tor a few\n\nday* past : but tb* rebels are w*ll protected behind the\n\nlevee, on account of the river being so very low.

This rep rt,\n\nhowever, needs coo Or mat Km, although the moving of\n\ntroops across the river this evening gives a cob r of truth\n\nto tbo rumor. 1 bars it from lbs beet author.ty thai a\n\ntores of live tboossnd rebels are st or near Berwick f'lty,\n\noo the Atrbsfalaya river, opposite Bresbear and should\n\nthe report be true of the capture of Butte Station, vlie\n\nchances are that the email tores we bave at Bra\n\nbear\"will be eaptored and the place occupied\n\nby the enemy All these rumors and certain\n\nlie* go to coo Arm what 1 bave before stated\n\nin regard to General Magruder, with s large tores, being In\n\nthe Attakapss country.
