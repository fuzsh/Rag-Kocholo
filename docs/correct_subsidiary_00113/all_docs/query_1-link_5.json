A 30 <PAGE> 31 payment made by Orbital pursuant to this Section 8.1, shall be referred to herein as a \"Tax Indemnity Payment.\" (b) The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for, shall pay, and shall indemnify Orbital and OrbNav and hold Orbital and OrbNav harmless from any Losses resulting from, arising out of, or relating to, any Liability for any and all Taxes of the Company with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest relating to (i) any Post-Closing Tax Period and (ii) the portion of the Taxes with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest for any Straddle Period which are allocable to the period after the Closing Date, except to the extent any such Taxes described in this Section 8.1(b) would not have been incurred but for a breach referred to in Section 8.1(a)(ii). 8.2 SURVIVAL. All obligations, covenants and agreements under this Section 8 shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue until 30 days following the expiration (taking into account any waiver, extension or mitigation thereof) of the applicable statute of limitations on assessment of the relevant Tax. 8.3 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, an alleged claim for indemnification under this Section 8 (such claim, a \"Tax Claim\"), will be governed exclusively by this Section 8, together with the applicable provisions of Sections 9 and 10. 8.4 CONTESTS. (a) If any claim for Tax with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest is asserted in a Contest (as defined below) against any Tax Indemnitee that would result in the indemnification of any such Tax Indemnitee by Orbital or OrbNav pursuant to this Section 8 then the following provisions of this Section 8.4(a) will apply to the handling of such claim. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Contest\" means any audit, court proceeding or other dispute with respect to any Tax matter that affects OrbNav's Membership Interest in the Company or any other Tax Indemnitee. Unless the Purchaser has previously received written notice from Orbital and OrbNav of the existence of such Contest, the Purchaser shall give written notice to Orbital and OrbNav of the existence of any Contest relating to a Tax matter that is or may be Orbital's or OrbNav's responsibility under this Section 8 as soon as practicable after the receipt by the Purchaser of any written notice of such Contest, but in no event later than 15 days prior to the time that a written response to the written notice is required, unless such written notice is received and a written response is due in less than 15 days, in which case the Purchaser shall give written notice to Orbital and OrbNav as soon as practicable. If the Purchaser fails to comply with the foregoing sentence, Orbital or OrbNav, as the case may be, shall not be liable to the Purchaser to the extent that Orbital's or OrbNav's position is actually prejudiced as a result thereof. Orbital and OrbNav shall, at their election, have the right to represent the interests of the Company in any Contest relating to a Tax matter for which Orbital or OrbNav may be required to make a Tax Indemnity Payment, to employ counsel of Orbital's and OrbNav's choice at the expense of Orbital and OrbNav and to control the conduct of such Contest, including settlement or other disposition thereof, provided, however, that Orbital and OrbNav will keep the Purchaser informed of the progress and disposition of the Contest and no settlement or compromise of issues will be made without the Purchaser's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and provided, further, that to the extent such Contest could adversely 31 <PAGE> 32 affect the Purchaser's Tax Liability (after taking into account any required Tax Indemnity Payment), the Purchaser will have the right to control the conduct of the Contest at its expense, and in which case no settlement or compromise of issues will be made without Orbital's and OrbNav's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Purchaser shall handle any Tax Claim relating to any Tax period of the Company included in a Pre-Closing Tax Period which Orbital and OrbNav elect in writing not to control, and the Purchaser shall be entitled to defend, compromise or settle such Tax Claim in its sole discretion. (b) With respect to any Straddle Period, the Purchaser shall control, and Orbital and OrbNav, at their own expense, shall have the right to participate in, the defense and settlement of any Contest and each party shall cooperate with the other party and there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the Purchaser will keep Orbital and OrbNav informed of the progress and disposition of the Contest and provided, further, that to the extent such Contest could adversely affect Orbital's or OrbNav's Tax Liability (after taking into account any required Tax Indemnity Payment), Orbital and/or OrbNav will have the right to participate in the conduct of the Contest, and no settlement or compromise of issues will be made without Orbital's and OrbNav's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. (c) With respect to any Tax Claim in a Contest against any Tax Indemnitee that would result in the indemnification of Orbital or OrbNav by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(b), then the following provisions of this Section 8.4(c) will apply to the handling of such claim. Unless Orbital and OrbNav has previously received written notice from the Purchaser of the existence of such Contest, the Purchaser shall give written notice to Orbital and OrbNav of the existence of any Contest relating to a Tax matter that is or may be the Purchaser's responsibility under Section 8.1(b) as soon as practicable after the receipt by the Purchaser of any written notice of such Contest. The Purchaser shall control, defend and settle any such Contest. (d) If, after good faith negotiations, either party reasonably withholds its consent where consent is required pursuant to this Section 8.4 or the parties cannot agree to the settlement or compromise of issues under this Section 8.4, then the Tax matter requiring such consent, settlement or compromise will be referred to an independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to the parties. Such accounting firm shall furnish written notice to the parties of its resolution of any such disagreement as soon as practical, but in any event no later than 45 days after its acceptance of the matter for resolution. Any such resolution by the accounting firm will be conclusive and binding on all parties of this Agreement. All fees and expenses of the accounting firm in connection with such referral shall be shares equally by the parties affected by the matter. (e) Each party shall, at no cost to the other party, cooperate with the other party hereto and the other's Representatives in a prompt and timely manner in connection with any Contest. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, making available to the other party, during normal business hours, all books, records, returns, documents, files, other information (including, without limitation, working papers and schedules), officers or employees 32 <PAGE> 33 (without substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant information necessary or useful in connection with any Contest requiring any such books, records and files. 8.5 ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing, Orbital, OrbNav, and the Purchaser shall cooperate (and cause their Affiliates and agents to cooperate) with each other and with each other's Representatives in connection with Tax matters relating to the Company, including (i) providing the basis of the Company in its assets as of December 31, 2000, (ii) preparation and filing of Tax Returns with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest, (iii) determining the liability and amount of any Taxes due with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest, the right to and amount of any refund of Taxes with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest, and the liability and amount of any Tax benefit payments with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest, and (iv) any administrative or judicial proceeding in respect of Taxes assessed or proposed to be assessed. Each party shall (i) retain all Tax Returns with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest, schedules and work papers, and all material records and other documents relating thereto, until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including, to the extent notified by any party, any extensions thereof) of the Tax period to which such Tax Returns and other documents and information relate or until the final determination of any controversy with respect to such Tax period and until the final determination of any payments that may be required with respect to such Tax period under this Agreement and (ii) give the other parties reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such Tax Returns, records and documents and, if the other parties so request, (x) the Purchaser or (y) Orbital or OrbNav, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such Tax Returns, records and documents. Each of the parties shall also make available to the other parties, as reasonably requested and to the extent available, personnel (including officers, directors, employees and agents) responsible for preparing, maintaining, and interpreting information and providing information or documents in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes with respect to OrbNav's Membership Interest. 8.6 TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. Any Tax sharing agreement, Tax allocation agreement or Tax indemnification agreement between (x) Orbital or OrbNav and (y) the Company is terminated as of the Closing Date and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year, or a past year), and nothing shall be paid in respect of any amounts owing under such agreements as of such date and all rights and obligations of the Company with respect to Taxes shall be as provided herein. 8.7 TREATMENT OF TAX INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. The parties, (x) the Purchaser and (y) Orbital or OrbNav, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, treat any payments made pursuant to this Section 8 as adjustments to the purchase price. To the extent that any such payment is not permitted to be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price, the amount of such payment shall be increased by the amount of any actual additional Tax cost incurred as a result of the receipt of such payment. Any Tax benefit actually received by the recipient of such payment as a result of its payment of the Tax to which such indemnity payment relates shall either reduce the amount of such indemnity payment or otherwise be paid by the recipient to the payor of such indemnity. 33 <PAGE> 34 8.8 TAX RETURNS. The Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and filing (or shall be responsible for causing the preparing and filing) all necessary foreign, federal, state and local income tax returns for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2001. No later than June 15, 2002, the Purchaser shall prepare and mail (or cause to be prepared and mailed) to Orbital and OrbNav Form 1065 (Schedule K-1) with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. SECTION 9. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. 9.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS. The representations, warranties and covenants contained herein shall survive the Closing Date for a period of (and claims based upon or arising out of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements may be asserted at any time before the date which shall be) three (3) years after the Closing Date; provided that the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in Section 3.19 shall survive until thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). No investigation or waiver made by any of the parties hereto shall in any way limit the representations and warranties of the parties. The termination of the representations and warranties provided herein shall not affect the rights of a party in respect of any claim made by such party in a writing received on a timely basis by the other party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period provided herein. 9.2 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) General Indemnity by Orbital and OrbNav. Orbital and OrbNav shall indemnify, save and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and all Losses, incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Orbital or OrbNav in this Agreement or (ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made by Orbital or OrbNav in this Agreement. The term \"Losses\" is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against an Indemnified Party (as hereinafter defined), but includes Losses incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Party in the absence of third party claims. Payments by an Indemnified Party of amounts for which it is indemnified hereunder shall not be a condition precedent to recovery. (b) General Indemnity By the Purchaser. The Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless Orbital and OrbNav from and against any and all Losses arising out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, made by the Purchaser in this Agreement; and (ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made by the Purchaser in this Agreement. (c) Procedure for Making Claims between Parties. If a claim (a \"Claim\") for Losses is to be made by any party seeking indemnification (each an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\"), such Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the 34 <PAGE> 35 \"Claim Notice\") to any party from whom such indemnification may be sought (each an \"Indemnifying Party\" and collectively, the \"Indemnifying Parties\"), as soon as practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 9.2. Failure to submit any such notice of claim to any Indemnifying Party shall not relieve such Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted the Claim Notice and to have agreed to pay the Losses at issue if such Indemnifying Party does not send a notice of dispute to the Indemnified Party within forty-five (45) calendar days after receiving the Claim Notice, and in such case payment procedures shall be as set forth in Section 9.2(c)(ii) below. In the case of a disputed Claim, the parties shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 9.2(c)(i) below.
