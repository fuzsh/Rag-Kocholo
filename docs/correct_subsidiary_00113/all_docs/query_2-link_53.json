        "text": "A Relentless Quest for Maps\n\nLadies and gentleman, come with me and prepare to rewind your clocks: I want to take you back to the year 1967. This was the year that the Beatles released Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rupert Murdoch got married for only the second time. It was also the year that marked the formation of a tiny new organization — an organization that became one ingredient in a momentous Map Happening.\n\nLet me recount the story.\n\nAt that time there existed a large and successful company in Chicago by the name of R.R. Donnelley. Originally founded in 1864 by its namesake, Richard Robert Donnelley, R.R. Donnelley became a global printing behemoth. By 1967 it had become famous for printing the first telephone directories (in 1874!), the marketing material for the Ford Model-T, the Sears Catalog and LIFE Magazine.\n\nTo support its printing empire Donnelley had purchased a number of large and very expensive color printing presses and they were always looking for ways to recoup their investment. The company was already printing tons of phone books and magazines but it still had capacity on its presses going to waste. So what did it do? Donnelly made a proposition to the oil companies to create and print road maps. One of those companies was Shell Oil.\n\nAt the time Shell already had a large network of stations across the US and Donnelley thought they could give them an edge. The pitch went something like this:\n\n“How about we design and print some beautiful road maps on our super high quality presses and you give them away at your gas stations as a promotional product?”\n\nThe offering was well received. But it didn’t stop there. Pretty soon Donnelley was producing all manor of custom maps for travel publications, for text books, for encyclopedias and for atlases. The business became big enough that in 1967 Donnelley formed a new division: Donnelley Cartographic Services.\n\n1967: Donnelley Cartographic Services\n\nDonnelley wanted this new organization to be close to one of its printing plants, so it got headquartered in the glorious city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Lancaster is in a mostly rural area populated by the Amish and has been made famous by one of Peter Weir‘s most successful films (well worth a watch BTW):\n\nAs the years progressed Donnelley Cartographic Services became the biggest custom mapping organization on the planet.\n\nBut in 1990 along came another opportunity.\n\nA small software startup in McClean, Virginia needed some state highway maps as well as some funding for a trip planning product it was hoping to develop. That company was Spatial Data Sciences (SDS) and was headed by one Dr. Barry Glick. SDS pitched both Rand McNally and Donnelley on the concept. Rand didn’t bite but Donnelley did. The project started as a joint venture but only a year later Donnelley decided to take full control and buy out SDS’s share. Donnelley was now firmly in the mapping software business.\n\nBut just four years later, in 1994, Donnelley decided to refocus on its printing business. Glick and others convinced management that the organization could be grown much more quickly as an independent company with VC funding. As a result the cartographic services division and the recently formed geospatial software division was spun off, birthing an entirely new organization: GeoSystems Global Corporation. Glick was named the founding CEO.\n\n1994: GeoSystems Global Corporation\n\nGeoSystems was a pioneer. It developed interactive mapping applications for the first generation of electronic yellow pages, travel guides, CD-ROM based street atlas products, driving direction kiosks for car rental companies and web sites for real estate organizations. Its list of clients was impressive:\n\nNearly all of the largest US phone companies — NYNEX, Bell South, Bell Atlantic, Ameritech and Pacific Bell\n\nMany of the largest automobile associations: AAA in the US and the Automobile Association (AA) in the UK\n\nHertz and later AVIS\n\nMoore Real Estate: with GeoSystems’ expertise Moore became the most innovative player in the US real estate market with their launch of the world’s first website for home search: CyberHomes.com\n\nGeoSystems even had Apple as a customer: GeoSystems developed the Fodor’s 94 Travel Manager for the Apple Newton and Apple published it as part of a suite of apps.\n\nBut let’s all remember what times were like in those days …\n\nI realize many a reader will be a young whippersnapper whose brain is unaccustomed to being deprived of a Wi-Fi enabled screen. But even if you’re an old crinkly like me your brain may still need a Biden prompt to remember what life was like.\n\nBy now we’re in the year 1995 when America Online (AOL) was all the rage and the most popular web sites were the likes of Yahoo!, GeoCities, Netscape:\n\nThe Moon Shot Idea\n\nSo the bright minds at GeoSystems made note of all of this hype and decided to go for a moon shot: what if they developed a consumer website focused on mapping and funded it through advertising?\n\nBut the question was: what to call it? The original idea for a name was “webmapper”, but a company in the website management business trademarked the name just before the planned launch. A frantic internal competition ensued to come up with a new name. The winning name was nailed by an employee’s wife .\n\nIt’s a name some of you may of heard of. It was:\n\nYes, dear reader, MapQuest.\n\nAnd so on February 5, 1996 the site was launched. It looked something like this :\n\nQ: so what happened after the launch? A: all hell broke loose.\n\nRemember where the company was located: Lancaster, Pennsylvania. A town with a population of about 50,000 and most famous for the Amish, who eschew modern things like electricity and who still use horse and buggies instead of cars:\n\nIt ain’t exactly the Valley.\n\nWord about MapQuest spread quickly on the social media conduits of the day (i.e. people talked to each other). Within a few days traffic to the site skyrocketed and there was a mad, crazy scramble to add more capacity. One of the larger rooms in the office rapidly became swamped with folding tables, stacked servers and a rat’s nest of cables.\n\nAnd then Lancaster’s entire internet capacity was mostly sucked into serving MapQuest. The team did everything it could to keep the site up.\n\nAnd this was all with just a very basic product at launch: MapQuest didn’t even provide directions. It only did one thing: it rendered a static map for an address — and only if that address was in the US.\n\nThings moved rapidly from there:\n\nGeoSystems opened an office in Denver and relocated MapQuest servers there\n\nMapQuest launched turn-by-turn directions for the US, resulting in another huge bump in traffic\n\nMapQuest launched B2B offerings — so businesses could embed MapQuest maps & directions in their own site\n\nMapQuest expanded internationally, providing coverage in Canada and western Europe\n\nThe site became so popular it was rare not to see someone carrying their MapQuest printout when boarding a plane:\n\nEven cartoonists of the day picked up on MapQuest’s popularity:\n\nA year after launch things moved at an even more rapid pace. In July 1997 raised $12M in a Series C and in 1998 a few of the founding members of MapQuest left for other endeavors. The most impactful change came in August 1998 when Mike Mulligan, formally a senior VP at American Express, was installed as CEO.\n\nThen things started moving at warp speed.\n\nBy the late 1990s the ‘dot com’ boom was in full swing. Everyone was anxious to ride the wave. In 1995 Netscape had gone public. Then in 1996 so did Yahoo. In 1997 it was Amazon. 1998 saw IPOs from the likes of GeoCities, InfoSpace & Inktomi. But by 1998 there were already murmurings of a possible dot-com bubble burst, so time was of the essence.\n\nSo Mulligan quickly took the company down a path to an IPO.\n\nMay 1999: The IPO\n\nThe company knew it wasn’t going to get the valuation it needed with the name “GeoSystems Global Corporation”. It had to leverage the mindshare the MapQuest brand had achieved. Originally the thought was simply to rename the company MapQuest. But at the time companies were doing everything they could to leverage their internet prowess. By simply adding “.com” to your name you could get a huge lift in value (sound familiar?) — so that made the decision easy. In February 1999 GeoSystems Global Corporation became MapQuest.com, Inc.\n\nMulligan also knew a leading ‘dot com’ headquartered in sleepy Lancaster, PA wasn’t going to cut it. Instead the HQ was quickly relocated to a swanky office on Park Avenue in Manhattan.\n\nBy January 1999 MapQuest had grown to 222 employees (46 in sales!) and had an impressive list of customers, including:\n\nYahoo! (MapQuest powered Yahoo!Maps)\n\nOther search engines of the time: Excite, Infoseek, Lycos, Ask Jeeves\n\nElon Musk’s Zip2\n\nAAA, Avis, Hertz, Budget\n\nTravelocity, American Express, Galileo\n\nNational Geographic\n\nFedEx, Blockbuster, Borders, Home Depot, Sears\n\nMarriott, Hilton\n\nTicketmaster\n\nRevenues were ~$25M but at the time only about 30% (or ~$8M) was coming from MapQuest’s internet business, i.e. advertising on the MapQuest site and MapQuest B2B web services. The rest was coming from the legacy custom print map business, formerly Donnelley Cartographic Services. Of course the pitch to investors was the growth potential of the internet business was going to far outpace the legacy business.\n\nWhen discussing potential valuations I remember the internal discussions well. Very conservatively we thought the company was worth $40M. If we were hugely optimistic and MapQuest hit a home run the company might be worth $400M.\n\nMapQuest went public on May 4, 1999 and the stock popped 49% on the first day. This company, with about $8M in internet related revenue, was now worth $800M.\n\nBut that promise to investors about the potential growth of the internet business was not a pipe dream. By the end of 1999 MapQuest had about 2,500 customers. Many of those were businesses that just wanted a store locator on their web site. The big sites like Yahoo! used MapQuest to add maps to their search results and to power their own map offerings.\n\nFor advertising revenue MapQuest had an edge: it could drive the value of an ad in a way nobody else could: MapQuest knew where you were going. So MapQuest was the first site to offer ‘geocentric’ ads. Hotels, airlines and fast food chains loved it.\n\nIn the months following the IPO MapQuest continued to soar and expand. MapQuest now offered its services in five languages and 78 countries and became the first mapping website to offer satellite imagery. It was by far the most popular mapping site on the web — in November 1998 Media Metrix had ranked MapQuest as the 34th most visited web site in the world and MapQuest was the number one travel web site. It also won awards from PC Magazine and Yahoo!Internet Life.\n\nA Potential Acquisition Target\n\nAll this hype and activity started to attract the attention of the big boys. Having just suffered going through the due diligence of an IPO, MapQuest was now a ‘cleaner’ company and therefore easier to acquire.\n\nOne of the companies MapQuest was courting at the time was America Online (AOL). MapQuest was hoping to ‘map enable’ AOL’s many properties. By then AOL was at its zenith. It had bought its largest competitor, CompuServe. It had bought the popular instant messaging site ICQ. And it had bought Netscape. And it was hungry to continue its expansion. AOL was particularly interested in gaining access to large volumes of web pages where it could place local advertising.\n\nShortly after MapQuest went public, Mike Mulligan overheard his assistant trying to arrange a meeting between him and Paul DeBenedictis of AOL. DeBenedictis was head of AOL Digital Cities, a site that provided local content and event information for cities across the US. Paul was in the process of identifying companies that could provide AOL with a substantial amount of local advertising inventory.\n\nMike interrupted his assistant and asked to speak to Paul directly. They quickly managed to agree on a much earlier meeting date. It was lucky for MapQuest that they did. In the meeting with Paul, it turned out AOL had just started to think about acquisition candidates to add traffic to their AOL Digital Cities effort. With a favorable meeting early in the process MapQuest got to the head of the queue for acquisition discussions. Had the meeting not happened so early it may have been a different story.\n\nTruth be told, AOL’s interest in MapQuest wasn’t really about the maps. They also didn’t care about MapQuest’s B2B business. They just wanted one thing: ad inventory.\n\nBut even with this lucky break the deal almost didn’t happen.\n\nThe potential acquisition went south in due diligence. AOL wasn’t happy with MapQuest’s data contract with NavTech (now HERE). They decided to pause discussion and asked MapQuest’s permission to conduct contract discussions directly with NavTech. MapQuest consented. They negotiated a new deal with NavTech and came back months later to renew acquisition discussions. By this time MapQuest’s stock price had risen and MapQuest ended up with a substantially more favorable deal as a result.\n\nConcurrent with the MapQuest acquisition discussions, AOL was pursuing a different and much bigger mega-acquisition: Time Warner. But it wasn’t long before the Time Warner negotiations broke down. It was during this lull that the Mapquest deal was brought back to the table and was subsequently approved by the AOL Board.\n\nHad the Time Warner deal not fallen off the MapQuest acquisition would probably never have been considered.\n\nDecember 1999: Acquisition Announced\n\nFinally on 22 December 1999 the deal was announced. AOL agreed to purchase MapQuest in a stock deal that was worth about $1.1B. Not bad for a company that at the time had revenues of around $35M.\n\nBut that valuation didn’t last long. AOL’s stock had peaked about 10 days earlier. Less than a month later, on 10 January 2000, AOL announced its much more outrageous acquisition: it was going to buy Time Warner for $183,000,000,000 (yes, that’s 183 with a ‘B’). But within a day of the announcement AOL’s shares tanked 11%, taking the value of the still-to-close MapQuest acquisition with it. By 18 January 2000 the value of MapQuest deal had shrunk to about $785 million.\n\nMany MapQuest employees weren’t happy about AOL, particularly those who’d put their hearts and all their energy into developing the internet side of the business. The idea of being acquired by AOL was abhorrent. To them it would almost have been like being acquired by an organization like DJT today. AOL? They don’t understand the internet! All they did was fill your mailbox with AOL CDs.\n\nBut eventually the deal closed in the second quarter of 2000. MapQuest was now the property of Big, Bad AOL.\n\n2000: The Slow Demise Post Acquisition\n\nAt first things looked pretty rosy. AOL had a humungous amount of users. At that time four in every five Americans on the web touched an AOL property. And AOL was able to direct a ton more users to MapQuest. Traffic went further through the roof. So AOL got what it wanted: a huge number of page views on which to display ads.\n\nBut soon there were signs that utopia was going to be elusive.\n\nOn January 11, 2001 AOL’s acquisition of Time Warner closed, one year after the deal was announced. Civil war between AOL and Time Warner executives quickly broke out. A day after the close AOL stock traded at $47.45 — down from an all time high of $94.19 on 15 December 1999.\n\nThings were not looking good. A company-wide hiring freeze was implemented, affecting AOL Time Warner and all its properties, including MapQuest.\n\nBy this time yours truly had a new manager as Mike Mulligan had helicoptered into the sunset. In fact I had several managers within the first year post acquisition — actually seven — yes — seven. I had been told: if you want to advance your career you should relocate to AOL’s HQ in Dulles, Virginia. ‘Yes, sir’ I said. Then, the night before I was due to move my family from Lancaster to Virginia, I got a call from my then boss: AOL was going to close the MapQuest office in Lancaster the next day and lay off all staff. 😱\n\nI relocated the next day as planned, arriving at the new house with the movers and all the moving boxes. Out of the blue I get another call from an executive assistant to a senior AOL VP. She gave me a somewhat disturbing message: “Err, you know we’ve just had a big re-org and I know you’ve just moved your house and family to Virginia, but we don’t know what your role will be or who your next boss will be. But please don’t worry.” 😱😱\n\nHmm. Very encouraging.\n\nThe new management seemed to have very little interest in anything to do with MapQuest, particularly as it related to product road map and strategy. And with the layoffs and hiring freeze there weren’t enough resources to do anything substantial even if there was a good plan.\n\nI tried to make matters clear and pleaded with the powers that be: MapQuest was a site built on map data but it didn’t make maps. In fact 98% of the map data was licensed from third parties I knew MapQuest had to build a moat around the product otherwise someone else could swoop in, license the same data and build a better product.\n\nAnd you won’t win any prizes for guessing who did.\n\nOn 8 February 2005 a new site launched. Unlike MapQuest it had big ‘slippy’ maps — maps that you could pan just by clicking and dragging. It also had a brand:\n\nGoogle.\n\nI think you’ll agree: the rest is history.\n\nMapQuest Today\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, it still exists.\n\nIt’s now owned by System1, an internet advertising company. All of MapQuest’s IP and mapping know how has been pretty much discarded. It now seems to rely mostly on technology from Mapbox.\n\nWhat a sad way to have to end a story about a truly great company.\n\nBut it truly was a ‘Map Happening’ that rocked our world.\n\nReferences, Acknowledgments, Further Reading and Viewing:\n\nMany thanks to Perry Evans, Barry Glick, Mike Mulligan, Michael Nappi and Paul Ross, without whom the juicy details of this post would not have been possible.\n\nSecurity and Exchange Commission: S-1 prospectus for MapQuest IPO.\n\nChicagology: RR Donnelley: a short history on how R.R.

It’s because I’ve been preoccupied with other matters — and one in particular: a grand tour of Great Britain, encompassing a few of the most iconic locations in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nThis was a three week road trip with a different stop practically every night.\n\nThe process of planning the trip proved to be long and arduous, but actually a lot of fun. It involved tons of research into places to visit, the best places to stay and eat and the best routes to get from A to B. The tools and information sources I used were varied and while they enabled me to build a plan, it wasn’t particularly straightforward. But I got there in the end.\n\nNow that I’m back I’d like to share the memories of the trip. However, like the trip planning, building and sharing a coherent résumé of my journey is far from straightforward — actually in many ways it sucks.\n\nNet/net: nobody has cracked the trip planning nut and nobody has cracked the trip memories nut.\n\nSo if you’re a passionate mapping nerd with some developer chops here’s your challenge and opportunity: build a seriously magical product for travel that becomes the go-to default for planning, organizing and reliving a trip.\n\nI’ll recount my experience below so you can use it as one set of data points. Take your own experiences as another set of data points. Talk to your family and friends about how they’ve planned trips and shared memories. Then be ruthless and question every requirement. Boil everything down to the very essence of what people actually need. And be sure to weave in design wizardry from the get-go to make the product insanely easy and a delight to use.\n\nI’ll bet you a dollar: you’ll have a winner on your hands.\n\nLet’s Start with The Planning\n\nWhere do you start? In my case I had some ideas and some parameters. There were certain places I knew I wanted to visit and a few places I knew I wanted to stay. The trip was time bound to three weeks and I knew I didn’t want to spend all day driving in a car. So the goal was fun and easy.\n\nIf you do some poking around you will discover there are some apps out there that attempt to help you build a trip plan. But they’re all pretty laborious to use.\n\nThe closest I could find to a reasonably good trip planner was Wanderlog. It’s pretty comprehensive and allows you to build an itinerary, make notes, set budgets and collaborate with others. It’s also got pretty good place search and a nice ‘mappy’ interface. And of course like any of today’s products from search engines to bananas — it’s AI enabled:\n\nBut remember, yours truly is a Jaded Mapping Curmudgeon (JMC), so would I use such a new fangled tool? Well I did try. But I was immediately faced with the uncertainty. If I were to spend copious hours investing in this tool would it give me the results I need? And would I be able to use it easily on the trip? And could I (with short arms and deep pockets) get what I wanted without having to fork out $$$ for the pro version? And, as an Apple Maps bigot, would I be forced to use Google Maps?\n\nFUD quickly consumed me. I demurred.\n\nSo what did I use? Well it boiled down to two tools with which I had extreme familiarity: Apple Maps and a spreadsheet — in my case Numbers. Let me explain the process:\n\nSimilar to Google Maps, it turns out Apple Maps has an extremely useful feature to build lists of places and add to them to collections. In Apple Maps’ case they call them ‘Guides’. Apple Maps Guides come in two forms: curated guides and then ‘My Guides’. Curated guides are lists of places put together by well know publications and there are now hundreds and hundreds of them in Apple Maps. Here’s a sample for London:\n\nBut Maps also provides an easy way to create your own guides on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Simply take a place of interest, tap the “… More” button and select “Add to Guides”. Bingo. Now you can quickly build a list of places that are relevant to your trip and add or delete items from the guide with a couple of taps:\n\nHere’s a view of the guide I created for my UK trip, complete with hotels, places I wanted to visit, attractions and even laundries:\n\nWhat was beautiful about this approach is everything I needed was immediately accessible: phone numbers, web sites, directions and by viewing the guide and zooming into a particular area I could quickly filter the list to what was relevant for a particular day. And with one tap you can share the guide with others.\n\nWhat was missing of course was all the details: arrival and departure dates, reservation numbers, booking references, costs & budgeting. Now I could have spent the energy and put all that information in the Wanderlog app, but like I said, I was wary of trusting the information to an unfamiliar app. I also found it was difficult to get the app to summarize the information in the form I was looking for. So naturally what do I do? I turn to a spreadsheet. Here’s the one I created and it provided everything I needed right at my fingertips:\n\nBecause it was cloud based it was easily accessible from any of my devices and, using the collaboration features of Numbers, easy to share and edit with others.\n\nBut how did I figure out where to stop, stay and eat? That, dear reader, is where the research started in earnest. If you’ve read any of my past posts, in particular ‘Why Rating Systems for Places & POIs Suck… and a Possible Fix‘ you’ll realize I’m not a fan of crowdsourced ratings — the main reason being that the Venn diagram of my tastes and opinions seldom overlaps with the tastes and opinions of the general masses. Also many — if not all — place ratings tend to be dominated by the opinions of septics. No offense, but when you hear stories about such people complaining vociferously about the lack of French toast in Parisian bistros it quickly makes you realize that perhaps you should take their opinions with a grain of salt.\n\nSo my research relied mostly on well respected travel publications. If you’re ever searching for places to stay in the UK I can highly recommend perusing The [London] Telegraph travel web pages. I would strongly advise you stay clear of any web site driven primarily by booking revenue and stay clear of highly popular sites (particularly US based) that claim to provide ‘travel advice’. Look for the smaller, quirkier publications. Or go by word of mouth from friends and family. I think you get the picture.\n\nPretty soon you’ll be building up a nice personal guide in your favorite mapping product. With a companion spreadsheet you’ll have what you need.\n\nYou could say that all this laborious research is part of the fun — like looking for a brilliant sale on that item you’ve always cherished. A relentless search for the perfect place provides not only the reward but also the endorphin. So, if someone made it too easy would you feel like you were making the right decisions? You be the judge.\n\nOn The Journey\n\nThe Apple Maps guide I created for the trip worked like a charm. I immediately had all the pertinent information I needed at my fingertips. And when traveling to the next destination the ‘avoid highways’ option gave me a reasonably good and lesser traveled route that was more interesting to drive.\n\nBut it did uncover my three big wishes for Apple Maps:\n\nTweaks to my guide in Apple Maps didn’t promulgate to the people I shared it with. So sharing a guide is really a ‘send a copy’ feature, not a ‘collaborate’ feature. Apple has both options for Notes, Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents. I wish they’d bring the same to Apple Maps Guides.\n\nI would have loved a ‘Scenic Route’ option for directions.\n\nIf there was one area I was longing for some ‘Apple Intelligence’ it was for suggesting places to stop along the route — perhaps for some good coffee or a site worth visiting. There were at least two occasions when we drove right past a spectacular site that we didn’t know we were going to pass.\n\nHere they are:\n\nAngel of the North\n\nThe Angel of the North is a contemporary sculpture by Antony Gormley, located just south of Newcastle, England. Completed in 1998, it is believed to be the largest sculpture of an angel in the world. It stands 20 metres (66 ft) tall with a wingspan of 54 metres (177 ft), larger than that of a Boeing 757 aircraft.\n\nThe Kelpies\n\nThe Kelpies are a pair of monumental steel horse-heads near the Scottish town of Falkirk. They were designed by sculptor Andy Scott and were completed in 2013. A kelpie, or water kelpie, is a shape-shifting spirit inhabiting lochs in Irish and Scottish folklore. It is usually described as a horse-like creature and is able to adopt human form.\n\nSharing the Memories\n\nFacebucket? Instagam? X? TikTok? MySpace? You won’t catch this JMC in that festering world. Me: I want to share different sets of photos with different sets of people — and not with the whole world thanks very much.\n\nSo along the journey I resorted to Messages, WhatsApp and an ancient appy thing Gen Z users have never heard of: “electronic-mail”. Painful? Yes. But at least I was in full control of distribution.\n\nThe trouble really started when I got back home. I had taken nearly 700 photos and they were widely geographically distributed. Furthermore, if I shared a set of pictures of a particular location, say Sterling Castle, the people I shared it with weren’t necessarily, shall we say, ‘geographically capable’. So they had no idea of place or context.\n\nFinding all the photos of a particular location is fairly easy to do in Photos on iOS or macOS: use the ‘Places’ tab and zoom into the map location of interest. You can then subselect and share the set of photos from there.\n\nIf you want to get cute: open iMovie on your iPhone, select “Start New Project” and then select ‘Magic Movie’:\n\nIt’s actually pretty awesome. Here’s a Magic Movie I created for Sterling Castle in Scotland:\n\nBut again — what’s missing from all this?\n\nErr … how about a map boys and gals?\n\nIt turns out there is no magic way to include a map. One app I tried with supposedly good ratings, Tripcast, provides a map view option on uploaded photos, but it is up to the user to select the map and there is [AFAIK] no way to recreate the journey with map animations. Also, it takes ages to upload any photos to their servers. I tried uploading all the photos I took on the trip and the app repeatedly crashed. Ugh.\n\nNow some of you Apple fanpeople may have watched the recent WWDC24 Keynote and noticed a new feature coming to the Photos app called ‘Trips’. Here’s the clip about the new Photos app coming in iOS 18:\n\nBut does the ‘Trips’ filter include a map? Alas, I don’t think so.\n\nAnd more importantly: does the ‘Trips’ feature include map animations? I seriously doubt it. If you want to recreate a journey with map animations and share it with others it’s hard. Seriously hard. You can try using StoryMaps (sorry: it’s hard and painful). If you’re a pro you can use an Adobe After Effects template like WorldTravelMaps (even harder and even more painful):\n\nAnother possible app you might want try for sharing memories is called Polarsteps. From what I can tell, Polarsteps seems to be a Facebook for trips, so you can go there to search and browse for trips other people have taken and you can use it to create a résumé of trips you may have taken yourself. It seems mountains better than Tripcast in that it will (somewhat scarily) scan your photo library and automatically build trips from that. I downloaded Polarsteps from the app store and after about 10 minutes of scanning and about another 20 minutes of poking I was able to build a rudimentary version of my GB Grand Tour:\n\nPolarsteps was about 70% successful in rebuilding the trip. However, it did hallucinate a bit when trying to associate photos with location. But, all-in-all, not too bad.\n\nI see Clare Jones, formerly of What3Words, is now CEO of Polartrips. I can’t wait to see what she does.\n\nA Possible Magical Product\n\nSo what’s the perfect app?\n\nAn app that helps me plan and collaborate effortlessly. Totally map centric. And super smart.\n\nAutomatically add details to my itinerary by mining my emails about bookings and reservations\n\nMake suggestions based on places I like and other people like me like (not just the general masses)\n\nLeverages the apps I use every day: Maps, Photos and Calendar\n\nSuggests more interesting routes especially scenic routes\n\nAnd importantly: similar to what Polarsteps attempts to do: it auto-magically allows me to recreate the journey so I can relive it when I get home: a journey with gorgeous map animations and smart clustering of the photos and videos I took along the way.\n\nApple Maps and Photos (or Google equivalents) sort of come close to solving some of the challenges. Wanderlog makes a valiant try but is still laborious and totally misses on memories. Polarsteps goes a long way to reliving a trip but lacks the capabilities of trip planing.\n\nSo what’s a possible future?\n\nPerhaps, just perhaps: some more mischievous sherlocking by that nefarious fruity company in Cupertino. I can see it now:\n\nTrips: your magical companion for any journey.\n\nFootnotes\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nApple\n\nEsri\n\nPolarsteps\n\nTripcast\n\nVisit Scotland\n\nWanderlog\n\nWikimedia\n\nWorldTravelMaps\n\nIt’s not often you come across an organization that has the potential to make a difference. I mean really make a difference. This tiny organization called ‘PLACE’ is one of them.\n\nPLACE first came across my radar when I was contacted by its founder, Peter Rabley, last July.\n\nPeter is a geographer. He was born in Southampton, England which coincidentally is not too far from the Ordnance Survey headquarters. Perhaps that was a signal that he would eventually get involved with mapping.\n\nIt turns out Peter and I share a few common threads: during the late 1970s we both suffered through a Roman Catholic boarding school education in England and we both quickly became ex-pats. Not only that: just like me Peter’s first serious involvement with technology was with VAX/VMS mini-computers. But while I fled to Silicon Valley, Peter’s journey was much more exotic.\n\nHe spent his youth growing up in the Bahamas and then ended up studying Geography at the University of Michigan. Then in 1984 he headed to the University of Miami to acquire a masters in Economic Geography and GIS. It was while he was at Miami that he got familiar with mapping technology, cutting his teeth on what must have been an excruciatingly painful and early version of Esri’s ARC/INFO.\n\nWhat? I’m calling early versions of ARC/INFO exotic? No, but wait!\n\nThe exotic part was when Peter got a job focusing on urban planning in Washington, DC. From this position he was promptly dispatched to various locales in Pakistan and Nepal. Fast forward a few years and Peter had built expertise in international land management, both from a policy point of view and in the foundational technology used to make it all work efficiently, especially in developing countries.\n\nIn 1996 Peter founded International Land Systems (ILS). ILS focused on software and services for property registration and property boundary mapping. And they did this in over 30 countries worldwide: including in China, Ukraine, Ghana and Jamaica as well as in the US, the UK and Germany.\n\nIn 2011 ILS got acquired by Thomson Reuters and within a year Peter had left to form another property information venture, this time with a philanthropic organization called the Omidyar Network. In case you’re not familiar, this organization was established by Pierre Omidyar who founded eBay.\n\nBy that time Peter had come to realize that a dire lack of information about buildings and properties was holding back urban planning. More importantly it was holding back economic growth. This was particularly the case in developing countries around the world.\n\nAt the macro level it all boiled down to one thing: a lack of detailed data about cities, communities and neighborhoods was a serious crimp on the social well being of hundreds of millions of people across whole continents.\n\nBut these countries didn’t just need software to manage data. They needed the raw data to power it. And they didn’t have it.\n\nWhat’s the best way to go about creating this data? Well, guess what folks, it all starts with a map.\n\nIt was out of this need that in January 2020 PLACE was born.\n\nPLACE Fundamentals\n\nWhen Peter founded PLACE he focused relentlessly on the fundamentals. Fundamentals about data. Fundamentals about organizational structure. Fundamentals about incentives. And perhaps most importantly — fundamentals about trust.\n\nPLACE was not just going to be another commercial mapping company. And nor was it going to be another open data organization. PLACE had to be structured in such a way that the organization could produce high quality data efficiently and in volume. This required a ‘back to first principals’ rethink of how data companies are structured, how incentives are aligned and how data is collected and published.\n\nPLACE also had to focus on producing the right kind of data. In peeling the question back to the most atomic level Peter came to realize that in order to build very detailed maps suitable for helping communities grow and prosper you first needed something even more basic: you needed imagery.\n\nBut not just any imagery. The kind you could get from commercial satellites just didn’t cut it. You needed something much more HD.\n\nSo what did PLACE set out to do?\n\nThey made it their mission to collect and publish super high resolution, high-accuracy aerial and street imagery for cities across Africa and small island countries around the world.\n\nThis imagery would be the fuel to build the maps. And the maps would be the fuel to stimulate growth and prosperity.\n\nThinking Different\n\nThe beauty of PLACE isn’t so much about the data they collect. It’s about the way they do it.\n\nFirst: PLACE gives ownership of any data collected in a country to the government of that country. At zero cost.\n\nIn return PLACE asks for three things:\n\nGetting the respective government to provide the necessary licenses and permits to collect the data\n\nGetting the right to permanently steward the data in the PLACE Trust, a legal data trust based in the UK\n\nGetting the right to license the data in the PLACE Trust to PLACE Members\n\nPLACE also pledges not to compete with its Members. So they’re not going to build street map data or a land information systems from the imagery. In a sense they’ve taken a leaf out of TSMC’s book. TSMC pledges not to complete with its customers in the silicon chip manufacturing business .\n\nAll of this aligns the incentives and builds trust.\n\nIn return for getting the data at no cost governments are incentivized to provide the necessary approvals to allow the data collection to take place. For example: permits to land and fly specific aircraft or UAVs and notices to ministries of defense, air traffic control and to the police.\n\nGetting these permits is often arduous, costly and time consuming, so incentivizing the governments to provide rapid approval is invaluable. Peter told me a story about another commercial aerial survey company that was kept waiting 110 days for their permits. Can you imagine the cost of having your plane and equipment grounded for almost 4 months? Ouch.\n\nSecond: As an organization PLACE is built on a principle of trust:\n\nGovernments are screened and vetted before any data collection agreements are signed.\n\nAny third parties want to use the data must apply to become a PLACE Member. They also get vetted and screened.\n\nTerms of Use are subject to the LOCUS Charter, which defines a set of common international principles to support ethical and responsible practice when using location data.\n\nPLACE Members and governments must abide by these principles and must remain in good standing in order to maintain access to any data in the PLACE Trust. If governments don’t abide then they can say goodbye to any ongoing or future data collection. If PLACE Members don’t abide then they can say goodbye to data access.\n\nThe data is collected by one arm of the PLACE organization called the PLACE Foundation, based in the USA. But the data is stewarded and licensed by a completely different legal entity called the PLACE Trust, based in the UK. In that way the data can continue to be properly protected even in the event of failure of the PLACE Foundation.\n\nThird: The focus is on collecting data the right way, but done fast.\n\nPLACE isn’t just collecting data using a few cheap DJI drones. They focus on photogrammetric rigor using the latest LiDAR and UltraCam aerial cameras. Mounted in Lear jets or Event 38 mapping drones, data can be collected at a rate of up to 5,000 square kilometers per hour.\n\nPLACE’s framework is already proving its value:\n\nIn three short years (mostly during the global pandemic) PLACE is quickly gaining traction. They’ve signed agreements with nine countries including Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Turks and Caicos, Anguilla, Malawi and Kenya. Nigeria, with a population of 230 million, is the latest large country to join.\n\nThey’re finding that the PLACE framework is disintermediating data collection and eliminating the need for consultants to get the job done. For example no longer do you need someone to help you get permits. The framework’s incentives for governments short circuit all that.\n\nThe end result: rapid, high quality data collection that any organization in good standing can quickly put to use.\n\nShow Me the Data\n\nSo what does the data look like?\n\nWell, here’s PLACE Aerial data for a street intersection near the Plateau Mosque in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire:\n\nAnd here’s the equivalent in Google Maps and Apple Maps:\n\nGoogle and Apple generally strive for the best available commercial satellite data, so you can see that the PLACE Aerial data is significantly higher resolution and thus significantly more useful for determining things like property boundaries, land use, economic activity and population. And of course it’s more than good enough for building a street map.\n\nThe PLACE Aerial data has a ground sample distance (GSD) of around 5cm. The is an order of magnitude better than typically available commercial satellite imagery which has a GSD of 40-50cm.\n\nBut PLACE doesn’t stop at collecting aerial data. They also collect anonymized street level data. Here’s a sample of PLACE Ground data for Côte d’Ivoire:\n\nPutting PLACE Data to Use\n\nPLACE data is a horizontal bedrock for so many uses: for governments just to be able to create an accurate map of their communities is a godsend. It can form the basis for understanding population and land use. It can be critical to stimulating economic development, administering healthcare and eduction programs or for fairer and more efficient property tax collection.\n\nFor commercial organizations the uses are many. In the insurance industry the data can help people understand risks, particularly for flooding. The data is valuable for building construction and financial modeling. And of course the data is a foundation for consumer applications: mapping, wayfinding and business search.\n\nThe data can be used to build models — quickly and efficiently — whether it be vulnerability analysis models for flooding or heat from buildings, or transportation models for routing goods or population growth models to benefit urban planning.\n\nAnd AI is only going to supercharge all this analysis.\n\nIn Africa in particular there is a desperate need for all this work. Populations are growing like crazy and economies are growing with it. For example, the population of Malawi is about 22M now but is expected to grow to 110M by 2050.\n\nWe should also expect many use cases for the data that people have yet to invent. Remember when iPhone launched in 2007? Who thought of Uber back then?\n\nThe same thing is going to happen in Africa. It has a population of 1.2B and the median age is only about 19. And despite what you might think, many of the young un’s are getting a good education — and many are super smart. So young African entrepreneurialism is going to drive growth: Africans creating businesses for Africans.\n\nThe potential is awesome. And it’s going to be fascinating to watch how PLACE Data is put to good use.\n\nPLACE’s Biggest Fans\n\nIn its three years of existence PLACE has already built a fan base.\n\nEsri is one. Obviously it fits with their secret evil plan of making sure everyone on the planet has an ArcGIS license, but in all fairness it actually perfectly aligns with Jack Dangermond’s sincere goal of wanting to make a difference.\n\nUniversities around the world love PLACE data for research as do many well known international agencies.\n\nAnd then there are the organizations that help governments process data, understand it and gain insights from it. Many of these are development agencies, a.k.a. ‘beltway bandits‘ in Washington, DC or similar organizations in other parts of the world.\n\nAnd of course AI companies like AtlasAI and Impact Observatory are loving what PLACE is doing.\n\nPLACE has 52 Member organizations at the time of writing and they’re adding about two a week. And they have funding from a number of significant organizations including The Global Innovation Fund, The Dovetail Impact Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, The Omidyar Network and The Mozilla Foundation.\n\nAs word gets out about PLACE I can only imagine that membership and funding will snowball.\n\nHow Do You Access PLACE Data?\n\nThe PLACE business model is simple.\n\nIt’s US$1,000 per year to be a PLACE Member. This is considered tax deductible if you’re a US tax payer. If you’re feeling generous you are free to pay more than $1,000 per year if you’d like. 😉\n\nIf you want to use the data for non-profit or not-for-profit purposes then there is nothing more to pay, but PLACE’s preference is that derivative works get published under a Creative Commons license.\n\nFor commercial use there is a one-time data license fee for the data. The fee is based on the number of cities that are licensed and there are discounts for multiple cities. Updates for a city are treated like another city. For example, the fee for the data captured of Abidjan in 2024 might be $X. You’d pay $X again for the data captured of Abidjan in 2025.\n\nCommercial licensees are not allowed to sublicense the data as is, but they are allowed to create derivative works and license those works for a fee. There are no revenue share requirements back to PLACE for derivative works.\n\nWhere Next for PLACE?\n\nPLACE has achieved a huge amount in the three years they’ve been in existence:\n\nThey’ve signed data collection deals with nine countries, including some large ones like Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria.\n\nThey’ve got alignment with those countries to make sure the governments have the right incentives to work with them.\n\nWith the PLACE Foundation and the PLACE Trust, they’ve got their organizational structures in place that will easily be able to deal with large scale data acquisition.\n\nThey’re getting traction with membership\n\nThey’ve got foundational funding from a number of significant organizations.\n\nBut they haven’t quite reached critical mass.\n\nPLACE has yet to put enough data on-the-shelf to generate significant commercial revenue. And so they need more funding to get to that critical mass of data so they can be self sustaining. I’m convinced they’ll get there, but it’s going to take more work — and frankly more cash.\n\nBut it’s going to get even more interesting when they do reach critical mass. PLACE already has plans to leverage commercial revenues to subsidize capturing data in areas of need rather than just in areas of interest. In other words: using the licensing revenue they get from licensing data for high growth cities to fund capturing data in poorer areas.\n\nAnother interesting sidebar: Peter’s framework for PLACE, particularly its organizational structure built around trust (with the PLACE Foundation and the separate PLACE Trust), together with the built-in incentives and alignment for cooperation has got key people in other industries thinking: could the same model work well for healthcare data or agriculture data? Hmm. There’s a thought.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about PLACE I’d strongly recommend visiting the PLACE website which is at thisisplace.org . Alternatively consider pinging Peter Rabley, Managing Partner of the PLACE Foundation or Denise McKenzie, Managing Partner of the PLACE Trust.\n\nI can’t wait to watch PLACE going forward. I’m sure there will be some great surprises to come…\n\nAcknowledgments and Footnotes\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to Peter Rabley, Managing Partner of the PLACE Foundation as well as to Denise McKenzie, Managing Partner of the PLACE Trust for taking the time to talk to me and helping me to get to know and understand the PLACE organization.\n\nIt should be noted that PLACE took no part in sponsoring this article (and nor did anyone else for that matter).\n\nFootnotes:\n\nA Curious Phenomenon Called ‘Etak’\n\nEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Or so said Steve Jobs when he announced iPhone in 2007.\n\nBut I’m talking about a different revolutionary product. A foundational product that forever changed how everyone on this planet gets to where they need to be.\n\nToday, I’d like to tell you about the Etak Navigator, a truly revolutionary product and the world’s first practical vehicle navigation system.\n\nHere’s a picture of it:\n\nAt the time, it was considered out-of-this-world. This is what Silicon Valley’s San Jose Mercury News said about it:\n\nThe Etak Navigator launched 39 years (!) ago in 1985. 😱\n\nBack then Reagan and Gorbachev were negotiating the end of the cold war.\n\nAnd it was the year Steven Spielberg released the film “Back to the Future”…\n\nAnd I’m sure at that time many of you were but a twinkle in your mother’s eye…\n\nBack in 1985 you used paper maps to navigate, like this one from a Thomas Brother’s map of Los Angeles:\n\nAs you can see, the maps weren’t always pretty. By today’s standards it was also supremely difficult and tedious to find locations and even more difficult to work out how to get there.\n\nSo, when the Etak Navigator launched, it was like something from the future.\n\nIt immediately got tons of press, including the front cover of Popular Science:\n\nNearly everything about the Etak Navigator had to be conceived from scratch.\n\nMost important was the self contained positioning system. Remember that back in 1985 GPS was not available (see “12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 8 — Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?“)\n\nBefore GPS, navigation systems used a technique called ‘dead reckoning‘. Dead reckoning relied on sensors to determine distance traveled and direction of travel. However, no sensor is perfect. As a result the further you travel the greater the errors build. Pretty quickly you have no idea where you are.\n\nTo solve this problem Etak invented ‘augmented dead reckoning’. This used a process to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a topologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the assumption that you’re driving on a road. At that point the location could be ‘snapped’ back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This technique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today.\n\nLike all attempts at building a navigation system before it, without this key invention the Etak Navigator would have failed.\n\nThe second key invention was a ‘heading up’, moving map display. This meant that the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and turned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what was displayed on the screen. This proved highly intuitive.\n\nThird: the Etak Navigator was also the first consumer device to introduce the concept of address search, or what the geospatial industry has come to call ‘geocoding’.\n\nHere is a clip from the only video I could find of the Etak Navigator in action:\n\nAs you can see the map moves and turns as the vehicle drives.\n\nThe buttons on the right control the zoom level which is denoted as the number of miles between the vehicle symbol and the top of the screen.\n\nThe top of the screen shows the current zoom level, the heading to the destination, the number of miles to the destination as the crow flies, and which way is north.\n\nThe address search allowed entry of destination by address, street or intersection. You could also store common locations like home and work.\n\nThe Etak Navigator had twelve buttons, six on each side of the screen.\n\nThese were soft programmed depending on the current function.\n\nIn the screen below you can see how street names were entered. Note how any letter or digit could easily be entered with just two button pushes. Also, you only had to enter the first few letters of a street name:\n\nAnd after that you simply selected the street from a list:\n\nThis is the Etak Navigator in navigation mode:\n\nNote that the Etak Navigator did not provide turn-by-turn directions. Instead you simply zoomed out the map to see your destination, shown as a flashing star. As you got closer to the destination you zoomed in revealing more of the local roads. You had to use your own noggin to determine the most appropriate road to take.\n\nThe lack of turn-by-turn navigation did not prove to be an issue. I know from much personal experience that the system worked very well!\n\nEtak Navigator System Details\n\nThere were five key components to the Etak Navigator:\n\nThe first was a vector CRT display — similar to what you might find in an oscilloscope.\n\nThe navigation app and data were stored on cassette tape. The cassette tape drive was specially developed to read the tape at very high speed. In a music player a cassette tape is read at about 5cm (1 and 7/8″) per second. The cassette tape in an Etak Navigator was read at about 200cm (80″) per second!\n\nThere was an electronic compass installed on rear window of the vehicle.\n\nTo determine distance traveled and to augment the heading info from the compass, magnetic wheel sensors were installed on the un-driven wheels of the vehicle. This involved sticking special magnetic tape on the inside of the wheels and mounting magnetic sensors on the brake calipers.\n\nFinally there was metal box about the size of a shoe box that contained the CPU and motherboard. This was installed in the trunk.\n\nThe cassette tapes stored both the navigation app and the map data. The maps were called “Etak Maps”. It took 6 tapes to cover the San Francisco Bay Area:\n\nThe original price for the Etak Navigator was US$1,395:\n\nThat’s the equivalent of about US$4,000 today.\n\nOn top of the cost of the Navigator there was an expensive installation cost: it took an experienced technician about 4 hours to install the whole system.\n\nJust Some of the Technical Hurdles\n\nBack in 1985 there were huge technical constraints.\n\nGPS barely existed. In those days the government prevented anyone but the military getting more than 100 meter accuracy. And GPS receivers were both large and expensive.\n\nIn addition there were no large capacity interchangeable media. Floppy disks couldn’t store enough information and CD-ROM technology was brand new and too costly.\n\nThe most important problem to solve was overcoming inertial navigation error from the wheel sensors and the compass.\n\nHere the solution was topological map matching.\n\nThis invention, above all others, made the product viable.\n\nAnother issue was data storage and latency.\n\nThe cassette tapes only held 3.5 megabytes and had 10 second average seek times.\n\nThe dev team had to invent a way of storing the 2D map on a one dimensional medium, making sure that regions close by on the map were also close by on the tape.\n\nYears later, when hard drives became cheaper and CD-ROMs became more readily available Etak’s highly efficient map data storage algorithm paid off in spades and resulted in very high performance maps.\n\nAnother problem was heat.\n\nUsers commonly left tapes on their dashboards and obviously dashboards can get very, very hot.\n\nYou can see from the tests that not all brands of cassette tape did very well:\n\nHowever, a brand that worked was finally found. It had a shell made of polycarbonate.\n\nYet another problem was dealing with inclines.\n\nThe map had no elevation information and so if you were traveling up or down a hill errors would be compounded in the system as the distance traveled on the road was not equal to the distance traveled on the map.\n\nTo compensate we therefore needed to know the slope of the hill. To compute this Etak’s lead hardware engineer invented a special inclinometer that used fluid and a capacitive sensor. In tests on various fluids he found that Tequila worked quite well!\n\nAnother problem were magnetic anomalies.\n\nBridges can be highly magnetic and can really throw off a compass.\n\nThe positioning algorithm therefore had to recognize these anomalies. When an anomaly was detected the positioning instead relied on the different speeds of the wheels to determine changes in direction. It wasn’t quite machine learning, but at the time it seemed pretty close!\n\nThe system also had to compensate for the magnetic fields generated by the rear window defroster.\n\nIn 1985 there wasn’t the luxury of 25 billion transistors and an M3 chip.\n\nInstead the system relied on an Intel 8088 CPU which had 8-bits, ran at 5MHz and only had 29,000 transistors.\n\nThus every line of code had to be incredibly efficient. It was all written in C, except for key parts of the OS kernel which were written in assembly.\n\nWhat about the digital map?\n\nEtak had to create it — more or less from scratch.\n\nOriginally Etak thought it could get maps from the government. Back then the US Census Bureau had something called GBF DIME files (which predated TIGER). But they were stick maps and didn’t contain any shape to the roads.\n\nEtak therefore embarked on a massive program to build a map of key metropolitan areas across the US and later in Europe.\n\nTo reposition the GBF/DIME files and give them some shape we used 1:24,000 scale United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps, otherwise knowns as ‘USGS quads’ as a reference.\n\nEach map was photographed onto 10” transparencies and then scanned using a very expensive drum scanner.\n\nThe entire map production program was developed and ran on a single VAX minicomputer. This blazing machine had 2MB RAM and two 400MB hard drives. It cost about US$120,000 in today’s dollars.\n\nThis little devil was burdened with a mammoth set of tasks. It supported:\n\n4 map digitizing workstations\n\nThe engineers developing and compiling code\n\nBatch jobs to process and compile all the map data\n\nThe company admins who used it for word processing\n\nThis was the coding environment:\n\nA dumb monochrome terminal.\n\nYou edited code using the ‘vi’ editor. Sometimes you waited an hour for your programs to compile.\n\nThe jobs to process the map data took up to two weeks to run … which was longer the the mean time between failure for the VAX mini-computer. The engineers used to joke that they should run the long jobs only immediately after a hardware failure had been fixed (knowing full well they were uttering a statistical fallacy).\n\nThe map digitizing environment was also revolutionary:\n\nEach digitizing workstation was comprised of a PC clone with an 8-bit color graphics card and a 19” monitor. Initially there were four workstations which were manned by three shifts a day. Later this grew to 36 workstations. Etak digitized maps 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8 hours a day on weekends.\n\nThe map editing system was the first ever to use ‘heads up’ digitizing and was a huge trade secret at the time. It was so secret that the methodology was never patented and the digitizing environment was walled off from prying eyes — especially from the CEO of a particular company called ‘Environmental Systems Research Institute‘ — i.e. a gentleman called Jack Dangermond who I’m sure would have leapt at the chance to borrow the concept. 😉\n\nBefore this invention people used to digitize ‘blind’ using digitizing tablets which was highly inefficient and error prone.\n\nEtak’s map production system leveraged the eight bits of the color graphics card very efficiently. 5 bits were used to display the scan of the USGS quad in greyscale and the other 3 bits were used to display the digitized map on top. The system was used to reposition the GBF/DIME files as well as to digitize new roads and edit road attributes like street names and addresses:\n\nThe Amazing Team Behind It\n\nEtak was founded in 1983 by a truly amazing engineer, Stan Honey.\n\nStan was already a world renown sailor. More importantly he was a world class navigator and had already beaten many sailing records across the Pacific by relying on his navigation skills.\n\nBefore founding Etak, Stan was a research engineer at SRI International in Menlo Park, California.\n\nStan has gone on to do many things. His most recent achievement was as the director of technology for the America’s Cup sailing races where he developed a system to track the America’s Cup boats to within 2cm, five times per second!\n\nThe original idea for Etak came when Stan Honey and a serial entrepreneur, Nolan Bushnell, were on a sailing boat together. Nolan had hired Stan to navigate his racing yacht through the 1983 Transpacific Yacht Race, a prestigious sailing event that spanned 2,225 nautical miles of open ocean from Los Angeles to Honolulu.\n\nNolan was famous for inventing the first video game, Pong, and later for founding Atari.\n\nThe story is recounted by Benj Edwards in his fantastic article for Fast Company: “Who Needs GPS? The Forgotten Story of Etak’s Amazing 1985 Car Navigation System“:\n\n[Early one morning Stan and Nolan were on night watch together.] They began brainstorming about a computer-based navigation system for use on land. Stan thought a navigation system for automobiles could operate based on dead reckoning and comparing one’s current location to known points on a map, a technique known as map matching. It wouldn’t need satellites at all, just a good digital map, a good compass, and some sensors. Then it could display the result on an electronic screen.\n\nNolan reaction: “Yeah, let’s do that and I’ll fund it”\n\nNolan always had an appreciation for where consumer technology might eventually go. In an interview for Inc. magazine in 1984 he said “Let’s say you’re in your car, and you want to go to dinner. You’ve got this box on the dash. You punch in ‘Japanese,’ then ‘cheap,’ then ‘good sushi.’ The box takes over and guides you to a place.”\n\nOne of Etak’s key hires was Marv White. Marv was a map scientist and mathematician and worked at the US Census Bureau on their mapping program.\n\nUnder Marv’s direction Etak’s map digitizing productivity was three times the industry standard. Since leaving Etak, Marv has gone on to many exciting ventures, including a period as Chief Technologist for Innovation at ESPN.\n\nThere were many other supremely talented engineers behind the Navigator, many of whom previously worked at SRI International: Ken Milnes, George Loughmiller and Alan Philips to name a few.\n\nMany of the original hires at Etak went on to other mapping organizations, including yours truly. When I worked on the Apple Maps team, 12 of my colleagues were Etak alumni.\n\nSo What Happened to Etak?\n\nThe Etak Navigator was about 20 years ahead of its time. Due to the cost of the hardware and the expensive installation process building a sustainable business proved to be very difficult (sound familiar?)\n\nInstead Etak quickly pivoted. It licensed the navigation code to the biggest automotive OEM hardware manufacturers at the time: Robert Bosch in Germany, GM in the USA and Clarion in Japan. In turn these companies developed their own navigation systems and, many years later, the concept of a ‘Personal Navigation Device’ from the likes of Blaupunkt, Garmin, Magellan, TomTom and many others was born.\n\nDuring the course of doing business Etak attracted the attention of a perhaps an unusual suitor: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. It was News Corps’ John B. Evans that saw the potential.\n\nLike Nolan Bushnell, John was a supreme visionary. You would often find him on the same platforms as Intel’s Andy Grove, Bill Gates and other technology megastars. Albert Scardino and Matt Falloon recount the story in John’s obituary in the Guardian:\n\nThe defining deal of [John’s] career came in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Murdoch invested $350m in a group of travel publications and directories. With one hand, Evans took over the consumer magazine division of Murdoch’s US organisation, including TV Guide, Elle and one he himself invented, Automobile. With his other hand, he launched a secret project in a suburban office building to develop a part of the travel group, the Hotel and Travel Index, into a new media product, codenamed Jaguar.\n\nIn the days before streaming video and large file capacity on the internet, travellers’ views of their hotels and destinations were limited to tourist brochures. Jaguar allowed an electronic visual tour of destinations, complete with views of the hotel room they had booked. Once integrated with major airline booking information and other databases and cross-referencing tools, the system threatened to leapfrog other airline, car and hotel reservation systems.\n\nIt was thus that John had the vision to use Etak’s maps and technology to benefit the Jaguar system. Thus John convinced Rupert to buy Etak.\n\nStan Honey recounts the conversations:\n\nJohn instantly saw the power of maps in media to change the world of classified ads, yellow pages, travel, and broadly answer the questions of “where is the nearest?” and “how do I get to it?”. Naturally, John and my shared sailing background created an instant group of common friends and experience. I remained close friends with John until he passed away and visited him often. Long after John had left News Corp, whenever I was tee’d up in New York waiting for a weather window for a Transatlantic record attempt under sail, I’d always invite John to come visit the boat, which he found fascinating as the boats were 100 foot monohulls or multihulls. I doubt that Etak would have ever appeared on Murdoch’s radar screen without John Evans’ vision and commitment to his vision, and to Etak. At the time of his decision to buy Etak, Murdoch also asked Barry Diller, who was then running Fox, for his opinion. Barry Diller was hard-nosed and direct in his questions, and had a slightly shorter term vision than did John, but Barry also supported News Corp’s acquisition of Etak, and focus on the maps.\n\nJohn really was a long-term visionary, as was Nolan Bushnell. During the Etak days, both would visit and “wind-up” the Etak crew with their predictions. That was very helpful as the two of them kept our minds wide open. But it was also helpful that they would mostly stay away because we were burdened with the need to actually get things to work, which visionaries seldom are. It is interesting to note that all of the things that Nolan and John predicted, have happened. It is also interesting to remember how far-fetched they seemed at the time of their visits.\n\nBut the times there are a changin’: as fate would have it in 1989 Murdoch sold the Jaguar system to Reed International for a profit of $500M. With Jaguar sold the relevance of Etak to New Corp lessened.\n\nNews Corp subsequently sold Etak to SONY, who then later sold it to Tele Atlas. And still later Tele Atlas was subsumed by TomTom. So what was originally Etak is now TomTom:\n\nBut Why the name ‘Etak’?\n\nThe answer goes back to the early days of Polynesian navigation. In those days the ancient mariners navigated the seas by relying on a series of environmental cues, such as the positions of islands around them.\n\nThey imagined that that their boats were stationary and that the islands moved past them.\n\nIn the same way, in the Etak Navigator the vehicle is stationary and it’s the maps that move past the vehicle…\n\nWith that in mind, Stan decided to call his company Etak, which is a Polynesian term for moving navigational reference points.\n\nBut Wait, There is One More Thing…\n\nWhen you look at any consumer mapping app in navigation mode, have you noticed something?\n\nHave you noticed something about the symbol used to denote vehicle location?\n\nDoes it look familiar? Well, of course it does …\n\nSo it turns out the symbol used by all navigation apps today is the same one originally invented by Etak.\n\nBut why did Etak use that particular symbol?\n\nIf you talk to the engineer who wrote the original code, George Loughmiller, he’ll be meek and tell you that it seemed like a good idea at the time. But you have to remember one thing: Etak was incubated by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari. And at that time both Etak and Atari were housed in the same office building at 1287 Lawrence Station Road in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nBecause Etak used a vector display with limited CPU, George needed a symbol that didn’t burden the very scarce computing resources. He also needed a symbol that was easy to read. A traditional symbol for a car — 🚗 — required too many lines. It also didn’t clearly connote direction. Something simpler was needed.\n\nLegend has it that one of Etak’s engineers got to see a pre-release demo of one of Atari’s latest games. And that game was…\n\nAnd what symbol did Asteroids use for their spaceship?\n\nAnd thus the symbol for vehicle navigation was born and is still used by all navigation apps globally today:\n\nSo There You Have It…\n\nEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.\n\nEtak’s many significant inventions included:\n\nthe world’s first in-vehicle nav system that actually worked\n\naugmented dead reckoning using map matching\n\nmoving map heads up display\n\nfirst use of geocoding in a consumer application\n\nalgorithms for highly efficient map data storage and retrieval\n\nheads up digitizing\n\nthe world’s first high volume digital map production system\n\ninventor of the universal map navigation symbol\n\nI was but a pimply engineer at the time.

And how did you deduce that seemingly trivial fact, I wonder?\n\nYes, dear reader, determining your location is no longer an arduous task. But you should quickly remember that for the average Joe or Jolie it’s only been that way for a very short while.\n\nIt took the pervasive proliferation of those pocket computers we now all carry around to make it so.\n\nBut only by 2016 did global penetration of smartphones cross 50% , so you could argue that it’s only been 8 years since the majority of people on this planet have been able to quickly determine their location.\n\nThat’s actually a pretty astounding fact.\n\nYeah, yeah — I know — there was a way to quickly determine your location prior to the dawn of iPhone. You could use your favorite personal navigation device (PND). But that only helped if you were in your car. And global penetration of PNDs never got a smidgeon close to smartphones.\n\nThis innate ability to determine your location can take so much stress out of you life. No longer do you have to roll down the window of your car in shame and, most of the time at least, no longer do you have to be so stressed about getting lost when you’re on a leisurely country walk.\n\nFor those of you that don’t remember, this is what it used to be like [click to play]:\n\nYup, that fear of being maced and tasered has receded somewhat.\n\nHowever, I should also offer the rebuttal to say that easy location determination has substantially increased our stress levels: it’s made possible by all those slimy apps that track your every move. See Map Happenings post: “Location Harvesters, Personal Information Brokers & Assholes“.\n\nMoving on.\n\nWhat effect has all this easy location determination had on our world? The list is of course somewhat substantial:\n\nReal-time navigation — by car, by train, by bicycle or on foot\n\nAn explosion of tracking apps for vehicles, shipments, rides, deliveries, aircraft, boats — and let’s not forget tracking birds and animals\n\nA complete revolution for search & rescue\n\nA complete revolution for surveying & construction\n\nEnabling a geo-index of nearly everything (photos anyone?)\n\nThe foundation for self-guided machines — tractors and bulldozers, drones and perhaps one day: cars & trucks\n\nSo, it’s pretty easy to make the case that this phenomenon should win a spot on the list of “12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World”. But how did it all come about? And what remains to be done?\n\nIf you’re so inclined I’ll take you though the story of how we got to where we are… and a little bit of where we’re headed. It ain’t all down to GPS.\n\nDetermining Your Location: First Things First\n\nA couple of things had to happen:\n\nSomeone had to invent maps (see “12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World: Part 1: The First Map“)\n\nSomeone had to invent a coordinate system (see”12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World: Part 2: The Birth of Coordinates“)\n\nThen someone had to invent how to determine your location. Figuring out your latitude (how far north or south you are) was a relative breeze. But by comparison, determining your longitude (how far east or west you are) turned out to be a real stinker of a bitch.\n\nThe story of how this problem was solved is an epic tale. TL;DR: the problem was solved by an uneducated carpenter from the north of England in the year 1759. It was all about clocks.\n\nIf you’d like to delve deeper may I suggest three options:\n\nOption 1: if you have 15 minutes: read “12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World: Part 4: The Epic Quest for Longitude“\n\nOption 2: for the full story: read Dava Sobel‘s amazing and best-selling book ‘Longitude‘.\n\nOption 3: if you’re like certain politicians and have difficulty reading: watch the PBS video “Lost at Sea” narrated by Richard Dreyfuss. Actually — even if you can read — watch the video anyway. It’s such a cool story.\n\nPrecursors to GPS: Acoustic Locators, Gee & LORAN\n\nAcoustic locators came first. They were used in World War I to determine the location of enemy artillery. The system employed microphones to measure the direction that artillery fire was coming from. With the use of two or more microphones at different known locations it was possible to determine the location of artillery using simple trigonometry.\n\nBut these weren’t like your average Shure microphones you use for podcasting. Take a look at this one from 1927:\n\nOr these Japanese ones from before World War II:\n\nNext up: Gee.\n\nGee, not to be confused with the clarified butter you might find in an Indian deli, was a radio navigation system invented by the Brits during World War II. By measuring the time delay from radio signals emanating from multiple known locations it was possible to measure position using a method called hyperbolic navigation. Gee’s main purpose was to allow bombers returning from a night bombing raid find their landing strips, thereby providing a blind landing system.\n\nThe methodology was a follows:\n\nTwo transmitting antennas positioned about 10 miles (16 km) apart on either side of a runway. A transmitter midway between the two antennas would send a common signal over transmission lines to the two antennas, which ensured that both antennas would broadcast the signal at the same instant.\n\nA receiver in the aircraft would tune in these signals and send them to an [oscilloscope]-type display… If the aircraft were properly lined up with the runway, both signals would be received at the same instant, and thus be drawn at the same point on the display. If the aircraft were located to one side or the other, one of the signals would be received before the other, forming two distinct peaks on the display. By determining which signal was being received first, pilots would know that they were closer to that antenna, and would be able to recapture the proper direction by turning away from it.\n\nThe guy that invented Gee, one Robert Dippy, later went on to help the Americans develop a longer range version, called LORAN — short for LOng RAnge Navigation.\n\nHow did LORAN Work? Well here’s a short 2 minute video courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution:\n\nLORAN evolved over the years. It first went live in June 1942 and was declared operational in early 1943. The original system begat LORAN-B (which was a failure), but that begat LORAN-C. The US LORAN-C transmitters became operational in 1958 and were managed by the US Coast Guard. The original LORAN-A systems remained operational until about 1985. LORAN-C was opened to civilian use in 1974 and the US transmitters were finally shut down on 8 February 2010.\n\nHas it all been replaced by GPS? Well as a matter of fact just like vinyl records, it is getting a revival. With the potential vulnerability of today’s satellite positioning systems due to GPS interference a new version of LORAN is being explored and selectively deployed. Called Enhanced LORAN or ‘eLORAN’ it is under consideration by a number of nations. Other countries continue to operate LORAN transmitters around the world.\n\nGPS and its Catalyst\n\nI think pretty much everyone has at least heard the term ‘GPS’. It of course stands for Global Positioning System. And, surprise, surprise, it has its origins in the US military. The GPS system is owned by the US government and is now operated by the US Space Force.\n\nThe catalyst for developing GPS all started after the USSR launched the first man made satellite, Sputnik 1, way back on 4 October 1957. Within hours of its launch two enterprising chaps, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, who were physicists at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) realized they could determine the satellite’s position by monitoring the radio signals and measuring the changes in frequency of the signals at known locations on the earth due to the doppler effect.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the laboratory’s deputy director, Frank McClure, asked them to invert the problem: could they pinpoint a user’s location given a known position of the satellite’s?\n\nAnd why was this so interesting? Well it all comes down to the fact that the US needed more effective ways to blow up the planet and one of them was by putting nuclear warheads on submarines. But a missile fired from a submarine couldn’t turn Moscow into a blob of molten glass unless you knew the exact position of the submarine relative to Moscow, preferably within a few hundred feet.\n\nIt turns out we can pinpoint the exact date on which the whole idea for satellite navigation was birthed. Guier and Weiffenbach’s recount the story in their 1998 paper:\n\nFrom here on, we were in for the adventure of our lives. On Monday, 17 March 1958, Frank McClure called us to his office and asked us to close the door. He asked us if anything new suggested that we had exaggerated our claim that we could find an approximate orbit from a single pass of Doppler data. When we replied that nothing had really changed, “Mac” asked if we could invert the solution, i.e., determine the station position while assuming the orbit is known.\n\nThis all led to the development of something called the Transit Navigation System. The first attempt to launch a prototype satellite for Transit was in September 1959 and the whole thing became fully operational in 1964. It was used primarily by the US Navy to provide accurate location to its fleet of Polaris ballistic missile submarines. Transit had a long history and didn’t cease its navigation service until 1996 by which time it was made obsolete by GPS.\n\nIf you want to dig deeper into the technical methodology behind Transit then I’d suggest reading Wikipedia’s page.\n\nWhat of GPS?\n\nAlthough groundbreaking the Transit system was deemed too slow and too intermittent to keep up with the speed of airplanes. A more accurate and reliable system was needed.\n\nFortunately Transit was not alone and in the 1950s and 60s several other systems were developed in parallel. All of them had one goal in mind: getting an accurate fix of land or sea based missile launchers before they launched nuclear armageddon. These other systems included:\n\nMOSAIC (1950-61): ‘MOSCAIC’ was developed by the Missile Division of Raytheon and stood for “MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control” It was essentially a 3D LORAN.\n\nProject 621B (1963-73): Developed by the Aerospace Corporation (1960-present) this proof of concept project had over 1400 scientists and engineers on staff. Aerospace had been commissioned by the US Air Force to continue work on determining navigation coordinates from satellite signals and in particular meeting an accuracy requirement of 15 meters. Through its fundamental research Project 621B laid many of the foundations for GPS. By the late 1960s Aerospace recommended a design that used 20 satellites placed in geosynchronous orbit.\n\nThe Timation Satellites (1964-74): these proved the feasibility of orbiting accurate clocks in space, a necessary requirement for GPS. In essence this was a 20th century version of John Harrison’s H4 chronometer from 1759 (see “12 Map Happenings That Rocked Our World: Part 4: The Epic Quest for Longitude“). The pièce de résistance was the July 1974 launch of the third Timation satellite which was the first to fly an atomic clock.\n\nBy the late 1960s it was clear that a solution to meet all the requirements was going to need a boat load of coordination and a boat load of money. So in 1968 the US Army, Navy and Air Force combined forces to form NAVSEG (Navigation Satellite Executive Group).\n\nAlas, the group had no power to enforce any decisions it made. So in 1969 the president of Aerospace, Ivan Getting, asked president Nixon’s science advisor for help. Rather than advocating for a presidential commission the advice was to continue to push the ideas through the military customers. It turned out to be an astute move.\n\nThe main customer ended up being a chap called Air Force Colonel Bradford Parkinson. Put in charge of Project 621B in 1972 he concluded that some elements of Project 621B, Timation and Transit were all needed if satellite navigation were to be truly successful.\n\nOn April 17, 1973 the US Department of Defense authorized the creation of the GPS Join Program Office with Parkinson as its lead. Over large meeting held over the Labor Day weekend in 1973, Parkinson was able to convince his cohorts in the military on a design for a system. The decisions about the system made at that meeting still prevail today.\n\nApproval was given to start work on 22 December 1973. Initially called “Navstar” and later “Navstar/GPS” and then simply “GPS” it was given a starting budget of US$150 million. It eventually cost around US$12 billion to build and deploy. Today the operational costs of GPS are about US$2 million per day.\n\nOver the next 15 years GPS development proceeded apace. Between 1977 and 1979 more than 700 different tests were conducted and various test satellites were launched.\n\nWell after midnight on 19 July 1977, a Rockwell Collins engineer named David Van Dusseldorp sat on the rooftop of a company building in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, adjusting an antenna every five minutes to receive a signal from the world’s first Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite, known as NTS-2.\n\nHis GPS receiver was a little more cumbersome than one you might be used to using today:\n\nOver the subsequent years more and more satellites were deployed. It took until 1985 before the production and development stage began. The first “Block II” operational satellite was launched in February 1989:\n\nGPS got its first test in 1990 following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait where the system provided invaluable navigational information to all branches of the allied forces. Media’s coverage of GPS’s use in the war helped increase awareness of the system and helped stimulate commercial interest.\n\nBy the time GPS was fully operational its future success was virtually guaranteed.\n\nGetting to Where We Are Today\n\nInitially the US Department of Defense kept GPS just for themselves. There was no access for commercial or consumer use.\n\nBut everything changed on September 1, 1983 when a Korean Airlines 747 jumbo jet en route from Anchorage to Seoul strayed into Soviet airspace and was shot down by a Sukhoi Su-15 interceptor. All 269 passengers and crew on board perished.\n\nAs a result of the incident president Ronald Reagan issued a directive making GPS freely available for civilian use.\n\nBut Reagan’s directive wasn’t sufficient to support consumer navigation as we know it today. The US government had implemented a filter called ‘Selective Availability’ which degraded the accuracy of the GPS signal for civilian use. It added intentional time varying errors of up to 100 meters (>300 feet) to prevent enemies of the US using civilian receivers for weapons guidance. So… no sat-nav systems yet suckers!\n\nBut there was a workaround. Because Selective Availability affected every GPS receiver in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with a known position could transmit the error to other receivers in the area. This methodology got a name: Differential GPS or DGPS.\n\nDGPS became so effective that it essentially overcame the original intent of Selective Availability. Eventually common sense prevailed and president Clinton ordered Selective Availability to be switched off on 1 May 2000.\n\nWhat of nefarious groups using GPS? Well the US military developed a new system that provided them the capability to deny GPS to hostile forces in a specific area of crisis.\n\nOf course with the advent of GPS other nations around the world were suddenly at a serious disadvantage. Friendly nations were beholden to the US. Enemies of the US were suddenly in deep, deep yoghurt. So of course other systems sprung up:\n\nOf note: you’ll see all these systems listed in the location specs for iPhone.\n\nNow Don’t Go Thinking GPS is Infallible…\n\nSo when you open up you favorite mapping app you’ll see that little blue dot magically zooming to your current location.\n\nSo you might think all the app is doing is simply taking a GPS reading and plotting it on the map.\n\nHa, sucker. It turns out it ain’t that simple.\n\nFirst: it’s common that you aren’t going to get any GPS signal when you have a roof over your head.\n\nSecond: if you’re in a city with tall buildings those GPS signals are going to bounce of the side of the buildings like a ping pong ball and as a result give you all kinds of false readings.\n\nThird: it helps to stay still. If you’re moving you’re going to get a less accurate GPS reading. The faster you move the worse it gets.\n\nThe iPhone specs give you a clue that it takes more than GPS to get that nice blue dot:\n\nNotice “Wi-Fi” and “Cellular”? Those two in particular play a big role in keeping your blue dot roughly correct.\n\nIn lieu of GPS a rough position of your phone can be determined by looking at which cell phone towers your device is seeing and triangulating a position from that:\n\nIt works, but only roughly (typically in the region of a few hundred meters).\n\nWi-Fi positioning works using a harvested database of known Wi-Fi router (a.k.a. Wi-Fi access point) locations. Similar to the idea behind cell phone tower triangulation where you know the location of the cell phone towers, this methodology works in roughly the same way.\n\nBut you need to build up a database of Wi-Fi router locations to make it work. Google got into a shit load of trouble for harvesting this data secretly back in 2008-10. How did Apple get access to similar information? Frankly, I’m not sure, but I’m guessing it was harvested from those billions of iOS devices that have a habit of wondering around.\n\nAnother way to keep the location accurate is to use location history. If at one point you know you’re at a specific location and then your phone’s compass and movement sensors see you heading in a particular direction at a particular speed then you can deduce your position at a later point in time. This methodology is called ‘Dead Reckoning‘. It has its limitations, but it stops the blue dot from jumping around too much.\n\nAnother method is to use known information about your current method of traveling. If you’re in navigation mode in your car, then hopefully it’s quite likely that you’re actually driving on a road. So the app can ‘snap’ the blue dot to the road.\n\nAs I’ve already opined there is a need for an accurate location across many, many applications and industries. As such much effort, time and money is being spent to improve location accuracy.\n\nOne method is called RTK (Real Time Kinematic) and was invented in the early 1990s. Basically it’s an evolution of the Differential GPS methodology that was used as a workaround for Selective Availability. It relies on a group of geographically distributed basestations on the ground that are at known locations.\n\nIn the last few years the big boys have introduced yet another way of determining your location. It’s called ‘Visual Localization’ and matches what your phone’s camera sees to a known database of 3D buildings. Apple Maps introduced this capability three years ago:\n\nIndoor Positioning\n\nGetting your position inside a building is a tough cookie. Several approaches have been tried and one of the most common “solutions” has been to push the idea of triangulation using Bluetooth beacons. Little do people know that in order to make it work you have to carpet bomb buildings with hundreds (if not thousands) of beacons. And then you have to replace the batteries in them every few months. Net/net: it doesn’t scale baby.\n\nAnother approach, used by Apple, is to employ a method called Wi-Fi fingerprinting. Apple’s Indoor Positioning system relies on this method by recording the interference patterns of the Wi-Fi radio signals inside a building. It’s also not infallible but at least you don’t have to install huge mountains of beacons.\n\nThe topic of indoor positioning is worthy a whole separate Map Happenings post. There are just so many misconceptions about so called “solutions”.\n\nUnderground Positioning\n\nHave you ever wondered how two tunnel boring machines can start burrowing a tunnel many miles apart and miraculously end up meeting in near perfect alignment? It’s always fascinated me anyway. Particularly when these machines weigh thousands of tonnes and, well, have a tendency to sink.\n\nGPS, Wi-Fi and Cellular methods are obviously not suitable. So how do they do it? The answer is using laser guidance. One of the leading companies to provide a solution in this space is a German company called VMT. Here’s a short video from their web site [click to play]:\n\nWhere Next?\n\nWith recent scary stories like the one about the Russians equipping their satellites with nuclear weapons, nations around the world are naturally nervous about the vulnerability of their satellite positioning systems. For example, GPS relies only on 24 active satellites to make it all work. You only have to knock a few out and GPS is pretty much kaput.\n\nAs a result the US Space Force is eyeing smaller, cheaper satellites to augment the GPS constellation. This would not only reduce the costs of the overall system but it could additionally reduce its vulnerability.\n\nAnd it also sounds like everyone’s BFF, Elon Musk, could be considering a commercial positioning system.\n\nBut I’ll leave you with one more positioning technique that is currently being researched by Hiroyuki Tanaka at the Earthquake Research Institute of The University of Tokyo. Here’s his paper in published in the esteemed journal, Nature, and a subsequent one published in Cell.com.\n\nThe concept is to utilize the relativistic and penetrative nature of cosmic-ray muons, thereby developing a completely new wireless navigation technique called wireless muometric navigation system (MuWNS). To quote the paper’s authors:\n\nThis paper shows the results of the world’s first physical demonstration of MuWNS used on the basement floor inside a building to navigate (a person) in an area where global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/ global positioning system (GPS) signals cannot reach. The resultant navigation accuracy was comparable or better than the positioning accuracy attainable with single-point GNSS/GPS positioning in urban areas\n\nYes, dear reader. Muons.\n\nFootnotes:\n\nReferences and Acknowledgements:\n\nSteven R. Strom: “Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation“.

Where would we be without you?\n\nVMT GmbH\n\nThose Views from Above…\n\nTo all of you young whippersnappers that take your many ‘entitlements’ way too much for granted: you simply have no inkling of just how lucky you are. To name just a few:\n\nThe interweb\n\nPervasive Wi-Fi (or ‘whiff-ee’ as those suffering from Frenchness have a habit of calling it)\n\nMore than 128K of RAM or 1MB of storage space\n\nAbundant electricity\n\nIndoor loos\n\nIn my day we had it tough. We were lucky to have a cup of tea — and a cup of cold tea at that.\n\nFor those of us curmudgeons who’ve been in the mapping business for a while we should add one key item to this list: it’s the luxurious abundance of “views from above” … otherwise known as aerial imagery.\n\nAerial imagery has changed how we see the world, it’s changed the way we map the world and it’s changed the way we understand the world.\n\nMany of you will know that back in 1985 as a young lad I worked on the team that pioneered the world’s first in-car navigation system, the Etak Navigator. The Navigator was nothing without its digital street maps, and because no one else had created them we had to make the maps ourselves.\n\nThis was not a trivial task. There was no Google Earth. There were no satellite views. And aerial photos were about as scarce as seeing a progressive at a MAGA rally.\n\nTo make our digital maps we had to make do with something called USGS Quads — printed maps at 1:24,000 scale that had been made by the US Geological Survey. Some of these maps were relatively new and had been created in the last year, and some of them, well — let’s just say they were a little long in the tooth — and were about 30 years old.\n\nSo the digital maps we created were far from being up-to-date. And we knew that. So much so that when we gave people the opportunity to challenge our address finder we always asked them “Where did you grow up?” rather than “Where do you live?”, knowing that we had a much better chance of getting the first question correct. 😜\n\nSo where did all these views from above emanate?\n\nWell, the first known aerial photograph was taken in 1858 by French photographer and balloonist, Gaspar Felix Tournachon, a.k.a “Nadar”. And, clever chap, in 1855 he patented the idea of using aerial photographs for mapmaking.\n\nBut photographs weren’t only taken from balloons. No, ingenious people also used kites and even pigeons. In fact in 1903 in Bavaria they even established the Bavarian Pigeon Corps for aerial reconnaissance. Managing flight paths proved to be a somewhat interesting challenge, however.\n\nIt was none other than a rather famous fellow called Alfred Nobel that took things to the next level in 1897. He produced the first successful aerial photograph from a rocket mounted camera.\n\nBut all this was before planes and, perhaps not surprisingly it was Mr. Wilbur Wright who took the first photograph from an airplane (in Italy!) in 1909.\n\nAs is often the case it was warfare that accelerated progress. First in World War I, where aerial photography quickly replaced sketching and drawing by people in planes. By the end of this war both sides were taking pictures of the battle fronts at least twice per day.\n\nIt was Sherman Mills Fairchild (1896-1971) who we should thank more than anyone for making the greatest advancements.\n\nAlas, in our world of 21st century high tech, Sherman Fairchild has unfortunately become a rather forgotten hero.\n\nOver the years Sherman Fairchild founded over 70 companies and they became famous for their focus on aviation, cameras and semiconductors.\n\nFor those of you that know how to use a rotary dial phone you might have heard of a famous Silicon Valley company called Fairchild Semiconductor. Sherman founded the company in 1957 and it became a pioneer in the manufacturing of transistors and integrated circuits.\n\nProbably what you don’t know is that Fairchild Semiconductor started as a division of Fairchild Camera and Instrument, itself established in 1927.\n\nDig deeper and you’ll find a story behind this company too:\n\nIn 1917 Sherman Fairchild had been rejected from serving in the military due to his poor health. Determined to find another way to support the war effort he went to Washington and won a government contract to develop an improved aerial camera.\n\nHis secret sauce: a camera specially designed for use in airplanes where stability and shutter speed remained a problem. By the end of the war Sherman had developed a camera with the shutter located inside the lens. This significantly improved the image quality and became the standard for aerial camera systems over the next 50 years.\n\nIn 1921 Fairchild Aerial Surveys started a commercial program to perform aerial surveys of cities and on August 4, 1921 the company produced a series of 100 aerial photographs of Manhattan at an altitude of 10,000 feet:\n\nBy World War II over 90% of the aerial cameras used by the allied forces were designed or made by Fairchild.\n\nHere’s the clincher: before Fairchild died in 1971, he saw his cameras carried on Apollo 15, 16, and 17, and while astronauts explored the lunar surface, his cameras mapped the moon from the Command Module:\n\nBut of course aerial photography doesn’t just come from planes. With the mad rush induced by the Cold War, it was satellites that came to dominate.\n\nHere the Map Happenings accolade for rocking our world must go to none other than Landsat, a program conceived by NASA in the heady times of taming the atom and going to the moon.\n\nFrom NASA’s history of the project:\n\nIn 1965, director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), William Pecora, proposed the idea of a remote sensing satellite program to gather facts about the natural resources of our planet.\n\nPecora stated that the program was “conceived in 1966 largely as a direct result of the demonstrated utility of the Mercury and Gemini orbital photography to Earth resource studies.” While weather satellites had been monitoring Earth’s atmosphere since 1960 and were largely considered useful, there was no appreciation of terrain data from space until the mid-1960s.\n\nAfter various political and military push backs NASA was eventually given the go-ahead to build the satellite in 1970. Within just two years, Landsat 1 was launched, heralding a new age of remote sensing of land from space:\n\nAnd it’s never been the same since…\n\nIf you want a great overview of what’s happened over the years, particularly in the world of satellites, then spend 20 minutes watching this very engaging video from my good friend, Max Lenormand, publisher of MindsBehindMaps:\n\nSatellite imagery has revolutionized the world in many ways — for weather, for agriculture, for environmental studies and of course for the military — but perhaps the most profound way it has affected all of us is for its use in map making.\n\nWithout today’s copious abundance of high resolution aerial imagery there is no way the likes of map makers like Google, Apple, HERE, TomTom, Grab, Baidu, KakaoMap and Yandex could do what they do — not only to make their"
