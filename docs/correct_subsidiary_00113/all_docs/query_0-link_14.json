        "text": "New 125,000 Square Foot Facility is the Largest Satellite Plant in the Eastern United States\n\nAbout 20 Satellites to Be Built and Tested in New SMF During Next Two Years\n\nThe largest U.S. satellite\n\nmanufacturing facility (SMF) east of the Mississippi River is now ready for\n\noccupancy, Orbital Sciences Corporation announced today. Located\n\nin Dulles, Virginia, about 30 miles west of Washington, DC, Orbital’s new\n\n125,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility will house all of the company’s\n\nsatellite manufacturing, assembly and testing activities. Orbital is the\n\nworld’s leading manufacturer of innovative small satellites that are used in a\n\nwide range of low-Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary (GEO) communications,\n\nremote imaging and scientific missions.\n\nThe company’s customers include\n\nnumerous U.S. and international commercial enterprises and government\n\nagencies. Over the past 15 years, Orbital has designed, built, delivered and\n\nlaunched over 85 satellites, which have amassed over 300 years of in-orbit\n\nexperience.\n\n“This new facility, one of the most modern in the world, is emblematic of\n\nOrbital’s commitment to producing the industry’s most reliable, affordable and\n\ninnovative small- and mid-size satellites for our customers,” said Mr. Robert\n\nR. Lovell, Orbital’s Executive Vice President and General Manager of its Space\n\nSystems Group (SSG). “The consolidation of our satellite manufacturing\n\noperations at one state-of-the-art facility will help us further improve our\n\nalready strong project management, operational efficiency and quality control\n\nprocesses. We expect that the new SMF will result in a better working\n\nenvironment for our employees and better products for our customers,” he\n\nadded.\n\nOrbital’s new SMF will include a 40,000 square foot “high-bay” area that\n\nwill house a full suite of environmental test equipment used to simulate the\n\nrigorous conditions of a satellite’s launch sequence and its operation in\n\nspace. The facility will also be home to two large “clean rooms,” totaling\n\nover 25,000 square feet, in which satellites are kept during assembly,\n\nintegration and check-out phases. A new satellite command and control ground\n\nstation for Orbital’s ORBIMAGE affiliate’s OrbView-3 and -4 high-resolution\n\nimaging satellites will also be incorporated into the complex later this year,\n\nwhich will include office space for engineers, technicians and administrative\n\nstaff who will work in the building.\n\nAmong the satellite programs that Orbital now has under way at other\n\nfacilities that will be moved to the Dulles SMF is N-Star C, a GEO mobile\n\ncommunications satellite platform, scheduled for launch in 2002, for a well-\n\nknown Japanese customer, NTT DoCoMo. In addition to pursuing GEO satellite\n\nprojects, which is an emerging market niche for Orbital’s satellite\n\ncapabilities, the company will also perform work on numerous LEO satellites at\n\nthe SMF. Among near-term LEO satellite projects to be housed in the SMF are\n\nseveral scientific spacecraft for NASA, including two known by the acronyms\n\nSORCE and QuickTOMS, as well as up to 15 additional ORBCOMM satellites that\n\nmay be added to the 35 in-orbit spacecraft in ORBCOMM’s wireless data\n\ncommunications network.\n\nThe SMF is a centerpiece of Orbital’s Dulles, Virginia campus expansion\n\ndesigned to accommodate the company’s fast-growing business. In addition to\n\nthe SMF, Orbital has recently completed two new 90,000 square foot buildings\n\ncontaining office, laboratory, administrative and employee amenity space. With\n\nan additional 160,000 square foot office building now under construction for\n\ncompletion in 2001, Orbital is planning about a three-fold increase in the\n\nsize of its Dulles campus, which occupies over 70 acres, both in terms of\n\nemployees and facilities. Orbital’s Dulles facilities will increase to over\n\n600,000 square feet and its employees based at Dulles will increase to nearly\n\n2,000 over the next year.\n\nOrbital is one of the largest space technology and satellite services\n\ncompanies in the world, with 1999 total enterprise revenues of about $915\n\nmillion. The company, which is headquartered in Dulles, Virginia, employs\n\nabout 5,500 people at major facilities in the United States, Canada and\n\nseveral overseas locations. Orbital is the world’s leading manufacturer of\n\nlow-cost space systems, including satellites, launch vehicles, electronics and\n\nsensors, satellite ground systems and related digital infrastructure. Its\n\nMagellan subsidiary is a pioneer in satellite-based navigation and\n\ncommunications products for consumer and industrial markets. Through its\n\nORBCOMM and ORBIMAGE affiliates and ORBNAV subsidiary, Orbital is also a major\n\noperator of satellite-based networks that provide data communications, high-\n\nresolution imagery and automotive information services to customers all around\n\nthe world."
