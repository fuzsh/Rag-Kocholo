        "text": "GPS: A short history\n\nGPS or the global positioning system, the technology that is used by billions globally has its origins since the cold war. The United State’s department of defense experimented on creating a sturdy navigation system utilizing satellites during the 1970’s. Aim was to be able to detect nuclear submarines. The first satellite called the NAVSTAR (Navigation System with Timing and Ranging) became operational in 1978. The global system covering pole to pole, consisted of twenty-four satellite, came into effect in 1993. Today the GPS is a US government owned and US Airforce operated technology, that powers billions of devices worldwide. The GPS laid down the basis of map optimization, tracking and geo-fencing platforms all over the planet. What started out as a means for military ambition, has now made it way into everyday life. Mobile phones, tablets and computers make use of GPS systems to accurately pinpoint locations and figure out delivery routes. Thanks to GPS the world enjoys faster commute times and effort saving behind accurate route mapping. The GPS has paved way for a multitude of businesses.\n\nIntroduction to Magellan\n\nMagellan is a world leader in providing GPS technology. It is owned by MiTAC International Corporation and is based in Dallas, USA. Orbital Sciences Corporation originally owned the company since its acquisition in 1994. However, in 2001 things took a turn when Magellan was bought by Thales Navigation and then later acquired by Shah Capital Partners for a staggering $170 million. The company pioneered development of the NAV 1000 (including pioneering a mobile handheld satellite receiver that could work around the world). Several innovations later Magellan again shifted hands but this time under Mio Technology. Later the name was changed to MiTAC digital Corporation. Boasting an impressive range of technologies, the free Magellan software can be downloaded easily from their website. The company makes sure that the technology they develop is robust and user friendly. This has been an important reason on why they have been so successful.\n\nImportance of upgrading your Magellan software\n\nAn oft recurring question arises on how to download maps to a Magellan GPS. Like any other technology stack, the Magellan GPS needs to be updated periodically for it to be able to run optimally. The benefits of running upgrades includes the device to run faster; addition of new areas and update on the mapping scenarios. It is especially important to be up to date since the maps of the world are constantly changing. Existing roads may be closed off and new routes might crop up from time to time. If a user is running on an older version, they risk of getting lost. Upgrades also allow smoother real-time navigation since the map does not need to download maps on the go.\n\nHow to Update a Magellan GPS\n\nBefore running an upgrade it is advisable to fully charge your device so that the downloading process does not get bogged down midway. Keep the charger connected to the device in any case. Connect to a high speed internet connection so that the download can happen uninterrupted. As a pre requisite, the Magellan content manager needs to be downloaded as this content manager is the primary application to cater for the system maintenance. In order to be able to receive timely updates register on the Magellan portal.\n\nFollow the below instructions to make an upgrade:\n\n1. Open the web browser and navigate to the Magellan website\n\n2. Under the “downloads” tab, click the content manager\n\n3. Download the file onto the computer system and install\n\n4. Connect the GPS device with the system via the USB port\n\n5. Click the “check for updates” button and the device will communicate with the content manager on the system to check if there are any recent updates.\n\n6. If a new update is available and applicable, click on it to enable the installation\n\n7. The device will run installation sequence and inform that the updates have been made successfully.\n\n8. Incase an upgrade to the software is needed the device will prompt for it\n\n9, Upon completion of installation the device will restart itself\n\nHow do I use my Magellan GPS\n\nOnce the Magellan GPS is updated and ready to be used, use the below procedure to use the GPS to reach the desired destination.\n\n1. Long press the power button until the GPS turns on\n\n2. Make a selection of the required language, the region and the time zone. The menu can be scrolled thought via the arrow keys\n\n3. The GPS device may take some to home in on the signal and start receiving. There maybe some hindrance in mountainous terrain, bridges or tunnels. A good idea is to move the device to as much of an open space as possible. When the location starts showing up on screen it means that the signal has been acquired and that the device is ready to be used.\n\n4. Use the search bar to input the location of the destination. Try using as accurate spelling as possible as the engine matches the locations based on keyword matches. Hit enter upon input.\n\n5. The tentative route will pull up on screen. Based on how far the location is the estimated distance and expected time will show up as well.\n\n6. The icon will show the direction where one is pointing to and navigation can begin\n\nConclusion\n\nGPS is a wonderful technology that has enabled billions of users globally. Hard benefits include billions of gallons of oil to be saved, since the technology’s inception. The oil would have otherwise been spent in motor vehicles during finding of locations via hit and trial. Hundreds of billions of hours have been saved that otherwise would have had been lost, trying to find an intended place. This signifies how important of a role technology has in our daily lives and how it can work as an enabler for the masses. Using a Magellan GPS system can help make use of time efficiently and provide hassle free commute for users. What makes Magellan amazing is its vast community, tech support and ever-growing ecosystem. The hardware support is present in a plethora of countries while software support is available globally."
