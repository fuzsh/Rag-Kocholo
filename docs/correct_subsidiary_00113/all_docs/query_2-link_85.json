The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:18 a.m., in Room 2318 of the Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Sherwood L. Boehlert [Chairman of the Committee] presiding. hearing charter COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The Future of Human Space Flight thursday, october 16, 2003 10:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. 2318 rayburn house office building 1. Purpose The Committee on Science will hold a hearing on The Future of Human Space Flight on October 16, 2003 at 10:00 a.m. in Room 2318 of the Rayburn House Office Building. The hearing will examine the rationale for human presence in space, the feasibility and cost of various potential long-term goals, and the near-term implications of establishing these goals. 2. Overarching Questions The witnesses will outline their perspectives on human space flight and lay out various options that could be pursued. Overarching questions that will be addressed are: What is the U.S. likely to gain by the proposed options for human space flight and why could such gains not be obtained in other ways? What is a rough estimate of the costs of pursuing any of the proposed options? What is the approximate amount of time that it would take to achieve the goals of the proposed options? What are the technical hurdles that must be overcome in pursuing the options and the steps that must be taken to overcome those hurdles? (i.e., are there intermediate program goals and when might these be achieved?) What are the implications of the options for the current human space flight program? To what degree does the current program contribute to, or impede other options that could be pursued? 3. Key Issues In the aftermath of the Columbia tragedy and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report, the Nation has a rare opportunity to re- examine the vision and goals of the human space flight program. The following are some of the key issues: Is there a compelling reason for human presence in space? The Apollo program to send a man to the Moon was clearly tied to a broader national goal, winning the Cold War. Today, NASA's human space flight program lacks a similar goal and is not tied to any national imperative. While NASA officials often argue that a human presence in space is necessary to carry out scientific research, even many advocates of human space flight suggest that science alone is not a compelling justification because much research can be conducted with unmanned probes. Instead advocates point to other rationales, including the human imperative to explore, a need for a strategic presence ,in space, the potential for technological spinoffs, and the possible development of human colonies in space, which they say could be especially important in the event of a natural or human-induced calamity on Earth. What are the appropriate roles for robotic exploration and human exploration? Robotic spacecraft have landed on the Moon and Mars, and (in the case of the Soviet Union) on Venus. Robotic spacecraft have flown by every planet in the Solar System with the exception of Pluto, and NASA is currently developing a mission to that planet. Robotic spacecraft provide a wealth of scientific information and typically cost a fraction of what a human mission costs. In January 2004, NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers Mission will land two identical rovers, named Spirit and Opportunity, on the Martian surface to search for clues of water. This mission cost less than $1 billion. In some cases, robotic spacecraft and human missions work together to perform complementary tasks, such as when astronauts service and repair the Hubble Space Telescope or when robotic missions are used to scout out landing sites for human missions as was done before Apollo. Key issues include: What is the appropriate balance between robotic and human missions? What activities can only be accomplished with humans? Should NASA focus its efforts on robotic exploration until a suitable purpose can be developed and agreed upon for human exploration? How would the Space Shuttle, the International Space Station and other aspects of the current human space flight program fit with any vision for NASA's future? Neither the Space Shuttle nor the Space Station has met its primary original goal. The Shuttle, for example, has not led to low-cost, routine, and reliable access to space; the Space Station is no longer being designed to provide a space-based platform to assemble and launch missions beyond Earth's orbit. Some advocates of a bolder mission for NASA argue that both the Shuttle and the Space Station consume large amounts of money simply to send humans repeatedly into Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) without moving toward any more ambitious or compelling goal. Others point out that the Space Station could contribute to future missions by providing data on how the human body reacts to prolonged stays in space. It is not clear how the Orbital Space Plane--the next vehicle on the drawing boards at NASA--would contribute to future missions. While NASA has talked about having the Space Plane contribute to longer-range goals, it is being designed only to ferry astronauts back and forth to the Space Station. What technological barriers must be overcome? Human space flight is inherently dangerous. Human space exploration beyond Earth orbit is particularly hazardous because the radiation environment beyond the protective Van Allen belts\\1\\ is much greater than the radiation levels experienced on the Space Station. Furthermore, the increased distance from Earth makes it impractical, and in some cases impossible, to return quickly if a problem arises. Also, it has been clearly demonstrated that near-zero-gravity has a slowly debilitating effect on human physiology. For example, astronauts can lose between six and 24 percent of their bone mass over the course of a year in space.\\2\\ Depending on the duration and destination of the mission, improved technologies for propulsion, power, and life support systems may need to be developed. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The Van Allen Belts are layers of charged high-energy particles located above Earth's atmosphere (4000 to 40,000 miles up). The Earth's magnetic field traps the particles and protects astronauts on the Space Station from cosmic radiation. \\2\\ http://spaceresearch.nasa.gov/general-info/ issphysiology.html What can we afford? The U.S. spends more than $6 billion annually on human space flight, including the Space Shuttle, Space Station, and Space Station research. This amount accounts for more than 40 percent of NASA's budget. Both Space Station and Space Shuttle have cost significantly more than originally expected and, following the Columbia tragedy, Shuttle costs are likely to increase. A large and sustained investment is likely to be necessary for any ambitious human space flight mission to succeed. NASA spending accounted for as much as 3.5 percent of the entire federal budget during the Apollo program, but today represents less than one percent of federal spending. Is the U.S. prepared to make NASA a sustained funding priority? 4. Background--Previous Studies on Future Goals for Space\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Based on Congressional Research Service Report 95-873, Space Activities of the United States, CIS [the Commonwealth of Independent States] and other Launching Countries/Organizations 1957-1994, Marcia S. Smith, Specialist in Science and Technology Policy --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Over the last 40 years, numerous studies, commissions, and task forces have attempted to address the future of the U.S. civil space program, and the human space flight program in particular. The following provides a summary of several key studies. National Commission on Space--(The Paine Commission, 1986) In 1984, Congress created a commission to look at the long-term future of the civil space program. Chaired by former NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, the 15-member panel spent a year developing a 50-year plan. This plan was detailed in their report Pioneering the Space Frontier. In summary, the Commission called for the United States to lead the way in opening the inner solar system for science, exploration, and development. The Commission envisioned the establishment of bases on the Moon and Mars and the creation of a routine transportation system among the Earth, Moon, and Mars. The Commission emphasized that it was not trying to predict the future, but rather show what the United States could do if it chose to do so. The Commission envisioned human exploration missions returning to the Moon by 2005 and going to Mars by 2015. The report detailed a program involving both robotic and human exploration, acting synergistically to achieve the goal of opening the solar system. The report did not provide a cost estimate for carrying out its recommendations, but identified three principal benefits: (1) advancement of science and technology; (2) economic benefit of low-cost launch systems; and (3) opening up new worlds on the space frontier. Leadership and America's Future in Space--(The Ride Report, 1987) Astronaut Sally Ride's report Leadership and America's Future in Space was prepared as an internal NASA report. The report stated that the U.S. had lost its leadership in space and was in danger of being surpassed by other countries. The report argued that to regain leadership the U.S. space program must have two attributes: (1) a sound program of scientific research and technology development; and (2) significant and visible accomplishments. The report detailed four programs areas for comparatively near-term (15-20 year) activities: Mission to Planet Earth (now called Earth Science), robotic exploration of the solar system, a Moon base, and sending humans to Mars. The report recommended that NASA pursue programs in each of these areas. The report envisioned humans returning to the Moon by 2000, preceded by robotic probes to select a site for the Moon base. The report proposed one-year expeditionary missions to Mars between 2005 and 2010. The report concluded that settling Mars should be an eventual goal. As a result of the Ride report, NASA established the Office of Exploration to investigate long-range proposals for human exploration to the Moon and Mars. President Bush's Space Exploration Initiative (SEI)--1989-1993 On July 20, 1989, the 20th anniversary of the first Apollo landing on the Moon, President Bush made a major space policy address, endorsing the goal of returning humans to the Moon and then going on to Mars ``in the 21st Century.'' The program was referred to as the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI). At the time the President made his statement in 1989, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget suggested that the program would cost $400 billion over 30 years. While Congress endorsed the philosophy of the program, Congress was reluctant to approve the program because of the expected cost. The SEI program was formally terminated in 1993 and the NASA Office of Exploration was dismantled. The Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program--(The Augustine Report, 1990) In 1990, concerns about problems with several NASA programs (Hubble Space Telescope's flawed mirror, hydrogen leaks grounding the Shuttle for five months, and several issues with the Space Station program) prompted the White House to strongly encourage NASA to establish an outside advisory panel to reviews its programs and management. The panel was chaired by then-Chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta Inc., Norman Augustine. The panel recommended that NASA's budget increase by 10 percent per year after inflation. The report recommended activities for NASA in five major areas. They were: (1) Space Science (e.g., Hubble Space Telescope), which the report said should be NASA's highest priority and be maintained at 20 percent of NASA's overall budget; (2) Mission to Planet Earth (now called Earth Science); (3) Mission from Planet Earth, which would include robotic spacecraft needed as precursors to human exploration. The long-term goal would be human exploration of Mars. No specific timetable for this mission was set. Instead, the panel urged NASA to adopt a philosophy of ``go-as-you- pay;'' (4) space technology, (i.e., design of subsystems and materials for spacecraft) for which the report said spending should double or triple; and (5) development of a ``heavy lift'' unmanned, expendable launch vehicle to complement the Space Shuttle. The panel stated that if the 10 percent budget increases were not available the programs should be prioritized as follows: (1) Space Science; (2) Mission to Planet Earth; (3) heavy lift launch vehicle; (4) technology development: and (5) Mission from Planet Earth. National Academy of Sciences Study--The Human Exploration of Space, 1997 In 1997, the Academy undertook a study of the role of science in human space exploration. The study examined scientific activities that must be conducted before human exploration beyond Earth orbit could be practically undertaken and science that would be enabled or facilitated by human presence. The study concluded that clear goals must be set and that an integrated science program, with the appropriate balance of human and robotic missions, to collect relevant data to enable future missions beyond Earth orbit should be pursued. Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB)--(The Gehman Report, 2003) In its August report, the CAIB concluded that there was a problematic mismatch between NASA's missions and its budget. This occurred because NASA and/or Congress failed to scale back NASA's missions when funding did not match requested levels or when initial cost estimates proved to be inaccurate. The CAIB also pointed out that ``for the past three decades, NASA has suffered because of the ``lack. . .of any national mandate providing NASA a compelling mission requiring human presence in space.'' The CAIB stated that investments in a ``next generation launch vehicle'' will be successful only if the investment ``is sustained over the decade; if by the time a decision to develop a new vehicle is made there is a clearer idea of how the new space transportation system fits into the Nation's overall plans for space; and if the U.S. Government is willing at the time a development decision is made to commit the substantial resources required to implement it.''

Witness Questions All the witnesses except Dr. Koss were asked to layout an option that they believed NASA should pursue and answer the following questions in their testimony: What is the U.S. likely to gain by your proposed option for human space flight and why could such gains not be obtained in other ways? What is a rough estimate of the costs of pursuing your proposed option? What is the approximate amount of time that it would take to achieve the goals of your proposed option? What are the technical hurdles that must be overcome in pursuing your option and the steps that must be taken to overcome those hurdles? (i.e., are there intermediate program goals and when might these be achieved?) What are the implications of your option for the current human space flight program? To what degree does the current program contribute to, or impede other options that could be pursued? Dr. Koss was asked to answer these questions: How necessary is it to have the participation of people in space for successful research in material sciences? What proportion, if any, of the experiments now conducted on the Space Shuttle or Space Station could be conducted autonomously with unmanned systems? If researchers no longer had access to the Space Shuttle or Space Station how would advancement in the material sciences be affected? What alternatives exist to carry to orbit micro- gravity experiments that could be conducted autonomously if the Space Shuttle or Space Station were not available for whatever reason? If none, how much would it cost NASA to provide researchers such an alternative? To what extent, if any, would a more ambitious mission for NASA, such as sending people back to the Moon or to Mars, be likely to provide material science researchers with unique opportunities for experimentation? 7.

ATTACHMENT A Excerpted from the Columbia Accident Investigation Board Report Volume 1, Chapter 9, August 2003. ``Lack of a National Vision for Space'' In 1969 President Richard Nixon rejected NASA's sweeping vision for a post-Apollo effort that involved full development of low-Earth orbit, permanent outposts on the Moon, and initial journeys to Mars. Since that rejection, these objectives have reappeared as central elements in many proposals setting forth a long-term vision for the U.S. Space program. In 1986 the National Commission on Space proposed ``a pioneering mission for 21st century America: To lead the exploration and development of the space frontier, advancing science, technology, and enterprise, and building institutions and systems that make accessible vast new resources and support human settlements beyond Earth orbit, from the highlands of the Moon to the plains of Mars.'' \\4\\ In 1989, on the 20th anniversary of the first lunar landing, President George H.W. Bush proposed a Space Exploration Initiative, calling for ``a sustained program of manned exploration of the solar system.'' \\5\\ Space advocates have been consistent in their call for sending humans beyond low-Earth orbit as the appropriate objective of U.S. space activities. Review committees as diverse as the 1990 Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program, chaired by Norman Augustine, and the 2001 International Space Station Management and Cost Evaluation Task Force have suggested that the primary justification for a space station is to conduct the research required to plan missions to Mars and/or other distant destinations. However, human travel to destinations beyond Earth orbit has not been adopted as a national objective. The report of the Augustine Committee commented, ``It seems that most Americans do support a viable space program for the Nation--but no two individuals seem able to agree upon what that space program should be.'' \\6\\ The Board observes that none of the competing long-term visions for space have found support from the Nation's leadership, or indeed among the general public. The U.S. civilian space effort has moved forward for more than 30 years without a guiding vision, and none seems imminent. In the past, this absence of a strategic vision in itself has reflected a policy decision, since there have been many opportunities for national leaders to agree on ambitious goals for space, and none have done so.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ National Commission on Space Pioneering the Space Frontier: An Exciting Vision of Our Next Fifty Years in Space, Report of the National Commission on Space (Bantam Books, 1986), p. 2. \\5\\ President George H.W.

Koss Matthew B. Koss is an assistant professor of physics at the College of the Holy Cross. As a scientist whose experiments were carried out on three missions of the Space Shuttle Columbia, I have been following with great interest the findings of the board looking into the Shuttle's demise. Though a piece of foam may be found ultimately responsible, as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board announced last week, on some level I feel personally culpable for the loss of the seven astronauts. In-orbit experiments like mine have been used to justify manned space projects like the Shuttle for decades. The truth is that the vast majority of scientific experiments conducted in orbit--including my own--do not require astronauts. The main reason for in-orbit experimentation is to observe how a scientific process works without gravity-driven influences. But almost all of these tests, save those that must be done on humans, can be controlled from the ground via computer or by robots in space. In fact, some of the best work is done this way when the crew is asleep, not moving about and causing vibrations. To be sure, a lot of important science has been conducted in orbit. For example, research on the large single crystals of silicon that are at the heart of computer chips arose from the many detailed studies of crystal growth on the Space Shuttle. But, in fact, experiments like these are often more efficient and yield more fruitful results when done without the involvement of astronauts. The science performed on the Shuttle can be classified as either a payload or a mid-deck laboratory experiment. Payload experiments are self-contained packages mounted in the payload bay, the wide open space in the back of the Shuttle. They either run autonomously or are controlled remotely via computers on the ground. Laboratory experiments are performed in the mid-deck or Spacelab module, and are done by the astronauts with computer assistance from the ground. My experiments, on the fundamentals of how liquids turn into solids, were originally planned for the mid-deck, where they would be controlled by an astronaut who was scheduled to do eight tests. But because of launching delays, the project was changed to a payload experiment that would perform tests autonomously. During the flight, initial data was transmitted to the ground and analyzed by me and my colleagues. Performing the experiment remotely, without crew involvement, allowed us to do 63 test runs. (Remote-controlled experiments may seem to contradict images we have grown accustomed to--of happy, busy astronauts manipulating scientific equipment or talking about the science on board, or occasionally reporting on the objectives of experiments. But this public image of astronauts as laboratory scientists working on their own experiments is a bit misleading. Since the Mercury 7 pioneers, the astronaut corps has served one overriding political and public relations purpose--to sell the space program. The idea of using the Space Shuttle as a scientific laboratory actually came about after the Shuttle's design was already in place. The Shuttle program was conceived in the waning days of the Apollo program as the best option to continue a manned space program at the lowest cost. However, without a place to shuttle to, and not nearly enough satellites that needed a Shuttle to launch or repair them, the Shuttle program succeeded in doing little beyond creating a human presence in space. The idea of the Shuttle as an in-orbit lab was used as a justification for investment in its future. Similarly, the International Space Station has been aggressively marketed as a science lab. In fact, the Station is seriously flawed in that too much crew time needs to be committed to Station maintenance, and too many of the planned experiments depend on crew operations when they could more effectively be done without them. In many cases, the crew is needed only to deploy an autonomous experiment. Because of cost overruns and budget problems, the Station's crew was cut back to three from the planned seven. Originally, 120 astronaut-hours per week were to have been devoted to science; this has been cut back to 20 hours per week. With the Shuttle program grounded once again, it has become even more difficult to exchange crews, replace experiments or repair and refurbish equipment. Scientific experimentation in space can be safer and more cost effective using long-duration remote controlled orbital spacecraft. At the outset, the costs of developing this technology may appear greater than simply perfecting the Shuttle. But if you do not need to provide a safe and sustaining environment for astronauts--making sure takeoffs and landings aren't too fast, providing enough food and oxygen--the overall cost will be significantly reduced. If NASA is not able to convince the public of the importance of science in orbit without astronaut involvement, then so be it. At least America's refusal to support science would be honest, would not needlessly endanger human lives or compromise the integrity of science and scientists. We will always need astronauts to assume certain risks to develop the technology that allows for human exploration of space. The space shuttles and space stations may be necessary to fulfill that mission. However, we need to separate the goal of scientific experimentation from the desire for space exploration. I hope that the unfortunate death of the Columbia astronauts will forever sever the false link that has been created between the two. Astronauts do not risk their lives to perform scientific experiments in space. They fly to fulfill a much more basic and human desire--to experience the vastness of space. Chairman Boehlert. Now we get to the main event. I want to welcome the panel here today. On the Columbia accident, both witnesses and Members repeatedly made the point that NASA has suffered from the lack of a clear national vision for the future of human space flight. Over the long-term, NASA will be successful only if it is pursuing progress to include an agreement to pay for whatever vision is outlined. In many respects, we have the easiest task. It is easy for us to follow this program on a daily basis, are totally immersed in it, to have a grand vision, and authorize tons of money to help us achieve that vision, but it does no good if we just do our job and the appropriations don't follow, the Administration doesn't follow with the appropriate budgetary requests. NASA needs to do its part by coming up with credible cost estimates and schedules for projects, something that has been sorely lacking in recent decades, excuse me, and something that has not been done yet for the next human space flight project, the orbital space plane. Second, we need to keep in mind that human space flight is not the only NASA responsibility or, as far as I am concerned, the most important of its responsibilities, important though it is. I think the Augustine Commission got it right back in 1990 when it listed space science and Earth science as NASA's top priorities and added several more activities in order of importance before it got to human space flight. Third is a related point. NASA will not have an unlimited budget. The Federal Government has too few resources and too many obligations to give NASA a blank check. Anything that assumes massive spending increases for NASA is doomed to fail. That is especially true in the near future when the focus should be on getting the agency's house in order to carry out its current task. Fourth, we need to be honest about the purposes and challenges inherent in human space flight. Our witnesses today are pretty honest in their testimony on this point and we thank them for that. The primary reason for human space flight is the human interest, some would say destiny, to explore. Human exploration is not necessarily the best way to advance science or technology and it certainly is the most expensive and riskiest way to do things. I would add that nothing about China's launch, and we congratulate the Chinese for the success of that mission, augment these statements. Fifth, we need to learn from the mistakes we have made over the past 30 years. The Space Shuttle and the Space Station are remarkable achievements, something we are all too prone to forget, but they are also extraordinarily expensive projects, mind-bogglingly expensive compared to the original estimates, and they haven't performed as advertised or done as much as hoped to advance human exploration or knowledge. We have to avoid going down the same paths in the future. So we need to be thoughtful and deliberate and coldly analytical in putting together a vision for the future of human space flight. It has to be a long-term vision. We are not about to embark on any crash program. The technical challenges alone are enough to prevent that. We have assembled today an extraordinary panel to help sort these issues out, and I look forward to hearing from them. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Ranking Member, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hall. [The prepared statement of Mr. Boehlert follows:] Prepared Statement of Chairman Sherwood Boehlert I want to welcome everyone here this morning to this important hearing. At our previous hearings on the Columbia accident, both witnesses and Members repeatedly made the point that NASA has suffered from the lack of a clear national vision for the future of human space flight. Over the long-term, NASA will be successful only if it is pursuing a clear and broad national consensus with sustained and adequate funding. As the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) noted in its report, that hasn't been the case for three decades. Now, we ought to admit that one reason such a consensus has been lacking is that it's hard to reach and even harder to pursue over time. We need to be candid and realistic about that in our discussions today. And our vision can't be based on some dreamy, a historical view that we can recreate the Apollo era. I, personally, don't know yet what that vision for the future of human space flight should be. Today's hearing is just the beginning of our efforts to build a national consensus. But I do think there are some principles and ideas we need to keep in mind as we develop a consensus. First, any consensus has to be arrived at jointly by the White House, the Congress and NASA, and the consensus has to include an agreement to pay for whatever vision is outlined. NASA needs to do its part by coming up with credible cost estimates and schedules for projects--something that has been sorely lacking in recent decades and something that has not been done yet for the next major human space flight project, the Orbital Space Plane. Second, we need to keep in mind that human space flight is not the only NASA responsibility, or, as far as I'm concerned, the most important of its responsibilities. I think the Augustine Commission got it right back in 1990 when it listed space science and Earth science as NASA's top priorities, and added several more activities in order of importance before it got to human space flight. Third is a related point, NASA will not have an unlimited budget. The Federal Government has too few resources and too many obligations to give NASA a blank check. Any vision that assumes massive spending increases for NASA is doomed to fail. That is especially true in the near future when the focus should be on getting the agency's house in order to carry out its current tasks. Fourth, we need to be honest about the purposes and challenges inherent in human flight. Our witnesses today are pretty honest in their testimony on this point. The primary reason for human flight is the human impulse--some would say destiny--to explore. Human exploration is not necessarily the best way to advance science or technology, and it certainly is the most expensive and riskiest way to do so. I would add that nothing about China's launch alters these statements. Fifth, we need to learn from the mistakes we've made over the past 30 years. The Space Shuttle and the Space Station are remarkable achievements--something we are too prone to forget. But they are also extraordinarily expensive projects--mind-bogglingly expensive compared to the original estimates--and they haven't performed as advertised or done as much as hoped to advance human exploration or knowledge. We have to avoid going down the same paths in the future. So, we need to be thoughtful and deliberate and coldly analytical in putting together a vision for the future of human space flight. It has to be a long-term vision; we're not about to embark on any crash program--the technical challenges alone are enough to prevent that. We have assembled today an extraordinary panel to help us sort these issues out and I look forward to hearing from them. Mr. Hall? Mr. Hall. Mr. Chairman, thank you for that brief statement, and I am going to put my statement in the record. It is one of the best ones I have ever read, and I am really recommending to the rest of the Committee and all who have access, but in the interest of time and because of the excellent panel that we have--and I was going to even quote Dr. Griffin, I will go and put his quote in there when he said, ``The international faith and credibility of the United States is tied, in part, to the orderly completion of International Space Station. We must complete its construction to include the original seven-man crew capability and establish a utilization plan for the facility that returns as much value as possible.'' And the last thing is I believe we have the means to start an exciting chapter in human exploration. We just need to decide where we want to go and then get started. I would yield some time to the Chairman of the Space Subcommittee and yield back my time when he finishes with his time that I am lending him of my time. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Ralph M. Hall Good morning. I would like to welcome the witnesses to today's hearing. We appreciate all of you taking the time to come to the Hill to help us determine where the Nation should go with its human space flight program. Today's hearing is especially timely given the successful launch and recovery of China's first astronaut. China is now the third nation to be able to send its people into space. I want to congratulate the Chinese people on this achievement, and I wish them well. I would also note that the Chinese have indicated that this week's launch is just the first step in an ambitious and incremental program of human space exploration. It seems to me that we can take a lesson from their evident commitment to a phased set of goals for human space flight. I believe that we would profit as a nation from following that same approach. Mr. Chairman, it is proper that we take some time in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Columbia accident to determine the best path forward. However, I think we should move beyond a debate on whether or not we should have a human space flight program. There should no longer be a question of robotic versus human exploration--clearly, both will be needed to explore our solar system. Moreover, it has been clear since the early years of the Space Age that the human exploration of space is a fundamental expectation of the American people--indeed of people all over the world. Revisiting the debate over the role of human space flight in the aftermath of an accident is understandable. However, I think that it also symptomatic of our unwillingness as a nation to commit to a clear set of goals for. the human space flight program and to the resources required over the long haul to achieve them. We can and should do better. As you know, Rep. Nick Lampson on our Committee has re-introduced legislation that he first introduced in the 107th Congress. His bill, the ``Space Exploration Act of 2003'' (H.R. 3057), would establish a phased set of goals for America's human space flight program, whereby the achievement of each goal helps provide the capabilities needed to attain successive goals. Adoption of Rep. Lampson's bill would go a long way towards providing a rational framework for our human space exploration investment decisions. I am happy to be a co-sponsor, and I hope that other Members will join me in the coming days. However, whatever legislative approach we wind up taking, I hope that today's hearing will start the process of coming to some consensus on concrete goals. At the same time, we cannot allow our focus on the future to distract us from the needs of the present. It is clear to me that any talk of bold new human exploration initiatives will ring hollow unless we are first prepared to meet our existing commitments. In particular, I would echo the sentiments expressed by one of our witnesses, Dr. Griffin, when he states: ``. . .the international faith and credibility of the United States is tied, in part, to the orderly completion of the International Space Station. We must complete its construction, to include the original seven-man crew capability, and establish a utilization plan for the facility that returns as much value as possible.'' In addition, NASA will need to ensure over the near-term that adequate contingency plans are in place to protect the viability of the Space Station in the event of further delays in the Shuttle return-to- flight schedule. I hope and expect that such plans are in preparation. Mr. Chairman, budgets are likely to be tight for the foreseeable future. That's the reality. As a result, it is even more important that Congress and the Administration need to work together to come up with a clear set of goals for the future of the human space flight program. Given goals, we can then determine how much we can afford to expend on an annual basis towards meeting those goals. I believe we have the means to start an exciting chapter in human exploration. We just need to decide where we want to go and then get started. Chairman Boehlert. Are you yielding to Mr. Rohrabacher or Mr. Gordon? Mr. Hall. Well, either one. Chairman Boehlert. It is--the Chair recognizes the distinguished Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Space. Mr. Hall. And I ask that my entire statement be placed in the record. Chairman Boehlert. We would not miss that. Mr. Hall. Thank you, sir. Chairman Boehlert. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Gordon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Hall, for yielding your time. Let me first state that I listened to the Chairman's remarks with interest. And I want to say that I thought they were thoughtful. I concur. I think that it is a good benchmark for all of us, and---- Mr. Hall. Don't thank him too much. He is hard to live with. Mr. Gordon. Well, I mean this believer is right. And I think that if we follow that lead we will go on in a very good direction. We do need to get on and hear the witnesses, so let me just add my quick welcome. There are a couple of issues that I would like to hear discussed today. First, while I am obviously not an expert in these matters, it seems to me that having a base on the Moon would be a useful step for a variety of reasons, one of which certainly would be further human space exploration, if nothing else. Such a base would be needed to test many of the technologies and techniques required for human exploration. I would like to know your theories on that. Also the NASA Administrator says his vision for exploration is not about destinations. Instead, NASA will first develop technologies and then decide where to go. Somehow, that seems backwards to me. It seems to me that unless we are willing fully to commit to some concrete goals, NASA's technology investments will lack and be unfocused, inefficient, and wind up costing more than necessary. In addition, the reality is the technology programs that are not tied to specific and agreed- upon mission goals become very vulnerable to budget cuts or even cancellation over time. So as you go through your remarks, I hope that you can address these two issues. And thank you very much for being here with us today. Chairman Boehlert. Thank you very much. And all other Members of the Committee are at leave to enter your remarks in the record at this juncture. [The prepared statement of Mr. Rohrabacher follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Dana Rohrabacher I want to thank the Chairman for holding this timely hearing on the Future of Human Space Flight. Columbia's tragic destruction has once again demonstrated that the risk of human space flight include the ultimate sacrifice, and Columbia's courageous crew understood that. Their sacrifice, however, may provide this nation the needed spark to re-examine its requirements for exploring and conquering space. Because we are spending a lot of money and lives for exploration and discovery, the Nation must know why it is sending humans into space. The American space experience is about expanding human freedoms and having higher expectations. We do neither if we lack a clear vision of purpose for our national civil space program. Unlike the 1960s, today's NASA lacks a unifying and overarching purpose for planning human space flight missions beyond the Space Station. While we struggle with finding a compelling reason for a human presence in space, the Chinese Government had sent its first astronaut into orbit last Tuesday evening. If this flight is successful, the Chinese hope to possibly build a space station and explore the Moon within this decade. Recent scientific studies reveal that the Moon may contain five times more water than previously believed, as well as minerals that hold the promise of clear burning fuel for use here on Earth. The Chinese long- term human space flight program suggests that the Moon is more than just a place for planting flags and picking up rocks. China's quest for reaching the stars, however, is driven by more than discovery. The U.S. national security community has always suspected that China's ballistic missile and military reconnaissance capabilities are major components of a ``national integrated space capability'' with human space flight being a key element. I fear human space travel that beckons China will be used to tout its communist system. We must seize the opportunity now to develop a new game plan for our human space flight program--not to mimic a foreign power's pursuits, but to honor those courageous individuals that sacrificed all, and to benefit humankind. The tragic episodes of Columbia, Challenger, and even the first Apollo mission must not weaken our resolve to meet the challenges in the decades to come. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Smith follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Nick Smith This is an important hearing discussing future of human space flight. I would also like to thank our distinguished witnesses for joining us. The real question we need to be asking is ``What is the purpose of NASA?'' Our last hearing revealed that there is little consensus on this fundamental question. Only once this question is answered, can we ask how human space flight contributes to that purpose. So what should be the purpose of NASA? One perspective is that NASA could continue as a scientific research program. NASA has had successes with a scientific research oriented policy. We have sent probes to Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and the outlying planets. Data, collected by the Galileo probe, which ended its mission last month, suggests that there is much room for important research to be continued in Jupiter's moons. The Hubble telescope is producing important insights into the nature of the universe. For example, just in the last six months, scientists have used the Hubble to confirm Einstein's hypothesis about dark energy. Automated and remotely controlled experiments on the Shuttle have been extremely fruitful. NASA has had and should have a science-first orientation, and it has had dramatic successes and can make substantial scientific advances. Others propose that advancing human space flight should be front and center of NASA's purpose. Advocates of this position argue that we should, in effect, continue and extend President Kennedy's vision to occupying the Moon, Mars, and low-Earth orbit. Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the superiority of American technological and economic power. I do not find this persuasive. We were not pursuing human space flight for the sake of human space flight. We were furthering a national agenda by proving the superiority of our economic and political system. Today, this purpose is not there, and this argument does not translate well to today, even with yesterday's completion of the Chinese mission. Some people have argued that we need to continue human space flight to support scientific research. However, both Dr. Roland and Dr. Koss indicate in their testimony today how little scientific benefit human presence provides. Only human physiological research requires humans in space. The question must be: what produces the best and most cost effective scientific research? The problem with manned space flight is that whatever mission the flight started with, the mission always becomes getting the people back home safely. This not only undermines the scientific mission, but it increases costs enormously. Again, I would like to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for holding this hearing on the future of human space flight. It serves to shine a light on the important issue that this committee must grapple with: what is the purpose of NASA? [The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Jerry F. Costello Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee to examine the range of options for the future of the Nation's human space flight program. When NASA began 45 years ago, there was a national drive and enthusiasm for space exploration. The Apollo program to send an American to the Moon by the end of the 1960s was tied to the broader national goal of winning the Cold War. With both the President and the country energized, the U.S. was able to reach new heights and accomplish its goal by landing on the Moon in 1969. In an era when Shuttle launches are commonplace, this enthusiasm has significantly decreased. In the aftermath of the Columbia accident and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report, we have an important opportunity to examine the goals of the human space flight program and make comprehensive decisions about its future direction. My colleague, Nick Lampson, has taken an important first step in by introducing H.R. 3057, the Space Exploration Act, and I am pleased to be a co-sponsor. His legislation assists in establishing a vision for NASA's human space flight program. H.R. 3057 sets specific incremental goals that are challenging and build capabilities and infrastructure needed for an ultimate human mission to Mars. The goals established by the Space Exploration Act of 2003 are sequenced in terms of increasing difficulty and complexity. Achieving the earlier goals will provide the capabilities needed for humans to explore other parts of the inner solar system while supporting the Nation's scientific objectives. It is my hope the Committee will incorporate these goals in a NASA reauthorization bill. Further, as you know, China recently launched its first astronaut into orbit and intends to continue a long-range program of human space flight activities. I am interested to know how a sustained Chinese human space flight program will impact the United States. I welcome our panel of witnesses and look forward to their testimony. [The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson First of all, I would like to thank Chairman Boehlert and Ranking Member Hall for calling us together to discuss this all too important issue. The purpose of this hearing is to examine obstacles to advancing commercial human space travel. In 1961, President Kennedy set the national policy goal of landing an American on the Moon by the end of the decade of the 1960s. I have said this many times before, and I will say it again: The space exploration research program has been one of the most successful research programs in the history of this country. Research provided by our human space program has yielded many lifesaving medical tests, accessibility advances for the physically challenged, and products that make our lives more safe and enjoyable. Over 40 years ago, our leaders in the space program had the foresight to get us to get into this type of research. We also owe those leaders some homage for their foresight, and I am hoping that we will then have the foresight to continue this type of research. Currently, there is substantial debate on how our Human Space Flight program should continue. Some contend that human space flight is currently too risky and we should reduce flights or rely upon robotic surrogates. Others contend that the value we gain from human space flight warrants the risk and that we should return to flight levels we had before the Challenger disaster. But it is imperative that we stay ever so mindful of the safety issue. Space travel is inherently dangerous. Our success in this vital national endeavor depends on our never overlooking this basic truth. The assets and human lives that are risked in the exploration of space serve to underscore the value we place on the broad global benefits that it brings. The investment we make in their safety should equally underscore the value we place on them. [The prepared statement of Mr. Lampson follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Nick Lampson I would like to welcome China into the human space flight club. As only the third nation to successfully launch a manned spacecraft, China truly has achieved an amazing feat with the launch of Shenzhou 5. I was pleased to see Yang Liwei return safely yesterday and look forward to future peaceful Chinese space missions. It has been reported that China has plans for future missions, including the development of a space station and human exploration of the Moon. While I do not believe that China's future human space flight plans should be interpreted as the beginnings of a 1960's era ``space race,'' yesterdays successful mission means that we can't continue business as usual at NASA. History has shown that great nations explore. The United States must not turn its back on human space exploration at this critical time. We must return the Space Shuttle to flight and complete construction of the International Space Station. At the same time, this Administration and this Congress must provide the American people with a vision and a concrete set of goals for the Nation's future human space flight program. It is clear that China has goals set by its leadership, and we need the same. I am attempting to push NASA in this direction with my Space Exploration Act (H.R. 3057). This bill requires NASA to design and implement a long range vision for our future in space. The phased series of goals over the next 20 years that I propose in this legislation includes human visits to the Earth-Sun liberation points and Earth-orbit crossing asteroids, deployment of a human-tended research and habitation facility on the Moon, and human expeditions to the surface and moons of Mars. Once America gets started on achieving the first of the human space flight goals listed in the bill, we have gotten over the highest hurdle to success in the entire initiative. We will once again be moving outward beyond low-Earth orbit. And in the process, we will revitalize our space program, energize our industrial and academic sectors, create new opportunities for international cooperation, and inspire our young people. The real obstacle we face in overcoming the drift in the Nation's human space flight program is not technological and it's not financial--it's the lack of commitment to get started. Yesterday China showed that they are committed to future space exploration--will the United States follow suit? [The prepared statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Sheila Jackson Lee Mr. Chairman, Thank you for calling this important hearing to explore the future of the human space flight mission of NASA. I would also like to commend Ranking Member Hall, as well as the Chair and Ranking Member Gordon of the Space Subcommittee for their leadership, and tireless work since the tragedy of February 1st to ensure that Congress and NASA are on the same page--working together to find the best way to get NASA's vital mission back on track. I am committed to the mission of NASA. NASA plays many roles, and means so much to America today. NASA is a source of dreams for our young and old alike. It provides insights into the origins and destiny, and wonder, of our universe. On the way to this noble goal, NASA develops innovations that spur on our economy and keep us on the cutting edge of technology. NASA also inspires young engineers and scientists to push their minds to new levels of excellence. These people become role models for future generations of intellectual pioneers. I believe that there is something about the majesty of seeing humans in space that has a unique capability to drive young imaginations and aspirations. I also believe that it will be the young scientists and explorers in space, looking at the universe unfolding around them, who come up with the next great discoveries and visions of future missions. Probes and robotics can do a lot, but they cannot look around and wonder, or dream, or be creative. That is the role of humans, and therefore, must be a role of the NASA human space flight mission. I do not want to see NASA become an exhibit in museums and history books, instead of being the leader in technology and exploration that it should be. At NASA over the past decade, there seems to be a fundamental disconnect between logic and policy. I feel one the underlying causes of this disconnect is the lack of a clear vision for the future of NASA. Once that vision is created, once a mission is designed, I believe that the needs to fulfill that mission will become much more obvious. As we decide the needs, I am confident that American policy makers, American scientists and engineers, and the American people will step up the plate and launch us into the next millennium. The first step though, must be the vision. Key reports--from the Paine Commission, the Ride Report, President Bush's SEI in 1993, and the Augustine Report--all talked of exciting and provocative missions, usually to Mars, or back to the Moon to set up a human colony. But decades later, we still are not making notable progress toward either of those goals. It seems that we are close to glory in space, but are just not demonstrating the necessary commitment, and boldness. That is why I joined my colleague from Houston, Nick Lampson, in sponsoring H.R. 3057, which would ``restore a vision for the United States human space flight program by instituting a series of incremental goals that will facilitate the scientific exploration of the solar system and aid in the search for life elsewhere in the universe, and for other purposes.'' It would send a clear signal to the American people and to the world that America will be a leader in space, and that great things are to come. I thank this distinguished panel for taking the time to join us here today. I look forward to hearing their ideas about the role of humans in space exploration, and how they can fulfill that role safely. I think that H.R. 3057 is a strong start, but it will need to be refined to fit existing technology and scientific necessities. We all need to work together in this endeavor. NASA is obviously at a crossroads, and now is the time to make decisions and move forward. Chairman Boehlert. And we will go right to our very distinguished panel of witnesses: Dr. Michael D. Griffin, President and Chief Operating Officer of In-Q-Tel, Inc.; Dr. Wesley T. Huntress, Jr., Director of Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington; Dr. Matthew B. Koss, Assistant Professor of Physics, College of the Holy Cross; Dr. Alex Roland, Professor of History, Duke University; and Dr. Bruce Murray, Professor of Planetary Science and Geology Emeritus, California Institute of Technology. Let me say at the outset how much we appreciate all of you for being resources for this committee. We are here to listen. We are here to learn. We are here to have a dialogue as we develop a future vision for this important program. With that, Dr. Griffin, you are up first. And I would ask that you try to confine your opening remarks, and the Chair will not be arbitrary, to five minutes or so, which will give us ample opportunity to have the dialogue I referred to. Dr. Griffin. STATEMENT OF DR. MICHAEL D. GRIFFIN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, IN-Q-TEL, INC. Dr. Griffin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee for inviting me to appear and giving me this opportunity to discuss the vision, the goals, and the future of human space flight. I will begin at this time to discuss what we should do and not what we have done wrong. I believe that the human space flight program is, in the long run, probably the most significant activity in which our nation is engaged. For what, today, do we recall renaissance Spain, King Ferdinand, and Queen Isabella? Unless one is a professional historian, the memory which is evoked is of their sponsorship of Columbus in his voyages of discovery. For what, in 500 years, will our era be recalled? We will never know, but I believe it will be for the Apollo lunar landings, if for anything at all. And this is entirely appropriate. Human expansion into space is a continuation of the ancient human imperative to explore, to exploit, to settle new territory when and as it becomes possible to do so. This imperative will surely be satisfied, by others if not by us. It may be argued that we have many difficult problems in greater need of immediate attention and resources than is human space flight. I agree with this argument. But even recognizing this reality, space flight is sparingly funded. In round numbers, fiscal year 2003 U.S. budget outlays were approximately $2.1 trillion while the U.S. population is currently just under 300 million, yielding an average liability of $7,000 per person, or about $20 a day for every man, woman, and child in the Nation. With the NASA budget at $15 billion a year, the civil space program costs each person in the Nation about $50 a year, or less than 14 cents per day. A really robust space effort could be had for a mere 20 cents a day from each person. I spend more than that on chewing gum. We, as a nation, quite literally spend more on pizza than we do on space exploration. So I don't think we are overspending on space. As wealthy as the United States is, it is certainly true that we can allocate only a small fraction of that wealth to the development of human space flight. But, in my opinion, we must allocate that fraction and we must spend it wisely. I don't think we are doing either. I think that although there are technical challenges, they do not seem to me to be the biggest problem that we have. We did not retreat from the Moon because of technical difficulties, we have not failed to go to Mars because of technical problems, and we have not taken 20 years to put a Space Station in orbit because of technical matters. In each case, the issues are matters of politics and leadership. Without a bipartisan, leadership-driven consensus that a vigorous space exploration program is essential to America's future, we will not have such a program, whether or not there are technical challenges to be overcome. It has been 40 years since a Chief Executive has propounded such a vision and made it stick, and no Congress has ever taken the initiative to do so. If the Nation's leaders can not say that space exploration is important and why, it will not occur. ``This new ocean,'' to use John F. Kennedy's famous phrase, has recently become accessible to us, albeit at great cost and difficulty. But despite the difficulty, it will be explored and exploited, it will be settled, by humans. The only questions are: which humans and when. While the answer to the first question will eventually be all humans, I am parochial enough to believe that those from our nation should be in the vanguard. So, recognizing that others may differ, for me, the single overarching goal of the human space flight program is the human settlement of the solar system and eventually beyond. I can think of no lesser purpose sufficient to justify the difficulty of the enterprise, and no greater purpose is possible. With that, I stand ready to take your questions. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Dr. Griffin follows:] Prepared Statement of Michael D. Griffin Abstract Justification for the human space flight program is discussed in terms of the importance of U.S. leadership in this historically inevitable expansion. The need for a steady funding and a long-term commitment to the space flight enterprise is discussed. Technology hurdles and suggested intermediate milestones are identified. Mr. Chairman: Thank you for inviting me to appear before the Committee in this rare opportunity to discuss the vision, the goals, and the future of human space flight. Allow me to begin, if I might, with some ``truth in advertising.'' I am an unabashed supporter of space exploration in general, and of human space flight in particular. I believe that the human space flight program is in the long run possibly the most significant activity in which our nation is engaged. For what, today, do we recall renaissance Spain, King Ferdinand, and Queen Isabella? Unless one is a professional historian, the memory which is evoked is their sponsorship of Columbus in his voyages of discovery. For what, in five hundred years, will our era be recalled? We will never know, but I believe it will be for the Apollo lunar landings if for anything at all. And this is entirely appropriate. Human expansion into space is a continuation of the ancient human imperative to explore, to exploit, to settle new territory when and as it becomes possible to do so. This imperative will surely be satisfied, by others if not by us. We know this, if not with our logic then with our intuition. We are all the descendants of people who left known and familiar places to strike out for the risky promise of better places, in an unbroken chain going back to a small corner of east Africa. Concerning the settlement of the American West, it has been said that ``the cowards never started, and the weaklings died on the way.'' But this has been true of every human migration; we are all the descendants of those who chose to explore and to settle new lands, and who survived the experience. The late Carl Sagan, and others, have argued that this biological imperative is soundly rooted in evolutionary biology. The divergence of a species throughout the broadest possible environmental range is a form of insurance against a local catastrophe. Sagan argued that human expansion into the solar system is the important next step in protecting the human species from known and unknown catastrophes on a planetary scale. The fossil record which has been unearthed in recent decades certainly gives credence to this view, revealing evidence of multiple large scale ``extinction events'' throughout the history of life on Earth. However, to be important is not necessarily to be urgent, and it may be argued that we have many difficult problems in greater need of immediate attention and resources than is human space flight. But even recognizing this reality, space flight is sparingly funded. In round numbers, FY 2003 U.S. budget outlays were approximately $2.1 trillion, while the U.S. population is just under 300 million, yielding an average liability of $7000 per person, or about $20 per day for each man, woman, and child in the Nation. With the NASA budget at $15 B/ year, the civil space program costs each person in the Nation about $50/year, or less than 14 cents per day. A really robust space effort could be had for a mere twenty cents per day from each person! I spend more than that on chewing gum. We as a nation quite literally spend more on pizza than we do on space exploration. So I don't think we are overspending on space. As wealthy as the United States may be, it is certainly true that we can allocate only a very small fraction of that wealth to the development of human space flight. But we must allocate that fraction, and we must spend it wisely. I don't think we are doing enough of either. ``This new ocean''--to use John F. Kennedy's famous phrase--has recently become accessible to us, albeit at great cost and difficulty. But despite the difficulty, it will be explored and exploited, it will be settled, by humans. The only questions are, ``Which humans?'' and ``When?'' While the answer to the first question will eventually be ``all humans,'' I am parochial enough to believe that those from our nation should be in the vanguard. Much in the news lately is the budding Chinese space program, which came of age yesterday with its first manned launch. The United States required only eight years to progress from our first manned space flight to the first lunar landing, and that while simultaneously developing the technology to do it. A committed nation could now achieve such a goal much more expeditiously. How are we going to feel when one of the Apollo lunar landing flags is returned to Earth and displayed in a museum--in Beijing? Do we really want a world in which the human space flight programs of other nations are on the rise, while ours is in decline? We are the sole factor in determining whether such a future comes about. No other nation can surpass us in human space flight unless we allow it to happen. So, recognizing that others may differ, for me the single overarching goal of human space flight is the human settlement of the solar system, and eventually beyond. I can think of no lesser purpose sufficient to justify the difficulty of the enterprise, and no greater purpose is possible. With these thoughts in mind, I offer the following in response to the questions posed by this committee in its formal invitation to appear. What option should NASA pursue in human space flight? Accepting my premise that the proper goal of a publicly-funded space program is to enable the human settlement of the solar system, it becomes immediately clear that the relevant possibilities are few in number, and that we have not recently pursued any of them. The geography of the solar system shows us the way. Suitable and useful destinations for humans are limited in the near-term, given technologies reasonably foreseeable in the next several generations. They include the Moon, Mars, and certain near-Earth and main-belt asteroids. That's about it. Certain way-points or ``parking places''-- not physical destinations but features of the orbital geography of the solar system--are also useful, including low-Earth orbit (LEO), geostationary orbit (GEO), and possibly the lunar Lagrange points. We, and our grandchildren's grandchildren, will be fully and gainfully occupied learning to reach, survive in, and exploit these places to our benefit. It has been drolly observed that, ``if God had wanted us to have a space program, he would have given us a moon,'' and I believe the truth underlying this witticism is correct. Development of permanent lunar bases on the Moon, only three days away, will teach us much of what we need to know to press on to Mars. And in the slightly longer run, I believe the asteroids will be found to have immense value as a source of raw materials, as well as being of great scientific interest. So, to me, the proper sequence for exploration is the Moon, then Mars, and then the asteroids. It must be recognized, of course, that any such sequence is for initial program planning only. Once begun, exploration and exploitation of the Moon will continue for centuries or millennia, just as it will for Mars and beyond. The waypoints--LEO, GEO, and others--should be developed as necessary to enable the exploration of the Moon, Mars, and asteroids, and not as programmatic goals in and of themselves. For example, a LEO space station such as the present International Space Station (ISS) is of very little use in developing a lunar base, especially during the early phases of such development. Thus, in a human space flight program focused on ``settling the solar system,'' construction of a LEO space station would not be an early priority. Similarly, there has been considerable discussion concerning the utility of the lunar Lagrange points as transportation nodes for a lunar base. While I think the idea has considerable merit, it is merit that attaches mostly to the longer term, when a fairly robust space infrastructure has been put in place. In the early years, the best way to get to the Moon is as directly as possible, and similarly for Mars. What is the U.S. likely to gain by pursuing this option, and why can such gains not be obtained in other way? Specifically, please describe why these gains could not be achieved by means of unmanned missions. What are the implications of the option you suggest for the future of the unmanned program? One may search in vain for an argument justifying, in any immediate way, the danger, difficulty, and expense of human space exploration. I believe we have all heard enough about technological ``spinoffs,'' stimulating education, maintaining the high-tech industrial base, conducting astronomical or geological research, developing space-based power systems, harvesting space resources, and so on ad nauseam. Such arguments are most annoying because, while they are true--the claimed benefit does exist--they are irrelevant. No thinking individual would undertake a multi-generation program of human space flight to achieve any of these objectives, or any other similar collateral benefit. Any such goal can and should be achieved more directly and efficaciously merely by allocating to it the resources judged to be necessary for its accomplishment. We do not need a human space flight program to stimulate our children's education, or for any similar reason. A more global rationale is needed for an enterprise that will occupy our attention for generations to come. What the U.S. gains from a robust, focused program of human space exploration is the opportunity to carry the principles and values of western philosophy and culture along with the inevitable outward migration of humanity into the solar system. Is this valuable? The answer must depend on one's world view, I suppose. But consider a map of the world today, and notice the range of nations in which English is spoken as a primary language, and in which variations on British systems of justice, politics, culture, and economics thrive today. Was the centuries-long development of the British Empire, based upon Britain's primacy in the maritime arts, a misguided use of resources? I believe not. Consider also that Great Britain's influence, achieved through its mastery of the oceans, was not restricted merely to affairs in the colonies, the new lands. By virtue of its nautical superiority, Britain wielded a dominant influence in the Old World as well, an influence hugely out of proportion to its size and other resources. Can America, through its mastery of human space flight, have a similar influence on the cultures and societies of the future, those yet to evolve in the solar system as well as those here on Earth? I think so, and I think our descendants will consider it to have been worth twenty cents per day. In the process of developing and extending human space flight into the solar system, we will also collect all of the ancillary benefits mentioned above, and many more. But I cannot imagine that these benefits can be attained solely through the use of unmanned scientific and exploration spacecraft. While such efforts are incredibly valuable--and I have personally spent the majority of my career in the engineering development of unmanned space systems--it is not credible to believe that they can substitute for human presence in the larger context that I have outlined here. Perhaps the most concise rationale on this point was provided by Norm Augustine in his 1990 ``Report of the Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program.'' In that document, Mr. Augustine points out that ``there is a difference between Hillary reaching the top of Everest and merely using a rocket to loft an instrument package to the summit.'' It cannot be said better, and again, I believe this difference is worth a few cents per day. Others may differ, but that is my view. To this point, there is no inherent conflict between manned and unmanned space programs, save that deliberately promulgated by those seeking to play a difficult and ugly zero-sum game. But that is not the game at hand. In the context of a civil space program justified primarily in terms of the expansion of humanity into the solar system, it must be understood that ``primarily'' does not mean ``entirely.'' Certain unmanned space systems having little connection with human space flight will be supported--as they are today--because of their inherent scientific or utilitarian value. Who today wants to return to life without weather satellites, global navigation, instantaneous worldwide communication, or high resolution overhead imaging? Similarly, that portion of our nation's scientific research devoted to using space assets to improve our understanding of Earth's environment, our solar system, and the cosmos beyond, will always, and should always, receive due attention in the allocation of resources. I personally worked, as a much younger engineer among thousands of others, on the Hubble Space Telescope, and will always be proud of having done so. Human space flight advocates are not making a case that such programs should be deferred in favor of manned programs. On the contrary, the necessary requirements of human expansion into the solar system cannot be met without a greatly increased program of unmanned scientific exploration. This can only be seen as a ``win-win'' for all those involved in any aspect of space exploration. In the end, it comes down to letting robots and humans each do what they do best. What is your estimate of the costs of pursuing the selected option? The cost cannot be easily estimated, because the task is so open- ended. A better way to think of the space enterprise is as an investment that will yield some benefits in the near-term, but which cannot fully mature for generations. The appropriate fiscal policy for such an investment is to allocate to it an amount consistent with both its ultimate value and the sobering reality that it will be a long time before this value is returned. Our present assessment, as a nation, seems to be that the space enterprise is worth about $15 B per year, or as I indicated earlier, about 14 cents per person per day. I think we could spend a little more without wasting the money. The Nation's space program, and in particular its human space flight program, is not presently focused along the lines I have suggested here. We are burdened with a history of several decades of, in my view, misguided policy decisions, the legacy of which cannot be easily or quickly undone. For example, though I struggle to find value in the effort to match its cost, the international faith and credibility of the United States is tied, in part, to the orderly completion of the ISS. We must complete its construction, to include the original seven-man crew capability, and establish a utilization plan for the facility that returns as much value as possible. Yet, we must not mortgage our future to ISS, losing the next two decades as we have lost the last two. If no additional funding can be made available, it will be very difficult to complete ISS and, at the same time, embark on the development of those other systems that are required for a truly valuable and exciting human space flight program. I would like to see an allocation of about $20 B per year to the U.S. civil space program. This would enable us to begin crucially needed programs to develop reusable space transportation systems, heavy lift launch, crew transfer vehicles, life support technology, and space power and propulsion systems that are needed to establish bases on the Moon and Mars. How long will it take to achieve the specified goals of your option? Again, the program I have outlined is not a ``goal,'' it is a way of life, an essentially permanent part of our nation's technical, cultural, political and, yes, budgetary landscape. We will achieve important intermediate milestones, such as a return to the Moon, the first landing on Mars, and many other uplifting events. But one has only to fly over the United States from coast to coast to realize that, in a very real sense, the ``settlement'' of the America is hardly complete, even after five hundred years of European presence in the Americas. The settlement of the solar system can be expected to take a bit longer. The required time to achieve the intermediate milestones is irrevocably tied to funding constraints. If no new funding can be provided, we will spend the next several years--probably a decade-- working our way out of the Space Shuttle and International Space Station dilemmas, even proceeding as expeditiously as possible. It will be difficult, likely impossible, to begin development of (for example) heavy lift launch vehicles and space nuclear power systems while restricting NASA to today's budget levels and simultaneously respecting current obligations to ISS. Yet, these technologies and others are crucial to any permanent step beyond LEO. There is a lot of ground to be made up, but with a $5 B annual funding increase for NASA, I believe one could expect to see the first lunar base within a decade. What is needed is a different view of space flight in the affairs of men and nations than we have so far seen. Space programs in the United States have so far have been just that--programs. They are justified individually, each on its own merits, and have defined goals, funding, start dates and, it is hoped, completion dates. Space activities so far have been largely episodic, when in fact they need to become, again, a way of life. NASA and the space community generally, whether civil or DOD, receive frequent criticism for the high cost of what we do, the cumbersome pace at which it often seems to proceed, and the not infrequent failures which occur. This may not be entirely unfair; it is my own belief that the Nation is entitled to expect a higher standard of performance on space projects than has often been the case in recent years. But we in the space community--the engineers who must execute a multi-year vision one budget year at a time--are, I think, entitled to expect a higher and more consistent standard of commitment by the Nation, through its policy-makers, to that vision. As an example of the mindset I advocate, I note that the United States has a Navy, which institution in fact predates our present form of constitutional government. Even in difficult times, we do not debate whether or not the United States will continue to have a Navy. We do not debate the Navy's function; by common understanding, it is the Navy's purpose to provide mastery and control of the high seas for the benefit of the Nation. We may debate ways and means of achieving this, but withdrawal from the basic enterprise would be unthinkable. So it must be with human space flight. We are not yet to that point. What technical hurdles must be overcome in pursuing the option, and what steps that must be taken to overcome those hurdles? Are there intermediate program goals, and when might these be achieved? I will comment on specific technical issues below, but before so doing I feel compelled to note that the technical challenge does not seem to me to be the biggest problem we have. We did not retreat from the Moon because of technical difficulties, we did not fail to go to Mars because of technical problems, and we have not taken twenty years to put a space station in orbit because of technical matters. In each case the issues are matters of politics and leadership. Without a bipartisan, leadership-driven consensus that a vigorous space exploration program is essential to America's future, we will not have such a program, whether or not there are technical challenges to be overcome. It has been forty years since a Chief Executive has propounded such a vision, and no Congress has ever taken the initiative to do so. If the Nation's leaders cannot say that space exploration is important, and why, it will not occur. And technical challenges do exist. They include both human and engineering elements. We have considerable experience in the microgravity environment, and some practical and effective countermeasures have shown promise in minimizing bone loss, though more work is clearly needed. The most practical long-term microgravity countermeasure may well be to design our spaceships to supply artificial gravity by spinning them to generate a centrifugal force. Planetary surfaces are another matter. We have at present no clear understanding of how the human organism will respond and adapt to fractional gravitational environments such as will be experienced on the Moon and Mars. The most difficult issue is likely to be that of cosmic heavy-ion radiation. The human effects of and countermeasures for heavy ion radiation, encountered in deep space but not in the LEO environment of the ISS, have received little attention thus far. On the engineering side, the first order of business is largely to restore capabilities that we once had, and then to make them more reliable and cost effective. It may not be impossible to consider returning to the Moon, or going to Mars, without a robust heavy-lift launch capability, but it is certainly silly. Our last Saturn V was launched thirty years ago, and while I do not necessarily advocate resurrecting an outdated design, this is the class of capability which is needed for the human space flight enterprise. At the same time, much cargo (including humans) does not need to be launched in very large packages. We desperately need much more cost effective Earth-to-LEO transportation for payloads in the size range from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of pounds. In my judgment, this is our most pressing need, for it controls a major portion of the cost of everything else that we do in space. Yet, no active U.S. government program of which I am aware has this as its goal. As I have tried to indicate earlier, it is very difficult to comment on the nature and timing of intermediate program goals and milestones without reference to funding constraints. For interplanetary flight, something more than chemical propulsion is clearly needed for other than return to the Moon or, possibly, the first expeditions to Mars. Nuclear propulsion makes the most sense to me; several options are available, including both nuclear-thermal and nuclear-electric concepts. We once had an operating, ground-tested (though not flight-tested) nuclear-thermal upper stage intended for use on the Saturn V. The program was canceled thirty years ago, when it became clear that a Mars mission was not in the Nation's immediate future. Numerous nuclear fusion concepts potentially applicable to space propulsion exist, most notably those involving electrostatic confinement of the nuclear core, but none of these is receiving more than token funding. There also exist a number of promising approaches to electric propulsion, notably the Vasimir engine concept. In the long run, some form of nuclear-electric propulsion is likely to offer the best combination of efficiency and packaging capability for interplanetary flight. What is the implication of this option for the current human space flight program? To what degree does the current human space flight program contribute to or impede the option you suggest? What recommendations do you have for the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs? I have alluded above to some of the technical hurdles that we face in a commitment to a permanent program of human space exploration. Broadly, the tools necessary for this enterprise include: -- Heavy-lift launch capability, in the 100 metric ton to LEO class or greater. -- Reliable, efficient, and cost effective transportation to LEO for moderate size payloads. -- Compact space qualified nuclear power systems. -- Nuclear and nuclear-electric upper stage vehicles for application to interplanetary flight. -- Space and planetary surface habitat and human suit technology. -- Technology and systems for utilizing the in situ resources of the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. -- Reliable and routine Earth-to-LEO crew transfer systems. These are the things we would be working on, and would have been working on for decades, had we a consensus that the primary purpose of the Nation's human space flight program was to begin the exploration of the solar system. The fact that we are largely not allocating the human space flight portion of the NASA budget to these tasks illustrates more plainly than any rhetoric that our space flight programs are directed to no useful end. I will repeat only briefly my remarks above concerning ISS; we should do what is necessary to bring the program to an orderly completion while respecting our international partnership agreements, obtaining where possible as much scientific value as we can from the enterprise while accommodating ourselves to the fact that such value is inevitably limited. Regarding the Space Shuttle, I have previously offered my opinion to this committee that we should move to replace this system with all deliberate speed. While the Shuttle's capabilities are extensive and varied, it has proven to be extremely expensive to use, unreliable in its logistics, and operationally fragile. It is extremely risky for the crews who fly it because, while its mission reliability is no worse than other launch vehicles, there is seldom any possibility of crew escape in the event of an anomaly. The Shuttle has met none of its original goals, despite the best efforts of some of our nation's best engineers to achieve those goals. Neither NASA nor the Nation as a whole saw, or could see, these problems looking forward in 1972, when the Shuttle program was approved. But, three decades later, I think we must admit to ourselves that it is time to move on. Biography for Michael D. Griffin Michael D.

Thank you very much, Dr. Griffin. Dr. Huntress. STATEMENT OF DR. WESLEY T. HUNTRESS, JR., DIRECTOR, GEOPHYSICAL LABORATORY, CARNEGIE INSTITUTION OF WASHINGTON Dr. Huntress. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, I am grateful for this opportunity to testify before you today on my view of the future of this planet's human space flight program. I believe that the American public wants an adventurous space program to new, exciting destinations in the solar system and beyond. The challenge is to move outward beyond the Earth to these exotic places, places where we have been given tantalizing glimpses from our robotic exploration program. The Shuttle and the Space Station are the legacy of a long-past era in which the space program was a weapon in the Cold War. The Apollo program was not primarily the science or exploration program we are all fond of remembering, it was a demonstration of the power and national will intended to win over the hearts and minds around the world and to demoralize the Soviet Union. Exploration is not what motivated Kennedy to open the public purse. Beating the Russians did. Apollo accomplished that and the Nation moved on to other priorities, which did not include what the space enthusiasts and much of the public thought would happen, lunar bases or on to Mars. The imperatives are very much different today. Three decades of wishful thinking and building space ambitions on an inadequate funding basis has led us into a blind alley. The Space Station was not the expected transportation mode for missions beyond the Earth that it was supposed to be. It has become an Earth orbital end unto itself. The Space Shuttle is not the low-cost, low-risk operational space transportation system that it was su"
