        "text": "February 25, 2009\n\nAuroraMAX: New Project Puts the Northern Lights Online\n\nThe CSA, the City of Yellowknife, the University of Calgary and Astronomy North announce the creation of AuroraMAX, an online observatory and outreach project that will feature live broadcast of the northern lights from Yellowknife. This collaborative venture aims to increase an understanding of the aurora both locally and nationally.\n\nMay 13, 2009\n\nTwo New Canadian Astronauts\n\nThe Minister of Industry, the Honourable Industry Minister Tony Clement, and CSA President Steve MacLean reveal the names of Canada's newest astronauts. Jeremy Hansen and David St-Jacques are the first Canadians to join the astronaut corps since 1992.\n\nMay 14, 2009\n\nCanada Plays a Key Role in Two New Cosmic Origins Missions\n\nThe ESA's Herschel Space Observatory and Planck Space Telescope are successfully launched simultaneously at 9:12 a.m. Eastern today aboard the same Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. With funding from the CSA, four Canadian science teams provide important contributions to both satellites, considered to be two of the most ambitious missions seeking to better understand the birth of stars and the dawn of the Universe. While the Herschel and Planck satellites are two separate missions, both contribute to enhance their respective research areas in far-infrared astronomy and cosmology.\n\nMay 27, 2009\n\nSuccessful Launch: Canadian Astronaut Bob Thirsk Lifts Off for Six Months on ISS (Expedition 20/21)\n\nCSA astronaut Robert (Bob) Thirsk launched successfully from Baïkonur, Kazakhstan, aboard Soyuz TMA-15 at 6:34 a.m. (EDT), marking the start of Canada's first long-duration mission in space. Thirsk stays onboard the ISS for six months, breaking Canada's-and his own-mission-length record of 17 days. A physician and mechanical engineer, Thirsk is the mission's Crew Medical Officer, robotics specialist, and specialist for Kibo, the Japanese experimental facility.\n\nJuly 15, 2009\n\nMission STS-127: CSA astronaut Julie Payette launches successfully aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour and returns to the ISS.\n\nJuly 17, 2009\n\nShortly after the space shuttle Endeavour docked to the ISS, the hatch between the two spacecrafts was opened and the first six permanent ISS residents welcomed aboard the crew of mission STS-127. Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk (Expedition 20/21), who launched to the Station on May 27, 2009 aboard a Soyuz rocket, greeted fellow Canadian astronaut Julie Payette to his orbital home.\n\nJuly 31, 2009\n\nCanadian Astronaut Julie Payette returns to Earth\n\nCritical assembly mission ends with successful landing\n\nThe remarkably successful STS-127 mission came to an end with a picture-perfect landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, at 10:48 a.m. (EDT). The 16-day mission was a robotics-intense mission with astronauts completing the installation of the platform outside the Japanese laboratory Kibo and replacing critical equipment on the ISS. All mission objectives were accomplished and five spacewalks were performed that totalled 30 hours and 30 minutes outside. CSA astronaut Julie Payette operated three arms during the mission-the Station's Canadarm2, the Shuttle's Canadarm and the Japanese arm.\n\nSeptember 17, 2009\n\nCanadian Cosmic Catch\n\nThe CSA's Canadarm2 successfully captures the HTV free-flying Japanese vehicle--a first Canadian cosmic catch for the robotic arm on the ISS. Following this delicate capturing maneuver, CSA astronaut Robert Thirsk took over the controls of the arm and docked the spacecraft to the ISS to finalize the rendezvous.\n\nOctober 5, 2009\n\n25 years of Canadian human presence in Space\n\nOn October 5, 2009, Canada celebrates 25 years of human presence in space. A quarter of a century ago, U.S. Space Shuttle Challenger lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida with Canadian astronaut Marc Garneau aboard (STS-41-G). From October 5, 1984 to December 1st, 2009, Canadian astronauts take part in numerous scientific experiments and give a helping hand in assembling the ISS. Three Canadians perform spacewalks and Robert Thirsk breaks a Canadian record for the longest mission ever as he spends 6 months in space (Expedition 20/21). In 2009, Canada adds two new recruits to its already well respected and experienced astronaut corps.\n\nNovember 2, 2009\n\nSuccessful Launch of Canadian Technology On ESA SMOS/Proba-2 satellites\n\nTwo advanced satellites SMOS and Proba-2 are launched aboard a Russian Rockot launch vehicle. The dual launch includes a primary satellite called SMOS (Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity), developed under the ESA's Living Planet program, which observes soil moisture over the Earth's landmass and salinity over the oceans. As a secondary objective, SMOS also provide observations over snow and ice covered regions, and contributes to the study of the cryosphere. The second satellite Proba-2 (PRoject OnBoard Autonomy) is part of ESA's In-orbit Technology Demonstration Program. As a cooperating member of the ESA, Canada is an active participant in the SMOS and Proba-2 missions. The CSA's participation and funding of Earth Observation Space Technology Programs has enabled Canadian companies to actively contribute advanced technology for demonstration on these satellites. Overall, the CSA has invested approximately $7.5M in these missions. In addition, the CSA is also supporting the scientific exploitation of SMOS data through its Government Related Initiative Program.\n\nNovember 16, 2009\n\nAdvanced Plant Experiments on orbit (APEX-Cambium)\n\nCSA astronaut Robert (Bob) Thirsk begins the new Advanced Plant EXperiments on Orbit (APEX-Cambium) study, a CSA-funded project led by Canadian researcher Dr. Rodney Savidge of the University of New Brunswick. APEX-Cambium is designed to determine if reaction wood, a soft, pulpy wood that grows on the upper sides of horizontally-inclined trees on Earth, will develop in the near-weightless environment. Results will indicate if gravity is a key factor in this biological process, which could provide vital insights to the pulp & paper and construction industries, and enhance scientists' general understanding of how wood develops in trees.\n\nDecember 1, 2009\n\nCSA astronaut Robert Thirsk lands on the plains of Kazakhstan in a Russian Soyuz Capsule on December 1, 2009 after completing an exceptional 188-day mission in space, of which 186 days are spent living and working onboard the ISS (Expedition 20/21). During his stay aboard the ISS, Thirsk performs many vital science, technology, maintenance and education initiatives in support of the Canadian and international scientific communities. He is also part of the first 13-person assembly of humans in space, and welcomes his Canadian colleague Julie Payette to the station in July. Taking into account his STS-78 shuttle flight in 1996 and this first long-duration Canadian space flight, Thirsk spent a total of 206 days in space, surpassing the total number of days spent in space of all other Canadian astronauts combined, to date.\n\nJanuary 11, 2011\n\nCanadian astronomers unveil a new survey of the Universe\n\nCanadian astronomers who are members of an international team unveiled the first results produced by the Planck Space Telescope.\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Planck Space Telescope has nearly completed three of its four planned surveys of the entire sky. The goal of the Planck is to study the oldest source of light in the Universe, which will reveal more details about the formation and evolution of the Universe.\n\nThe Planck Space Telescope mission is led by the ESA, and includes contributions from the CSA. The CSA funds two Canadian research teams that are part of the Planck science collaboration, and who participated in the development of both of Planck's science instruments, the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) and the High Frequency Instrument (HFI).\n\nJanuary 17, 2011\n\nNew Canadarm Stamp\n\nThe Canadarm appears in a 2011 stamp from Canada Post that features the first Canadian handshake in space.\n\nApril 12, 2011\n\n50 Years of Human Space Flight – A World-Wide Celebration\n\nOn April 12, 2011, the CSA united with space-faring nations from around the world to celebrate a milestone in human spaceflight history, the 50th anniversary of the first human space flight with Russian Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin).\n\nApril 19, 2011\n\nCanadarm2 Turns 10: CSA Celebrates a Decade of Success\n\nApril 19, 2011 marked the tenth anniversary of Canadarm2, a 17-metre long robotic arm essential to the ISS's construction and operations.\n\nCanadarm2 was launched to the ISS on April 19, 2001, aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. A larger, more robust successor to the Shuttle's Canadarm, Canadarm2 has provided a full decade of flawless service as the Station's sophisticated \"construction crane,\" having assembled the ISS module by module in space.\n\nCanadarm2 has unloaded hundreds of tons of equipment and supplies ferried by the shuttle and assisted almost 100 spacewalks. Endeavour's last flight later the same month marked Canadarm2's 28th Shuttle mission. Additionally, the robotic arm performed two \"cosmic catches\" where it captured, docked and later released two unpiloted Japanese resupply ships (HTV-1 and HTV-2).\n\nBuilt for the CSA in Brampton, Ontario, by MDA, Canadarm2 was installed on the ISS by astronaut Chris Hadfield during the first spacewalk by a Canadian. He was assisted in this feat by NASA astronaut Scott Parazynski. In 2006, Steve MacLean became the first Canadian ever to operate Canadarm2 in space. CSA astronauts Julie Payette and Robert Thirsk are the only other Canadians to have ever operated Canadarm2 in space. The robotic arm is routinely operated by flight controllers at NASA's Johnson Space Centre and the CSA's headquarters in Longueuil, Quebec.\n\nCanadarm2's role on the ISS will expand as the orbital lab nears completion: in addition to performing routine maintenance, the robotic arm will make more frequent cosmic catches. When the Space Shuttle retires, reusable commercial spacecraft, like SpaceX's Dragon and Orbital's Cygnus, will be used to bring supplies and equipment to the ISS. Canadarm2 will capture each of these visiting vehicles, as well as the Japanese HTV transport vessels. In late 2011 and early 2012, Canadarm2 is scheduled to capture a series of 6 commercial spacecraft in just 7 months.\n\nMay 13, 2011\n\nHenry Buijs Receives Canadian Space Award\n\nOn May 13, 2011, in recognition of his exceptional contribution to the Canadian Space Program, Dr. Henry Buijs was presented with the prestigious John H. Chapman Award of Excellence at the CSA's annual celebration, in the company of representatives from industry, academia, and government as well as former and current Canadian Astronauts.\n\nAbout the John H. Chapman Award of Excellence\n\nEstablished in 2000 and presented by the CSA to distinguished members of the space community, this award celebrates a remarkable contribution to the advancement of the Canadian Space Program and a lifetime of achievement in space science and technology. The recipient of the John H. Chapman Award of Excellence is selected by a committee chaired by the Agency's President. With this award, the CSA honours John H.

MacNaughton, Larry Clarke, Gordon G. Shepherd, Colin A. Franklin, Val O'Donovan, and John S. MacDonald.\n\nJune 10, 2011\n\nCanadian Microbolometer Sensor Focusing on Oceans, Fires and Volcanoes\n\nCanada's Earth Observation Program reaches new heights with the successful launch of the 4th Argentinian Satélite de Aplicaciones Cientificas (SAC-D) aboard a Delta II rocket on June 10, 2011.\n\nThe InfraRed Sensor Technology (NIRST) instrument, jointly developed by Canada and Argentina, will be put into low Earth orbit together with seven other instruments on this five-year international partnership mission.\n\nThe NIRST instrument is designed to retrieve temperatures of the surface of the ocean and the hot spots such as forest fires and volcanic activities.\n\nThe microbolometer sensors, which are the heart of the NIRST instrument, were designed and investigated through Research and Development activities at the CSA, and subsequently microfabricated and space qualified by the Quebec-based company INO.\n\nJuly 8, 2011\n\nEnd of the Shuttle Program Final Flight of Atlantis\n\nCanada's Contribution\n\nThe final flight of the Space Shuttle Atlantis took place on July 8, 2011, at 11:26 a.m. (EDT). This was the last mission of the Space Shuttle program.\n\nAtlantis carried equipment for a joint NASA-CSA robotic refueling test. The Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) is an external ISS experiment that uses Dextre, a space robot, to demonstrate and test the tools, technologies and techniques engineers on Earth would need to robotically refuel satellites in space—even satellites not designed to be serviced. The test took place approximately six months after STS-135.\n\nCanadian content aboard Atlantis:\n\nTechnology\n\nThe TriDAR technology was further tested on board the Space Shuttle. The Triangulation and LIDAR Automated Rendezvous and Docking system provides critical guidance information that can be used to position a vehicle during rendezvous and docking operations. Unlike current technologies, TriDAR does not rely on any reference markers, such as reflectors, positioned on the target spacecraft. It counts on a laser-based 3D sensor and a thermal imager. The TriDAR technology is developed by Neptec Design group with funding from the CSA and NASA.\n\nScience\n\nThe last Canadian science experiment for the Space Shuttle, Hypersole, was designed to determine changes in human skin sensitivity before and after spaceflight, and whether these changes are related to balance control.\n\nData from Hypersole is expected to make a significant contribution to existing studies of the aging process and reductions in information relayed by skin sensors that lead to a loss of balance control and, among the elderly especially, a greater incidence of falls. The data will also provide knowledge that benefits astronauts as they perform their flight and post-flight duties.\n\nEducation\n\nSTS-135 carried tomato seeds as part of the Tomatosphere project. The seeds, sealed in a plastic bag, will be left on the ISS for up to 36 months in order to be exposed to the on-orbit environment. The tomato seeds will then be brought back to Earth and distributed to participating classrooms so that students can plant them and observe their germination rates.\n\nThis project has reached 83,285 classrooms, or approximately 2,040,000 Canadian students, since the seeds were first distributed in 2001.\n\nFast Facts\n\nThis flight marked the Canadarm's 90th mission since it first flew on Shuttle Columbia on STS-2, in 1981.\n\nCanadian astronauts have flown 14 times on the Space Shuttle.\n\nChris Hadfield and Steve MacLean are the only CSA astronauts that have flown on Shuttle Atlantis.\n\nAugust 18, 2011\n\nRADARSAT-2 data contributes to a new understanding of Antarctic terrain\n\nImagery acquired from the Canadian satellite RADARSAT-2 has enabled the landmark discoveries announced by University of California (UCI) researchers on August 18, 2011.\n\nPreviously unmapped glaciers of Antarctica have been charted by accessing imagery collected from Canadian, European and Japanese satellites. Using NASA technology, the researchers have discovered unique terrain features that indicate the direction and velocity of ice in Antarctica. This provides invaluable insight into ice melt and future sea rise due to climate change.\n\nThe full continental coverage of Antarctica was made possible due to the unique capabilities of RADARSAT-2 to image left and capture data and information over the central part of the continent. This capability allowed the capture of data over the full land mass, from South Pole to coast, imagery that is at the heart of the discovery made by the UCI researchers.\n\nThis endeavour was coordinated by the International Polar Year (IPY) Space Task Group and was only possible through the collective effort of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission Coordination Group. International contributors include the CSA, NASA, the ESA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.\n\nSeptember 8, 2011\n\nTwo New Canadian Astronauts Certified\n\nThe CSA announced on September 8, 2011 that its two new astronauts, Jeremy Hansen and David Saint-Jacques, had successfully completed their two-year basic training at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nSeptember 15, 2011\n\nCSA astronaut David Saint-Jacques Participates in NASA Undersea Mission\n\nThe CSA announced that CSA astronaut David Saint-Jacques had been assigned to his first mission. He took part in NEEMO 15 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations), in which he tested exploration concepts in an undersea environment off the Florida coast. The mission began October 17, 2011.\n\nNEEMO 15 is the first undersea mission to simulate a visit to an asteroid. Challenges relevant to exploring a gravity-weak asteroid will be undertaken, including how to anchor to the surface, how to move around and how best to collect data. The simulated exploration activities were coordinated with the \"DeepWorker\" submersibles and techniques were evaluated. The \"DeepWorker\" submersibles--one-seater submarines that act as underwater analogues for the Space Exploration Vehicle--were built and developed by Nuytco in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nNovember 12, 2011\n\nCanadarm Turns 30: CSA Salutes Three Decades of Industry Innovation\n\nCanadarm, Canada's national icon of technological innovation, was launched on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-2) on November 12, 1981. Designed to deploy and retrieve space payloads, the robotic arm quickly became a critical element in the Space Shuttle Program. It worked flawlessly for 90 Shuttle missions, spending a total of 944 days in space and travelling the equivalent of over 624 million km.\n\nSome of the Canadarm's most famous achievements include retrieving the Hubble Space Telescope for repair missions (1993-2009), connecting the two first modules of the ISS, in 1998 and inspecting the Shuttle's heat shield to ensure its safe return to Earth. The design and construction of the Canadarm marked the beginning of Canada's close collaboration with NASA in human space flight, leading to the creation of Canada's corps of astronauts.\n\nWhile the Canadarm was retired after the Space Shuttle's final flight in July 2011, the arm's legacy lives on through the suite of Canadian robots on board the ISS, as well as the innovations in robotic prototyping being done under the Next-Generation Canadarm Program. The Canadarm has also inspired several generations of scientists and engineers to develop new technologies for industry, medicine, and other applications, such as neuroArm, an ultra precise robot for neurosurgery.\n\nNovember 26, 2011\n\nThe Maple Leaf Returns to Mars: Canadian science instrument launches on board NASA's Mars Science Laboratory\n\nThe CSA is Mars bound once again with the launch of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 10:02 a.m. Eastern. Estimated Arrival on Mars: August 6, 2012. The mission carries a Canadian science instrument known as the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS), which will probe the chemistry of rocks and soils on Mars to help determine if the Red Planet ever was, or could still be today, an environment able to support microbial life.\n\nThe size of a small car, MSL's rover—named Curiosity—is a mobile geology lab equipped with the largest, most advanced suite of science instruments ever to land on Mars. Curiosity will analyze samples on site to determine whether Mars was ever a habitable planet, characterize the climate and geology of Mars, and pave the way for human exploration. APXS is one of 10 science instruments on Curiosity. It will determine the chemical composition of Martian rocks and soil samples to establish their geological history, identify possible alterations by water and perform sample triage for the on-board laboratory instruments. It will be used regularly throughout the mission, which is planned to last one full Martian year (687 Earth days).\n\nJanuary 9, 2013\n\nThe Government of Canada Launches Final Stage of RADARSAT Constellation Project\n\nThe Honourable Christian Paradis, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for the CSA, launches the next and final stage of Canada's RADARSAT Constellation project.\n\nThe RADARSAT Constellation Mission will provide complete coverage of Canada's vast land mass, oceans and coastal approaches, at least once per day, and up to four times daily in the high Arctic. Data produced by the Constellation will support key Government of Canada priorities related to: the Northern Strategy, especially in the Arctic; Defence; Safety, Sovereignty and Security; the Environment; Natural Resources; and Agriculture.\n\nThe RADARSAT Constellation Mission project is led by the CSA and supported by its principal users: the Department of National Defence, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Environment Canada, Natural Resources Canada and Public Safety Canada.\n\nJanuary 25, 2013\n\nDextre Successfully Refuels Mock Satellite and Aces a Major Test for Space Robotics\n\nDextre, the CSA's dexterous robot on board the ISS, makes space history by successfully refueling a mock satellite on the exterior of the station. Topping off the satellite's fuel tank is the pivotal task in the experimental Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM), a collaboration between the NASA and the CSA to demonstrate how robots could service and refuel satellites on location in space to extend their useful lifetime.\n\nFebruary 14, 2013\n\nThe Iconic Canadarm Embarks on Last Leg of a Storied Journey\n\nThe famed robotic arm touches down on the last flight of the Space Shuttle Endeavour in May 2011. It is then returned to Canada and undergoes a thorough and careful evaluation at MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates' facilities in Brampton, Ontario before being transferred to the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, to be displayed on a long term basis.\n\nCanadarm, Canada's national icon of technological innovation, makes its space debut on the US Space Shuttle Columbia on November 13, 1981. Designed to deploy and retrieve space payloads, the robotic arm quickly becomes a critical element in the Space Shuttle Program. It works flawlessly for 90 Shuttle missions, spending a total of 944 days in space and travelling the equivalent of over 624 million kilometres.\n\nFebruary 25, 2013\n\nSuccessful launch of the Canadian space telescope, the Near-Earth Object Surveillance Satellite (NEOSSat)\n\nNEOSSat launches from Sriharikota, India aboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket together with Department of National Defence's satellite Sapphire.\n\nKnown as Canada's \"Sentinel in the Sky\", NEOSSat is the world's first experimental microsatellite designed to detect and track space objects, debris and satellites. Funded and managed jointly by the CSA and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), NEOSSat performs multiple tasks, while carrying out two distinct missions serving the needs of the science and defence communities.\n\nThe suitcase-sized NEOSSat orbits approximately 800 kilometres above the Earth, searching for near-Earth asteroids and space objects that are difficult to spot using ground-based telescopes. Because of its location, NEOSSat is not limited by the day-night cycle and operates 24/7.\n\nMarch 3, 2013\n\nCanadarm2 Catches a Dragon Carrying Canadian Medical Technology to the Space Station\n\nWith Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield monitoring and assisting operations, ground controllers based at the CSA's headquarters and NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, use Canadarm2 to dock Dragon to the station marking the first time this delicate operation is controlled remotely from Earth.\n\nDragon also carries Microflow, the first generation of a transportable flow cytometer for use on the ISS and supplies to the ISS, including Canadian treats from several regions of the country suggested by the general public through the CSA's \"Snacks for Space\" contest.\n\nMarch 13, 2013\n\nCanadian astronaut Chris Hadfield becomes first Canadian Commander of the ISS\n\nAs Commander of Expedition 35 and chief among his new duties, Chris hadfield is responsible for any final decisions required in an emergency event. He also oversees station operations, including over 100 scientific experiments. His role as Commander ends mid-May, when he and the other members of Expedition 35 return to Earth.\n\nMarch 21, 2013\n\nPlanck space mission sheds light on the Universe's age, evolution and composition\n\nThe Planck Space Telescope delivers by far the best map ever made of the most ancient light in the Universe, showing that it is slightly older than previously thought, expanding more slowly and that there is more matter than known before. Planck includes contributions from the CSA: the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) and the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI).\n\nLed by the ESA, the Planck Space Telescope surveys the sky since launched in 2009. The telescope's incredible accuracy allows it to pinpoint faint, minute patterns—differences in light and temperature that correspond to slightly different densities in the matter left over from the Big Bang.\n\nApril 29, 2013\n\nThe Herschel Space Observatory ceases active duty\n\nAfter having exhausted its supply of liquid helium, which is required to cool the telescope's instruments to make highly precise measurements the Herschel Space Observatory ceases to function.\n\nThe Herschel Space Observatory was the largest most powerful infrared telescope ever flown in space. During its active lifespan, it made over 35,000 observations and logged more than 25,000 hours of studying the Universe, unveiled previously invisible celestial objects, and leading to new insights into the origin and evolution of stars, planets and galaxies.\n\nMay 2, 2013\n\nUnveiling of the Canadarm Exhibit\n\nUnveiling of the permanent Canadarm display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, in Ottawa. CSA astronaut Chris Hadfield assists in the inauguration of the exhibit from orbit as Commander of the ISS.\n\nAfter travelling 624 million kilometres and logging a total of 944 workdays in space aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour, the Canadarm has returned home. In close collaboration with the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, the CSA created an interactive exhibit displaying the Canadarm, which allows visitors to navigate through the history of the robotic arm, including: its greatest achievements and how its legacy continues to live on today in medical robots used in neurological and pediatric surgery.\n\nIn 2011, the Canadarm wrapped up 30 years of operations supporting the U.S. Space Shuttle Program. Working in close collaboration with NASA, the CSA negotiated the return of Endeavour's Canadarm. Upon its return, the 15-metre arm was sent first to MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) in Brampton, for a thorough evaluation and preparation for its public display.\n\nMay 9, 2013\n\nRADARSAT-1: Seventeen Years of Technological Success\n\nOn March 29, 2013, Canada's first Earth Observation satellite, RADARSAT-1, experiences a technical anomaly after surpassing its expected lifetime by 12 years. In the days since, the CSA assembled a joint CSA-industry team of engineers, who conducted an extensive investigation. Following numerous attempts to resolve the technical issue, the CSA, in consultation with its commercial distributor MDA Geospatial Services Inc. (MDA GSI) has concluded that RADARSAT-1 is no longer operational after 17 years of outstanding service.\n\nAmong its many accomplishments, RADARSAT-1 conducted Antarctic Mapping Missions (AMM) in 1999 and 2000 and delivered the first-ever, unprecedented high-resolution maps of the entire frozen continent. It also delivered the first stereo-radar coverage of the planet's landmass, the first high-resolution interferometric coverage of Canada, and produces complete single season snapshots of all the continents.\n\nMay 13, 2013\n\nCanadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield returns to Earth Following historic five-month mission\n\nCSA astronaut Chris Hadfield lands safely on the plains of Kazakhstan aboard a Russian Soyuz Capsule on May 13, 2013 at 10:31 p.m. (EDT). During his five-month mission aboard the ISS, Hadfield and the Station crew conduct over 130 science experiments, establishing a record for science conducted on the Station. In March, Hadfield achieves a historic milestone, becoming the first Canadian to command the Station.\n\nSeptember 12, 2013\n\nThe CSA and the French space agency (CNES) successfully complete their maiden stratospheric research balloon flight from Timmins, Ontario. This flight is the first to take place under a France Canada collaboration agreement signed on September 30, 2012.\n\nSeptember 29, 2013\n\nWith the launch of the hybrid small satellite CASSIOPE, Canada is making a significant contribution to unraveling the mysteries of space weather. To this end, the satellite uses a dedicated scientific payload ePOP (enhanced polar outflow probe), which observes the ionosphere. In addition, two technological advancements are supported by the mission: a new Smallsat spacecraft Bus, and a communications technology demonstrator, Cascade\n\nOctober 22, 2013\n\nCanadian Satellite SCISAT Celebrating 10 Years Of Scientific Measurements\n\nThe CSA celebrates the tenth anniversary of the SCISAT mission. Launched on August 12, 2003, SCISAT is helping a team of Canadian and international scientists improve their understanding of the depletion and recovery of the ozone layer, with a special emphasis on the changes occurring over Canada and in the Arctic.\n\nSCISAT has surpassed expectations by lasting 10 years to date. It delivers valuable data on climate change, air quality and pollution in support of international environmental policy aimed at protecting the ozone layer.\n\nNovember 7, 2013\n\nThe Bank of Canada unveils its new $5 polymer note. Included on the note are images of Canadarm2, Dextre, and the Mobile Base System, in order to highlight Canada's robotic expertise and contribution to the ISS.\n\nThe bank note also features the image of an astronaut to represent all the Canadians who have contributed to the space program.\n\nNovember 20, 2013\n\nInternational Space Station turns 15\n\nThe CSA, the ESA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and NASA celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the ISS.\n\nNovember 22, 2013\n\nSuccessful Launch of the Swarm Constellation\n\nThe ESA's first constellation of Earth Observation satellites lifts off from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia.

The CSA is funding five Canadian universities (University of Toronto, University of Guelph, University of Manitoba, Université de Sherbrooke, Université INRS-Québec) that are working on the mission under the leadership of Environment Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. SMAP measures the amount of water in the top 5 cm of soil everywhere on Earth's surface. The data improves the representation of energy, water and carbon cycles in Canadian environmental analysis and prediction systems using soil moisture and freeze/thaw data. NASA plans to release the first verified soil moisture data maps by May 2016 and verified freeze/thaw maps by July 2016.\n\nMore information about SMAP\n\nApril 14, 2015\n\nLaunch of Tomatosphere, Osteo-4 and JCAP on Dragon to the International Space Station\n\nSpaceX launches its commercial resupply ship, Dragon, to the ISS. Dragon carries 600,000 tomato seeds to the ISS on behalf of the Tomatosphere educational project, led by the University of Guelph and Let's Talk Science. Dragon also carries an upgrade to the CSA instruments for Osteo-4, an experiment which may lead to a better understanding of osteoporosis and other diseases on Earth, and advance the search for countermeasures. The improved device will eventually be returned to the CSA, allowing Canadian scientists to pursue their research on bone loss in space. In order to upgrade eOsteo, CALM Technologies subcontracted Xiphos Systems Corporation for a data processor card known as Q6 card. The DRAGON spacecraft also carries JCAP--a device built by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.--an adapter plate that will allow the Station's crew to transfer spare parts from the inside of the ISS to the exterior through a sliding table in the Japanese airlock. Once outside, replacement parts can be retrieved robotically by either Canadarm2 or Dextre, thereby reducing the need for astronauts to conduct spacewalks for routine maintenance tasks. CSA astronaut David Saint-Jacques works as lead Capcom for this flight. A Capcom acts as a bridge between the Flight Control team in Mission Control and the astronauts in space.\n\nSeptember 28, 2015\n\nASTROSAT, the Indian Space Research Organisation's first astronomy satellite, is launched. Canada contributes three sensitive detectors to the UVIT instrument, ASTROSAT's twin ultraviolet (UV) and visible imaging telescopes. The objectives of the mission include understanding high-energy activity in star systems beyond the Milky Way and surveying the sky in UV light to measure how often galaxies form new stars.\n\nDecember 6-9, 2015\n\nCosmic catch complete!\n\nCygnus lifts off on December 6 on its way to the ISS. The resupply ship arrives on December 9 and is captured by Canadarm2.\n\nThe Cygnus resupply craft carries the MARROW and Vascular Echo Canadian experiments to the ISS. Concerning MARROW: Microgravity in space, like prolonged bed rest on Earth, has negative effects on the bone marrow and the blood cells it produces. The new findings may help minimize the impact for the astronauts as well as the consequences of decreased physical activity on Earth, particularly for the rehabilitation of bedridden patients, people with limited mobility and senior citizens. Vascular Echo: Previous CSA supported research has shown that some astronauts experience accelerated arterial stiffening while in space. This ISS experiment will eventually lead to the development of procedures to slow vascular aging of the astronauts and improve health and quality of life on Earth. Cygnus also carries Kaber, a microsatellite deployer that the Canadian robot Dextre will use to launch small satellites from the Space Station.\n\nDecember 11, 2015\n\nFirst light for UVIT!\n\nThe UVIT telescope aboard ASTROSAT, the Indian Space Research Organization's space observatory, takes its first images of the sky—a cluster of stars known as NGC 188. The picture is taken using ultraviolet light, invisible from the earth, and covers a field of view some 100 times larger than the Hubble telescope.\n\nASTROSAT provides astronomers with a unique capability for science: it has several telescopes which aligned to observe the same object at the same time in multiple wavelengths (from optical to hard X-rays). Funded by the CSA, Canada provided the electronic \"eyes\" for UVIT to see in ultraviolet light. Canadian astronomers will have access to 5% of ASTROSAT's observation time, which includes all the instruments, as well as participation in the UVIT team observing program.\n\nDecember 17, 2015\n\nCanadian-built laser mapping system takes aim at an asteroid\n\nThe CSA delivers its contribution to NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission: the Canadian-built OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter (OLA).\n\nOSIRIS-REx will study Bennu, an asteroid that has the potential to impact the Earth in the late 2100s. It is Canada's first international mission to return a sample from an asteroid to Earth."
