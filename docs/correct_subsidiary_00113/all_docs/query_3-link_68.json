Even though the mission experienced a few issues, the operation to fix it marks one of the most successful robotic space rescues in the history of space exploration.\n\nPARKER SOLAR PROBE\n\nAugust 12, 2018\n\nNASA's Parker Solar Probe is planning to fly more than seven times closer to the Sun’s surface than any other spacecraft and revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. During its 7-year mission, Parker will perform scientific investigations in a hazardous region of intense heat and solar radiation to watch the solar wind speed up from subsonic to supersonic and fly though the birthplace of the highest-energy solar particles.\n\nSTEREO\n\nSolar Terrestrial Relations Observatory\n\nOctober 26, 2006\n\nSTEREO is composed of two nearly identical observatories -- one ahead of Earth in its orbit, the other trailing behind, and has traced the flow of energy and matter from the Sun to Earth. This mission is key to NASA’s space weather detection efforts and provides more accurate alerts for the arrival time of Earth-directed solar ejections with its unique side-viewing perspective.\n\nBEPICOLOMBO\n\nOctober 20, 2018\n\nBepiColombo is a joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to the planet Mercury. The main objectives of the mission are to study the origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star, study Mercury's form, interior, structure, geology, composition and craters and investigate Mercury's exosphere, composition and dynamics, including generation and escape.\n\nMESSENGER\n\nMercury Surface, Space Environment,\n\nGeochemistry and Ranging\n\nAugust 3, 2004\n\nMESSENGER was the seventh Discovery-class mission, and the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury.

The facility contains a Z-tower with multiple print heads and a bioreactor on the X-Y print stage. Once printed, cells are conditioned and matured into tissue in the Redwire ADSEP payload.\n\nAMF\n\nAdditive Manufacturing Facility\n\nThe Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF) is the first permanent commercial manufacturing platform to operate in low Earth orbit. AMF is our flagship technology onboard the ISS and its versatility and durability have made it a reliable resource for government and commercial customers since its activation in 2016. It has produced over 200 tools, assets, and parts in orbit. AMF’s legacy has been the foundation for our technology roadmap and manufacturing programs as Redwire develops new capabilities that will leverage additive manufacturing in space for unprecedented applications.\n\nADSEP\n\nAdvanced Space Experiment Processor\n\nADSEP is a fully automated, multi-use single middeck locker processing facility used to conduct a variety of life and physical-science research and small-batch production.

After orbiting Bennu for nearly two years, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft successfully made sample collections from the asteroid using a robotic arm.\n\nStardust\n\nFebruary 7, 1999\n\nThe primary objective of the Discovery class Stardust mission was to fly by the comet P/Wild 2 and collect samples of dust and volatiles from the coma of the comet. It then returned these samples to Earth for detailed study in 2006.\n\nGalileo\n\nOctober 18, 1989\n\nGalileo orbited Jupiter for almost eight years and made close passes by all its major moons. Its camera and nine other instruments sent back reports that allowed scientists to determine, among other things, that Jupiter’s icy moon Europa probably has a subsurface ocean with more water than the total amount found on Earth.\n\nJuno\n\nAugust 5, 2011\n\nWith its suite of science instruments, Juno will investigate the existence of a solid planetary core, map Jupiter's intense magnetic field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere, and observe the planet's auroras. The mission will help scientists how giant planets form and the role these titans played in putting together the rest of the solar system.\n\nCassini-Huygens\n\nOctober 15, 1997\n\nThe Cassini mission, a joint endeavor of NASA, ESA (the European Space Agency), and the Italian space agency (ASI), was a sophisticated robotic spacecraft sent to study Saturn and its complex system of rings and moons in unprecedented detail. Cassini carried a passenger to the Saturn system, the European Huygens probe; the first human-made object to land on a world in the distant outer solar system.\n\nNew Horizons\n\nJanuary 19, 2006\n\nThe New Horizons mission to Pluto flew by the dwarf planet and its moon Charon on its journey, capturing previously unseen images of the surface, before continuing to the Kuiper Belt. The spacecraft's extreme distance from Earth makes it only the fifth to venture so far from home, the others being Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, and Voyager 1 and Voyager 2."
