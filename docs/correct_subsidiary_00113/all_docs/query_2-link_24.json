The continued quest for detailed topographic measurements of Venus will again be undertaken in April 1989 by Magellan, named after the 16th century Portuguese explorer. Magellan will orbit Venus about once every three hours, acquiring radar data for 37 minutes of each orbit when it is closest to the surface. Using an advanced instrument called a synthetic aperature radar (SAR), it will map more than 90 per cent of the surface with resolution ten times better than the best prior spacecraft.

Mission success is the prime motivator for building spacecraft with fault tolerant systems. The Magellan spacecraft had many such requirements imposed upon its design. Magellan met these requirements by building redundancy into all the major subsystem components and designing the onboard hardware and software with the capability to detect a fault, isolate it to a component, and issue commands to achieve a back-up configuration. This discussion is limited to fault protection, which is the autonomous capability to respond to a fault. The Magellan fault protection design is discussed, as well as the developmental and flight experiences and a summary of the lessons learned.\n\nArtist concept of Magellan spacecraft above Venusian surface\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1988-01-01\n\nArtist concept shows Magellan spacecraft in cruise configuration oriented above Venusian surface, during data collection and radar mapping sequence.

Magellan mapped 98 percent of Venus' surface at a resolution of 100 to 150 meters (about the length of a football or soccer field), using synthetic aperture radar, a technique that simulates the use of a much larger radar antenna. It found that 85 percent of the surface is covered with volcanic flows and showed evidence of tectonic movement, turbulent surface winds, lava channels and pancake-shaped domes. Magellan also produced high-resolution gravity data for 95 percent of the planet and tested a new maneuvering technique called aerobraking, using atmospheric drag to adjust its orbit. The spacecraft was commanded to plunge into Venus' atmosphere in 1994 as part of a final experiment to gather atmospheric data. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA18175\n\nMagellan Prelaunch Mission Operations Report\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe Magellan spacecraft will be launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) within a 31-day overall launch period extending from April 28 to May 28, 1989. The launch will use the Shuttle Orbiter Atlantis to lift an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) and the Magellan Spacecraft into low Earth orbit. After the Shuttle achieves its parking orbit, the IUS and attached Magellan spacecraft are deployed from the payload bay. After a short coast time, the two-stage IUS is fired to inject the Magellan spacecraft into an Earth-Venus transfer trajectory. The Magellan spacecraft is powered by single degree of freedom, sun-tracking, solar panels charging a set of nickel-cadmium batteries. The spacecraft is three-axis stabilized by reaction wheels using gyros and a star sensor for attitude reference. The spacecraft carries a solid rocket motor for Venus Orbit Insertion (VOI). A hydrazine propulsion system allows trajectory correction and prevents saturation of the reaction wheels. Communication with Earth through the Deep Space Network (DSN) is provided by S- and X-band telemetry channels, through alternatively a low, medium, or 3.7 m high-gain parabolic antenna rigidly attached to the spacecraft. The high-gain antenna also serves as the radar and radiometer antenna during orbit around Venus.\n\nPrecise Tracking of the Magellan and Pioneer Venus Orbiters by Same-Beam Interferometry. Part 2: Orbit Determination Analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFolkner, W. M.; Border, J. S.; Nandi, S.; Zukor, K. S.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nA new radio metric positioning technique has demonstrated improved orbit determination accuracy for the Magellan and Pioneer Venus Orbiter orbiters. The new technique, known as Same-Beam Interferometry (SBI), is applicable to the positioning of multiple planetary rovers, landers, and orbiters which may simultaneously be observed in the same beamwidth of Earth-based radio antennas. Measurements of carrier phase are differenced between spacecraft and between receiving stations to determine the plane-of-sky components of the separation vector(s) between the spacecraft. The SBI measurements complement the information contained in line-of-sight Doppler measurements, leading to improved orbit determination accuracy. Orbit determination solutions have been obtained for a number of 48-hour data arcs using combinations of Doppler, differenced-Doppler, and SBI data acquired in the spring of 1991. Orbit determination accuracy is assessed by comparing orbit solutions from adjacent data arcs. The orbit solution differences are shown to agree with expected orbit determination uncertainties. The results from this demonstration show that the orbit determination accuracy for Magellan obtained by using Doppler plus SBI data is better than the accuracy achieved using Doppler plus differenced-Doppler by a factor of four and better than the accuracy achieved using only Doppler by a factor of eighteen. The orbit determination accuracy for Pioneer Venus Orbiter using Doppler plus SBI data is better than the accuracy using only Doppler data by 30 percent.\n\nAerobraking Magellan\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLyons, Daniel T.; Sjogren, William; Johnson, William T. K.; Schmitt, Durwin; Mcronald, Angus\n\n1992-01-01\n\nWhile the Magellan spacecraft is currently in an elliptical orbit around Venus, its orbit may be circularized by means of an aerobraking maneuver during which a minor amount of aerodynamic drag is applied to 1000-2000 orbits. An evaluation is presently undertaken of the thermal-control and operational problems arising from such a maneuver, in virtue of its not having been considered among the design requirements of the spacecraft. Attention is given to atmospheric erosion and contamination problems to which the spacecraft surfaces could be exposed.\n\nMagellan aerobrake navigation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiorgini, Jon; Wong, S. Kuen; You, Tung-Han; Chadbourne, Pam; Lim, Lily\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe Magellan spacecraft has been aerobraked into a 197 x 541 km near-circular orbit around Venus from which it is conducting a high-resolution gravity mapping mission. This was the first interplanetary aerobrake maneuver and involved flying the spacecraft through the upper reaches of the Venusian atmosphere 730 times over a 70 day period. Round-trip light-time varied from 9.57 to 18.83 minutes during this period. Navigation for this dynamic phase of the Magellan mission was planned and executed in the face of budget-driven down-sizing with all spacecraft safe modes disabled and a flight-team one-third the size of comparable interplanetary missions. Successful execution of this manuever using spacecraft hardware not designed to operate in a planetary atmosphere, demonstrated a practical cost-saving technique for both large and small future interplanetary missions.\n\nMagellan attitude control mission operations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDukes, Eileen M.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nFrom the Martin Marietta Astronautics Group base in Denver, Colorado, spacecraft engineers have been operating the Magellan spacecraft for the past three and one half years, along with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, for NASA. The spacecraft team in Denver is responsible for the health of the vehicle, from command generation to evaluation of engineering telemetry. Operation of the spacecraft's Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) has specifically posed several in-flight challenges. This system must provide accurate pointing of the spacecraft throughout each 3.2 hour orbit which typically consists of 5 - 9 discrete maneuvers. Preparation of bi-weekly command sequences, monitoring execution, and trending of subsystem performance is of paramount importance, but in-flight anomalies have also demanded the attention of AACS engineers. Anomalies are often very interesting and challenging aspects of a project, and the Magellan mission was no exception. From the first unsuccessful attempts to perform a starscan, to spacecraft safing events, much has been experienced to add to the `lessons learned' from this mission. Many of Magellan's in-flight experiences, anomalies, and their resolutions are highlighted in this paper.\n\nMagellan attitude control mission operations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDukes, Eileen M.\n\nFrom the Martin Marietta Astronautics Group base in Denver, Colorado, spacecraft engineers have been operating the Magellan spacecraft for the past three and one half years, along with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, for NASA.

Scientific highlights include the history of U.S. and Soviet missions, as well as ground-based radar observations, that have provided the current knowledge about the surface of Venus. Descriptions of the major Venusian surface features include controversial theories about the origin of some of the features. The organization of the Magellan science investigators into discipline-related task groups for data-analysis purposes is presented. The design of the Magellan spacecraft and the ability of its radar sensor to conduct radar imaging, altimetry, and radiometry measurements are discussed. Other topics report on the May 1989 launch, the interplanetary cruise, the Venus orbit-insertion maneuver, and the in-orbit mapping strategy. The objectives of a possible extended mission emphasize the gravity experiment and explain why high-resolution gravity data cannot be acquired during the primary mission. A focus on the people of Magellan reveals how they fly the spacecraft and prepare for major mission events. Special items of interest associated with the Magellan mission are contained in windows interspersed throughout the text. Finally, short summaries describe the major objectives and schedules for several exciting space missions planned to take us into the 21st century.\n\nMagellan Final Science Reports\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nThompson, Thomas W.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis volume is a brief summary of the scientific results of the Magellan Venus mapping mission as reported by the Magellan science investigators. Magellan has exceeded all of its mission objectives by obtaining high resolution radar images, surface elevation, and radiometry for more than 98% of the planet. The amount of stereo data gathered on Venus is more than that available for any other planet. Magellan's fourth cycle collected gravity data from an elliptical orbit to provide information on the relationships between surface features and the interior of the planet. With the successful completion of the aerobraking experiment, the spacecraft, in its lower orbit around Venus, has captured high resolution gravity near the poles from the nearly circular orbit. Every attempt has been made to provide useful documentation for the complete Magellan data set. Magellan data have been released to the public through the Planetary Data System (PDS) and the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) in photographs, lithos, brochures, digital form, and compact discs. With the release of Magellan data on the compact disc read-only-memory (CD-ROM) a revolutionary new way of doing science has resulted. This technology provides a way to store, distribute and access large volumes of data. The Magellan science investigators have utilized this wealth of data to provide answers to questions we have been asking for a long time. I would like to personally thank everyone on the Magellan team for the success of this important mission, a mission that has revealed information that will help us to better understand our own Planet Earth.\n\nMagellan: The unveiling of Venus\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the United States and the Soviet Union sent the Pioneer Venus and Venera spacecraft, respectively, to study Venus more closely and to image its surface with radar. These missions have answered many questions about Venus, but many more questions remain unanswered about the extent to which Venus' surface was shaped by volcanoes, plate tectonics, impact craters, and water and wind erosion. To help answer these remaining questions a new radar imaging spacecraft Magellan will be launched from the Space Shuttle. Magellan will spend eight months mapping most of the planet at a resolution nearly ten times better than any previous views of the surface. The mission of Magellan, the radar equipment, orbiting of Venus, planetary imaging, and surface exploration are discussed.\n\nRadio occultation studies of the Venus atmosphere with the Magellan spacecraft. 2: Results from the October 1991 experiments\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJenkins, Jon M.; Steffes, Paul G.; Hinson, David P.; Twicken, Joseph D.; Tyler, G. Leonard\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOn October 5 and 6, 1991, three dual-frequency ingress radio occultation experiments were conducted at Venus during consecutive orbits of the Magellan spacecraft. The radio signals probed a region of the atmosphere near 65 deg N, with a solar zenith angle of 108 deg, reaching below 35 km at 3.6 cm, and below 34 km at 13 cm (above a mean radius of 6052 km). The high effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the Magellan spacecraft and highly successful attitude maneuvers allowed these signals to probe deeper than any previous radio occultation experiment and also resulted in the most accurate thermal and sulfuric acid vapor abundance profiles ever obtained at Venus through radio occultation techniques. The performance of the spacecraft and the experiment design are discussed in an accompanying paper. Average electron density profiles retrieved from the data possess peaks between 2600 and 6000/cu cm, well below typical values of 10,000/cu cm retrieved in 1979 by Pioneer Venus at similar solar zenith angles. Other basic results include vertical profiles of temperature, pressure, and density in the neutral atmosphere, 13- and 3.6-cm absorpttivity, and H2SO4 (g) abundance below the main cloud layer. H2SO4 (g) becomes significant below 50 km, reaching peaks between 18 and 24 ppm near 39 km before dropping precipitously below 38 km. These sharp decreases confirm the thermal decomposition of sulfuric acid vapor below 39 km. Since the Venus atmosphere rotated approximately 10 deg between experiments, the data contain information about the horizontal variability of the atmosphere. All derived profiles exhibit significant variations from orbit to orbit, indicating the presence of dynamical processes between 33 and 200 km. In particular, the orbit-to-orbit variations in temperature and in H2SO4 (g) abundance appear to be correlated, suggesting that a common mechanism may be responsible for the observed spatial variations.\n\nMagellan project\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nScott, J. F.; Griffith, D. G.; Gunn, J. M.; Piereson, R. G.; Stewart, J. M.; Tavormina, A. M.; Thompson, T. W.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe Magellan spacecraft was placed into orbit around Venus on 10 Aug. 1990 and started radar data acquisition on 15 Sep. 1990. Since then, Magellan has completed mapping over 2.75 rotations of the planet (as of mid-July 1992). Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), altimetry, and radiometry observations have covered 84 percent of the surface during the first mission cycle from mid-Sep. 1990 through mid-May 1991. Operations in the second mission cycle from mid-May 1991 through mid-Jan. 1992 emphasized filling the larger gaps (the south polar region and a superior conjunction) from that first cycle. Planned observations in the fourth mission cycle from mid-Sep. 1992 through mid-May 1993 will emphasize high-resolution gravity observations of the equatorial regions of Venus.\n\nSTS-30 Magellan spacecraft processing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) SAEF-2\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1988-10-08\n\nS89-25281 (8 Oct 1988) --- The Magellan spacecraft is hoisted from the transport trailer of the Payload Environmental Transportation System (PETS) to the floor of the cleanroom in the SAEF-2 planetary checkout facility at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC).

Panels are not fully extended in this frame. The spacecraft had earlier been released by the STS-30 crewmembers to begin its long journey to the planet Venus for an extensive radar mapping mission. The frame was photographed through Atlantis? aft flight deck windows with a handheld 70mm camera. The complementary photograph is STS030-71-070.\n\nSpace Shuttle to deploy Magellan planetary science mission\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe objectives of Space Shuttle Mission STS-30 are described along with major flight activities, prelaunch and launch operations, trajectory sequence of events, and landing and post-landing operations. The primary objective of STS-30 is to successfully deploy the Magellan spacecraft into low earth orbit. Following deployment, Magellan will be propelled to its Venus trajectory by an Inertial Upper Stage booster. The objectives of the Magellan mission are to obtain radar images of more than 70 percent of Venus' surface, a near-global topographic map, and near-global gravity field data. Secondary STS-30 payloads include the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA) and the Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE).\n\nOn-orbit spacecraft reliability\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBloomquist, C.; Demars, D.; Graham, W.; Henmi, P.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nOperational and historic data for 350 spacecraft from 52 U.S. space programs were analyzed for on-orbit reliability. Failure rates estimates are made for on-orbit operation of spacecraft subsystems, components, and piece parts, as well as estimates of failure probability for the same elements during launch. Confidence intervals for both parameters are also given. The results indicate that: (1) the success of spacecraft operation is only slightly affected by most reported incidents of anomalous behavior; (2) the occurrence of the majority of anomalous incidents could have been prevented piror to launch; (3) no detrimental effect of spacecraft dormancy is evident; (4) cycled components in general are not demonstrably less reliable than uncycled components; and (5) application of product assurance elements is conductive to spacecraft success.\n\nIUS with Magellan spacecraft drifts into space after STS-30 deployment\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1989-05-04\n\nSTS030-71-070 (4 May 1989) --- This scene is one of two released by NASA showing the process of solar array panel deployment on the Magellan spacecraft.

A major technical issue in this proposal is the design of the periapse altitude corridor. Aerobraking would cause a number of significant side effects on both the spacecraft and ground system. Heating and aerodynamic torques on the spacecraft are key issues, as are the corridor control maneuver frequency and aerobrake duration. Spacecraft and ground systems operational limits have been identified in an attempt to constrain the corridor design. A simulation program has been developed to model the aerobraking corridor control process. This paper presents study results using this program which relate to the feasibility of this aerobraking concept.\n\nSTS-30 Magellan spacecraft is unpacked at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) SAEF-2\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAt the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) inside the Space Assembly and Encapsulation Facility 2 (SAEF-2) (planetary checkout facility), the cover of the Payload Environmental Transportation System (PETS) is removed so that the Magellan spacecraft can be hoisted from the PETS trailer to the clean room floor. Clean-suited technicians guide the cover above plastic-wrapped spacecraft using rope.

Thesis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCroom, Christopher A.; Tolson, Robert H.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nResults are presented of the study of the Venusian atmosphere, Magellan aerodynamic moment coefficients, moments of inertia, and solar moment coefficients. This investigation is based upon the use of attitude control data in the form of reaction wheel speeds from the Magellan spacecraft. As the spacecraft enters the upper atmosphere of Venus, measurable torques are experienced due to aerodynamic effects. Solar and gravity gradient effects also cause additional torques throughout the orbit. In order to maintain an inertially fixed attitude, the control system counteracts these torques by changing the angular rates of three reaction wheels. Model reaction wheel speeds are compared to observed Magellan reaction wheel speeds through a differential correction procedure. This method determines aerodynamic, atmospheric, solar pressure, and mass moment of inertia parameters. Atmospheric measurements include both base densities and scale heights. Atmospheric base density results confirm natural variability as measured by the standard orbital decay method. Potential inconsistencies in free molecular aerodynamic moment coefficients are identified. Moments of inertia are determined with a precision better than 1 percent of the largest principal moment of inertia.\n\nSTS-30 Magellan spacecraft arrives at KSC after six-day journey from Colorado\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe Payload Environmental Transportation System (PETS) (semi-truck and trailer), which transported the Magellan spacecraft on its six-day journey from Martin Marietta in Denver, Colorado, to Kennedy Space Center (KSC), arrives safely at the Space Assembly and Encapsulation Facility 2 (SAEF-2) planetary checkout facility.

As a result, not much attention has been given to other tasks that can become tedious, repetitive, and error prone. One such task is Spacecraft and Memory State Tracking, the process by which the status of critical spacecraft components, parameters, and the contents of on-board memory are managed on the ground to maintain knowledge of spacecraft and memory states for future testing, anomaly investigation, and on-board memory reconstruction. The task of Spacecraft and Memory State Tracking has traditionally been a manual task allocated to Mission Operations Procedures. During nominal Mission Operations this job is tedious and error prone. Because the task is not complex and can be accomplished manually, the worth of a sophisticated software tool is often questioned. However, in the event of an anomaly which alters spacecraft components autonomously or a memory anomaly such as a corrupt memory or flight software error, an accurate ground image that can be reconstructed quickly is a priceless commodity. This study explores the process of Spacecraft and Memory State Tracking used by the Magellan Spacecraft Team highlighting its strengths as well as identifying lessons learned during the primary and extended missions, two memory anomalies, and other hardships encountered due to incomplete knowledge of spacecraft states. Ideas for future state tracking tools that require minimal user interaction and are integrated into the Ground Data System will also be discussed.\n\nMagellan spacecraft and memory state tracking: Lessons learned, future thoughts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBucher, Allen W.\n\n1993-03-01\n\nNumerous studies have been dedicated to improving the two main elements of Spacecraft Mission Operations: Command and Telemetry.

One such task is Spacecraft and Memory State Tracking, the process by which the status of critical spacecraft components, parameters, and the contents of on-board memory are managed on the ground to maintain knowledge of spacecraft and memory states for future testing, anomaly investigation, and on-board memory reconstruction. The task of Spacecraft and Memory State Tracking has traditionally been a manual task allocated to Mission Operations Procedures. During nominal Mission Operations this job is tedious and error prone. Because the task is not complex and can be accomplished manually, the worth of a sophisticated software tool is often questioned. However, in the event of an anomaly which alters spacecraft components autonomously or a memory anomaly such as a corrupt memory or flight software error, an accurate ground image that can be reconstructed quickly is a priceless commodity. This study explores the process of Spacecraft and Memory State Tracking used by the Magellan Spacecraft Team highlighting its strengths as well as identifying lessons learned during the primary and extended missions, two memory anomalies, and other hardships encountered due to incomplete knowledge of spacecraft states. Ideas for future state tracking tools that require minimal user interaction and are integrated into the Ground Data System will also be discussed.\n\nRevealing the face of Venus: Magellan\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAn overview of the Magellan spacecraft and mission is presented.

Because of the need to operate in orbit around Venus, the solar intensity requirement ranged up to 2.3 suns or Earth equivalent solar constants. Extensive modification to the solar simulator portion of the test facility were required to achieve this solar intensity. Venus albedo and infrared emission were simulated using temperature controlled movable louver panels to allow the spacecraft to view either a selectable temperature black heat source with closed louvers, or the chamber coldwall behind open louvers. The test conditions included widely varying solar intensities, multiple sun angles, alternate hardware configurations, steady state and transient cases, and cruise and orbital power profiles. Margin testing was also performed, wherein supplemental heaters were mounted to internal thermal blankets to verify spacecraft performance at higher than expected temperatures. The test was successful, uncovering some spacecraft anomalies and verifying the thermal design. The test support equipment experienced some anomalous behavior and a significant failure during the test.\n\nSoviet Soyuz spacecraft in orbit as seen from American Apollo spacecraft\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1975-07-17\n\nAST-01-053 (17-19 July 1975) --- The Soviet Soyuz spacecraft is contrasted against a black-sky background in this photograph taken in Earth orbit.

These EOS Spacecraft will be part of the NASA Mission to Planet Earth. This paper specifically addresses the EOS AM Spacecraft, referred to as 'AM' because it has a sun-synchronous orbit with a 10:30 AM descending node. This paper describes the EOS AM Spacecraft mission orbit requirements, orbit determination, orbit control, and navigation system impact on earth based pointing. The EOS AM Spacecraft will be the first spacecraft to use the TDRSS Onboard Navigation System (TONS) as the primary means of navigation. TONS flight software will process one-way forward Doppler measurements taken during scheduled TDRSS contacts. An extended Kalman filter will estimate spacecraft position, velocity, drag coefficient correction, and ultrastable master oscillator frequency bias and drift. The TONS baseline algorithms, software, and hardware implementation are described in this paper. TONS integration into the EOS AM Spacecraft Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) System; TONS assisted onboard time maintenance; and the TONS Ground Support System (TGSS) are also addressed.\n\nA Jupiter Orbiter mother/daughter spacecraft concept\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDuxbury, J.

The mother is a close derivative of the three-axis stabilized Mariner Jupiter Saturn 1977 spacecraft with the addition of a Viking-type propulsion module for orbit capture; it concentrates on the planetology and satellite science objectives. The daughter is a small, simple spin-stabilized spacecraft taking advantage of the mother's transit and delivery capabilities; it obtains in-situ measurements of the surrounding planetary environment.

That course required students to design an Alternative Manned Spacecraft (AMS) to augment or replace the Space Transportation System and meet the following design requirements: (1) launch on the Taurus Booster being developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation; (2) 99.9 percent assured crew survival rate; (3) technology cutoff data of 1 Jan. 1991; (4) compatibility with current space administration infrastructure; and (5) first flight by May 1995. The Taurus LMS design meets the above requirements and represents an initial step towards larger and more complex spacecraft. The Taurus LMS has a very limited application when compared to the Space Shuttle, but it demonstrates that the U.S. can have a safe, reliable, and low cost space system. The Taurus LMS is a short mission duration spacecraft designed to place one man into low earth orbit (LEO). The driving factor for this design was the low payload carrying capabilities of the Taurus Booster--1300 kg to a 300 km orbit. The Taurus LMS design is divided into six major design sections. The human factors system deals with the problems of life support and spacecraft cooling. The propulsion section contains the abort system, the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), the Reaction Control System (RCS), and power generation. The thermal protection systems and spacecraft structure are contained in the structures section. The avionics section includes navigation, attitude determination, data processing, communication systems, and sensors. The mission analysis section was responsible for ground processing and spacecraft astrodynamics.

OLMC enables modeling of variances of key physical parameters that affect orbital lifetimes through the use of probability distributions. These parameters include altitude, speed, and flight-path angle at insertion into orbit; solar flux; and launch delays. The products of OLMC are predicted lifetimes (durations above specified minimum altitudes) for the number of user-specified cases. Histograms generated from such predictions can be used to determine the probabilities that spacecraft will satisfy lifetime requirements. The document discusses uncertainties that affect modeling of orbital lifetimes. Issues of repeatability, smoothness of distributions, and code run time are considered for the purpose of establishing values of code-specific parameters and number of Monte Carlo runs. Results from test cases are interpreted as demonstrating that solar-flux predictions are primary sources of variations in predicted lifetimes. Therefore, it is concluded, multiple sets of predictions should be utilized to fully characterize the lifetime range of a spacecraft.\n\nExtensive Radiation Shielding Analysis for Different Spacecraft Orbits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃay, YiÇ§it; Kaymaz, Zerefsan\n\n2016-07-01\n\nRadiation environment around Earth poses a great danger for spacecraft and causes immature de-orbiting or loss of the spacecraft in near Earth space environment. In this study, a student project has been designed to build a CubeSat, PolarBeeSail (PBS), with an orbit having inclination of 80Â°, 4 Re in perigee and 20 Re in apogee to study the polar magnetospheric environment. An extensive radiation dose analyses were carried out for PBS orbit, and integral and differential fluxes were calculated using SPENVIS tools. A shielding analysis was performed and an optimum Aluminum thickness, 3 mm, was obtained. These results for PBS were then compared for other orbits at different altitudes both for polar and equatorial orbits. For this purpose, orbital characteristics of POES-19 and GOES-15 were used. The resulting proton flux analyses, TID analyses, and further shielding studies were conducted; comparisons and recommendations were made for future design of spacecraft that will use these environments.\n\nAerobraking at Venus and Mars: A Comparison of the Magellan and Mars Global Surveyor Aerobraking Phases\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLyons, Daniel T.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nOn February 4, 1999 the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft became the second spacecraft to successfully aerobrake into a nearly circular orbit about another planet. This paper will highlight some of the similarities and differences between the aerobraking phases of this mission and the first mission to use aerobraking, the Magellan mission to Venus. Although the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft was designed for aerobraking and the Magellan spacecraft was not, aerobraking MGS was a much more challenging task than aerobraking Magellan, primarily because the spacecraft was damaged during the initial deployment of the solar panels. The MGS aerobraking phase had to be completely redesigned to minimize the bending moment acting on a broken yoke connecting one of the solar panels to the spacecraft. Even if the MGS spacecraft was undamaged, aerobraking at Mars was more challenging than aerobraking at Venus for several reasons. First, Mars is subject to dust storms, which can significantly change the temperature of the atmosphere due to increased solar heating in the low and middle altitudes (below 50 km), which in turn can significantly increase the density at the aerobraking altitudes (above 100 km). During the first part of the MGS aerobraking phase, a regional dust storm was observed to have a significant and very rapid effect on the entire atmosphere of Mars. Computer simulations of global dust storms on Mars indicate that even larger density increases are possible than those observed during the MGS aerobraking phases. For many aerobraking missions, the duration of the aerobraking phase must be kept as short as possible to minimize the total mission cost. For Mars missions, a short aerobraking phase means that there will be less margin to accommodate atmospheric variability, so the operations team must be ready to propulsively raise periapsis by tens of kilometers on very short notice. This issue was less of a concern on Venus, where the thick lower atmosphere and\n\nGlobal view of Venus from Magellan, Pioneer, and Venera data\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1991-10-29\n\nThis global view of Venus, centered at 270 degrees east longitude, is a compilation of data from several sources. Magellan synthetic aperature radar mosaics from the first cycle of Magellan mapping are mapped onto a computer-simulated globe to create the image. Data gaps are filled with Pioneer-Venus orbiter data, or a constant mid-range value. Simulated color is used to enhance small-scale structure. The simulated hues are based on color images recorded by the Soviet Venera 13 and 14 spacecraft. The image was produced at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Multimission Image Processing Laboratory and is a single frame from a video released at the JPL news conference, 10-29-91.

Included are detailed descriptions and classifications of over 600 anomalies; each anomalous incident represents one reported deviation from expected spacecraft performance. Charts depicting satellite lifetimes and the performance of their major subsystems are included. Engineering analyses to further investigate the kinds and frequencies of various classes of anomalies have been conducted. An improved method for charting spacecraft capability as a function of time on orbit is explored.\n\nIllumination from space with orbiting solar-reflector spacecraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCanady, J. E., Jr.; Allen, J. L., Jr.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe feasibility of using orbiting mirrors to reflect sunlight to Earth for several illumination applications is studied. A constellation of sixteen 1 km solar reflector spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit can illuminate a region 333 km in diameter to 8 lux, which is brighter than most existing expressway lighting systems. This constellation can serve one region all night long or can provide illumination during mornings and evenings to five regions across the United States. Preliminary cost estimates indicate such an endeavor is economically feasible. The studies also explain how two solar reflectors can illuminate the in-orbit nighttime operations of Space Shuttle. An unfurlable, 1 km diameter solar reflector spacecraft design concept was derived. This spacecraft can be packaged in the Space, Shuttle, transported to low Earth orbit, unfurled, and solar sailed to operational orbits up to geosynchronous. The necessary technical studies and improvements in technology are described, and potential environmental concerns are discussed.\n\nShort- and Long-Term Propagation of Spacecraft Orbits\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmith, John C., Jr.; Sweetser, Theodore; Chung, Min-Kun; Yen, Chen-Wan L.; Roncoli, Ralph B.; Kwok, Johnny H.; Vincent, Mark A.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe Planetary Observer Planning Software (POPS) comprises four computer programs for use in designing orbits of spacecraft about planets. These programs are the Planetary Observer High Precision Orbit Propagator (POHOP), the Planetary Observer Long-Term Orbit Predictor (POLOP), the Planetary Observer Post Processor (POPP), and the Planetary Observer Plotting (POPLOT) program. POHOP and POLOP integrate the equations of motion to propagate an initial set of classical orbit elements to a future epoch. POHOP models shortterm (one revolution) orbital motion; POLOP averages out the short-term behavior but requires far less processing time than do older programs that perform long-term orbit propagations. POPP postprocesses the spacecraft ephemeris created by POHOP or POLOP (or optionally can use a less accurate internal ephemeris) to search for trajectory-related geometric events including, for example, rising or setting of a spacecraft as observed from a ground site. For each such event, POPP puts out such user-specified data as the time, elevation, and azimuth. POPLOT is a graphics program that plots data generated by POPP. POPLOT can plot orbit ground tracks on a world map and can produce a variety of summaries and generic ordinate-vs.-abscissa plots of any POPP data.\n\nSpacecraft Orbit Anomaly Representation Using Thrust-Fourier-Coefficients with Orbit Determination Toolbox\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKo, H.; Scheeres, D.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nRepresenting spacecraft orbit anomalies between two separate states is a challenging but an important problem in achieving space situational awareness for an active spacecraft. Incorporation of such a capability could play an essential role in analyzing satellite behaviors as well as trajectory estimation of the space object. A general way to deal with the anomaly problem is to add an estimated perturbing acceleration such as dynamic model compensation (DMC) into an orbit determination process based on pre- and post-anomaly tracking data. It is a time-consuming numerical process to find valid coefficients to compensate for unknown dynamics for the anomaly. Even if the orbit determination filter with DMC can crudely estimate an unknown acceleration, this approach does not consider any fundamental element of the unknown dynamics for a given anomaly. In this paper, a new way of representing a spacecraft anomaly using an interpolation technique with the Thrust-Fourier-Coefficients (TFCs) is introduced and several anomaly cases are studied using this interpolation method. It provides a very efficient way of reconstructing the fundamental elements of the dynamics for a given spacecraft anomaly. Any maneuver performed by a satellite transitioning between two arbitrary orbital states can be represented as an equivalent maneuver using an interpolation technique with the TFCs. Given unconnected orbit states between two epochs due to a spacecraft anomaly, it is possible to obtain a unique control law using the TFCs that is able to generate the desired secular behavior for the given orbital changes. This interpolation technique can capture the fundamental elements of combined unmodeled anomaly events. The interpolated orbit trajectory, using the TFCs compensating for a given anomaly, can be used to improve the quality of orbit fits through the anomaly period and therefore help to obtain a good orbit determination solution after the anomaly.

R.; Border, J. S.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of the Magellan spacecraft's angular position and velocity were made during July through September, 1989, during the spacecraft's heliocentric flight to Venus. The purpose of this data acquisition and reduction was to verify this data type for operational use before Magellan is inserted into Venus orbit, in August, 1990. The accuracy of these measurements are shown to be within 20 nanoradians in angular position, and within 5 picoradians/sec in angular velocity. The media effects and their calibrations are quantified; the wet fluctuating troposphere is the dominant source of measurement error for angular velocity. The charged particle effect is completely calibrated with S- and X-Band dual-frequency calibrations. Increasing the accuracy of the Earth platform model parameters, by using VLBI-derived tracking station locations consistent with the planetary ephemeris frame, and by including high frequency Earth tidal terms in the Earth rotation model, add a few nanoradians improvement to the angular position measurements. Angular velocity measurements were insensitive to these Earth platform modelling improvements.\n\nSpacecraft Charging in Geostationary Transfer Orbit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParker, Linda Neergaard; Minow, Joseph I.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe 700 km x 5.8 Re orbit of the two Van Allen Probes spacecraft provide a unique opportunity to investigate spacecraft charging in geostationary transfer orbits. We use records from the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) plasma spectrometer to identify candidate surface charging events based on the \"ion line\" charging signature in the ion records. We summarize the energetic particle environment and the conditions necessary for charging to occur in this environment. We discuss the altitude, duration, and magnitude of events observed in the Van Allen Probes from the beginning of the mission to present time. In addition, we explore what information the dual satellites provide on the spatial and temporal variations in the charging environments.\n\nOrbit Determination of Spacecraft in Earth-Moon L1 and L2 Libration Point Orbits\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWoodard, Mark; Cosgrove, Daniel; Morinelli, Patrick; Marchese, Jeff; Owens, Brandon; Folta, David\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe ARTEMIS mission, part of the THEMIS extended mission, is the first to fly spacecraft in the Earth-Moon Lissajous regions. In 2009, two of the five THEMIS spacecraft were redeployed from Earth-centered orbits to arrive in Earth-Moon Lissajous orbits in late 2010. Starting in August 2010, the ARTEMIS P1 spacecraft executed numerous stationkeeping maneuvers, initially maintaining a lunar L2 Lissajous orbit before transitioning into a lunar L1 orbit. The ARTEMIS P2 spacecraft entered a L1 Lissajous orbit in October 2010. In April 2011, both ARTEMIS spacecraft will suspend Lissajous stationkeeping and will be maneuvered into lunar orbits. The success of the ARTEMIS mission has allowed the science team to gather unprecedented magnetospheric measurements in the lunar Lissajous regions. In order to effectively perform lunar Lissajous stationkeeping maneuvers, the ARTEMIS operations team has provided orbit determination solutions with typical accuracies on the order of 0.1 km in position and 0.1 cm/s in velocity. The ARTEMIS team utilizes the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS), using a batch least squares method, to process range and Doppler tracking measurements from the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN), Berkeley Ground Station (BGS), Merritt Island (MILA) station, and United Space Network (USN). The team has also investigated processing of the same tracking data measurements using the Orbit Determination Tool Kit (ODTK) software, which uses an extended Kalman filter and recursive smoother to estimate the orbit. The orbit determination results from each of these methods will be presented and we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages associated with using each method in the lunar Lissajous regions. Orbit determination accuracy is dependent on both the quality and quantity of tracking measurements, fidelity of the orbit force models, and the estimation techniques used. Prior to Lissajous operations, the team determined the appropriate quantity of tracking\n\nBackgrounds, radiation damage, and spacecraft orbits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrant, Catherine E.; Miller, Eric D.; Bautz, Mark W.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe scientific utility of any space-based observatory can be limited by the on-orbit charged particle background and the radiation-induced damage. All existing and proposed missions have had to make choices about orbit selection, trading off the radiation environment against other factors. We present simulations from ESAâs SPace ENVironment Information System (SPENVIS) of the radiation environment for spacecraft in a variety of orbits, from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at multiple inclinations to High Earth Orbit (HEO) to Earth-Sun L2 orbit. We summarize how different orbits change the charged particle background and the radiation damage to the instrument. We also discuss the limitations of SPENVIS simulations, particularly outside the Earthâs trapped radiation and point to new resources attempting to address those limitations.\n\nExtreme Spacecraft Charging in Polar Low Earth Orbit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nColson, Andrew D.; Minow, Joseph I.; NeergaardParker, Linda\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSpacecraft in low altitude, high inclination (including sun-synchronous) orbits are widely used for remote sensing of the Earth's land surface and oceans, monitoring weather and climate, communications, scientific studies of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, and a variety of other scientific, commercial, and military applications. These systems episodically charge to frame potentials in the kilovolt range when exposed to space weather environments characterized by a high flux of energetic (10 s kilovolt) electrons in regions of low background plasma density which is similar in some ways to the space weather conditions in geostationary orbit responsible for spacecraft charging to kilovolt levels. We first review the physics of space environment interactions with spacecraft materials that control auroral charging rates and the anticipated maximum potentials that should be observed on spacecraft surfaces during disturbed space weather conditions. We then describe how the theoretical values compare to the observational history of extreme charging in auroral environments. Finally, a set of extreme DMSP charging events are described varying in maximum negative frame potential from 0.6 kV to 2 kV, focusing on the characteristics of the charging events that are of importance both to the space system designer and to spacecraft operators. The goal of the presentation is to bridge the gap between scientific studies of auroral charging and the need for engineering teams to understand how space weather impacts both spacecraft design and operations for vehicles on orbital trajectories that traverse auroral charging environments.\n\nMagellan: Radar performance and data products\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nPettengill, G.H.; Ford, P.G.; Johnson, W.T.K.; Raney, R.K.; Soderblom, L.A.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe Magellan Venus orbiter carries only one scientific instrument: a 12.6-centimeter-wavelength radar system shared among three data-taking modes. The syntheticaperture mode images radar echoes from the Venus surface at a resolution of between 120 and 300 meters, depending on spacecraft altitude. In the altimetric mode, relative height measurement accuracies may approach 5 meters, depending on the terrain's roughness, although orbital uncertainties place a floor of about 50 meters on the absolute uncertainty. In areas of extremely rough topography, accuracy is limited by the inherent line-of-sight radar resolution of about 88 meters. The maximum elevation observed to date, corresponding to a planetary radius of 6062 kilometers, lies within Maxwell Mons. When used as a thermal emission radiometer, the system can determine surface emissivities to an absolute accuracy of about 0.02. Mosaicked and archival digital data products will be released in compact disk (CDROM) format.\n\nNASA's Orbital Debris Optical and IR Ground-based Observing Program: Utilizing the MCAT, UKIRT, and Magellan Telescopes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLederer, S.; Cowardin, H.; Buckalew, B.; Frith, J.; Hickson, P.; Pace, L.; Matney, M.; Anz-Meador, P.; Seitzer, P.; Stansbery, E.; Glesne, T.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nCharacterizing debris in Earth-orbit has become increasingly important as the growing population of debris poses greater threats to active satellites each year. Currently, the Joint Space Operations is tracking > 23,000 objects ranging in size from 1-meter and larger in Geosychronous orbits (GEO) to 10-cm and larger at low-Earth orbits (LEO). Model estimates suggest that there are hundreds of thousands of pieces of spacecraft debris larger than 10 cm currently in orbit around the Earth. With such a small fraction of the total population being tracked, and new break-ups occurring from LEO to GEO, new assets, techniques, and approaches for characterizing this debris are needed. With this in mind, NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office has actively tasked a suite of telescopes around the world. In 2015, the newly-built 1.3m optical Meter Class Autonomous Telescope (MCAT) came on-line on Ascension Island and is now being commissioned. MCAT is designed to track Earth-orbiting objects above 200km, conduct surveys at GEO, and work with a co-located Raven-class commercial-off-the-shelf system, a 0.4m telescope with a field-of-view similar to MCAT's and research-grade instrumentation designed to complement MCAT. The 3.8m infrared UKIRT telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii has been heavily tasked to collect data on individual targets and in survey modes to study both the general GEO population and a break-up event. Data collected include photometry and spectroscopy in the near-Infrared (0.85 - 2.5Î¼m) and the mid-infrared (8-16Î¼m). Finally, the 6.5-m Baade Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile was used to collect optical photometric survey data in October 2015 of two GEO Titan transtage breakups, focusing on locations of possible debris concentrations as indicated by the NASA standard break-up model.\n\nMeteoroids and Orbital Debris: Effects on Spacecraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBelk, Cynthia A.; Robinson, Jennifer H.; Alexander, Margaret B.; Cooke, William J.; Pavelitz, Steven D.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe natural space environment is characterized by many complex and subtle phenomena hostile to spacecraft. The effects of these phenomena impact spacecraft design, development, and operations. Space systems become increasingly susceptible to the space environment as use of composite materials and smaller, faster electronics increases. This trend makes an understanding of the natural space environment essential to accomplish overall mission objectives, especially in the current climate of better/cheaper/faster. Meteoroids are naturally occurring phenomena in the natural space environment. Orbital debris is manmade space litter accumulated in Earth orbit from the exploration of space. Descriptions are presented of orbital debris source, distribution, size, lifetime, and mitigation measures. This primer is one in a series of NASA Reference Publications currently being developed by the Electromagnetics and Aerospace Environments Branch, Systems Analysis and Integration Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nExtreme Spacecraft Charging in Polar Low Earth Orbit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nColson, Andrew D.; Minow, Joseph I.; Parker, L.

In the traditional approach, the propellant is carried on board in the form of material fuel. This approach has the drawback of being limited in Delta v by the amount of fuel launched with the craft, a limit that does not scale well to high Delta v due to the massive nature of the fuel. Directed energy photon propulsion solves this problem by eliminating the need for on-board fuel storage. We discuss our system which uses a phased array of lasers to propel the spacecraft which contributes no mass to the spacecraft beyond that of the reflector, enabling a prolonged acceleration and much higher final speeds. This paper compares the effectiveness of such a system for propelling spacecraft into interplanetary and interstellar space across various laser and sail configurations. Simulated parameters include laser power, optics size and orbit as well as payload mass, reflector size and the trajectory of the spacecraft. As one example, a 70 GW laser with 10 km optics could propel a 1 kg craft past Neptune (~30 au) in 5 days at 4% the speed of light, or a 1 g \"wafer-sat\" past Mars (~0.5 au) in 20 minutes at 21% the speed of light. However, even lasers down to 2 kW power and 1 m optics show noticeable effect on gram-class payloads, boosting their altitude in low Earth orbits by several kilometers per day which is already sufficient to be of practical use.\n\nRisk Analysis of On-Orbit Spacecraft Refueling Concepts\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCirillo, William M.; Stromgren, Chel; Cates, Grant R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nOn-orbit refueling of spacecraft has been proposed as an alternative to the exclusive use of Heavy-lift Launch Vehicles to enable human exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In these scenarios, beyond LEO spacecraft are launched dry (without propellant) or partially dry into orbit, using smaller or fewer element launch vehicles. Propellant is then launched into LEO on separate launch vehicles and transferred to the spacecraft. Refueling concepts are potentially attractive because they reduce the maximum individual payload that must be placed in Earth orbit. However, these types of approaches add significant complexity to mission operations and introduce more uncertainty and opportunities for failure to the mission. In order to evaluate these complex scenarios, the authors developed a Monte Carlo based discrete-event model that simulates the operational risks involved with such strategies, including launch processing delays, transportation system failures, and onorbit element lifetimes. This paper describes the methodology used to simulate the mission risks for refueling concepts, the strategies that were evaluated, and the results of the investigation. The results of the investigation show that scenarios that employ refueling concepts will likely have to include long launch and assembly timelines, as well as the use of spare tanker launch vehicles, in order to achieve high levels of mission success through Trans Lunar Injection.\n\nTechnologies for Refueling Spacecraft On-Orbit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChato, David J.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses the current technologies for on-orbit refueling of spacecraft. The findings of 55 references are reviewed and summarized. Highlights include: (1) the Russian Progress system used by the International Space Station; (2) a flight demonstration of superfluid helium transfer; and (3) ground tests of large cryogenic systems. Key technologies discussed include vapor free liquid outflow, control of fluid inflow to prevent liquid venting, and quick disconnects for on-orbit mating of transfer lines.\n\nLunar shadow eclipse prediction models for the Earth orbiting spacecraft: Comparison and application to LEO and GEO spacecrafts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSrivastava, Vineet K.; Kumar, Jai; Kulshrestha, Shivali; Srivastava, Ashutosh; Bhaskar, M. K.; Kushvah, Badam Singh; Shiggavi, Prakash; Vallado, David A.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nA solar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned in such a way that shadow of the Moon falls on the Earth. The Moon's shadow also falls on the Earth orbiting spacecraft. In this case, the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and spacecraft is similar to that of the Sun, Moon, and Earth but this phenomenon is often referred as a lunar eclipse falling on the spacecraft. Lunar eclipse is not as regular in terms of times of occurrence, duration, and depth as the Earth shadow eclipse and number of its occurrence per orbital location per year ranges from zero to four with an average of two per year; a spacecraft may experience two to three lunar eclipses within a twenty-four hour period [2]. These lunar eclipses can cause severe spacecraft operational problems. This paper describes two lunar shadow eclipse prediction models using a projection map approach and a line of intersection method by extending the Earth shadow eclipse models described by Srivastava et al. [10,11] for the Earth orbiting spacecraft. The attractive feature of both models is that they are much easier to implement. Both mathematical models have been simulated for two Indian low Earth orbiting spacecrafts: Oceansat-2, Saral-1, and two geostationary spacecrafts: GSAT-10, INSAT-4CR. Results obtained by the models compare well with lunar shadow model given by Escobal and Robertson [12], and high fidelity commercial software package, Systems Tool Kit (STK) of AGI.\n\nMagellan mission summary\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSaunders, R. S.; Spear, A. J.; Allin, P. C.; Austin, R. S.; Berman, A. L.; Chandlee, R. C.; Clark, J.; Decharon, A. V.; De Jong, E. M.; Griffith, D. G.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nMagellan started mapping the planet Venus on September 15, 1990, and after one cycle (one Venus day or 243 earth days) had mapped 84 percent of the planet's surface. This returned an image data volume greater than all past planetary missions combined. Spacecraft problems were experienced in flight. Changes in operational procedures and reprogramming of onboard computers minimized the amount of mapping data lost. Magellan data processing is the largest planetary image-processing challenge to date. Compilation of global maps of tectonic and volcanic features, as well as impact craters and related phenomena and surface processes related to wind, weathering, and mass wasting, has begun. The Magellan project is now in an extended mission phase, with plans for additional cycles out to 1995. The Magellan project will fill in mapping gaps, obtain a global gravity data set between mid-September 1992 and May 1993, acquire images at different view angles, and look for changes on the surface from one cycle to another caused by surface activity such as volcanism, faulting, or wind activity.\n\nUsing SFOC to fly the Magellan Venus mapping mission\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBucher, Allen W.; Leonard, Robert E., Jr.; Short, Owen G.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nTraditionally, spacecraft flight operations at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have been performed by teams of spacecraft experts utilizing ground software designed specifically for the current mission. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory set out to reduce the cost of spacecraft mission operations by designing ground data processing software that could be used by multiple spacecraft missions, either sequentially or concurrently. The Space Flight Operations Center (SFOC) System was developed to provide the ground data system capabilities needed to monitor several spacecraft simultaneously and provide enough flexibility to meet the specific needs of individual projects. The Magellan Spacecraft Team utilizes the SFOC hardware and software designed for engineering telemetry analysis, both real-time and non-real-time. The flexibility of the SFOC System has allowed the spacecraft team to integrate their own tools with SFOC tools to perform the tasks required to operate a spacecraft mission. This paper describes how the Magellan Spacecraft Team is utilizing the SFOC System in conjunction with their own software tools to perform the required tasks of spacecraft event monitoring as well as engineering data analysis and trending.\n\nGraphical techniques to assist in pointing and control studies of orbiting spacecraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHowell, L. W.; Ruf, J. H.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nComputer generated graphics are developed to assist in the modeling and assessment of pointing and control systems of orbiting spacecraft. Three-dimensional diagrams are constructed of the Earth and of geometrical models which resemble the spacecraft of interest. Orbital positioning of the spacecraft model relative to the Earth and the orbital ground track are then displayed. A star data base is also available which may be used for telescope pointing and star tracker field-of-views to visually assist in spacecraft pointing and control studies. A geometrical model of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is constructed and placed in Earth orbit to demonstrate the use of these programs. Simulated star patterns are then displayed corresponding to the primary mirror's FOV and the telescope's star trackers for various telescope orientations with respect to the celestial sphere.\n\nVulnerability of manned spacecraft to crew loss from orbital debris penetration\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWilliamsen, J. E.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOrbital debris growth threatens the survival of spacecraft systems from impact-induced failures. Whereas the probability of debris impact and spacecraft penetration may currently be calculated, another parameter of great interest to safety engineers is the probability that debris penetration will cause actual spacecraft or crew loss. Quantifying the likelihood of crew loss following a penetration allows spacecraft designers to identify those design features and crew operational protocols that offer the highest improvement in crew safety for available resources. Within this study, a manned spacecraft crew survivability (MSCSurv) computer model is developed that quantifies the conditional probability of losing one or more crew members, P(sub loss/pen), following the remote likelihood of an orbital debris penetration into an eight module space station. Contributions to P(sub loss/pen) are quantified from three significant penetration-induced hazards: pressure wall rupture (explosive decompression), fragment-induced injury, and 'slow' depressurization. Sensitivity analyses are performed using alternate assumptions for hazard-generating functions, crew vulnerability thresholds, and selected spacecraft design and crew operations parameters. These results are then used to recommend modifications to the spacecraft design and expected crew operations that quantitatively increase crew safety from orbital debris impacts.\n\nPractical method to identify orbital anomaly as spacecraft breakup in the geostationary region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHanada, Toshiya; Uetsuhara, Masahiko; Nakaniwa, Yoshitaka\n\n2012-07-01\n\nIdentifying a spacecraft breakup is an essential issue to define the current orbital debris environment. This paper proposes a practical method to identify an orbital anomaly, which appears as a significant discontinuity in the observation data, as a spacecraft breakup. The proposed method is applicable to orbital anomalies in the geostationary region. Long-term orbital evolutions of breakup fragments may conclude that their orbital planes will converge into several corresponding regions in inertial space even if the breakup epoch is not specified. This empirical method combines the aforementioned conclusion with the search strategy developed at Kyushu University, which can identify origins of observed objects as fragments released from a specified spacecraft. This practical method starts with selecting a spacecraft that experienced an orbital anomaly, and formulates a hypothesis to generate fragments from the anomaly. Then, the search strategy is applied to predict the behavior of groups of fragments hypothetically generated. Outcome of this predictive analysis specifies effectively when, where and how we should conduct optical measurements using ground-based telescopes. Objects detected based on the outcome are supposed to be from the anomaly, so that we can confirm the anomaly as a spacecraft breakup to release the detected objects. This paper also demonstrates observation planning for a spacecraft anomaly in the geostationary region.\n\nConceptual design of a two stage to orbit spacecraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nArmiger, Scott C.; Kwarta, Jennifer S.; Horsley, Kevin B.; Snow, Glenn A.; Koe, Eric C.; Single, Thomas G.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThis project, undertaken through the Advanced Space Design Program, developed a 'Conceptual Design of a Two Stage To Orbit Spacecraft (TSTO).' The design developed utilizes a combination of air breathing and rocket propulsion systems and is fully reusable, with horizontal takeoff and landing capability. The orbiter is carried in an aerodynamically designed bay in the aft section of the booster vehicle to the staging altitude. This TSTO Spacecraft design meets the requirements of replacing the aging Space Shuttle system with a more easily maintained vehicle with more flexible mission capability.\n\nMagellan Project: Evolving enhanced operations efficiency to maximize science value\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCheuvront, Allan R.; Neuman, James C.; Mckinney, J. Franklin\n\n1994-01-01\n\nMagellan has been one of NASA's most successful spacecraft, returning more science data than all planetary spacecraft combined. The Magellan Spacecraft Team (SCT) has maximized the science return with innovative operational techniques to overcome anomalies and to perform activities for which the spacecraft was not designed. Commanding the spacecraft was originally time consuming because the standard development process was envisioned as manual tasks. The Program understood that reducing mission operations costs were essential for an extended mission. Management created an environment which encouraged automation of routine tasks, allowing staff reduction while maximizing the science data returned. Data analysis and trending, command preparation, and command reviews are some of the tasks that were automated. The SCT has accommodated personnel reductions by improving operations efficiency while returning the maximum science data possible.\n\nThe cartography of Venus with Magellan data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKirk, R. L.; Morgan, H. F.; Russell, J. F.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nMaps of Venus based on Magellan data are being compiled at 1:50,000,000, 1:5,000,000 and 1:1,500,000 scales. Topographic contour lines based on radar altimetry data are overprinted on the image maps, along with feature nomenclature. Map controls are based on existing knowledge of the spacecraft orbit; photogrammetric triangulation, a traditional basis for geodetic control for bodies where framing cameras were used, is not feasible with the radar images of Venus. Preliminary synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image maps have some data gaps and cosmetic inconsistencies, which will be corrected on final compilations. Eventual revision of geodetic controls and of the adopted Venusian spin-axis location will result in geometric adjustments, particularly on large-scale maps.\n\nSpacecraft on-orbit deployment anomalies - What can be done?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFreeman, Michael T.\n\n1993-04-01\n\nModern communications satellites rely heavily upon deployable appendage (i.e. solar arrays, communications antennas, etc.) to perform vital functions that enable the spacecraft to effectively conduct mission objectives. Communications and telemetry antennas provide the radiofrequency link between the spacecraft and the earth ground station, permitting data to be transmitted and received from the satellite. Solar arrays serve as the principle source of electrical energy to the satellite, and recharge internal batteries during operation. However, since satellites cannot carry backup systems, if a solar array fails to deploy, the mission is lost. This article examines the subject of on-orbit anomalies related to the deployment of spacecraft appendage, and possible causes of such failures. Topics discussed shall include mechanical launch loading, on-orbit thermal and solar concerns, reliability of spacecraft pyrotechnics, and practical limitations of ground-based deployment testing. Of particular significance, the article will feature an in-depth look at the lessons learned from the successful recovery of the Telesat Canada Anik-E2 satellite in 1991.\n\nPassive radiative cooling of a HTS coil for attitude orbit control in micro-spacecraft\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nInamori, Takaya; Ozaki, Naoya; Saisutjarit, Phongsatorn; Ohsaki, Hiroyuki\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThis paper proposes a novel radiative cooling system for a high temperature superconducting (HTS) coil for an attitude orbit control system in nano- and micro-spacecraft missions. These days, nano-spacecraft (1-10 kg) and micro-spacecraft (10-100 kg) provide space access to a broader range of spacecraft developers and attract interest as space development applications. In planetary and high earth orbits, most previous standard-size spacecraft used thrusters for their attitude and orbit control, which are not available for nano- and micro-spacecraft missions because of the strict power consumption, space, and weight constraints. This paper considers orbit and attitude control methods that use a superconducting coil, which interacts with on-orbit space plasmas and creates a propulsion force. Because these spacecraft cannot use an active cooling system for the superconducting coil because of their mass and power consumption constraints, this paper proposes the utilization of a passive radiative cooling system, in which the superconducting coil is thermally connected to the 3 K cosmic background radiation of deep space, insulated from the heat generation using magnetic holders, and shielded from the sun. With this proposed cooling system, the HTS coil is cooled to 60 K in interplanetary orbits. Because the system does not use refrigerators for its cooling system, the spacecraft can achieve an HTS coil with low power consumption, small mass, and low cost.\n\nGenerating Animated Displays of Spacecraft Orbits\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCandey, Robert M.; Chimiak, Reine A.; Harris, Bernard T.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTool for Interactive Plotting, Sonification, and 3D Orbit Display (TIPSOD) is a computer program for generating interactive, animated, four-dimensional (space and time) displays of spacecraft orbits. TIPSOD utilizes the programming interface of the Satellite Situation Center Web (SSCWeb) services to communicate with the SSC logic and database by use of the open protocols of the Internet. TIPSOD is implemented in Java 3D and effects an extension of the preexisting SSCWeb two-dimensional static graphical displays of orbits. Orbits can be displayed in any or all of the following seven reference systems: true-of-date (an inertial system), J2000 (another inertial system), geographic, geomagnetic, geocentric solar ecliptic, geocentric solar magnetospheric, and solar magnetic. In addition to orbits, TIPSOD computes and displays Sibeck's magnetopause and Fairfield's bow-shock surfaces. TIPSOD can be used by the scientific community as a means of projection or interpretation. It also has potential as an educational tool.\n\nSensor On-orbit Calibration and Characterization Using Spacecraft Maneuvers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nXiong, X.; Butler, Jim; Barnes, W. L.; Guenther, B.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nSpacecraft flight operations often require activities that involve different kinds of maneuvers for orbital adjustments (pitch, yaw, and roll). Different maneuvers, when properly planned and scheduled, can also be applied to support and/or to perform on-board sensor calibration and characterization. This paper uses MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) as an example to illustrate applications of spacecraft maneuvers for Earth-observing sensors on-orbit calibration and characterization. MODIS is one of the key instruments for NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) currently operated on-board the EOS Terra and Aqua spacecraft launched in December 1999 and May 2002, respectively. Since their launch, both Terra and Aqua spacecraft have made a number of maneuvers, specially the yaw and roll maneuvers, to support the MODIS on-orbit calibration and characterization. For both Terra and Aqua MODIS, near-monthly spacecraft roll maneuvers are executed for lunar observations. These maneuvers are carefully scheduled so that the lunar phase angles are nearly identical for each sensor's lunar observations. The lunar observations are used to track MODIS reflective solar bands (RSB) calibration stability and to inter-compare Terra and Aqua MODIS RSB calibration consistency. To date, two sets of yaw maneuvers (each consists of two series of 8 consecutive yaws) by the Terra spacecraft and one set by the Aqua spacecraft have been performed to validate MODIS solar diffuser (SD) bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) and to derive SD screen transmission. Terra spacecraft pitch maneuvers, first made on March 26, 2003 and the second on April 14, 2003 (with the Moon in the spacecraft nadir view), have been applied to characterize MODIS thermal emissive bands (TEB) response versus scan angle (RVS). This is particularly important since the pre-launch TEB RSV measurements made by the sensor vendor were not successful. Terra MODIS TEB RVS obtained from pitch maneuvers have been\n\nSpacecraft Robustness to Orbital Debris: Guidelines & Recommendations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHeinrich, S.; Legloire, D.; Tromba, A.; Tholot, M.; Nold, O.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe ever increasing number of orbital debris has already led the space community to implement guidelines and requirements for \"cleaner\" and \"safer\" space operations as non-debris generating missions and end of mission disposal in order to get preserved orbits rid of space junks. It is nowadays well-known that man-made orbital debris impacts are now a higher threat than natural micro-meteoroids and that recent events intentionally or accidentally generated so many new debris that may initiate a cascade chain effect known as \"the Kessler Syndrome\" potentially jeopardizing the useful orbits.The main recommendations on satellite design is to demonstrate an acceptable Probability of Non-Penetration (PNP) with regard to small population (<5cm) of MMOD (Micro-Meteoroids and Orbital Debris). Compliance implies to think about spacecraft robustness as redundancies, segregations and shielding devices (as implemented in crewed missions but in a more complex mass - cost - criticality trade- off). Consequently the need is non-only to demonstrate the PNP compliance requirement but also the PNF (probability of Non-Failure) per impact location on all parts of the vehicle and investigate the probabilities for the different fatal scenarios: loss of mission, loss of spacecraft (space environment critical) and spacecraft fragmentation (space environment catastrophic).The recent THALES experience known on ESA Sentinel-3, of increasing need of robustness has led the ALTRAN company to initiate an internal innovative working group on those topics which conclusions may be attractive for their prime manufacturer customers.The intention of this paper is to present a status of this study : * Regulations, requirements and tools available * Detailed FMECA studies dedicated specifically to the MMOD risks with the introduction of new of probability and criticality classification scales. * Examples of design risks assessment with regard to the specific MMOD impact risks. * Lessons learnt on\n\nOrbital spacecraft consumables resupply\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDominick, Sam M.; Eberhardt, Ralph N.; Tracey, Thomas R.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe capability to replenish spacecraft, satellites, and laboratories on-orbit with consumable fluids provides significant increases in their cost and operational effectiveness. Tanker systems to perform on-orbit fluid resupply must be flexible enough to operate from the Space Transportation System (STS), Space Station, or the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV), and to accommodate launch from both the Shuttle and Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV's). Resupply systems for storable monopropellant hydrazine and bipropellants, and water have been developed. These studies have concluded that designing tankers capable of launch on both the Shuttle and ELV's was feasible and desirable. Design modifications and interfaces for an ELV launch of the tanker systems were identified. Additionally, it was determined that modularization of the tanker subsystems was necessary to provide the most versatile tanker and most efficient approach for use at the Space Station. The need to develop an automatic umbilical mating mechanism, capable of performing both docking and coupler mating functions was identified. Preliminary requirements for such a mechanism were defined. The study resulted in a modular tanker capable of resupplying monopropellants, bipropellants, and water with a single design.\n\nThree-dimensional perspective views of Venusian Terrains composed of reduced resolution left-looking synthetic-aperture radar images merged with altimetry data from the Magellan spacecraft.\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1998-06-03\n\nThe view from NASA's Magellan spacecraft shows most of Galindo V-40 quadrangle looking east; Atete Corona, in the foreground, is a 600-km-long and about 450-km-wide, circular volcano-tectonic feature. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00096\n\nOptimal Lorentz-augmented spacecraft formation flying in elliptic orbits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, Xu; Yan, Ye; Zhou, Yang\n\n2015-06-01\n\nAn electrostatically charged spacecraft accelerates as it moves through the Earth's magnetic field due to the induced Lorentz force, providing a new means of propellantless electromagnetic propulsion for orbital maneuvers. The feasibility of Lorentz-augmented spacecraft formation flying in elliptic orbits is investigated in this paper. Assuming the Earth's magnetic field as a tilted dipole corotating with Earth, a nonlinear dynamical model that characterizes the orbital motion of Lorentz spacecraft in the vicinity of arbitrary elliptic orbits is developed. To establish a predetermined formation configuration at given terminal time, pseudospectral method is used to solve the optimal open-loop trajectories of hybrid control inputs consisted of Lorentz acceleration and thruster-generated control acceleration. A nontilted dipole model is also introduced to analyze the effect of dipole tilt angle via comparisons with the tilted one. Meanwhile, to guarantee finite-time convergence and system robustness against external perturbations, a continuous fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller is designed and the closed-loop system stability is proved by Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations substantiate the validity of proposed open-loop and closed-loop control schemes, and the results indicate that an almost propellantless formation establishment can be achieved by choosing appropriate objective function in the pseudospectral method. Furthermore, compared to the nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller, the closed-loop controller presents superior convergence rate with only a bit more control effort. And the proposed controller can be applied in other Lorentz-augmented relative orbital control problems.\n\nApparatus and method of capturing an orbiting spacecraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHarwell, William D. (Inventor); Gardner, Dale A. (Inventor)\n\n1987-01-01\n\nApparatus and a method of capturing an orbiting spacecraft by attaching a grapple fixture are discussed. A probe is inserted into an opening, such as a rocket nozzle, in the spacecraft until a stop on the prove mechanism contacts the spacecraft. A lever is actuated releasing a spring loaded rod which moves axially along the probe removing a covering sleeve to expose spring loaded toffle fingers which pivot open engaging the side of the opening. The probe is shortened and tensioned by turning a screw thread, pressing the fingers inside of the opening to compress the spacecraft between the toggle fingers and the stop. A grapple fixture attached to the probe, which is thus secured to the spacecraft, is engaged by appropriate retrieval means such as a remote manipulator arm.\n\nVenus - Comparison of Venera and Magellan Resolutions\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1996-09-26\n\nThese radar images show an identical area on Venus (centered at 110 degrees longitude and 64 degrees north latitude) as imaged by the U.S. NASA Magellan spacecraft in 1991 (left) and the U.S.S.R. Venera 15/16 spacecraft in the early 1980's (right). Illumination is from the left (or west) in the Magellan image (left) and from the right (or east) in the Venera image (right). Differences in apparent shading in the images are due to differences in the two radar imaging systems. Prior to Magellan, the Venera 15/16 data was the best available for scientists studying Venus. Much greater detail is visible in the Magellan image owing to the greater resolution of the Magellan radar system. In the area seen here, approximately 200 small volcanoes, ranging in diameter from 2 to 12 kilometers (1.2 to 7.4 miles) can be identified. These volcanoes were first identified as small hills in Venera 15/16 images and were predicted to be shield-type volcanoes constructed mainly from eruptions of fluid lava flows similar to those that produce the Hawaiian Islands and sea floor volcanoes - a prediction that was confirmed by Magellan. These small shield-type volcanoes are the most abundant geologic feature on the surface of Venus, believed to number in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, and are important evidence in understanding the geologic evolution of the planet. The only other planet in our Solar System with this large number of volcanoes is Earth. Clearly visible in the Magellan image are details of volcano morphology, such as variation in slope, the occurrence and size range of summit craters, and geologic age relationships between adjacent volcanoes, as well as additional volcanoes that were not identifiable in the Venera image. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00465\n\nNASA's Orbital Debris Optical and IR Ground-Based Observing Program Utilizing the MCAT, UKIRT, and Magellan Telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLederer, Susan; Cowardin, H. M.; Buckalew, B.; Frith, J.; Hickson, P.; Pace, L.; Matney, M.; Anz-Meador, P.; Seitzer, P.; Stansbery, E.;\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCharacterizing debris in Earth-orbit has become increasingly important as the population growth rises steadily, posing greater and greater threats to active satellites with each passing year. Currently, the Joint Space Operations is tracking over 23,000 pieces of debris, ranging in size from 1-meter and larger in geosychronous orbits (GEO) to 10-cm and larger at low-Earth orbits (LEO). Model estimates suggest that there may be more than 500,000 pieces of spacecraft debris larger than 1 cm currently in orbit around the Earth. With such a small fraction of the total population being tracked, and new break-ups occurring in LEO, GEO, and Geo Transfer Orbits, new assets, techniques, and approaches for characterizing this debris are needed. With this in mind, NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office has actively tasked a suite of telescopes around the world. In 2015, the newly-built 1.3m optical Meter Class Autonomous Telescope (MCAT) came on-line on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean and is currently in its commissioning phase. MCAT is designed to track Earth-orbiting objects above 200km, conduct surveys at GEO, and work in tandem with a newly-installed Raven-class commercial-off-the-shelf system, a 0.4-meter telescope co-located on Ascension with a field-of-view similar to MCAT's and research-grade instrumentation designed to complement MCAT for observations taken either simultaneously or in tandem. The 3.8m infrared UKIRT telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, has been heavily tasked throughout 2015 and into 2016, collecting data on individual targets as well as in survey modes to study both the general GEO population as well as an individual break-up event of a BRIZ-M Rocket body that occurred in January 2016. Data collected include photometry and spectroscopy in the near-Infrared (0.85-2.5 m) and the mid-infrared (8-16 m). Finally, the 6.5-m Baade Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile was used to collect optical photometric survey data in October\n\nSpacecraft design project: Low Earth orbit communications satellite\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMoroney, Dave; Lashbrook, Dave; Mckibben, Barry; Gardener, Nigel; Rivers, Thane; Nottingham, Greg; Golden, Bill; Barfield, Bill; Bruening, Joe; Wood, Dave\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis is the final product of the spacecraft design project completed to fulfill the academic requirements of the Spacecr"
