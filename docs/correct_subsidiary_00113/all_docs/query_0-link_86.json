        "text": "Orbital's bankers failed to approve the agreement by Thursday's deadline.\n\nLowrance Electronics Inc., the Tulsa- based manufacturer of sonar products and orbital satellite receivers, said Monday it has broken off its planned $27.5 million merger with Orbital Sciences Corp.\n\nThe merger between Lowrance and Orbital, its largest competitor, was approved by executives of both companies in March, but the deal collapsed after Orbital's bankers failed to approve the agreement by Thursday's deadline, company spokesmen said. Under the agreement, Dulles, Va.-based Orbital would have purchased all of the outstanding common shares of Lowrance at $7.30 per share.\n\nLowrance Electronics shares closed Monday at $5.44 a share, down 88 cents from Thursday's closing price. More than 212,700 shares were traded, nearly eight times Lowrance's average daily volume of 28,285 shares.\n\nOrbital closed at $14.75, down $1.19 per share. More than 442,500 shares were traded, about a third higher than its average daily volume.\n\nDarrell J. Lowrance, chairman, president and chief executive of the company, said he was disappointed by the outcome of the proposed merger.\n\n\"The fundamental business of our company remains strong,\" Lowrance said. \"We are confident about the quality of our products, our market position and our business prospects.\n\n\"Our Lowrance and Eagle sonar products command the leading share of domestic and world markets, and our revolutionary GPS (global positioning system) mapping products have strengthened our brand image and profitability. Through the first four months of fiscal 2000, sales are ahead of plan and gross margins continue to increase as a result of our successful transition of remaining manufacturing processes to our Mexico facility.\"\n\nOrbital, which is losing money in a joint venture and is restating its quarter ly results, has its credit lines frozen and required its bankers' approval for the Lowrance acquisition, said William Kidd, who follows the company for C.E. Unterberg Towbin.\n\nLowrance spokesman Mark Wilmoth said Orbital couldn't tell Lowrance when its bankers would approve the proposed merger.\n\nThe largest manufacturer of small satellites, Orbital agreed to buy Lowrance on March 12 in an all-stock offer. Since March, the expected closing date of the transaction has been delayed more than once, and Orbital's stock price has fallen about 25 percent.\n\nKidd said Orbital's bankers wanted to see the company's restated third quarter results before approving the purchase.\n\nOrbital has been losing money on a data-and-messaging service venture with Canada's Teleglobe Inc., which signed fewer subscribers than expected. Orbital had planned to merge Lowrance with its subsidiary, Magellan Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. Magellan also manufactures global positioning equipment.\n\nThe merger made sense geographically as well. During the past two years, Lowrance transferred most of its manufacturing operations and 600 of its 1,000 employees to Ensenada, Mexico, about 70 miles south of San Diego. The balance of its work force and administrative operations are located in Tulsa at 12000 E. Skelly Drive.\n\nEarlier this month, Lowrance executives announced a net loss for the fiscal first quarter that ended Oct. 31 of $1.28 million, or 34 cents per share, on revenue of $13.44 million. In the same quarter a year earlier, the company posted a net loss of $1.31 million, or 35 cents per share, on revenue of $16.2 million.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
