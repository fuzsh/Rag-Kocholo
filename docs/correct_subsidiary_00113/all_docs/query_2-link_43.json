        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are entering a second space race, with an emerging priority of the global exploration community to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon. Moreover, more than 140 lunar missions are being planned for the next decade by international space agencies and commercial space companies, such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab, Argotec, and Blue Origin (Cohen et al., 2020; Tai et al., 2020). Among these missions, some notable ones include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Artemis mission, the China National Space Administration’s Chinese lunar exploration program, and the European Space Agency (ESA) European large logistics lander project. To support upcoming plans for both human and robotic activities on the lunar surface, reliable, real-time navigation and communication services are crucial.\n\nActive efforts are being invested in designing a dedicated satellite constellation for the Moon. As outlined in NASA’s Space Communication Architecture Working Group (SCAWG) report (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2006) and NASA’s preliminary lunar relay services requirements document (SRD) (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2022), these lunar satellites will provide navigation and communication signals for missions in the south pole region in the near future and for the broader lunar surface (global coverage) in the long term. The Moon’s south pole region (comprising southern latitudes greater than 80° (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2022)) is a key region of interest (Flahaut et al., 2020), given the recent discovery of water ice deposits in its permanently shadowed craters, such as Shackleton, Shoemaker, Faustini, and Haworth. To provide satellite-based navigation and communication services, NASA has conceptualized the LunaNet framework (Israel et al., 2020), and the ESA has begun work on its Moonlight initiative (Cozzens, 2021). Additionally, an Italian space company called Argotec and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are collaborating on a lunar constellation concept called ANDROMEDA. NASA has also expressed interest in using a small satellite (SmallSat) platform for the future lunar constellation, as SmallSats are cost-effective, easily scalable, and rapidly deployable (Israel et al., 2020). We refer to the dedicated lunar constellation providing navigation and communication services as a lunar navigation and communication satellite system (LNCSS).\n\nOur work focuses on designing a SmallSat-based LNCSS that serves the lunar south pole region while considering the following design criteria: i) adequate accuracy of user position and receiver clock timing and ii) sufficient daily volume of communication data transfer to/from Earth. Note that the long-term goals of the LNCSS include global availability of these services and communication connectivity among lunar assets, which will be addressed in future work. Given that lunar constellation initiatives are in their preliminary stages, many key design considerations are yet to be finalized. Some examples of design considerations, as shown in Figure 1, include the satellite clock, constellation size, lunar orbit, and so on. For example, because the Moon has an anisotropic gravitational field, a potential lunar orbit investigated in recent literature (Ely & Lieb, 2006) is the elliptical lunar frozen orbit (ELFO). This interest has arisen because ELFOs minimize sensitivity to external perturbations for providing persistent, stable coverage to either the north or south pole with no requirement for station-keeping, i.e., ΔV10yrs ≈ 0.\n\n1.1 LNCSS Constellation Design Criteria and Performance Metrics\n\nThe navigation service performance of a SmallSat-based LNCSS design can be analyzed using various metrics, including the following (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2006, 2022):\n\nLunar user equivalent ranging error (UERE): Quantifies the ranging accuracy of transmitted satellite signals\n\nGeometric dilution of precision (GDOP): Evaluates the geometry of LNCSS satellites with respect to the lunar user, which in turn affects the expected position and timing error covariances\n\nNavigation service availability: Denotes the percentage of time during which a navigation solution can be estimated for a lunar user at a given point on the Moon (equivalent to the percent visibility of at least four LNCSS satellites)\n\nNavigation service coverage: Denotes the percentage of area of the lunar south pole at which navigation services are available\n\nNavigation service failure tolerance: Denotes the navigation service availability for a lunar user at a given point on the Moon, under a single-satellite failure (equivalent to the percent visibility of at least five LNCSS satellites)\n\nSimilarly, one can evaluate the communication service performance of an LNCSS design in terms of various metrics, including the following (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2006, 2022):\n\nData rate: Denotes the rate of communication data transfer between the lunar user and Earth\n\nCommunication service availability: Denotes the percentage of time for which a communication link between a lunar user and Earth can be maintained (equivalent to the percent visibility of at least one LNCSS satellite)\n\nCommunication service coverage: Determines the percent area of the lunar south pole at which communication services are available\n\nCommunication service failure tolerance: Denotes the communication service availability for a lunar user (at a given point on the Moon), under failure of any one satellite (equivalent to the percent visibility of at least two LNCSS satellites)\n\nAdditionally, other SmallSat factors influencing the LNCSS design are as follows:\n\nDelta-V for station-keeping: Denotes a measure of orbital stability, i.e., maneuvers required to maintain the desired orbit in the presence of higher perturbations due to the weak lunar gravity field and the strong third-body perturbations from Earth\n\nSize, weight, and power (SWaP) of the onboard equipment: Accounts for the limited payload capacity of the SmallSat platform\n\nOverall cost: Accounts for one-time costs and recurring costs\n\nNote that one-time costs include the development cost of a satellite and its onboard equipment, launch costs from Earth, and injection costs for inserting a satellite into a lunar orbit from a transfer orbit. Recurring costs include the production costs of an entire constellation, replacement costs of end-of-mission-life satellites, maintenance costs related to health checks, and operation costs such as costs related to the Deep Space Network (DSN)-based tracking network (if relevant), uplink of corrections to onboard timing, and ephemeris (if relevant).\n\nNote that this work’s focus is on assessing which design considerations influence satellite-level and constellation-level choices, whereas accounting for other factors, such as hardware design, link budget, signal strength, and lunar user burden, will be explored in future works.\n\n1.2 Preliminary Design and Performance Requirements\n\nAlthough NASA has outlined key design criteria and performance considerations for a future LNCSS, no well-defined quantitative standards currently exist. However, some preliminary needs have been identified by international space agencies and commercial space companies based on future lunar mission needs. For instance, the global exploration community targets a three-dimensional (3D) positioning accuracy below 50 m to be provided by the lunar satellite constellation (Cozzens, 2021). Moreover, the NASA SRD (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2022) quantifies the desired knowledge of 3σ horizontal position for lunar surface users to be less than 10 m and 3σ timing to be within 0.1 ms. Additionally, the real-time knowledge onboard any LNCSS satellite is expected to be within a 1σ position of 4 m, 1σ velocity of 0.4 m/s, and 1σ timing of 20 ns (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2022). Furthermore, in terms of communication service reliability, the daily data volume between a lunar user and Earth is prescribed to satisfy ≥ 160 GB (Rimani et al., 2021), 240–2400 GB (European Space Agency, 2021), or at least 600 GB (Schier, 2022). For reference, the daily volume of data transmitted by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which was launched in 2009, is 461 GB (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2009). In addition, the high data rate services for the return link (i.e., lunar user to Earth) are expected to be 5–100 Mbps (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2022).\n\n1.3 Related Work\n\nThere exist rich preliminary studies on the design of future lunar constellations. However, these prior works do not explore all of the navigation and communication design criteria and performance metrics from a SmallSat perspective, as outlined in Section 1.1.\n\nWith regards to the lunar constellation design, the authors of Murata et al. (2022) designed an ELFO-based constellation, wherein they assess the navigation performance at the lunar south pole using the dilution of precision (DOP), satellite visibility, and position accuracy. To provide global lunar coverage, prior works (Pereira & Selva, 2020, 2022) have investigated design trade-offs among various constellations with near-circular polar orbits and frozen orbits by evaluating their DOP, position accuracy, delta-V, and overall cost. In Nallapu et al. (2020), the authors designed a halo-orbit-based lunar constellation to address only communication-related requirements, namely, coverage, synchronization, and received power. Another orbital study (Iannone et al., 2021) investigated the navigation service performance of Walker orbits and ELFOs in terms of availability, DOP, and SmallSat factors, namely, station-keeping needs and overall cost. In Thompson et al. (2010), the authors discussed preliminary criteria related to navigation and communication for lunar constellations based on frozen and halo orbits. Prior work (Hamera et al., 2008) presented a low-cost lunar constellation concept using SmallSats in halo orbits, wherein the designs are evaluated based on position accuracy, overall cost, orbital stability, communication availability, and communication coverage.\n\nTo meet the stringent SWaP requirements onboard a SmallSat-based LNCSS, one strategy is to opt for a lower-grade satellite clock instead of a higher-grade clock. The grade of the satellite clock, which determines the timing stability and affects the navigation ranging precision and communication time synchronization offered to lunar users, is critical for designing a reliable navigation and communication system. Although using a lower-grade clock for an LNCSS limits its timing stability, one can intelligently mitigate this shortcoming by harnessing the signals already being broadcast by the legacy Earth-GPS constellation. Utilizing Earth-GPS signals for various lunar applications has been an active research topic in recent times, especially since the occurrence of the following major events: a) NASA’s antenna characterization experiment (Donaldson et al., 2020) modeled the signal performance in Earth-GPS transmit antenna side lobes and b) recent simulation studies (Capuano et al., 2015; Winternitz et al., 2019) designed a high-sensitivity Earth-GPS receiver and confirmed the successful acquisition of Earth-GPS signals at lunar distances, despite significantly attenuated levels of signal power. Given these early successes, there is great potential in integrating a lower-grade clock with an Earth-GPS receiver to maintain desired timing accuracy onboard a SmallSat-based LNCSS satellite.\n\nIn prior works (Bhamidipati et al., 2021, 2022a), we proposed the design of a SmallSat-based lunar navigation satellite that utilizes available Earth-GPS signals (when not occluded by Earth or the Moon) to estimate the timing corrections of a lower-grade satellite clock. A formulation of a lunar UERE was devised that primarily depends on the root-mean-square (RMS) timing error in the time transfer from the Earth GPS. In another prior work (Bhamidipati, Mina, & Gao, 2022b), a case study analysis was performed, wherein the trade-off between different grades of satellite clocks and lunar orbits in designing a lunar navigation satellite with Earth-GPS time transfer was analyzed. We demonstrated a lunar UERE that was comparable to that of the Earth GPS across various case studies, even with low-SWaP clocks, such as a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) (Schmittberger & Scherer, 2020).\n\n1.4 Proposed Idea and Key Contributions\n\nIn Figure 2, the design of a SmallSat-based LNCSS with Earth-GPS time transfer that provides both navigation and communication services at the lunar south pole is conceptualized. A hybrid constellation design is developed, wherein all satellites provide navigation services but only a fraction are additionally enabled with communication services. By selectively equipping only some satellites in the LNCSS constellation with a communication payload, space segment costs are saved and the onboard SWaP is reduced (Sections 3.3.3) and 3.2.5) demonstrate that the LNCSS satellite’s average cost and onboard SWaP are congruent with NASA’s low-budget SmallSat missions).\n\nIn this work, various LNCSS constellation case studies are formulated and evaluated based on design criteria and performance metrics of navigation and communication, as well as SmallSat factors. As explained earlier, the navigation service reliability is assessed in terms of position and timing accuracy, which represent the design criteria, while the lunar UERE, GDOP, availability, coverage, and failure tolerance are considered as navigation performance metrics. Similarly, the communication service reliability is assessed in terms of sufficient daily volume of data transfer to/from Earth, which represents the key design criteron, while the data rate, availability, coverage, and failure tolerance are considered as additional performance metrics of the communication service. SmallSat factors are also heuristically evaluated, including the onboard SWaP and space segment cost, which is an important component of the overall cost outlined above.\n\nTo account for SmallSat constraints on the LNCSS constellation design, time transfer is performed using an onboard Earth-GPS receiver (i.e., whenever at least one Earth-GPS satellite is visible) to compute timing corrections for a low-cost onboard clock. To execute this time transfer, unlike prior works (Bhamidipati et al., 2021, 2022a, 2022b), a three-state Kalman filter is formulated that accounts for nonlinearities in clock state propagation by estimating the clock drift rate in addition to the clock bias and drift states. A modified lunar UERE (navigation performance metric) is estimated by first computing a broadcast clock component, which depends on the filter estimation error from Earth-GPS time transfer. The attainable data rate (communication performance metric) is also modeled between an LNCSS satellite and Earth, which, among other factors, depends on the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is influenced by the bit error rate, which in turn depends on the filter estimation error. Indeed, the proposed Earth-GPS time transfer affects both the navigation lunar UERE and communication data rate and thereby influences both navigation and communication design criteria from a SmallSat perspective.\n\nThis study is based on prior work (Bhamidipati, Mina, Sanchez, et al., 2022), and the key contributions of this work are as follows:\n\nWe conceptualize an LNCSS with time transfer from the Earth GPS, wherein all satellites are enabled to provide navigation services at the lunar south pole with a fraction of the satellites additionally providing communication services.\n\nWe design a three-state Kalman filter that harnesses legacy Earth-GPS signals to estimate the bias, drift, and drift rate of a low-cost onboard clock. Based on these estimates, a modified lunar UERE metric (as compared with our prior work (Bhamidipati et al., 2021, 2022b)) is devised, and the data rate that can be attained for communication between an LNCSS satellite and Earth is determined.\n\nWe develop three LNCSS case studies involving ELFO-based constellation designs. In particular, case studies are formulated by varying the orbital parameters, number of orbit planes, and satellites per plane. Additionally, different elevations that a user at the lunar south pole might encounter are investigated, i.e., a low mask angle in open-sky settings and a high mask angle in restricted satellite visibility regions, such as in a lunar crater.\n\nWe assess the trade-offs across different LNCSS case studies based on whether the design criteria and performance metrics for navigation and communication services as well as SmallSat factors comply with the preliminary requirements proposed by various stakeholders such as NASA, the ESA, and commercial space agencies. As discussed earlier, navigation-related design criteria are assessed in terms of positioning and timing accuracy achieved whereas communication-related criteria are evaluated based on the daily volume of data transferred to/from Earth.\n\n2 SMALLSAT-BASED LNCSS WITH EARTH-GPS TIME TRANSFER: DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWe describe the mathematical formulation of an Earth-GPS time transfer that performs clock estimation. Note that, we consider the clock estimation technique to be decoupled from that of orbit estimation in the Earth-GPS time-transfer design, i.e., position and velocity of the LNCSS satellite is obtained from known/pre-computed ephemeris. For more details, please refer to our prior work (Bhamidipati, Mina, & Gao, 2022a), wherein clock estimation errors are analyzed as broadcast ephemeris errors onboard an LNCSS satellite are varied across different orders of magnitude. Addressing the correlation between the onboard clock and the orbital trajectory of an LNCSS satellite is an important task, which will be explored in future works. Navigation and communication design considerations are also explained from the perspective of a SmallSat platform and hybrid lunar constellation.\n\n2.1 Modified Earth-GPS Time-Transfer Design\n\nCompared with prior works (Bhamidipati et al., 2021, 2022a, 2022b) that utilized a linear two-state clock model, a three-state Kalman filter is designed in this work. This modified filter accounts for the nonlinearities of a lower-grade onboard clock while harnessing the Earth-GPS signals (when available). For any LNCSS satellite, the filter maintains the LNCSS clock estimate at each time epoch t by propagating the following state vector: , where bt is the clock bias state in m, is the clock drift in ms−1, and is the clock drift rate in ms−2, with units converted from the timing domain through multiplication by the speed of light, c = 299792458 m/s. The equations derived in Zucca and Tavella (2005) are closely followed to model the time and measurement update equations.\n\nIn the timing filter, a time update is performed every Δt seconds to estimate the predicted state vector based on the clock error propagation model shown in Equation (1). In addition, the state covariance matrix is propagated according to Equation (2), where the process noise covariance Q is defined in terms of diffusion coefficients σ1, σ2, and σ3: These diffusion coefficients represent the intensity of noise in each state (Zucca & Tavella, 2005):\n\n1\n\n2 where and are the predicted state vector and state error covariance matrix at time step t, respectively, xt−1 and Pt−1 are the corrected state vector and state error covariance matrix at time step t−1, respectively, and μ3 denotes the linear coefficient of the time variation of the clock drift rate. The process noise covariance matrix Q is defined as follows:\n\n3\n\nThe state transition matrix A is defined by , and the control matrix G is defined by .\n\nThe diffusion coefficients σ1, σ2, and σ3 can be written in terms of h0 and h−2, which are the power spectral density coefficients obtained from an Allan deviation plot (Krawinkel & Schön, 2015). Comparing Equations (6) and (8) from Van Dierendonck and McGraw (1984) with Equations (46) and (48) from Zucca and Tavella (2005), and . Additionally, in this work, the frequency drift is considered to be constant, which implies that σ3 = 0 (Zucca & Tavella, 2005).\n\nTo execute the measurement update step, i.e., to perform a time transfer from the Earth-GPS, the received carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) is first assessed to evaluate whether at least one Earth-GPS satellite is visible, as also done in prior work (Bhamidipati et al., 2021, 2022b). Then, the expected pseudorange and pseudorange rates are determined from the visible Earth-GPS satellites to form a measurement vector of residuals. The measurement vector is as follows:\n\n4 where NeGPS,t is the total number of visible Earth-GPS satellites at time t and and are the pseudorange and pseudorange rate residuals, respectively, from satellite k. The pseudoranges and pseudorange rates provide information about clock bias and clock drift, respectively.\n\nWith the measurement vector and modeled measurement covariance, the filter applies corrections to the predicted timing state via standard Kalman filter expressions to obtain the updated state vector xt and state covariance Pt. In this work, the measurement model Ct is defined in accordance with the three-state vector as follows:\n\n5 where 0a×b represents a matrix with size a × b of zeros and 1a×b represents a matrix with size a × b of ones. Additionally, the measurement covariance matrix is modeled as a time-dependent diagonal matrix, based on the tracking errors of the receiver delay lock loop, phase lock loop, and Earth-GPS UERE (different from that of the lunar UERE). This work discards the Earth-GPS signals that pass through Earth’s atmosphere. An investigation of other options, such as modeling Earth’s atmosphere effects or formulating ionospheric-free Earth-GPS measurements, is left as an extension for future work.\n\n2.2 Navigation Service Design Considerations\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, the navigation design criteria, which involve achieving adequate position and timing accuracy, mathematically depend on the product of two performance metrics, namely, the lunar UERE and GDOP. The other three performance metrics discussed in Section 1, namely, availability, coverage, and failure tolerance, influence when, where, and for how long the navigation services are available. These three performance metrics are largely governed by the number of visible LNCSS satellites at the lunar south pole region.\n\nPrior works (Bhamidipati et al., 2021, 2022b) have provided an in-depth breakdown of the lunar UERE formulation, utilizing the fact that, unlike Earth, the Moon does not have an atmosphere and buildings. Therefore, the error sources included in the lunar UERE metric, denoted by σUERE, LCNSS in Equation (6), are the broad-cast clock σclk, LNCSS, group delay σgd, LNCSS, broadcast ephemeris σeph, LCNSS, and receiver noise σrec, LNCSS. The broadcast clock component depends on the error in estimating timing corrections from the Earth-GPS time transfer. Note that the error sources caused by the LNCSS satellite attitude errors and the antenna phase center offsets are considered to be minor in comparison and thus negligible:\n\n6\n\n2.3 Communication Service Design Considerations\n\nThe communication design criteria, which involve ensuring sufficient daily data volume to and from Earth, depend on the attainable data rate. Figure 4 illustrates how the communication between lunar users and Earth consists of two key communication links (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2022): one between the LNCSS and Earth via the Ka-band and one between the LNCSS and the lunar user via the S-band. Note that the frequency bands for lunar communications are pre-allocated (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2022), wherein the Ka-band is assigned for long-range and the S-band is allocated for lunar-satellite-to-surface-user communications. Both data links have an associated data rate, denoted as dKa for the LNCSS–Earth data link in the Ka-band and dS for the LNCSS–user link in the S-band. The two data links also both have an associated summed daily availability for data transfer across all communication satellites, similarly denoted as tKa and tS in Figure 4.\n\nApart from the data rate, the other communication performance metrics discussed in Section 1, namely, the availability, coverage, and failure tolerance, influence when, where, and for how long the services are available. These three performance metrics depend on the number of communication-enabled LNCSS satellites visible at the lunar south pole region.\n\nMathematically, the daily data volume through each communication link, or the amount of data that can be transferred per day through each link, is as follows:\n\n7\n\n8 where the ‘Ka’ subscript denotes terms for the Ka-band and the ‘S’ subscript denotes terms for the S-band, dKa and dS are denoted in bits/second (bps), and tKa and tS are denoted in seconds. For instance, given an LNCSS constellation with one communication-enabled satellite, tKa < 86400 s, whereas with two communication-enabled satellites, tKa < 172800 s. Because any data transfer must occur through both communication links, the total daily data volume D for communications between the lunar user and Earth is evaluated as follows:\n\n9\n\nGiven that the lunar surface can have multiple users sending data simultaneously to any visible LNCSS satellite, DS is generally expected to depend on the number of users and could be larger than DKa once multiple users are deployed on the lunar surface. Furthermore, for any scientific data collected from the lunar surface, to ensure maximal scientific return and to reduce the data storage burden for LNCSS satellites, DKa is required to be comparable to or greater than DS.\n\nThis work focuses on analyzing the LNCSS–Earth daily data volume DKa, given that this component of the communication link could become a potential bottleneck in the total data transfer and scientific return from lunar missions. The uplink/downlink between LNCSS and Earth is considered available when there is a direct line of sight between at least one communication-enabled LNCSS satellite and the center of Earth. To keep this analysis more generalized, the definition of the Earth support system is assumed to be abstract, with statistics calculated with respect to the center of Earth rather than a specific set of ground stations such as DSN.\n\nTo compute the attainable data rate between an LNCSS satellite and Earth, an approach similar to the one outlined by Nallapu et al. (2020) is followed. First, the minimum SNR needed to achieve a desired bit error rate for communications must be evaluated (Proakis & Salehi, 2008), which is related via the following expression for a communication system with binary phase shift keying modulation:\n\n10 where is the minimum SNR required to satisfy the desired bit error rate BER and erfc−1 is the inverse complementary error function, which is closely related to the complementary cumulative distribution function of a standard normal Gaussian random variable (Proakis & Salehi, 2008). From this minimum required SNR, the minimum data rate of reception (Nallapu et al., 2020) can be computed as follows:\n\n11 where k = 1.380649· 10−23 m2 kg s−2 K−1 is the Boltzmann constant, Trx is the noise temperature level in Kelvin, β is the phase modulation index, is the required SNR computed from Equation (10), and Prx,min is the minimum received power level in watts. The minimum received power level is also computed following an approach similar to that of Nallapu et al. (2020), i.e., as a function of the transmitted power Ptx, the receiver and transmitter gain factors Grx and Gtx, the frequency of transmission ftx, and the maximum distance between the ground station and the LNCSS satellite rmax, according to Friis’ transmission formula (Stutzman & Thiele, 2013):\n\n12 where the transmitter gain Gtx is determined from the antenna properties, including the antenna efficiency and antenna diameter (Nallapu et al., 2020).\n\n2.4 SmallSat Factors\n\nAmong the SmallSat factors discussed in Section 1, delta-V is specific to the lunar orbit chosen, whose formulation based on orbital dynamics is beyond the scope of this paper. Cost analysis for this work focuses on the empirical formulation of cost and SWaP related only to the space segment, which serves as one of the key components in LNCSS constellation design. Note that evaluations of other components of the overall cost related to launch, maintenance, and injection will be explored in future works.\n\nFor any LNCSS constellation design, the total space segment cost is formulated as a sum of the total development cost and total production cost. The total development cost denotes the non-recurring cost component incurred in designing one satellite unit (or a specific unit of onboard equipment). Meanwhile, the total production cost denotes the recurring cost component incurred in producing any desired number of satellite units (or desired units of onboard equipment). These costs are computed for the hybrid constellation design, for which the LNCSS constellation size is defined as NLNCSS and the number of navigation- and communication-enabled satellites among them as Ncomm with Ncomm < NLNCSS. The development cost is broken down into a summation of development costs associated with a communication payload and the costs for a navigation-only satellite. Similarly, the production cost is also broken down into the cost of producing NLNCSS navigation-only satellites and the cost of producing Ncomm communication payloads. Note that the development cost primarily depends on mass, while the production cost depends on the first unit cost and the number of units to be produced (Hirshorn et al., 2017; Wertz et al., 2011).\n\nTo evaluate the space segment cost, each of the following four cost components are computed individually: the development cost of a communication payload, the production cost of Ncomm communication payloads, the development cost of a navigation-only satellite, and the production cost of NLNCSS navigation-only satellites.\n\nFirstly, the development cost of a communication payload Ydev–comm is computed based on a derivation by Esper (2022). This cost, in fiscal year (FY) 2010 million dollars, is as follows:\n\n13 where L denotes the number of communication channels and mcomm is defined as the communication payload mass, which is computed by leveraging the Magellan high-gain antenna design for an empirical dish diameter (Brown, 2002). In particular, , with Nchannels as the number of communication channels onboard a satellite, Nant as the number of onboard communication antennae required for each channel, and Dant as the antenna diameter. Note that Nant ≥ 2 because an LNCSS communication satellite requires at least two communication antennae: one to communicate with lunar users and one to transmit data to/from Earth.\n\nNext, the development cost of a navigation-only satellite Ydev–nav is computed based on a derivation by Wertz et al. (2011). This cost, in FY2010 million dollars, is as follows:\n\n14 where mnav is defined as the total mass of a navigation-only satellite, which is also computed heuristically.\n\nTo compute the total mass mnav of a navigation-only satellite, the payload equipment onboard a navigation-only LNCSS satellite is broken down and the total payload power Ppayload–nav is computed. Next, the data from past deep space missions are mapped to estimate the corresponding total payload mass mnav (Wertz et al., 2011). Based on Bhamidipati et al. (2021, 2022b), European Space Agency (2023), Pereira and Selva (2020), the payload equipment onboard the navigation-only LNCSS satellite includes the following: lower-grade satellite clock, Earth-GPS receiver, navigation signal generation unit, frequency generation and upconversion unit, and remote terminal unit. The total payload power Ppayload-nav is computed as the sum of the power required by individual payloads. Then, from the total payload power, the payload mass is finally estimated in kilograms as mnav = 38(0.14Ppayload–nav)0.51 (Wertz et al., 2011). The specific power levels for each component are detailed in Section 3.2.5).\n\nThe same heuristic relationship shown in Equation (15) is followed to compute the total production costs for communication payloads and for navigation-only satellites:\n\n15 where T1 depicts the first unit cost and S represents a predefined learning rate.\n\nFor instance, to compute the total production cost for communication payloads Yprod–comm, T1 is heuristically computed as T1 = 189mcomm/1000 and N = Ncomm is assigned. In contrast, to compute the total production cost for navigation-only satellites Yprod–nav, T1 is heuristically computed from past mission data as (Pereira & Selva, 2020; Wertz et al., 2011) and N = NLNCSS is assigned.\n\nNote that all of the above formulae hold true for FY2010; therefore, each computed cost component must be scaled by an appropriate inflation factor to compute the total space segment cost. The inflation factors for conversions from 2010 up until 2036 are the same as those suggested by Table 11–9 of Wertz et al. (2011)."
