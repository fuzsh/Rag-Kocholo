        "text": "PanAmSat Corporation (NASDAQ: SPOT)\n\ntoday announced a new multi-spacecraft agreement with Orbital Sciences\n\nCorporation (NYSE: ORB) for the development of the next generation of Galaxy\n\ncable satellites. Through this latest procurement plan, PanAmSat will ensure\n\nseamless services for premier entertainment companies and Galaxy anchor\n\ncustomers, such as ABC Cable Networks, ESPN, HBO and TBS, Inc. The plan also\n\nprovides expansion capacity in the North American market for the delivery of\n\nadditional PanAmSat video services.\n\n“Orbital Sciences’ smaller geostationary satellites are an ideal match for\n\nour specific requirements. This agreement will enable PanAmSat to fulfill\n\nthe long-term needs of our anchor tenants in the Galaxy cable neighborhood\n\nas well as many other top-name programmers,” said R. Douglas Kahn, PanAmSat’\n\ns president and chief executive officer. “The new satellites will also\n\nprovide PanAmSat with additional resources to continue building networks and\n\ndeveloping new services for the delivery of traditional media as well as\n\nemerging applications.”\n\nThe procurement plan calls for Orbital Sciences to initially begin\n\nconstruction on one new spacecraft, designed to operate at 74 degrees west\n\nlongitude. Following its launch in late 2002 or early 2003, the expansion\n\nsatellite will offer 24 C-band transponders for the delivery of full-time\n\nvideo services.\n\nThe agreement also provides PanAmSat with the option for two additional\n\nsatellites to succeed the Galaxy V and Galaxy IR cable neighborhoods\n\nfollowing their scheduled retirements in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The\n\ntwo satellites would each carry 24 C-band transponders to ensure seamless\n\nservices for the dozens of leading cable programmers that depend on PanAmSat\n\nto deliver their content to all of the nearly 11,000 cable headends\n\nthroughout the United States.\n\n“We are delighted to have been selected by PanAmSat, one of the world’s\n\nmarquee providers of satellite-based communications services,” said Mr.\n\nDavid W. Thompson, Orbital’s chairman and chief executive officer. “We are\n\nlooking forward to a long, mutually beneficial relationship with PanAmSat.\n\nIn a larger sense, this contract also solidifies our place as one of the\n\nworld’s major suppliers of GEO satellites and validates our strategy,\n\ncarving out a solid niche in the market with an alternative to the larger,\n\nmore costly systems.”\n\nThe satellite procurements will support the recent long-term agreements\n\nPanAmSat signed with ABC Cable Networks, ESPN, HBO and TBS, Inc., all of\n\nwhom will continue to serve as anchor tenants on the new spacecraft. As\n\ncalled for in these agreements, PanAmSat will deliver the Disney Channel,\n\nESPN, SoapNet and Toon Disney, as well as HBO, Cinemax CNN, CNNfn, CNN\n\nHeadline News, CNN International, TNT, TBS Superstation, TCM, Cartoon\n\nNetwork and Comedy Central West through 2015.\n\nThe Galaxy cable neighborhood, which includes Galaxy IR, Galaxy V, Galaxy\n\nIX, Galaxy XR and Galaxy XI, delivers nine of the top 10 cable networks in\n\nthe country and nearly 100 channels in all.\n\nAbout Orbital Sciences\n\nOrbital is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of low-cost space\n\nsystems, including satellites, launch vehicles, space sensors and satellite\n\nground systems. Its Magellan subsidiary offers the industry’s broadest line\n\nof GPS-enabled navigation and positioning products for consumer and\n\nindustrial markets. Through its relationships with ORBCOMM, ORBIMAGE and\n\nORBNAV, Orbital is also involved with satellite-based networks that provide\n\ndata communications, high-resolution imagery and automotive information\n\nservices to customers around the world."
