BUSINESS\n\nBackground and Recent Acquisitions\n\nOrbital Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, \"Orbital\" or\n\nthe \"Company\") is a space technology company that designs, manufactures,\n\noperates and markets a broad range of space products and services that are\n\ngrouped into three categories: Launch Systems, Space and Electronics Systems,\n\nand Communications and Information Systems. Launch Systems include space and\n\nsuborbital launch vehicles and orbit transfer vehicles; Space and Electronics\n\nSystems include satellites, spacecraft platforms, space sensors and instruments,\n\nspace payloads and experiments, as well as advanced avionics and data management\n\nsystems; and Communications and Information Systems include satellite-based two-\n\nway mobile data communications systems, remote sensing systems and satellite-\n\nbased navigation products, along with satellite tracking systems and\n\nenvironmental monitoring products.\n\nOrbital was incorporated in Delaware in 1987 to consolidate the assets,\n\nliabilities and operations of Space Systems Corporation (formerly named Orbital\n\nSciences Corporation) (\"SSC\") and Orbital Research Partners, L.P. (the\n\n\"Partnership\") through an exchange offer to the Partnership and to the\n\nstockholders of SSC (the \"Consolidation\"). As a result of the consummation of\n\nthe Consolidation in 1988, SSC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital, and\n\nOrbital acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the\n\nPartnership. The Company acquired Space Data Corporation (\"Space Data\") in\n\n1988, thereby expanding its product lines and increasing its vertical\n\nintegration in production and testing. In late 1992, SSC and Space Data were\n\nmerged into Orbital, with the Company being the surviving corporation. In\n\nSeptember 1993, Orbital acquired all the assets of the Applied Science\n\nOperation, a division of The Perkin-Elmer Corporation (\"ASO\"). This operation\n\ndesigns, develops and produces satellite-borne scientific sensors for space and\n\nterrestrial research and in situ atmospheric monitoring equipment for human\n\nspace flight programs.\n\nIn August 1994 and December 1994, Orbital acquired Fairchild Space and\n\nDefense Corporation (\"Fairchild\") and Magellan Corporation (\"Magellan\"),\n\nrespectively. The Fairchild acquisition has enhanced Orbital's satellite system\n\nand subsystem development and production capabilities and has expanded Orbital's\n\nexisting product lines by adding various sophisticated electronics products.\n\nMagellan designs, manufactures and markets hand-held receivers for Global\n\nPositioning System (\"GPS\") satellite-based navigation and positioning for\n\ncommercial and consumer markets.\n\nDescription of Orbital's Products and Services\n\nThe space products and services provided by the Company are grouped into\n\nthree categories: Launch Systems, Space and Electronics Systems, and\n\nCommunications and Information Systems. Orbital's business is not seasonal to\n\nany significant extent.\n\nLaunch Systems\n\nThe Company's Launch Systems Group's products include space and suborbital\n\nlaunch vehicles and orbit transfer vehicles.\n\nSpace Launch Vehicles. The Company has developed three space launch\n\nvehicles: the Pegasus(TM) launch vehicle; the Pegasus XL(R) launch vehicle; and\n\nthe Taurus(R) launch vehicle. Orbital's Pegasus vehicle is launched from\n\nbeneath a modified large aircraft such as a Lockheed L-1011 to deploy 500- to\n\n1,000-pound satellites into low-Earth orbit. The Pegasus vehicle has been\n\ndeveloped and is being produced and marketed pursuant to a joint venture\n\nagreement with Hercules Incorporated (\"Hercules\"). Through December 1994, the\n\nCompany has conducted a total of seven Pegasus missions (including one Pegasus\n\nXL), six of which were fully or partially successful. The modified Pegasus XL,\n\ndeveloped to deploy heavier satellites into orbit, had an unsuccessful first\n\nflight in June 1994. The Company believes it has identified the cause of this\n\nfailure and has implemented what it currently believes to be the necessary\n\ncorrective actions. In 1992, Orbital entered into a ten-year lease for a\n\nLockheed L-1011 aircraft, which has been modified to enable it to launch both\n\nthe Pegasus and Pegasus XL vehicles. There is no assurance that, in the event\n\nthat the L-1011 were unavailable for any reason, another aircraft could be\n\nobtained on a timely or cost-effective basis.\n\nCustomers for Pegasus launch vehicles include the National Aeronautics and\n\nSpace Administration (\"NASA\"), the U.S. Air Force, the Advanced Research\n\nProjects Agency (\"ARPA\"), the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (\"BMDO\"),\n\nSpain's National Institute of Aerospace Technology and the Company's majority\n\nowned subsidiary, Orbital Communications Corporation (\"ORBCOMMsm\"). Orbital\n\nalso anticipates Pegasus launches in connection with certain programs of the\n\nCompany's wholly owned subsidiary, Orbital Imaging Corporation (\"ORBIMAGEsm\").\n\nThe higher-capacity Taurus vehicle is a ground-launched derivative of the\n\nPegasus vehicle that can carry payloads weighing up to 3,000 pounds to low-Earth\n\norbit and payloads weighing up to 800 pounds to geosynchronous orbit. In March\n\n1994, Orbital successfully launched the first Taurus vehicle, deploying two\n\nsatellites for ARPA.\n\nThe Company continues to explore new, longer-term research and development\n\nopportunities for more affordable and flexible space launch vehicles. In March\n\n1995, the Company and Rockwell International Corporation were selected by NASA\n\nto develop, operate and market the X-34 small reusable launch system.\n\nSuborbital Launch Vehicles. Suborbital launch vehicles place payloads\n\ninto a variety of high-altitude trajectories but, unlike space launch vehicles,\n\ndo not place payloads into orbits around the Earth. The Company's suborbital\n\nlaunch products include suborbital vehicles and their principal subsystems,\n\npayloads carried by such vehicles and related launch support installations and\n\nsystems used in their assembly and operation. The Company offers its customers\n\ncustomized vehicle and payload design, manufacturing and integration, launch and\n\nmission support and tracking and recovery services, as well as construction and\n\nactivation of launch pads and other infrastructure elements. Customers\n\ntypically use the Company's suborbital launch vehicles to launch scientific and\n\nother payloads and for defense-related applications such as target and\n\ninterceptor experiments. Primary customers of the Company's suborbital launch\n\nvehicles include the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy and BMDO.\n\nOrbital's primary programs in 1994 for suborbital launch vehicles and\n\nrelated systems included the STORM contract pursuant to which Orbital provided\n\nballistic and maneuvering tactical target suborbital vehicles for use with the\n\nPatriot and Extended Range Interceptor anti-missile defense systems for target\n\nand interceptor experiments for the U.S. Army, the Navy LEAP contract with BMDO\n\nand the High-Gear contract with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -\n\nLincoln Laboratory pursuant to which Orbital provided suborbital vehicles that\n\nserve as targets for U.S. Air Force testing of anti-missile defense systems.\n\nSince January 1991, the Company has conducted a total of 37 launches of\n\nsuborbital vehicles, of which 33 have been fully or partially successful and\n\nfour have been failures.\n\nOrbit Transfer Vehicles. Orbit transfer vehicles carry satellite payloads\n\nfrom lower- to higher-energy orbits or to interplanetary trajectories. The\n\nCompany's Transfer Orbit Stage(TM) (\"TOS(TM)\") orbit transfer vehicle completed\n\nsuccessful missions in September 1992 (NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft) and\n\nSeptember 1993 (NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite). While\n\nOrbital currently has no bookings for TOS, the Company continues to explore\n\npotential future missions for the vehicle.\n\nSpace and Electronics Systems\n\nThe Company's Space and Electronics Systems products enable Orbital to\n\nprovide its customers fully integrated, low-cost space networks and related\n\nservices. The Company's most significant Space and Electronics Systems products\n\nare spacecraft systems and payloads, engineering services, defense avionics and\n\nsensors.\n\nThe Company's Dulles, Virginia operations manage the design and production\n\nof the Company's small satellite platforms such as PegaStar(TM), MicroStar(TM)\n\nand PicoStar(TM). The PegaStar spacecraft platform is deployed by the Pegasus\n\nor Taurus launch vehicle for use as a general purpose spacecraft, and is planned\n\nto be used for certain of the Company's satellite-based remote sensing systems,\n\nsuch as the SeaStar(TM) project. The PegaStar spacecraft platform was first\n\nsuccessfully used in August 1994 in the Company's launch on a Pegasus launch\n\nvehicle of the U.S. Air Force's Advanced Photovoltaic and Electronics Experiment\n\nsatellite. Orbital's MicroStar spacecraft platform, which is placed into orbit\n\nby the Pegasus launch vehicle, is designed for use in ORBCOMM's satellite-based\n\ntwo-way data communications network (the \"ORBCOMM System\") and also for a\n\nvariety of small space science and remote sensing projects, including some of\n\nthose being pursued by ORBIMAGE. Customers for the Company's small spacecraft\n\nand related ground station equipment include NASA, the U.S. Air Force, the\n\nUniversity Corporation for Atmosphere Research and ORBCOMM.\n\nThe Company's Germantown, Maryland operations (formerly Fairchild) have\n\nenhanced Orbital's satellite system and subsystem development and production\n\ncapabilities and have expanded Orbital's existing product lines by adding\n\nvarious sophisticated electronics products. The Company designs, produces and\n\ntests small and medium class spacecraft for scientific, military and commercial\n\napplications. In addition, Orbital designs and manufactures spacecraft command\n\nand data handling, attitude control and structural subsystems for a variety of\n\ngovernment and commercial customers, and provides a broad range of spacecraft\n\ndesign engineering services as well as specialized analytical engineering\n\nservices for NASA, the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the Department of Energy\n\nand other customers.\n\nThe Company develops, manufactures and markets defense avionics, including\n\nadvanced electronics and data management systems for aircraft flight operations\n\nand ground support. These systems collect, process and store mission-critical\n\ndata for, among other things, mission planning and flight operations, and manage\n\non-board equipment for strategic tactical military aircraft, helicopters,\n\nsatellites and surface vehicles. The primary customers for data management\n\nsystems are the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, and various DoD prime contractors\n\nand foreign governments. The Company is the leading supplier of certain\n\navionics systems and products, including mission data loaders for the U.S. Navy,\n\nand data transfer equipment and digital terrain systems for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nIn addition, as a result of the Fairchild acquisition, the Company now provides\n\nstores management systems, including weapons arming and firing functions for use\n\non tactical aircraft and helicopters. The avionics systems and products are\n\ndeployed on a number of aircraft, including the F-14, F-15, F-16, F-22 and the\n\nLAMPS Helicopter.\n\nOrbital's Pomona, California operations include satellite-borne scientific\n\nsensors and instruments, such as atmospheric ozone monitoring instruments and\n\nenvironmental sensors. The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (\"TOMS\") instrument\n\nis being produced by the Company for launch on a Pegasus vehicle for NASA. TOMS\n\nmeasures ozone concentrations around the world for the purpose of monitoring the\n\neffect of man-made chemicals and atmospheric conditions on the ozone layer. In\n\naddition, Orbital is currently developing and producing various in situ\n\nmonitoring products for space and defense applications. These products include\n\nan atmospheric monitoring system for use on the Space Station called the\n\nAtmospheric Composition Monitoring Assembly (\"ACMA\"). The ACMA, developed under\n\na contract with The Boeing Company, will measure various atmospheric gases in\n\nthe crew's living quarters on the Space Station for the purpose of ensuring a\n\nhealthy living environment for astronauts. The Company also produces the\n\nCentral Atmospheric Monitoring System for the U.S. Navy for use on submarines.\n\nCommunications and Information Systems\n\nOrbital's Communications and Information Systems include products and\n\nservices provided by Orbital's Magellan, ORBCOMM and ORBIMAGE subsidiaries.\n\nMagellan manufactures GPS-based navigation and positioning products for\n\ncommercial and consumer markets including marine and aviation applications,\n\noutdoor recreational users such as hunters and hikers, professional users such\n\nas geologists, geographers, surveyors, natural resource managers and contractors\n\nand, to a lesser extent, the government. ORBCOMM and ORBIMAGE are developing\n\nsatellite-based services to address the expanding markets for global two-way\n\ndata communications and information derived from remote sensing of the\n\natmosphere, oceans and land surfaces. The Company believes that the ORBCOMM and\n\nORBIMAGE systems will require significant capital investments. Although the\n\nCompany believes the long-term profit potential of such service businesses\n\ndeveloped and supported by the Company's proprietary product technologies is\n\nsignificant, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to\n\nsuccessfully develop these businesses.\n\nSatellite-Based Navigation and Positioning Products. The Company's\n\nMagellan subsidiary designs, manufactures and markets hand-held GPS receivers\n\nthat provide users with precise positioning and navigation information. The\n\nneed for positioning and navigation information is central to a broad range of\n\npersonal and professional activities including marine navigation, outdoor\n\nrecreation (hiking and hunting), surveying and general aviation. Magellan\n\nfocuses its research, design and engineering activities on the development of\n\nGPS receivers that are reliable, portable, easy to use and affordable, recently\n\ntargeting the growing recreational market. Magellan is also expected to be a\n\nsignificant supplier of personal communicators for the ORBCOMM System and to be\n\ninvolved in the continued development of satellite-based communications and\n\ntracking technology for the ORBCOMM System.\n\nIn addition, Orbital's Germantown operations produce data management\n\nsystems that have been applied to the design, development and manufacture of\n\n\"intelligent transportation systems,\" primarily for metropolitan transit\n\noperators, that provide GPS-based location of vehicles and allow for\n\ncommunications and schedule management.\n\nORBCOMM System. The ORBCOMM System, which is being designed, developed,\n\nconstructed and launched in two phases, is designed to provide virtually\n\ncontinuous mobile data communications coverage over much of the Earth's surface.\n\nUnder this design, subscribers will be able to use inexpensive, pocket-sized\n\npersonal communicators to send and receive short messages, emergency alerts and\n\nother critical information, and to use the position-determining capability of\n\nthe communicators to obtain data concerning the location and condition of\n\nautomobiles, trucks, shipping vessels and other valuable assets. The Company\n\nexpects that the ability to send and receive other short messages and data\n\nwithout the geographic limitations of existing data communications systems will\n\nstimulate the growth of new markets for satellite-based data communications and\n\nwill be used to supplement terrestrial communications systems by providing\n\nrelatively low-cost coverage in areas outside the range of these systems.\n\nThe ORBCOMM System design consists of a constellation of small low-Earth\n\norbit satellites, a satellite control center operating and positioning the\n\nsatellites, network control centers controlling the flow of information through\n\nthe system, local ground stations sending and receiving signals between the\n\nnetwork control centers and nearby satellites, and the mobile communicators used\n\nby subscribers to transmit and receive messages to and from nearby satellites.\n\nIn early 1993, the Company successfully launched two experimental satellite\n\npayloads that obtained information concerning spectrum occupancy by existing\n\nusers in the frequency bands allocated to low-Earth orbit mobile satellite\n\nsystems. The satellite payloads also performed successfully in a variety of\n\nother ORBCOMM System tests.\n\nThe Company expects that, using at least 26 satellites and appropriately\n\nlocated gateway Earth stations, the ORBCOMM System will provide communications\n\navailability generally exceeding 95% during each 24-hour period in the United\n\nStates and other temperate zones in the Northern and Southern hemispheres and\n\nexceeding 75% of each 24-hour period in the equatorial region. Equatorial\n\nregion availability could be improved to generally exceed 90% with an additional\n\nplane of eight satellites. Outages will be dispersed in brief intervals over the\n\n24-hour period, thereby minimizing the effect of any unavailability of the\n\nsystem. The ORBCOMM System will only be available in areas where appropriate\n\nlicenses have been obtained and generally only where there is a proximate\n\ngateway Earth station.\n\nDevelopment and Financing. Effective June 30, 1993, ORBCOMM and Teleglobe\n\nMobile Partners (\"Teleglobe Mobile\"), an affiliate of Teleglobe Inc., created\n\na partnership, ORBCOMM Development Partners, L.P. (\"ORBCOMM Development\") for\n\nthe design, development, construction, testing and operation of the ORBCOMM\n\nSystem, and created two marketing partnerships to market the ORBCOMM System in\n\nthe United States and internationally. ORBCOMM U.S. L.P. and ORBCOMM\n\nInternational L.P. (together, the \"Marketing Partnerships\") each have the\n\nexclusive right to market the ORBCOMM System in the United States and\n\ninternationally, respectively. Also effective June 30, 1993, Orbital entered\n\ninto the ORBCOMM System Design, Development and Operations Agreement (the\n\n\"System Agreement\") with ORBCOMM Development pursuant to which ORBCOMM continues\n\nto have responsibility for the overall design, development, integration and\n\ntesting of the ORBCOMM System. ORBCOMM has retained control over applicable\n\nlicenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\"), consistent\n\nwith FCC regulations. The System Agreement provides that ORBCOMM will\n\nsubcontract with Orbital for construction and launch of the two satellites for\n\nthe ORBCOMM Phase 1 System and the 24 satellites for the ORBCOMM Phase 2 System,\n\nand for construction of the satellite control center, the United States network\n\ncontrol center and the four United States gateway Earth stations. The System\n\nAgreement also contains options for the construction and launch by the Company\n\nof an additional eight satellites. Under the System Agreement, Orbital is\n\nproviding satellites and launch services and vehicles and the gateway Earth\n\nstations on a fixed-price basis, and is providing the other products and\n\nservices on a cost reimbursable basis. Consistent with industry practice for\n\nmany launch contracts, the System Agreement contains certain performance\n\nwarranties with respect to the satellites and their launch.\n\nUnder ORBCOMM Development's partnership agreement, action by the\n\npartnership generally requires the approval of general partners holding a\n\nmajority of the participating interests (i.e., interests participating in\n\nprofits and losses) held by the general partners. Each of ORBCOMM and Teleglobe\n\nMobile is a general partner of ORBCOMM Development and holds 50% of the\n\nparticipating interests in ORBCOMM Development, with the result that the\n\napproval of both the Company and Teleglobe Mobile is necessary for ORBCOMM\n\nDevelopment to act. The partnership agreements for the Marketing Partnerships\n\ncontain management provisions generally similar to those of ORBCOMM Development.\n\nCurrently, the Company holds 85% of the participating interests in each of the\n\nMarketing Partnerships, and thus is generally able to control these\n\npartnerships.\n\nORBCOMM Development intends to construct and implement the ORBCOMM System\n\nin two phases: the ORBCOMM Phase 1 System, consisting of the satellite control\n\ncenter, the United States network control center, four United States gateway\n\nEarth stations and two MicroStar satellites; and the ORBCOMM Phase 2 System,\n\nconsisting of an additional 24 MicroStar satellites. ORBCOMM is licensed by the\n\nFCC to launch an additional ten satellites. The decision as to when to deploy\n\nadditional satellites will depend upon market and financial factors. The\n\nCompany currently expects to complete the construction of the ground portion of\n\nthe ORBCOMM Phase 1 System and the construction and launch of the two ORBCOMM\n\nPhase 1 System satellites in the first half of 1995. Subject to the technical\n\nsuccess of the ORBCOMM Phase 1 System and to the ability of ORBCOMM Development\n\nto secure sufficient financing from, among other sources, the exercise of the\n\nPhase 2 Option (as described below), the construction and launch of the 24\n\nadditional satellites comprising the ORBCOMM Phase 2 System is targeted to be\n\ncompleted in late 1996 or early 1997.\n\nOrbital estimates that implementation of the ORBCOMM Phase 1 System in the\n\nUnited States will cost approximately $66 million, and that implementation in\n\nthe United States of the ORBCOMM Phase 2 System will cost approximately an\n\nadditional $104 million. Although construction of the ORBCOMM Phase 1 System\n\nis almost completed, development and construction of the ORBCOMM Phase 2 System\n\nis in an early stage and the actual cost of the system and the amount and\n\nstructure of anticipated investment in ORBCOMM Development may vary\n\nsignificantly from current estimates. Teleglobe Mobile has invested $10 million\n\nin ORBCOMM Development in exchange for a 50% participating interest. Orbital\n\nhas invested approximately $55 million in ORBCOMM Development, and has committed\n\nto invest the balance of the funding necessary to implement the ORBCOMM Phase\n\n1 System, in exchange for a 50% participating interest and a non-participating\n\ninterest in an amount equal to the excess of its investment over $10 million.\n\nIn addition, Orbital and Teleglobe Mobile hold 85% and 15% participating\n\ninterests, respectively, in each of the Marketing Partnerships.\n\nTeleglobe Mobile has an option (the \"Phase 2 Option\") to increase its\n\naggregate investment in ORBCOMM Development to at least $80 million. The Phase\n\n2 Option is exercisable from the launch of the first ORBCOMM satellite and until\n\nthe later of 90 days after such launch and initial satellite signal acquisition\n\nor 30 days after completion of on-orbit satellite acceptance testing. If the\n\nPhase 2 Option is exercised, the Company will be obligated to increase its\n\naggregate investment in ORBCOMM Development to at least $66 million. ORBCOMM\n\nDevelopment intends to seek additional equity contributions and/or bank or other\n\ndebt financing for up to $20 to $25 million. ORBCOMM Development has already\n\nobtained asset-based financing of $5 million to fund a portion of its\n\ndevelopment and startup costs for the ORBCOMM Phase 2 System. The Company has\n\nguaranteed ORBCOMM Development's outstanding indebtedness, and may be required\n\nto guarantee or provide credit support in connection with additional\n\nindebtedness incurred by ORBCOMM Development. Assuming exercise of the Phase\n\n2 Option, each of Teleglobe Mobile's and Orbital's non-participating interest\n\nin ORBCOMM Development will be increased by the amount of such additional\n\ncontribution, and each will continue to hold a 50% participating interest in\n\nORBCOMM Development. The Company has been informed that Teleglobe Mobile has\n\nobtained a $44 million commitment from Technologies Resources Industries Bhd.,\n\na Malaysian telecommunications company, to acquire up to 30% of Teleglobe\n\nMobile's interest in ORBCOMM Development, and that Teleglobe Mobile intends to\n\nseek additional investors to participate in its investment in ORBCOMM\n\nDevelopment. In the event that Teleglobe Mobile does not exercise the Phase 2\n\nOption, Orbital may solicit additional equity or debt investors for ORBCOMM\n\nDevelopment and, if any additional commitment is obtained, Orbital has the\n\noption, under certain circumstances, to purchase, or cause ORBCOMM Development\n\nto purchase, Teleglobe Mobile's interest in ORBCOMM Development and the\n\nMarketing Partnerships. There can be no assurance such funding can be obtained\n\nor, if such funding is available, it will be at acceptable rates. Upon\n\ninvestment by Teleglobe Mobile in ORBCOMM Development for construction of the\n\nORBCOMM Phase 2 System, 98% of the participating interests in the Marketing\n\nPartnerships will be transferred to ORBCOMM Development, with ORBCOMM and\n\nTeleglobe Mobile each retaining a 2% participating interest in ORBCOMM U.S. and\n\nORBCOMM International, respectively.\n\nIn the event that Teleglobe Mobile does not exercise the Phase 2 Option or\n\nORBCOMM Development does not otherwise receive the necessary capital,\n\nimplementation and commercial development of the ORBCOMM System may be delayed,\n\nsignificantly restricted or possibly abandoned, and the Company could be\n\nrequired to expense part or all of its investment (approximately $55 million as\n\nof December 31, 1994) in the ORBCOMM System. In addition, start-up of the\n\nORBCOMM System will produce significant ORBCOMM Development operating losses for\n\nseveral years. Because Orbital has a 50% participating interest in ORBCOMM\n\nDevelopment, Orbital expects to recognize its pro rata share of ORBCOMM\n\nDevelopment profits and losses.\n\nAs of December 31, 1994, certain officers and employees of ORBCOMM and\n\nOrbital held options to acquire 599,074 shares of ORBCOMM's common stock (or\n\napproximately 13 percent of ORBCOMM's outstanding common stock) at option\n\nexercise prices ranging from $1.50 to $14.00 per share. Commencing in September\n\n1995, and annually thereafter, holders of ORBCOMM common stock acquired on\n\nexercise of these options may, subject to certain conditions, require ORBCOMM\n\nto purchase such ORBCOMM common stock at its then fair market value.\n\nRegulatory Approvals. In October 1994, ORBCOMM became the first company\n\nto be awarded full FCC authority to construct, launch and operate a low-Earth\n\norbit satellite-based messaging and data communications network in the United\n\nStates. This license, which provides that the ORBCOMM System must be\n\nconstructed within six years from the date the license was granted, extends for\n\na period of ten years from the date the first ORBCOMM System satellite is\n\noperational. At the end of the seventh year of the ten-year term, a renewal\n\napplication must be filed with the FCC. As with any such license, the ORBCOMM\n\nSystem license may be revoked and a license renewal application may be denied\n\nfor cause. In late 1994, two other applicants for FCC licenses similar to that\n\nawarded to ORBCOMM petitioned the FCC to reconsider the grant of the license to\n\nORBCOMM. ORBCOMM has opposed the petition, which the Company and ORBCOMM\n\nbelieve are without merit. In addition, for the ORBCOMM System to be operated\n\nin other countries throughout the world, the Company or the foreign licensees\n\nmust obtain from the appropriate foreign regulatory bodies authority to do so.\n\nThe Company anticipates that the cost of these activities will be borne\n\nprimarily by foreign licensees. ORBCOMM International has entered into\n\npreliminary agreements with 22 candidate licensees serving 69 countries to seek\n\nsuch licenses and to initiate country-specific market development in such\n\ncountries. There can be no assurance that the Company or foreign licensees will\n\nbe granted all licenses or approvals necessary to operate the ORBCOMM System in\n\nany other country.\n\nORBIMAGE Remote Sensing and Imaging Systems. The Company is currently\n\nseeking to develop and market a broad range of information services to identify\n\nand monitor global environmental changes and to collect and disseminate other\n\nremote sensing information. Small Earth-viewing satellites and related sensors\n\nand instruments to be placed in relatively low orbits are expected to offer\n\ncost-efficient data collection, daily global coverage and high-resolution\n\nimaging services.\n\nIn March 1991, Orbital entered into a contract with NASA to provide\n\nworldwide, daily ocean imagery using Orbital's SeaStar environmental monitoring\n\nsatellite system, based on the PegaStar spacecraft. The Company plans to\n\ndevelop, produce, launch and operate the SeaStar system to deliver high-quality\n\nmulti-spectral ocean imagery for up to five years, currently scheduled to\n\ncommence during 1995. In addition to providing unprocessed real-time ocean data\n\nto NASA, the Company plans to use value-added resellers and other marketing\n\nagents to sell the SeaStar data to other U.S. Government users and to potential\n\ndomestic and international customers such as commercial fishermen, oil and gas\n\ncompanies, ocean transportation companies and oceanographers.\n\nORBIMAGE is developing and marketing other small satellite-based Earth\n\nobservation, remote sensing and environmental monitoring services using, among\n\nother things, the Company's PegaStar and MicroStar spacecraft platforms, Pegasus\n\nand Taurus launch vehicles, space sensors and instruments and other space\n\nproducts. Services to be provided by ORBIMAGE could include high-resolution\n\noptical imaging of land surfaces for geographic information services, mapping\n\nand news-gathering, sensing of ocean and atmospheric conditions and measuring\n\nof ozone and other gaseous concentrations in the atmosphere. The Company is\n\ncurrently exploring potential strategic arrangements for the development of\n\nseveral remote sensing businesses, with Orbital providing launch services,\n\nspacecraft and other related products. There can be no assurance that the\n\nCompany will be able to conclude such strategic arrangements or develop\n\nprofitable commercial Earth observation, remote sensing or environmental\n\nmonitoring businesses.\n\nSatellite Tracking Systems. Orbital's ground tracking systems, installed\n\nat approximately 75 sites around the world, consist of meteorological and\n\nsatellite tracking and telemetry stations that are used to collect weather data\n\nand to communicate with and control orbiting spacecraft. Orbital's current\n\ncustomers for satellite tracking systems include Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\n(\"Lockheed Martin\"), as well as certain ORBCOMM and ORBIMAGE programs.\n\nFinancial information, including revenue and gross profit contributions,\n\nconcerning the Company's primary products and services is included in\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\n\nOperations set forth in the Company's Annual Report, and is incorporated herein\n\nby reference.\n\nCompetition\n\nOrbital believes that competition for sales of its products and services\n\nis based on price, performance and other technical features, reliability,\n\nscheduling and customization.\n\nThe primary competition to the Pegasus and Taurus vehicles is expected to\n\ncome from the smaller and larger classes, respectively, of LLV launch vehicles\n\ncurrently being developed by Lockheed Martin. Direct competition to the Taurus\n\nvehicle also comes from EER Systems' Conestoga launch vehicle. Potential\n\ncompetition to the Pegasus may come from launch systems derived from surplus\n\nballistic missiles that could be made available by the U.S. Government and\n\nvarious foreign governments including Russia. In August 1994, the President\n\nsigned the National Space Transportation Policy Presidential Decision Directive\n\npursuant to which agencies of the U.S. Government are authorized to use excess\n\nballistic missiles to launch payloads into orbit on a case-by-case basis. Such\n\nuse may only be permitted after the DoD has determined, among other things, that\n\nsuch use would meet the agency's needs and would result in a cost savings to the\n\nU.S. Government compared to a commercial launch service. Competition for Taurus\n\ncould also come from surplus Titan II launch vehicles, although Titan II\n\nproduction has been discontinued and only a limited inventory remains. Indirect\n\ncompetition to Pegasus and Taurus vehicles also exists in the form of secondary\n\nor \"piggyback\" payload capacity on large boosters such as Ariane, Titan, Long\n\nMarch and Proton launch vehicles. While secondary payloads offer a low-cost\n\nmethod of launching satellites in some cases, the secondary status of the\n\npayload often requires customers to accept less desirable orbits, \"standby\"\n\nlaunch scheduling and potentially more complicated and costly payload\n\nintegration procedures. The Company's TOS vehicle primarily competes with The\n\nBoeing Company's Inertial Upper Stage. In addition, foreign launch vehicles\n\nsuch as Europe's Ariane IV may compete with TOS for certain satellite launches,\n\nwhile certain satellites themselves have an integrated orbit transfer stage and\n\ndo not require a separate rocket such as the TOS vehicle.\n\nOrbital's suborbital launch vehicles, spacecraft systems and payloads,\n\nsatellite-based services and space support products compete with products and\n\nservices produced or provided by numerous companies and government entities.\n\nThe Company's space instruments and airborne and ground-based electronics, data\n\nmanagement systems and defense-oriented avionics products face competition from\n\nseveral established manufacturers.\n\nThe ORBCOMM System will face direct and indirect competition from numerous\n\nexisting and potential alternative communication products and services from\n\nvarious large and small companies, ranging from one-way tower-based data and\n\nmessaging services to sophisticated two-way satellite-based data and voice\n\ncommunications services. Depending on the requirement of the specific market,\n\nthe ORBCOMM System may both compete with and complement existing services such\n\nas paging (offered by SkyTel, PageNet, MobileComm, Metrocall and others),\n\ncellular data (offered by McCaw, Bell Atlantic, and others), specialized mobile\n\nradio (such as that offered by Nextel) and private networks (including Ram and\n\nArdis). ORBIMAGE may face competition from private and U.S. government entities\n\nthat provide satellite-based and other land imaging, environmental monitoring\n\nand atmospheric sensing products. Satellite-based navigation and positioning\n\nproducts manufactured by the Company's recently acquired Magellan operations\n\nface competition from other producers of GPS receivers. The Company believes\n\nthat Magellan's success will depend on its ability to continue to develop new\n\nlower-cost and enhanced performance products and to enter into and develop new\n\nmarkets for GPS receivers. The Company's space sensors and instruments face\n\ncompetition from a number of companies and university research laboratories\n\ncapable of designing and producing space instruments.\n\nMany of the Company's competitors are larger and have substantially\n\ngreater resources than the Company. Furthermore, the possibility exists that\n\nother domestic or foreign companies or governments, some with greater experience\n\nin the space industry and greater financial resources than Orbital, will seek to\n\nproduce products or services that compete with those of the Company, including\n\nthe Pegasus and Taurus launch vehicles, various suborbital launch vehicles, the\n\nTOS orbit transfer vehicle, PegaStar, MicroStar and other satellite systems, GPS\n\nreceivers and ORBCOMM and other satellite services. Any such foreign competitor\n\ncould benefit from subsidies from, or other protective measures by, its home\n\ncountry. In addition, in response to reductions in the U.S. defense budget,\n\nOrbital may face competition from companies, such as missile manufacturers, that\n\ncould attempt to adapt existing or future products for non-defense, space and\n\nsuborbital launch applications.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe Company expects to continue to invest in product-related research and\n\ndevelopment, to conceive and develop new products and services, to enhance\n\nexisting products and to seek customer and, where appropriate, strategic partner\n\ninvestments in these products. Orbital's research and development expenses,\n\nexcluding direct customer-funded development, were approximately $14.4 million,\n\n$14.9 million, and $10.6 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended\n\nDecember 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992. It is expected that the Company's research\n\nand development expenses during 1995 will be primarily for new or modified\n\nlaunch systems, spacecraft programs, including possible ORBIMAGE projects, and\n\nsatellite-based navigation and positioning products.\n\nPatents and Trademarks\n\nOrbital relies, in part, on patents, trade secrets and know-how to develop\n\nand maintain its competitive position and technological advantage. The Company\n\nholds U.S. and foreign patents relating to the Pegasus vehicle as well as for\n\nother components and products produced by the Company. The Company also has\n\nvarious pending patent applications relating to Pegasus and the ORBCOMM System.\n\nCertain of the trademarks and service marks used in connection with the\n\nCompany's products and services have been registered with the U.S. Patent and\n\nTrademark Office.\n\nComponents and Raw Materials\n\nOrbital purchases a significant percentage of its product components,\n\nincluding rocket propulsion motors and electronic equipment, from third parties.\n\nFrom time to time, Orbital obtains parts and equipment from the U.S. Government\n\nthat are used in the production of the Company's products or in the provision\n\nof the Company's services. Orbital to date has not experienced material\n\ndifficulty in obtaining such parts and equipment and believes that, if any\n\ndifficulty should arise, alternative sources of supply would be available.\n\nHowever, increased costs could be incurred in securing alternative sources of\n\nsupply.\n\nOrbital's Pegasus program Joint Venture Agreement with Hercules provides\n\nthat neither joint venturer will contract with other parties for the scope of\n\nwork to be performed by the other under the Pegasus Joint Venture Agreement\n\nwithout the consent of the other party. From time to time, issues have arisen\n\nbetween the Company and Hercules relating to the Joint Venture Agreement,\n\nparticularly with respect to the determination of each party's recoverable\n\nrecurring costs under the joint venture including the recoverability by the\n\nCompany of certain general and administrative expenses. See \"Legal\n\nProceedings.\"\n\nGovernment Contracts\n\nDuring 1994, 1993 and 1992, approximately 60 percent, 70 percent and 80\n\npercent, respectively, of the Company's total annual revenues were derived from\n\ncontracts with the U.S. Government and its agencies or from subcontracts with\n\nthe U.S. Government's prime contractors. Orbital's government contracts are\n\nsubject to regular audit and periodic reviews and may be modified, increased,\n\nreduced or terminated in the event of changes in government requirements or\n\npolicies, Congressional appropriations and program progress and scheduling.\n\nU.S. Government curtailment of expenditures for space research and development\n\nand related products and services could have a material adverse effect on\n\nOrbital's revenues and results from operations. Agencies within the U.S.\n\nGovernment and commercial customers to which sales by the Company accounted for\n\nten percent or more of the Company's consolidated 1994 revenues were NASA, DoD\n\nand ORBCOMM.\n\nOrbital's major contracts with the U.S. Government fall into three\n\ncategories: firm fixed-price contracts, fixed-price incentive fee contracts and\n\ncost-plus-fee contracts. Under firm fixed-price contracts, work performed and\n\nproducts shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual\n\ncosts incurred in connection with the contract. Risk of loss due to increased\n\ncost, therefore, is borne by the Company although some of this risk may be\n\npassed on to subcontractors. Under fixed-price government contracts requiring\n\nwork with lead times in excess of six months prior to delivery, Orbital may\n\nreceive progress payments, generally in an amount equal to between 80 and\n\n95 percent of monthly costs, or it may receive milestone payments upon the\n\noccurrence of certain program achievements. Fixed-price incentive fee contracts\n\nprovide for sharing by the customer and the supplier of unexpected costs\n\nincurred or savings realized within specified limits, and may provide for\n\nadjustments in price depending on actual contract performance other than costs.\n\nCosts in excess of the negotiated maximum (ceiling) price and the risk of loss\n\nby reason of such excess costs are borne by the Company, although some of this\n\nrisk may be passed on to subcontractors. Under a cost-plus-fee contract,\n\nOrbital recovers its actual allowable costs incurred and receives a fee\n\nconsisting of a base amount that is fixed at the inception of the contract\n\nand/or an award amount that is based on the Government's subjective evaluation\n\nof the contractor's performance in terms of the criteria stated in the contract.\n\nAll of Orbital's U.S. Government contracts and, in general, its\n\nsubcontracts with the U.S. Government's prime contractors provide that such\n\ncontracts may be terminated at will by the U.S. Government or the prime\n\ncontractor, respectively. Furthermore, any of these contracts may become\n\nsubject to a government-issued stop work order under which the Company is\n\nrequired to suspend production. In the event of a termination at will, Orbital\n\nis normally entitled to recognize the purchase price for delivered items,\n\nreimbursement for allowable costs for work in process, and an allowance for\n\nreasonable profit thereon or adjustment for loss if completion of performance\n\nwould have resulted in a loss. The Company has experienced several contract\n\nsuspensions and terminations in the past.\n\nBacklog\n\nThe Company's backlog at December 31, 1994 and 1993 was approximately $335\n\nmillion and $210 million, respectively. As of December 31, 1994, approximately\n\n60 percent of the Company's backlog was with the U.S. Government and its\n\nagencies or from subcontracts with the U.S. Government's prime contractors.\n\nBacklog consists of aggregate contract values for firm product orders, excluding\n\nthe portion previously included in operating revenues on the basis of percentage\n\nof completion accounting, and including government contracts awarded but not\n\nsigned and orders not yet funded in the amounts of approximately $171 million\n\nand $108 million as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Approximately\n\n$143 million of backlog is currently scheduled to be performed beyond 1995.\n\nBacklog excludes unexercised contract options having an aggregate potential\n\ncontract value at December 31, 1994 of approximately $828 million.\n\nEnvironmental Regulation\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to a variety of Federal, state and\n\nlocal environmental regulations, including laws regulating air and water quality\n\nand hazardous materials and regulations implementing those laws. The Company\n\nis one of several potentially responsible parties involved in a California\n\nmandated clean-up of a manufacturing facility near Salinas, California. Through\n\nDecember 31, 1994, Orbital and two other potentially responsible parties have\n\nshared certain investigation and monitoring costs, resulting in total Company\n\nexpenditures after insurance recoveries of approximately $85,000. Based on the\n\ncost allocations among responsible parties to date, the Company currently\n\nbelieves that its share of total clean-up costs, which would be payable over a\n\nnumber of years, should not exceed $600,000 before insurance recoveries.\n\nOrbital believes that it will receive insurance reimbursement for a significant\n\nportion of its clean-up costs. The Company does not believe that its total\n\nexposure in this clean-up, or that other compliance by it with applicable\n\nenvironmental regulations, will have a material adverse effect on its\n\noperations.\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of December 31, 1994, Orbital had 1,845 full-time permanent employees.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nIn 1993, Orbital entered into a 12-year lease agreement for approximately\n\n100,000 square feet of office and engineering space in Dulles, Virginia, which\n\nserves as its corporate headquarters. In 1994, the Company completed\n\nconstruction of an approximately 30,000 square-foot satellite engineering and\n\nmanufacturing facility on land adjacent to the Dulles office facility. Orbital\n\nalso leases approximately 320,000 square feet of office, engineering and\n\nmanufacturing space in Germantown, Maryland; 305,000 square feet of office,\n\nengineering and manufacturing space in Chandler, Arizona; approximately 135,000\n\nsquare feet of office, engineering and manufacturing space in Pomona,\n\nCalifornia; and approximately 40,000 square feet of office, engineering and\n\nmanufacturing space in San Dimas, California. The Company leases or owns other\n\nsmall facilities or offices in Huntsville, Alabama; Edwards Air Force Base,\n\nCalifornia; Vandenberg Air Force Base, California; and Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nAlthough completion of the Company's existing and pending contracts may in the\n\nfuture require additional manufacturing capacity, Orbital believes that its\n\nexisting facilities are adequate for its near and medium-term requirements.\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn 1993, Hercules commenced arbitration proceedings against the Company\n\nrelating to certain insurance proceeds obtained by the Company in connection\n\nwith the second Pegasus mission which occurred in 1991. In 1994, the\n\narbitration panel unanimously held in favor of the Company and denied all of\n\nHercules' claims. On January 3, 1994, Hercules filed a lawsuit against the\n\nCompany in Arizona Superior Court in Phoenix, Arizona. The action concerns\n\nalleged breaches of certain representations and warranties in the 1988 stock\n\npurchase agreement between Hercules and Orbital, pursuant to which Hercules\n\npurchased 20 percent of Orbital's common stock. These shares were sold by\n\nHercules in June 1991. Hercules is seeking unspecified monetary damages in an\n\namount up to $15,000,000. On July 21, 1994, Hercules filed a lawsuit against\n\nthe Company in the Delaware Chancery Court for New Castle County. The action\n\nconcerns alleged breaches by the Company, in its joint venture with Hercules,\n\nof certain fiduciary duties and certain terms of the joint venture agreement.\n\nHercules is seeking unspecified monetary damages, including up to $3,000,000 for\n\none count. In March 1995, this action was dismissed with prejudice and is now\n\nsubject to adjudication by an arbitration panel. Orbital believes that the\n\nclaims in both pending suits are without merit and will not have a material\n\nadverse effect on the financial condition of the Company. Orbital is disputing\n\nvigorously Hercules' claims. Although the Company believes that regardless of\n\nthe outcome, Hercules' claims do not affect its obligations under the Pegasus\n\njoint venture agreement, the failure to resolve these claims could adversely\n\naffect the joint venture and the Company.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nThere was no matter submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders\n\nduring the fourth quarter of 1994.\n\nITEM 4A.
