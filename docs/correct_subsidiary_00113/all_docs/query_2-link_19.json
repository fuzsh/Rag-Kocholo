        "text": "The biggest piece of the puzzle to send humans on a trip around the moon for the first time in more than half a century is on its way to Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe Boeing-built core stage of NASA's Space Launch System rocket was loaded onto NASA's Pegasus barge from the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, and is now taking the 900-mile trip to Florida.\n\nThe flight hardware that includes the four RS-25 engines made by Aerojet Rocketdyne from the space shuttle era will then be taken to the Vehicle Assembly Building where it will be turned upright standing 212 feet tall. It will be married to other components of the SLS rocket including two solid rocket boosters from Northrop Grumman that when combined produce 8.8 million pounds of thrust on liftoff.\n\nThe next flight is Artemis II, which is targeting launch from KSC's Launch Pad 39-B no earlier than September 2025. That mission will take NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch along with Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen on a trip out to the moon and back aboard the Orion spacecraft built by Lockheed Martin."
