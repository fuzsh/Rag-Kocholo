        "text": "Wall Street doesn't seem to have noticed yet, but August has been an awesome month for Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles. In just the first eight days of the month, it:\n\nPut up the OrbView-2 satellite, the first privately owned satellite able to provide color pictures of the Earth's lands and oceans for commercial customers and scientific researchers.\n\nAnnounced that its Magellan division, the biggest maker of global-positioning system (GPS) navigational receivers for the pleasure boating and hiking markets, signed a deal to buy the automotive GPS business of Rockwell International, the leading supplier of on-board satellite navigation systems for cars.\n\nWon a contract to design and build 17 satellites for the planed Ellipso network, a \"constellation\" of low-flying orbiters that will provide low-cost satellite phone, fax and data services early in the next century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWon a $41.5 million Air Force contract to use its private OrbView satellites to provide spy-in-the-sky images for an exotic combat research project called Warfighter-1.\n\nGET CAUGHT UP\n\nStories to keep you informed\n\nWhat to know about the Democratic convention now that Biden’s out of race\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nHeat pumps, EV chargers and more: U.S. unveils $4.3 billion in local climate funds\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\n‘Magical’ self-portrait was hidden for decades — until the canvas was flipped\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nHow can I get healthier hair?

Here’s what to know.\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nDespite all the action, Orbital Sciences stock didn't gain much altitude. It was up just $1 for the week, closing Friday at $21.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where the shares trade as ORBI.\n\nOrbital Sciences has never been a favorite on Wall Street, even by the standards of lackluster space stocks.\n\nCommercial space companies are one of the Washington area's home-grown businesses, a growing industry that includes diversified giants like Lockheed Martin Corp. of Bethesda and smaller companies that specialize in space travel and satellite communications.\n\nThe space industry doesn't disappoint investors as much as the biotechnology industry, which perennially promises breakthroughs and profits that always remain just around the corner, but as an investment, it is still an underachiever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as investors are concerned, most of the region's satellite companies are in the financial equivalent of geostationary orbit: They whirl through space at thousands of miles an hour but never really go anywhere.\n\nSeveral other space stocks are selling for less than the initial public offering price: SpaceHab Inc. of Vienna (SPAB on Nasdaq) went public in 1995 at $12 a share and now is selling for $9.75; Orion Network Systems of Rockville (ONSI on Nasdaq) went public the same year at $14 and now is at $12.25. American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston (SKYC on Nasdaq) sold stock in 1993 for $21 a share; the price has fallen to $7.75.\n\nShares of one of the oldest companies in the business, Comsat Corp. of Bethesda (CQ on NYSE), have gyrated between $15 and $30 a share over the past five years and now are trading at $22.56 1/4 on NYSE. Comsat veered off course a decade ago, diversifying into entertainment and other businesses that failed to turn a profit. Since new CEO Betty Alewine took control a few months ago, Comsat has returned to its roots, stabilizing the stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hottest stock in the Washington space industry is D.C.-based CD Radio Inc. (CDRD on Nasdaq), which plans to use satellites to broadcast CD-quality music to cars. CD Radio stock came out at $5 a share in 1994 and drifted aimlessly while the company wrangled with the Federal Communications Commission over getting a broadcasting license. The stock dropped below $4 in February, then took off last spring when the FCC finally granted its license. It closed Friday at $18.37 1/2.\n\nThough it has caught the imagination of Wall Street, CD Radio is the most speculative of the Washington space stocks. The company has never taken in a dime of revenue or profit.\n\nOrbital Sciences, on the other hand, is profitable, and this year could bring in enough revenue to push Comsat out of its first place position among the pure-play space companies in the Washington region. Comsat reported revenue of more than $1 billion last year, but after spinning off its non-space operations is projecting 1997 revenue of about $600 million -- roughly what Orbital is projecting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the first half of this year, Orbital reported revenue of $264 million, up 19 percent from $221.4 million in the first half of 1996. Profit rose 54 percent to $10.7 million (33 cents a share) from $7 million (26 cents) in the same period a year earlier.\n\nOrbital's revenue will get a boost toward its $600 million-a-year goal later this month, when the company completes its acquisition of the satellite business of CTA Inc. of McLean. Privately owned CTA has built about two dozen small satellites, took in $80 million in revenue from that business last year and has a $150 million backlog of orders.\n\nOrbital's backlog well exceeds $1 billion. With that much business lined up, Orbital executives say they can be relatively confident in predicting revenue will grow by at least 20 percent a year and earnings per share will grow at about twice that rate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrbital this year expects revenue of about $500 million from its primary business of building rockets, satellites, satellite equipment, ground stations and other gear that the company calls \"space infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother $100 million will come from satellite access products, primarily GPS receivers sold by Magellan Corp., Orbital's California-based subsidiary. The Rockwell acquisition will put Orbital's on-board navigation into cars, a far bigger market than recreational boating and hiking.\n\nThough selling GPS navigation systems for cars seems to be a long way from building rockets and satellites, Thompson said both reflect the goal upon which Orbital Sciences was founded: providing low-cost access to space.\n\nThe company got its start building small rockets and small satellites. Its flagship Pegasus rocket looks like an overgrown World War II German buzz bomb. Instead of blasting off from earth, it is carried aloft beneath a cargo plane. The rocket drops off the plane at high altitude, then ignites, flies into a low orbit and delivers its payload of up to eight small satellites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom a hardware builder, Orbital is evolving into a satellite services company. Much of its growth is expected to come from two new ventures: OrbView, a trio of satellites that take pictures of the earth; and Orbcomm, a flock of 28 satellites that will provide low-cost data communications services.\n\nOrbcomm is a partnership with Teleglobe Inc. of Canada. Its first two satellites are up and 26 more are scheduled to be launched in the next nine months.\n\nThe services businesses have the potential to provide much higher profit margins than manufacturing, Thompson said. Orbcomm, for example, can break even operating at just 5 percent of its full capacity.\n\nGetting the first 5 percent of the business is the tough part, Thompson conceded, because it requires making big capital investments and then creating markets for new kinds of satellite communications services -- such as sending e-mail to cars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The satellite business is inherently a long-term one,\" he explained. \"A certain amount of patience is required, over and above what's required in other high tech businesses. It's kind of like a rocket -- you need to spend a fair amount of time on the launchpad before you lift off, but once you do, you go really fast.\"\n\nThough Orbital Sciences was founded in 1982 and went public in 1991, it is only now beginning to take off, Thompson said. It has been a long wait for shareholders. From 1991 to last December, while the value of the average Nasdaq stock grew by 127 percent, Orbital stock was up 23 percent.\n\nThat appears to be why Wall Street has so little enthusiasm for satellite stocks in general and Orbital Sciences in particular. The blunt assessment of analyst Robert Kaimowitz of New York's Unterberg Harris is that \"Orbital has no track record of creating shareholder value.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one knows that better than CEO and founder Thompson, who now owns only about 1 percent of Orbital's stock because the company has had to sell so many of its shares to raise capital for the business. \"You're not going to be able to hold on to a big percentage of the equity if you're building a long-term enterprise,\" he shrugs.\n\nBut even skeptics like Kaimowitz say that as a result of developments in the past month \"it looks like they're making progress\" at Orbital Sciences. \"What they have now is a company, that if it works on all cylinders, can probably be one of the players in the small satellite market.\" CAPTION:ORBITAL: NOT JUST ROCKETS ANYMORE Part of Orbital's strategy is to diversify its business away from the low-cost launch vehicles that became its trademark. 1992 Launch vehicles 85% Satellites 12% Ground systems 2% Satellite services 1% PROJECTED 1998 Satellite access products 20% Satellites 20% Launch vehicles 20% Ground systems 15% Sensors, electronics 15% Satellite services 10% SOURCE: Orbital Sciences CAPTION: An early Orbital Sciences rocket ready for launch."
