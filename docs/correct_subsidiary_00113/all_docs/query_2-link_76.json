        "text": "Speaker Bios A-Z\n\nArnold D. Aldrich\n\nArnold D. Aldrich joined the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center (LaRC), Langley Field, Virginia six months after the award of the contract to build the Mercury Spacecraft and four months following the selection of the seven original astronauts. Aldrich held a number of key flight operations management positions at LaRC and subsequently at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas dur­ing the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo manned space programs. Subsequently, he served as Deputy Manager for the Skylab Program; Apollo Spacecraft Deputy Program Manager during the Apollo Soyuz Test Project with the Soviet Union; Space Shuttle Orbiter Project Manager where he oversaw 15 successful flights as well as the construction of the orbiters Discovery and Atlantis; and as Space Shuttle Program Manager.\n\nFollowing the Challenger ac­cident, Aldrich was appointed Director of the National Space Transportation System (Space Shuttle Program) at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC, where he led Space Shuttle Program re­covery and return-to-flight efforts. He approved and oversaw the implementation of over 500 improvements to Space Shuttle flight and support systems which contributed significantly to 88 consecutive successful flights over the following 14.5 years.\n\nIn 1988, Aldrich was appointed NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology where he oversaw NASA efforts on the National Aerospace Plane (NASP), the High Speed Civil Transport and was responsible for program and institutional activities at the NASA Langley, Lewis, Ames and Dryden research centers. Subsequently, he was appointed NASA Associate Administrator for Space Systems Development, overseeing the Space Station Freedom program, development of the Space Shuttle Super Lightweight External Tank and other space system technology initiatives including single-stage-to-orbit concepts and feasibility. He also led political and technical initiatives with Russia leading to the incorporation of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft as the on-orbit emergency rescue vehicle for the International Space Station.\n\nIn 1994, Aldrich left NASA and joined Lockheed Missiles and Space Company in Sunnyvale, California where he served as Vice President, Commercial Space Business Development and subsequently as Vice President, Strategic Technology Plan­ning. With the merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta, he joined Lockheed Mar­tin corporate headquarters in Bethesda, Mary­land where he oversaw X-33/Venturestar single-stage-to-orbit program activities. Later, he became Director of Program Operations and pursued a broad array of initiatives to enhance program management capabilities across the Corporation.\n\nMr. Aldrich retired in 2007 and is currently an aerospace consultant. He has re­ceived numerous honors during his career including the Presidential Rank of Distinguished Ex­ecutive and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (3 times). He is a member of the International Academy of Astronautics and an Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\nMichael Collins\n\nCollins chose an Air Force career following graduation from West Point. He served as an experimental flight test officer at the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, California, and, in that capacity, tested performance and stability and control characteristics of Air Force aircraft--primarily jet fighters. He has logged approximately 5,000 hours flying time.\n\nCollins was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA in October 1963. He served as backup pilot for the Gemini VII mission. As pilot on the 3-day Gemini X mission, launched July 18, 1966, Collins shared with command pilot John Young in the accomplishments of that record-setting flight. These accomplishments included a successful rendezvous and docking with a separately launched Agena target vehicle and, using the power of the Agena, maneuvering the Gemini spacecraft into another orbit for a rendezvous with a second, passive Agena. Collins' skillful performance in completing two periods of extravehicular activity included the recovery of a micrometeorite detection experiment from the passive Agena. Gemini X attained an apogee of approximately 475 statute miles and traveled a distance of 1,275,091 statute miles--after which splashdown occurred in the West Atlantic, 529 miles east of Cape Kennedy. The spacecraft landed 2.6 miles from the USS GUADALCANAL and became the second spacecraft in the Gemini program to land within eye and camera range of the prime recovery ship. Collins served as command module pilot on Apollo 11, July 16-24, 1969--the first lunar landing mission. He remained aboard the command module , \"Columbia,\" on station in lunar orbit while Neil Armstrong , spacecraft commander, and Edwin Aldrin, lunar module pilot, descended to the lunar surface in their lunar module \"Eagle.\" Collins performed the final redocking maneuvers following a successful lunar orbit rendezvous which was initiated by Armstrong and Aldrin from within the \"Eagle\" after their ascent from the lunar surface. Among the accomplishments of the Apollo 11 mission were collection of lunar surface samples for return to earth, deployment of lunar surface experiments, and an extensive evaluation of the life supporting extravehicular mobility unit worn by astronauts. Collins completed two space flights, logging 266 hours in space--of which 1 hour and 27 minutes was spent in EVA.\n\nHe left NASA in January 1970, and is Director of the National Air & Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, D.C. Member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
