Dr. DeLucas devoted a significant amount of time in impoverished regions of Brazil, giving inspirational talks to students in elementary schools and high schools and to the public.\n\nMichael Lucas\n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate, Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, University of Tennessee, Knoxville\n\nMichael Peter Lucas was born in Leesburg, Virginia and was raised in his hometown of Annandale, Virginia. Michael attended St. Michael's Catholic School in Annandale through the eighth grade. Despite very little coursework in science at catholic school, Michael realized when he was \"knee-high\" that he would become a scientist. Michael attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria, VA, where he joined the astronomy club and competed in athletics on the track team.\n\nMichael became a founding staff member of Florida Gulf Coast University, where he co-founded the Evelyn L. Egan Astronomical Observatory that was built on the campus of that institution in 2002. Shortly thereafter in 2003 he earned his B.A. in Geology at the University of South Florida (USF). Before returning to USF for graduate studies, Michael enjoyed a successful laboratory career, first as a chemist at the lab bench, then as a manager in various private and governmental laboratory settings. Michael earned his M.S. in Geology at USF in 2011 and afterward moved to Knoxville, TN to pursue a Ph.D. in Planetary Science in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee (UTK), where he earned his doctorate in 2017.\n\nMichael has held numerous fellowships throughout his academic career, including a Florida Space Grant Fellowship and the Richard H. Davis Endowed Fellowship in Geology during his master's program. During his doctoral program at UTK, he was awarded an Oscar R. Ashley Fellowship and was also a NASA Earth and Space Science Fellow. Michael currently is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences, UTK, where he uses the mineralogic, geochemical, and spectral analyses of meteorites, integrated with astronomical observations of their asteroid parent bodies using ground-based telescopes, to explore the petrogenesis, composition, and evolution of the early Solar System. Michael owns too many backyard telescopes, enjoys music, backpacking, and model rocketry. Michael believes strongly in public service and stays active in cancer patient advocacy and outreach.\n\nMost asteroids are very far away, making it difficult to ascertain their compositions. The direct method to determine the composition of an asteroid is to send a spacecraft to grab a sample from its surface and deliver it back to Earth. But, sample return missions are expensive, and presently only a few asteroids are targeted for sample return missions. Conveniently, meteorites are pieces of asteroids and therefore represent essentially \"free\" asteroid samples. These samples represent \"time capsules\" for the study of the early evolution of the Solar System. Furthermore, the study of asteroids is greatly aided by ground-based telescopes, which are highly useful in the field of asteroid science because the number of objects is so great (~1.5 x 106 asteroids >1 km in the Main Belt) that only a tiny fraction can ever be visited by spacecraft. In lieu of asteroid sample return missions, the mineralogical and spectral study of meteorites in the laboratory, combined with ground-based telescopic spectral observations of asteroids, affords the best possibility of linking meteorite groups with the surface composition of their parent asteroid(s).\n\nIn his presentation, Dr. Lucas will begin with background material on establishing asteroid-meteorite connections using both ground-based telescopes and the laboratory analysis of meteorites. The presentation will then focus on asteroid science using ground-based observatories. Dr. Lucas will describe the results of his comprehensive telescopic spectral survey entitled Hungaria Asteroid Region Telescopic Spectral Survey (HARTSS), where he investigated the surface compositions and meteorite analogs of 92 Hungaria asteroids. Next, the focus of the presentation will shift to the laboratory to describe Dr. Lucas' work on developing correlations between the mineralogy and spectral properties of primitive achondrite meteorites, specifically the acapulcoite-lodranite clan. Finally, Dr. Lucas will present his latest research regarding the thermal histories of ordinary chondrite (H, L, and LL) parent asteroids. This work uses a novel Rare-Earth-Element (REE) thermometric method to show that parent bodies of ordinary chondrite meteorites most likely experienced violent thermal histories, which involved fragmentation-reassembly, rather than quiescent thermal histories required by the classic onion shell model.\n\nJon Christopherson\n\nPrincipal Systems Engineer, USGS Earth Resources Observations and Science Center\n\nJon Christopherson is a Principal Systems Engineer with KBR, the technical services contractor to the USGS EROS Center. At EROS he is a lead in the New Missions area where they work to stay abreast of the many new Earth observing satellites being launched, their data quality, and usefulness to Science.\n\nPrior to EROS, Christopherson worked for an Aerospace and Defense company building the sensor for Landsat 7 in Santa Barbara. His career has taken him to 24 countries and all fifty states while he has lived in Southern California, Silicon Valley, Georgia, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and now South Dakota.\n\nChristopherson has a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and was in the first UND Space Studies class to get their Master's degrees via distance learning in 1998.\n\nShankar Ramaseri\n\nSystems Engineer, USGS Earth Resources Observations and Science Center\n\nShankar Ramaseri holds a Master's Degree in Space Studies from UND. He currently works as a Systems Engineer for KBR, a technical contractor to USGS EROS Center. His work at EROS is focused on researching remote sensing systems and assisting with system characterization. He also works on orbit analyses of remote sensing satellites. Shankar holds a Bachelors in Aeronautical Engineering from JNTU, India. While in India, he worked as a project engineer for Defense Research Development Organization (DRDO) researching orbits and sensors. Shankar's interests lie in studying orbital dynamics of satellites around asteroids, remote sensing, and space policy.\n\nCassandra Runyon\n\nAssociate Professor of Geology, College of Charleston, and Director, South Carolina NASA Space Grant Consortium\n\nDr. Cassandra Runyon graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1988 with her Ph.D. in Geology and Geophysics. Following graduation, she was a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA Johnson Space Center. Her research focused on understanding the nature and origin of volcanic features on the terrestrial planets. Later, as an employee of POD Associates, she used laboratory and remote sensing data to interpret and model near-Earth space debris for the National Space Council and the Department of Defense. This research helped to better understand the effects of space debris on various spacecraft materials. As a Faculty Fellow working with her colleagues at NASA Johnson Space Center, Cass helped to explore and define the initial field requirements for future human-robotic missions to the Moon and Mars. Later, after joining the College of Charleston faculty, her research used hyperspectral and multispectral data and imagery to model stressed terrestrial environments including coastal wetlands, precision farming and disturbed ground to assess urban/suburban change to South Carolina’s coastal wetlands through field reconnaissance, remote sensing, and GIS. She continues to work with NASA as a science team member and education and public engagement (E/PE) lead for the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) spectrometer onboard Chandrayaan-1, which discovered water on the Moon!\n\nShe is currently an Associate Professor of Geology at the College of Charleston, Director of the NASA SC Space Grant Consortium and SC NASA EPSCoR program and the education/public engagement lead for two NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) teams. Her passion is helping to provide access to STEM for all audiences, including those with visible and invisible disabilities.\n\nHave you or someone you know ever dreamed of doing something big - perhaps starting a business or working for the aerospace industry and/or NASA? You (they) can. Have you or someone you know been challenged by a visible or invisible disability thinking it may be a career-breaking barrier that may not be overcome? You (they) can! The old adage, \"where there is a will, there is a way\" is true! Recognizing, understanding, and being willing to work through - and with - life’s challenges along the way is paramount. As an educator, employer, or friend, we can help to facilitate and include those with exceptional needs so that reaching for their star career choice is an option.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nThe humans that will explore the far reaches of space will experience unprecedented biological, physiological, and psychological challenges brought on by extreme environmental exposures. The NASA Human Research Program pursues research that characterizes the effects of these hazardous exposures and is responsible for developing and validating mitigation strategies that reduce the risk to the humans and the mission. In my presentation I will describe the hazards of spaceflight, including the exposure to altered gravity fields, a closed environment, isolation and confinement, and galactic cosmic radiation. I will also discuss that while humans are extremely adaptable, these exposures could lead to significant health and performance decrements during the mission and later in life long after the mission is complete. The NASA Human Research Program refers to these decrements as human system risks and uses this construct to describe our portfolio of work. I will also describe how we continue to do surveillance of the experience during human spaceflight to enable the identification of new and emerging risks. The final piece of the presentation will provide an overview of how the NASA Human Research Program interacts with researchers from academia and industry.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nThis presentation will explore the concept of non-interference zones for space activities and how this concept produces an inevitable constraint on policy- and decision-makers planning future space activities. Generally, non-interference zones are volumes of space around spacecraft and/or space activities determined by a set of criteria that creates a location or relative position of exclusivity for the operator. The murky question of whether this idea is in accordance with the outer space treaty system and/or US law and policy is gaining some clarity. And while the legal considerations are important, the realities of physics and mathematics place a limitation on the flexibility of the criteria for non-interference zones to handle the proliferation of new operators and activities, and this raises the important question about the degree of exclusivity that is permissible and expected. This issue will have major implications for future mission and architectural designs and set the development cadence of space settlement on a celestial body. Adjusting to the space environment will be key to ensure successful operations on the Moon or other celestial bodies, but the physical limitations of the space environment highlight the need to keep discussions surrounding the cadence of this new space race ongoing because, eventually, we will run out of space.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nA scientific approach to the human exploration of Mars began in 1952 with the publication of Wernher von Braun’s Das Marsprojekt, which described the mathematics necessary to enable interplanetary travel. The English-language version (The Mars Project) led to a series of articles in Collier’s, a weekly magazine with a tradition of influencing public opinion and government policy. The series, titled Man Will Conquer Space Soon! was published in eight, beautifully-illustrated installments between 1952 and 1954. Those articles inspired Walt Disney to recruit von Braun and other experts for three episodes of the wildly-popular Disneyland television program; the third episode, Mars and Beyond, was broadcast in December 1957, two months after the Soviet Union shocked the world with the launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, which led directly to the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA has been designing equipment, space suits, and space habitats, and preparing plans for the human exploration of Mars since the agency was formed in 1958. Thousands of scientists and engineers at NASA, universities, and aerospace contractors have worked on dozens of plans for a human expedition to Mars since then. However, no one actually identified the tasks that would likely be performed by the explorers, until now.\n\nDr. Jack Stuster will present the results of a three-year study that addresses several NASA risks by identifying the work that will be performed during an expedition to Mars and the abilities, skills, and knowledge that will be required of crew members. The study began by developing a comprehensive inventory of 1,125 tasks that are likely to be performed during the 12 phases of the first human expeditions to Mars, from launch to landing more than 30 months later. Sixty subject matter experts (including UND faculty and graduate students) rated expedition tasks in terms of frequency, difficulty to learn, and importance to mission success. Seventy-two SMEs placed the physical, cognitive, and social abilities necessary to perform the tasks in order of importance for eight specialist domains identified by the task analysis. The research team then identified, 1) Abilities, skills, and knowledge that can be generalized across tasks, 2) Cross-training strategies, and 3) Implications for crew size and composition, and for the design of equipment, suits, habitats, and procedures to support sustained human performance during exploration-class space missions. The days of describing an interplanetary mission plan with detailed mathematical calculations and a few sentences of speculation about the humans who would make the journey are gone.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nThe development and utilization of space resources will enable an economic transformation for humankind on par with the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution. The development and utilization of space resources will liberate humankind from the resource constraints of a finite earth and usher an era of unprecedented economic growth and prosperity. The first steps along this road are the development of the resources of the Moon and near-Earth asteroids to create a self-sustaining economy in cislunar space. The first economically-viable resource in cislunar space will be rocket propellant from water mined on the Moon or asteroids. Recent research at the Colorado School of Mines shows that mining water for propellant in the permanently-shadowed regions of the Moon is feasible at costs that can meet the requirements of a purely commercial business case. Once space-sourced propellants are available, the cost of transportation in cislunar space plummets, enabling other space businesses to become viable. Space-based solar power, beaming unlimited clean energy to Earth, is just one example.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nStephen Johnstone\n\nChemCam Mission Operations Lead, Intelligence and Space Research Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, NASA-JPL\n\nStephen Johnstone is the lead mission operations engineer at Los Alamos National Lab for the ChemCam instrument suite currently exploring the Martian surface onboard NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover. A graduate of the UND Space Studies Department (M.S. 1997), Stephen also has degrees in Planetary Geology (B.A. 1994) and Space Systems Engineering (M.S. 2012), and has been involved with 18 space vehicle launches and their on-orbit and planetary surface operations. In addition, Stephen is a participating member of the Mars Human Landing Site Selection Working Group that is researching the best location for the first human outpost. In support of this work, Stephen is involved with a small group of researchers developing neutron spectrometer hardware for Mars applications that can provide high-resolution data with the aim of locating and quantifying the abundance of near-subsurface water ice on Mars. In addition, Stephen is an active instructor pilot at Kirtland Air Force Base, supporting training of military and civilian pilots. He is researching the effectiveness of flight simulation in aviation and spaceflight scenarios related to stress, complacency, and fatigue on piloting procedures for both terrestrial and planetary missions.\n\nMichael Dodge\n\nAssistant Professor, Space Studies Department, University of North Dakota\n\nMichael S. Dodge currently serves as an Assistant Professor and Graduate Program Director in the Department of Space Studies at the University of North Dakota. Prof. Dodge obtained his J.D. from the University of Mississippi School of Law (2008), and his LL.M. in Air & Space Law at McGill Faculty of Law in Montreal, Canada (2011), where he wrote a thesis on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and the GPS-Galileo Agreement. Prof. Dodge is formerly Research Counsel and Instructor in the LL.M. in Air & Space Law Program at the University of Mississippi School of Law, where he taught courses in aviation law, remote sensing law and regulation, as well as domestic and international space law. At the University of North Dakota, he teaches courses that include space law, history of the space age, space politics & policy, space & the environment, and remote sensing law & regulation. He has been a contributor to several aviation and space law focused journals, and is also an Editor of the Journal of Space Law. Prof. Dodge has also coached teams participating in the prestigious Manfred Lachs Space Law Moot Court competition, where his team won the international championship in 2015. Since then, he has helped to judge for the North American round of the Lachs Moot Court. His research interests include the environmental management of outer space, global navigation satellite systems, the concept of sovereignty and ownership rights in space (including the law and policy of mining celestial bodies), and the law and regulation of remote sensing technologies.\n\nA common trope in science fiction is the concept of humankind \"slipping the surly bonds of Earth,\" and coming to live and work in outer space. Indeed, as the world's nations become increasingly dependent on space, policymakers and legislators have begun to see space, and its celestial bodies, as a means to satisfy curiosity, expand knowledge, and obtain precious resources. In the mid-twentieth century, the United Nations proposed a series of treaties to govern humanity's burgeoning pursuit of space, and these documents, beginning with the esteemed Outer Space Treaty, continue to influence the activities of nations the world over. The treaty regime established several critical principles for the uses of space, and noted, amongst its primary articles, that neither outer space, nor its celestial bodies, could become \"appropriated\" territory for any country. Left unstated by those treaties, however, was the extent to which nations, or the people for whom they were responsible, were permitted to use the resources found on celestial bodies. For the past several years, multiple efforts have been made at the level of the United States Congress to initiate the exploration and exploitation of space resources. Some rules were proposed but rejected, whereas others were passed into law. The common theme of these rules was that celestial bodies in general, and asteroids in particular, are ripe for resource extraction programs. While much of the brouhaha surrounding these congressional activities concerns the use of asteroids by private, commercial companies, the story is much more complex than one first surmises. Indeed, if humanity is to continue the pursuit of lengthy stays in space, or if it wishes to extend its reach to other planets with human explorers, using asteroids as waystations or resource providers may be inevitable. This talk will analyze the extent to which nations and private companies may use asteroids, including the legal and policy ramifications of extracting their resources, attempting to move such bodies, and creating potential markets.\n\nSheryl L. Bishop\n\nProfessor, Nursing Doctoral Program and Director, Biobehavioral Research Laboratory, University of Texas Medical Branch\n\nSheryl L. Bishop, Ph.D. is a Professor of the University of Texas Medical Branch's Schools of Nursing and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences since 1992. Since 1996, Dr. Bishop has served as lecturer, faculty, and co-chair for the master's program and summer space studies program for the Departments of Space Life Science and Space and Society at the International Space University, Strasbourg, France. As an internationally-recognized behavioral researcher in extreme environments, for the last 25 years Dr. Bishop has investigated human performance and group dynamics in teams in extreme, unusual environments, involving deep cavers, mountain climbers, desert survival groups, polar expeditioners, Antarctic winter-over groups, and various simulations of isolated, confined environments for space, including a number of missions at remote habitats (e.g. Mars Desert Research Station, Utah, and FMARS and the Mars Project on Devon Island, Canada). She has been a grant reviewer for the European Space Agency's Concordia Station, the Canadian Space Agency's Life Science Directorate, the Australian Antarctic Science Division, and the Czech Science Foundation. She routinely presents her research at numerous scientific conferences, has over 60 publications (including contribution to NASA's latest Historical Series on Psychology in Space), and over 50 scholarly presentations in both the medical and psychological fields. She is frequently sought out as a content expert by various media and has participated in several television documentaries on space and extreme environments by Discovery Channel, BBC, and 60 Minutes. Dr. Bishop is a founding member, Board of Trustee member, and Senior Editor for the Journal of the Society of Human Performance in Extreme Environments, Contributing Editor for Life Sciences for Habitation (formerly the Journal of Life Support and Biospheric Sciences), and Review Editor for the Journal of Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance (formerly Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine) among numerous others.\n\nTo boldly go...! But with lots of preparation, planning, testing, and educated guesswork. Yet, just how DO you prepare crews for an experience that has never been encountered in the history of humankind... leaving our entire world and every other member of our species unequivocally behind as we reach for the next stepping stone in our expansion to the stars?\n\nOne approach is to try living and working in space from a nearby off-earth location. Our progress along this line has resulted in a couple of small orbiting space stations hosting 2-3 persons (hardly a \"group\") with more ease of rescue and assistance than our Antarctic bases down below. Given the limited access to the space frontier and the investment in collective effort and resources, our ability to study individual and group functioning in the actual space environment has been, and will continue to be, severely limited. Until we can establish more permanent and larger facilities on the moon or in orbit, our knowledge of how to train groups for long-duration missions will also be limited. The second approach is through analogs, i.e. locations here on Earth that are characterized by some of the critical features we expect to be a part of any long duration mission: isolation, confinement, and extreme environments with both known and unknown dangers. Studies on real-world groups situated in extreme environments here on Earth have provided us insight into many factors that impact group performance, health, and well-being. Not only have we expanded our knowledge about the things we knew were problems, but we've also discovered a number of issues that were not obvious. Thus, studying groups in terrestrial extreme environments as analogues has been a productive way to provide predictive insight into the things that we need to prepare for in long-duration space missions.\n\nAnalogs come in two broad categories: artificial situations called simulations that we construct, and those that real-world environments provide for us. Simulations provide a great deal of control over the kinds of things that crews are experiencing, which allows us to study specific conditions with a great deal of precision. Unlike simulation studies, real-world environments are very chaotic but provide very real environmental threats, physical hardship, as well as true isolation and confinement - all of which have proven to be key factors in individual and group coping. To demonstrate the usefulness of the various types of analogs in use today, results from several analog studies undertaken by the author (e.g., deep caving, desert survival teams, mountain climbers, Mars Desert Research Station, Antarctic and Arctic stations) will be presented, focusing on interpersonal, environmental, and individual factors that affected functioning and well-being at both the physiological and psychological levels.\n\nJack Stuster, Ph.D., CPE is a cultural anthropologist and Certified Professional Ergonomist (CPE #0093), specializing in the measurement and enhancement of human performance in extreme environments. He has analyzed the work performed by telecommunications technicians, military specialists, and astronauts. His research for NASA began in 1982 with a systems analysis of space shuttle refurbishing procedures and has been followed by studies of conditions that are analogous to space missions, which led to recommendations to facilitate human performance on the International Space Station, space craft, and at planetary facilities. Dr. Stuster's research concerning Antarctic winter-over experiences, expeditions, and voyages of discovery, is documented in Bold Endeavors: Lessons From Polar and Space Exploration. Dr. Stuster also contributed to the development of a training program for the Expedition Corps, astronauts selected for long-duration space missions, and since 2003, has conducted content analyses of confidential journals maintained for this purpose by astronauts during their six-month tours-of-duty onboard the ISS. Dr. Stuster recently began studies to evaluate methods for unobtrusively monitoring crew behavioral health and to identify the skills and abilities necessary for an expedition to Mars.\n\nThe NASA Systems Engineering Research Consortium was formed at the end of 2010 to study the approaches to producing elegant systems on a consistent basis. This has been a transformative study looking at the engineering and organizational basis of systems engineering. The consortium has engaged in a variety of research topics to determine the path to elegant systems. In the second year of the consortium, a systems engineering framework emerged which structured the approach to systems engineering and guided our research. This led, in the third year, to a set of systems engineering postulates that the consortium is continuing to refine. The consortium has conducted several research projects that have contributed significantly to the understanding of systems engineering. The consortium has surveyed the application of the NASA 17 systems engineering processes, explored the physics and statistics of systems integration, and considered organizational aspects of systems engineering discipline integration. The systems integration methods have included system exergy analysis, Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), State Variable Analysis, Multidisciplinary Coupling Analysis (MCA), Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO), System Cost Modeling, System Robustness, and Value Modeling. Organizational studies have included application of sociology principles to systems engineering, the variability of processes in change evaluations, margin management within the organization, information theory of board structures, social categorization of unintended consequences, and initial looks at applying cognitive science to systems engineering. Consortium members have also studied the bidirectional influence of policy and law with systems engineering.\n\nPlanetary science missions are among the most complex systems that humanity builds, are developed over three to ten years, cost hundreds of millions to billions of dollars, and have fixed launch periods. Projects are formulated to address specific scientific objectives that drive planetary science forward, but also are influenced by technical, political, and cultural factors. The development of projects are complex affairs that are typically dominated by large engineering teams that are needed to design and build the spacecraft.\n\nScientists advise the project during this phase by drafting science requirements that define what the spacecraft must do, defining the environments the spacecraft must operate in, and building scientific instruments to make the observations needed to address the scientific objectives. The science team is led by a Project Scientist or Principal Investigator and includes instrument Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators, Participating Scientists, and collaborators.\n\nThe operations phase of projects typically includes most of the science team participating in an orchestrated process designed to make timely strategic and tactical decisions to acquire the data needed to answer the science objectives of the mission.\n\nMonitoring of global croplands (GCs) is imperative for ensuring sustainable water and food security for the people of the world in the twenty-first century. However, the currently-available cropland products suffer from major limitations, such as (1) absence of precise spatial location of the cropped areas, (2) coarse resolution nature of the map products and their significant uncertainties in areas, locations, and detail, (3) uncertainties in differentiating irrigated areas from rainfed areas, (4) absence of crop types and cropping intensities, and (5) absence of a dedicated web-based data portal for dissemination of the cropland map products.\n\nThis research aims to overcome the above-mentioned limitations through development of a set of Global Food Security-support analysis data at 30m (GFSAD30) resolution consisting of four distinct products:\n\nCropland extent/area\n\nCrop types with focus on the 8 types that occupy 70% of the global cropland areas\n\nIrrigated versus rainfed croplands\n\nCropping intensities: single, double, triple, and continuous cropping\n\nThese products are produced using multi-resolution time-series remotely-sensed data and a suite of automated and/or semi-automated cropland mapping algorithms (ACMAs). Data include Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series and Landsat Time-series from various epochs. Methods include Spectral Matching Techniques (SMTs), Automated Cropland Classification Algorithms (ACCAs), Decision Tree Algorithms (DTAs), and Linear Discriminant Analysis Algorithms (LDAA). Massively Large Big Data (MLBD) are computed on several platforms that include parallel computing over NASA NEX supercomputers and Google Earth Engine (GEE). Large volumes of ground data are sourced through various crowdsourcing mechanisms and integrated on a web platform (croplands.org).\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST), part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, has licensed over 230 launches since 1989. The FAA licenses, regulates, and promotes U.S. commercial space transportation, including expendable launch vehicles, new reusable launch vehicles that can carry people such as Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo and XCOR's Lynx, and the operation of non-federal launch sites, or what are more commonly known as commercial spaceports. There are 9 licensed spaceports in the U.S.\n\nAlthough the FAA licenses launch and reentry for public safety, it does not have authority for in-orbit space transportation. In addition, unlike for passenger aircraft, FAA/AST does not have authority to protect people onboard commercial space vehicles nor does it certify vehicles. In 2014, the FAA issued \"Recommended Practices for Human Space Flight Occupant Safety,\" a document which could serve as a foundation for future regulations, if needed.\n\nThere are about 30 \"pre-application consultations\" that are on-going with AST, including proposals for new vehicles, new spaceports, safety approvals, and requests for payload reviews. AST staff has grown to 81 people with a budget request to add more in FY 2016. With NASA increasingly shifting to commercial launch services for supply of the International Space Station (and return) and soon for astronaut crew transfer, the visibility of the commercial space transportation industry has increased.\n\nBoth NASA and FAA have worked closely together to define their respective oversight responsibilities in the successful Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program and are currently working together in the Commercial Crew Program. Separately, the FAA is promoting its regulations for international adoption as suborbital companies market their services outside the United States. All of these indicators are a sign of U.S. industry growth and generate new issues for the FAA.\n\nThis presentation will cover an introduction to FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation and policy issues faced by the office and commercial industry, including gaps in regulatory authority. The presentation will also include the competitive position of the U.S. in the global commercial launch services market and FAA's international goals.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nThe InSight mission to Mars, the twelfth mission in NASA's Discovery Program, will launch from Vandenberg AFB in California in March of 2016. It will land six months later in Elysium Planitia to begin a two-year primary mission. It reuses much of the design from the previous Phoenix mission to control cost and risk, two things that are critical for the selection and success of a cost-capped Discovery mission.\n\nUnlike previous missions to Mars, which have focused on surface features and chemistry, InSight aims to explore the interior of the planet down to its very core. The planet Mars is a keystone in our quest for understanding the early processes of terrestrial planet formation and evolution. Unlike the Earth, its overall structure appears to be relatively unchanged since a few hundred million years after formation. Unlike the Moon, it is large enough that the pressure-temperature conditions within the planet span an appreciable fraction of the terrestrial planet range. Thus, the large-scale chemical and structural evidence within Mars should tell us a great deal about the processes of planetary differentiation and thermal evolution.\n\nInSight will pursue its fundamental science goals by performing the first comprehensive surface-based geophysical measurements on Mars, using seismology, precision tracking, and heat flow measurements. The limitation to a single location provides challenges to traditional seismology, which can be overcome with the application of single-station techniques that have been developed for terrestrial observations.\n\nThe two defining characteristics of the planet Venus are its atmospheric super-rotation and the planet-enshrouding cloud layers. The clouds reflect more than 70% of the incident solar flux back into space, but about half of the solar flux that is received by the planet is absorbed at the altitudes occupied by the clouds. But for its massive greenhouse effect, the planet Venus would be even cooler than Earth, despite being located closer to the Sun.\n\nThe clouds play a pivotal role here too, as they are the fourth-largest contributor to this greenhouse effect, following CO2, H2O, and SO2. Thus, a large fraction of the incident solar flux and a significant fraction of the upwelling infrared flux are absorbed by the Venusian cloud layers. This energy deposition possibly plays a significant role in sustaining the global super-rotation of Venus, in which the entire atmosphere circles the planet with periods of as little as four days at the cloud tops. However, these clouds are also highly variable, especially when viewed at ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths.\n\nIn this talk, I discuss the value of multispectral analysis of Venus in characterizing the properties of the planet's clouds and their role in the global energy and momentum budgets, especially when coupled with in situ measurements of the clouds themselves.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nThe Moon continues to provide scientific answers - and pose new questions - over 40 years after the last Apollo mission. While the Moon provides the most clear and complete history of impact events in the inner Solar System since its formation ~4.5 billion years (Ga) ago, the timing is not well-understood and has been a topic of continued interest and persistent uncertainties. As our closest planetary neighbor, the Moon's impact record, if properly interpreted, can be used to gain insights into how the Earth has been influenced by impacting events over billions of years.\n\nLunar impact glasses, pieces of melted lunar regolith created by energetic impacting events, can offer information about the Moon's impact history. These samples possess the composition of the target material and can be dated by the 40Ar/39Ar (argon) method in order to determine their formation age. Understanding the ages of impact glasses, along with their compositions, allows us to begin to piece together information about the rate of impact events in the inner Solar System and their effects on Earth.\n\nImportant questions that can be answered include determining the form of the large-impact distribution with respect to time (e.g. smooth decline versus cataclysmic spike), whether there is periodicity in Earth-Moon cratering history, and the applicability of the lunar record to other planets. Of great interest to astrobiology and the study of the origin of life is the impact flux prior to ~3.7 Ga ago, and specifically, whether or not early life, if it existed on Earth before 4.0 Ga ago, may have been destroyed during these early impact events.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nThe psychological criteria used to select international crews for lunar and Mars exploration missions has been a subject of considerable discussion. Strategies for maintaining optimal functioning during the mission also present considerable challenges. A change in emphasis in the initial astronaut applicant screening process is needed, from ruling out psychopathology to identifying adaptive personality traits to enhance individual and group performance over an extended period of time.\n\nDuring the mission, psychological dysfunction and crew conflicts among highly-diverse, mixed-gender, and cultural crews need to be anticipated and dealt with. Computer-interactive intervention programs show considerable potential to reduce intra- and inter-personal problems during the mission, and may be more \"consumer friendly\" in a space agency culture in which disclosure of personal issues can have negative consequences. Studies of polar expedition teams as an analog of planetary exploration can inform about adaptive personality traits and decision-making processes in extreme environments.\n\nFindings from a longitudinal study of the Danish Sirius Patrol teams operating in Greenland indicated the importance of systematic interpersonal communication training prior to the start of a long-duration mission. In addition, considering the 2.5 year length of a Mars mission, it is possible that significant negative events in the home environment may occur that have a deleterious effect on work performance and interpersonal interactions with other crew members.\n\nSpace travel to Mars, even for early fly-by missions, will require meeting all the life support needs of the human crew. This includes oxygen, food, and clean water. Bioregenerative life support approaches for space, such as using plants to generate oxygen and food have been discussed for many years, and become increasingly cost-effective for longer-duration missions. But even \"shorter\" missions, such as a Mars fly-by could benefit from the inclusion of plants for supplemental, fresh foods.\n\nThe plants could provide a constant source of high-value, perishable fruits and vegetables to improve the nutrition and acceptability of the diet. These plants might be grown in growth chambers that could range from 0.5-5 m2 of growing area, depending on the vehicle size and available power to operate electric lighting.\n\nAlternatively, direct solar light might be concentrated and delivered to the inside of the vehicle to sustain plant growth. Validating plant growth and assessing system reliabilities for a Mars transit mission will be an important step toward the ultimate use of larger, more autonomous bioregenerative life support approaches for long-duration surface missions on Mars. Various challenges and concepts for growing plants on Mars fly-by missions will be presented.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nNear-Earth objects are viewed primarily as hazards. One is noted for killing the dinosaurs. This February, another much smaller object exploded over the Siberian city of Chelyabinsk in Russia, injuring more than 1,500 people. The perceived threat drove Congress in 1998 to direct NASA to find 90% of asteroids having diameters exceeding 1 km. Recognizing the potential damage from another Siberian airburst over Tunguska in 1908, Congress modified their mandate in 2005 to include objects down to 140 meters in diameter.\n\nHowever, asteroids represent more than just threats. They represent the potential to expand human presence and economy beyond Earth. The Obama administration has committed to sending a crewed mission to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025 and is planning to propose that Congress allocate $100M in 2014 to begin planning for a mission to return a 5 meter object to Earth orbit. A non-profit company says it will raise hundreds of millions in donations to survey NEOs to reduce the hazard threat. Private companies have started up with the goal of mining asteroids and turning a profit. Is this the dawn of a new space age? Or business as usual?\n\nChanges in ice sheet thicknesses, sea level, and sea ice extent have been explicitly identified as a current priority in the President's Climate Change Science Program, the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, the 4th Assessment Report of the IPCC, and other national and international policy documents. In response, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) formulated the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission to continue the exploration and understanding of our planet. The ICESat-2 is a remote sensing satellite mission providing coverage of the Earth's surfaces.\n\nThe ICESat-2 mission will provide multi-year elevation data needed to determine ice sheet mass balance. It will also provide topography and vegetation data around the globe, in addition to the polar-specific coverage over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nThe ICESat-2 observatory is comprised of one instrument, a laser altimeter called ATLAS (Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System). ATLAS is a laser altimeter, utilizing a measurement technique known as photon counting, which is designed to measure ice-sheet topography and associated temporal changes.\n\nThis presentation will focus on the role of ICESat-2 mission as we monitor the changes in the global cryosphere and the generation and subsequent distribution of data products to the user community. An overview of the mission will also be presented.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nRecent military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo indicate space capabilities have become a foundational enabler of most U.S. military actions and an increasingly important component of U.S. national security. Worldwide, there is growing recognition and focus on the broad and ubiquitous contributions space capabilities make to global prosperity and security. The 2001 Space Commission Report found that because U.S. military and economic security has become so dependent on space capabilities, the nation could face a \"space Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nThe U.S. National Space Policy released in October 2006 stated: \"In this new century, those who effectively utilize space will enjoy added prosperity and security and will hold a substantial advantage over those who do not. Freedom of action in space is as important to the United States as air power and sea power.\" And the National Space Policy of the United States of America released in June 2010 indicates: \"Space systems allow people and governments around the world to see with clarity, communicate with certainty, navigate with accuracy, and operate with assurance.\"\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nOn February 1, 2010, the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2011 was released. NASA received an increase, unlike almost any other federal agency. At the same time, the budget revealed that the Constellation Program would be canceled and that NASA would look to private sector providers for transportation of cargo, and eventually crew members, to the International Space Station. The Constellation Program had included a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, and the program plans called for a permanent surface facility capable of supporting human explorers. In the FY2011 announcement, the prescription of a lunar objective was replaced by a concept called \"flexible path\" that was advertised to open possibilities of other types of human missions beyond low-Earth orbit.\n\nThe policy direction has polarized the U.S. space community, where the reactions have been swift and polemical. The new policy has been described both as the death knell of human space exploration and as the only hope to save human space exploration. Some members of Congress have threatened legal action based on the current law regarding appropriation of funds to NASA, which states that Constellation cannot be canceled without prior consultation with Congress. As might be expected, some of the reaction is directly related to losses or gains of jobs in districts associated with NASA facilities.\n\nHowever, various statements show high emotional content, suggesting that personal belief systems have been challenged. Meanwhile, many details of the new policy are not yet clear, and some aspects seem to be shifting in response to political reaction. The final direction for NASA will not be known until the FY2011 budget has been passed by Congress and signed by the President. I will draw upon my 28 years of studying, writing, and speaking on the topic of future human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit to discuss the various issues at stake and the historical context for the debate.\n\nMy own work has had a central theme of lunar exploration and development, but I have also come to believe that human exploration will never be more than a political sideshow until a significant economic sector can be created in space off of the Earth. Disclaimer: The views presented will be my own and in no way reflect official policies of NASA.\n\nIn July 1989, on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo Moon landing, the first President Bush called for America to renew its pioneering push into space with the establishment of a permanent Lunar base and a series of human missions to Mars. While many have said that such an endeavor would be excessively costly and take many decades, a small team at Martin Marietta drew up a daring plan that could sharply cut costs and send a group of American astronauts to the Red Planet within ten years.\n\nThe plan, known as \"Mars Direct,\" has attracted international attention and broad controversy, including coverage in such publications as Newsweek, Fortune, The Economist, Air and Space Smithsonian, the New York Times, the London Times, the Boston Globe, and Izvestia. It has also been covered by the Discovery Channel, PBS, ABC, NBC, CBS, National Public Radio, and the BBC. Its principal author, Robert Zubrin, has presented it to such fora as the International Astronautical Federation congress in Germany, and the blue ribbon \"Synthesis Group\" headed by former Apollo astronaut General Thomas Stafford, the Augustine Committee, as well as to various government officials, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former NASA Administrators Dan Goldin and Mike Griffin.\n\nNow, with nations debating how to proceed with human space exploration, the \"Mars Direct\" plan is more relevant than ever: Can Americans reach the Red Planet in our time?\n\nThe first human mission to Mars will likely be humanity's greatest undertaking in space exploration in the 21st century. As with all expeditions, its success will depend on planning. The first steps towards a human journey to the Red Planet are already underway, as we explore extreme environments on Earth and prepare for new journeys to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and the moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos.\n\nDr. Pascal Lee will discuss progress being made around the world, from the Arctic to Antarctica, to achieve these milestones. He will examine in turn the what, why, when, who, and how of a human mission to Mars. Specific lessons learned from the NASA Haughton-Mars Project will be discussed.\n\nExtravehicular activity is one of the most critical areas for planetary exploration. On Mars, due to gravity conditions, dust contamination, and a specific thermal scenario, a special kind of suit is required to protect the astronauts. Since 2005, the Department of Space Studies at UND has been researching in the area of planetary space suit systems and developed the NDX-1, a Mars suit demonstrator which was tested on Earth under analog conditions.\n\nAs a result of these studies, new developments are taking place and a series of design improvements have been done to prepare a suit that can cope with the Mars conditions. Since a space suit is just part of the extravehicular system, an integrated design of the mission contemplating all different aspects of the tasks to accomplish is required. A new NASA grant is allowing the Department of Space Studies to develop a complete, minimal-mission, scenario, including inflatable habitat, airlocks, rovers, and space suit, to attempt to address all the different problems related to a human mission to Mars.\n\nA mission to Mars and return to Earth will take more than two years, possibly a lot more. The travelers will be exposed to microgravity, radiation, sensory deprivation, and other space phenomena in amounts which have never been experienced or tested before. For example, the longest stay in space microgravity, onboard the Russian space station Mir performed by Russian cosmonaut-physician Valery Polyakov, was 438 Earth days.\n\nRygalov will address questions such as how can astronauts survive this long-duration trip in hostile environments of space? How can they maintain their health for an acceptable level of performance? What are those natural mechanisms which help people to survive in extreme environments? Rygalov also will discuss available techniques and current research trends in human factors in space.\n\nThe planet Mars has been long-identified as a target for human space missions and possible human settlements. Since the 1986 discovery of possible, but very controversial, microbial fossils in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001, a fleet of unmanned spacecraft from several nations have visited the Red Planet. Although many questions remain to be resolved, we now know a great deal more about Mars than we did in 1989, when NASA, at the request of the President, outlined a scenario for a manned Mars mission.\n\nIn this presentation, we will outline the present state of knowledge concerning the nature and history of the planet Mars, with a special focus on aspects which would impact planning for a manned Mars mission and future human settlements.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nDeveloping space resources or a space business venture requires capital. Lots of it. Especially early on in the life cycle of a new business. While there are some differences in a space business as compared to a terrestrial business, there are many more similarities than one might believe. In fact, business rules are pretty much business rules, be it a space business of some type or a terrestrial business in an established industry.\n\nWhile business planning and due diligence are common, even routine in evaluating and managing terrestrial businesses, this is not so in some areas of space, particularly with the NewSpace industry. What makes NewSpace different? Why is it so hard to do real due diligence regarding all aspects of the business, not just for management or potential markets, but also technical and engineering due diligence regarding the end product of the company in question?\n\nWhy does the wish list mentality prevail and why are those applying real standards to claims, rhetoric, and PowerPoints often attacked and accused of not being with the program?\n\nThese and other issues, such as assumptions-making and commonly-used foolish terminology and rhetoric will be discussed in this presentation.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nSpaceX is revolutionizing access to space by developing a family of launch vehicles and spacecraft intended to increase the reliability and reduce the cost of both manned and unmanned space transportation. This presentation will highlight the details of the Falcon 1 (F1), Falcon 9 (F9), and Dragon programs that SpaceX is currently undertaking.\n\nFalcon 1: On September 28, 2008, the Falcon 1, designed and manufactured from the ground up by SpaceX, became the first privately-developed liquid fuel rocket to orbit the Earth. Details of the F1 vehicle will be presented along with video from the first flight.\n\nFalcon 9: As a winner of the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition (COTS), SpaceX is in a position to help fill the gap in American spaceflight to the International Space Station (ISS) when the Space Shuttle retires in 2010. The Falcon 9 Launch Vehicle is the platform that will be used to provide access to the ISS. Details of the design, manufacture, and testing of the F9 vehicle will be presented along with a video of the nine-engine, full-duration test performed in our McGregor, TX test site.\n\nDragon: The Dragon spacecraft is made up of a capsule and trunk used for Earth-to-LEO transport of cargo and/or crew members. Details of the design, manufacture, and testing of the Dragon capsule will be presented, along with samples of PICAX (a SpaceX-developed heat shield material).\n\nWhat is it about the Moon that captures the fancy of humankind? A silvery disk hanging in the night sky, it conjures up images of romance and magic. It has been counted upon to foreshadow important events, both of good and ill, and its phases for eons served humanity as its most accurate measure of time.\n\nThis presentation discusses the Moon as a target for human exploration and eventual settlement. This presentation will explore the more than 50-year efforts to reach the Moon, succeeding with space probes and humans in Project Apollo in the 1960s and early 1970s. It will then discuss the rationales for spaceflight, suggesting that human space exploration is one of the least-compelling of all that might be offered. The presentation will then discuss efforts to make the Moon a second home, including post-Apollo planning, the Space Exploration Initiative, and problems and opportunities in the 2004 Vision for Space Exploration.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nT Tauri stars are low-mass, pre-main sequence stars, many of which are still surrounded by active accretion disks where it is believed planet formation is currently under way. Stellar magnetic fields, including a strong dipole component on these newly-formed stars, are believed to play a critical role in the early evolution of the young star plus disk system. It is currently believed that the stellar magnetic field truncates the accretion disk several stellar radii above the star.\n\nThis action forces accreting material to flow along the field lines and accrete onto the star at high stellar latitudes. It is also thought that the stellar rotation rate becomes locked to the Keplerian velocity at the radius where the disk is truncated. I will review recent efforts to measure the magnetic field properties of T Tauri stars, focusing on how the observations compare with the theoretical expectations.\n\nA picture is emerging indicating that quite strong fields do indeed cover the majority of the surface on young stars; however, the dipole component of the field appears to be alarmingly small. I will also briefly discuss recent work on the origins of magnetic fields in fully-convective stars such as T Tauri stars.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nOne decade ago, the astrophysics community was shaken to its core with the announcement that the expansion rate of the Universe was speeding up rather than slowing down due to gravity. This discovery, corroborated at the time by two independent teams searching for supernovae, indicates that the Universe is filled with a mysterious negative pressure or \"Dark Energy.\" For the past 10 years, theorists have invoked numerous mechanisms to help explain this force, including Einstein's cosmological constant, extra dimensions, quintessence, and even hypothesizing the breakdown of General Relativity on cosmological scales.\n\nTo acquire a deeper understanding of dark energy, the Dark Energy Task Force (jointly commissioned by NASA, DOE, and NSF) has recommended that an aggressive program be established to fully characterize dark energy. A part of this process includes support for a new large-area, ground-based optical survey to chart the position and brightness of several hundred million galaxies out to a redshift of order unity. The leading contender that will satisfy these requirements is the Dark Energy Survey (DES).\n\nThe DES is a 5000 square degree photometric survey that will image the South Galactic Cap in multiple filters (griz), using a new 3 sq. deg. CCD camera mounted to the Blanco 4-meter telescope in Chile. The nature of dark energy will be probed utilizing four independent, but complementary techniques: the redshift distribution of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structure, the angular correlation of galaxies as imprinted in the baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernova distances. As a member of the DES, I will explain how these techniques will allow us to unravel the mystery of dark energy.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nThis presentation will discuss a number of physiological, operational, and environmental risk factors (actual and potential) for the occupants of commercial space vehicles. Actual risks include exposure to 1) high acceleration of flight profiles, 2) decreased barometric pressure, 3) microgravity, 4) solar and galactic cosmic radiation, and 4) noise and vibration. Of particular concern are the effects of exposure (short-term and long-term) to microgravity on the cardiovascular, neurological, endocrinological, muscleskeletal, and gastro-intestinal systems, among healthy and diseased passengers.\n\nFurthermore, U.S. and Russian experience regarding space physiology and medicine involve short-term and long-term space flights, but does not address the effects of 1) frequent repetitive exposure (several times a week) to flight profiles involving normal gravity (pre-flight), acceleration (launch/take off), microgravity (space), deceleration (return), and normal gravity (post-flight), 2) frequent repetitive exposure to solar and cosmic radiation, and 3) exposure to microgravity among individuals who have medical pathology. Other potential risk factors include unexpected exposure to temperature extremes, in-flight cabin fire, cabin air contaminates, electricity, non-ionizing radiation, mechanical hazards, impact forces during crash landings, post-crash fire, emergency evacuation, and post-evacuation survival.\n\nSince its inception, NASA has pursued a broad range of international cooperative endeavors with foreign countries. The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 established international cooperation as a fundamental objective of the Agency. To achieve this objective, NASA operates within broad U.S. Government policies, including economic, scientific, and foreign policies, and has established agency guidelines for international cooperation.\n\nPotential benefits of international space cooperation include access to unique capabilities or expertise, increased mission flight opportunities, access to program-critical locations outside of the United States, cost-sharing, and building or reinforcing positive international relations among nations. To date, NASA has concluded thousands of agreements with over 100 nations and international organizations.\n\nIn January 2004, President Bush announced the new Vision for Space Exploration, and NASA was directed to pursue opportunities for international participation in support of the U.S. Government's new goals for human exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. As NASA implements the vision, the agency is promoting new international space cooperation with its foreign space partners in areas of mutual interest, through a variety of bilateral and multilateral mechanisms. At the same time, NASA will continue to develop and implement international cooperative missions, projects, and activities in its longstanding agency program areas of space science, earth science, aeronautics, and space operations.\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nAt the same time that the U.S. and the Soviet Union started their space programs, several countries in South America were also willing to enter the space race to a lesser degree. In the 1960s, Argentina started launching its own sounding rockets. In the 1970s, Brazil did the same. Today, despite the economic setbacks common to the region, several countries in South America have their space projects with advanced high-altitude rockets, several satellites in orbit, and strong research and development programs.\n\nCooperation between the countries of the region and international partners is also very important and reaffirms the peaceful purposes of the space research in South America.\n\nA sample case of the non-governmental educational satellite Pehuensat-1 will be presented."
