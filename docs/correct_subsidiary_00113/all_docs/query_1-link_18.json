        "text": "August 19, 1997\n\nPERSONAL COMPUTING / By STEPHEN MANES\n\nNavigation That Is Hardly Celestial\n\ncertified technogeek friend was so tickled with the navigational device in his rental car on a recent visit that he called me on his cellular phone to make me listen to it say \"Turn left.\" It did get him to my front door, but not before it had sent him several blocks out of his way.\n\nIllustration: Stuart Goldenberg\n\nNo surprise there. Advanced computer technologies are often considered ready to sell to everyday folks once they work reliably most, but not all, of the time. If aviation accepted such standards, you might be unsurprised to hear announcements like: \"Ladies and gentlemen, we will be landing on a freeway adjacent to the airport. Please be patient while we taxi to the gate.\"\n\nBut when business recently took me to Boston, land of streets made from cowpaths and drivers made from pure adrenaline, I decided to try a navigation system available from the Hertz Corporation that costs $6 a day and is available in more than 8,000 cars. It goes by the name Neverlost.\n\nThe unit in my Taurus was a small flat-panel color display on a stalk between the driver's seat and the passenger's. It clearly screamed \"rental car\" to any would-be thief who might peer in, but I was willing to ignore that. At 12:30 A.M., after one flight cancellation, one missing suitcase and one bag of airplane pretzels, I simply wanted the unit to direct my wife and me to Chinatown, where restaurants were still open.\n\nAfter reading a startup message from the legal department warning me not to let the screen distract me while driving, I was unable to find Chinatown anywhere among the listings available on the display. Susan found it on a paper map she had brought along just in case.\n\nSince the Chinatown exit was on the way to our hotel in Waltham, I found that on the list and punched it in. After a minute or so of calculating the route, the system displayed the message \"proceed to route\" and a map with a magenta arrowhead indicating the car. What it did not display was the proper route out of the car rental lot. Nor did it speak so much as a word; that function, advertised as one of the system's greatest strengths, was out of commission. I was too tired to complain.\n\nThe device usually does a pretty fair job of knowing where the car is, but the database manages to offer both too much information and not enough. During a transition from the Massachusetts Turnpike, the display alternately and confusingly referred to routes 128 and 95, which are at that stretch identical. At the tricky Wyman/Winter Street exit, it offered contradictory information by suggesting a right turn onto Totten Pond Road, a byway that, if a roadsign was to be believed, existed only to the left. The right turn the display recommended proved to be correct; the roadsign was not.\n\nAs the hotel loomed to the left, the system urged a U-turn to get there, but that maneuver put me in front of the hotel with no legal way to get into the parking lot. Approaching the correct entrance required going just past the U-turn lane to a left turn lane about which the database was apparently clueless. Had I followed the system's advice, I might have circled endlessly in front of the hotel, orbiting as permanently as the folk song's Charley, the \"man who never returned\" on Boston's MTA.\n\nIf the system includes the Chestnut Hill Mall, I was unable to find it. And although the unit can construct three different routes, there is no way to tell it to avoid known bottlenecks. In an attempt to get from Waltham to Revere Beach, I could not keep it from insisting on a route through the Callahan Tunnel, which I knew would be a traffic nightmare. To go a different way required consulting the paper map, which turned out not to be entirely accurate itself.\n\nThe Pathmaster\n\nMagellan Driver Information Systems, Inc. produces the unit and also makes it available through car dealers for about $3,000 under the name PathMaster. It uses three methods of determining where the car is: fixing on Global Positioning System satellites; using a deadbase stored on a hard drive in the trunk, and dead reckoning by the odometer and an on-board gyroscope.\n\nBut all that technology sometimes gets confused. Returning to Logan Airport from the town of Marblehead, I tried Neverlost again, but at the first five-way intersection the screen suggested what seemed to be a geographical impossibility. As I guessed at what turned out to be the proper turn, the screen flashed the notice \"proceed to route\" and the arrowhead representing the car insisted it was a block east of where it actually was. But there was no way to tell the system, \"Hey, stupid! We're over here!\"\n\n\"Turn it off and on again,\" recommended my wife, who has dealt with computer systems before.\n\nI did. When the system rebooted, rewarned me and recomputed the route, it believed we were even farther east, in a roadless area that it should have known was salt water. The lush trees shading both sides of the street no doubt prevented the system from fixing on enough satellites to get an accurate reading. A third reboot in a more open stretch of road finally fixed the problem.\n\nAt the very end of the journey, the system announced we had arrived at the rental car return area. True enough, but the operative word was \"area.\" We were still a few hundred yards and a right and left turn short of the Hertz lot with only personal inertial guidance to figure out the final turns.\n\nNeverlost? I began to call it Day Tripper, because it brought to mind a line from that Beatles song, \"She took me half the way there.\" Not to mention that James Bond title, \"Never Say Never Again.\"\n\nPERSONAL COMPUTING is published weekly, on Tuesdays.
