        "text": "CARBON PRODUCT LIFETIME WARRANTY\n\nIndustry Nine has gone the extra mile to ensure we offer the best Carbon Wheels available. We are so confident in our wheels that we are now offering a limited lifetime warranty on all carbon wheelsets sold after January 1, 2018.\n\nThe limited lifetime warranty applies to all Industry Nine branded complete carbon wheelsets. Under the limited lifetime warranty, Industry Nine certifies all wheels to be free from defects in materials and workmanship* and applies to the original owner.**\n\nIndustry Nine carbon wheel systems are engineered to be ridden every day and are designed and tested to ensure the strength of the wheels far exceed the loads incurred during their intended use.*** You can rest assured that if you are on an Industry Nine Carbon wheelset, we have you covered.\n\n*The warranty applies to all original owners who purchase their wheels from an Industry Nine Authorized Dealer or directly from Industry Nine; wheels purchased through third-party sites are excluded from the warranty.\n\n**Keep in mind that wheels (as with most moving parts) require periodic maintenance and service. Bearings are considered a wear item and if properly serviced, should last several years, but are not covered under the lifetime warranty. The exception is our Enduro XD-15 Hybrid Ceramic bearings (which are an upgrade option). Any wheel that has been altered, improperly maintained or installed, or modified from its original build will not be eligible for this warranty.\n\n***If you are riding the wheels within the scope of their designated use, we have you covered. If you hit a tree at 30mph or come up short on a double while riding your road bike at the bike park and break a wheel - we have a great crash replacement program.\n\nALLOY PRODUCT WARRANTY\n\nWe offer a two-year warranty against defects in materials or workmanship on all Industry Nine products. Product must be purchased new from authorized dealer, valid for the original owner exclusively. Industry Nine will repair or replace, at our discretion, any affected components or assemblies. The warranty will apply to stems, MatchStix, hub shells, axles, drive mechanisms, spokes, and rims.\n\nIndustry Nine will not be able to provide warranty support or assume liability for hubs or wheels that are utilized outside of their intended purpose. This warranty covers materials and workmanship but does not cover normal wear and tear, such as bearing wear, or damage due to lack of proper service intervals.\n\nSpokes will be warranted against defects, but not trail accidents, drivetrain/frame mechanical failure, or foreign object intrusion.\n\nAluminum rims are covered under the two-year warranty but are not warrantied for impact or crash damage. Use of non-authorized aftermarket adaptors and/or modification of axles, hubs, spokes or any other component may result in a voided warranty. Modification of rim finish or graphics by use of stripping solvents or chemicals will void rim warranty. Use of tire inserts, tire casing type or tire air pressure being ridden does not alter or modify this warranty. Alloy rims can still be susceptible to impact damage when riding inserts, and/or using tires with heavy duty casings, and/or inflated to higher pressures.\n\nWe believe in our product and will try to give Industry Nine customers the benefit of the doubt in any case where the cause of failure is undetermined.\n\nSTEM WARRANTY\n\nIndustry Nine Stems are covered under a two-year limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship. This warranty applies to the original owner and does not cover crash damage, abuse, damage due to improper installation, cosmetic changes due to aging, or use of the product outside of its intended purpose.\n\nPlease keep in mind that bicycle parts are subject to impact damage and material fatigue over time and all bicycle products have a finite service life dependent on the type and frequency of use. We recommend that you have your stem and other cockpit components inspected at least once/year by a qualified mechanic to ensure rider safety.\n\nWarranty claims are administered at the sole discretion of Industry Nine and warranty product must be returned to the Industry Nine dealer where the product was purchased or directly to Industry Nine and require an original receipt.\n\nMATCHSTIX WARRANTY\n\nIndustry Nine Matchstix tools are covered under a two-year limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship. This warranty applies to the original owner and does not cover crash damage, abuse, damage due to improper installation, cosmetic changes due to aging, or use of the product outside of its intended purpose.\n\nWarranty claims are administered at the sole discretion of Industry Nine and warranty product must be returned to the Industry Nine dealer where the product was purchased or directly to Industry Nine and require an original receipt.\n\nRETURN + WARRANTY SHIPPING POLICY\n\nPlease contact your Industry Nine dealer regarding their shop return policy on new, un-installed products returned within 30 days. Industry Nine reserves the right to reject returns on products that have been installed on a bicycle or damaged due to handling.\n\nIf you have a warranty claim you’d like to make, contact us for your RA. The rider is responsible for any labor or shipping charges needed to get the product to our facility. If the warranty claim is accepted, Industry Nine will repair or replace affected product and cover domestic return ground service shipping back to the rider.\n\nIndustry Nine reserves the right to conduct warranty service via our distributor network in the case of International riders.\n\nAll returns must be in new uninstalled condition. Additionally returns on custom wheels are subject to a 10% restocking fee.\n\nIndustry Nine will refund shipping in the case of order or fulfilment errors at the fault of Industry Nine. All other shipping charges are non-refundable or the responsibility of the buyer.\n\nYou can access our complete shipping policy here\n\nInitial Bearing Resistance\n\nIndustry Nine is committed to delivering high-quality bicycle hubs designed for longevity and optimal performance. That's why we select bearings with full contact outboard seals and an 80% grease fill. While these specifications may result in higher initial bearing resistance, they ultimately contribute to maximizing bearing life.\n\nDuring the initial 5-7 hour break-in period, the grease within the bearings lubricates the seals and excess grease is purged through the inboard light contact seal - resulting in a significant reduction in bearing resistance. While riders may experience slightly higher resistance initially, they can expect significantly improved performance and long bearing life once the break-in period is complete.\n\nALUMINUM SPOKES\n\nBy starting with a 25-30% larger cross-sectional area, our machined 7075-T651 aluminum is equal in tensile strength to any 14-gauge or 14/15 DB spoke available. However, functionally the Industry Nine spoke is much stronger, because we have removed all the weak points (known as stress risers) inherent in the design of a traditional hooked steel spoke. First, the spoke has no bend. This is nothing new, but remains an intelligent design. Most steel spokes fail either at the middle of the bend, or the first thread at the nipple end. By eliminating the bend altogether, the spoke is instantly less prone to fatigue stress failure. Second, the root diameter of the Industry Nine one-piece spoke thread is actually larger than the diameter of the length of the spoke. Other spokes fail at the first thread because the root diameter (the bottom of the thread’s “V”) is actually the smallest diameter of the spoke, just where slight relative motions of the nipple apply additional bending forces.\n\nRULES OF ENGAGEMENT\n\n690 Points of engagement! While you let that sink in, here’s a quick history lesson: In 2005 when Industry Nine release its original freehub design we paved a new pathway for hub design. Our dual phase six-pawl drive mechanism generated 120 points of engagement from its 60 tooth drivering and nearly doubled the engagement range of any gear driven hub on the market at the time.\n\nHydra sets a new standard for engagement and durability. By employing a 115 tooth drivering and continuous phasing for the 6 pawls in the hub, Hydra accomplishes an unheard of 690 engagement points. However, the icing on the cake is the inherent durability that comes along with the design. For all existing pawl driven hubs on the market, there is always going to be some chance that you will get a single pawl taking all of the drive load. Due to the inherent flex that exists in all hubs (or bicycle parts in general since no material is completely flex free) occasionally one pawl can drop into the drivering and engage before the additional pawls that are in the same phase are allowed to. This creates a large cantilever load on the FH, axle, and bearings and can lead to FH and bearing wear over time. Hydra, on the other hand, uses this flex to its advantage. As one pawl engages it is always backed up by additional pawls that are phased slightly behind it, so that as torque is applied even the smallest amount of flex allows a 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th tooth to start taking the load. This leaves you with the best possible combination - essentially an instant engagement hub that guarantees torque distribution over multiple points, without the soft feel or wind-up associated with clutch style hubs. As a final feather in its cap, Hydra also addresses two additional areas that are common for high engagement hubs - noise and drag. Due to the smaller drivering teeth and lower spring preload that this system allows, Hydra offers quieter operation and less drag than our Torch FH system. However, it still maintains the buzz that i9 wheels are famous for - but with a quieter more refined sound.\n\nOn the trail Hydra allows scalpel-like precision responding to pedaling inputs faster than imaginable - when it comes to dissecting technical climbs or providing instant acceleration out of every corner.\n\nLISTEN UP!\n\nThe pawl mechanism of our Hydra, Torch Road, and 101 hubs has a distinctive sound. It has the sound of nothing more than the highest-quality sprung pawl system. Most riders report that the noise is inaudible over the wind at higher speeds. It is loud enough to be heard, yet not so loud as to detract from the experience you are trying to enjoy. Our stock FH lubricant is Dumond Tech Pro-X Freehub Grease. For riders who enjoy a louder hub experience, simply wipe down your drive ring, apply Dumond Tech FH oil and you will notice an audible difference.\n\nSERVICEABLE, OF COURSE.\n\nOur near-instant engagement mechanism is not magic but rather built on solid mechanical principles. Having said this, it is assembled in our facility under highly controlled conditions by persons intimately familiar with its operation. Disassembly by the end user is possible and fairly easy with the proper tools. To a skilled and versatile mechanic, it will present no problems, However, if you need additional assistance, please contact us at 828-210-5111 or service@industrynine.com to discuss any issues or set up an RMA #.\n\nANODIZING MATCHED.\n\nWe have a small, purpose-built anodizing lab made specifically to anodize the parts we make for your wheels and hubs. Anodizing is an electrochemical process that has many variables the operator has to react to and adjust daily. While we try to keep our color parameters close, there can be variations from batch to batch, between various alloys and from morning to afternoon. Due to these circumstances, we can not guarantee that your Industry Nine hubs or spokes will match anyone else's paint, anodizing, colors you see on screen.\n\nPlease note - all anodization is subject to fade in direct UV exposure such as sunlight and tanning booths. Please don't tan with your bike - or leave it on your car for extended periods of time on a regular basis if you want your i9's to remain their most brilliant. Certain cleaners may also affect the finish of your anodized parts. Please use warm soapy water to clean your wheels and hubs.\n\n11 SPD ROAD GROUPSET ON MTN\n\nAny of our mountain bike hubs or wheels - 2005 to 2012 \"Legacy\" generation - or 2013 to 2019 Torch generation products as well as our current Hydra drive generation products are compatible with SRAM 1x11 MTB drivetrains using an XD1 FH body or Shimano XTR 11spd using the \"traditional\" HG-style FH body.\n\nThese are mountain bike drivetrains and will not work with Shimano or SRAM 11spd road cassettes. The only exceptions are SRAM 11spd XD type cassettes, which will work with a SRAM 1X11 road group or the Shimano 11-34 HG 800-11 cassette which is designed to work on the narrower mtb. cassette bodies.\n\n20 X 110 BOOST ...OR?\n\nPlease check with your local bike shop, or fork manufacturer to determine if you have a 20 x 110 boost fork or 20 x 110 non boost fork. The fitment guide above can help you determine your current set-up before placing an order. Any further questions? Give us a call at 828-210-5113.\n\nFACILITY TOURS\n\n(TEMPORARILY POSTPONED)\n\nOf course we do! But we have a few requests...\n\nPlease schedule your visit at least 24 hours in advance of your anticipated arrival for one of the times below. This allows us the opportunity to make sure we have appropriate staffing to cover the tour. Our phone number is 828-210-5113.\n\nMondays 9:30AM\n\nFridays 1:30PM\n\nPlease keep groups to five people or less. Special considerations or arrangements can be made for larger groups, but we like to have more notice.\n\nNo minors allowed in the machine shop\n\nClosed toed shoes are required - NO SANDALS or FLIP FLOPS are allowed\n\nEye protection is provided and required while in the shop\n\nEar protection is available upon request\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN\n\nSorry, but we don't offer our System straight pull hubs/spokes by themselves, for mountain or road. We want to ensure all of our wheels built with our proprietary System chassis be built to our exact specifications for QC and warranty qualification and accountability. The only way to ensure the processes are to our standards is to limit assembly to our approved dealers and distributors.\n\nBEARING BETA\n\nIndustry Nine is sourcing an improved bearing from ENDURO. The ENDURO LLU/LLB bearings are equipped with a full contact, dual lip seal on the outboard side and a light contact seal on the inboard side for the best balance of durability and rolling speed. These are properly installed with the light grey seal side toward the outboard side of the component you are installing them into. This provides additional protection towards the side most exposed to the elements.\n\nWe pride ourselves as one of the most compatible wheel and hub manufacturers on the planet. Our systems are deliberately designed with adaptability to various frame, fork and drivetrains - all on the same hubshell. Axle and end cap kits along with freehub bodies are available from our webstore or your local i9 dealer.\n\nHYDRA DRIVE Series Products:\n\nTORCH DRIVE Series Products:\n\n2006-2012 \"Legacy\" Products:\n\nXC Front Hub - QR / 9mm thru / 15mm thru\n\nXC Rear Hub - QR135 / 10x135 / 12x135 / 12x142 - Shimano 9/10/11spd/SRAM 9/10spd and SRAM XD1 11spd\n\nEnduro Front Hub - QR / 9mm thru / 15mm thru / 20mm\n\nEnduro Rear Hub - QR135 / 10x135 / 12x135 / 12x142 - Shimano 9/10/11spd/SRAM 9/10spd and SRAM XD1 11spd\n\nSingle Speed - QR / 10x135 / 12x135 / 12x142\n\nDH150 Rear Hub (looks like Enduro) - 12x150 / 12x157 - Shimano 9/10/11spd/SRAM 9/10spd and SRAM XD1 11spd\n\nClassic Flanged Front Hub - QR / 9mm thru / 15mm thru / 20mm\n\nClassic Flanged Rear Hub - QR135 / 10x135 / 12x135 / 12x142 - Shimano 9/10/11spd/SRAM 9/10spd and SRAM XD1 11spd\n\nClassic Flanged Single Speed - QR / 10x135 / 12x135 / 12x142\n\nClassic Flanged DH150 Rear Hub - 12x150 / 12x157 - Shimano 9/10/11spd/SRAM 9/10spd and SRAM XD1 11spd\n\nIndustry Nine supplies an extraction cap and/or bolt for our Lefty 2.0 hubs, or wheelsets built with Lefty 2.0 hubs.
