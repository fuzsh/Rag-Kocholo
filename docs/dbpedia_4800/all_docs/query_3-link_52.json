        "text": "Memorandum D17-1-10\n\nNote to reader\n\nCanada Border Services Agency is currently reviewing this D-memo. It will be updated in the context of the CBSA Assessment Revenue Management (CARM) initiative and made available to stakeholders as soon as possible. Find out about CARM.\n\nOttawa, November 28, 2012\n\nThis document is also available in PDF (17.3 MB) [help with PDF files]\n\nIn Brief\n\n1. Pending its full revision to ensure compliance with the standard on Web accessibility, this memorandum has been partially updated to introduce the temporary country code XK for imports from Kosovo. [Rev. June 5, 2015]\n\n2. Imports from Kosovo should be coded with the Canadian temporary code \"XK\" in Field No. 12 â Country of Origin and Field No. 13 â Place of Export of the B3, Canada Customs Coding Form. The currency for completing Field No. 17 is \"EUR\" (Euro Dollar). [Rev. June 5, 2015]\n\nThis memorandum describes various forms of accounting documentation and gives instructions for their completion.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGuidelines and General Information\n\nDescription of Forms\n\nForm B3, Canada Customs Coding Form\n\nForm B3B, Canada Customs Cargo Control Continuation Sheet\n\nForm B6D, Ship's Stores Delivery Declaration\n\nInformation Requirements\n\nDocumentation Requirements\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAppendix A - Form B3 Field Sizes\n\nAppendix B - Coding Instructions for Non-warehouse and Non-consolidated Form B3\n\nAppendix C - Form B3 (Bonded Warehouse) Coding Instructions\n\nAppendix D - Form B3B, Canada Customs Cargo Control Continuation Sheet\n\nAppendix E - Metric Conversion\n\nAppendix F - Check Digit Calculation for Transaction Numbers\n\nAppendix G - Detailed Coding Statements\n\nAppendix H - List of Codes\n\nAppendix I - Bar Code Specifications\n\nAppendix J - Form B3, Type F - Coding Instructions for Consolidated Accounting Documents\n\nGuidelines and General Information\n\n1. This memorandum is a guide for Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) personnel, brokers, and importers/owners who are involved in preparing and processing various customs coding forms.\n\n2. Accounting documents must be properly coded before they can be accepted for either manual or automated data processing. The information used to prepare these documents is obtained from invoices, cargo control data, and other sources, and is coded and placed in a designated area on the coding form referred to as a field.\n\nDescription of Forms\n\nForm B3, Canada Customs Coding Form\n\n3.This form is a customs document used to account for imported goods, regardless of value, destined for commercial use in Canada according to sections 6 and 7 of the Accounting for Imported Goods and Payment of Duties Regulations (SOR/86-1062).\n\n4. The CBSA will reprint B3 forms on white paper in blue ink. However, companies may privately print B3 forms in blue or black ink according to Memorandum D17-1-11, Private Printing Policy and Procedures. Importers/brokers must apply coloured wrappers to B3 forms as follows:\n\nType Colour AB and AD (LVS threshold or more)\n\ngreen\n\nAB and AD (less than LVS threshold that quote a remission order number in Field No. 26)\n\ngreen\n\nC, D, H, M, and V (account) (LVS threshold or more) blue C, D, H, M, and V (account) (less than LVS threshold that quote a remission order number in Field No. 26) blue C, D, H, M, and V (cash) (regardless of value)\n\nyellow\n\nC (one-time release prior to payment)\n\nyellow\n\nC, D, H, M, and V (account) (less than LVS threshold)\n\nwhite\n\nF (consolidated account) (less than LVS threshold)\n\nsalmon\n\nAB and AD (less than LVS threshold\n\nwhite (mark AB or AD on wrapper)\n\n10, 20, 21, 22, and 30, including CADEX bonded warehouse\n\ngrey\n\nCADEX non-bonded warehouse\n\ngold\n\n5. Refer to Appendices B, C, and J for instructions and format examples of Form B3, Form B3 (bonded warehouse), and Form B3 (consolidated) respectively.\n\nForm B3B, Canada Customs Cargo Control Continuation Sheet\n\n6. Form B3B is used together with Form B3 when there is more than one cargo control document to be acquitted by one B3 form. A copy of Form B3B can be found in Appendix D.\n\nForm B6D, Ships' Stores Delivery Declaration\n\n7. Form B6D is used together with Form B3, type 22, Ships' Stores, Sales to the Governor General and Diplomats. It has the declaration of the vessel's master or agent, or the airline company's agent, certifying that the goods are for use as ships' stores. It also has the border service officer's certificate that the goods were accompanied on board and sealed on the vessel or aircraft. You can find more information on ships' stores in Memorandum D4-2-1, Ships' Stores Regulations.\n\nInformation Requirements\n\n8. It is in the best interest of brokers, importers/owners, and CBSA personnel to present accurate documents to CBSA. This allows CBSA to carry out its processing and enforcement functions and expedites release of the shipment to the importer/owner or broker.\n\n9. All information on the coding forms must be legible and all fields must be completed according to the instructions in the appendices.\n\n10. The B3 form package must also include all certificates, licences, permits, or other documents that may be required by another government department or agency as they apply to their acts or regulations for imported goods. However, consolidated Form B3 accounting documents (Form B3, type F) used to account for goods released under the Courier/Low Value Shipment (LVS) Program are not to include supporting documentation when the accounting document is presented to customs. Any supporting documentation (i.e., invoices, Orders in Council) are to be held at the importer's and broker's premises to allow an officer in the future to perform an audit of the records and to obtain or verify the information on which the calculation of duties was based.\n\n11. The border services officer will review Form B3 documentation to ensure compliance with the CBSA's requirements. They will return any B3 form that does not meet the requirements to the importer/owner or broker, and where applicable, withhold release of goods. In all such cases, the border services officer will inform the importer/owner or broker of the reasons for rejection.\n\nDocumentation Requirements\n\n12. When Form B3 is presented at a terminal office and is paid either by cash or account, only one copy is required: the CBSA copy. The official receipt for monies tendered for payment of Form B3 at automated locations is a stamped duty-paid copy of a Detailed Coding Statement (DCS) for cash entries or a Form K84, Importer/Broker Account Statement, for account entries. Both these statements are generated by the customs automated system. For details, refer to Memorandum D17-1-5, Registration, Accounting and Payment for Commercial Goods.\n\n13. When requesting release prior to payment under a Release on Minimum Documentation (RMD) (excluding CADEX), two copies of the release documentation must be presented. The original will be retained by the CBSA for control purposes when the shipment is released and the duplicate returned to the importer/owner or broker for use with the confirming Form B3. In the case of a one-time release prior to payment, three copies of the release documentation are required. The third copy will be attached to the request from the importer/owner or broker to transact bonded operations. For more details, refer to MemorandumD1-7-1, Posting Security for Transacting Bonded Operations, and Memorandum D17-1-5.\n\n14. Under the Courier LVS Program, approved participants can consolidate a number of shipments on Form B3, type F. This consolidation may include a number of LVS, which were released from the CBSA. Goods that are prohibited, controlled, or regulated by an Act of Parliament or a regulation made under such an Act are excluded from this program. However, the program accepts goods for which a special authority (i.e., Order in Council) applies. Goods valued at greater than the Courier LVS threshold are also excluded from this program. Consolidation of this B3 form may be made by a CBSA office, a regional consolidation, a consolidation by carrier, a consolidation by importer, or a national consolidation. For more information regarding the Courier LVS Program, refer to Memorandum D17-4-0, Courier Low Value Shipment Program.\n\n15. Because Form B3 (bonded warehouse) is a multi-use form, the number of copies required will depend on the type. The following chart outlines this information when Form B3 is presented at a terminal office.\n\nForm B3 Type and Wrapper Colour Copies Required Remarks 10 (grey) Form B3 for Warehouse 3 1 to CBSA 1 to warehouse control 1 to warehouse operator 13 (grey) Form B3 for Re-warehouse 3 1 to CBSA 20 (grey) Ex warehouse Form B3 for Consumption 1 to warehouse control 21 (grey) Form B3 Ex warehouse for Export 1 to warehouse operator 30 (grey) Transfer of Goods 22 (grey) Form B3 Ships' Stores, Sales to the Governor General and Diplomats 5 1 to CBSA 1 to warehouse control 1 to warehouse operator 2 to the vessel\n\n16. At non-terminal offices, an importer's/broker's copy of the documentation is required for return with a daily notice of transactions finalized that day. The CBSA copy will be date-stamped with the date of final accounting and forwarded to the appropriate automated office.\n\nAdditional Information\n\n17. Any questions regarding Form B3 coding instructions or format examples in this memorandum should be directed to the nearest CBSA office.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nFORM B3 FIELD SIZES\n\nThe following indicates the maximum field size for each field on FormB3 where:\n\nT = Alpha/Numeric\n\nA = Alpha\n\nN = Numeric\n\n(...X) = up to X characters, e.g., (...3) up to 3characters\n\n(x) = x mandatory characters, e.g., (3) 3 mandatory characters\n\nxr = x characters to the right of the decimal point.

If Form B3 has two or more pages, complete on the first page. (For Form B3, type F requirements, see Appendix J.)\n\nShow the importer's address if it does not appear on the supporting invoice.\n\nIn the \"No.\" section of this field, show the customs business account number. This number is a standard way of identifying importing and exporting businesses, and is used in the processing of customs accounting documents. If you have one or more customs accounts, indicate the six-digit account identifier (e.g., RM0001).\n\nField No. 2 - Transaction Number\n\nMust complete on all types of Form B3 when release prior to payment security is being used.\n\nThis number is 14 digits in length and contains the following:\n\n(a) the first five digits represent the account security number of the importer/broker who will present the accounting document and/or pay the duties and taxes; and\n\n(b) the next eight digits represent a number assigned by the importer/broker; and\n\n(c) the last digit is a check digit calculated using a formula provided by the CBSA (refer to Appendix F).\n\nShow the transaction number assigned at time of release, if applicable, on all copies of Form B3 and on the first page of the supporting documents. It must be in bar-coded format (see the following note on bar coding) on the first page of the CBSA copy of Form B3. Refer to Appendix I for bar code specifications. The typed or clearly annotated transaction number must appear on all the remaining pages of Form B3 and on the first page of the supporting documents. If the supporting document is multi-paged, the total number of attachments must also be shown on the first page. This eliminates the need to include the transaction number on each page of the supporting documents.\n\nThe transaction number must also be typed or clearly annotated on all applicable permits, certificates, and licences.\n\nThe transaction number must not be duplicated for 7 years and 3 months (6-year period plus 15 current months). Note that if a transaction is adjusted, the 7 year period plus 3 months will begin at the date of final decision.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. All importers/brokers who have an account security number with release prior to payment privileges must submit FormB3 documentation with a bar-coded transaction number.\n\n2. Importers/brokers having only \"uncertified cheque\" security must assign a transaction number to their accounting documentation. However, it is not mandatory that the transaction number be bar-coded. For all unsecured transactions (i.e.,\"cash\" transactions), the CBSA will assign a bar-coded transaction number.\n\nThe transaction number field on unsecured Form B3s and Form B3s type M, must be left blank because Form B3 will be numbered by customs upon presentation. Transaction numbers applied by importers and brokers will not be valid for mail shipments.

These examples depict typical, not actual transactions.\n\nNote: The rates of duty, GST, and excise taxes, as well as the rates of exchange used for calculation and testing purposes on the examples are not necessarily currently in effect. Therefore, while the actual coding on the examples is correct, information such as tariff rates and tax rates should be verified by checking the Customs Tariff, the Excise Tax Act, and other reference sources to ensure accuracy. Bar codes shown on Form B3 examples are for illustration purposes only.\n\nThe examples have been set forth in the following order:\n\nExample No. Type Format Simple Form B3 Type Formats 1 AB - Confirming Form B3 2 C - Perfect Form B3 3 D - Sight Form B3 4 AD - Confirming Sight Form B3 5 V - Voluntary (bona fide) 6 V - Voluntary (investigation) 7 H - Supplementary B3 Form Complex B3 Form Formats 8 Multiple Sub-headers (diplomatic goods) 9 Chapter 99 special classification provisions 10 Packaged manufactured tobacco with package exceeding 200 grams 11 Packaged manufactured tobacco 12 Additional duty on cigar ($0.067 per cigar) 13 Additional duty on cigar (duty-paid value) 14 Cigarettes containing tobacco 1361 g per thousand 15 Excise taxes and special levies 16 SIMA assessment (payment) 17 SIMA assessment (deferred by bond) 18 Canadian goods repaired abroad without warranty in a country other than the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica 19 Importation of goods repaired free under warranty in a Country other than the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica 20 Importation of goods repaired without warranty in the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica 21 Importation of goods repaired free under warranty in the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica 22 Partial remission (flat rate per month) 23\n\nRepayment of drawback, refund or remission\n\n24\n\nDuty deferral program\n\n25\n\nImported Spirits for Blending Remission Order\n\n26\n\nPartial remission of GST (1/60)\n\n27 Packing (duty and goods and services tax) 28\n\nCanadian goods returned\n\n29 Proportional duty (1/120) - Vessels 30\n\nComputer Carrier Media Remission Order - Dutiable import\n\n31\n\nForms B3 and E29B, for temporary importations\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\nType AB - Confirming Form B3\n\nThis example shows the format to be used to complete a simple Form B3, type AB when accounting for goods released on minimum documentation.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\nType C - Perfect Form B3\n\nThis example shows the format to be used to complete a simple Form B3, type C.\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\nType D - Sight Form B3\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when an importer/owner prepares a sight Form B3 because fully satisfactory documentation cannot be submitted. The sight deposit amount must be shown in Field No. 43 and added into total duty (Field No. 47). The reason for the sight document is shown in Field No. 22 on the line following the last line accounting for the goods. The time limit must be shown in Field No. 18.\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\nType AD - Confirming sight Form B3\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when accounting for goods released on minimum documentation where a sight deposit applies. The sight deposit amount must be shown in Field No. 43 and added into the total duty (Field No. 47). The reason for the sight document is shown in Field No. 22 on the line following the last line accounting for the goods. The time limit must be shown in Field No. 18.\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\nType V - Voluntary (bona fide)\n\nThis example shows the format to be used by an importer/owner who has come forward and voluntarily declared goods that were delivered to him without the benefit of CBSA clearance. The importer/owner has also produced invoices for this shipment, and therefore, all the fields on Form B3 can be correctly completed. A brief statement of the circumstances is shown in the body of Form B3.\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\nType V - Voluntary (investigation)\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when a voluntary or assessment Form B3 is prepared as a result of a CBSA file or ruling: in this case, an Investigation Division file. Those fields for which the required information is not available or is not applicable must be left blank (e.g., Field No. 45, \"Cargo Control Number\"). The file relating to Form B3 is shown in the description field and a brief statement of the circumstances is shown in the body of Form B3.\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\nType H - Supplementary Form B3\n\nThis example shows the format to be used to voluntarily account for goods previously reported but not accounted for at the time of final accounting: for example, to account for a line on an invoice that was inadvertently omitted on a previous Form B3. Field No. 24, \"Previous Transaction Number\" is to indicate the transaction number of the previous Form B3. No cargo control number is required in Field No. 45, \"Cargo Control Number.\" The release date must be shown in the body of Form B3.\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\nMultiple sub-headers (diplomatic goods)\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when a change occurs to the content of the sub-header (e.g., vendor name). All fields within the sub-header must be completed on each new page as well as the appropriate fields on the related classification line. Sub-header fields should never be completed on new pages if a new sub-header is not applicable. Note that in any situation where multiple pages apply, trailer information in Field Nos. 43 to 51 should only be completed on the final Form B3 page.\n\nEXAMPLE 8 - cont\n\nThe certificate referred to in Field No. 22 is one attested to by a signing officer of the embassy or consulate, declaring the goods to be for official use and not for sale.\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\nChapter 99 - Special classification provisions\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when a special classification provision of Chapter 99 of the Customs Tariff is applicable. In Field No. 27 indicate the classification number for the goods from Chapters 1 97 of the Schedule to the Customs Tariff. Indicate only the first four digits of the Chapter 99 tariff item in Field No. 28 (i.e., tariff item 9967.00.00 is indicated as 9967). In this case the normal rate of duty equal to 6% is lowered to a free rate by the Chapter 99 tariff item. GST is still payable unless the goods qualify for the use of a GST status code.\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\nPackaged manufactured tobacco with package exceeding 200 grams\n\nFor tobacco of Heading 24.03 imported in packages greater than 200 grams, the importer is required to manually calculate the excise duty rate and the amount. Therefore, if an importer brings in 20 packages weighing 454 grams each, the quantity of 20 would be entered in field 29; while the 44.00 would be coded into field 34. The importer must then calculate the total excise duties owed and enter that amount into field 40. The excise duty per package is calculated by multiplying $2.8925 (the rate for each 50 gram increment or fraction of 50 grams contained in a package) by the number of units of 50 grams, including fractions of 50 gram, in each package. In this case there are 10 units of 50 grams in each package. Thus the excise duty amount per package would be $28.925 ($2.8925 times 10) and the excise duty payable on the total shipment of 20 packages would be $578.50 ($28.925 times 20).\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\nPackaged manufactured tobacco\n\nAs of July 30, 2008, only one rate of excise duty is to be applied on each entry line. Although this legislative change concerns an adjustment to the excise duty for \"packaged\" manufactured tobacco of Heading 24.03, for systems validation purposes the excise tax rate field 34 will be used to validate the excise duty amount owing. Therefore, for \"packaged\" manufactured tobacco of this Heading, the excise tax rate field must be completed with the applicable excise duty rates that apply to E codes E37-41 as follow:\n\nEXAMPLE 12\n\nAdditional duty on cigar ($0.067 per cigar)\n\nAs of January 1, 2008 the excise duty rate on cigars is $18.50 per 1000 cigars (Section 4 of Schedule 1 to the Excise Act, 2001); and the additional duty rate is the greater of $0.067 per cigar or the 67% of the duty-paid value with the later meaning, in respect of imported cigars, the value of the cigars as it would be determined for the purpose of calculating an ad valorem duty on the cigars in accordance with the Customs Act, whether or not the cigars are subject to ad valorem duty, plus the amount of any duty imposed on the cigars under section 42 of the Excise Act, 2001 and section 20 of the Customs Tariff. In this example the rate of $0.067 per cigar is greater than the rate of 67% of the duty-paid value.\n\nEXAMPLE 13\n\nAdditional duty on cigar (duty-paid value)\n\nIn this example, the additional excise duty on cigars applies and is calculated at the rate of 67% of the duty-paid value (see previous example for the definition of duty-paid value)\n\nEXAMPLE 14\n\nCigarettes containing tobacco 1361 g per thousand\n\nThe excise duty rate is $0.425 for each five cigarettes of fraction of five cigarettes contained in any package as per section 1(b) of Schedule 1 to the Excise Act, 2001. For standard package sizes (i.e. packages of 20 or 25 cigarettes), this amounts to $85.00 per 1000 cigarettes.\n\nIf a cigarette exceeds 102mm in length, each portion of 76 mm or less is considered to be a separate cigarette (Section 2 of the Excise Act, 2001); therefore, the quantity reported should reflect the each portion of 76 mm or less.\n\nFor classification line 1, nine cigarettes not exceeding 102mm in length are being imported. Therefore, a quantity of nine is reported and the rate of $85.00 per 1000 applies.\n\nFor classification line 2, nine cigarettes exceeding 102mm in length (i.e. 110 mm) are being imported. In this case, each cigarette contains 2 portions of 76mm or less. Therefore, the quantity is multiplied by 2 as shown in the example on classification line 2, for the calculation of the excise duty.\n\nEXAMPLE 15\n\nExcise taxes and special levies\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when accounting for automobiles with various excise tax rates. When different excise tax rates apply, a new classification line must be completed for each line. In this example the special levy does not apply on line 1, only the $100 for the air conditioner. A listing of vehicles, associated fuel-efficiency ratings and the formula for the calculation of the weighted fuel consumption (in a case where a specific brand is not listed) can be found either at the CRA or NRCan Web site at http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/et/etsl64/README.html or http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/tools/fuelratings/fuel-consumption.cfm; automobiles that have a weighted average fuel consumption rating of 13 or more litres per 100 kilometres will be subject to the excise tax at the following rates:\n\nat least 13 but less than 14 litres per 100 kilometres, $1000;\n\nat least 14 but less than 15 litres per 100 kilometres, $2000;\n\nat least 15 but less than 16 litres per 100 kilometres, $3000; and\n\n16 or more litres per 100 kilometres, $4000.\n\nEXAMPLE 16\n\nSIMA assessment (payment)\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when the goods are subject to SIMA assessment, and payment of SIMA duty is made. The SIMA code in Field No. 32 shows 31; the first digit indicates that provisional duty is being assessed and the second digit indicates that the amount is being paid in cash. The export price has been determined to be the selling price on the invoice and is 5Â¢ each or $50 for the shipment. The normal value has been determined to be 10Â¢ each or $100 for the shipment. The provisional anti dumping duty is the amount by which the export price is lower than the normal value, in this case 5Â¢ per unit times the number of units released during the provisional period (1000 × 5Â¢ = $50). Value for tax in Field No. 41 must include the SIMA assessment amount completed in Field No. 39. Total SIMA assessment must be included in Field No. 48.\n\nEXAMPLE 17\n\nSIMA assessment (deferred by bond)\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when the goods are subject to SIMA assessment, and a bond has been posted for deferral of payment of the SIMA assessment. The SIMA code in Field No. 32 shows 32; the first digit indicates that provisional duty is being assessed and the second digit indicates the payment is deferred by a SIMA bond (See Memorandum D14 1 5 for details respecting use of the SIMA bond). Provisional anti dumping duty is the difference between normal value and export price (see previous example for details). Value for tax in Field No. 41 does not include the SIMA assessment amount which is shown in Field No. 39. The total SIMA assessment amount in Field No. 48 is nil.\n\nNote that the bond number is shown in Field No. 22.\n\nEXAMPLE 18\n\nCanadian goods repaired abroad without warranty in a country other than the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when Canadian goods are returned after being repaired without warranty in a country other than the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica. The first classification line shows the value of the goods at the time of import less the value of the repairs. Duty and GST are relieved under the Canadian Goods Abroad Program. Indicate 98-01-0101 in Field No. 26, \"Special Authority.\" The second classification line shows the value of the repairs. Duty and taxes must be calculated for this line in the normal manner. Total value for duty in Field No. 9 includes the value of the goods at the time of export as well as the value of the repairs.\n\nEXAMPLE 19\n\nImportation of goods repaired free under warranty in a country other than the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when goods are returned after being repaired under warranty in a country other than the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica.\n\n(a) The first classification line is the good's Canadian value at time of export meaning the import value less the value of the repairs, additions, or work abroad. Duties including GST are relieved on this amount; and\n\n(b) The second classification line, with the same classification number, is the value of the repairs, equipment additions, or work done abroad. Duties including GST are payable on this amount. However, in this example, the goods are repaired under warranty and are not subject to GST. Indicate GST status code 66 in Field No. 35.\n\nTotal value for duty in Field No. 9 includes the value of the goods at the time of export, as well as the value of the repairs. The value for duty code in Field No. 31 will be \"19\" or \"29,\" as appropriate, for the residual method of valuation.\n\nEXAMPLE 20\n\nImportation of goods repaired without warranty in the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when Canadian goods are returned after being repaired in the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica where the goods are not under warranty. Indicate the classification number of the goods in Chapters 1 97 of the Customs Tariff in Field No. 27. Indicate \"9992\" in Field No. 28. The goods and repairs are duty free because they qualify under a Chapter 99 special classification provision (tariff item 9992.00.00), but the goods are subject to GST on the value of the repair that appears in Field 37 of the classification line. The value for duty code in Field No. 31 will be \"19\" or \"29,\" as appropriate, for the residual method of valuation.\n\nEXAMPLE 21\n\nImportation of goods repaired free under warranty in the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when Canadian goods are returned after being repaired free under warranty in the United States, Mexico, Chile, Israel or another CIFTA beneficiary, or Costa Rica. The goods and the repairs are duty free because they qualify under a Chapter 99 special classification provision (tariff item 9992.00.00) and are not subject to GST because they qualify under GST status code 66. Indicate the classification number of the goods in Chapters 1 97 of the Customs Tariff in Field No. 27. Indicate \"9992\" in Field No. 28. The value for duty code in Field No. 31 will be \"19\" or \"29,\" as appropriate, for the residual method of valuation.\n\nEXAMPLE 22\n\nPartial remission (flat rate per month)\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when an importer/owner is entitled to partial remission of GST based on a flat rate per month as specified in the remission order. The duty and taxes payable are not related to the value for duty or to the rate of duty payable under the particular classification number. Indicate \"9993\" in Field No. 28.\n\nEXAMPLE 23\n\nRepayment of drawback, refund, or remission\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when documenting the importation of goods once exported from Canada and are re imported (heading No. 9813, 9814, or 9992) and on which the customs duties, refunds or drawbacks allowed at the time of exportation, must be repaid. In Field No. 26, insert special authority number 50 0000. In Field No. 38, \"Customs Duties\" or Field No. 42, \"GST,\" insert the amount being repaid. The statement shown on the body of the example is required.\n\nEXAMPLE 24\n\nDuty Deferral Program\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when goods are imported under the Duty Deferral Program. In this case, 60% of the imported goods are subject to remission of customs duty only. The remaining 40% of the goods have to be shown on the first classification line on which regular customs duty and GST must be paid. The second line accounts for 60% of the goods which are entitled to remission of 100% of the customs duty. The GST is not remitted under this program. Depending on the authorization granted to the importer of the goods, the amount of relief may vary. The relief amount will be indicated on the authorization. For further information, refer to Memorandum D7 4 1, Duties Relief Program.\n\nEXAMPLE 25\n\nImported Spirits for Blending Remission Order\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when remitting partial duty under the Imported Spirits for Blending Remission Order. This Order remits customs duty payable equivalent to excise duty on spirits, wine, or flavouring materials having a spirit content, imported into Canada for the purpose of being blended in a distillery with spirits in bond. Indicate the OIC number \"83-2525\" in Field No. 26. For more information, see Memorandum D8-2-18, Imported Spirits for Blending Remission Order.\n\nEXAMPLE 26\n\nPartial remission of GST (1/60)\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when goods are duty free, but are subject to relief of GST on a proportional (1/60) basis only. Note that only one classification line is required. The value for currency conversion must be completed in Field No. 36. If the goods are subject to GST, it is calculated on the value for tax divided by 60 multiplied by the time limit (in this example, $150,000 ÷ 60 × 3(months) × 5% = $375.00). For more information, refer to Memorandum D8 1 1, Temporary Importation (Tariff Item No. 9993.00.00) Regulations.\n\nEXAMPLE 27\n\nPacking (duty and goods and services tax)\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when duty and GST are collected for packing on a separate classification line. Note that the line accounting for packing follows the line accounting for the goods to which it relates.\n\nEXAMPLE 28\n\nCanadian goods returned\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when Canadian goods are re imported into Canada. The shipper should be shown in Field No. 11 for vendor. Field No. 16, \"Direct Shipment Date,\" is not required. Field No. 17, \"Currency Code,\" must show the code for Canadian currency. The value for duty code in Field 31 will be \"19\" or \"29,\" as appropriate, for the residual method of valuation.\n\nNote: GST may apply to goods classified under tariff No. 9813.00.00. Use code 66 only if no GST is payable. Refer to example 21 for more information.\n\nEXAMPLE 29\n\nProportional duty (1/120) - Vessels\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when goods are subject to a remission on a proportional 1/120 basis. Order in Council 88 0357 must be quoted in Field No. 26, \"Special Authority.\" The Headquarters' authorization number (e.g., CCV 88/999) must be quoted in Field No. 22, \"Description.\" Form B3 must be accompanied by a copy of the Headquarters' authorization. The entire amount may be accounted for on Form B3, but if payments are made on a monthly basis, they should be accounted for on Form B2 with reference to the original Form B3.\n\nEXAMPLE 30\n\nComputer Carrier Media Remission Order - Dutiable import\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when dutiable software is imported. The value of the carrier medium and the reproduction service is accounted for on line 1. The value of the data or instructions contained on the carrier medium is accounted for on line 2. The Computer Carrier Media Remission Order relieves the duty but GST applies. See Memorandum D8-3-15, Computer Carrier Media Remission Order, for further information.\n\nEXAMPLE 31\n\nForms B3 and E29B, for temporary importations\n\nThis example shows the format to be used when goods are temporarily imported and are subject to full relief of duty but only partial (1/60) relief of GST. GST is calculated on 1/60th of the value for duty multiplied by the number of months the goods will remain in Canada (i.e., $1000 ÷ 60 × 3(months) = $50). They must be documented on Forms E29B and B3 and the forms are cross referenced.\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nFORM B3 (BONDED WAREHOUSE) CODING INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe fields of Form B3 (bonded warehouse) must be completed according to the following instructions.\n\nField No.1 - Importer Name and Address\n\nMust complete importer's name on all Form B3 types. If Form B3 has two or more pages, complete on the first page. (For Form B3, type F requirements, see Appendix J)\n\nShow the importer's address if it does not appear on the supporting invoice.\n\nIn the \"No.\" section of this field, show the Business Number and the CBSA account number. This number is a standard way of identifying importing and exporting businesses, and is used in the processing of CBSA accounting documents. If you have one or more CBSA accounts, indicate the six-digit account identifier (e.g., RM0001).\n\nField No.2 - Transaction Number\n\nMust complete on all types of Form B3 when release prior to payment security is being used.\n\nThis number is 14 digits in length and includes the following:\n\n(a) the first five digits represent the account security number of the importer/broker who will present the accounting document and/or pay the duties and taxes; and\n\n(b) the next eight digits represent a number assigned by the importer/broker; and\n\n(c) the last digit is a check digit calculated using a formula provided by customs (refer to Appendix F).\n\nShow the transaction number assigned at time of release, if it applies, on all copies of Form B3 and on the first page of the supporting documents. It must be in bar-coded format (see the following note on bar coding) on the first page of the CBSA copy of Form B3. Refer to Appendix I for bar code specification. The typed or clearly written transaction number must appear on all the remaining pages of Form B3 and on the first page of the supporting documents. If the supporting document is multi-paged, the total number of attachments must also be shown on the first page. This eliminates the need to include the transaction number on each page of the supporting documents.\n\nThe transaction number must also be typed or clearly written on all applicable permits, certificates, and licences.\n\nThe transaction number must not be duplicated for 7 years and 3 months (a 6-year period plus 15 current months). Note that if a transaction is adjusted, the 7-year period plus 3 months will begin at the date of final decision.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. All importers/brokers who have an account security number with release prior to payment privileges must submit Form B3 documentation with a bar-coded transaction number.\n\n2. Importers/brokers having only \"uncertified cheque\" security must assign a transaction number to their accounting documentation. However, it is not mandatory that the transaction number be bar-coded. For all unsecured transactions (i.e., \"cash\" transactions), customs will assign a bar-coded transaction number.\n\nField No.3 - Type\n\nMust complete on all Form B3 types. If Form B3 has two or more pages, Form B3 type is to be shown on the first page.\n\nCode Form B3 types numerically as follows:\n\n10 - Form B3 for all goods in warehouse - used when goods are to be entered into a CBSA customs bonded warehouse.\n\n13 - Form B3 for re-warehouse - used when goods are re-warehoused after being transferred (except to a duty-free shop) or removed on type 30, e.g., after removal from another bonded warehouse either at the same CBSA office or at a different CBSA office.
