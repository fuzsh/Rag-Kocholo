        "text": "— Here we are all crazy. I'm crazy. You're crazy - said the Cat\n\n—How do you know I'm crazy? - Alice asked.\n\n—You have to be, or you wouldn't have come here.\n\nI never dreamed of finding myself writing this… When I was little I loved to sit in the living room and watch movies with my mother, they were always the same: Disney, Barbie or Tim Burton. And, yes, the difference is huge, but nothing made me happier than seeing Jack Skeleton kidnap Santa Claus, who I had never liked; see Edward Scissorhands and listen to Dianne Wiest's “Avon llama” or want to eat all the chocolate in the world after finishing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nMy meeting with Tim Burton\n\nI came to a room full of young talent. New generations of artists gathered to see a single person. Someone who probably marked our childhood and who, between animation, darkness, love and music, gave art to an entire generation.\n\nThe meeting began around 12:00 on October 28, on stage, Álex de la Iglesia, whom I wanted to meet after seeing Venicephrenia, was there to guide the conversation: “We are going to receive one of the most important directors of this century”.\n\nMy excitement wanted to make me jump on stage, but as a sensible person that I am sometimes, I decided to stay seated next to my colleagues, clearly they were as excited as I was. And, suddenly, it happened: a man dressed in black, with combed and disheveled hair at the same time, greets and sits in that brown chair. At that moment, I could feel the greatness of what that meant for all of us.\n\nThe director Corpse Bride He gave us a smile and gave us the unique opportunity to enjoy his stories, adventures and jokes.\n\n“Tim Burton doesn't just make movies, he creates places and universes that we can visit again and again. His films make us see the world in a different way ” Álex de la Iglesia\n\nas alumni TAI of the Master of Film Direction I can't even begin to thank you for what this meeting meant to me. I had the privilege of listening to Burton give such interesting facts about his life and work that they made us move and laugh: \"I feel that, many times, the characters of each creator reflect a little bit of themselves, so I guess the reality is that I'm a little crazy\". And I couldn't agree more, because it's clear to me that when I write the story of a character I leave something of myself in them, and they always leave something new in me.\n\nAn important experience on my way\n\nAlmost at the end of that conversation between the two directors, we were given the opportunity to ask questions, which logically fell short for us, but many were able to express their emotions and questions. During that time we talked about illustration, stop motion, color ethics, characters... but, above all, we were able to explain how important that moment was for our lives.\n\nAt the end of the questions, Burton left the room leaving an immeasurable emotion to be able to listen to him and the sadness that it was over. Although, really, the experience had not finished yet, because we had the opportunity to visit the exhibition for the first time.\n\nTim Burton, the Labyrinth is a immersive exhibition The one where you never know what you might find, and is made up of illustrations and unrevealed creations by the artist. Upon entering, the staff asks you how you want to live the experience: alone, as a couple or in a group of up to eight people. Once my group and I decided, they took us to a room where the experience began: a red button chooses the first door to go through that takes you on a magical journey in which decisions will mark the path to travel.\n\nI cannot express in words what I experienced there, I only know that it was worth it. I discovered new stories, characters and I would even say colors. I was able to bring back that girl who was enjoying herself with her mother on the sofa and, the truth is, I was delighted to see her again.\n\nChronicle by Alba de Rueda\n\nInstagram @albaderuedavazquez\n\n(Alumni Master in Film and TV Series Direction)"
