We must take into account the periods during which it is necessary to retain personal data to fulfill our legal obligations.\n\nFor what purpose do we process personal data?\n\nIn order to keep users informed of promotions, launches and news pertaining to MAJORICA products. For these purposes, the data may be managed through a mass delivery system that automates communications via e-mail or mobile phone messages (SMS). In order to manage, develop and execute the purchase of our products, as well as to process special services and returns. If the purpose of the personal data processing changes, all those affected will be informed of the new purpose and reminded once again of the rights they can exercise. Personal data will be stored as long as the owner does not request its deletion.\n\nWhat legitimizes the processing of personal data?\n\nThe processing of your data is based on the consent given when filling in the subscription form, during the purchase of a Majorica product, or during a return/claim. You can withdraw consent at any time, without prejudice to the data processing carried out between the giving of consent and its withdrawal.\n\nWho is the recipient of your data?\n\nYour data will not be communicated or transferred to third parties, with only MAJORICA having access to it. We never pass on, sell or exchange your personal data with third parties.\n\nWhat rights do you have when you provide us with your data?\n\nYou can exercise the following rights in relation to the processing of your data:\n\n1 - Right of access\n\nYou will have the right to obtain information from MAJORICA on whether we are processing your personal data, as well as on the following: the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; the existence of associated rights; the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; the existence of automated decision-making.\n\nIf we are processing your personal data, you will be provided with a copy of it if you so request it. If you request this information by electronic means, you will be given the copy in a commonly used electronic format.\n\n2 - Right to rectification\n\nYou can request at any time the rectification of your personal data if it is not accurate. Likewise, you can request that the personal data owned by MAJORICA be completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.For these purposes, you must specify in your request what data and to what extent you want it to be rectified or completed.\n\n3 - Right to erasure\n\nYou can exercise the right to erasure, also known as the right to be forgotten, which implies the deletion of all the data that MAJORICA has concerning you, where one of the following grounds applies:\n\na. The personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;\n\nb. You withdraw consent and there is no other legal ground for the processing;\n\nc. You object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing;\n\nd. Your data has been unlawfully processed.\n\nWhen the erasure derives from the exercise of the right to opposition for direct marketing purposes, MAJORICA may retain your identification data in order to prevent future processing for direct marketing purposes.\n\nWhen MAJORICA has made the personal data public and is obliged to erase said data, MAJORICA, taking into account the available technology and the cost of implementation, will take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that you have requested the erasure of any links to, or copy or replication of, that personal data.\n\nThe right to erasure will not apply to the extent that the processing is necessary:\n\na. For exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;\n\nb. For compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n\nc. For reasons of public interest;\n\nd. For scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, insofar as the right to erasure is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing;\n\ne. For the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\n4 - Right to restriction of processing\n\nYou will have the right to obtain from MAJORICA restriction of processing of your personal data where one of the following applies:\n\na. The accuracy of the personal data is contested by you, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;\n\nb. If you consider the processing being carried out by MAJORICA of your personal data to be unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and request the restriction of its use instead;\n\nc. When MAJORICA no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;\n\nd. When you have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of MAJORICA override yours.\n\nOnce you have obtained the restriction of processing in accordance with this section, you will be informed by MAJORICA before the restriction of processing is lifted. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph (a), your personal data will, with the exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.\n\n5 - Right to object\n\nYou have the right to object at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing of personal data concerning you, unless it is based on the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in MAJORICA or when necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by MAJORICA. If you exercise this right, MAJORICA will stop processing your personal data, unless we believe and can demonstrate there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. When the processing of personal data is for direct marketing purposes (a form of advertising that uses one or more means to communicate directly with a target audience and obtain a measurable response from it), you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you.\n\n6 - Right to data portability\n\nYou will have the right to receive the personal data that concerns you, which you have provided to MAJORICA, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit it to another controller without hindrance from MAJORICA, when the processing is based on consent and is carried out by automated means.

This right to portability will not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in MAJORICA.\n\n7 - Withdrawal of consent\n\nYou have the right to withdraw consent at any time, without effect on the legality of the processing based on the consent given prior to its withdrawal.\n\n8 - Complaints\n\nWe inform you that you can submit a complaint to the competent Data Protection Supervisory Authority, especially when you have not obtained satisfaction in the exercise of your rights\n\nHow can you exercise your rights?\n\nYou can exercise the rights that are listed and explained in the previous section by sending the appropriate request. You can always contact us at: [email protected]\n\nWhat rights do you have in relation to automated individual decision-making?\n\nIn relation to automated individual decision-making, including profiling, you will have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling. This will not apply if the decision is necessary for entering into a contract with MAJORICA, is authorized by law which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or if it is based on your explicit consent.\n\nIn the cases where it is necessary for entering into or performance of a contract and/or is based on consent, MAJORICA will implement suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of MAJORICA, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.\n\nUpdates to our Privacy Notice:\n\nWe may at any time have to update our Privacy Notice.

The price of the product does not include shipping expenses. These costs shall be borne by the Customer and will be added to the total cost of the selected Products. The cost of the contracted delivery service shall be determined by the selected conditions and mode of service. The Customer shall be duly notified of said costs, which shall be duly broken down prior to completion of the payment, before confirmation of the order and finalization of the contracting process.\n\n4.3. The prices shown in the Online Store apply only to the Products offered through said channel during the time in which they remain published. Majorica and the Points of Sale expressly reserve the right to change prices at any time without prior notice.

The charge of the price of the Products, the costs of the shipping service (where applicable) and any taxes that may apply shall be executed at the moment in which the order is completed.\n\n6.2. As an electronic payment system, Majorica and the Majorica Online Store have an e-commerce payment gateway installed. All data supplied to Majorica and to the Majorica Online Store to this end are encrypted to ensure maximum security thereof. It is handled on a certified secure server in accordance with ‚ÄúSecure Socket Layer‚Äù protocol.

Should, for availability reasons, the replacement of the product not be possible, a full refund of the purchase will be provided.\n\n9. GUARANTEES.\n\nIn the event in which a purchased Product presents a lack of conformity in that it does not correspond to the features offered, presents defects preventing its normal use in accordance with its nature, or does not offer the benefits attributed to it, the Customer shall be entitled to the acquired Product being repaired within three years of the purchase and under the conditions and with the evidence as regulated in the Revised Text of the General Law for the Defence of Consumers and Users, without prejudice to the powers of the Majorica Online Store to verify the truthfulness of the defects, their origin and their time of onset.
