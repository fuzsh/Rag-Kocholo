        "text": "Apheresis (Automated) Donation\n\nalso known as platelet donation, plasma donation, or double red cell donation\n\nThe apheresis process allows us to remove only a portion of your blood (platelets, plasma, red cells, or white blood cells). A needle will be placed in your arm. Blood will flow through the tubing attached to the needle into a system that will collect the desired component. The remainder of your blood will be returned to you through the same arm. The process will take 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the component(s) you are donating.\n\nYour body will replace the liquid part of your blood (called plasma) in just a few hours. The platelets and white blood cells will be replaced within 48 to 72 hours. If you donate red cells by automation alone, or with platelets and plasma, the red cells will be replaced within a few weeks. Certain height, weight, and hemoglobin requirements must be met to donate automated procedures.\n\nThe acceptable frequency for automated donations depends on the component(s) being collected at each donation. In general, the following intervals apply:\n\nPlatelet donation – once in a 7-day period and no more than 24 times in a rolling calendar year\n\nPlasma donation – every 28 days\n\nRed cells in conjunction with another component – every 8 weeks\n\nDouble red cell donation – every 16 weeks\n\nAll donors are subject to maximum red cell and plasma loss limits for a rolling calendar year. These limits are determined by the Food and Drug Administration and The Blood Connection medical staff. In the rare event of a mechanical failure or damage to your red cells during your donation, we may not be able to return part of your blood. Should this occur, you might not be allowed to donate again for 8 weeks (16 weeks, if giving a double unit of red cells).\n\nDonor Eligibility\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The information listed here covers the basics of donor eligibility. Your eligibility is determined by your completion of the Individual Donor Assessment (IDA) and screening process at the time of your donation. If you have any questions about your personal eligibility, please let us know during your screening or call us at 864.751.1153.\n\nSpecific Information\n\nTravel to (or Birth in) Other Countries\n\nMembers of US military, a civilian military employee or a dependent of a member of the US military between 1980 and 1996 can now donate blood! This was previously a deferral.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1996, did you spend time that adds up to 3 months or more in the United Kingdom countries of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, or the Falkland Islands? If yes, you may have been told you can’t donate blood – but you can now! Here’s the latest on these guidelines: CLICK HERE.\n\nYou cannot donate blood if you spent time that adds up to (5) five years or more in France and Ireland. The list below shows countries that are NOT on the deferral list, meaning if you lived there, you can donate blood.\n\nEuropean Countries/Cities no longer a deferral if time spent from 1980 to present added up to (5) years:\n\nAlbania Czech Republic Hungary Melilla Romania Austria Denmark Italy Yugoslavia Serbia Belgium Finland Kosovo Montenegro Slovak Republic Bosnia French Guiana Liechtenstein The Netherlands Slovenia Bulgaria Germany Luxembourg Norway Spain Canary Islands Greece Macedonia Poland Sweden Ceuta Guadeloupe Martinique Portugal, including the Azores Switzerland Croatia Herzegovina Mayotte Réunion\n\nSpecial Circumstances\n\nYou are deferred from donating blood if in the past 4 months you:\n\no Had a blood transfusion\n\no Had a transplant such as organ, tissue or bone marrow\n\no Come in contact with someone else’s blood\n\no Accidental needle-stick\n\no Sexual contact with a prostitute or anyone else who takes money, drugs, or other payment for sex\n\no Sexual contact with anyone who uses drugs, steroids or anything not prescribed by their doctor\n\no Corneal transplant\n\no Used needles to take drugs, steroids or anything not prescribed by your doctor\n\no Received money to take drugs, steroids, or anything not prescribed by your doctor\n\nSexual Contact\n\nWhy we ask questions about sexual contact:\n\nSexual contact may cause transmissible diseases to get into the bloodstream and be spread through transfusions to someone else.\n\nDefinition of sexual contact:\n\nThe terms sexual contact or sex are used in some of the questions you will be asked. These can mean different things to each of us, but in keeping with federal guidelines, these terms apply to any of the activities below, whether or not a condom or other protection was used during sexual contact.\n\nVaginal sex (contact between penis and vagina).\n\nOral sex (mouth or tongue on someone’s vagina, penis, or anus).\n\nAnal sex (contact between penis and anus).\n\nHIV/AIDS Risk Behaviors and Symptoms\n\nAIDS is caused by HIV. HIV is spread mainly through sexual contact with an infected person or by sharing needles or syringes used for injecting drugs.\n\nDo Not Donate If You:\n\nHave AIDS or have ever had a positive HIV test.\n\nHave ever used needles to take drugs, steroids, or anything not prescribed by a doctor.\n\nHave ever taken money, drugs or other payment for sex since 1977.\n\nHave had sexual contact in the past 4 months with anyone described above.\n\nHave had syphilis or gonorrhea in the past 12 months.\n\nHave been in juvenile detention, lockup, jail, or prison for more than 72 hours in the last 12 months.\n\nHave any of the following conditions that can be signs or symptoms of HIV/AIDS:\n\nUnexplained weight loss or night sweats.\n\nBlue or purple spots in the mouth or on your skin.\n\nSwollen lymph nodes for more than one month.\n\nWhite spots or unusual spots in your mouth.\n\nCough that won’t go away or shortness of breath.\n\nDiarrhea that won’t go away.\n\nFever of more than 100.5 degrees F for more than 10 days.\n\nRemember that you can transmit HIV to someone else through blood transfusions even when feeling well and have a negative HIV test because tests cannot detect infections for a period of time after a person is exposed to HIV. Do not give blood only as a means for an AIDS or hepatitis test. Confidential AIDS testing is available at the local health department or call 1.800.322.AIDS for more information."
