        "text": "What types of products are eligible for FloorScore® certification?\n\nCementitious Flooring, Ceramic, Cork Flooring, Flooring Adhesives, Hardwood Engineered and Bamboo Flooring, Laminate Flooring, Linoleum, Polymeric Flooring, Porcelain, Raised Flooring, Rubber Flooring, Underlayments, Vinyl Composite Tile (VCT), Vinyl Sheet Flooring, Vinyl Tile and Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT), Wall Base, Stair Treads, and Accessories.\n\nWhat does it take to get certified?\n\nFlooring products must undergo the evaluation process, which includes a review of the product’s formulation and the manufacturing site’s document control system, an onsite audit, and product emissions testing.\n\nDoes FloorScore meet CA 01350? Which VOCs are tested?\n\nFloorScore tests for 35 individual Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) specified by the California Standard Method for VOC Emissions Testing and Evaluation (Standard Method V1.2), otherwise known as CA Section 01350.\n\nWhat is the difference between the CARB and FloorScore certifications?\n\nThe regulatory formaldehyde emissions requirements per the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Airborne Toxic Control Measure (ATCM 93120) and the EPA Formaldehyde Rule applies solely to formaldehyde emissions from composite wood panel products (e.g. MDF, particleboard, hardwood plywood (veneer or composite core).\n\nThe voluntary green building indoor air quality certification of FloorScore applies to finished flooring products tested for 35 individual VOC emissions (including formaldehyde).\n\nWhat are Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)?\n\nThe US EPA defines VOCs as “any compound of carbon, excluding carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, and ammonium carbonate, which participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions.\" VOC gases are emitted from certain solids or liquids, and include a variety of organic chemicals, some of which may have short-term and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. Find more information on VOCs at RFCI and CDPH.\n\nDo you test for phthalates?\n\nThe FloorScore standard is a VOC emission based standard for indoor air quality and does not include phthalates within its scope because it is not considered an emission source when manufactured in products like vinyl flooring. Primary exposure concerns for phthalates occur through ingestion, such as with toys or plastic bottles. Manufacturers may choose to have products tested for phthalate content at a qualified lab.\n\nCan SCS tell me a product’s VOC emissions profile that I plan to purchase?\n\nWhile SCS has access to the emissions results for products it certifies, it is not allowed to disclose a client’s data. For specific emissions data requests, you may contact the manufacturer directly.\n\nWhere can I find FloorScore products?\n\nThe SCS Green Products Guide has a complete and searchable list of all FloorScore certified products.\n\nHow much does FloorScore certification cost?\n\nThe cost of FloorScore certification is determined by the specific scope of products and operations to be assessed.\n\nDoes SCS provide private label FloorScore certification for flooring distributors?\n\nYes, SCS will work with the distributors and the FloorScore certified manufacturers to undergo private label certification. For more information and to apply, review our Private Label brochure.\n\nI use an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to manufacture my products. Can I still qualify for FloorScore certification?\n\nThere are two options available:\n\nEncourage your manufacturer to become FloorScore certified and then apply for a private label certification.\n\nPursue certification and use the OEM as your product manufacturing site.\n\nDoes SCS provide certification support?\n\nSCS provides on-going program support, including staff assistance, marketing and promotional support, and information about new or revised requirements. Certified clients will receive information about the logo use guidelines for both packaging and marketing purposes.\n\nDoes SCS provide marketing support?\n\nAs part of the certification package, our team provides marketing support and education to your sales team to help promote your successful certification."
