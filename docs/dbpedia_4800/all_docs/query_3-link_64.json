        "text": "Both the front and rear hub spacing are bicycle frame and/or fork specific. The front hub width measurement is directly related to the spacing between your fork dropouts. The frame measurement is also related to the spacing of the frame dropout width. Oftentimes the hub spacing can simply be measured (in millimeters) from the fork or frame, or referenced on the bike/fork manufacturer’s website. Keep in mind that hub spacing can be model year/generation specific, so the 2017 model may have a different hub configuration than the 2018 model. For any questions related to wheel or hub specifications, please refer to your local bike shop or the Industry Nine Service Department at (828) 210-5113 or at www.industrynine.com\n\nHub endcaps can be classified into two categories and are bike frame/fork dependent: (1) QR (quick release) and (2) thru-axle. The majority of high end, modern bikes now are built with thru-axles. Thru-axle dimensions are typically measured in axle diameter (mm) x axle width (mm). If your hub skewer can be dis-assembled easily and has small conical springs, it is a QR type. Thru-axles and skewers are not included with wheels or hubs.\n\nEndcap dimensions correlate directly with hubshell width. Below are some common fitments and their corresponding thru-axle configurations:\n\nBoost front: 110mm in width - most modern trail bikes are 15x110\n\nNon-boost front: 100mm in width: 15x100\n\nRockShox Torque Caps - A wider diameter (31mm) endcap face that is specific to certain RockShox mountain bike forks claiming a stiffer interface between the fork and front wheel. Check with your local bike shop or with RockShox to determine if your RockShox fork is Torque Caps compatible. The thru-axle diameter remains 15mm.\n\nSuperboost rear: 12x157mm rear, although our 12x150mm builds use the same Superboost hubshell.\n\nBoost rear: 12x148mm rear endcaps\n\nNon-boost rear: QR135mm or 12x142mm rear hubshell\n\nDownhill (double/dual crown) forks are 20x110 width to withstand bigger hits and heavier loads. However, double crown forks come in 20x110 boost and 20x110 non-boost. Please refer to your local bike shop or fork manufacturer to determine hub fitment.\n\nThe cassette that you plan on mounting to your rear i9 hub determines the freehub type. For any questions refer to your local bike shop or the cassette manufacturer. A guide for common cassette types can be found below. Please note, other brands such as TRP, E13, Suntour, etc. use common FH compatibilities, please refer to your owners manual for more information.\n\nCassette Type (Mountain)Industry Nine freehub compatibility Shimano 12 speed Micro Spline (MS) Shimano 7-11 speedHG SRAM GX, X01, XX1, Eagle + SRAM “XG-” cassettesXD SRAM NX + all other SRAM “PG-” cassettesHG Single Speed cogs (use with spacer kit, not incl.)HG\n\nThe cassette that you plan on mounting to your rear i9 hub determines the freehub type.

The rotor style is easily distinguished by how the brake rotor mounts to the hub. 6 bolt rotors are fastened to the hub with 6 separate bolts, whereas center lock rotors use a central lockring and require a bottom bracket tool (for 15mm/20mm thru-axles) or cassette lockring tool (for 12mm thru axle or QR style). Bolts and lockings are not included with wheels or hubs."
