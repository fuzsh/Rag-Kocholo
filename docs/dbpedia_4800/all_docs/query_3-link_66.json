        "text": "Waiters dart like hummingbirds between crowded tables, dressed sharply in white collared shirts and slim black pants. Plates land before us, piled precariously high with fried calamari and grilled shrimp, bowls of bubbling-hot split pea soup, and a whole grouper, smothered in herbs. We're at Vista Mar, a little seaside restaurant in El Jebha, a port town in northern Morocco tucked tightly between two hills that faces the Mediterranean Sea. From our table, we look out over the water, where a group of lanky teenagers dive off the prow of one of the larger boats and race each other to the shore. Wooden fishing boats are moored along the seawall, while small launches outfitted with pink and orange umbrellas ferry swimmers and sunbathers to the little coves up and down the coast. The sounds, the sights, the smells; it takes a minute to remember that we're in Morocco.\n\nOnce our plates are cleared and the lunch crowd thins, strong coffee sweetened with honey arrives, and we get out our map. My friend Anouar Akrouh and I have already driven three and a half hours east from Tangier—past the white city of Tétouan and the glitzy seaside resorts of Cabo Negro, beyond the low-key beach towns of Ouad Lao and Steha. We're following the N16 highway on a weeklong road trip through a part of the country known as the Rif, a swath of northeastern Morocco loosely bound by Tangier to the west, the Mediterranean to the north, the Moulouya River valley near the Moroccan-Algerian border to the east, and the Ouergha River to the south. The area is a surprising mash-up of mountain, coastal, and desert landscapes.\n\nMy fascination with this part of my adopted country—where I've spent about six months of the year for the better part of a decade—stems as much from what I don't know about it as what I do. The Rif doesn't have the vast medinas of Fez, the surf scene of Essaouira, or the bustling spice and craft markets of Marrakech. If you ask around, most Western Moroccans will describe it vaguely as rugged and untamed. They might mention its notorious independent streak, which over the centuries prompted rebellions against French, Spanish, and Arab colonizers. But if pushed, most will cop to the fact that they've never actually been.\n\nIt wasn't until I met Anouar in Tangier two years ago that I began to form a clearer image of the region. Anouar, who was born in the port city of Al Hoceima, told me stories about the Rif's incredible beauty, about quiet coves and mountain gorges where towering cedar forests gleam with snow in the winter and bloom with rockrose and wild lavender in the summer. He now runs an architectural firm in Tangier but goes back to the Rif with his camera whenever he has a break from work.\n\nYears of isolation—on account of the steep Rif mountains—have helped the area retain its unique Berber heritage. Unlike the rest of the country, its colonial imprint skews more Spanish than French, and its dominant language, Tarifit, is unlike the Moroccan Arabic spoken in the rest of the country. While the western part of the country grows a variety of fruits and vegetables, the main crop here has long been cannabis. Anouar explained that there is a lingering local belief that the previous king, Hassan II, actively ignored the Rif in retaliation for its earlier attempts at independence. However, the current king, Mohammed VI, has worked hard to eliminate the mutual mistrust through large investments in the area. As a result, modern infrastructure has begun to arrive in the last several years, making some of the unspoiled coastline easily accessible for the first time.\n\nAfter sitting down with Anouar and looking through his photographs, I realized I had to make the trip myself. With the new paved highways and small lodges cropping up, it seemed like the right time to finally check out this often overlooked part of Morocco. So we decided to do it, armed with my curiosity and Anouar's expertise and camera—and sturdy Land Rover.\n\nWe pull off the highway and follow a dirt road toward the sea. Farmhouses dot the landscape, and when I roll down my window I can hear families in the fields harvesting wheat, chatting over the rhythmic swish-swish of their sickles. We park the car and walk out to a small cliff overlooking the village of Cala Iris, about 40 miles east of El Jebha, and watch as the setting sun paints the sky pink, then purple.\n\nIt's dark by the time we reach Al Hoceima, Anouar's hometown. The city was struck by three major earthquakes over the past three decades, which destroyed most of the old traditional adobe houses and shops. New buildings have popped up in their place, including several apartment towers overlooking the bay, where a Spanish fortress stands tall on a tiny island off of the coast. After dropping our bags at the Mercure Quemado Resort Hotel, we buy fresh shrimp and a few red mullets from a fishmonger. At one of the bustling restaurants along the quay we hand over the seafood to a waiter, and 15 minutes later it comes out, grilled to perfection and served with tangy beets and a white bean salad.\n\nAt daybreak the coffee shops are filled with locals enjoying cumin-dusted omelets and small loaves of disk-shaped bread. Anouar and I meet up with Mohammed, a childhood friend of his who has come back to Al Hoceima to work as a guide. For a short period, Mohammed worked as a fisherman in the south and a barista in Tangier, but the pull of the area's beaches and nature brought him home. We hop in his car to explore the 185-square-mile Al Hoceima National Park and wildlife refuge.\n\nLunch in the tiny village of Adouz is the highlight of our day. In a long, narrow room we gather around a low table alongside several villagers Mohammed knows, digging into a large tagine of slow-roasted chicken with our hands. We sip glasses of leben, a lightly fermented buttermilk that is cool and rich. After lunch a chatty six-year-old, the son of one of the villagers, leads us through the town's mazelike footpaths. “We call him the mayor,” his father says with a laugh as the boy marches through Adouz repeating the local gossip and pointing out the large mosque Islamic scholars built in the 14th century.\n\nThere are few things better than a late-afternoon dip in the Mediterranean. Mohammed takes us to Plage Badis, one of his favorite beaches. It is famous for a massive fort, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, that seems to rise from the sea but is actually connected to the shore by a narrow isthmus. “That's Spain,” Anouar tells me, pointing to the fort, “and this is the shortest international border in the world.” This small acre of rock, along with a few tiny islands and the contested cities of Ceuta and Melilla, are the last remaining European territories in mainland Africa. As the three of us make our way to the beach, I can see a Spanish flag draped from one of the turrets and a few armed soldiers. The border is marked by a navy blue fishing rope strung across the little sandy spit that links the two countries. With the day coming to a close, we dive into the cool water and swim out under the towering stronghold.\n\nAfterward, we say farewell to the Mediterranean Sea and the N16 Highway and drive southeast, toward the Algerian border. Our next stop is to visit Younès Ismaili, an architect and old friend of Anouar's family, who has promised us a sneak peek at his new eco-lodge, L'Écogîte Arnane, which is just outside the town of Tafoughalt, in the province of Berkane. We arrive in a wide valley, filled with terraced olive groves, that is utterly unlike yesterday's coastal farms and salt breezes. The air here is dry and fragrant.\n\n“Just about every ingredient comes from my farm,” Younès says. We're sitting on low banquettes around a small wooden table. Outside, there are fruit orchards and miles of hiking and horseback trails. He brings us minced vegetables simmered with raisins and spices and a tender chicken tagine. This is true home cooking—nuanced and delicious.\n\n“Pick me up in the morning,” Younès says with a smile as we depart. “I've got something good planned.”\n\nAfter a breakfast of fried eggs and rghaif, a flaky Moroccan pancake smothered in local honey and jam, we return to fetch Younès. The road takes us through cork and pine forests before descending into the Zegzel Valley, in the Beni Snassen Mountains. Soon a farmhouse, one story and built of smooth slate blocks that are almost indigo in color, comes into view. Younès has brought us to visit Nordine, a farmer he met years ago while hiking around these mountains, who invites us in for a lunch of tender artichoke hearts packed with spices and a roast lamb that falls off the bone. Afterward we walk the countryside, coming upon open cisterns that collect and distribute spring water through a series of rills, or canals. Younès sees my fascination. “Are you interested in water?” he asks, grinning. As if answering some riddle, he adds, “Then maybe you should go to the desert. Maybe you should go to Figuig.”\n\nJust one road leads to Figuig. It's a flat stretch of highway that parallels the Algerian border, cutting through the desert scrub past nomads tending their flocks. This is the frontier, with a military checkpoint every 50 or so miles; the officers, seeing that we are tourists, wave us through. About 350 miles south of the Mediterranean coast, Figuig was once a famous crossroads where caravans would load up before heading deeper into the Sahara. Now the town is known mostly for its dates and as part of a Moroccan expression: Foug Figuig, which means “doing beyond great.”\n\nAt dawn, a sea of dense palms stretches before us. From our vantage point above the oasis we can see the mountain ridges that surround the city, protecting it from the relentless desert. As the sun rises, it illuminates clusters of sandy buildings and emerald pools among the trees. Frogs croak their morning song, joined by a single lonely howl.\n\nBy midmorning, Anouar and I are having tea with a farmer who has invited us to see his fields. What had looked like a dense palm grove from above is actually a lush network of wheat, zucchini, mint, and tomato plots fed by a network of rills that carry water from a natural pool to the crops below. Oasis towns like this have largely disappeared. With paved roads, refrigerated trucks, and airplanes, the old trade routes and resting places are no longer necessary. As we walk around Figuig, we hear the ring-ring of bicyclists navigating the town's narrow, ancient streets and pass men and women who still wear the traditional white robes.\n\nOver lunch at the Auberge Oasis, an airy bed-and-breakfast in a traditional adobe riad, we chat with Fatima and her sister, the women who run it. They tell us with some urgency that they don't get many visitors, and even fewer since the pandemic, but that those who do come are curious and respectful and have made some extra effort to visit this fragile desert ecosystem. When the temperature rises past 100 degrees, Anouar and I follow the directions the farmer we met earlier gave us and make our way to a swimming hole. Two young men are there already, slowly kicking against the current of the constantly rushing water. We are five days out and more than 600 miles from Tangier. “I never expected to find this,” Anouar says, smiling. I know he is talking about this improbable swimming hole, in the middle of a fading oasis town surrounded by the desert, but he could be referring to the entire trip. I nod in agreement.\n\nThis article appeared in the December 2021 issue of Condé Nast Traveler. Subscribe to the magazine here."
