        "text": "With the closure of state hospitals beginning in the 1970’s and the shrinking resources in many communities, there is a large and disproportionate number of seriously mentally ill individuals under correctional custody and supervision. Researchers document a serious mental illness in 15% of incarcerated men and 31% of incarcerated women, rates in excess of three to six times those found in the general population.\n\nThe magnitude of the problem of untreated mental illness is revealed not only in the numbers, but also in the consequences. These individuals are more likely to experience suicide, victimization, violence, and unpredictable crises.\n\nTypically, when a correctional and detention center is faced with a crisis, the first reaction is to call upon SORT/CERT, or its equivalent, for a swift response and resolution. Correctional and detention leaders, community members and mental health advocates all agree upon the premise that first responders’ swift response is a necessary component to facility safety and security. Disparity occurs and criticism arises when there are unfortunate consequences to the response such as inmate injury, staff injury and/or property damage.\n\nCIT training is the bridge to narrowing the gap by providing front line staff with the needed skills and competencies to handle potentially dangerous individuals experiencing crisis situations. Additionally, it provides training for officers regarding behavioral health issues and educating community members about the role and needs of correctional and detention staff so both sides are more able to effectively utilize each other to benefit inmates and their families.\n\nThe History of CIT\n\nCIT for Law Enforcement began in Memphis, TN in the late 1980s after a tragedy involving a person with serious mental illness. The community came together with the Police Director and the Mayor of Memphis to find a more effective way for officers to respond to persons with mental illness in crisis. The partnerships that helped create CIT included the Police Department, Memphis University, The University of Tennessee Regional Medical Center, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Lakeside Hospital, other mental health centers, National Alliance on Mental Illness, family members and other advocates. This model takes a team approach and engages community stakeholders, including corrections agencies, local mental health agencies, family advocacy groups and others, in a collaborative and responsive effort to manage and support justice involved persons with mental illness.\n\nIn 2010, The National Institute of Corrections realized that there was an opportunity to formally introduce the CIT Law Enforcement Model to corrections and detention agencies. The CIT Program for Corrections and Detention applies to jails, prisons and community agencies alike. It focuses on building an agency’s capacity to implement a locally owned and administered CIT program and the training for that program.\n\nFrom December 2010 to March 2014, NIC implemented Phase I of its CIT Program for Corrections and Detentions. During this time staff, representing 19 jail systems, 20 state departments of corrections, and one team from U.S. Probation and Parole, was trained in the tenets of CIT. These three-person teams (mental health advocate, operations executive, behavioral health clinician) were encouraged to take the information learned at the National Corrections Academy in Aurora, Colorado back to their respective agencies to strategically plan the implementation of a locally-owned CIT program. In June 2014, NIC implemented Phase II(also referred to as a Partnership Training Program) of its CIT initiative. This 40-hour classroom based CIT program is held at a host state department of correction or jail.\n\nImplementing CIT with NIC\n\nThe Partnership Training Program involves a simultaneous meeting and training schedule whereby the host agency’s Executive Steering Committee for CIT is briefed on the tenets of CIT, how to replicate and sustain the CIT Program while staff receives the 40-hour CIT classroom-based instruction.\n\nIn preparation for the training, NIC will conduct a site visit and tour of the facility and the training location with agency command staff.\n\nApply for CIT Technical Assistance\n\nPreview the CIT Site Visit Schedule\n\nPreview the CIT Training Schedule\n\nMany corrections systems isolate certain prisoners from the general prison population; a practice known as special management confinement or segregation. The use of isolation and segregation has increased over the years, in part as a response to the rise in prison gangs and prison violence. Depending on the system, these units are identified as restricted housing (preferred), special housing, maximum control, extended control, supermax, disciplinary housing, secured housing, close custody, administrative segregation, intensive management, and administrative maximum penitentiary or unit. The following is a list of documents, guidelines, articles, and studies that examine how restricted housing units function.\n\nDepartmental Segregation Units\n\nMassachusetts Department of Corrections, 2017\n\nSpecial Housing Units\n\nNew York Corrections and Community Supervision, 2017\n\nSpecial Housing Units\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, 2016\n\nU.S. Department of Justice Report and Recommendations Concerning the Use of Restrictive Housing\n\nU.S. Department of Justice, 2016\n\nThis Report was drafted to provide an overview of restrictive housing in the American criminal justice system and propose recommendations for safely reducing the use of this practice.\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons: Special Housing Unit Review and Assessment\n\nMcGinnis, Kenneth, et al., 2014\n\nThe review was designed to assess the Bureau’s use of restricted housing (SHUs, SMUs, and the ADX); identify best practices; and identify potential improvements in practice and policy.\n\nReassessing Solitary Confinement II: The Human Rights, Fiscal, and Public Safety Consequences\n\nU.S. Congress, Senate. Committee on the Judiciary Subcommitee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights, 2014\n\nThis webcast is the second to address issues associated with the wide use of solitary confinement in the United States. Access to this program is provided at this website. Transcripts of witness testimony are also provided from Charles E. Samuels, Jr., The Honorable Craig DeRoche, Piper Kerman, Marc Levin, Rick Raemisch, and Damon Thibodeaux, and The Honorable Dick Durbin.\n\nDocument ID: 027970\n\nAdministrative Segregation, Degrees of Isolation, and Incarceration: A National Overview of State and Federal Correctional Policies\n\nMetcalf, Hope; et al. A Project of the Liman Public Interest Program at Yale Law School, 2013\n\n“This report provides an overview of state and federal policies related to long-term isolation of inmates, a practice common in the United States and one that has drawn attention in recent years from many sectors. All jurisdictions in the United States provide for some form of separation of inmates from the general population. Prison administrators see the ability to separate inmates as central to protecting the safety of both inmates and staff. Yet many correctional systems are reviewing their use of segregated confinement; as controversy surrounds this form of control, its duration, and its effects” (p. 1). Sections following an overview of findings include: criteria for placement in administrative segregation; procedures and processes for placement; periodic review; and conditions, step-down programs, visitation, and degrees of isolation.\n\nDocument ID: 027420\n\nBureau of Prisons: Improvements Needed in Bureau of Prisons' Monitoring and Evaluation of Impact of Segregated Housing\n\nU.S. Government Accountability Office, 2013\n\nThe segregated housing unit practices of the United States Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and compliance with them are reviewed. Sections comprising this report are: background to the investigation; Segregated Housing Unit population and number of cells have increased since Fiscal Year 2008; BOP’s monitoring of segregated housing policies varies by type of unit, and some facilities’ documentation is incomplete; BOP estimates that segregated housing costs more than housing inmates in the general population; BOP has not evaluated the impact of segregated housing units on institutional safety or the impacts of long-term segregation on inmates; concluding remarks; recommendations for Executive Action; and BOP comments and GAO evaluation. “GAO recommends that BOP (1) develop ADX-specific monitoring requirements; (2) develop a plan that clarifies how BOP will address documentation concerns GAO identified, through the new software program; (3) ensure that any current study to assess segregated housing also includes reviews of its impact on institutional safety; and (4) assess the impact of long-term segregation. BOP agreed with these recommendations and reported it would take actions to address them.\"\n\nDocument ID: 027354\n\nReview of the Use of Segregation for ICE Detainees\n\nU.S. Dept. of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 2013\n\n“This directive establishes policy and procedures for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) review of ICE detainees placed into segregated housing … Placement of detainees in segregated housing is a serious step that requires careful consideration of alternatives. Placement in segregation should occur only when necessary and in compliance with applicable detention standards. In particular, placement in administrative segregation due to a special vulnerability should be used only as a last resort and when no other viable housing options exist … Consistent with the agency's detention standards and relevant special housing policies, ICE shall take additional steps to ensure appropriate review and oversight of decisions to retain detainees in segregated housing for over 14 days, or placements in segregation for any length of time in the case of detainees for whom heightened concerns exist based on known special vulnerabilities and other factors related to the detainee's health or the risk of victimization” (p. 1). Sections of this policy cover: ICE division responsibilities; field review of detainee segregation status; facility compliance; ICE headquarters oversight and reporting regarding use of segregation; and training.\n\nAdministrative Segregation\n\nColorado Department of Corrections, 2012\n\nThis administrative regulation (AR) establishes criteria and guidelines for placing offenders on administrative segregation status. Administrative segregation is an offender management process and is not used as a punitive measure\" (p. 1). Procedures cover: assignment to administrative segregation; behavior warranting administrative segregation review after admission to the DOC; multi-disciplinary staffing; administrative segregation hearings and due process; offender appeal; general conditions of confinement; progressive management; administrative segregation privilege levels; level movement; monitoring and reviews; release from administrative segregation; and administrative segregation ACA standards.\n\nDocument ID: 026424\n\nQuestion:\n\nWe get periodic complaints from inmates about the temperature in their cells. Sometimes we do issue extra blankets but need to watch for hoarding. Is there an ideal temperature setting for institutional housing units?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThere are recommended ranges of temperature (often called comfort zones) which can vary by season. The problem is there is an objective component but also a subjective component (not everybody \"feels\" temperature or comfort the same). Since heating and cooling systems in institutions are complex, try to achieve a \"happy medium\" within the recommended ranges.\n\nThis issue is not as simple as temperature. Thermal comfort is a combination of temperature, humidity, activity levels, metabolic rate, clothing, season, etc. It gets really complex. To appreciate how complex calculating thermal comfort is, look at the factors needed for this Thermal Comfort Tool online calculator.\n\nThe American Correctional Association standards, which are voluntary unless you are undergoing accreditation with them, state:\n\n\"Temperature and humidity are mechanically raised or lowered to acceptable comfort levels.\" The previous version of that standard used to refer to \"acceptable summer and winter comfort zones.\"\n\nThe general standard concerning building comfort levels is ASHRAE 55 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy. (2010). Builders and maintenance folks tend to conform to ASHRAE 55 standards in terms of building thermal comfort. They are not mandatory unless they have been adopted as part of a jurisdiction's building code or environment climate codes.\n\nA given temperature will not meet the needs of everybody in the same environment. While not a jail or prison but an office environment, this article The Thermal Comfort Zone concludes that it may not be possible to provide thermal conditions that please all occupants all the time (but that hasn't stopped facilities managers from trying):\n\n\"ASHRAE indicates thermal comfort is achieved when environmental conditions satisfy 80 percent of office occupants suggests just how difficult it is to please all occupants even some of the time.\"\n\nBottom line: consider this in your decision making\n\nHow many inmates are requesting extra blankets? If it is just a few, you are probably within norms, but might want to honor those requests. Everybody feels temperature differently, so those requests can be legitimate. So unless there is a hoarding issue, or it has become a \"game\", perhaps second blankets are easier than inmate grievances, litigation, and behavior issues.\n\nKeep in mind some differences: 70 degrees with low humidity might feel cool to an inactive population while staff who are moving around feel just fine. So anything in a range of 69-76 degrees could be acceptable in terms of thermal comfort depending on levels of humidity (and factoring in ambient conditions in summer or winter).\n\nA good solution is to get your agency to request an assessment by a legitimate building services provider or institutional heating and cooling systems specialist to measure comfort levels in all housing units. It is important to document your efforts at providing an acceptable housing environment for the offenders.\n\nHere is how a major jail system deals with issues around \"abnormal temperature conditions\" . It might give you some ideas for policy and procedure. It actually comes in collaboration their Department of Environment Health:\n\nWhat temperatures (indoor and outdoor) are considered outside the normal range and require notifications/actions?\n\nThe Department requires that tour commanders notify the warden and the assistant commissioner for environmental health of any temperatures that are below 68° F. in all are as and above 80° F. in medical, mental health, and air conditioned areas. The assistant commissioner for environmental health initiates two hour temperature monitoring, so that decisions can be made whether inmates need to be relocated. For temperatures below 68° F. maintenance is notified to repair the heating system. Inmates are provided with additional blankets, clothing if necessary, and hot beverages. Inmates are relocated if the heat will not be repaired in a reasonable number of hours and the temperature remains below 68° F., if maintenance determines that the heat cannot be repaired, or if the temperature is below 60° F. Again, this is at the discretion of the assistant commissioner for environmental health and security. At temperatures at or above 80° F., maintenance is notified to repair the air conditioning, ice is provided for the inmates, two fans are placed in the housing areas, and it is determined how many heat sensitive inmates are housed in the area. Heat sensitive inmates will be relocated if the temperatures reaches or exceeds 85° F., if the temperature remains above 80° F. for a period of time and maintenance is unable to resolve the issue within a reasonable amount of time, or if the air conditioning cannot be repaired that day. Any non-heat sensitive inmates will remain in the housing area.\n\nAt what temperatures, both hot and cold, is outdoor recreation restricted?\n\nAt what high and low temperatures is it prohibited? Outdoor recreation is canceled at the discretion of the tour commander since it is voluntary and inmates may decide not to participate.\n\nHow is the status of \"heat risk inmate\" conveyed by medical staff to correctional staff?\n\nThe medical staff submit a heat sensitive identification form to the clinic captain.\n\nWhat are the temperature thresholds for heat risk subjects?\n\nIn general, heat sensitive inmates are housed in air conditioned areas. The Department makes notification of high temperatures at 80° F. allowing time to correct the air conditioning deficiency before we would relocate the heat sensitive inmates at 85° F.\n\nWhat discretionary language, if any, is used to permit judgment calls with regard to allowing outdoor recreation?\n\nOutdoor recreation is held at the discretion of the tour commander.\n\nStaff Recruitment and Retention in Corrections\n\nCorrections Today, 2023\n\nEmployees are the most valuable assets in corrections, especially when managed, trained, and appropriately utilized for success. Corrections relies on well-trained, experienced, and devoted workforces to provide the most cost-effective required security service to their community and stay on track with the larger mission of public safety.\n\nEmployee Retention: Preventing a “Great Resignation” in Your Public Safety Agency\n\nScism, Rex, 2022\n\nWhy are employees throwing in the towel, and how can public safety leaders slow the exodus?\n\nWhy Does No One Want to Be a Correctional Officer?!\n\nCarter, TaLisa J., 2022\n\nBeing a corrections officer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is one of the least desirable professions in the United States. The attrition rate for US correctional officers is high, with 40 percent of state correctional officers in Texas, for example, leaving their jobs in 2020. Currently, at least 12 states have officer vacancies of 20 percent or more, and Mississippi and Alabama have 50 and 58 percent of correctional officer positions empty.\n\nCountering Threats to Correctional Institution Security\n\nRusso, Joe, Woods, Dulani, Jackson, Brian A. (2019)\n\nIn light of the ongoing challenges the corrections sector faces in countering these threats, RAND researchers convened an expert workshop to better understand the challenges and identify the high-priority needs associated with threats to institutional security.\n\nBuilding a High-Quality Correctional Workforce: Identifying Challenges and Needs\n\nRusso, Joe, Woods, Dulani, Drake, George B., Jackson, Brian A. (2018)\n\nThis report presents the results of an expert panel discussion focused on identifying and prioritizing ways to address workforce concerns in the corrections sector. Panelists identified needs related to recruitment, selection, onboarding, retention, leadership development, and misconduct that, if addressed, would help to build a high-quality workforce.\n\nThe Corrections Profession: Maintaining Safety and Sanity, Part 1\n\nSpinaris, Caterina, Mike Denhof, and Greg Morton, Desert Waters Correctional Outreach, National Institute of Corrections (NIC) Academy, 2014\n\nThe webinar will describe a process model developed and modified over several years by DWCO [Desert Waters Correctional Outreach], entitled “From Corrections Fatigue to Fulfillment™.” Once Corrections Fatigue manifests, it can promote toxic adaptations to work demands, consequently undermining job performance, employee morale, health, personal and professional relationships, and employee retention.”\n\nDocument ID: 027907\n\nThe Corrections Profession: Maintaining Safety and Sanity, Part 2\n\nSpinaris, Caterina, Mike Denhof, and Greg Morton, Desert Waters Correctional Outreach, National Institute of Corrections (NIC) Academy, 2014\n\nThis program is the second of a two-part webinar, and covers the physical and emotional challenges faced by correctional personnel. “The dangers correctional staff encounter on the job are well known to their leaders. A lesser known but possibly more hazardous set of factors involves the cumulative negative side effects of what staff experience through daily interactions with justice-involved individuals and immersion in uniquely challenging workplace conditions. Such side effects can be understood as examples of “Corrections Fatigue.”\n\nDocument ID: 027908\n\nOrganizational Stressors Associated With Job Stress and Burnout in Correctional Officers: A Systematic Review\n\nFinney, Caitlin; Stergiopoulos, Erene; Hensel, Jennifer; Bonato, Sarah; and Carolyn S. Dewa, BMC Public Health, 2013\n\nThe results of this review indicate that the organizational structure and climate of correctional institutions has the most consistent relationship with COs’ job stress and burnout. Limitations of the studies reviewed include the cross-sectional design and the use of varying measures for organizational stressors. The results of this review indicate that interventions should aim to improve the organizational structure and climate of the correctional facility by improving communication between management and COs.\n\nShould I Stay or Should I Go? Job Satisfaction and Turnover Intent of Jail Staff Throughout the United States\n\nLeip, Leslie A.; and Jeanne B. Stinchcomb, Criminal Justice Review, 2013\n\n\"This study analyzes data from a national survey of 1,924 line-level jail staff to assess the impact of both work-related variables and personal characteristics on the intention of employees to resign.\"\n\nDocument ID: 027698\n\nCorrectional Officers: Strategies to Improve Retention\n\nNink, Carl, Management & Training Corporation (MTC) Institute, 2010\n\n\"This report explores issues impacting correctional agencies and companies, such as changing workforce demands, a dynamic labor market, predictors of turnover, and various reasons for why COs (correctional officers) leave their positions.\"\n\nThe Future is Now: Recruiting, Retaining, and Developing the 21st Century Jail Workforce\n\nStinchcomb, Jeanne B.; McCampbell, Susan W.; and Leslie Leip, Center for Innovative Public Policies, Inc., 2009\n\nThis \"comprehensive workforce planning blueprint\" is designed to help jail administrators in recruiting, retaining, and developing leaders.\n\nDocument ID: 023688"
