It may take a while for your hair to get used to our products. We ask you to be patient for a while. We also recommend not using more than what we recommend. For instance, for the Honey Infused Hair Oil we recommend not to use more than 1-3 drops.\n\nIf we could make one recommendation that works for all hair types, we suggest you try our iconic Honey Infused Hair Oil. Based on a homemade family recipe with honey from the Mirsalehi Bee Garden, the Honey Infused Hair Oil is the ultimate multipurpose oil for frizz prevention, hydration, nourishment and shine. We offer it in a 100ml and 50ml bottle. However, what products you use all depends on your own needs. You can reach out to info@gisou.com.\n\nGisou products are created to be effective on their own as well as in combination with each other. The Honey Infused care line focuses on the care element within your haircare regime, whereas the Propolis Infused styling line helps to protect and style your hair. One of our favorite product combinations is Negin’s overnight treatment using the Honey Infused Hair Mask with the Honey Infused Hair Oil. Please see the full DIY recipe here. Please also see our Combo Sets for some of our other favorite Gisou product combinations, conveniently at a better price!\n\nWe’re sorry about your unfavorable experience with Gisou products. It may take some time for your hair to get used to our products based on how they are formulated. We advise trying our products for a longer period of time because we truly believe they will improve the state of your hair in the long-term. Also, when applying the Honey Infused Hair Oil, a drop or two is really all you need to nourish and moisturize. We hope this helps and that you'll consider continuing trying our products. Please reach out to info@gisou.com if you have any product-related questions.\n\nThe proper way to use the dropper is to: gently squeeze the teat and hold for 3 seconds. Release the teat and let the tube fill itself with the Honey Infused Hair Oil for another 3 seconds. Gently pull the dropper out of the bottle and apply the Honey Infused Hair Oil to your hair accordingly.\n\nYou can definitely use the Honey Infused Hair Mask on dry hair. Simply apply a liberal amount to dry hair, leave it on overnight, if you desire, and rinse out.\n\nAlternatively, you can follow our other recommended routine, which consists of washing your hair with our Honey Infused Hair Wash and applying the Honey Infused Hair Mask (letting it soak 5-7 minutes before rinsing). If you’re curious to try this routine, we offer this combination of products at a discounted price as a Combo Set - please see the Super Shower Trio. To give your hair even more nourishment, you can also treat your hair to Negin’s signature deep treatment by adding a few drops of Honey Infused Hair Oil into your dosage of Honey Infused Hair Mask. This product combination is also available as a Combo Set - please see our Double Honey Duo.\n\nA shampoo opens the hair cuticles to cleanse the hair of dirt and product buildup. The open cuticles present the Honey Infused Hair Mask with the perfect opportunity to deliver its concentrated nourishment of vitamins and minerals. A conditioner helps to lock in all of the nourishment and moisture from the Honey Infused Hair Mask by sealing and closing the hair cuticle back up.\n\nAlthough we don't claim that any of our products are proven to promote hair growth, all of our haircare helps to maintain and improve the health of your hair and scalp, which may have a positive effect on hair growth. If we could make a suggestion to promote the health of your hair, we would start with your washing routine by trying out our sulfate- and silicone-free Honey Infused Hair Wash & Conditioner. For deep nourishment and hydration, we recommend enhancing your washing routine by using our Honey Infused Hair Mask 1-2 a week.\n\nWe are committed to reducing our impact on the environment. All of our paper-based packaging is made of FSC-certified paper from sustainably managed forests; we work with materials such as sugarcane, aluminum and recycled plastic instead of regular plastic; and we are continuously looking for ways to improve our packaging by working with more recycled, recyclable and biodegradable materials.\n\nYou can definitely use the Honey Infused Hair Mask on dry hair. Simply apply a liberal amount to dry hair, leave it on overnight, if you desire, and rinse out.\n\nAlternatively, you can follow our other recommended routine, which consists of washing your hair with our Honey Infused Hair Wash, applying the Honey Infused Hair Mask (letting it soak 5-7 minutes before rinsing), and following up with the Honey Infused Conditioner. If you’re curious to try this routine, we offer this combination of products at a discounted price as a Combo Set - please see the Super Shower Trio.

We never communicate or promote our products to be 100% natural or vegan. We do, however, promise that our products are created with all-natural, bee-sourced ingredients sustainably derived from the Mirsalehi Bee Garden, which will benefit your hair. The decision to include certain ingredients in our formulas is based on our belief that the result and the function of a product are just as important as the ingredients.\n\nGisou is created with the mission to support the honey bees and all that they do for the ecosystem. All Gisou products, which are enriched with ingredients from the Mirsalehi Bee Garden, are produced in a bee friendly and sustainable manner. We always prioritize the well-being of the bees and let them guide our beekeeping practices to obtain Mirsalehi Honey and Mirsalehi Propolis, our key ingredients, basing our production on the harvesting cycle, and only taking their surplus if and when appropriate. Please note that it is illegal to test cosmetic products or ingredients on animals, and we are of course in compliance with this law, as well as with all the European Cosmetic Regulations.\n\nNo, we unfortunately do not sell the Mirsalehi Honey at the moment, but perhaps in the future, if the Mirsalehi Honey Bees are up for it of course! Please read more about ‘Our Bee-Centered Approach’ here.\n\nAt Gisou, we are passionate about our Mirsalehi Honey Bees. That is why we let the bees guide our beekeeping practices to derive Mirsalehi Honey, Propolis, our key ingredients. We take only what the honey bees don’t need themselves - the surpluses - if and when appropriate, and base our production calendar on the harvesting cycle. We are currently not accredited by any cruelty-free organization, but please know that we have been working on it for some time now and are in the process of obtaining our accreditation by Cruelty-Free International."
