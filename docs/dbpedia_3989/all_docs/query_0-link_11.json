The town also takes pride in exemplary community enterprises like the fire brigade, among Germany’s best. It attracts attention with the Deutscher Wetterdienst where meteorological information from the whole northern hemisphere is processed daily.\n\nThe town of Offenbach am Main is twinned with Puteaux, joint winner of the 1956 Europe Prize (France), Esch-Sur-Alzette (Luxembourg), Köszeg (Hungary), Kawagoe (Japan), Mödling (Austria), Nahariya (Israel), Oryol (Russian Federation), Rivas (Nicaragua), Saint-Gilles-Lez-Bruxelles (Belgium), Tower Hamlets (United Kingdom), Velletri (Italy), Yangzhou (China) and Zemun (Serbia)."
