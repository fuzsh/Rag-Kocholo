        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nThis article is about the city in Hesse. For the town in Brandenburg, see Frankfurt (Oder). For other uses, see Frankfurt (disambiguation).\n\nFrankfurt am Main (Frankfurt on the Main) ( /ˈfræŋkfərt/; German pronunciation: [ˈfʁaŋkfʊɐ̯t am ˈmaɪ̯n] ( listen)), commonly known as Frankfurt, is the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2012 population of 704,449.[2] The urban area had an estimated population of 2,300,000 in 2010.[3] The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region which has a population of 5,600,000[4] and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region. Since the expansion of the European Union in 2007, the geographic midpoint of the European Union is about 40 kilometres east of Frankfurt am Main.\n\nFrankfurt is the financial and transport centre of Germany and the largest financial centre in continental Europe. It is the seat of the European Central Bank, the German Federal Bank, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the Frankfurt Trade Fair, as well as several large commercial banks, e.g. Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and DZ Bank. Frankfurt Airport is one of the world's busiest international airports, Frankfurt Central Station is one of the largest terminal stations in Europe, the Frankfurter Kreuz is one of the most heavily used Autobahn interchanges in Europe. Additionally, Frankfurt's DE-CIX is the world's largest internet traffic exchange point.\n\nFrankfurt is an international centre for finance, commerce, culture, transport, education, and tourism. It is therefore considered a global city (alpha world city) as listed by the Loughborough University group's 2010 inventory. Among global cities it was ranked 10th by the Global Power City Index 2011 and 11th by the Global City Competitiveness Index 2012. Among financial centers it was ranked 7th by the International Financial Centers Development Index 2012 and 10th by the Global Financial Centres Index 2013.\n\nIn 2011, the human-resource-consulting firm Mercer ranked Frankfurt as seventh in its annual \"Quality of Living\" survey of cities around the world.[5] According to The Economist cost of living survey, Frankfurt is Germany’s most expensive city, and the 10th most expensive in the world.[6]\n\nOverview[]\n\nThe three major pillars of Frankfurt's economy are finance, transport, and trade fairs.\n\nFrankfurt has been Germany's financial centre for centuries and it is the home of a number of major banks and brokerages. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) is by far Germany's largest, and is one of the world's most important. Frankfurt is also the seat of the European Central Bank (Europäische Zentralbank) which sets monetary policy for the Eurozone, consisting of 17 European Union member states that have adopted the euro (€) as their common currency and sole legal tender, and of the German Federal Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). In 2010, 63 national and 152 international banks had their registered offices here including the headquarters of the major German banks, notably Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, as well as 41 representative offices of international banks.[7]\n\nThe importance of Frankfurt as a financial centre is rising in recent years. Indications are the establishment of the European supervisory authority for insurance EIOPA (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) and the installation of the EU system risk-Council, the European authority for the early detection, prevention and management of systemic risks within the financial market in the EU. Additionally, the single European supervisory mechanism for the European banking union will be controlled by the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank from 2013 onwards aiming to supervise more than 6000 banks in the Euro zone.\n\nFrankfurt has an excellent transport infrastructure: Frankfurt Airport (Flughafen Frankfurt am Main) is the third busiest airport by passenger traffic in Europe and is the main hub for Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa, the largest airline in Europe. The airport is close to the Frankfurter Kreuz (Autobahn interchange) where two of the most heavily used motorways in Europe, Bundesautobahn 3 in west-east-direction and Bundesautobahn 5 in north-south-direction, meet. In addition, Frankfurt has three railway stations for high-speed ICE trains: Frankfurt Central Station (Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof), Frankfurt South station (Frankfurt Südbahnhof) and Frankfurt Airport long-distance station (Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof). Frankfurt is the busiest junction operated by Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, with 342 daily trains to domestic and European destinations.[8]\n\nFrankfurt Trade Fair (Messe Frankfurt) is the third largest trade fair in the world with a total area of 578,000 square metres (6,221,540 square feet). It has ten halls with a total of 321,754 square metres (3,463,331 square feet) of exhibition space and 96,078 square metres (1,034,175 square feet) of outdoor area more available. Many large trade fairs are held in Frankfurt each year, notably the Frankfurt Motor Show (Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung - IAA), the world's largest motor show, the Frankfurt Book Fair (Frankfurter Buchmesse), the world's largest book fair, and Musikmesse, the world's largest music fair.\n\nFrankfurt is also home to many cultural and educational institutions including the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University and the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, many museums (e.g. Städel, Naturmuseum Senckenberg, Goethe House), and two major botanical gardens, the Palmengarten, which is Germany's largest, and the Botanical Garden of the Goethe University.\n\nA unique feature of Frankfurt is its significant number of skyscrapers in the city center which form the Frankfurt skyline. Frankfurt is one of only a few cities in the European Union that have such a skyline, the others being London, Milan, Moscow, Warsaw, Madrid, Rotterdam and La Défense in the outer Paris region. Because of the city's skyline, Germans sometimes refer to Frankfurt am Main as \"Mainhattan\".\n\nName[]\n\nFrankonovurd (in old high German) or Vadum Francorum (in Latin) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to Frankenfort during the Middle Ages and then to Franckfort and Franckfurth in the modern era. At the beginning of the 19th century the spelling of Frankfurt was widely established. The affix \"am Main\" has been used regularly since the 14th century.\n\nIn English, the city's full name of Frankfurt am Main translates to \"Frankfurt on the Main\" (pronounced like English mine or German mein). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: Furt) on the Main river. As a part of early Franconia, the inhabitants were the early Franks, thus the city's name reveals its legacy as being \"the ford of the Franks on the Main river\".[9]\n\nAmong English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, though Germans occasionally call it by its full name when it is necessary to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city called Frankfurt in the federated state of Brandenburg, Frankfurt (Oder) on the Polish border.\n\nThe common abbreviations for the city, which are primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are Frankfurt (Main), Frankfurt (M), Frankfurt a.M., Frankfurt/Main or Frankfurt/M. The common acronym for the city is Ffm or FFM.\n\nThe older English spelling of Frankfort is now rarely seen, except for some cities, mainly in the United States.\n\nHistory[]\n\nMain article: History of Frankfurt am Main\n\nIn the area of the Römer, Roman settlements were established, probably in the 1st century; some artifacts from that era are found even to this day. The city district Bonames has a name probably dating back to Roman times—it is thought to be derived from bona me(n)sa. Nida (Heddernheim) was also a Roman civitas capital.\n\nThe name of Frankfurt on Main is derived from the Franconofurd of the Germanic tribe of the Franks; Furt (cf. English ford) where the river was shallow enough to be crossed by wading. Alemanni and Franks lived there and by 794 Charlemagne presided over an imperial assembly and church synod, at which Franconofurd (-furt -vurd) was first mentioned.\n\nFrankfurt was one of the most important cities in the following Holy Roman Empire. From 855 the German kings and emperors were elected in Frankfurt and crowned in Aachen. From 1562 the kings/emperors were also crowned in Frankfurt, Maximilian II being the first. This tradition ended in 1792, when Franz II was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on Bastille Day, 14 July, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. The elections and coronations took place in St. Bartholomäus cathedral, known as the Kaiserdom (en: Emperor's Cathedral), or in its predecessors.\n\nThe Frankfurter Messe (Frankfurt Trade Fair) was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, Emperor Friedrich II granted an Imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the Empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. Book trade fairs have been held in Frankfurt since 1478.\n\nIn 1372 Frankfurt became a Reichsstadt (en: Imperial city), i.e. directly subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.\n\nFrankfurt managed to remain neutral during the Thirty Years' War, but suffered from the bubonic plague that was brought to the city by refugees. After the end of the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth.\n\nIn the Napoleonic Wars Frankfurt was occupied or bombarded several times by French troops. It nevertheless still remained a free city until the total collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806 it become part of the principality of Aschaffenburg under the Fürstprimas (Prince-Primate), Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg. This also meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the confederation of the Rhine. In 1810 Dalberg adopted the title of a Grand Duke of Frankfurt. Napoleon intended to make his adopted son Eugène de Beauharnais, already Prince de Venise (\"prince of Venice\", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813, when the military tide turned in favour of the Anglo-Prussian lead allies, which overturned the Napoleonic order of central Europe. Dalberg abdicated in favour of Eugène de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never did rule after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt being taken by the allies.\n\nAfter Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815, redrawing the map of Europe) dissolved the grand-duchy, and Frankfurt entered the newly founded German Confederation (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its Bundestag, the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding Habsburg Emperor of Austria was represented by an Austrian \"presidential envoy\".\n\nAfter the ill-fated revolution of 1848, Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament, which met in the Frankfurter Paulskirche (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. The institution failed in 1849 when the Prussian king declared that he would not accept \"a crown from the gutter\". In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch.\n\nFrankfurt lost its independence after the Austro-Prussian War as Prussia in 1866 annexed several smaller states, among them the Free City of Frankfurt. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of Hesse-Nassau. The formerly independent towns of Bornheim and Bockenheim were incorporated in 1890.\n\nIn 1914 the citizens of Frankfurt founded the University of Frankfurt, later called Johann Wolfgang Goethe University. This is the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest universities.\n\nFrom 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the Ruhr Uprising, Frankfurt was occupied by French troops.[10] The French claimed that Articles 42 to 44 of the peace treaty of Versailles concerning the demilitarisation of the Rhineland had been broken.[11] In 1924 Ludwig Landmann became the first Jewish Mayor of the city, and led a significant expansion during the following years. However, during the Nazi era, the synagogues of Frankfurt were destroyed.\n\nThe city of Frankfurt was severely bombed in World War II (1939–1945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once famous medieval city centre, by that time the largest in Germany, was destroyed. Post-war reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus irrevocably changing the architectural face of Frankfurt. Only very few landmark buildings have been reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner. The collection of historically significant Cairo Genizah documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed when the city was bombed. According to Arabist and Genizah scholar S.D. Goitein, \"not even handlists indicating its contents have survived.\"[12]\n\nFrankfurt became a ground battlefield commencing 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The US 5th Infantry Division and US 6th Armored Division captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945. More details of this battle are provided at History of Frankfurt am Main.[13]\n\nAfter the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old Hesse-(Darmstadt) and the Prussian Hesse provinces. The city was part of the American Zone of Occupation of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945–1949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949–1952) had their headquarters in the IG Farben Building, intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment. Frankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital of West Germany—they even went as far as constructing a new parliament building that has never been used for its intended purpose. Since 1949 it is used to house the radio studios of Hessischer Rundfunk. In the end, Konrad Adenauer (the first post-war Chancellor) preferred the tiny city of Bonn, for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also for another reason; many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt, one of the largest German cities and a former centre of the old German-dominated Holy Roman Empire, would be accepted as a \"permanent\" capital of Germany, thereby weakening the West German population's support for reunification and the eventual return of the Government to Berlin.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems. That system includes a suburban rail system (S-Bahn) capable of reaching outlying communities as well as the city centre, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches (U-Bahn) also capable of travelling above ground on street rails.\n\nSince the postwar period Frankfurt has emerged once again as the financial and transportation centre of Germany.\n\nGeography[]\n\nGeographic location[]\n\nFrankfurt is located on both sides of the Main river south-east of the Taunus mountain range. It is the largest city in the federated state of Hesse in the south-western part of Germany. The southern part of the city contains the Frankfurt City Forest, Germany's largest forest within a city. The city area is 248.31 km2 (95.87 sq mi) and extends over 23.4 km (14.54 mi) in east-west-direction and 23.3 km (14.48 mi) in north-south-direction. The city centre of Frankfurt is located on the north side of the Main river in the city district of Altstadt (the historical centre) and the surrounding Innenstadt district. The geographical centre is located in the city district of Bockenheim near Frankfurt West station.\n\nFrankfurt is the centre of the densely populated Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region with a population of 5.6 million. Other important cities in the region are Wiesbaden (the capital of Hesse), Mainz (the capital of Rhineland-Palatinate), Darmstadt, Offenbach am Main, Hanau, Aschaffenburg, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe and Rüsselsheim.\n\nClimate[]\n\nFrankfurt has a temperate-oceanic climate with relatively cold winters and warm summers. Its average annual temperature is 10.6 °C (51.1 °F), with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) in January to 20.0 °C (68.0 °F) in July.\n\nClimate data for Frankfurt Airport, Germany for 1981–2010 (Source: DWD) Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 15.3\n\n(59.5) 17.5\n\n(63.5) 24.2\n\n(75.6) 28.3\n\n(82.9) 32.0\n\n(89.6) 37.5\n\n(99.5) 36.8\n\n(98.2) 38.7\n\n(101.7) 31.6\n\n(88.9) 28.0\n\n(82.4) 18.9\n\n(66.0) 16.3\n\n(61.3) 38.7\n\n(101.7) Average high °C (°F) 4.2\n\n(39.6) 5.9\n\n(42.6) 10.7\n\n(51.3) 15.4\n\n(59.7) 20.0\n\n(68.0) 23.1\n\n(73.6) 25.5\n\n(77.9) 25.1\n\n(77.2) 20.3\n\n(68.5) 14.6\n\n(58.3) 8.4\n\n(47.1) 4.9\n\n(40.8) 14.8\n\n(58.6) Daily mean °C (°F) 1.6\n\n(34.9) 2.4\n\n(36.3) 6.4\n\n(43.5) 10.3\n\n(50.5) 14.7\n\n(58.5) 17.8\n\n(64.0) 20.0\n\n(68.0) 19.5\n\n(67.1) 15.2\n\n(59.4) 10.4\n\n(50.7) 5.6\n\n(42.1) 2.5\n\n(36.5) 10.6\n\n(51.1) Average low °C (°F) −1.1\n\n(30.0) −1.1\n\n(30.0) 2.1\n\n(35.8) 4.9\n\n(40.8) 9.1\n\n(48.4) 12.3\n\n(54.1) 14.4\n\n(57.9) 14.0\n\n(57.2) 10.5\n\n(50.9) 6.6\n\n(43.9) 2.8\n\n(37.0) −0.1\n\n(31.8) 6.2\n\n(43.2) Record low °C (°F) −19.1\n\n(−2.4) −18.5\n\n(−1.3) −12.7\n\n(9.1) −7.1\n\n(19.2) −1.2\n\n(29.8) 3.6\n\n(38.5) 2.8\n\n(37.0) 5.0\n\n(41.0) 0.4\n\n(32.7) −4.3\n\n(24.3) −9\n\n(15.8) −16.9\n\n(1.6) −19.1\n\n(−2.4) Precipitation mm (inches) 44.5\n\n(1.752) 40.9\n\n(1.61) 48.4\n\n(1.906) 42.1\n\n(1.657) 63.4\n\n(2.496) 58.1\n\n(2.287) 64.7\n\n(2.547) 56.5\n\n(2.224) 53.0\n\n(2.087) 54.7\n\n(2.154) 49.1\n\n(1.933) 53.9\n\n(2.122) 629.18\n\n(24.7709) Mean monthly sunshine hours 31.1 67.2 115.3 164.1 204.5 202.7 220.8 201.3 152.0 92.8 36.4 27.0 1,515.3 Source: Data derived from Deutscher Wetterdienst[14]\n\nNeighboring districts and cities[]\n\nTo the west, Frankfurt borders the administrative district (Landkreis) of Main-Taunus-Kreis with cities such as Hattersheim am Main, Kriftel, Hofheim am Taunus, Kelkheim (Taunus), Liederbach am Taunus, Sulzbach (Taunus), Schwalbach am Taunus and Eschborn; to the northwest the Hochtaunuskreis with Steinbach (Taunus), Oberursel (Taunus) and Bad Homburg vor der Höhe; to the north the Wetteraukreis with Karben and Bad Vilbel; to the northeast the Main-Kinzig-Kreis with Niederdorfelden and Maintal; to the southeast the city of Offenbach am Main; to the south the Kreis Offenbach with Neu-Isenburg and to the southwest the Kreis Groß-Gerau with Mörfelden-Walldorf, Rüsselsheim and Kelsterbach.\n\nTogether with these cities (and some larger nearby cities, e.g. Hanau, Rodgau, Dreieich, Langen) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called Stadtregion Frankfurt which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3 million in 2010 and is therefore the 13th largest urban area of the European Union.\n\nDemographics[]\n\nPopulation[]\n\nWith a population of 688,249 in 2010, Frankfurt is the fifth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne. The city is considered a multicultural city because it is home to people of 180 nationalities. In addition to the ethnic German majority, the city contains sizable immigrant populations from Turkey, Italy, Colombia, Croatia, Serbia, Poland, Greece, Macedonia, Mexico, Morocco, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pakistan, Spain, Portugal, France, Netherlands, Japan, the United States, Austria, India, the United Kingdom, Romania, Afghanistan, Russia, Bulgaria, Lebanon, and China. The Frankfurt urban area is also home to the second-largest Korean community in Europe, and to Germany's largest Sri Lankan Tamil community. Nearly 25 percent of Frankfurt's residents are foreign nationals. In addition, 40 percent of Frankfurt's residents, and 65 percent of those below the age of five, come from an immigrant background.[15]\n\nFrankfurt has been a Großstadt (a city with at least 100,000 residents by definition) since 1875. With 414,576 residents in 1910, it was the 9th largest city in Germany and the number of inhabitants grew to 553,464 before World War II. After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000. In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963. It dropped again to 592,411 in 1986 but has increased since then. According to the demographic forecast of the City of Frankfurt, the population will reach the 700,000 mark in 2012 and will further increase up to 725,000 in 2020.\n\nAncestry Number Germans 58.1% Other European 23% Turks 9% Asians 5% Africans 3% Other/Mixed 1.9%\n\nReligion[]\n\nFrankfurt was historically a Protestant-dominated city. However, during the 19th century an increasing number of Catholics moved there. In 2006, Catholicism was the largest religious denomination (25 percent) closely followed by Protestantism (23 percent).[16] According to the Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland (Central Council of Jews in Germany) there are 7,300 Jews affiliated with Judaism in Frankfurt, giving it the third largest Jewish community (behind Berlin and Munich) in Germany.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nFrankfurt is one of five independent district-free cities (kreisfreie Städte) in Hesse which means that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. The other four cities are the second to fifth largest cities in Hesse: Wiesbaden, Kassel, Darmstadt and Offenbach am Main. A kreisfreie Stadt has territorial sovereignty within its defined city limits.\n\nSince 1995 Frankfurt's municipal leader has been Lord Mayor (Oberbürgermeisterin) Petra Roth of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). In 2012, Peter Feldmann (SPD) succeeded Roth as Lord Mayor. The CDU and the Alliance '90/The Greens (Bündnis '90/Die Grünen) currently form the governing parties in Frankfurt.\n\nInternational relations[]\n\nTwin towns and sister cities[]\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany\n\nFrankfurt twinned with, or has sister city relationships with:[17]\n\nLyon, France, since 1960[18]\n\nBirmingham, United Kingdom, since 1966\n\nMilan, Italy, since 1971[19]\n\nCairo, Egypt, since 1979\n\nTel Aviv, Israel, since 1980[20]\n\nGuangzhou, People's Republic of China, since 1988[21]\n\nToronto, Canada, since 1989\n\nPrague, Czech Republic, since 1990[22]\n\nBudapest, Hungary, since 1990[23]\n\nLeipzig since 1991[24]\n\nGranada, Nicaragua, since 1991\n\nAsmara, Eritrea, since 1991\n\nDubai, United Arab Emirates, since 2005\n\nGuadalajara, Mexico, since 2011\n\nYokohama, Japan, since 2011\n\nPartnerships[]\n\nPartnerships are a weaker form of cooperation than the sister city relationship, being more like a fixed-term cooperation or limited to certain projects. Frankfurt has partnerships with the following cities:\n\nDeuil-la-Barre, France, partnered with Nieder-Eschbach, since 1967; incorporated in 1972\n\nKraków, Poland, since 1991[25]\n\nSubdivisions[]\n\nThe city is divided into 46 city districts (Stadtteile), which are again divided into 118 city boroughs (Stadtbezirke) and 448 electoral districts (Wahlbezirke). The 46 city districts are combined for political reasons into 16 area districts (Ortsbezirke), which each have a district committee and chairperson.\n\nThe largest city district by population and area is Sachsenhausen, the smallest is Altstadt, Frankfurt's historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, Westend and Nordend) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern (-Nord) and a southern (-Süd) part, respectively a western (-West) and an eastern (-Ost) part, but are generally considered as one city district (that's why there are often only 43 city districts mentioned, even on the official website of the City of Frankfurt).[26]\n\nSome larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of Niederursel, Heddernheim and Praunheim), Goldstein (part of Schwanheim), Riedberg (part of Kalbach-Riedberg) and Europaviertel (part of Gallus). The Bankenviertel (banking district), Frankfurt's financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western Innenstadt district, the southern Westend district and the eastern Bankenviertel district).\n\nMany city districts are incorporated suburbs (Vororte), or were previously independent cities, like Höchst. Some like Nordend and Westend arose during the rapid growth of the city in the Gründerzeit following the Unification of Germany, while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city district, like Dornbusch and Riederwald.\n\nPopulation by districts[]\n\nPopulation of the 46 city districts on 31 December 2009 No\n\nCity district (Stadtteil)\n\nArea in km²[27]\n\nPopulation[28]\n\nForeign nationals[28]\n\nForeign nationals in %[28]\n\nArea district (Ortsbezirk)\n\n01 Altstadt 00051 !0,51 km² 3.475 1.122 323 !32,3% 01 - Innenstadt 1 02 Innenstadt 00152 !1,52 km² 6.577 2.529 385 !38,5% 01 - Innenstadt 1 03 Bahnhofsviertel 00053 !0,53 km² 2.125 810 381 !38,1% 01 - Innenstadt 1 04 Westend-Süd 00247 !2,47 km² 17.288 3.445 199 !19,9% 02 - Innenstadt 2 05 Westend-Nord 00167 !1,67 km² 8.854 2.184 247 !24,7% 02 - Innenstadt 2 06 Nordend-West 00307 !3,07 km² 28.808 5.162 179 !17,9% 03 - Innenstadt 3 07 Nordend-Ost 00169 !1,69 km² 26.619 5.580 210 !21,0% 03 - Innenstadt 3 08 Ostend 00540 !5,40 km² 26.955 7.213 268 !26,8% 04 - Innenstadt 4 09 Bornheim 00266 !2,66 km² 27.184 6.240 230 !23,0% 04 - Innenstadt 4 10 Gutleutviertel 00220 !2,20 km² 5.843 1.953 334 !33,4% 01 - Innenstadt 1 11 Gallus 00422 !4,22 km² 26.716 11.012 412 !41,2% 01 - Innenstadt 1 12 Bockenheim 00804 !8,04 km² 34.740 9.034 260 !26,0% 02 - Innenstadt 2 13 Sachsenhausen-Nord 00424 !4,24 km² 30.374 6.507 214 !21,4% 05 - Süd 14 Sachsenhausen-Süd 03491 !34,91 km² 26.114 4.847 186 !18,6% 05 - Süd 15 Flughafen 02000 !20,00 km² 211 14 066 !6,6% 05 - Süd 16 Oberrad 00274 !2,74 km² 12.828 3.113 243 !24,3% 05 - Süd 17 Niederrad 00293 !2,93 km² 22.954 6.569 286 !28,6% 05 - Süd 18 Schwanheim 01773 !17,73 km² 20.162 3.532 175 !17,5% 06 - West 19 Griesheim 00490 !4,90 km² 22.648 8.029 355 !35,5% 06 - West 20 Rödelheim 00515 !5,15 km² 17.841 4.863 273 !27,3% 07 - Mitte-West 21 Hausen 00126 !1,26 km² 7.178 2.135 297 !29,7% 07 - Mitte-West 22/23 Praunheim 00455 !4,55 km² 15.761 3.197 203 !20,3% 07 - Mitte-West 24 Heddernheim 00249 !2,49 km² 16.443 3.194 194 !19,4% 08 - Nord-West 25 Niederursel 00722 !7,22 km² 16.394 3.671 224 !22,4% 08 - Nord-West 26 Ginnheim 00273 !2,73 km² 16.444 4.024 245 !24,5% 09 - Mitte-Nord 27 Dornbusch 00238 !2,38 km² 18.511 3.482 188 !18,8% 09 - Mitte-Nord 28 Eschersheim 00334 !3,34 km² 14.808 2.657 179 !17,9% 09 - Mitte-Nord 29 Eckenheim 00223 !2,23 km² 14.277 3.674 257 !25,7% 10 - Nord-Ost 30 Preungesheim 00374 !3,74 km² 13.568 3.442 254 !25,4% 10 - Nord-Ost 31 Bonames 00124 !1,24 km² 6.362 1.288 202 !20,2% 10 - Nord-Ost 32 Berkersheim 00318 !3,18 km² 3.400 592 174 !17,4% 10 - Nord-Ost 33 Riederwald 00104 !1,04 km² 4.911 1.142 233 !23,3% 11 - Ost 34 Seckbach 00804 !8,04 km² 10.194 1.969 193 !19,3% 11 - Ost 35 Fechenheim 00718 !7,18 km² 16.061 5.635 351 !35,1% 11 - Ost 36 Höchst 00473 !4,73 km² 13.888 5.279 380 !38,0% 06 - West 37 Nied 00382 !3,82 km² 17.829 5.224 293 !29,3% 06 - West 38 Sindlingen 00398 !3,98 km² 9.032 2.076 230 !23,0% 06 - West 39 Zeilsheim 00547 !5,47 km² 11.984 2.555 213 !21,3% 06 - West 40 Unterliederbach 00585 !5,85 km² 14.350 3.511 245 !24,5% 06 - West 41 Sossenheim 00597 !5,97 km² 15.853 4.235 267 !26,7% 06 - West 42 Nieder-Erlenbach 00834 !8,34 km² 4.629 496 107 !10,7% 13 - Nieder-Erlenbach 43 Kalbach-Riedberg 00690 !6,90 km² 8.482 1.279 151 !15,1% 12 - Kalbach-Riedberg 44 Harheim 00502 !5,02 km² 4.294 446 104 !10,4% 14 - Harheim 45 Nieder-Eschbach 00635 !6,35 km² 11.499 1.978 172 !17,2% 15 - Nieder-Eschbach 46 Bergen-Enkheim 01254 !12,54 km² 17.954 2.764 154 !15,4% 16 - Bergen-Enkheim 47 Frankfurter Berg 00216 !2,16 km² 7.149 1.715 240 !24,0% 10 - Nord-Ost Frankfurt am Main 24833 !248,33 km² 679.571 165.418 243 !24,3%\n\nHistory of incorporations[]\n\nUntil the year 1877, the city territory of Frankfurt consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of Altstadt, Innenstadt, Bahnhofsviertel, Gutleutviertel, Gallus, Westend, Nordend, Ostend and Sachsenhausen.\n\nBornheim, which was part of an administrative district called Landkreis Frankfurt, became part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by Bockenheim on 1 April 1895. Seckbach, Niederrad and Oberrad followed on 1 July 1900. The Landkreis Frankfurt was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore Berkersheim, Bonames, Eckenheim, Eschersheim, Ginnheim, Hausen, Heddernheim, Niederursel, Praunheim, Preungesheim and Rödelheim joined the City of Frankfurt. In the same year a new city district, Riederwald, was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.\n\nOn 1 April 1928, the City of Höchst became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts Sindlingen, Unterliederbach and Zeilsheim. Simultaneously the Landkreis Höchst was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt (Fechenheim, Griesheim, Nied, Schwanheim, Sossenheim) or joining the newly established Landkreis of Main-Taunus-Kreis.\n\nDornbusch became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, the government of Hesse developed plans to significantly reduce the number of administrative districts in Hesse (Hessische Gebietsreform). On 1 August 1972, the smaller suburbs of Harheim, Kalbach, Nieder-Erlenbach, and Nieder-Eschbach became districts of Frankfurt while other neighbouring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the Landkreis Offenbach, the Kreis Groß-Gerau, the Hochtaunuskreis, the Main-Kinzig-Kreis or the Wetteraukreis.\n\nBergen-Enkheim was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.\n\nFlughafen became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport which had formerly belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighbouring city of Mörfelden-Walldorf.\n\nFrankfurt's youngest city district is Frankfurter Berg. It was part of Bonames until 1996.\n\nKalbach was officially renamed \"Kalbach-Riedberg\" in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area which goes by the name of Riedberg.\n\nCityscape[]\n\nLandmarks[]\n\nSaint Bartholomew's Cathedral\n\nSaint Bartholomew's Cathedral (Dom Sankt Bartholomäus), named after Bartholomew the Apostle, is a gothic building which was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the Merovingian time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the Holy Roman Empire were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, the Roman-German emperors were crowned here. Today, it is the main church of Frankfurt.\n\nSince the 18th century, St. Bartholomew's has been called \"the cathedral\" by the people, although it has never been a bishop's seat. In 1867, the cathedral was destroyed by a fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in World War II and rebuilt in the 1950s. The height of the cathedral is 95 metres. The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of 66 metres.\n\nSaint Paul's Church\n\nSaint Paul's Church (Paulskirche) is a national historic monument in Germany with great political symbolism, because it was the seat of the first democratically elected Parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a Protestant church but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its root in the Frankfurt Parliament, which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of Prussia and Austria did not want to lose power, and in 1849, Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force of arms and the parliament was dissolved. Afterwards, the building was used for church services again.\n\nSt. Paul's was partially destroyed in World War II, particularly the interior of the building, which now has a modern appearance. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war; today it is not used for religious services, but mainly for exhibitions and events.\n\nArchäologischer Garten Frankfurt\n\nThe Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest buildings ever recovered in Frankfurt: An ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace (Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt) from the 6th century. The garden is located between the Römerberg and St. Bartholomew's. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. There are plans underway to construct a building on top of the garden but anyhow it is decided that the garden will stay open to the public.\n\nRömer\n\n\"Römer\" is the German word for \"Roman\" and is the name of a complex of nine houses that form the Frankfurt city hall (Rathaus). The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with the neighbouring buildings. Located on the upper floor is the Kaisersaal (\"Emperor's Hall\") where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The Römer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the Römerberg, is named after the city hall.\n\nHaus Wertheim\n\nWertheim House is the only timbered house in the Altstadt district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II without any damage. It is located on the Römerberg next to the Historical Museum.\n\nSaalhof\n\nThe Saalhof is the oldest conserved building in the Altstadt district which dates back to the 12th century. It was used as an exhibition hall by Dutch clothiers when trade fairs were held in Frankfurt during the 14th and 15th century. The Saalhof was partly destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. Today it serves as a part of the Historical Museum.\n\nEiserner Steg\n\nThe Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge over the Main river which connects the Römerberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was only the second bridge to cross the river in Frankfurt. After World War II, when it was blown up by the Wehrmacht, it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today around 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.\n\nAlte Oper\n\nThe Alte Oper is a former opera house, hence the name \"Old Opera\". It was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed \"Germany's Most Beautiful Ruin\". There were even efforts to just blow it up. Former Frankfurt Lord Mayor Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname \"Dynamite-Rudi\". (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.)\n\nDue to public pressure, it was finally fully reconstructed and reopened in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the \"new\" Oper Frankfurt. The inscription on the frieze of the Alte Oper says: \"Dem Wahren, Schönen, Guten\" (\"To the true, the beautiful, the good\").\n\nEschenheimer Turm\n\nThe Eschenheim Tower (Eschenheimer Turm) was erected at the beginning of the 15th century and served as a city gate as part of the late-medieval fortifications of Frankfurt. It is the oldest and most unaltered building in the Innenstadt district.\n\nSaint Catherine's Church\n\nSt. Catherine's Church (Katharinenkirche) is the largest evangelical church in Frankfurt, dedicated to the martyred early Christian saint, Catherine of Alexandria. It is located in the city centre at the entrance to the Zeil, the central shopping street.\n\nHauptwache\n\nAlthough today \"Hauptwache\" is mostly associated with the inner-city underground train station of the same name, the name originates from a baroque building on the square above the station. The Hauptwache building was constructed in 1730 and was used as a prison, therefore the name that translates as \"main guard-house\". Today the square surrounding the building is also called \"Hauptwache\" (formal: An der Hauptwache). It is situated in the city centre opposite to St. Catherine's Church and houses a famous café.\n\nFrankfurt Central Station\n\nFrankfurt Central Station (Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof), which opened in 1888, was built as the central train station for Frankfurt to replace three smaller train stations in the city centre and to boost the needed capacity for travellers. It was constructed as a terminus station and was the largest train station in Europe by floor area until 1915 when Leipzig Central Station was opened. Its three main halls were constructed in a neorenaissance-style, while the later enlargement with two outer halls in 1924 were constructed in a neoclassicism-style.\n\nFrankfurter Hof\n\nThe Frankfurter Hof is a landmarked hotel in the city centre at Kaiserplatz, built from 1872-1876. It is part of Steigenberger Hotels group and is considered the most prestigious hotel in Frankfurt.\n\n20th-century architecture[]\n\nFrauenfriedenskirche and Holy Cross Church, both consecrated 1929, an example of an early modernist church building.\n\nGrossmarkthalle, built 1926–1928, the former wholesale market hall, currently under reconstruction to become part of the future European Central Bank Headquarters.\n\nGoethe House, rebuilt 1947. The birthplace of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe from 1749 was destroyed in World War II and then rebuilt true to the original.\n\nJunior-Haus, built 1951, an example of early post-World War II architecture located at Kaiserplatz.\n\nBayer-Haus, built 1952, another example of early post-World War II architecture. Today it houses the 5-star Fleming's Hotel Frankfurt.\n\nMuseum für angewandte Kunst, built 1985, designed by Richard Meier.\n\nIG Farben Building\n\nThe IG Farben Building, also known as Poelzig Building (Poelzig-Bau) after its architect Hans Poelzig, was built from 1928 to 1930 as the corporate headquarters of the chemical industry conglomerate I.G. Farbenindustrie AG. It is located in the Westend district and borders Grüneburgpark in the west. On its completion, the complex was the largest office building in Europe and remained so until the 1950s. The building served as headquarters for research projects relating to the development of Nazi wartime synthetic oil and rubber, and the production administration of magnesium, lubricating oil, explosives, methanol, and Zyklon B, the lethal gas used in concentration camps.[29][30] After World War II, the IG Farben Building served as the headquarters for the Supreme Allied Command and from 1949-1952 the High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG). It became the principal location for implementing the Marshall Plan, which largely financed the post-war reconstruction of Europe. The state apparatus of the Federal German Government was devised there. The IG Farben Building served as the headquarters for the US Army's V Corps and the Northern Area Command (NACOM) until 1995 when the US Army returned control of the IG Farben Building to the German government. It was purchased on behalf of the Goethe University Frankfurt by the state of Hesse. Since October 2001 it is part of the Westend Campus of the Goethe University.\n\n21st-century architecture[]\n\nDie Welle (The Wave), built 1998–2003, a complex of three wavelike-formed office buildings next to the Opernplatz.\n\nAlte Stadtbibliothek, rebuilt 2003–2005, reconstruction of the old public library house which was originally built 1820–1825.\n\nPalais Thurn und Taxis, rebuilt 2004–2009, reconstruction of a palace which was originally built 1731–1739.\n\nMyZeil, built 2004-–2009, a shopping mall at the Zeil with an imposing vaulted glass-structure.\n\nThe Squaire\n\nThe Squaire (a portmanteau of the words square and air), also known as Airrail Center Frankfurt, is a 660 m (2,165.35 ft) long and 45 m (147.64 ft) tall office building located at Frankfurt Airport. It was built from 2006–2011 on top of an existing railway station (Frankfurt Airport long distance Station) and has a connecting bridge to Terminal 1 for pedestrians. With a total of 140,000 m² rentable floor space it is considered the largest office building in Germany. Main tenants of the Squaire are KPMG Europe LLP, two Hilton Hotels and Lufthansa.\n\nSkyscrapers[]\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt am Main\n\nFrankfurt is one of the few European cities with a significant number of skyscrapers, meaning buildings at least 150 m (492.13 ft) tall. Twelve out of a total of 13 skyscrapers in Germany are located in Frankfurt with two more (European Central Bank Headquarters, 185 metres, and Taunusturm, 170 metres) under construction in 2011. Most of the skyscrapers and high-rise office buildings in Frankfurt are located in the financial district (Bankenviertel) near the city centre, around the trade fair premises (Europaviertel) and at Mainzer Landstraße, which connects the two areas.\n\nThe 12 skyscrapers in Frankfurt are:\n\nCommerzbank Tower, 259 m (849.74 ft) — Europe's tallest building (1997–2003), Headquarters of Commerzbank.\n\nMesseturm, 257 m (843.18 ft) — Europe's tallest building (1990–1997), Main tenant is Goldman Sachs (Germany).\n\nWestend Tower, 208 m (682.41 ft) — Headquarters of DZ Bank.\n\nMain Tower, 200 m (656.17 ft) — Headquarters of Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen and of Standard & Poor’s (Germany).\n\nTower 185, 200 m (656.17 ft) — Headquarters of PricewaterhouseCoopers (Germany).\n\nTrianon, 186 m (610.24 ft) — Headquarters of DekaBank.\n\nOpernturm, 170 m (557.74 ft) — Headquarters of UBS (Germany).\n\nSilberturm, 166 m (544.62 ft) — Germany's tallest building (1978–1990), Main tenant is Deutsche Bahn.\n\nWestend Gate, 159 m (521.65 ft) — Germany's tallest building (1976–1978), Main tenant is Marriott Frankfurt Hotel.\n\nDeutsche Bank I, 155 m (508.53 ft) — Headquarters of Deutsche Bank.\n\nDeutsche Bank II, 155 m (508.53 ft) — Headquarters of Deutsche Bank.\n\nSkyper, 154 m (505.25 ft) — Main tenant is DekaBank.\n\nOther high-rise buildings in Frankfurt include:\n\nEurotower, 148 m (485.56 ft) — Headquarters of European Central Bank.\n\nFrankfurter Büro Center, 142 m (465.88 ft) — Main tenant is Clifford Chance (Germany).\n\nCity-Haus, 142 m (465.88 ft) — Main tenant is DZ Bank.\n\nGallileo, 136 m (446.19 ft) — Main tenant is Commerzbank.\n\nHistory of high-rise buildings[]\n\nFor centuries, St. Bartholomeus's Cathedral had been the highest structure in Frankfurt. The first building to beat the 95-metres high cathedral in terms of height was not an office building but a grain silo, the 120-metres high Henninger Turm, built from 1959-1961.\n\nThe first boom of high-rise buildings came in the 1970s when the Silberturm and the Westend Gate (then called Plaza Büro Center) were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 166 metres and 159 metres respectively. Around the same time, the Frankfurter Büro Center and the City-Haus (both 142 metres tall) were constructed at Mainzer Landstraße and the Eurotower (148 metres) and the Garden Tower (127 metres; then called Helaba-Hochhaus) were constructed in the financial district.\n\nDuring the 1980s, none of the then constructed buildings reached higher than the existing buildings. The most famous buildings from this decade are the Deutsche Bank Twin Towers at Taunusanlage, both 155 metres tall.\n\nThe second boom of high-rise buildings was in the 1990s: The Messeturm, built at the trade fair premises, reached a height of 257 metres and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was beaten in terms of height by the Commerzbank Tower (259 metres) in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are Westend Tower (208 metres), Main Tower (200 metres) and Trianon (186 metres).\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, Frankfurt has seen the construction of more high-rise buildings (e.g. Skyper, Gallileo, Westhafen Tower) but not any record-breaking heights. The last skyscrapers constructed were the Opernturm (170 metres; built 2007-2010) and the Tower 185 (200 metres; built 2008-2011).\n\nOther tall structures[]\n\nEuropaturm\n\nThe Europe Tower is a telecommunications tower, also known as the Frankfurt TV Tower, built from 1974-1979. With a height of 337.5 metres it is the tallest tower in the city and the second tallest structure in Germany after the Fernsehturm Berlin. It was open to the public until 1999, with an entertainment establishment in the revolving top. It is normally referred to by locals as the \"Ginnheimer Spargel\" (Ginnheim Asparagus), which is misleading because it is not located in the Ginnheim district but stands a few metres within the neighbouring Bockenheim district.\n\nHenninger Turm\n\nThe Henninger Tower is a 120-metre high grain silo built from 1959–1961 and owned by Henninger Brewery. It was the highest structure in Frankfurt until 1974 and it was the first to surpass the 95-metre high St. Bartholomeus Cathedral. The Henninger Tower has two rotating restaurants at the height of 101 and 106 metres and an open-air observation deck at the height of 110 metres. The tower has been closed to the public since October 2002. Plans to destroy the tower and replace it were abandoned because of its statuts as a local landmark building. Today there are new plans to convert it into a residential tower but these plans are also criticized because it would drastically change the external appearance of the tower. From 1962 to 2008 there was a famous yearly cycling race named after the tower, the \"Radrennen Rund um den Henninger Turm\" (Cycling race around Henninger Tower). The race is still a yearly event but due to a change of sponsors it has now a different name, while locals still call it by its long-established name.\n\nGoetheturm\n\nThe Goethe Tower is a 43-metre high tower built entirely out of wood on the northern edge of the Frankfurt City Forest in Sachsenhausen. It is the fifth tallest wooden construction in Germany. It was built in 1931 and is still a popular place for day-trippers, especially families, as a large playground and a café have been built at the foot of the tower. Climbing the Goethe Tower is free of charge and offers a spectacular view of the Frankfurt skyline. Due to deficiencies on the wooden structure, the tower is temporarily closed (Summer 2011).\n\nShopping streets[]\n\nZeil\n\nThe Zeil is Frankfurt's central shopping street and one of the most crowded in Germany. The street is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by two large public squares, Hauptwache in the west and Konstablerwache in the east. It is the second most expensive street for shops to rent in Germany after the Kaufingerstraße in Munich. 85 percent of the shops there are retail store chains like H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. In 2009 a new shopping mall named MyZeil opened on the Zeil with nearly 100 stores and new chains like Hollister. There are three more shopping malls on the Zeil: Zeilgalerie, Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt, as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek & Cloppenburg and C&A. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to one of the largest and oldest Christmas Markets in Germany.\n\nGoethestraße\n\nGoethestraße is Frankfurt's most expensive shopping street with prestigious shops like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci, Tiffany, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Cartier, Burberry, Vertu and Bulgari. It is located between the financial district and the city centre and runs from Goetheplatz to Opernplatz.\n\nFreßgass\n\n\"Freßgass\" (officially Kalbächer Gasse and Große Bockenheimer Straße) is the well-established name for a pedestrian-only street section between Börsenstraße and Opernplatz in the city centre. The name literally translates as \"devour alley\" because of its high concentration of gastronomy, but latetly more and more prestigious shops (e.g. Apple Store, Hugo Boss, Porsche Design) move here, due to a lack of space in the neighbouring Goethestraße, and displace old-established restaurants, butchers or delicatessen.\n\nBerger Straße\n\nBerger Straße is Frankfurt's longest shopping street. It begins in the city center, runs through Nordend and Bornheim and ends in Seckbach. The street is less crowded than the Zeil and offers more smaller shops, restaurants and cafés.\n\nBraubachstraße\n\nBrauchbachstraße in the Altstadt district, close to the historic sites of the city, offers a large variety of art galleries and second-hand bookshops.\n\nMünchener Straße\n\nMünchener Straße in the Bahnhofsviertel district, located between the central station and Willy-Brandt-Platz, is the most multicultural shopping street in Frankfurt with lots of shops that sell product mainly from Turkey, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nKaiserstraße\n\nKaiserstraße is one of the best-known streets in Frankfurt and considered one of the most beautiful because of its amount of Gründerzeit-style buildings. It runs parallel to Münchener Straße from the central station to the financial district.

The part between the northern Main riverbank and the Opernplatz, referred to officially as Taunusanlage and Gallusanlage, is also locally known as \"Central Park\" (a reference to the famous park in Manhattan), not because of its size but because of the skyscrapers which stand on both sides of the park.\n\nNizza Park\n\nAt the juncture of the northern Main riverbank and the Wallanlagen is a famous small park called Nizza. The name of the park recalls the City of Nice in southern France because it is one of the warmest areas in Frankfurt with a nearly mediterranean climate.

It was here, in the early 1990s, that local DJs like Sven Väth and DJ DAG (of Dance 2 Trance) first played a harder, deeper style of acid house that became hugely popular worldwide during the next decade. One of the main venues of the early Trance music sound was the Omen nightclub in the city (closed 1998). Another very popular disco club of the 1980-1990s and one of Frankfurt's hotspots for Techno/Trance music was the Dorian Gray which was located within Terminal 1 at Frankfurt Airport. Because of the location at the airport the club had no restrictions regarding the opening hours. The club had to close at the end of the year 2000 because it was not longer possible to meet strict fire safety regulations.

Apfelwein is also available in a stoneware jar locally known as \"Bembel\". A group of people normally orders a \"Bembel\" (or two) and shares the content. Apfelwein can be ordered as \"sauergespritzer\", which is apfelwein blended with 30% mineral water or as \"süssgespritzer\", which is Apfelwein blended with lemon soda, orange soda or fresh-pressed apple juice (lemon soda being the most common). Most of the old-established pubs which serve Apfelwein are located in Sachsenhausen, which is therefore jocularly known as \"Ebbelwoi district\".

The Frankfurter Kreuz is an Autobahn interchange close to the airport, where the Bundesautobahn 3 (A3), Cologne to Würzburg, and the Bundesautobahn 5 (A5), Basel to Hannover, meet. With approximately 320,000 cars passing through it every day it is the most heavily-used interchange in Europe. The Bundesautobahn 66 (A66) connects Frankfurt with Wiesbaden in the west and Fulda in the east. The Bundesautobahn 661 (A661) is mainly a commuter motorway which starts in the south (Egelsbach), runs through the eastern part of Frankfurt and ends in the north (Oberursel). The Bundesautobahn 648 (A648) is a very short motorway in the western part of Frankfurt which primarily serves as a fast connection between the A 66 and the Frankfurt Trade Fair. The A5 in the west, the A3 in the south and the A661 in the north-east form a ring road around the inner city districts of Frankfurt and define a Low-emission zone (Umweltzone; established in 2008), meaning that vehicles have to meet certain emission criteria otherwise they are not allowed to enter the zone.\n\nThe streets of central Frankfurt are usually congested with cars during rush hour. Some areas, especially around the shopping streets Zeil, Goethestraße and Freßgass, are pedestrian-only streets, but there are numerous car parks located throughout the city and especially in the city centre.\n\nRailway stations[]\n\nFrankfurt Central Station\n\nFrankfurt Central Station (Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof, often abbreviated as Frankfurt (Main) Hbf or F-Hbf) is the largest railway station in Germany by railway traffic.

It is a stop for most of the ICE high speed lines, making it the most important station of Germany's ICE network. In addition, ICE Trains to London via the Channel Tunnel are planned for 2013.[34] All Rhine-Main S-Bahn lines, two U-Bahn lines (U4, U5), several tram and bus lines stop here, too. Regional and local trains are integrated in the Public transport system Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV), the second largest integrated public transport systems in the world. Only the integrated public transport system in Berlin (Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg) is larger.\n\nFrankfurt Airport stations\n\nFrankfurt Airport can be accessed by two railway stations: Frankfurt Airport long-distance station (Frankfurt Flughafen Fernbahnhof) is only for long-distance traffic and connects the airport to the main rail network, with most of the ICE services using the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line. The long-distance station is located outside the actual airport ground but has a connecting bridge for pedestrians to Terminal 1, concourse B. Frankfurt Airport regional station (Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof) is for local S-Bahn trains (lines S8, S9) and regional trains. The regional station is located within Terminal 1, concourse B.\n\nFrankfurt South station\n\nFrankfurt's third long-distance station is Frankfurt South station (Frankfurt Südbahnhof, often abbreviated as Frankfurt (Main) Süd or F-Süd), located in Sachsenhausen. It is also an important destination for local trains and trams (lines 14 to 16, 19) and the terminal stop for four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U8) and two S-Bahn lines (S5, S6).\n\nMesse stations\n\nThe Frankfurt Trade Fair offers two railway stations: Messe station is for local S-Bahn trains (lines S3-S6) and is located at the centre of the trade fair premises while Festhalle/Messe station is served by U-Bahn line U4 and is located at the north-east corner of the premises.\n\nKonstablerwache station and Hauptwache station\n\nTwo other major railway stations in the city centre are Konstablerwache and Hauptwache, located on both ends of the Zeil.

Konstablerwache station is the second-busiest railway station regarding daily passenger volume in Frankfurt (191,000) after the central station. The third-busiest railway station is Hauptwache station (181,000).\n\nPublic transport[]\n\nMain article: Public transport in Frankfurt am Main\n\nThe city has two underground railway systems: the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn, as well as an above-ground tram system. Information about the U- and S-Bahn can be found on the website of the RMV.[35]\n\nS-Bahn\n\nNine S-Bahn lines (S1 to S9) connect Frankfurt with the densely populated Rhine Main Region. Most routes have an at least 15 minute service during the day, either by one line running every 15 minutes, or by two lines servicing one route together with a 30 minutes schedule each. All lines, except line S7, run through the Frankfurt city tunnel and serve the stations Ostendstraße, Konstablerwache, Hauptwache, Taunusanlage and Frankfurt Central Station. When leaving the city the S-Bahn travels above ground. It provides access to the trade fair (S3, S4, S5, S6), the airport (S8, S9), the stadium (S7, S8, S9) and nearby cities such as Wiesbaden, Mainz, Darmstadt, Rüsselsheim, Hanau, Offenbach am Main, Oberursel, Bad Homburg, Kronberg, Friedberg and smaller towns that are on the way.\n\nU-Bahn\n\nThe U-Bahn has nine lines (U1 to U9) serving Frankfurt and the larger suburbs of Bad Homburg and Oberursel in the north. The trains which run on the line are in fact lightrails as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs with a 7.5–10 minute frequency which combines to approx 3–5 minutes on the city centre sections served by more than one line.\n\nTram\n\nFrankfurt has ten tram lines (11, 12, 14 to 21), with trams arriving usually every 10 minutes. Many sections are served by two lines, combining to give a 5 minute frequency during rush-hour. The tram runs only above ground and serve more stops than the U-Bahn or the S-Bahn.\n\nBus\n\nA number of bus lines complete the Frankfurt public transport system. Night buses take over the service of the U-Bahn and tram at 1:30 am to 3:30 am.[36] The central junction for the night bus service is Konstablerwache in the city centre, where all night bus lines start and end.\n\nTaxis[]\n\nTaxis can usually be found outside the major S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations, at the central station, the south station, the airport, the trade fair and in the crowded inner-city shopping streets. The common way to obtain a taxi is to either call a taxi operator or to go to a taxi rank. However, although not the norm, one can hail a passing taxi on the street.\n\nBicycles[]\n\nDeutsche Bahn not only operates the German railway network, but also makes bicycles available for hire. The bicycles are stationed all over the city, including at selected railway stations. They can easily be spotted because of their eye-catching silver-red colour. To hire a specific bike one has to call a service number to get a code for unlocking the bike lock. The costs for hiring a bike are €0.06 per minute or €15 per day. To return the bike you have to lock it again within a certain area and call the service number. For more information see \"Call a bike\".[1]\n\nVelotaxis are also available in Frankfurt. A velotaxi is a cycle rickshaw, a type of tricycle designed to carry passengers in addition to the driver. The advantage of a velotaxi is that it is allowed to drive in pedestrian-only areas and is therefore practical for a sightseeing tour in the city.\n\nFrankfurt has also a network of modern cycle routes throughout city. Many of the long distance bike routes into the city have cycle tracks that are separate from motorised vehicle traffic. A number of roads in the city centre are \"bicycle streets\" where the cyclist has the right of way and where motorised vehicles are only allowed access if they do not disrupt the cycle users. In addition, cyclists are allowed to ride many cramped one-way streets in both ways. This is a visible result of policy intentions to increase the number of cyclists in the city; today, 15 percent of Frankfurt's citizens use a bike and the number is expected to grow to 20 percent in the next years. For further information see [2].\n\nEconomy and business[]\n\nDue to its high concentration of important financial institutions, Frankfurt is one of the world's most important financial centres and the leading one in Germany, Munich coming some way behind. Frankfurt was ranked 7th at the International Financial Centers Development Index (2012), 8th at the Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index (2008), 10th at the Global Financial Centres Index (January 2013),[37] 10th at the Global Power City Index (2011), 11th at the Global City Competitiveness Index (2012), 12th at the Innovation Cities Index (2011),[38] 14th at the World City Survey (2011) and 23th at the Global Cities Index (2012).[39]\n\nAccording to an annual study by Cushman & Wakefield, the European Cities Monitor (2010), Frankfurt has been one of the top three cities for international companies in Europe, along with London and Paris, since the survey started in 1990.[40] It is also the only German city considered to be an alpha world city (category 3) as listed by the Loughborough University group's 2010 inventory,[41] which was a promotion from the group's 2008 inventory when it was ranked as an alpha minus world city (category 4).[42]\n\nCentral banks[]\n\nFrankfurt is home to two important central banks.\n\nEuropean Central Bank\n\nThe European Central Bank (Europäische Zentralbank) is one of the world's most important central banks. The ECB sets monetary policy for the Eurozone, consisting of 17 European Union member states that have adopted the Euro (€) as their common currency and sole legal tender. Since its foundation in 1998 the ECB Headquarters are located in the Eurotower at Willy-Brandt-Platz and, due to a shortage of space, in two other high-rise office buildings in Frankfurt's financial district. The future European Central Bank Headquarters in the Ostend district, consisting of the former wholesale market hall (Großmarkthalle) and a newly built 185-metres skyscraper, are expected to be completed by early 2014. The new building complex will house up to 2,300 ECB personnel. The location, which is a few miles away from the city centre and borders an industrial area as well as the Osthafen (East Harbour), was primarily chosen because of its large premises which allows the ECB to install safety arrangements without using high fences.\n\nThe City of Frankfurt honours the importance of the ECB by officially using the slogan \"The City of the Euro\" since 1998.\n\nGerman Federal Bank\n\nThe German Federal Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank), located in Bockenheim, was established in 1957 as the central bank for the Federal Republic of Germany. Until the euro (€) was physically introduced in 2002, the Deutsche Bundesbank was responsible for the monetary policy of Germany and for the German currency, the Deutsche Mark (DM). The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. Today the Bundesbank is an integral part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) which is formed by all 27 European Union member states.\n\nBanks[]\n\nIn 2010, 63 national and 152 international banks had a registered office in Frankfurt, including the headquarters of the major German banks, as well as 41 representative offices of international banks.[7] Frankfurt is therefore well known as Bankenstadt (\"City of the banks\") and nicknamed \"Mainhattan\" (a portmanteau of the local Main river and Manhattan in New York City) or \"Bankfurt\". 73,200 people were employed at banks in Frankfurt in 2010.\n\nDeutsche Bank\n\nDeutsche Bank is by far the largest commercial bank in Germany.

The Headquarters of Deutsche Bank are located at Taunusanlage in the financial district.\n\nCommerzbank\n\nCommerzbank is Germany's second-largest commercial bank with total assets of €754 billion (2010). In 2009, Commerzbank merged with competitor Dresdner Bank, then the third-largest German bank. Due to the merger and the higher credit risks, Commerzbank was partially nationalized (25 percent) during the financial crisis in 2009. It is listed in the DAX stock market index. The Headquarters of Commerzbank are at Commerzbank Tower (259 metres), the tallest building in the European Union, at Kaiserplatz in the financial district.\n\nKfW Bankengruppe\n\nKfW Banking Group is a government-owned development bank which was formed in 1948 as part of the Marshall Plan to rebuilt Germany after World War II. Today KfW provides loans for purposes prescribed by the KfW law at lower rates than commercial banks, especially to medium-sized businesses. With total assets of €442 billion (2010) it is Germany's third-largest bank. The KfW Headquarters are located in the Westend district at Bockenheimer Landstraße and Senckenberganlage.\n\nDZ Bank\n\nDZ Bank is the central institution for more than 900 co-operative banks (Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken) and their 12,000 branch offices in Germany and is also a corporate and investment bank. It is the fourth-largest bank (total assets: €383 billion) in Germany.

Today the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is by far the largest in Germany with a turnover of more than 90 percent in the German stock market and is the third-largest in Europe after the London Stock Exchange and the European branch of the NYSE Euronext. The most important stock market index in Frankfurt is the DAX, the index of the 30 largest German business companies listed at the stock exchange. The stock exchange is owned and operated by Deutsche Börse, which is itself listed in the DAX. Deutsche Börse also owns the European futures exchange Eurex and the clearing company Clearstream. Today, trading takes place exclusively via the Xetra trading system, with redundant floor brokers taking on the role of market-makers on the new platform.\n\nSince February 2011 Deutsche Börse is in negotiations with NYSE Euronext to merge and become the largest single stock exchange in the world. If the merger actually happens the headquarters of the new company will be located in Frankfurt and in New York City.\n\nOn Feb 1,2012 European Commission has blocked the proposed merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.“The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide,” European competition commissioner( Mr Joaquín Almunia) said.\n\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange is located in the city centre of Frankfurt at the Börsenplatz. Deutsche Börse has its headquarters formally registered in Frankfurt but has moved most of its employees in a newly built high-rise building called \"The Cube\" in Eschborn in 2010, primarily due to significantly lower local corporate taxes.\n\nFrankfurt Trade Fair[]\n\n, headquarters of Goldman Sachs Germany\n\nMain article: Frankfurt Trade Fair\n\nTrade fairs have a very long tradition in Frankfurt as they were first mentioned in the 12th century.
