Although a very urbanized area, it is still filled with heavily wooded forests, mainly of oak — the state tree.\n\nOffenbach District Map\n\nMany of the main towns are in one place towards the cities of Frankfurt am Main and Offenbach am Main on the northern edge. The smaller towns and villages are then strewn across the district amongst streams and woodland.\n\nThe town of Seligenstadt is thought to be one of the oldest in Germany, and has an amazingly ornate basilica within its center.\n\nThe area around Rodgau has some of the driest and mildest of climates. Locals are often found sitting outside playing chess or boules in town squares — a great place to relax.\n\nAnd do visit Neu-Isenburg for the complete opposite. This town is on the flightpath for the 2nd largest airport after Heathrow — the Frankfurt International Airport [FRA]. It is filled with hotels, roads and a huge regional shopping center.\n\nThe choice is yours! ;-)"
