It is an industrial center long famous for the manufacture of leather goods; chemicals, electrical products, textiles, and machinery are also produced. Offenbach was first mentioned in the late 10th cent.; it passed to the counts of Isenburg in the 15th cent. and was annexed by Hesse-Darmstadt in 1816. A Renaissance-style palace (1564–78) and museums of leathercraft, typography, and graphics are located in the city.\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.
