        "text": "How many characters can I fit on a plate?\n\n9 (including spaces), or 10 on a plate with no decal.\n\nWhat about Seals?\n\nSeals require 1 full space (tap on the spacebar or click the half space button twice). You can also place seals above and below a dash/hyphen. First add the space or dash to the desired part of the plate, then add the plate to your cart and then add the desired seals to your cart. Sorry, the website can't show a preview of the seals on the plate.\n\nAre the letters painted on?\n\nThe letters are embossed/pressed into the aluminum plate, and then color is baked on to the text and border. For more info check out this video.\n\nHow much is a plate and shipping?\n\nAlmost all plates are $45 and come with a free universal mounting frame. Standard shipping in the US is $8. To see all our shipping options and destinations, visit our shipping information page.\n\nHow long does it take to get my plate?\n\nWe try to process all orders in one business day. US orders are shipped from California and usually take 2-3 days with standard shipping. International orders are shipped from Germany and take about a week. When your order is shipped, we will send you an email with a tracking number. For more info, visit our shipping information page.\n\nHow many plates are in an order?\n\n1 order is for 1 plate and 1 frame. Of course, you are welcome to change the quantity or purchase additional plates as desired.\n\nCan I choose a different font or add more letters?\n\nSorry, no. We only have the one size & font.\n\nIs mounting hardware included?\n\nNo, it is sold separately. We have a variety of options. To see what will work best for you, visit our mounting hardware page.\n\nWill it fit on my vehicle?\n\nAll our frames are designed to be universal and fit on any vehicle, even with curved bumpers and bumpers with holes for US license plates. Visit the mounting frames page for more info.\n\nHow big are the plates?\n\nThe plates are approximately 20.5\" inches wide by 4.5\" inches tall (or 520mm x 114mm). With the mounting frame, they are 20.75\" inches wide x 5.25\" inches tall (or 530mm x 135mm)."
