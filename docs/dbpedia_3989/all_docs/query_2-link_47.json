        "text": "Frankfurt is the most populous city in the German state of Hesse. Its 763,380 inhabitants as of December 31, 2019 make it the fifth-most populous city in Germany. On the River Main (a tributary of the Rhine), it forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring city of Offenbach am Main and its urban area has a population of 2.3 million. The city is at the centre of the larger Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.5 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr Region. Frankfurt's central business district lies about 90 km (56 mi) northwest of the geographic centre of the EU at Gadheim, Lower Franconia. Like France and Franconia, the city is named after the Franks. Frankfurt is the largest city in the Rhine Franconian dialect area.\n\nFrankfurt has a temperate oceanic climate with warm summers, mild winters and rain is seen throughout the year. The avereage temperature in spring and autumn is almost the same. In winter there is a big chance in seeing snow with temperatues falling below zero regularly. Some winters there are even 40 days with snowfall. December is the least sunny month with only 27 hours of sunshine."
