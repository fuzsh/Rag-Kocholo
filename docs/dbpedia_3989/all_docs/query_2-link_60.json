Neighboring districts are Wetteraukreis, Vogelsbergkreis, Fulda, Bad Kissingen, Main-Spessart, Aschaffenburg, Offenbach and the district-free cities of Offenbach and Frankfurt.\n\nHistory\n\nThe district was created in 1974 by merging the former districts of Hanau, Schlüchtern, Gelnhausen and the former urban district of Hanau. It is basically the former territory of the county of Hesse-Hanau.\n\nGeography\n\nThe district is named after the two primary rivers: the Main flows along the south-west corner of the district. The Kinzig, a tributary of the Main, flows through the district.\n\nAccording to the Institut Géographique National from 1 January 2007 until July 2013 the geographic centre of the European Union was located on a wheat field outside of Gelnhausen.\n\nEconomy\n\nIn 2015 (latest data available) the GDP per inhabitant was €31,433. This places the district 16th out of 26 districts (rural and urban) in Hesse (overall average: €42,732).\n\nTowns and municipalities\n\nCoat of arms\n\nPartnerships\n\nThe oldest partnership was inherited from the previous district Hanau, and was formed in 1972 with the Croatian municipality of Kutina – however it took till the 20th anniversary in 1992 that this partnership was officially signed. In 1986 the district parliament decided to start a developing project with the Diriamba region in Nicaragua.\n\nOther: Darmstadt Government Region, Wiesbaden, Landkreis Bergstraße, Darmstadt-Dieburg, Wetteraukreis, Odenwald, Groß-Gerau, Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis, Offenbach, Darmstadt, Main-Kinzig-Kreis, Hochtaunuskreis, Offenbach am Main, Frankfurt, Main-Taunus-Kreis\n\nNeighbours: Offenbach am Main, Vogelsbergkreis, Offenbach, Fulda, Bad Kissingen, Frankfurt, Main-Spessart, Aschaffenburg, Wetteraukreis\n\nSuggested citation: Michal Páleník: Europe and its regions in numbers - Main-Kinzig-Kreis – DE719, IZ Bratislava, retrieved from: https://www.iz.sk/​PDE719, ISBN: 978-80-970204-9-1, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.10200164\n\nhttps://www.iz.sk/en/projects/eu-regions/DE719"
