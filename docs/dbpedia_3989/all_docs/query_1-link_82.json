        "text": "Offenbach am Main has both rediscovered and reinvented itself in recent years; the Main river, once a key enabler of industrial development, has been transformed into a green lifeline. Many historical heirlooms of the former leather town have been revived and refurbished, and more and more people are finding Offenbach a vibrant and diverse place to live and work. The central location in the heart of one of the economically strongest metropolitan regions in Europe naturally plays an important role: the immediate vicinity of Frankfurt, which is literally within walking distance, makes Offenbach a highly attractive address for people who work in the financial sector and other branches of the economy in the sister city or who appreciate the proximity to the international airport."
