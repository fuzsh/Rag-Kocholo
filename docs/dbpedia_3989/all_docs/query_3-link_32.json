        "text": "Offenbach am Main is an industrial center with the reputation of a leading manufacturer of leather goods across the globe. It’s located in the German state of Hesse, right next to Frankfurt am Main.\n\nApart from the leather industry, it has also pioneered itself in chemicals, electrical products, textiles, and machinery.\n\nTill the very period of early 1970s, Offenbach was leading the way by the means of machine-building and leather industries. Apart from all these, the city was also the European center of typography for some times in the mid 80s.\n\nSome political moves shattered it hopes to gain further dominance in all these areas and it could not live up to its growing expectations. However, the position has changed a bit in its favor in recent years.\n\nIn these times, it has morphosized itself into an admired setting for a wide array of services, particularly from the advertising, design, and transport sectors. The city also hosts the European headquarters of Hyundai Motors.\n\nOn the tourism front, though, Offenbach am Main is not far behind from other German cities. You will get to see a Renaissance-style palace, as well as museums of typography and graphics. The Bieber’s observation tower is there to remind you of the city’s dominance in the leather industry, as so does the German Leather Museum (Deutsches Ledermuseum).\n\nIt is considered among the biggest museums of the world in the midst of a wide variety of collection of leather items. All along the leather stuff, it also includes a number of exhibits, which are thought to be more than 3,000 years old.\n\nYou will get to see three wings in the museum, namely, the German Shoe Museum, the Museum for Applied Art and the Ethnology Museum. The museum takes account of a grand variety of leather items on show together with shoes, saddles, bookcases, photo albums, leather furniture, and toys.\n\nLast but not least, Offenbach is also the seat of the German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst)."
