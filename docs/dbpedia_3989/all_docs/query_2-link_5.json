        "text": "Geography\n\nHessen lies between the Upper Rhine Plateau to the west and the Thuringian Forest to the east and consists mainly of richly wooded uplands. The Hessen Central Uplands contain the conical masses of the volcanic Vogels Mountains (Vogelsberg), which are the largest continuous basalt area in Europe, covering some 950 square miles (2,460 square km). The Rhön, in eastern Hessen, is a mountainous mass rising to the Wasser Peak (3,117 feet [950 metres]), Hessen’s highest mountain. The Spessart Forest and the Odenwald both belong in part to Hessian territory. The northern part of Hessen is drained by the northward-flowing Fulda River and its tributary the Eder. Near Münden the Fulda unites with the Werra River to form the Weser. Most of the rest of the state is drained westward by rivers that are tributaries of the Main and Rhine rivers. Beeches and conifers cover the highlands, and cultivated land lies on the limestone uplands and on the loess soils of the river lowlands.\n\nThe largest cities are Frankfurt am Main, Wiesbaden, Kassel, Darmstadt, and Offenbach am Main. The majority of the population is Protestant, and most of the remainder is Roman Catholic.\n\nThe state is well wooded, and small-scale farming is still widespread, although much marginal farmland has been abandoned. Wheat is the most widely grown crop, followed by potatoes and sugar beets. Poultry, pigs, and cattle are the chief livestock. Southwestern Hessen is primarily industrial, but it is also an area of intensive agriculture. The plains along the Rhine and Main rivers are a mosaic of vineyards, orchards, and fields of grain, potatoes, and tobacco. The surrounding hills have a three-year rotation of rye, oats, and potatoes, and livestock farms focus on the production of butter and cheese. Market gardening is especially important near the cities.\n\nThe state’s mineral resources are quite limited. There are some low-grade iron ores, of little economic significance, in the Taunus Mountains, salt mines near Fulda, and small brown-coal deposits near Frankfurt am Main and Kassel. The Werra valley in Kassel is the site of Germany’s largest potash fields.\n\nThe state’s industries depend on the Rhine waterway and its extensions up the Main and Neckar. The Rhine-Main area, centred on Frankfurt am Main, Mainz, and Wiesbaden, is one of the great industrial regions of Germany. Kassel, Offenbach, Wiesbaden, and Darmstadt are other large manufacturing centres. Quality steel is produced in Wetzlar. Vehicles, machinery, chemicals, electrical goods, scientific instruments, and textiles are among the products of these and other towns. New industries have developed since World War II, stimulated by the arrival of German refugees from eastern Europe. These enterprises include the making of glass, toys, and musical instruments. Book publishing is a prominent economic activity as well. Frankfurt am Main is an important financial centre, home to the European Union’s central bank and Germany’s major stock market.\n\nHessen has a highly developed network of highways, and there are federal and private bus services. The Rhine provides the chief waterway, and its economic importance cannot be overestimated. Frankfurt Airport is one of the largest and busiest airports in Europe. Rail travel in Hessen is well developed and has international European links, aided in recent years by high-speed passenger service focusing on Frankfurt am Main.\n\nThe state’s legislative body, the Landtag, elected by the people, in turn elects a minister-president. The minister-president appoints ministers with the consent of the Landtag. A vote of no confidence in the Landtag can force the resignation of the government."
