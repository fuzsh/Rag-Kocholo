        "text": "It's not necessarily a surprise, but the cost of getting a speeding ticket in Minnesota continues to increase. Here's what it'll cost you now if you're cited for exceeding the speed limit in the North Star State.\n\nSince the pandemic, speeding has been an increasingly problematic issue here in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. According to the Minnesota Department of Transportation Office of Traffic Safety (MDPS/OTS):\n\n* Preliminary reports show 120 motorists died in speed-related crashes in 2020, the most since 2008 (125).\n\n* In the last five years (2016-2020), 485 people died in speed-related traffic fatalities.\n\nSpeed contributed to 30 percent of all traffic fatalities in 2020.\n\n* The Minnesota State Patrol issued more than 1,068 speeding tickets for speeds of 100 mph or more in 2020, compared with 533 tickets for those excessive speeds in 2019.\n\n* Speed was a primary contributor in the jump from 364 traffic deaths on Minnesota roads in 2019 to the preliminary figure of 395 in 2020.\n\nThe MDPS/OTS also notes that speeding also creates a greater potential for loss of vehicle control, requires an increased stopping distance, gives drivers less time for to respond to a potential crash, and leads to and increase in the severity of crashes, which can lead to more severe injuries or even death.\n\nALSO INTERESTING: 10 Cars That Get The Most Speeding Tickets in Minnesota\n\nSo it's not a surprise that the cost of speeding tickets continues to rise across the North Star State, either. MDPS/OTS says the costs involved can impact your back account, driving record and insurance rates. But the cost of the actual speeding ticket isn't cheap these days:\n\nThe cost of a speeding violation will vary by county, but it will typically cost a driver more than $110 with court fees for traveling 10 mph over the limit. Fines double for those speeding 20 mph over the limit and drivers can lose their license for six months for going 100 mph or more, MDPS/OTS says.\n\nMeanwhile, this Bankrate story says that besides the actual cost of the ticket, you'll likely also pay a lot more in insurance costs, with rates increasing between 23 to 25 percent, on average from what drivers without any tickets on their record pay:\n\n\"On average, Minnesota drivers with a single speeding ticket pay $2,711 per year for full coverage car insurance and $844 for the minimum amount of insurance required by the state,\" Bankrate noted.\n\nListen to Curt St. John & Samm Adams\n\nWeekdays from 6 to 10 a.m. on Quick Country 96.5"
