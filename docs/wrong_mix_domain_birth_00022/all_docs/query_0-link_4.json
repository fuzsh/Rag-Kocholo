        "text": "Timothy Zachary Mosley (born Mairch 10, 1972),[1] better kent bi his stage name Timbaland, is an American record producer, rapper, sangster, sangwriter an DJ.[2]\n\nTimbaland's furst fu credit production wark wis in 1996 on Ginuwine...the Bachelor for R&B sangster Ginuwine. Efter forderw irk on Aaliyah's 1996 album One in a Million an Missy Elliott's 1997 album Supa Dupa Fly, Timbaland becam a prominent producer for R&B an hip hop airtists.

In 2002, Timbaland produced the hit single \"Cry Me a River\" for Justin Timberlake, gangin on tae produce maist o Timberlake's subsequent LPs siclik FutureSex/LoveSounds an The 20/20 Experience an thair respective hit singles. A Timbaland-awnt imprint label, Mosley Music Group, featurt airtists sic as Nelly Furtado, thats Timbaland-produced album Loose (2006) wis a commercial an critical success. In 2007, Timbaland released a solo album, Shock Value, that wis follaed bi Shock Value II in 2009.\n\nAside frae the aforementionet airtists, Timbaland's production credits frae the 2000s forrit include wirk wi Jay-Z, Nas, Ludacris, Bubba Sparxxx, Madonna, Rihanna, OneRepublic, Brandy, Drake, Rick Ross an ithers. As a sangwriter he haes scrieven as o 2014, 85 UK hits an 99 hits Stateside.[3] Timbaland haes received widespread acclaim for his production style. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly statit that \"just about every current pop trend can be traced back to him — from sultry, urban-edged R&B songstresses ... to the art of incorporating avant-garde sounds into No. 1 hits.\"[4]\n\nEarly life[eedit | eedit soorce]\n\nTimothy Z. Mosley wis born on 10 Mairch 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, tae Latrice, that ran a hameless shelter, an Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee.[1][5] He graduated frae Salem High School o Virginia Beach, Virginia.[2][6] Durin his time as a DJ, he wis kent as \"DJ Tim\"[7] or \"DJ Timmy Tim\".[8] His brither, Sebastian, is reportedly aroond nine year younger.[9] His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup airtist an author frae New Jersey. Whiles attendin heich schuil, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration wi rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley forby jyned the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which featurt Neptunes producer Pharrell an aw.[8] Mosley was heich schuil freends wi brithers Terrence an Gene Thornton as weel, that wad become kent as Pusha T an Malice o the rap group Clipse, respectively.[10] In 1986, when Timbaland wis 14 year auld, he wis accidentally shot bi a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant an wis partially paralyzed for nine month.[11] Durin this time, he began tae learn how tae DJ usin his left hand.[12]\n\nSangstress an rapper Missy Elliott haurd his material an began wirkin wi him. She an her R&B group, Sista, auditioned for DeVante Swing, a producer an member o the successfu R&B act Jodeci. DeVante signed Sista tae his Swing Mob record label an Elliott brocht Mosley an Barcliff alang wi her tae New York, whaur Swing Mob wis based. It wis DeVante wha renamit the young producer Timbaland, efter the Timberland brand o construction boots.[citation needit] He an Magoo becam pairt o SCI Zakys School stable o Swing Mob signees kent as \"Da Bassment\" crew, joinin airtists sic as R&B sangster Ginuwine, male vocal group Playa (Smoke E. Digglera, Static Major an Digital Black), an the girl group Sugah.[8] Timbaland did production wirk on a number o projects wi DeVante, includin the 1995 Jodeci LP The Show, The After-Party, The Hotel, an Sista’s (unreleased) début LP 4 All the Sistas Around da World. Elliott began receivin recognition as a sangwriter for airtists sic as R&B girl group 702 an MC Lyte. Due tae Timbaland's connection wi her, he wis often contacted tae produce remixes o her sangs.[13]\n\nCareer[eedit | eedit soorce]\n\n1994–2002: Focus on production work an Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment[eedit | eedit soorce]\n\nTimbaland began his producin career for R&B acts. In the early-1990s, he producit a few sangs for R&B acts sic as Jodeci an Sista. In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough bi producin the majority o baith Aaliyah's seicont album One in a Million an Ginuwine's debut album Ginuwine...the Bachelor. This included the major hit singles \"If Your Girl Only Knew\" bi Aaliyah an \"Pony\" bi Ginuwine. While Timbaland wis initially producin for R&B airtists, his trademark sound wis very much rooted in hip-hop wi its fast-paced nature an clear drum breaks. He wis takin a hip-hop sound an applyin it tae R&B, an in this way his sound wis instrumental in blurrin the distinction atween hip-hop an R&B production.[14] In 1997, he fully produced Supa Dupa Fly, the debut album o Missy Elliott, wha haed been a childhood friend o Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued wi his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the muisic wis considered hip-hop. In 1997, he released his first album wi his partner Magoo, Welcome to Our World, a hip-hop album an aw. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound wad become very influential an common as he produced for mony heich-profile hip-hop airtists includin Jay-Z, Nas, an The LOX. In 1999, he scored a major hit wi Jay Z an rap group UGK wi the hit \"Big Pimpin'\". He fully produced Missy's seicont album in 1999 an aw, Da Real World. Still Timbaland in this period produced primarily for R&B airtists. He continued tae produce for Ginuwine an Aaliyah, as well as contributin significantly tae albums bi Xscape, Nicole, Playa, an Total. He remixed Usher's major hit \"You Make Me Wanna\". In the early 2000s Timbaland produced sangs includin Ludacris' \"Roll Out (My Business)\",[15] Jay-Z's \"Hola' Hovito\",[16] Petey Pablo's \"Raise Up\",[17] an Beck's civer o David Bowie's \"Diamond Dogs\" durin this period.[18] He forby contributed three sangs, all eventually released as singles, tae Aaliyah’s self-teetled third album, the exotic lead single \"We Need a Resolution\" (featurin himself rapping a verse), \"More than a Woman\", an the ballad \"I Care 4 U\".[19] He forby makes an appearance in Aaliyah's single \"Try Again\", which he produced an co-wrote an aw.\n\nTimbaland & Magoo’s seicont album thegither wis slatit for release in November 2000. Indecent Proposal wis tae feature appearances bi Beck, Aaliyah, as weel as new Timbaland protégés—some frae his new Beat Club Records imprint--Ms. Jade, Kiley Dean, Sebastian (Timbaland's brither), Petey Pablo, an Tweet (wha wis a member o Sugah durin the Swing Mob days). The album wis delayed for an entire year, finally released in November 2001. It wis a commercial disappointment. Beck’s vocals for the track \"I Am Music\" war not included on the last version, which instead featurt Timbaland singin alang Steve \"Static\" Garrett o Playa an Aaliyah.[20] The first release on Beat Club wis the début album bi Bubba Sparxxx in September 2001, Dark Days, Bright Nights.[21] The loss o Aaliyah deeply affected Timbaland. In a phone call tae the MTV shaw Total Request Live, Timbaland said:\n\nShe was like blood, and I lost blood. Me and her together had this chemistry. I kinda lost half of my creativity to her. It's hard for me to talk to the fans now. Beyond the music, she was a brilliant person, the [most special] person I ever met.[22]\n\n— Timbaland, MTV\n\n2003–2005: Production work for pop recording airtists[eedit | eedit soorce]\n\nTimbaland contributed three tracks tae Tweet's debut album, Southern Hummingbird, an produced maist o Missy Elliott's fourth an fifth LPs, Under Construction an This Is Not A Test!.[23] He produced tracks for airtists sic as Lil' Kim (\"The Jump Off\") an southern rapper Pastor Troy durin this period an aw.[24] Collaboratin wi fellae producer Scott Storch, Timbaland forby worked on a number o tracks on former *NSYNC lead sangster Justin Timberlake’s solo debut, Justified, includin the sang \"Cry Me a River\".[25]\n\nLate in 2003, Timbaland delivered the seicont Bubba Sparxxx album, Deliverance, an the third Timbaland & Magoo album, Under Construction, Part II Baith albums war released tae little fanfare or acclaim even though Deliverance wis praised bi reviews an embraced bi the internet community.[26] In 2004 Timbaland produced singles for LL Cool J, Xzibit, Fatman Scoop, an Jay-Z, an he produced the bulk o Brandy’s fourth album, Afrodisiac.[27] Timbaland co-wrote twa tracks (Exodus '04 an Let Me Give You My Love) an produced three tracks o the American-Japanese Pop star Hikaru Utada’s seicont English album, Exodus.[28] He continued wirkin on tracks for Tweet an for Elliott’s sixth album, The Cookbook: \"Joy (feat.

A rivalry flared up atween Timbaland an record producer Scott Storch in early 2007. The tension initially started on the single \"Give It to Me\", when Timbaland anonymously backlashed Storch: \"I'm a real producer and you['re] just the piano man\". In an interview, Timbaland confirmed that he wis talkin aboot Storch. The dispute partly stemmed frae controversy regardin writin credits for Timberlake's \"Cry Me a River\".[41]\n\n2008: Focus on ither projects[eedit | eedit soorce]\n\nTimbaland helped produce mony albums for various airtists in 2008, includin Madonna's Hard Candy,[42] Ashlee Simpson's Bittersweet World, Keri Hilson's In A Perfect World, Flo Rida's Mail On Sunday, Letoya Luckett's Lady Love, Lindsay Lohan's Spirit in the Dark, Chris Cornell's Scream, JoJo's All I Want Is Everything, Nicole Scherzinger's Her Name is Nicole, Missy Elliott's Block Party, Matt Pokora's MP3, Keithian's Dirrty Pop, The Pussycat Dolls's Doll Domination, Busta Rhymes's B.O.M.B, Lisa Maffia's Miss Boss, Teairra Mari's Pressed For Time,[43] Jennifer Hudson's début album, Dima Bilan's Believe, Samantha Jade's My Name Is Samantha Jade, New Kids on the Block's The Block, an Keshia Chanté's Night & Day.
