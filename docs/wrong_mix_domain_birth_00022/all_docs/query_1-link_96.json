        "text": "Justin Timberlake has confirmed that he is working on a new album.\n\nThe pop star released his first new song in three years earlier this week, sharing ‘Can’t Stop The Feeling’. The track is taken from the soundtrack of the new animated film Trolls.\n\nTimberlake provides the voice of main character Branch in the Dreamworks movie, which will be released in November.\n\nNow, in a new interview, he has revealed fans can expect more new music to come from him soon. Rolling Stone reports he told Carson Daly’s radio show: “I don’t know exactly when I’m going to put it out but yeah, I’m definitely working on a new album.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also said what he was working on was influenced by his southern roots. “I think where I grew up in America has a lot of influence,” he said. “Growing up in Tennessee — very central of the country — Memphis is known as the birthplace of rock and roll, but also the home of the blues, but Nashville’s right down the street so there’s a lot of country music.”\n\nTimbaland previously hinted that he is planning to record a country album with Justin Timberlake.\n\nThe hip-hop producer said he was considering heading into the studio with the singer, in an interview with TMZ, following Timberlake’s performance of ‘Drink You Away’ with country singer Chris Stapleton at the CMA Awards.\n\nRecommended\n\nGetty"
