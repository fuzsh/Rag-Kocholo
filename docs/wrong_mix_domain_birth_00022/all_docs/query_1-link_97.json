I have been in the studio with Pharrell, I have been in the studio with Max Martin, I have been in the studio with Timbaland.\n\n\"But I really did grow up in a place in America that was two hours from the country music capital of the world, home of the blues, birthplace of American rock and roll.\"\n\nImage: Rex\n\nTimbaland has been Timberlake's longtime collaborator, having produced much of his last album The 20/20 Experience (parts 1 and 2) as well as his previous albums FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006) and Justified (2002).\n\nMeanwhile, super producer Max Martin helmed his latest worldwide smash Can't Stop The Feeling!, which serves as the theme song to new animated comedy film Trolls.\n\nJustin has three Number 1 albums to his name on the Official Chart, as well as four chart-topping singles.
