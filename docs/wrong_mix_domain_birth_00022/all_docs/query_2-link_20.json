        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nBorn March 10th, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, Timbaland started deejaying and met his fellow rap partner Magoo as a teenager. He soon met Missy Elliott and producer and artist DeVante Swing, which led him to producing work for other acts. After success with Aaliyah and Ginuwine, Timbaland began releasing albums with Magoo as well as solo efforts. More and more popular singers became eager to work with the hit-making producer as his success grew, which has made him one of the biggest artists in music today. In this http://www.WatchMojo.com video, we take a look at the life and career of Timbaland."
