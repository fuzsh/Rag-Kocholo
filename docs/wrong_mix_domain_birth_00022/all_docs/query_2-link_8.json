        "meta_description": "Timothy Zachery Mosley, known professionally as Timbaland, is an American record producer, rapper, and singer. Born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, he has received widespread acclaim for his innovative production work and distinctive \"stuttering\" rhythmic style. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly stated that \"just about every current pop trend can be traced back to him—from sultry, urban-edged R&B songstresses [...] to the art of incorporating avant-garde sounds into No. 1 hits.\"\nTimbaland's first major production credit was on the album Ginuwine...the Bachelor by R&B singer Ginuwine. Further commercial success on his following productions, including Aaliyah's second studio album One in a Million and Missy Elliott's debut studio album Supa Dupa Fly, made him a sought-after producer among R&B and hip hop artists. He performed as a recording artist himself while doing so, releasing three albums as part of the Virginia-based hip hop duo Timbaland & Magoo, along with his debut solo album, Tim's Bio.",
