        "text": "The culture will not be televised. Better yet, it shall be streamed.\n\nWhat originally started as a live song-for-song set at Hot 97's Summer Jam concert in 2018 between musical powerhouses Timbaland and Swizz Beatz has now found its way into countless quarantined homes. The recommence of Verzuz began and continues to serve as a celebration of Black musical pioneers: the DJs, songwriters, singers, rappers, producers, performers—and everybody in between.\n\nThe battles are selected by how sonically and entertaining both artists can be together. Kicking off in March, the growing phenom has showcased battles between Teddy Riley vs. Babyface, Boi-1da vs. Hit-Boy, The-Dream vs. Sean Garrett, Erykah Badu vs. Jill Scott, Johntá Austin vs. Ne-Yo, Nelly vs. Ludacris, T-Pain vs. Lil Jon, Scott Storch vs. Mannie Fresh, DJ Premier vs. RZA, Ryan Tedder vs. Benny Blanco, 112 vs. Jagged Edge and Beenie Man vs. Bounty Killer.\n\nWhile each battle gives birth to memorable memes, it serves as a masterclass and introduction to the other masterminds behind some of our favorite songs. GRAMMY winner Sean Garrett expresses how Verzuz gave him the opportunity to build with new fans. \"I noticed people were putting a face to the name in addition to the younger generation that didn’t necessarily grow up on the music I created.\" During his Verzuz battle with songwriter and singer The-Dream, Sean shared an incredible story relating to Usher's 2004 smash, \"Yeah.\" \"Originally, it wasn’t even supposed to be a part of Confessions. Usher wasn’t crazy about the song but we ended up leaking it over the Christmas holiday and before we could even record a music video for it, it was no. 1 on the Hot 100 charts. It sat at no. 1 for 12 weeks and is currently no. 14 on the greatest hits of all time on the Hot 100 list.\"\n\nWhen media personality Joe Budden suggested a battle between Johntá Austin and Ne-Yo on Twitter, Austin felt encouraged to participate in the online battle that offers no monetary compensation. \"A lot of people didn’t know who I was before the battle,\" Austin says. The two-time GRAMMY winner is credible for contributing to Mariah Carey’s biggest record, We Belong Together, which spent 43 weeks at no. 1 on Billboard. His extensive resume also includes hits with Mary J. Blige, Aaliyah, Chris Brown and more.\n\nAfter his participation in Verzuz, more labels and artists have reached out about his songwriting skills. His Instagram Live series, Mastery, which he hosts alongside fellow hitmaker Bryan-Michael Cox, has also blossomed post-battle. \"Verzuz educates people on who did the song, and Mastery picks up and continues the education on the stories not just behind the songs, but the journey of the creatives over the years of their careers and how they came to create that magic,\" he states.\n\nWhat also results from the battles is what is now called the \"Verzuz Effect,\" i.e., an influx in streams, social media engagement and widespread recognition. Following the Teddy Riley and Babyface battle, they collectively registered three million on-demand audio streams in the U.S. According to the Verzuz Instagram account, Babyface's Instagram following increased by 129 percent, going from 420K to breaking the million mark. Teddy Riley made the jump from 328K to just under a million followers. Both Jill Scott's and Erykah Badu’s catalog skyrocketed over 300 percent by the next morning. Recently, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland won a Webby award for Verzuz \"Breaking the Internet.\" Instagram's Head of Music Partnerships, Fadia Kader, shared sentiments that further confirms that their Webby award was well-deserved. \"[Verzuz] is definitely one of the most viewed Instagram Lives. It brings the community together, fans together, creates a safe space for reminiscing on good times and nostalgia. It celebrates artists and gives them their flowers in real time.\"\n\nFadia and her team work diligently with Swizz, Timbaland and the \"competitors\" to ensure their \"Verzuz kit\" of preparation has been put to full use to avoid technicalities during the anticipated affair. As \"live\" continues to serve as the current cord of connection between the artist and their audience, Instagram’s long-term goal is to elevate the musical experience for the user. A common issue the series came across, for example, was that the series would cut off after an hour. However, Erykah and Jill’s show continued past the 60-minute mark undisturbed. \"I definitely think ‘live’ has shown that there is a need to connect in real time, as a product and company, we’re going to seek opportunity to add new features and tools to elevate the experience,\" Kader says.\n\nAlong with DJ D-Nice's Dance Parties and Tory Lanez's \"Quarantine Radio,\" Verzuz has become a livestream staple for the Facebook-owned platform. Although both organizers have established that they have not profited off of the series, artists have ingeniously created merchandise for the virtual event. The implementation of a 90-second rule for artists has now been regulated to avoid copyright claims that have disrupted livestreams. Prior to this rule, the New Jack Swing originator Teddy Riley allegedly attempted to stream his battle with Babyface on his personal platform. Despite facing criticism for it, a question on the value of Instagram's partnership with this impactful cultural movement could be made in hindsight. \"We [Instagram] have always collaborated with hip-hop and R&B. I think just more than ever, the rest of the world is seeing that hip-hop is really pop culture. It is the driver, it is the influence that influences the influencers.\" Kader continues, \"So I am glad that we have been a part of that narrative and been contributing to the culture all along.\"\n\nThis spirit of this type of musical competition is far from new in the island of Jamaica. Legendary reggae and dancehall artists Beenie Man and Bounty Killer exuberantly performed their songs together in one room for their musical sound-off. This influential form of battling, also known as a sound clash, derived from being an underground event in the West Indian capital of Kingston. It soon inspired the inception of the hip-hop battles in the Bronx, and shortly after was adopted all over the world. The digital combat, which was the first one to go live on the Verzuz Instagram account, was not only proof of the global impact Caribbean culture has on music but was a trajectory moment for Verzuz. The two performers ended their in-studio sound clash with a prayer and an ode to the late Bob Marley with his timeless classic \"One Love.\" It was another demonstration of a vital aspect of what Verzuz represents: a source of healing during this uncertain and dark time.\n\nThe magnitude of Verzuz may come as a pleasant surprise, however, the ability for us as a culture to prevail in wavering times seems almost innate. Best known for popularizing the Crunk musical genre, Lil Jon was more than happy to participate in the friendly competition with T-Pain. \"Verzuz is a good way to get your mind off of what is going on in the world right now. You can’t deal with this all day every day. You need relief every now and then to keep your sanity. I think we gave some people a good time,\" says the Atlanta native.\n\nSo what comes next for Verzuz? That part is still a mystery to the dedicated followers who remain optimistic for an expansion in some form beyond the online platform. Swizz Beatz mentioned on his own Instagram account that he is currently filming the Verzuz documentary. Timbaland spoke on rumors of Ludacris and Nelly touring together and how Kevin Hart wants to do a Verzuz Comedy series. Lil Jon and T-Pain are also considering a tour and collaborating in the television and film realm. Jon, who along with Garrett, won a GRAMMY for Usher’s Yeah, agrees that Verzuz is powerfully moving the needle for the culture. \"Verzuz showed me that we as a people can adapt. No one was using Instagram the way we are using it now. All of the urban artists took that platform, turned it upside down and changed it into something that when they created it—they never could imagine it would turn into this. That's urban, that’s Black folk. We did that. It's our culture that is taking over the internet at this time. Swizz and Tim created a TV show for us to watch and enjoy through our cell phones. They even brought Babyface out of nowhere!\"\n\nOn 'Things Fall Apart,' The Roots Deepened Hip-Hop\n\nWe’re fortunate enough to be living in the middle of a Missy Elliott resurgence — not that she ever went away.\n\nThree decades into her groundbreaking career, Missy is readying her very first headlining tour, which begins July 4 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Out of This World Tour runs through August and features her longtime collaborators Timbaland, Busta Rhymes, and Ciara.\n\nThe fact that it is her first headlining tour may be surprising, given that she’s been on the scene since debuting with the group Sista in the mid-1990s, and has been a chart-topping star since becoming a solo artist in 1997.\n\nThe hip-hop icon released her last full-length album, The Cookbook, nearly two decades ago but time hasn’t diminished her influence at all. In fact, we’re all still catching up to the futuristic vision that Missy and Timbaland introduced to the world in the late 1990s in their songs and videos.\n\nMissy began her career as a member of Sista, which was a part of the Swing Mob, a musical collective working under Jodeci’s DeVanté Swing. That crew included a number of future world-changers, including Missy, Timbaland, Ginuwine, Tweet, Stevie J., and two legends who have since passed on, Magoo and Static Major. After Sista was dropped from their label, Missy, by all accounts, would have been perfectly happy to settle into a life as a songwriter and producer. But something bigger was beckoning.\n\nPersuaded by Elektra’s Sylvia Rhone with the promise of her own label, Missy agreed to turn in one album as a solo artist. That album, 1997’s Supa Dupa Fly, made Missy not just a star but an icon, and changed the course of her life. It began a career that, over a quarter-century later, found her inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame — she was the first female rapper ever to be nominated for the latter.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning of the accolades. There are the four GRAMMY wins and head-spinning 22 nominations. She was also honored alongside Dr. Dre, Lil Wayne (who has not been shy about calling Missy his favorite rapper), and the woman who gave Missy her first solo record deal, Sylvia Rhone, at 2023’s Black Music Collective’s Recording Academy Honors event. Missy was also a key participant in the GRAMMYs tribute to a half-century of hip-hop that same year.\n\nThroughout it all, Missy has remained humble. When speaking to GRAMMY.com in 2022, she reflected on how she and longtime collaborator Timbaland had no idea of their impact at the time.\n\n\"We really just came out with a sound that we had been doing for some time, but we had no clue that it would be game changing, that we would change the cadence — the sound of what was happening at that time,\" she said. \"No clue!\"\n\n\"Her whole existence is based on moving us and influencing us,\" says her longtime manager Mona Scott-Young. \"She wants to be able to touch people.\"\n\nAnd that she has. To celebrate the Missy-aissance, GRAMMY.com spoke with Missy's colleagues and collaborators for an insider’s view on the course of her career and what makes the four-time GRAMMY winner unique.\n\nThe quotes and comments used in this feature were edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nMissy’s Impact Began With Her First Guest Verse\n\nThe first time many people took note of Missy Elliott was her verse on the 1996 remix of Gina Thompson’s \"That Thing You Do.\"\n\nGina Thompson (singer): I was in the process of completing my first album, Nobody Does It Better. Actually, it was complete. So what happened was, my A&R at the time, Bruce Carbone at Mercury Records, wanted to have Puffy do the remix.\n\nPuffy was like, \"We have this person that's really talented. Her name's Missy, and she used to be with the group Sista, and she's a phenomenal writer. She's working with a lot of other artists, she’s definitely the next big thing in the R&B/hip-hop world.\" We were like, cool.\n\nI believe we actually heard it over the speaker phone in Bruce’s office. I know that I said that I loved it, and I felt her style was unique and different. It grew on me in a great way. I just felt like it was a smash. She definitely had added a great touch to it. I was super-excited about it.\n\nMerlin Bobb (former Executive Vice President, Elektra Records): I was blown away by the simple fact that I knew she was a great songwriter. But when I heard her rhyming, I thought it was the most unique style that I had heard in some time.\n\nDigital Black (former member of Playa, part of the Swing Mob): A lot of people only knew her as a writer or an R&B artist, but when she came on that Gina Thompson record with that rap, it changed everything. It allowed her to be even more herself.\n\nMona Scott-Young (manager): Oh my God, have you heard that song? It’s her ability to use expression and evoke emotion without even using words. She said, \"He he he haw,\" and we all found a new way to bounce. There was something fun and magical and different that spoke to what we would come to know was this incredibly vivid imagination that would take us places sonically and visually that we didn’t even know we needed to be.\n\nRead more: 50 Artists Who Changed Rap: Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem & More\n\nShe Changed The Sound Of Hip-Hop With Her Debut LP\n\nMissy’s first solo album, Supa Dupa Fly, came out the following year. It gave new energy to a hip-hop scene that was still reeling from the deaths of 2Pac and Biggie.\n\nAnne Kristoff (former Vice President of PR, Elektra): She 100 percent did not want to be an artist. She's like, \"I'm not an artist. I want to be Diane Warren. I'm going to write the songs. I'm going to be behind the scenes.\"\n\nMerlin Bobb: I started talking to her regarding being an artist. She was totally against it. \"No, I want to be a songwriter.\" And also, just to be honest, [Sista] had been dropped from Elektra prior to my conversations with her, so she wasn't too eager, I think, to jump back aboard.\n\nIt took about six or seven months of us discussing ways to do this. I spoke to Sylvia [Rhone, then-head of Elektra], and I said, \"She's an incredible songwriter. Let's offer her a production deal or a label deal where she can not only just look at herself as an artist, but at the same time develop and nurture artists under her own banner.\" Sylvia thought it was a great idea.\n\nWe both talked to Missy about it, and she said, \"Okay, I'll do one album.\" I was ecstatic because she was writing some great songs, but she also gave us her first album, which was, needless to say, a classic.\n\nKathy Iandoli (author, \"God Save the Queens: The Essential History of Women in Hip-Hop and Baby Girl: Better Known as Aaliyah\"): In God Save the Queens, I referred to her as the Andy Warhol of hip-hop, in the sense that she took the art and the cultural aspect of it, and she just put this spin and interpretation of the art that no one had ever really done prior.\n\nWith Missy’s arrival around ‘97, we were at a point in time where hip-hop was in a complete state of confusion. We did not know where it was going to go. Missy made high art hip-hop that was commercially accessible. And for that, she changed the entire game.\n\nGina Thompson: When she had her first project with the whole vision — not only her sound, but her songwriting style, the look — everyone was like, \"This girl went out on edge. I'm gonna do a little bit of the same thing and not be so worried if I don't sound so average, what people are going to think. Because she's out on the edge doing it.\" And I promise you, ever since she came out, that you started hearing a lot more of female rappers tweaking their voices.\n\nLenny Holmes (guitarist): In hip-hop, everybody would think that it's a whole bunch of computer generated stuff. Missy Elliott does not approach it like that. She loves live instrumentation, but she likes to take bits and pieces of it. She simplifies it, and it is placed uniquely in the track at certain points. That's what makes up the structure of the song.\n\nMona Scott-Young: Everything from the way she looked to what she was talking about to the way she delivered that music and what she represented in terms of being nonconforming, not looking like the other female rappers of the day — I think all of those elements were the perfect lightning in a bottle. The way she rode that beat, both lyrically and with her delivery, was very, very different from everything else that we were hearing.\n\nRead more: Revisiting 'Supa Dupa Fly' At 25: Missy Elliott Is Still Inspired By Her Debut Record\n\nShe Reinvented The Music Video\n\nYou can’t think of Missy Elliott without picturing her iconic music videos, many done in collaboration with director Hype Williams.\n\nBrian Greenspoon (former International Publicist, Elektra): I mean, she came out of the gate wearing a garbage bag, and made it the coolest thing anyone had ever seen.\n\nMerlin Bobb: She said, if I put out this album — initially we were talking about a single deal, but we went into an album — there’s two things very important to me: the dance aspect and the visual aspect.\n\nKathy Iandoli: The thing that I really loved about Missy's music videos, she was a big budget music video person. She got the men's music video budget.\n\nAnne Kristoff: When you think about the \"Rain\" video — I'm just guessing, I don't want to put words in her mouth — but I think when she saw that the vision in her head could become real out in the world, that anything she could think of could happen, that maybe it made it a little more fun for her to be an artist. I hope.\n\nDigital Black: Missy is one of the funniest people you’ll ever meet. People maybe don't know. She loves joking. So that was just her being her.\n\nGina Thompson: You started seeing a lot of people doing certain robotic-type images or moves in their videos to almost mimic her \"Supa Dupa Fly.\" She’s the creator of that.\n\nEarl Baskerville (manager/producer): Missy would get with the director, and she would sit there and go over the whole treatment. A lot of the visuals came from her. She was very hands on. Today, you can shoot a video in four or five hours. But Missy’s video shoots was so long, I used to hate it. We would be there fifteen hours for a three minute video!\n\nShe Was Avant-Garde But Still Pop\n\nMissy’s musical and visual style was like nothing anyone had ever seen. Yet she still became a star. How did she manage to be both innovative and accessible?\n\nKathy Iandoli: You can't make something that the general public can't access, or speak over their heads.\n\nDigital Black: Even if you said it sounded weird, it still had some soulfulness to it. I think that was what allowed her to touch so many different people.\n\nMerlin Bobb: When you have an artist that stands out, but it doesn't go over your head musically, artistically, lyrically, then it works. People, when they heard and experienced something new and fresh that was easy to digest, but it was unique, they gravitated to it.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: How was it sold to a mass audience? I mean, the sound was breakthrough. What Timbaland was doing with drum sounds, and the way they were building these very sparse rhythms and sound beds, they were breaking ground. But the thing that worked is that they had these incredible songs that Missy was writing and that she had these incredible featured artists on.\n\nGina Thompson: To try to figure out what her brain is doing, I’ve been gave that up.\n\nEarl Baskerville: Nobody could figure out what we were doing, because they couldn’t understand the sound.\n\nLenny Holmes: Her rhythmic style of how she would do the vocals was just unheard of. Like, doubling up accents. The things that she started doing — you would hear a deejay do a scratch on a record. You would not hear a singer do it. I was like, What in the world?\n\nAnne Kristoff: She was doing these really creative things that no one else was doing visually. And the sound was different than whatever everyone else was doing. So it wasn't a hard sell for the press.\n\nShe Was A Master At Working With Other Artists\n\nMissy was far more than just a solo star. All throughout her career, she continued her first love: writing and producing for other artists — including Ciara, Aaliyah, Destiny’s Child, and Whitney Houston.\n\nLenny Holmes: Missy had a great relationship with singers and rappers, because she could do both. A lot of people don’t know, but Missy can sing. So when we worked with groups that had singing parts on them, a lot of times she would go ahead and lay down the guide track for the actual artist to sing.\n\nKathy Iandoli: Missy just really understood the artists that she worked with. She saw their strengths, and she helped them utilize them to the best of their capabilities.\n\nAngelique Miles (former music publishing executive): She was able to relate to the artist and express that artist. She was able to customize and express that artist's story. Whatever she wrote for 702 didn’t sound like what she wrote for Whitney Houston.\n\nDigital Black: She was good at listening to the artist, seeing what they do, and then, how can you enhance what they do well? Those are the best records. She was great at tailor-making records for people, just from her doing her due diligence on learning who the artist is. Not just going in, \"I’m Missy, I can write whatever.\" I'm gonna write something specifically for you that enhances what you’ve already done.\n\nMerlin Bobb: She would have made an incredible A&R person. I would have hired her back then. She was able to come up with lyrics and melodies and songs and chords and production that to me stood out. She worked with both male and female artists. She really knew how to get an artist not only to sing a great song, but to sing very uniquely and in their own way, because she was a great vocal production coach.\n\nMona Scott-Young: She's always listening beyond what we hear. Even if there's a song an artist has [that she’s not involved with], she'll say, \"Yeah, I would have done this thing differently with this artist. Because if you listen to what she did on this one part of the song, you can hear that there's more range there. But for some reason they didn't push her to go there.\" That to me is just one of the things that makes her such a great producer and star finder, because she always is looking for what more they can do and how they can challenge themselves to be better.\n\nEarl Baskerville: She had signed an artist that I used to manage named Mocha. And she told Mocha to go in there and just rap. I think Mocha might have did 30-something bars, 60 bars. know. Missy listened to all of the stuff she did, took it, and dissected it. She went in there and took eight bars, not from the beginning of the track — I don’t know where she found it, in the middle or something — and put it on the Nicole Wray record \"Make It Hot.\" When Mocha comes in, that’s actually the middle of the verse somewhere! That was crazy to me.\n\nHer First Love Was Always Songwriting\n\nThrough it all, Missy’s strength remained (and remains) her songwriting. But what makes her songs stand out, and stand the test of time?\n\nEarl Baskerville: Missy didn’t want to be an artist. She just wanted to be a songwriter.\n\nMerlin Bobb: Her songwriting was very soulful, but it also had great melodic edge to it. They’re very realistic lyrics to a young scene that was happening in R&B and hip-hop at the time. So it was somewhat of a fusion of R&B and hip-hop lyrically, and she just had a very strong sense of melody and great hook lines.\n\nMona Scott-Young: She wasn't talking about the same thing that we were hearing from a lot of the other females in the genre at the time — overt sexuality and material possessions and that kind of stuff. She was engaging, having a good time lyrically, and holding her own with her male counterparts.\n\nShe was giving us music that was great, and it didn't matter that it was coming from a female. She was kind of this androgynous being that was delivering great music. You listen to the song, you just want to party.\n\nRead more: Missy Elliott Makes History As First Female Rapper Nominated For Songwriters Hall Of Fame\n\nShe Changed The Artists Who Came After Her\n\nAs with all major innovations, it didn’t take long after Missy broke big for her influence to be felt.\n\nKathy Iandoli: The special relationship between Aaliyah, Missy, and Timbaland was the fact that together they all created a new sound that would set the standard of hip-hop and what we now define as alt-R&B. They invented a new subgenre. It was something that Missy was able to continue along and then create a sound on her own terms.\n\nGina Thompson: Many people were trying to emulate her whole different style.\n\nLenny Holmes: [Were people copying her?] Most definitely. But there's only one Missy. And I got to say, there’s only one Timbaland too. You hear that trademark voice or the trademark lick, and you just know that's them.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: I think she influenced just about everybody that came after her. The sound of hip-hop changed after her and Timbaland dropped that music. The way the people produced their drum sounds and their beats, the use of hi hats, it all changed based on Missy and Timbaland.\n\nMerlin Bobb: Most hip-hop/R&B collaborations at that time were hip-hop records with vocal hooks from R&B artists. She kind of flipped it, where she worked from the R&B side and made the vocals and the production more hip-hop friendly.\n\nMona Scott-Young: Her whole existence is based on moving us and influencing us. She wants to be able to touch people. So when we see artists who you can hear or see the influence, then you know that she's done her job.\n\nThere's so many artists — Flyana Boss, a little bit Cardi, a little bit Nicki. They all, I think, have been influenced by Missy, her look, her sound, in one way, shape or form. And that is the greatest compliment, to inspire a generation and see them take what you've done to another level. But then she's constantly also evolving and keeping everyone on their toes.\n\nLearn more: 8 Ways Aaliyah Empowered A Generation Of Female R&B Stars\n\nConsidering Missy And Her Legacy\n\nEveryone interviewed for this piece had so much love for Missy. Here’s a small sample.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: Missy is one of the most professional, talented, creative artists I've ever had the luck to work with. I'm happy to see that she is being recognized for being the icon that we all saw that she was becoming back then.\n\nLenny Holmes: Even today, in whatever we're doing, we use what we've learned from Missy Elliott. It’s mixed in whatever we do. It’s amazing what she has done for herself, but she has definitely helped people along the way, and we will forever be grateful to her.\n\nDigital Black: She's a one-of-one, God-given talent. She earned every award, every accolade, accomplishment. Her work ethic was phenomenal, and nothing was given. Big sis earned everything, and I just want to say I love her, and it's been a pleasure and an honor to be a part of her career.\n\nKathy Iandoli: There’s so much of the art that we have right now that we have to thank her for.\n\nMona Scott-Young: This has been an incredible journey. I always talk about being incredibly blessed to have had the opportunity to play a role when you have somebody like her who has touched so many people globally and whose music and entire presence hold this special place in fans’ hearts.\n\nEvery day it's just about, how do we continue to push forth, break boundaries, challenge ourselves to do things bigger and better than we did it the last go round.\n\nExplore The Artists Who Changed Hip-Hop\n\nWatch Outkast Humbly Win Album Of The Year For 'Speakerboxxx/The Love Below' In 2004 | GRAMMY Rewind\n\nHow Hip-Hop Took Over The 2023 GRAMMYs, From The Golden Anniversary To 'God Did'\n\n\"From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys,\" Jay-Z rhymes on \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder,\" a prime example of how his eighth LP, The Black Album, is dominated by his rags-to-riches story. Released Nov. 14, 2003, The Black Album was, ironically, intended to be the rapper's final chapter. But the album's remarkable commercial and critical success — it sold 3.5 million copies in the States to become his sixth consecutive number one on the Billboard 200 — instead furthered his magnitude and influence, only continuing his legacy of one of rap's greats.\n\nBoasting no fewer than 12 of the era's hottest producers (The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Timbaland, to name a few), The Black Album is a consistently strong, musically diverse, and remarkably honest listen, which firmly justifies all the self-lionizing. And not only does the album feature Jay-Z's signature tune, it also spawned arguably the most revered mash-up in music — and, among many other feats, inspired a generation of MCs with its slick lyrical flow and ground-breaking beats.\n\nTwenty years on, take a look at eight ways in which Jay-Z's faux-farewell changed the hip-hop game.\n\nIt Spawned The Most Famous Mashup Album Ever\n\nJay-Z practically invited the DJ crowd to put their own spins on The Black Album toward the end of 2004 when he reissued the LP without any beats. Pete Rock, DJ Bazooka Joe, and original contributor 9th Wonder all accepted the challenge. But Danger Mouse, aka one half of soon-to-be chart-toppers Gnarls Barkley, had already taken it on, fusing the rapper's original rhymes with music from another colorful record, The Beatles' White Album.\n\nBringing two pop cultural behemoths together for the first time, The Grey Album (see what he did there) inevitably became a sensation, with EMI's efforts to withhold its release only adding to all the hype. Both Hova and Paul McCartney, however, gave their blessing, with the former telling NPR, \"I think it was a really strong album. I champion any form of creativity, and that was a genius idea to do it. And it sparked so many others like it.\"\n\nIt Put Several Key Names On The Map\n\nJay-Z was no stranger to giving future hip-hop heavyweights their big breaks; both Swizz Beats and Kanye West were virtual unknowns when they contributed to Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life and The Blueprint, respectively. And The Black Album was no different.\n\nProduction team The Buchanans, who'd later work with Lupe Fiasco, Amerie, and Dr. Dre, gained their first official credit on \"What More Can I Say.\" John Legend was still a year away from GRAMMY-winning breakthrough Get Lifted when he co-wrote \"Encore.\" And \"Threat\" helped rap professor (yes, that's a real thing) 9th Wonder to establish himself as a genuine hip-hop authority.\n\nIt Produced His Defining Track\n\nJay-Z had scored, and would go on to score, much bigger hits than \"99 Problems.\" In fact, 24 of his solo singles have charted higher than its No. 30 peak on the Billboard Hot 100. And it isn't always considered to be his best, either: \"Big Pimpin',\" \"Dead Presidents II,\" and \"Where I'm From\" all kept the Rick Rubin production out of the top three in Rolling Stone's recent all-time Hova list. Even so, \"99 Problems\" still has the clout of an undeniably defining tune.\n\nIt's been referenced by everyone from Iggy Azalea to Barack Obama. It gave Jay-Z the first of his four Best Rap Solo Performance GRAMMYs (Mark Romanek's controversial monochrome video also picked up four MTV VMAs). Its themes of racial profiling, police aggression, and gentrification led Jack White to hail it as the modern \"story of America.\" And although Ice Cube said it first, it was undoubtedly Jay-Z who put \"I got 99 problems, but a b— ain't one\" firmly into the hip-hop lexicon.\n\nIt Birthed Rap-Rock's Greatest Crossover\n\nJay-Z certainly wasn't the first hip-hop act to forge an unlikely rock connection. Run-D.M.C. broke down barriers (literally) in the video for their iconic 1986 Aerosmith collaboration \"Walk This Way.\" The '90s saw collabs from KRS-One and Crazy Town (\"B-Boy 2000\"), Method Man and Limp Bizkit (\"N 2 Gether Now\"), and Public Enemy & Anthrax (\"Bring The Noise\"), all of which were met with mixed results. However, the Jigga Man's EP with nu-metalers Linkin Park, 2004's Collision Course, was a different story.\n\nNotching another Billboard 200 No. 1 for both artists, Collision Course proved that rap-rock could be both credible and commercially successful — which eventually helped pave the way for everyone from Lil Uzi Vert to Machine Gun Kelly. And The Black Album was a key part of their success.\n\nNot only did Jay-Z think to do the team-up after seeing the various mash-ups The Black Album spawned, but three of Collision Course's six tracks stem from the LP: \"Points of Authority/99 Problems/One Step Closer,\" \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder/Lying From You,\" and the Best Rap/Sung Collaboration GRAMMY-winning \"Numb/Encore.\"\n\nIt's Been Sampled Countless Times\n\nThe Black Album is built on samples, from the emphatic big beats of Billy Squier to Russell Crowe's dialog from Gladiator. But such is the recyclable nature of hip-hop, it's also been heavily sampled since its 2003 release, too.\n\n\"99 Problems\" alone has been borrowed from or covered at least a recorded 79 times, perhaps most famously on Iggy Azalea's verse in \"Problem,\" her No. 1 hit with Ariana Grande. T.I. brought \"What More Can I Say\" into the top 10 of the Hot 100 after lifting its vocal hook for \"Bring Em Out.\" Hip-hop sibling duo Clipse appear to have been The Black Album's biggest fans, though, having taken lines from \"Public Service Announcement\" and \"Threat\" on \"Number One Supplier\" and \"Where You Been,\" respectively.\n\nIt Pioneered The Hip-Hop Concert Movie\n\nLong before his other half Beyoncé unleashed Homecoming, Jay-Z proved that the concert movie didn't need to be the sole preserve of white guitar acts. Five years after his collaborative Hard Knock Life tour was captured for posterity on Backstage, the rapper invited another camera crew to document what was supposed to be his live swansong. \"The undisputed heavyweight champion of the world in hip-hop,\" welcomes ring announcer Michael Buffer at the start of Fade to Black. And Jay-Z more than justifies such a billing in a dazzling, star-studded set that leaves the 19,000-strong Madison Square Garden crowd hanging on his every word.\n\nJust as compelling is the behind-the-scenes footage of The Black Album's inception, particularly Timbaland and Pharrell Williams' excitement at conjuring the perfect beats. From J. Cole (Forest Hills Drive: Homecoming) to Chance the Rapper (Magnificent Coloring World), a whole host of rappers have since followed suit.\n\nIt Allowed Jay-Z To Guide Other Superstars\n\nThe Black Album might not have been the studio goodbye purported at the time. But before returning with Kingdom Come in 2006, Jay-Z did spend the following three years adhering to The Black Album's retirement theme. The self-imposed hiatus allowed the rapper to explore other creative avenues, expand his brand, and – perhaps most significantly for fans of a certain Barbadian superstar – take the reins of the legendary Def Jam Recordings.\n\nYes, after being appointed to the position of CEO in 2004 by L.A. Reid, Jay-Z signed a then-unknown Rihanna to the label, reportedly responding to her audition with \"There's only two ways out. Out the door after you sign this deal. Or through this window.\" Ne-Yo and Rick Ross were both also plucked from obscurity by the Jigga Man and sent on their paths to stardom during his three years in charge (Jay-Z remained with Def Jam as an artist until May 2009, when he left to concentrate on his own Roc Nation label.)\n\nIt Made Retirement A Marketing Tactic\n\nAlthough Too Short and Master P had both previously reneged on their plans to call it quits, Jay-Z was the first rapper to truly harness the power of an early retirement. Frequently alluding to the news (see \"I supposed to be number one on everybody's list/ We'll see what happens when I no longer exist\" on \"What More Can I Say\"), The Black Album was also accompanied by the aforementioned concert film, a memoir (The Black Book), and ever the entrepreneur, even tie-in sneaker and mobile phones.\n\nHova insists that he really did believe he was bidding farewell at the time, but there's no denying that the announcement helped to both boost his coffers (The Black Album was his biggest selling 2000s release) and add to his mythology. 50 Cent, Waka Flocka Flame, and Lupe Fiasco are just a few of the major hip-hop names who've since made similar claims before quickly walking them back.\n\nSince his return, Jay-Z has added to his legacy in a multitude of ways. He's released collaborative projects with West and Beyoncé; scored a further five solo number one LPs on the Billboard 200 (including The Black Album's unexpected follow-up, Kingdom Come); and added more than a dozen GRAMMYs to his awards haul. And we've not even mentioned the record-breaking world tours, film production credits, and various business interests (TIDAL, Roc Nation Sports) which have helped him become the world's wealthiest rapper with a staggering net worth of $2.5 billion at press time. While The Black Album would've been a remarkable finale, Jay-Z's decision to unretire remains his smartest yet.\n\n50 Artists Who Changed Rap: Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem & More"
