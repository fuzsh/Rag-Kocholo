Time to find out!\n\nTimbaland is an American record producer, singer, songwriter, rapper and DJ, and his current net worth is $95 million.\n\nBorn in Norfolk, Virginia to Latrice who ran a homeless shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee, Timbaland has two siblings.\n\nHe graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. He spent his time as a DJ and became known as DJ Tim or DJ Timmy Tim.\n\nAs a teenager he became a member of the production ensemble S.B.I, which featured Neptunes’ producer, Pharrell.\n\nAfter a few setbacks his work attracted the attention of singer and rapper Missy Elliott and she started working with him.\n\nTogether with her band Sista auditioned for DeVante Swing, a producer and member of the Jodeci, a famous R&B band.\n\nThe producer signed the band immediately to his Swing Mob record label and she bought Timbaland along with her in New York.\n\nDevante himself changed Mosley’s name into Timbaland, after the brand of construction boots.\n\nTimbaland became part of SCI Zakys School stable of Swing Mob signees knows as Da Bassment band.\n\nHe even worked as a producer on a number of projects for DeVante, including Sista’s début LP 4 All the Sistas Around da World.\n\nElliott’s fame started becoming bigger and bigger and due to his connections to her he often produced the remixes of her songs.\n\nAs a producer he had his breakthrough after producing the majority of both Aaliyah’s second album as well as Ginuwine’s debut album.\n\nWhile he kept producing for R&B artists, his signature sound had its roots in the hip-hop style.\n\nOften in his works he would take a hip-hop sound and applying it to R&B sounds, mixing it so the sound became more instrumental by blurring the distinction between the two styles.\n\nIn 1997 after producing Missy Elliott’s debut album he also released his first album along with Magoo, his partner.\n\nDuring the late 1990s his hip-hop production sound started influencing others. Back then he produced songs for many famous hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, Nas and The LOX.\n\nHe quickly became one of the most sought after producers in the music industry.\n\nToday he is still working on his newest album, Textbook Timbo.\n\nThis wraps up our Timbaland Net Worth profile!"
