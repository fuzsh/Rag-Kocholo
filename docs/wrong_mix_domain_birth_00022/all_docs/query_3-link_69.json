        "text": "Producer, rapper Timbaland (born, Timothy Zachery Mosley) has signed to Roc Nation, according to posts on both Roc Nation and Jay-Z’s Life + Times site.\n\n“Roc Nation Welcomes Timbaland To The Family,” reads the caption beneath a photo (above) of Jay-Z and Timbaland in a recording studio on the Life + Times site. The headline above the picture quotes a line from Jay-Z and Timbaland produced, “Hola Hovito”: “And I won’t surrender It With Beats.”\n\nTimbaland, an artist in his own right, is known for his production work with Justin Timberlake, Aaliyah, Missy Elliott and Ludacris among many others. It is unclear in what capacity he will work with Roc Nation, the multi-faceted record label, management company and publishing firm Jay-Z founded in 2008.\n\nJay-Z and Timbaland have a long history of collaboration: The two have worked together since 1998. Timbaland produced tracks on Jay-Z’s “Vol.2… Hard Knock LIfe,” “Vol. 3… Life and Times of S. Carter,” and more. Most recently Timbaland and Jay-Z collaborated on Justin Timberlake’s comeback single “Suit & Tie.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nMore details on the deal will be posted as they become available."
