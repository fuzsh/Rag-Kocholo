        "text": "Fresh off his controversial collaboration with the late rapper Biggie Smalls, which he previewed on Instagram earlier this month, the Grammy-winning music producer Timbaland told Forbes he has a plan to commercialize artificial intelligence software that will revolutionize how songs are made.\n\n“It’s going to really be a new way of creating and a new way of generating money with less costs,” the influential beatmaker told Forbes in an exclusive interview. “I’m already here. This is what I’m doing. I’m going to lead the way.”\n\nTimbaland, born Timothy Mosley, said he believes AI voice filters — which allow an artist to assume the voice of another artist — will open up an unprecedented world of creativity in music. Up-and-coming artists with a good cadence or flow, but not a great voice, could use filters to achieve more success. Established artists will be able to share AI replicas of their voices with each other to test collaborations and save time. And a producer could get exclusive rights to use the voice of “a music legend who’s no longer with us,” he said, and fans will eagerly wait for the project to drop.\n\nMosley said there are a host of legal issues centering on copyright and revenue-sharing to resolve before the future of music can happen, but he’s already got a startup and AI voice filter technology that he wants to sell to usher in the new era.\n\nAI voice filters could have vast implications on how revenue is generated and shared in the $26 billion music industry. They would be a new source of income for the owners of those voices, who could be part of the creation of new material unhampered by death. New pay structures would have to accommodate the fact that a song’s vocal artist could be a machine that mimics a human, and the artistic and financial value of collaborations could hinge on whether an artist lent their real voice or an AI replica.\n\nEarlier this month, Mosley, 51, previewed a song that used AI to recreate the voice of the rapper Biggie Smalls, whose birth name was Christopher Wallace and was also known as the Notorious B.I.G. The Brooklyn-based Smalls is still revered as one of the giants of rap, and his shooting death in March 1997 was a watershed moment in the history of American music. Mosley’s post, which seemed to resurrect the rapper, drew a wide range of responses, from fire emojis to users saying, “Nah, this ain’t it.”\n\nMosley said it was time to go public with a project that solves AI that he’s been working on for a while. “I got a solution — I’ve been working on it — that’s going to be beneficial to everyone,” he told his 3.9 million Instagram followers on May 2. “In the meantime … I always wanted to work with Big, but I never got a chance to — until today. It came out right.”\n\nThe person behind the Biggie AI voice filter was Michael S. Wilson II, a rapper also known as The Mike Wilson. Wilson told Forbes that he’s open to being the voice behind Biggie or other artists, once ethics around AI music are established. “It’s not something that I’m opposed to,” he said. “I wouldn’t want to be known solely for it, of course.”\n\nAI-generated songs have been proliferating across the internet lately, driven by content creators using open-source AI models to put the voices of popular artists on songs they never made. One of the most notable examples so far was the April 4 release of “Heart on my Sleeve,” which used the vocal likenesses of Drake and The Weeknd and sent Universal Music Group on a fierce campaign to have streaming platforms pull it down.\n\nBut the quality of most AI voices has been amateurish, Mosley said, and it’s not being done in a way that would make artists and record labels feel proud to be involved. He said he believes the industry and consumers need to see high-grade voice filters, human involvement and a verification system that shows the AI voice was authorized. “I don’t want to be afraid of what’s going on,” Mosley told Forbes. “I want to be the guy to figure out a solution.”\n\nMosley said he doesn’t plan to release the Biggie-voiced song — at least not without the permission of the late rapper’s estate — but he does intend to commercialize the voice filter software that helped create it. The software was developed by Light Energy Labs, a Miami-based company Mosley cofounded in 2022 with software programmer and producer Zayd “Creatrgod” Portillo. Those two, working with another programmer, have been refining the filter for more than two years. Mosley said only recently did they get it to a point where the output was of high enough quality to use in a song.\n\nEverybody has the same open-source tools, Portillo told Forbes. “It comes down to what you’re putting into it, like proprietary datasets.”\n\nIt’s an exciting time to be an investor in AI music, said Landon Campbell, a general manager with venture-funding firm Drive Capital. Campbell said he’s interested in AI startups that can help studios or labels operate better, but he said issues related to copyright and intellectual property will likely be a headwind for startups that directly touch AI-generated music. “I think there are some use cases for AI tools specifically that are helping artists make sure that their voices aren’t on songs that they didn’t approve of and finding a better way to track that,” he said.\n\nMosley said his AI voice filter product has not yet been named, and for competitive reasons he declined to discuss his go-to-market plans. This is not Mosley’s first entrepreneurial endeavor. At the onset of the pandemic he partnered with Swizz Beats to launch live music competition platform VERZUS, which they later sold to Triller Network for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs Timbaland, he’s worked with a vast swath of the who’s who of contemporary music, including Jay-Z, Madonna, Missy Elliott, Shakira, Aaliyah, Rihanna, Nas, Justin Timberlake, Ludacris, Drake and 50 Cent. And now, in a way, Biggie.\n\nMosley said part of his motivation for embracing AI voice filters so early is because Black America far too often isn’t represented in the bounty of wealth that comes with creating or investing in technologies that end up changing the world.\n\n“We’re the culture man, so I at least got to come in the door,” he said. “Usually someone else gets to it and it blows up.”"
