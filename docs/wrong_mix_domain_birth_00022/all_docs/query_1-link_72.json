        "text": "Taking the name Neptunes, because Neptune rules water and water covers most of the Earth, they began producing their own songs. By the late 1990s, The Neptunes‘ style had crystallized as minimal, staccato electronic tracks. They use the freeze-dried, uninflected tones of the digital era: the snap of drum samples, the blips and tweets of video games, and cell-phone rings. But there’s also a touch of Mr. Riley’s smoothness when Mr. Williams sings airy hooks. In music that can be obsessed with booming bass, The Neptunes sometimes use no bass notes at all; pockets of silence drive the songs as much as the notes they play. “We do skeleton songs,” Mr. Williams said. “We always know when something is too much, we always know when something isn’t enough. And syncopation is essential.”\n\nAlthough Neptunes tracks revel in the mechanization of looped and programmed riffs pumped out by computerized sequencers, they often add an element that sounds winningly askew: the drooping, detuned notes in “I’m a Slave 4 U” or a drum-machine accent that lands just behind the beat. “That’s how music was in the beginning, because it was played by humans,” Mr. Williams said. “A live band would take it all over the place. That’s what makes it hot. Sequencers are perfect, humans are not, and that imperfection is perfection.” The Neptunes are determined not to turn their production into a formula. Mr. Hugo recently had a chameleon tattooed on his right shoulder as a symbol of mutability. “Every artist has a signature sound, just like Van Gogh,” Mr. Hugo said. “We did that in the beginning for people to notice us. It’s like tagging on a subway. But now it’s time to switch it up.”\n\nMr. Williams continued: “If you go back five years to the songs we were doing, they don’t sound like what we’re doing now at all. Gradually we introduce elements to you, and we may use that element in another song, but it’s passed on, it’s not the same thing. It’s like people thinking our house is made of bricks, and it’s not. It starts out brick, but graduates to stone, and it graduates to wood, and it graduates to stucco, and then it graduates to glass, and then it graduates to steel, but the thing is that it’s gradual. Every so often we throw a curveball, and you won’t even know we did it.”\n\nHugo was born in the South Hampton Roads city of Portsmouth, Virginia. He grew up in Virginia Beach; his father is a retired Filipino-American Navy officer while his mother is Filipina. Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo met at the ages of 12 at a summer camp for musicians. The two began working together, mixing beats and playing in various live bands. In 1992, while the two were attending different high schools in Virginia Beach (Hugo at Kempsville High School), Williams was paid to write a verse for the 1992 single “Rump Shaker” by Wreckx-n-Effect.\n\nAfter several years of occasional productions for artists often associated with founder Teddy Riley, such as BLACKstreet and S.W.V., they scored songwriting and production assignments with artists such as Noreaga and Mystikal, which became hits, allowing them to produce with their own distinctive sound for megastars such as Jay-Z. Hugo has been described by The Source Magazine as the “Mr. Spock” to Williams‘ “Captain Kirk,” an analogy that does not sit well with Hugo, as he does not see himself as “stiff” like “Mr. Spock.” However, he does say Williams usually provides the beat (as the drummer of the duo) and most of the melodies to The Neptunes‘ productions, whereas his role lies more as a ‘one man band’ and sequencer.\n\nPharrell was born on April 5, 1973, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, the eldest of three sons born to Carolyn and Pharoah Williams, a schoolteacher and handyman, respectively. At the age of just 12, the aspiring musician started playing with Chad Hugo, a kid he met over summer vacation at band camp. They formed a group called The Neptunes, which was discovered while still in high school by the legendary Teddy Riley, who signed the pair soon after graduation. Since then, Pharrell has embarked on an enviable career, both as a member of The Neptunes, Child Rebel Soldier, and N*E*R*D, and as a solo artist.\n\nFurthermore, the triple Grammy-winner’s singing, performing, and/or producing services have been sought for recordings by everyone from Beyoncé to Jay-Z, Ludacris to Madonna, Mystikal to Lupe Fiasco, Snoop Dogg to Shakira, The Game to J-Lo, Britney Spears to Babyface, Usher to Busta Rhymes, Gwen Stefani to Nelly, P. Diddy to N’ Sync, to Fabolous. As busy as he’s been kept by the entertainment industry, Pharrell still found time to launch the Billionaire Boys Club, a luxury fashion line of clothes and accessories, among other things such as composing music for movies and acting."
