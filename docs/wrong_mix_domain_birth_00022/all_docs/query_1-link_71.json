While Timbaland established himself as a producer, Magoo made his name as a writer for other rap artists such as Missy Elliott and Ginuwine, both contributing their respective skills to Elliott's Supa Dupa Fly and Ginuwine...The Bachelor in the mid 90s. The pair released their first full collaboration Welcome To Our World in 1997, its featured single Up Jumps Da' Boogie climbing into the top 10 of the R&B charts and cementing the popularity of both performers.\n\nMagoo and Timbaland resumed their work together in 1998 on Timbaland's solo record Tim's Bio before releasing a second collaborative effort Indecent Proposal in 2001. Proposal found the duo exploring some unusual production techniques, and also featured one of the last recorded performances by R&B singer Aaliyah on the song I Am Music. A continuation of their musical adventures together was made with 2003's Under Construction Part II, an album that picked up from Timbaland's work on Missy Elliott's Under Construction in 2002.\n\nTimbaland and Magoo Vocalist 1997-present\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Magoo\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
