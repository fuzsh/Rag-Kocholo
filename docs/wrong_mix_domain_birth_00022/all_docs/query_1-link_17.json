A Timberlake country album would make sense, given the fact that he hails from country music's birthplace, Tennessee. And for all the fans who have been tweeting incessantly to try and make it happen, you might be able to rest your thumbs: There are inklings that this whole Justin Timberlake-country thing could become a reality sometime soon. Here is all the evidence laid out... 1. Timberlake recently purchased land right outside of Nashville. Back in July, Timberlake dropped $4 million on property in Leiper's Fork, which is about 30 miles south of Nashville. He could just want to be closer to home and family in Memphis, but this next bit has us thinking otherwise... 2. Timbaland kinda sorta just confirmed they were working on a country project.

Back in July, Timberlake dropped $4 million on property in Leiper's Fork, which is about 30 miles south of Nashville. He could just want to be closer to home and family in Memphis, but this next bit has us thinking otherwise...\n\n2. Timbaland kinda sorta just confirmed they were working on a country project. Timbaland, whose worked alongside Timberlake for a long time as a producer, told TMZ that the two have \"always wanted to do country music.\" \"Are we gonna go country? Well guess what, we are country. He's from Tennessee, I'm from Virginia. It's only right that we try to tap into what we was raised,\" he said recently. Timbaland added that he's \"already posted up in Nashville\"—which adds a new layer of meaning to that land Timberlake just purchased."
