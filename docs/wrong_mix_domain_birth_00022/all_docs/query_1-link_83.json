        "text": "Timbaland: biography\n\nTimothy Zachary Mosley (known as Timbaland) is an American famous record producer, rap musician, songwriter, and DJ.\n\nTimbaland is mostly famous for his songs «Apologize» (feat. One Republic), «Just The Way You Are» (feat. Keri Hilson), «Scream» (feat. Keri Hilson), «Here We Come.» In his career, the musician has collaborated with many outstanding rap representatives, including Swizz Beatz , Veronica, Rihanna, and Drake among others. It’s high time to emerge in Timbaland’s biography!\n\nChildhood and youth\n\nTimbaland was born on March 10, 1972. His birthplace is Norfolk, Virginia, the United States. He is the son of Latrice, who ran a homeless shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. The rapper has a brother Sebastian, who is nine years younger than him and a sister Courtney Rashon, a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. As a kid, Timbaland studied at Salem High School, Virginia Beach, Virginia. He started working as a DJ at an early age and was known under the names DJ Tim and DJ Timmy Tim. As a High School student, Timothy became long-term partners with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. Besides, he became a member of the production ensemble SBI (the abbreviation 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured producer Pharrell Williams. Timothy has famous childhood friends - brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton. That time Timbaland himself began writing lyrics.\n\nAt the age of 14, in 1986, Timbaland was messed up with a crime – he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. So, the musician had to work by the left hand while DJing.\n\nAs a teenager, he was noted by singer and rapper Missy Elliott. Due to DeVante, his new colleague, Timbaland got his nickname. Together they released many projects, such as the 1995 Jodeci LP «The Show», «The After-Party», «The Hotel», and Sista's (unreleased) début «LP 4 All the Sistas Around da World.» Timbaland's popularity started growing up.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2008 Timbaland married Monique Mosley.

However, in divorce papers, Mosley has demanded Timbaland paid for supporting her elder child, arguing that despite the fact that the producer is not the biological father, he has openly claimed the child as his own.\n\nMosley was also requesting payments for life insurance and permanent alimony, among other things. Timbaland has compared Mosley to Aaliyah in the past, saying she bore striking similarities to the deceased singer.\n\nIn his career, Timbaland also Timbaland has had encounters with Karrine Steffans (2003) and Missy Elliott.\n\nOnce in his admissions, Timbaland confessed he had been addicted to drugs.
