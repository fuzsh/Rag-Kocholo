        "text": "In January 1607, the first musical connection with a chess theme occurred. It was called Ballet des Eschecs (Ballet of chess).\n\nFrancois-Andre Danican Philidor (1726-1795) was a famous music composer. He was exposed to chess by the musicians in the French king's court, who played chess during spells of inactivity. At the age of 11 he was composing music for Louis XV. He made an early living by copying music and giving music lessons. In 765 he composed the opera Tom Jones. He wrote over 20 operas in his career. The opera house in Paris has a bust of Philidor.\n\nIn 1809, the first opera with a chess theme was performed. The opera, Das Schachturnier (the chess tournament), was composed by Traugott Maximilian Eberwein (1775-1831). It first appeared in Rudolstadt, Germany.\n\nIn 1836, a musical romance called Zazesizosu! was staged at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in London. One of the songs was called Island of Chess.\n\nFrom 1852 to 1855, Armand Edward Blackmar (1826-1888), of Blackmar-Diemer Gambit fame, was professor of music at Centenary College in Jackson, Louisiana.\n\nIn the 1850s, Paul Morphy (1837-1884) was able to memorize any piece of music after hearing it a single time.\n\nIn the 1860s, Armand Edward Blackmar was the most successful publisher of music of the Confederacy during the Civil War. He was best known for the patriotic songs he wrote for the South. During the Civil War, Armand worked out of New Orleans until a Union raid, led by General Benjamin Butler (1818-1893), on his business forced him to cease working and arrested Blackmar. He was imprisoned by Union soldiers in New Orleans for publishing \"seditious\" (Confederate) music, such as the Bonnie Blue Flag (Band of Brothers) and the Dixie War Song. After the Civil War, he opened up a music store in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1864, Hungarian composer and pianist Ferenc Erkel (1810-1893) was president of the first Hungarian chess organization.\n\nIn the 1870s, chess problemist Sam Loyd (1841-1911) owned a chain of music stores.\n\nIn 1881, there was an article entitled, �Mendelssohn as a Chessplayer,� published in the Chess Player�s Chronicle on November 22, 1881, p. 565. It mentioned that a large part of his time was devoted to chess.\n\nIn the 1880s, Johannes Zukertort (1842-1888) was a music critic and pianist.\n\nIn the 1890s, Sir Walter Parratt (1841-1924) was able to play a Beethoven Sonata at the same time that he was conducting two games of chess blindfold. Parratt was an English organist and composer. He was a member of the Huddersfield Chess Club and played his blindfold games while playing a selection of tunes on the piano at Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire. He served for a few months as president of the Oxford University Chess Club and for two years was captain of the Oxford Chess Club. (source: Shinn, Musical Memory and its Cultivation, 1898, p. 134)\n\nOn January 30-31, 1893, there was a charity musical chess tournament at King�s Lynn in Norfolk, England. The music was composed by Howard Talbot, and rendered by members of the King�s Lynn Musical Society. The performance was attended by the Prince of Wales. (source: British Chess Magazine, March 1893, pp. 135-137)\n\nIn 1900, Russian composer and pianist Alexander Goldenweiser (1875-1961), defeated Mikhail Chigorin in a game of chess, played in Moscow.\n\nIn February 1910, Leevi Antii Madetoja (1887-1947) composed the suite Shakkipeli (Chess Game). It was composed for a play called the Chess Game by Eino Leino (1878-1926).\n\nIn 1911, Russian composer Peter Petrovich Saburov (1880-1932) was President of the St. Petersburg Chess Club.\n\nOn May 20, 1914, composer Sergey Prokofiev (1891-1953) defeated Jose Capablanca in a simultaneous exhibition in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 1918, Peter Saburov was President of the Russian Chess Association.\n\nIn 1925, Russian composer Peter Petrovich Saburov composed �Love Symphony� for a big orchestra.

The song was supposed to be for the musical Funny Face in 1928, but it was not used. It was eventually introduced in the musical Rosalie (1928) by Bobbe Arnst and Mary O�Brian. It has also been performed by Bing Crosby (1955), Ella Fitzgerald (1950), Audrey Hepburn (1957), Louis Armstrong (1957), Carmen McRae (1960), Judy Garland (1961), Andy Williams (1962), Liza Minnelli (1970), Cher (1973), Ray Charles (1973), Carly Simon (2005), and Gloria Estefan (2013).\n\nIn January 1930, the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu (1890-1959) composed the ballet, Echec au Roi (Chess of the King).

Taimanov spent a year learning the violin.\n\nOn June 15, 1937, a 50-minute ballet called Checkmate was performed at the Paris World Exhibition. The ballet was composed by British composer Sir Arthur Bliss (1891-1975) and choreographed by Ninette de Valois (1898-2001), who knew nothing about chess. The ballet was written at the request of the Sadler's Wells Ballet for their visit to Paris in 1937.\n\nIn 1937, composer Sergey Prokofiev and violinist David Oistrakh (1908-1974) played a chess match that was publicized and featured in several Soviet chess magazines of the time. The 10-game match was played at the Master of Art Club in Moscow. Soviet master Vladimir Alatortsev oversaw the match. The winner was awarded the Art Workers� Club prize and the loser had to give a concert for the club members. Prokofiev won the match and Oistrakh went on the concert tour. (source: Silver, �The 1937 Prokofiev-Oistrakh Match,� ChessBase News, Feb 18, 2013)\n\nIn 1939, Melvin �Sy� Oliver (1910-1988) and James �Trummy� Young (1912-1984) wrote the lyrics to ��Tain�t What You Do (It�s the Way That You Do It).� Jimmie Lunceford (1902-1947), Harry James (1916-1983), and Ella Fitzgerald (1917-1996) recorded the jazz tune. One of the lines is �I must confess, that life is like a game of chess.� In 1982, the jazz tune was transformed into a pop song by Fun Boy Three and the Bananarama. In 1988, it appeared in Bananarama�s Greatest Hits Collection.\n\nIn 1941, American violinist and pianist Louis Persinger (1887-1966) won the first USCF Open postal chess tournament.\n\nIn 1943, John Cage (1912-1992) wrote an unfinished piano sonata called Chess Pieces. This composition was originally conceived as an ink-and-gouache on masonite painting, created specifically for �The Imagery of Chess� exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York City (1944-45). This was an exhibition that was comprised of works that were in some manner related to Marcel Duchamp's interest in chess. In 2005, the original painting resurfaced, and, in working to realize it as a musical composition, Mararet Leng Tan discovered it to be a coherent composition � a through-composed score, consisting of 22 systems of music read conventionally from left to right. Each system is a self-contained musical unit of 12 bars, translating collectively into 22 modular segments. Leng Tan subsequently recorded the work, and thus it was both exhibited and heard within the context an exhibition entitled �The Imagery of Chess Revisited� at The Noguchi Museum in Long Island City, New York (21 October 2005 � 16 April 2006). The original score, as visual artwork, remains in a private collection in Chicago.\n\nIn 1944, Vittorio Rieti (1898-1994) composed Chess Serenade: suite for two pianos, four hands.

The two composed that national anthem of East Germany. (source: Life, Nov 24, 1947, p. 148)\n\nIn 1948, Vasily Smyslov (1921-2010) wanted to become a professional baritone singer and took singing and music lessons.\n\nIn 1950, Vasily Smyslov failed an audition with the Bolshoi Theatre, and only then decided to make chess a career.\n\nIn 1951, Count Giancarlo dal Verme (1908-1985) and FIDE Vice President Marcel Berman (1895-1960) composed the music of the FIDE anthem.\n\nIn 1953, the first ballet on ice with a chess theme was performed.

There are references to a chess knight, Paladin�s calling card.\n\nHave gun will travel reads the card of a man\n\nA knight without armor in a savage land\n\nHis fast gun for hire heeds the calling wind\n\nA soldier of fortune is a man called Paladin\n\nPaladin Paladin where do you roam Paladin Paladin far far from home\n\nHe travels on to wherever he must\n\nA chess knight of silver is his badge of trust\n\nThere are campfire legends that the plainsmen sing\n\nOf a man with the gun of the man called Paladin\n\nPaladin Paladin where do you roam Paladin Paladin far far from home\n\nFar far from home far far from home\n\nOn January 13, 1964, Bob Dylan (1941- ) released his album The Times They Are a-Changin.� One of the songs, �Only a Pawn in Their Game,� has the line, �But he can�t be blamed, He�s only a pawn in their game.� The song is more of a chess metaphor than actually about chess.\n\nIn 1964, Calvin Barry Blocker (1955- ) of Cleveland was considered a music prodigy.
