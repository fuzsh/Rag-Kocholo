        "text": "info_outline Episode 182 : The People's Music\n\nEpisode 182 : The People's Music \"I never did a dance for a dollar...\" - Buckshot This month we don't shift into high gear in terms of tempo at any point, topping out at around 90, so those of you experiencing actual summer don't overheat! We've got some absolutely fire new releases in the mix alongside some versions that you might never have heard, plus some deep album cuts. We start things off with just such a track - if you don't own the album, I'd be willing to bet you've never heard it...never let it be said this is a show that leans on the obvious records! Still to see Phat Kat at The Hip Hop Chip Shop on August 4th, plus me playing a special Detroit warmup set! Mastodon : Twitch : Playlist/Notes Above The Law ft. Kokane : Rain Be For Rain Bo RIP KMG, who passed away twelve years ago this month. In a season where we maybe haven't had the sunshine we expected, this seemed like an appropriate choice - a downtempo but funky piece from the well-respected LP \"\", Above The Law's third. Cold 187um not only produced the track but also provides the scene-setting first verse, while his cousin Kokane is on the hook, and KMG's second verse builds on the perfect setup. A lot of people were not ready to when it came out, but if you have time to take a front-to-back listen, especially if you appreciate the West Coast sound, then do - you'll be rewarded. Tavaras Jordan : Change, Pt. 2 (The Last Thing) A beautifully smooth instrumental from this talented Hip-Hop and R&B producer out of North Carolina, taken from his short - but very sweet - 2019 \"\" album. Anything with this man's name on is worth a listen! GZA : Animal Planet The streets are a jungle, and nature is gangster. Another in GZA's series of themed tracks that started with \"\" on \"\", this grand-sounding Bink and Tyquan Walker-produced cut from \"\" allows the Genius to demonstrate once again how he can build a concept track like few others. Jay-Z ft. Damian Marley : Bam One of my good friends always plays this track before job interviews, because these people have to \"know who they F'in with\", to quote Jay-Z! This collaboration with Damian Marley from the \"\" LP is one of my personal highlights of that release, and the producer No I.D. goes straight to a reggae classic to provide the raw material, the mighty \"\" by . Black Moon : General Feva The \"\" album, Black Moon's first after a sixteen-year layoff, seemed to go under-appreciated by many, but I for one was very pleased to see the Brooklyn legends release that LP in 2019. Da Beatminerz on production of course, for some slow, loping boom-bap that is a little dark for summer perhaps, but perfect for this slide towards some sandpaper-type roughness. Cut Beetlez x Bronx Slang : I'm Not Chillin If the last track was raw, this is the cow still wandering around in the field! Finland's Cut Beetlez production team linked up with the always-NY Bronx Slang for a , from which this is the title cut. As soon as Jerry Beeks told me it was out I had it in my headphones and even after repeated listens, I knew this was the track to go with right here! The sonics snarl, thump, and grind, and yet you can hear every word from the MCs, who just seem to keep getting better with time and can give you the business regardless of the pace of the track. [J-Zone] Al-Shid : Fight Club (Instrumental) He may be a full-time and high-quality now, but I'll always remember the originality J-Zone brought to Hip-Hop production for so many years. There's no-one who sounded quite like him, and this instrumental of a from Al-Shid's is a great example - some might say quirky, but in terms of quality, very serious. Conductor Williams & Boldy James : Flying Trapeze Act Too many people think that street rap and lyrical creativity can't go together, but this song from the \"\" LP by Kansas City producer Conductor Williams and Detroit's Boldy James, thankfully still with us after a , have both in spades. The Conductor's track clearly treats its original sample in a pretty extreme fashion (you can hear the warbling which the processing likely introduced) but then adds the subtlest of kick-snare to quietly drive it along, and the vocals left in just add extra soulful flavour beneath Boldy's voice. As he moves between straight description, metaphor, and simile - especially the last punchy one in the hook that gives the track its title - Boldy James puts in excellent work. El Michels Affair ft. Raekwon : The PJs (Instrumental/Vocal) I needed to lead with the instrumental just to provide a nice bridge in, but it's always a pleasure to hear the brilliant El Michels Affair play! This is a re-recording of the track \"\" from Pete Rock's 2008 LP \"\" - no Masta Killa this time, but Raekwon returns to do his verses over with some small changes. El Michels Affair, in turn, base their instrumental performance around the way Pete Rock worked the original sample, but with some subtle flourishes. \"\" is a 12\" single well worth adding to your collection. Da Beatminerz ft. Black Moon : Anti Black Moon again, because why not? This time we go with their appearance on the new Da Beatminerz project \"\" (bearing in mind that Evil Dee of Da Beatminerz is also an actual member of the group) for one of the highlights of the LP. Over a slow, reflective, almost funereal take on the groove best known from Souls of Mischief's \"\", Buckshot speaks on his journey as an independent artist and label owner (Duck Down) in a straightforward manner while maintaining that trademark flow. To maintain a thirty-plus year independent career through the changes in the industry is quite a feat - salute. O.C. : This Is Me This is a track I've always enjoyed, but which I think escaped a lot of people's notice. A selection from the overlooked \"\" LP, O.C.'s fifth, it's a track where he speaks on his career-long determination to follow his own path and ignore the trends - in fact, it's spiritually very close to the Beatminerz/Black Moon track that precedes it here. Mike Loe takes a late-70s soul sample, turns the speed up a touch and provides an excellent musical backdrop for the lyrics. MF DOOM : Dead Bent (Original 12\" Instrumental) If you know the \"\" LP but not this, it would sound like an overstatement to say that the on the album is a \"refined\" version of anything, as rough-and-ready as the whole release is, but you can hear that this original is even more beautifully unpolished. Self-produced by the late great DOOM, you can find this not only on the original 12\" mentioned in the title, but also on some later versions of the album, containing alternate versions, B-sides, and instrumentals - essential for the DOOM fan. Dubbul O & Cutterz : Stay Gold Stellar new release out of Manchester, with this familiar duo (and half of Voodoo Black) headlining their new with this title track. If you've lost someone close, this one will hit you hard, with Dubbul O's deeply personal lyrics coming through strong over Cutterz' production which is somehow both optimistic and moody at the same time. Definitely check for that five-track EP. Mecca:83, Phat Kat, and Guilty Simpson : Don't Stop Exclusive! *Sounds airhorn* Manchester's own blessed me with a copy of this as-yet unreleased track, with his warm and bumping production backing up two giants of the Detroit scene, Phat Kat and Guilty Simpson. Two cities famous for their industries come together for a great musical union! Dilated People : The Main Event I'll be honest - of the three tracks on the classic underground \"Work The Angles\" , this is the one I play the least, but the Alchemist-produced middle track on the release (also on 2000's \"\" LP) definitely deserves respect. Rakaa Iriscience steps all the way back here and makes space for Evidence to get busy on both verses. The samples of some of the Hip-Hop greats for the hook rounds off the whole package nicely. Nas & Statik Selektah : Dead Presidence (That's not my spelling, it's what they printed on the labels of \"\"!) Jay-Z and Ski famously sampled the \"\" line from Nas' \"\" for \"\" on the classic \"\", but on this track Statik Selektah reverses the game and blends the vocals from the Nas track with Ski's instrumental, and while the original is a flawless cut, these two pieces do fit together beautifully as well. Marco Polo : Ps & Qs (Remix Instrumental) MPC magic from Marco Polo, from in the \"Baker's Dozen\" producer series, with clean drums, a live-sounding bass, and guitar licks placed to perfection. Camp Lo ft. Jungle Brown : Hold On I've always loved the way this track ends, and as such thought it needed to be played in a position where that portion can be heard uninterrupted. It's not just the closing track here but also the finisher on the 2009 \"\" album. Jungle Brown is one of the few MCs to make repeated features with the Lo, and he does his thing alongside the legendary Sonny Cheeba and Geechi Suede while also co-producing it with Apple Juice Kid. If you're a fan of the group, definitely seek out this release as there are some absolute heaters on there, including the back-to-back of \"\" and \"\". Please remember to support the artists you like! The purpose of putting the podcast out and providing the full tracklist is to try and give some light, so do use the songs on each episode as a starting point to search out more material. If you have Spotify in your country it's a great way to explore, but otherwise there's always Youtube and the like. Seeing your favourite artists live is the best way to put money in their pockets, and buy the vinyl/CDs/downloads of the stuff you like the most! /episode/index/show/airadam/id/32239467\n\ninfo_outline Episode 181 : Still Rollin'.\n\nEpisode 181 : Still Rollin'. \"Come on and give me my props...\" - Diamond Fifteen years! We started this ride in June 2009 and here we still are all these years later. Thank you so much for your support, and I hope you'll stay with me for as long as I'm able to keep putting these shows together. The point of this podcast has never been to prioritise new releases, or to only ever look to the past, but a blend of the two. With that in mind, this month's mix certainly has some old personal favourites, a sprinkling of new music, and some obscurities and rarities! Listen, enjoy, and please do spread the word as widely as you can - as I always say, I have a lot of things, but no advertising budget 😆 I was racking my brain trying to come up with cover art that would reference the theme of fifteen...then realised that the infamous \"4, 5, 6\" combination sums up to that very number! Mastodon : Twitch : Events : Playlist/Notes The Thryday : Fantastic The is only on the second-hand market, but at least I had this from an old mixtape (\"WJLR Radio, Volume 1\") to share with you! The Dutch master is on production for this North Carolina group who were part of the Justus League family and appreciated by those in the know. This same beat, with the same name, is also on Nicolay's \"City Lights\" and the \"\" version, but with the rhymes that elevate it so...much harder to get! [J Dilla] Jaylib : The Red (Instrumental) You already know! One of the best-loved instrumentals from Dilla's post-Slum career - certainly if the reaction when I drop it in a set is anything to go by - and one that will move your speakers for sure. The original is from the famed \"Champion Sound\" collaboration between Dilla and Madlib, where each rhymes over the other's production, and now the full set of instrumentals is available, making the a 100% must-own. Jigmastas ft. Mos Def, Mr. Complex, Pharoahe Monch, Shabaam Sahdeeq, and Talib Kweli : Lyrical Fluctuation Remix This is a true all-star MC roster from the late 90s-early 00s independent scene, with DJ Spinna of Jigmastas on remix duties, bringing a different vibe to Joc Max's , based on crazy short chops of a classic soul sample and having them cheerfully bounce along. I only got this in the last few weeks, but have already played it on Twitch, digitised it, and am now sharing its eternally-fresh energy here! Ghostface ft. Wigz : Outta The Way \"...in the gym throwing the dumbbells all out of order\" - disgraceful conduct... Another usage of the same sample from the \"Lyrical Fluctuation\" remix, this Anthony Acid beat is more straightforward, with Ghostface and Wigz busting through with the energy of two guys rushing a bank! This was one of the standouts on the 2005 Ghostface and Trife \"\" LP, though not released as a single despite the potential. Mobb Deep : Feel My Gat Blow The to the Saul Williams-starring \"\" was very much a mixed bag in the vein of many 90s-00s soundtracks, but certainly had a few standouts and otherwise-unreleased cuts from some greats, of which this is one. Havoc's beat sounds like a mix between a medieval court and 90s NYC, and the lyrical content is trademark Mobb. Redman : Winicumuhround As much as I love Redman's \"\" album (which, notably, ), I had all but forgotten about this track until I pulled the vinyl out for a front-to-back listen recently. Erick Sermon and Redman combine on production to have this one thump along with a killer bassline-lead track, and Red is in fine form on the mic. With the voice of the late Hurricane G appearing as part of the densely-packed hook, this is a Def Squad heater for sure. Pete Rock : Death Becomes You Definitely one of my favourite Pete Rock beats of all time, but we had to wait a long time to get an instrumental! The was on the for the 1993 classic \"\", but it wasn't until the 2019 release of Pete Rock's \"\" album that we got this version. Absolutely flawless in the sense that there's not a single thing, as a listener or a DJ, that I would have wanted him to change. Roots Manuva ft. Big P, Blackitude, Fallacy, Rodney P, Skeme : Witness The Swords I'd be willing to bet that while most listeners, especially in the UK, will be very familiar with the classic Roots Manuva single \"\", most won't know this! It's a blend of the lyrics from \"\" from Roots' second LP \"\" and the \"Witness\" beat, from the same album. As far as I know, the only place to find this one is the 2002 \"\" compilation on Big Dada Records, which is worth picking up for some quality UK cuts. Big Boi ft. Cutty : Shutterbugg As a photographer, I really should dig this one out more! Big Boi co-produces with Scott Storch on this single from his solo debut \"\", which was actually a much bigger hit in the UK than in the US, where it somehow didn't even break the top 50 in the R&B charts. It's a hectic-sounding track which unexpectedly takes a sudden quiet break in the second verse - and it's at that point that we move along... Stro Elliot : Soul II Stro ...and so we move with a quick transition into another track that not just references but heavily samples the classic \"\" by the UKs own Soul II Soul, a Stro Elliot workout that's just undeniable in its groove. The samples of Caron Wheeler's vocals haunt at times before coming firmly into the foreground, while the drums and bass thump along with an accompanying keyboard line. That Stro Elliot sampled that 1989 classic on his twenty-seven years later is a testament to the power of the original. Kokane ft. Lil Half Dead : Ghetto Music When I saw the garage-filmed (high-quality though!) for this, I kept waiting for the rapping to start - but nope, this is just a funk product from start to finish which, as the track says, will make you want to move! Despite \"\" only being released in 2022, it was apparently recorded back in the early 00s while Kokane was working on Dr. Dre's \"2001\" LP but shelved for over twenty years. It manages to sound vintage P-funk, 90s G-Funk, and modern all at the same time. is a real \"if you know, you know\" artist who has been putting in work for many years, has collaborated with almost everyone you can name, and keeps on bringing the heat! [Erick Sermon] Tha Truth : Red Lights (U Gotz 2 Chill '96) (instrumental) If you know me, you know I love Zapp and Roger Troutman, which means that EPMD's classic \"\" single is a firm favourite. On this R&B from Tha Truth, who only released one album back in 1997, they came out of the gate strong with Erick Sermon on production, reprising his sampling of \"\" and even throwing in the \"chill\" sample from his original beat. Shout out to DJ Melo D of Beat Junkies, who was the only person I've heard playing this and the one who told me (on Twitch) what it was! Diamond D, Sadat X, and Lord Finesse : You Can't Front A great album cut, loved by those in the know, taken from the early 90s classic \"\". Buckwild and Diamond's production is both clean and still vintage SP-era magic, with Diamond also grabbing the mic to spit a verse between two other greats. Sadat X was the perfect choice to go first, with his unique tone drawing you in immediately, and Lord Finesse brings it home strong. Common : Dreamin' For those that have missed the early chatter, here's a sample of the upcoming , which promises to channel the specific forms of energy that each artist brought to their 90s work. If this beautifully-produced tale of a dream of a walk with Black greats both living and transitioned is anything to go by, we're in for a treat! The Kid Daytona : Fly Lullaby A deep cut from the 9th Wonder production discography, working with a loop that Pete Rock teased us with between tracks on \"\". The Kid Daytona is definitely a grown man now, but this was an early release from the Bronx native on his \"\" mixtape from 2010 - where every track sampled some kind of intro or interlude from another Hip-Hop track. This is exactly the kind of overlooked track I like to throw in for anyone who might have missed it! Dogg Pound ft. Snoop Dogg, RBX, and The Lady Of Rage : Who Da Hardest? A grand reunion - would have left it to the last song as it is on the new Dogg Pound \"\" album, but it fit so well here sonically that I changed my mind! For a coming together of West Coast legends, the biggest surprise is them bringing DJ Premier in on production, and maybe the most welcome is the featuring of The Lady of Rage, who has been a universally-loved MC since her star turn on \"\". It's pretty long, but there's no instrumental outro and I didn't want you to miss out any of the MCs, so you get the whole thing here! Terrace Martin & James Fauntleroy : Butterfly Effect \"Gotta stop taking life advice from songs\" - I'd say that was good advice, but then that's also what you might call a circular problem! We go fully chill at the end of this section, with the undeniable and unmistakable voice and vocal production of James Fauntleroy alongside modern jazz legend Terrace Martin with a track from their joint \"\" EP. Marco Polo : Yung Feathers The man from Toronto with a trademark bit of modern boom-bap on this final instrumental, a track from his \"\" release, a great pickup for anyone who appreciates good Hip-Hop production. M-Beat ft. Nazlyn : Sweet Love A big switch-up to end the episode, with a vintage - a jungle remake of Anita Baker's 1986 classic \"\" with Nazlyn on vocals. Even as someone who didn't like jungle when it first emerged, I couldn't deny this one, an absolute classic reworking. I understand it actually sold well - hitting a high of no.18 in the charts back in 1994 - which goes to show that just sometimes, the public at large catches on to some real quality. Please remember to support the artists you like!

It's been a good month for shows, with a highlight being seeing Edo G live for the first time, so I've included a couple of his tracks alongside some recent releases, a rarity or two, and some bonafide old classics. The show is a touch longer than usual, running a little over an hour, but hopefully it still flies by for you! Mastodon : Twitch : Playlist/Notes Edo G, DJ Yoda, and Brad Baloo : Talk About It Coming off the back of seeing a great performance by Edo G and DJ Yoda at The Hip-Hop Chip Shop in Manchester this month, I thought we'd start the episode with a smooth selection from their new \"\" EP. Edo G is in his grown man rap bag on a Brad Baloo beat, with Yoda on the cut - and if the record he's cutting is what I think it is, then that's an A1 selection. Visoneers : Swahililand I finally got round to digitising the \"\" , a by Marc Mac's Visioneers project that features tributes to the Hip-Hop side of his influences, and notably contains several cover versions of famously-sampled tracks, of which this is one. This is a beautiful version of a track by the late great jazz pianist and composed Ahmad Jamal, which eventually breaks out into the part most people will recognise - the mighty chords sampled from the Jamal version by J Dilla for De La Soul's \"\". DJ Spinna ft. Dynas : More Grab the \"\" album by Spinna if you see it - it's no longer on streaming services and with it also not being available on Bandcamp, picking up a physical copy is the only way to secure yourself a copy of this really high-quality album. In the meantime, take this slice, with Spinna coming with his trademark synth bass as the centre of the instrumental, and Miami's Dynas, a longtime collaborator, spitting a positive message on the mic. Buscrates ft. Soraya Watti : On My Way It was great to hear play this track during a DJ set on Twitch recently while Soraya Watti was actually in the chat - the love she was getting was beautiful. This warm, bassy, soulful cut is the closer on last year's \"\" LP, a triumph from the Pittsburgh synth maestro. Curren$y ft. Freddie Gibbs : Stash House Eighties vibes here on the production, with 808-Ray going style on the main sample and then adding his drum track to it. Curren$y fills this lane extremely well, as he uses his trademark relaxed flow to liken the dope stuff being exported out of his studio to...well, actual dope...while guest Freddie Gibbs just jumps straight out of the analogies and into the street for real. This is from the \"\", which was one of - he might sound relaxed enough to be able to fall off the floor, but he's one of the most prolific MCs of his generation. Fat Pat : Tops Drop RIP Fat Pat, the creator of a true Southern classic that just overflows with good vibes! J Slash on production brings in the bassline groove from an 80s soul classic on this track from Pat's debut \"\", and the lyrics are just about the joys of stunting in a nice convertible. This still gets plenty of play to this day on its home turf, and the youngsters at University of Houston basketball games hear it as the team's theme music - even though it was released before they were born! Ilajide : Number One The exact flavour of banging beat we've come to expect from Detroit's Ilajide, with the drums smacking, the main sample stuttering and the bass coming in strong to undergird it all. I might need to go and find/buy the original sample, which plays for a few seconds quietly at the very end, but you can find this track and some other excellent work on the \"\" album. Declaime : Exclaim The Name A track with a bump so urgent it almost feels like it's tripping over itself (courtesy of Kankick), this is quality turn of the century underground business out of Oxnard, California from the 2001 \"\" LP. Declaime is perhaps better known to many as Dudley Perkins - especially if you follow the Stones Throw label - and while he can sing, don't get confused and think his bars aren't tough. Semi Six : 24K Rap One thing about a Semi Six record is that you rarely get a long and clear intro, which might not be ideal for us DJs but shows how eager he is to get on and demolish the track! It's fitting that he mentions Raekwon here, as the track draws its title from that Rae and Havoc did with J Dilla that came out on the 2009 posthumous LP \"\". AntBell! produces , while Semi delivers, as promised, the golden era rhymes he mentions in the hook. Edo G ft. Krumb Snatcha and Jaysaun : Stop Dat Pure Boston on the mic here, with the message from all the MCs being an emphatic recommendation to stay true to yourself rather than putting out a false image - one that at best is an embarrassment, and at worst a safety risk. Pete Rock's beat smacks without overly dominating, leaving space for you to understand every single word. The place to find this is the \"\" album, which has been re-released digitally in recent years with the instrumentals for every track bundled in, making it a true Hip-Hop DJ jewel. De La Soul : Big Mouf A bit of an obscurity for you! \"\" was a collaboration between De La and Nike (yes, the shoe company) that was intended to be part of a series of albums as soundtracks for runners. The whole thing is a largely continuous mix, and has some really good tracks that even dedicated De La fans might not know! This particular track is a heavy Dave West production with an incredibly long intro before the lyrics properly kick in - that isn't me cutting it back and forth or extending it, the original sounds like that. You might struggle to find this one - I don't think it's on any of the streaming services or download stores, and the 2009 vinyl that I got at the time only pops up for sale occasionally. DJ Nu-Mark ft. Full Crate : Pass The Courvoisier Another cover version, this time of a Pharrell-produced , which was a highlight of the 2021 \"\" album - a full version excursion from a DJ known best as part of Jurassic 5. Nu-Mark links up with Full Crate, a producer from Armenia via the Netherlands, for a horn-laden track that could almost make you believe that it's an old original that the Busta record was reworking! James Brown : Don't Tell A Lie About Me And I Won't Tell The Truth On You Topical 😆 A slice of funk from \"\", The Godfather's thirty-eighth studio album, released back in 1974. You may well recognise this title as it was borrowed almost word-for-word for a recent lyric! [Easy Mo Bee] Termanology : It's Time This is the tasty, but extremely short, beat that opens up Term's \"\" LP, produced by the great Easy Mo Bee. I'd almost forgotten about it, but it provides a nice bridge into the next cut... Portishead : Strangers There's not much I can say about the brilliant Portishead debut album \"\" that hasn't been said by full-time writers, so just take it from me - it's a must-listen. Beth Gibbons' voice is processed here as though it's coming from a recording decades older, and the union of that and that heavy production was highly innovative at the time. Chalk : Stay With Me This month we were treated to a new release by Manchester artist Chalk that has been four years in the making, a real labour of love. His new LP \"\" is a film noir-influenced instrumental album, a soundtrack to a film that doesn't exist - think of a darker, more vintage take on Prince Paul's \"\" without any MCs. It's best appreciated over the full length of its sixteen tracks, but this is a nice sample of what you can expect. When I played this track on a recent stream, at least a couple of people immediately said that it reminded them of DJ Shadow's \"\" - high praise indeed. Planet Asia : Place Of Birth I can't remember where I first heard this, but it was probably an underground mixtape somewhere, and it reminds me of the kind of thing I often used to end up buying when I was supposed to be shopping for tracks for a club night! Planet Asia is a veteran MC out of Fresno, California, and was a fine one as just the second release in his career. He gets a big assist here from two-thirds of Cali compatriots Dilated Peoples - Evidence's beat is dark and fairly sparse, with cuts adding extra texture in the hooks, intro, and outro. Evil Needle ft. Venuz Beats : Dive Evil Needle is becoming a favorite instrumental producer of mine, and together with Venuz Beats he brings us a heavy-bottomed yet floaty head-nodder which you can find on the \"\" EP - well worth picking up just for this one. UGK : Ridin' Dirty Finishing up with another Southern classic, another car themed track, but a world away from the celebratory air of \"Tops Drop\". As funky and mellow as the late Pimp C's is, this is lyrically dark and paranoid - but as a wise man once said, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you. The \"they\" in this case are the police and their informants, the natural enemies of anyone riding in a car carrying something that they legally shouldn't be... This is the title track from , and a perfect example of what Pimp C's stepfather meant when advised his son to \"put some music into\" his Hip-Hop - the multi-instrumentalist was a master at bringing that live feel to his work in a way that ensures it hasn't dated a day.

Rest in peace to all, and thanks to them for all their contributions. Despite spending a fair amount of time (and £) digging in the vintage crates this month, the selection is mostly a mix of exploring my existing colllection, plus a few new brand new digital releases. I will be very impressed if there's anyone who knows every track here already! Mastodon : Twitch : - see upcoming schedule @ Playlist/Notes MysDiggi : Skull Island It was a pleasure to hear the well-respected UK MC MysDiggi explain some of his approach to writing and maintaining a career at the Hip-Hop @ 50 event at the Contact Theatre in Manchester recently, and so I wanted to include a track from him on this episode! On this track from \"\", he's in full King Kong mode over an 8-bit-style beat from Manchester's Twizted Roots (now ) that has demolished the room when he's played it at the producer sessions. A perfect union for a literally monster tune! [Dabrye] Bus : Keep Life Right Remix (Instrumental) Bass and more bass, following up with another that was very popular in Manchester on the underground scene in the early nineties. The vocal version has lyrics by Scottish MC Soom-T, and if you go all the way back to you can hear it there - though of course, if you like it, I recommend ! Sparkz : Buzzin Last year's \"\" EP by Manchester's Sparkz was a great release on High Focus records, with five tracks entirely produced as well as written by the man himself - and with a touch not seen nearly enough these days, all the instrumentals coming included as well! This is the opener and probably my favourite, with a nice relaxed bounce to the rhythm and the lyrics flowing over nice and easy...until he ramps it up with some devastating double-speed bars! I don't know if any of the vinyl copies of this are still available, but it's on Bandcamp so you can pick it up for yourself there. OutKast : Elevators (ONP 86 Mix) Of course there had to be some this month, and so I've gone back to what is still my favourite OutKast LP (\"\") for the remix of the lead single. It retains some of the same spooky keys as the OutKast-produced but overall swaps elements out for something more of a live feel, you could say - almost like a funk band putting their own spin on it. Cookin Soul & The Musalini ft. Planet Asia : I Want It All Mus has been cultivating his New York take on the \"gentleman of leisure\" lane, and this luxurious track is a standout on the newly-released \"\" album, with Valencia's hooking up an Anita Baker sample for a short and sweet cut, with both Mus and guest Planet Asia cooking (no pun intended) up visions of fly living, with those sounding good right about now... Z-Ro ft. Mya : Clearer This has been a track on repeat for me this month, great track from Rother Vandross' new \"\" LP. He's never really made a mainstream splash, but those who know him have no choice but to appreciate and respect him. Getting the legendary Mya to feature here was a big win, and Beanz & KornBread on production beautifully interpolate a Houston classic for a sparkling clean track perfect for when the sun does eventually appear! DJ DMD : 25 Lighters (Instrumental) I was utterly amazed to find out that I'd never played any version of on the show before, but with the preceding tune drawing heavily from this Houston anthem, I had to drop the instrumental at least. DJ DMD sampled the classic \"\" by Al B. Sure and hooked it up perfectly for an absolute classic which has been referenced by many within the culture - and even ! Polyrhythm Addicts : Smash Banging, bludgeoning Hip-Hop right here, with DJ Spinna's beat indeed out to smash everything in sight. This is taken from the second Polyrhythm Addicts LP, \"\", which saw step away from the group and the also-ill take her spot. I think I missed this the first time round, only really hearing the , but after happening upon this it sounds like the lesser-known second album is worth seeking out. Slum Village & Mick Boogie ft. Rapper Big Pooh and Vice : Fresh This isn't the sound that many associate with Slum Village, but they've produced some pretty varied material sonically through the . The intentionally raw \"\" mixtape by Mick Boogie featured this grimy track, with banging drums, wailing electric guitar and dirty synth bass, plus the Detroit crew bringing in reinforcement from North Carolina in the shape of Little Brother's Rapper Big Pooh. Dungeon Family : Curtains (DF 2nd Generation) Going into the Organized Noize/Rico Wade catalogue again, this was a track at the end of Dungeon Family's \"\" album, and as the subtitle indicates, showcases the members of the crew who were up next after OutKast, Goodie Mob, and the rest. The one who probably jumps out to most is Killer Mike, who has gone on to have a long career as a soloist and as half of , but everyone holds theirs down on this track. For those that might not have known, The Dungeon was the name of in Rico's mother's house, where he and the rest of the crew honed their crafts and did their first recordings; it's nice that the name lives on. Nas & DJ Premier : Define My Name If you're a very online Hip-Hop fan, you'll certainly have heard this track already, but I thought I'd share it for those who aren't! This is the from the long, long-awaited Nas and Preemo album - and as much as some people complain they wanted it years ago, things happen when they happen. Nas breaks down his actual name and then looks back over his history from the viewpoint of someone who, like the rest of us, might not have imagined that nineteen-year-old who wrote \"\" still releasing heat at fifty! DJ Premier's beat is sparse in one of his signature styles, and of course his near-trademark scratch phrase hook is in effect. The wait is almost over... [Mark B] & Blade : Sealed With A Diss (Instrumental) RIP Mark B, who along with Blade made a great duo that even managed to get some mainstream success after years of holding it down on the underground. , the second A-side cut on the 2001 , was the answer to all those who took shots at them because of that success, with this urgent beat and Blade playing no games on the mic! Ultramagnetic MCs : Kool Keith Model Android 406 Sound quality is a bit rough, combined with some...interesting ideas on panning, but hopefully that doesn't take away too much from this Ultramagnetic rarity! It's on a compilation called \"\", but I can't seem to find what, if anything, it was ever on the B-side of - information would be appreciated. By the way, if you're looking to buy the compilation you might want to get the CD, as the overall pressing quality of the vinyl isn't great. Malcolm X : No Sell Out I was sure I'd played this recently, but couldn't find any record of it so I must have just been listening in the house 😆 was the producer here (though the record is credited to Malcolm X), and he had the idea of combining spoken word samples (this back in 1983!) with a beat, after hearing Grandmaster Flash playing part of the famed Dirty Harry \"\" speech over a record. , he built the track completely with drum machines, the cutting-edge tech of the time, and then laid quotes from the legendary over the top. It was controversial in some circles, but if nothing else, he ensured that he got permission from Malcolm's widow, , and that the family got paid. Love it or hate it, this was a groundbreaking for sure, and one that preceded the Afrocentric Hip-Hop era where Malcolm's words very much came to the fore. Big Daddy Kane : Mister Cee's Master Plan We hardly have DJs in rap groups anymore, so the DJ track has long since sadly been consigned to the history books in all but a handful of cases. However, there was a time it was a must and Big Daddy Kane cedes the spotlight on this cut from his debut \"\" to , the recently-departed , bigging him up on the mic and then letting him cut it up on the turntables. Plan executed. Gang Starr : Take A Rest (Take 5 Remix) Of course there had to be some Guru this month, so here we have a remix of an from the \"\" LP. London's gets on the boards for this one, keeping the foundation of DJ Premier's production but blending a little extra jazz into it! I picked this up on a , but the official place to find it is on the B-side of the itself. Sadat X : The Great Dot X (Instrumental) The wax I got this on () unfortunately doesn't credit the producer, but this takes an old R&B (in the original sense) dancefloor classic that was a big single in its day...and wisely, doesn't mess with it too much! Duke : Return Of The Dread-I We close the episode with a track from the late MC Duke, a UK pioneer who got his start when he who said he could beat anyone in the place! He was signed to the famed Music of Life label, on which he released two LPs - \"\" being the second. Of course, it heavily \"Star Wars\" in the way you'd expect from the title, with Double H Productions working the vocal samples into the hook of this frenetic track, with Duke himself coming with the rebel attitude like Luke Skywalker and the aggression of his father. RIP Duke. Please remember to support the artists you like!

Of course we pay tribute to Biggie, Phife, and Nate Dogg, with some music that may have passed you by previously. ...I make a point of not repeating tracks on the podcast, but her classic single \"Deeper\" is in the mix on if you fancy going back nearly twelve years into the archives. Her run may have been short, but the talent was there. Oh yes - the Hieroglyphics gig in Manchester this June ! Mastodon : Twitch : Event/stream schedule : Playlist/Notes The Notorious B.I.G and 2Pac : Where Brooklyn At? (Freestyle) Starting off raw, but also very much a selection that makes you sad when you consider what was lost - first a friendship, then two lives. Biggie and 2Pac at Madison Square Garden for this memorable freestyle performance (with some of the lyrics later turning up on other tracks), and DJ Mister Cee had the presence of mind to record it to cassette. The sound quality might be rough, but it's history. RIP to Biggie and 2Pac. [Oh No] Grand Agent : After This track is a shockingly short fifty-two seconds long, so I had to loop it up here to give a long enough instrumental bed for the voiceover - and it's a shame because it's easily one of the best beat on the \"Under The Circumstances\" project that Oh No produced for Grand Agent back in 2005. This was another bit of wax that I rediscovered during The Great Digitisation, and I'm glad I did - for everyone who missed it the first time round, there's a very affordable ! The Eastsidaz ft. Butch Cassidy, Nate Dogg, and Kokane : Cool We start the first mix over on the West Coast, Long Beach to be precise, with The Eastsidaz, a group made up of Snoop, Big Tray Deee, and Goldie Loc, and essentially a reprise of a previous group The Eastsiders that had Snoop, Crooked I, and Li'l C-Style as members. While the original group only released officially, the later lineup is much better-known, and their second LP \"\" is a well-regarded album for those who appreciate the style. The late great Nate Dogg blesses them with some vocals on the hook here, alongside the multi-talented but oft-overlooked Butch Cassidy who is actually the lead singer here, and another connoisseur's choice in Pomona's Kokane. The producer isn't one that you might immediately expect, but in fact Hi-Tek working with MCs who are spitting material far from the sphere! Tyler Daley : Never Look Down The first of a run of three Manchester tracks, this is a brand new single from half of Children of Zeus, taken from his aptly-named \"\" EP. Thematically this could have been part of Zeus' \"\" album, with Tyler both rhyming and singing about the challenges and pressures of balancing family life and a music career, over the kind of modern soul production that is a crew trademark. Definitely get yourself a copy of this new release. Berry Blacc, Dubbul O, & Jointhedots : The Rain Possibly the most appropriately-named record that could come from Manchester, Jointhedots are back with their of the year, with longtime collaborators Dubbul O and Berry Blacc on the mic. The jazzy, chilled vibe of the instrumental is a trademark of the crew, and both MCs settle into it perfectly - not trying to dominate it, not running wild, just fitting in as two more instruments, lyrical ones of course. Grab this single and keep an eye out for future releases...🤞🏿 KinKai & Mecca:83 : Safe Don't Say Short, but one where they leave us wanting more! A third straight local selection, this was on the mammoth \"\" compilation that raised money after the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. With over 200 tracks, it was easy for any individual track to slip under the radar, and somehow this gem did for me! Mecca:83 supplies a piano-led track with a little acoustic guitar in the back, and KinKai displays a preview of the quality he delivered on his three years later. [DJ Quik] Suga Free : On My Way (Inst) Playing instrumentals allows me to feature some songs which might be lyrically a bit...much - and plenty of Suga Free's material fits into that category! The vocal version is on his debut LP \"\", which is entirely produced by the man behind the boards here, Compton's own DJ Quik. Math Hoffa : Comeback Absolute fire - this was being trailed at the start of Math's \"\" podcast videos on Youtube before the full video surfaced. Still, , I wasn't counting it as a release until the audio was out to stream or buy, ! Wordplay and punchlines are the name of the game here, as the renowned battle rapper and podcast host starts off talking about his iced-out watch and takes it from there. GQ Beatz does a stellar job on production, taking a well-known Janet Jackson sample as the basis and filling out beautifully around it. I'm a huge fan of this single. Paul Wall & Termanology ft. CL Smooth : It's Magic The sound of this track is so chunky I wondered for a sec if Statik Selektah had sampled the Alex Isley of Patrice Rushen's \"\", but it's the original, expertly augmented. Taken from last year's \"\" album, this may have been an autumn release but it's got summer anthem (for the heads) written all over it. CL Smooth is the perfect guest star, Paul Wall is spitting heavy too, and Termanology brings it home with his rapid-fire flow. Expect to hear this on my Twitch streams and mixes this year! Large Professor : The LP (For My People) Classic boom-bap - which was, with a different sentiment, the feeling of Geffen Records, with \"\" when it was completed in 1996 as they felt it was too retro. Well, it's still getting play nowadays while many of the records they expected the Queens legend to ape have long since been forgotten. Bass is thick, drums are too, and it's just that straight-up 90s Hip-Hop. Phife ft. Dwele : God Send While I could have played something from Tribe, I decided that the Phife tune this month would be something from his final solo LP, \"\", which was released posthumously. Despite everything he was going through at the time, some of which he speaks of on the track, Phife is philosophical and even a touch optimistic, which says a lot about his spirit. Dwele provides some great added vocals, and the whole thing is undergirded by production from G Koop & Bobby Ozuna. RIP Mutty Ranks. Ge-Ology : Q-Boro Bonus Break 1 (Inst) Bonus is right - a cheeky extra beat on the 12\" of Apani B-Fly Emcee's \"\" courtesy of Ge-Ology - a producer maybe not known to everyone, but peep ! Defcee and BoatHouse ft. greenSLLIME : Close The Curtain This has been getting an awful lot of headphone time for me this month, and I can already see it making my Spotify Wrapped come the end of the year. You need to pick up the version of the \"For All Debts Public And Private\" album to get this - worth supporting as there a good number of extra tracks on top of what was already a very solid album. BoatHouse's dark beat is perfect for a weights workout, and both MCs go back and forth in classic duo fasion with skill, but the absolute highlight for me here is Defcee taking Jadakiss' and adding clever asides for an ! It's a really nice bit of borrowing that I like to think would make the man from The LOX smile if he hears it 🙂 Curren$y & Statik Selektah ft. Termanology : Gran Turismo Statik and Termanology together again (as 1982), but this time supporting the New Orleans legend Curren$y on the title track from a very enjoyable, if short . Laidback and kind of gentle, despite the solidity of the bassline and the crisp drums, it's less of a racing soundtrack and more of a sunset crusing accompaniment. X-Ecutioners ft. Anikke and Taboo : The Turntablist Anthem You might have missed this one, which was a smooth track from the 1997 \"\" LP. The album wasn't what I was expecting from this , being much more expansive - with scratch tracks and routines rubbing shoulders with spoken word, straight instrumentals, and tracks like this one! With the hook inspired by \"\" by The World's Famous Supreme Team, this has an unusual structure - on top of the beat you have mostly scratching courtesy of Rob Swift, the hook coming in periodically, and then a single rhymed verse to close out. The album might not have been a big seller, but is definitely worth your time for a listen. Terrace Martin ft. Arin Ray & Smino : This Morning I wasn't aware of Arin Ray or Smino (MC on the second verse) until I heard this, likely as a lot of R&B and the like passes me by, but together with Terrace Martin they're a fire combination! This was on the 2021 \"\" album and it's a sonic treat - those rolling drums, deep sub-bass lurking, and plenty of keys courtesy of Mr Martin put the pressure on the vocalists to come correct, and thy do. The Alchemist : Break The Bank A steady, melancholy beat that almost sounds like time counting down. Who'd have thought that half of would eventually master this kind of vibe? This instrumental is on the \"\" compilation, but you can thanks to Schoolboy Q, on the ten year-old (already?) LP \"\". Ice Cube ft. Deadly Threat, J Dee, Kam, King Tee, and The Maad Circle : Color Blind Wow. I was maybe fifteen when I first heard this towards the end of Ice Cube's \"\" album, and this collection of testimonies to the realities of Los Angeles' gang violence hits me even harder all these years later. The production draws you in without demanding the spotlight, which is rightly on the MCs. Every single verse has at least one starkly memorable line, even the closing two half-length verses by King Tee and J-Dee. I wanted to play this one in full, with nothing following it, so that you can take it all in in its entirety and hear every single bar clearly. A masterpiece, in my humble opinion.

The average ruggedness level is high, and we start off with a classic sample being used on a remix you might not know...volume up! Mastodon : Twitch : Playlist/Notes Slum Village : We Be Dem (Atomic Dog Mix) \"\" is one of the most heavily-used samples in Hip-Hop, and with good reason - even in novice hands it sounds good, and with someone like J Dilla in charge, it sounds amazing! He has it twitching on the three on a beat it's impossible not to move to, and on the mics, the crew don't get too complex. It's only a short one, which I got on a of unreleased Slum Village cuts, but I think you can find it these days on some of the digital platforms. In my opinion, this mix wins over the original version! The ARE : OH You can hear the sound of a well-known Michael Jackson cut being atomised and reconfigured on this killer from the , which punches so hard that you realise why the track title is in upper case! The whole project, as you might guess from the name, is all MJ and Jackson 5 samples, worked to perfection by the man from Houston who you may also know as a member of K-Otix. De La Soul ft. Yummy Bingham : Much More A single that deserved to be so as a standout from \"\", this starts off with an uncredited guest appearance by the questioning the commitment of some to the the Hip-Hop culture, before passing to the late great Dave (aka Trugoy) to handle the opening verse. \"Using these minutes like I value the call\" is a great analogy for an MC who understood more than many how important it is to say something when you have the platform to do so. J Dilla's beat is grand and imposing, and his re-pitching of the main sample as used in the hook wrong-foots you - it was originally sung by a man, but sounds like a woman by the time he's finished with it! Sol Uprising ft. Emanon : Feel The Sound Somehow I'd \"played past\" this one over and over again, due to it sharing a slab of vinyl with the incredible \"\" on the 2004 , but having stumbled on it while shortlisting for this month, I think I need to find more places to play it! Sol Uprising is the union of Sci the MC and the awesome , who is towards the top of my list of \"Musicians I Wish Had Released More Material\". Alongside them here are Emanon, with Exile (who you might know better for his work with Blu) on production, and Aloe Blacc on the mic. It's the records like this, the ones that slip under the radar, the ones that you sometimes take a chance on, that really make a DJ's record collection. L.E.G.A.C.Y : More Legacy strides over this cut from the \"\" album with so much confidence that you can't help but love it! 's beat from the heyday of the Justus League initially draws you in with the short sample that repeats throughout and his swinging drum track (with a different snare/clap than you might have expected), but that sneaky low bass really anchors it. Kid Capri ft. Big Pun and NORE : Block Party is regarded as one of the greats in spite of him unfortunately passing away without a huge amount of recordings - his impact was that powerful. It's always a joy to realise you have a feature by him that might not be known to many, and so we land on this collab alongside fellow Latino New Yorker Noreaga, with the legendary Kid Capri on production. \"\", on which this appears, was Kid Capri's 1998 album where he handled things behind the boards and brought in an all-star cast on the mics - being a DJ with his kind of pedigree, there were a lot of people he could call! Otis McDonald : One For Dilla This could happily be played anytime, but as we're paying tribute to J Dilla this month then it's a perfect inclusion for the current episode. You can definitely hear the influence throughout, even as it builds from an initial relatively chilled loop to a more energetic second section before settling down again. This is great work from the \"\" album. NEMS, Uncle Murda, Dave East, Scram Jones : NY Is Killing Me \"City workers give up twenty years of they life and still can't afford to pay a mortgage in the Five Boroughs...\" It's raw, it's abrasive, and it has a point! You might have missed this one from last year, but this Scram Jones-produced has Coney Islands' NEMS and guests expressing their frustrations with life in modern day New York City. It's like a rawer, more serious version of J-Zone's \"Bullshit City\", which the longtime listeners will have heard back on ! DJ Muggs & Meyhem Lauren : Ready For War There are many things I love about this track, one of the more specific being the sampled vehement assertions regarding the cost of the sound system :) Of course, the production from Muggs is dark and heavy as per usual and the man on the mic is one of my favourite MCs, Meyhem Lauren! The was another star-studded affair that spawned a companion shot in the actual Death Valley - and that in turn spawned from which this track is drawn. Buccaneer : Bad Man Story A dancehall classic that's been getting a lot of play from me recently, a gunman anthem on the Baddis riddim that can move any dance! This 1998 release is on \"\" LP, which is well worth a listen, as well as being a big single and also popping up in the Jamaican crime film \"\". Blak Twang : Online Bringing it to the UK for the last tune in the segment, and one I hadn't played at all for a long time - long enough that only after recording did I catch a line that I felt more comfortable censoring. From the third Blak Twang LP \"\" (following the originally-unreleased \"\" and \"\", Tony Rotton gets busy on a Preemo-influenced Harry Love track. Nicolay : The Specialist (Instrumental) The Dutch master himself has blessed us via the medium of modern digital distribution with a collection of his old unreleased instrumentals, \"\", which absolutely still stand up today. You can hear his more contemporary material as a soloist and as part of The Foreign Exchange, but this is a great bit of nostalgia and part of a wider set of releases celebrating twenty years of Nicolay's music. Method Man ft. Raekwon : Meth vs. Chef Easily one of my favourite cuts from \"\", Meth's debut and the first of the Wu solo albums, which somehow turns thirty this year... All the elements are here - raw beat, the infamous kung-fu samples (this time from \"\" and \"\"), and bars upon bars. Meth opens up before the bell rings to end his verse/round, and then Raekwon brings it home rough like Timberland wear, ! Semi Six : Silver Moon No singing hook, no hook at all in fact on - just a constant lyrical onslaught by one of the finest MCs in the D. The intro is eerie, off-balance, and makes it sound off when you mix it, but as soon as it's over, the dark beat thunders in and doesn't let up until the death - props to the producer, fellow Detroit native AntBell!, for providing a suitable soundtrack for this one. Mixmaster Mike : Bermuda Tri-Axl The 2000 \"\" release is so simultaneously chaotic and seamless that when I came to digitise it, the only way I could work out where each track began and ended was to look it up on Discogs and read from the track timings! The legend from / and also the Beastie Boys, whether on production or on the wheels, always walks that line between virtuosity and total anarchy in a way few can pull off. O.C. ft. Big L and The Lost Boyz : Dangerous The Sequel I cut this one a little short as O.C's next verse isn't so much to my taste! I thought sharing this slightly different version of the Big L-featured cut from the classic \"\" LP would be a good way to play a track you may not know while also including some Big L - like Big Pun, he sadly didn't have a long enough time with us to build a deep catalogue. Production is done by , who take one of the all-time classic samples and put some deep bump underneath it. This on the B-side of the excellent . [DJ Spinna] Jigmastas : Magnetize (Instrumental) The drums are smacking, the bass is rumbling, and the overall vibe is hectic on this instrumental from the 2016 \"\" album from this much-respected Brooklyn crew. I played the vocal version of this back on , which is definitely worth a listen! Natural Elements : This Is Not A Drill High-wire apocalyptic Hip-Hop, courtesy of one of the finest groups of MCs you can even think about finding anywhere. Over Charlemagne's dramatic beat, A-Butta, Mr. Voodoo and Swigga all tear it down on a that suits the extremely serious times we find ourselves in.

While it's been a bit bumpy over here, the selection on the first episode of the year is strong from start to finish. If you know every single one of these tracks already...we should probably have a chat as you clearly have an ear for the good stuff! Mastodon : Twitch : Playlist/Notes Organized Noize ft. Big Boi, Big Rube, Sleepy Brown, and Cee-Lo : We The Ones A very fortunate find during a recent digging expedition, I didn't even know that the \"\" existed until I had it in my hands. Looking around on Discogs, it seems that it was a limited release in 2017 of . Apparently twenty years in the making - probably because the production team behind OutKast, Goodie Mob, and more were kind of busy - it's a quality seven-song collection that you can now also get digitally! I heard a few seconds of this track at the listening post and it was the one that convinced me to buy the record, a musically-stirring and always-relevant and timely call to stand up and fight against oppression. Orbital : Adnan's This industrial-sounding track from the 1996 \"\" album was an extended version of they contributed to the 1995 \"War Child\" charity LP, and was named after a young boy who was killed by a missile during the war in the former Yugoslavia. Paul Hartnoll of Orbital broke this, and the rest of the album, down in a way only one of the creators could - so I'll link you to . Sepalot ft. Blu : Surrender I've heard the instrumental of this many a time and had actually forgotten that there even was a vocal version! The beat went down well on the most recent #BeatsOnly show on , so I thought I'd bring it out on this episode. The angular production from German producer Sepalot lurches, twitches, and squelches, with Blu fittingly being a bit more aggro lyrically than you might have expected from some of his better-known work. I have this on the B-side of a headed up by \"\" with Frank Nitty, but you can also find it on the 2014 \"\" LP. Jigmastas ft. Shabaam Saadique : Too Ill Does what it says on the tin! DJ Spinna on production on this track with the dramatic backing, courtesy of a well-known old TV show sample, while the processing on the vocals makes it sound like weak MCs are being admonished over the phone! By the way, the spelling of Shabaam's name is different than what I've seen on previous releases, but as it's written this way on this album (\"\") I'm taking that as being correct unless/until I find out otherwise. Public Enemy : Louder Than A Bomb A classic from what is , \"\" (lot of text to write on a cassette label btw). Those who follow me know I'll sometimes refer to the more grimy records as \"not calling for the building of a new nation or anything\" but this track literally does! Chuck D will always be the first name that comes to mind when pro-Black, politically-driven Hip-Hop is mentioned, and this is just one of his outstanding vocal performances. Bomb Squad on production of course, with a hard-hitting track that would dominate most other MCs, even now. Sonically, you might notice that the sound is busy but not \"thick\" - if it was made nowadays, I suspect it'd be mixed with a lot more bass, not to mention built with more high-fidelity samplers. Would that have been \"better\"? Hard to say, but this is revolutionary in all senses regardless. Bumpy Knuckles & DJ Premier : B.A.P. (Bumpy and Premier) For those of more gentle dispositions, you may as well skip to the next track! Otherwise, this is quintessential boom-bap rawness, courtesy of DJ Premier - one of the finest exponents of the style - and fellow Gang Starr Foundation MC Bumpy Knuckles. Wicked track from the \"\" LP, where Bumpy starts each verse with the same four bars, before raining fire on snakes, suckers, and studio gangstas over the rugged beat. No sir, Bumpy did not fall off, not even a little. Stro Elliot : Miles Funk I may have been late getting on the Stro Elliot train, only hearing his stuff in the last three years or so, but now I'm firmly on board and settled with a book and some snacks. The drums are cracking and merciless on this track from his , and they lead the way for the bassline and funky guitar to do what they do. Definitely check the album - it's really excellent work. Dubbul O & Jointhedots : Life:Mics to open the year! You should already know that Dubbul O is one of my favourite MCs from any coast or territory, while the excellent Jointhedots have been holding it down in fine style since most of the members were part of the best-known lineup of The Mouse Outfit. The most special feature on this track is the guitar of the much-missed , who sadly passed away in 2022, and whose family will continue to benefit from any posthumous releases. Coming together over the peak of the COVID restrictions, this track started when bassist/bandleader/producer Defty sent beats around Manchester for musicians to add their own touches to. As well as Phil Ratcliffe, the flautist Dr Claire Press got busy on here - you may remember her memorable work alongside Dubbul O again on \"\" all the way back in ! Flavourful and polished music as always from this collective, and worthy of your support. New Sector Movements ft. Allysha Joy : These Times Neither of these artists were on my radar previously, so it was a big bonus when First Word Records included this cut on the \"\" compilation! As it turns out, New Sector Movements is actually an alias of IG Culture, a UK stalwart respected for his work as part of Dodge City Productions, and of course he shows the deft touch of a veteran on the music here. The vocals are carried by the powerful voice of Australian songstress , who started singing as a youngster in the church and you can hear the influence very much still with her! This track in full is actually about six minutes long, so if you like what you're hearing, you know what to do... Common : The Movement I'll have you know that I did actually mix this in bang-on, but J Dilla decided to go all the way weird with the timing and drum placement at the start, to the point I almost re-ripped the tune from the \"\" CD to be sure! This one had somehow escaped me on first listen, but it's got that electronic sound that was increasingly a feature of Dilla's late work, with that edginess contrasting with Common's smooth and familiar voice. Actual Proof ft. TP : Show You The Way North Carolina in the house, with Actual Proof (Enigma and Sundown) linking with guest TP (who I don't know much about) for a 9th Wonder-produced track that sounds very different than the intro might lead you to expect. Lyrically, in places it almost comes off as a rougher, less civilised take on \"\" by dead prez, blended with some of that - in attitude, if not in flow! Track down the 2012 \"\" LP for this one. Mecca:83, Buscrates, and J Vibes : Amber Hue Such warm vibes emanate from this , with Macclesfield, Pittsburgh, and Aarhus (Denmark) in collaboration. I don't know who did what, but the final result is a thing of beauty! Tall Black Guy, Craig Mack : Flavor In Ya Ear Remix The by is one of the greatest in Hip-Hop history in my opinion, so it takes a brave man to put his production in its place - and , Tall Black Guy is that man! Tough drums and a relatively simple bassline provide the structure for some spaced-out touches and soul vocal sampling to undergird TBG's take on . 1773 & Strange Soul Music : Dialed In Manchester's Strange Soul Music is a fearsome producer, the man no-one wanted to face in last year's beat battle! He's been putting in that work for years and this is from one of his latest releases, \"\" a seven-track collaboration with Chicago MCs Jay Nagoma and Wisdm Uno. Themed around a that might be unfamiliar to the younger listeners, this is a brief, but strong, opener to the project. Clear Soul Forces : Nine 5ive It's a shame that the 2020 \"\" LP is ostensibly the last from this Detroit crew - their stuff has always been energetically high-quality. Ilajide on the beat of course, while on the mic, CSF reference everything/one from to via in a track that lasts well under three minutes. May the force be with them, indeed. Heather B : Steady Rockin' Straight-ahead Hip-Hop, with the commanding voice and bars of Heather B over the boom-bap production of DJ Premier. Vocalist Twyla adds a little sugar to the hook, but the rest of this track from 2002's \"\" is pretty much as stripped-down as you can get. Khrysis : The Devil Wears Designer (Instrumental) North Carolina representing again here, with a groove borrowing clearly from a classic soul record on this from \"\". DJ 2-Tone Jones ft. Prince Po, Asheru, Joe.D and yU : Not Down I've always thought that one of the most important inflection points in the culture was when our ability to self-police was countered by the epithet \"playa hater\", which nowadays is more likely to take the form of \"but he getting the bag tho\". This call to arms from the \"\" LP features real MCs with real commitment letting us know that the leeches, the culture vultures, exploitative corporate interests of various shapes, and everyone else taking away from the culture rather than adding on need to be ejected. The production is not minimal as such, but well-spaced, with the sparse drum pattern and Indian string samples avoiding a situation where the instrumental ends up fighting the MCs for the spotlight, which is critical when what they're saying is of actual importance.

Still, it's fixed now, so I didn't freeze to death putting this episode together! As we draw towards the end of the year, the themes here might be wintery and seasonal, but the tunes are heat :) As promised, here's the link for - definitely support this collective (and the that hosts the monthly events!) if you want to support grassroots talent 💯 Twitch : Mastodon : Show/Stream Schedule : Playlist/Notes Median : Median Alleviates The Drama A deep cut from the heyday of the Justus League, with 9th Wonder (of course) chopping it up on this breezy beat for his Winston-Salem, North Carolina, compatriot to get busy on. You may not know Median as he only recorded two albums, his last in 2011, but he's a grounded yet imaginative writer who is well worth your listening time. Of interest to many who do take the time to dig into his history will be \"\" from the 2007 \"\" LP, his sequel to 2Pac's famous \"\". Soul Supreme : Mood Swings Big shout to of Eastern Bloc who gifted me the \"\" LP on wax for my birthday earlier this year! Amsterdam's Soul Supreme has been giving us quality music for a long while now, but in recent times has been locked in what sounds like an awful legal dispute with a record company and another producer. Despite still being in the thick of it, he delivers his commentary in the form of instrumental music on this album, which is even clearer when you read the track titles. The interplay between the horns and his keyboard work are the highlight on this particular track, but for the full effect, sit down and listen to the whole album end-to-end. Cookin Soul : Kamaal Xmas Time usually comes out with a special Xmas release each year, mixing up an artist you know well with seasonal sample flips. This track comes from the 2002 \"\" collection, and takes Q-Tip's verse from \"\" and adds on a few more lines I can't place before going full Christmas - but keeping that boom-bap! Noveliss & Mega Ran : Memory Card One of the OGs of leaning fully into video game culture in Hip-Hop alongside the Clear Soul Forces veteran and manga writer Noveliss? You know the references are going to be fire. Hir-O provides the beat, and both MCs bring it as they centre the concept of the (ask your parents if you don't know) on this standout from their \"\" album. Bounty Killer, A.R.P, Curly, and Tulokk : Evils Of Your Mind (Edited) Devil on one shoulder, devil on the other? Almost like a dancehall version of Eminem's \"\" (especially with that second voice), this is a big single from 2001 on the \"Heavyweight\" riddim that also appears on the 2002 \"\" album as \"Evils Of The Mind\". 2002 was a busy time for the , who also dropped \"\" that same year. Kuartz & Vybz Kartel : Clarks (Kuartz Real Badman Remix) If you're a DJ, especially in a city like Manchester where crowds react to big sounds, get \"\" just for this monster! A local producer with worldwide rep and reach, Kuartz has done the home scene proud and on his latest release, the industrial, digital vibes come through loud and clear. The cold, wintery feel on the intro make it a perfect inclusion this dark month. Kuartz bends and effects the voice of Vybz Kartel as much as any other instrument on the track, making for a sound system killer! Da Beatminerz & KRS-ONE : Seckle KRS was one of the first to really bring that reggae/dancehall flavour into the Hip-Hop arena, and Da Beatminerz have had that as an element of their style since they debuted on the production for the , so this is a union you know is going to come correct. Slow and low , with the soundclash samples at the front, back, and in the hook, this loping, skipping beat allows Kris to come through clear as a bell on the mic, still, after almost forty years of recording. Continue to enjoy new artists, but support the veterans too! NYG'z ft. Rave : Itz On Rugged and triumphant in equal measure, this was the big opening track on the first and so far only LP from NYG'z, \"\" from 2007. Guest emcee Rave (sometimes credited elsewhere as R.A.V.E Roulette) features on six of the album's fifteen tracks, which definitely puts him in \"honourary group member\" territory! Production is handled by , who also released this album on his own label Year Round Records - truly backing this crew in every way possible. PS - the apostrophe setup in the artist name and song title are verbatim from the release, don't come after me :) Paul Wall & Termanology : Talk About It As I say, you might not think that Houston's Paul Wall and Lawrence (Massachussetts) native Termanology are the most obvious MC pairing in the world, but my goodness, they fit togther perfectly. They already gave us one excellent LP in \"\" and now they're back with \"\". It might just be in my head, but it feels like they each lean towards each other - Paul Wall with slightly more wordplay in his flow, and Termanology dialling back on the trademark syllable barrages he can unleash at any time. bases his production around a great soul sample I added to my own collection this year, spices up the hook with some cuts. Curren$y ft. Mac Miller : Money Shot I've always been iffy about including this one from 2014's \"More Saturday Night Car Tunes\" - partly because the sound quality isn't great, but also because if I'm honest, I don't think the verse on this is his finest work. That said, I know many people online disagree with me and love it! Curren$y is solid here, but for me, the real star is the production by Sap - taking a great late 70s slow jam sample, and speeding it up (which speaks to how slow the original is), layering a suitably straightforward drum track, and then trying to turn your speakers inside out in the closing seconds! I blend out during that segment, just in case...don't want any of you coming after me for damages 😄 Luxury Elite : Parkway A bit of vaporwave for this interlude, pure 80s vibes on this slow, moody instrumental from the \"\" album. Luxury Elite digs out some of those really obscure 80s samples for her work, and it's all about just vibing out to the loops and little change-ups. Mega Ran, Young RJ, Erick Roberson, Abstract Orchestra, Daru Jones, Marcel P. Black : Black Is Beautiful Apologies to Marcel P. Black - the digital file I read the artist information on at first didn't have his name, but he kills it on the third verse and rightly deserves major respect here. This is a gorgeous and poetic track about Blackness from the 2020 \"\" album by Young RJ and Mega Ran, which is not just (or even mostly) about police violence, but a varied and well-rounded LP. Young RJ produces this one in not just the sense of getting on a beat machine, but pulling in Leeds crew Abstract Orchestra, frequent collaborators with the Detroit scene, plus the Grammy-winning drummer Daru Jones and shaping the union into this exceptional song. Amp Fiddler : Eye To Eye I first heard this track on a mix, and it was years before I could tell you who the artist was! It turned out to be just one facet of the talents of the brilliant , who featured this track on his debut album \"\". It's a classic piece of funky soul, which could easily have been written twenty-plus years earlier, but had all the quality and polish to stand out in the early 21st century. . InI : Mind Over Matter Classic, if relatively little-known heat from the 90s. This Mount Vernon crew had their debut \"\", from which this is taken, shelved due to friction with the label and legal issues around ownership, but it was heavily bootlegged before eventually surfacing officially in 2003. Solid rhymes here from Grap Luva, Rob-O, and Ras G, atop some vintage action courtesy of Pete Rock, who produced the whole project. Platinum Pied Pipers ft. Invincible : Detroit Winter After that brief trip to New York State, we close out the section by bringing it right back to Detroit, this time to the PPP duo (Waajeed and Saadiq) for a track from their debut album, 2005's \"\". MC Invincible of the Anomalies crew kills it on the mic with their almost monotone flow, describing the bitter coldness of Detroit in detail, making it a suitable selection for this time of year. Musically, the piano riff is the standout element, but if you listen really closely, you can also hear a famous rhythm sample in the background quietly holding it down too! [EZ Elpee] Capone-N-Noreaga : Calm Down (Instrumental) \"Calm Down\" never made it onto the classic C-N-N debut album \"\" due to sample clearance problems - hey, I guess wasn't down with the Queensbridge thug life - but you might get lucky and find it on a promo 12\" somewhere. If you're really lucky though, you might find an instrumental LP of tracks from the LP, including a couple that, like this one, didn't end up on the final release. Nice beat by , just a shame it didn't get the shine it deserved! Souls Of Mischief : A Name I Call Myself I really didn't know what to end this episode with, but settled on a track from a which turned thirty this year. This was a deep album cut, produced by Del The Funkee Homosapien, with some really clever sample combinations underneath the cheerfully-rhymed X-rated lyrics! It's great to see how Souls' music has continued to reflect their journeys through life, from this during their teenage years through to the present day - and by the way, they were in using the internet to promote their music.

Seeing your favourite artists live is the best way to put money in their pockets, and buy the vinyl/CDs/downloads of the stuff you like the most! /episode/index/show/airadam/id/29208418\n\ninfo_outline Episode 174 : Twin Flames\n\nEpisode 174 : Twin Flames \"Ain't a damn thing changed boy, protect ya neck!\" - RZA This month marks a full thirty years since the landmark date of November 9th 1993, when two of the greatest albums of all time - in any genre - were released. I've played many of the tracks from those LPs on the podcast over the years, but both do get a nod of respect in the selection here, alongside some absolute fire new releases and old classics. This month's selection tends towards veterans of the culture, while for the most part staying in the relatively recent past. Like Nas says, keep on putting out records...we want to see and hear the art! Twitch : Mastodon : Show/Stream Schedule : Playlist/Notes Champion Sound ft. Smif-N-Wessun : One Luv This is a really grand-sounding track which deserves to be heard from the very first note. The piano chords and overall instrumentation bring to mind less a Hip-Hop single and more the kind of thing you might hear on the soundtrack of a Spike Lee film. I looked up the band Champion Sound and was amazed to find that they hail from Prague - a serious cross-continental collaboration for them to link up with Brooklyn's finest! Tek and Steele drop grown man street raps over the brooding, cinematic soundscape for a standout from the \"\" LP that just dropped last month. [DJ Eclipse] O.C. : Time's Up (Remix Instrumental) Buckwild's beat for the of this classic single is one of the best-known and loved pieces of production in Hip-Hop history, and it would take a brave man to remix the track - enter DJ Eclipse. The former Fat Beats retail supremo and DJ for Non Phixion isn't one to shy away from a challenge, and he does an excellent job bringing a different flavour right here. While this might have once been tough to find (I'm only just hearing it for the first time myself), it's now easily available on the , which has been released digitally. Wu-Tang Clan : 7th Chamber In the month where we celebrate the of the release of the debut Wu album \"\", I've gone for one of the deeper cuts that isn't something you'd hear at a typical gig or club night. Quintessential Wu, with RZA nailing the production (personally, I love the before the main groove comes in), and seven of the Clan MCs murdering the track. Wu forever, indeed. Kev Brown & J Scienide : Legendary Rugged Simply a slice of raw Hip-Hop, no fancy studio gloss, just rough drums, deep bass, and a warbling main sample over which J Scienide spits that goodness. Kev Brown drops some bars himself on the second verse, showing why he clearly has to be thought of as one of the best producers on the mic of the current era. 2021s \"\" LP is inspired by the great duos both inside and outside of Hip-Hop, and Kev and J pay tribute in fine style. MC Eiht ft. Xzibit : Medicate The various battles over the years aside, I love to see how much true respect the veterans of the culture have for each other, especially when it leads to pairings you might not immediately think of! In this case, Texas-born but longtime Brooklyn resident DJ Premier, possibly the exemplar of the East Coast sound links up with one of the OGs of the scene in Compton, California, the legendary to executive produce his \"\" album, from which this is drawn. Connecting with Xzibit takes the union to an even higher level, and Austrian producer Brenk Sinatra captures just the right vibe for both MCs to get busy on. Krumb Snatcha : Rich Man Poor Man A heavy album track from \"\" that I'd imagine passed most people by, Da Beatminerz come with some boom-bap accented by a dramatic horn sample for one of Boston's ruggest to spit over. As a man whose trials and tribulations are a matter of record (including his \"\"), when he gives you lyrics like this they come with the weight of someone who has experienced the realities of the world first-hand. [Hit-Boy] Nas : 40-16 Building (instrumental) I just picked up the of Nas' \"\" LP on vinyl, and this was one of my favourite beats on that album. As great as Nas is on it, I always love a chance to hear the production brought to the forefront! Pusha T : Just So You Remember \"Livin' a lie, but die for your images.\" This dark and subdued Kanye-produced track from \"\" absolutely drips with menace and contempt from the pen and vocal performance of Pusha T. You might recognise the sample, which was on \"\" by DJ Shadow, and it bubbles along with the periodic vocal interjections from the original source, in between Pusha's verses - notably, the first being longer than the other two put together. Packed with quotables, this is headphone music at its best. Queen Omega & Little Lion Sound : No Love You might have heard the raw, 100% from-the-soul vocals of Trinidad's Queen Omega on an that was going round recently, where she recorded an absolutely fire dubplate over the beat for Dr. Dre's \"\". This is the original track it's based on, a roots reggae cut with a lyrical message that seems especially accurate right now. Shortie No Mass : Here Goes Nothing I only heard this recently and assumed I was just way behind the curve, only to realise it's a 2021 release! This MC famously guested on \"\" on \"Organix\" before releasing a couple of singles and then falling all the way back for an extended period. After many requests from fans over the years, , from which this is the appropriately-named title cut, and is more after getting very positive feedback! I don't have credits for the digital release, so I can't say who produced this, but it's got the vibe of the opening track passed through a happier filter, and of course you know the lyrics are tight. Six Figga Digga & Camp Lo : The Jig Six Figga Digga might be known to you as Lord Digga (when he was with the INC Crew), or just Digga (certainly around the time of his work for Biggie), and he's been in the industry for years, not always in the forefront but always keeping the quality high when you do hear him. He lines up two of my favourite MCs, Camp Lo, the slang grandmasters of the Bronx very nicely here. You usually put textures together in a beat that sound like they could have come from the same place, but to blend electronic drums like these with those seventies sounds and make it work takes real skills. Catch this one on the recently-released \"\" LP. Agallah : Gotta Love Me (instrumental) I've always got time for an Agallah instrumental, and this soulful groove from 2015s \"\" is, despite an undeniable bump, actually a chilled beat you could add to your studying playlists :) Temu : Temu's Talkbox Groove I can't remember how I happened across this track this month, but I'm very glad I did! It seems that Temu is a modern day funk maestro, a devotee of all that that makes you pull the stank face, and a true \"\", as his debut LP is titled. Flying the flag for that vintage heavy electronic funk, this track references quite a few tunes you might know as he takes you on a journey, rocking the talkbox through the whole track like the great Roger Troutman would have done. If this man comes to Manchester on tour...that's a guaranteed ticket purchase from me! Essa & Pitch 92 : Heavyweight A from two quality artists in combination - Pitch 92 on production (alongside co-producer Viva Cee), and the young veteran Essa (formerly Yungun) on the mic. Thumping, rolling beat with Essa's assured vocals running over the top make for a heck of a preview for the forthcoming album from this duo. Erick Sermon : Stay Real Taking it back to the early 90s, this was the second (and final) single from Erick Sermon's solo debut, the wryly-titled \"\". Everyone knew the pressure was on after the , but he came out strong as a solo artist with this LP and shut down all the questions. His trademark lisp accents his bars over a tough self-produced beat highlighted by that synth-funk bassline, plus a little Roger Troutman in the hook. Clear Soul Forces : Get Wit It No shame if you missed this one the first time round, as it was a bonus track only on the , ten years old this year. It's what you expect from this Detroit crew - bouncy production from (with some nice short bass stabs and an epic clap) and styles upon styles from the whole crew on the mic. It's certainly not intended to pander to the club, but if you have a pulse it probably wants to make you move nonetheless! J Dilla : Say My Name (Instrumental) Weirdly, when I played the vocal version of this track all the way back on , it was also following an Ilajide production! Anyway, since then I've got hold of that were used for the controversial \"\" project and even if this beat was an offcut, it's better than a lot of people's best work! Natural Elements : #TribeVibes I almost played this last episode, until I realised the milestone we were reaching this month! One of the ever to form, Natural Elements and their producer Charlemagne pay homage to the great A Tribe Called Quest on this track. Beginning with and interspersed by an announcer inspired by the performance of the Laurel Dann on \"Midnight Marauders\", the crew kill it over beats inspired by \"\", \"\", and \"\". \"\" is my favourite Tribe LP to this day, and this is an appropriately high-quality homage to it.

Unfortunately during that time, we lost a couple of respected DJs and producers, and , both of whom are included in this month's mix. May they rest well. The selections for this month span a time period of almost fifty years, from a 1975 funk classic to a brand new release from one of Manchester's finest, making stops in the 80s and the independent Hip-Hop wax era of the 90s - something for all the heads! Don't forget - you can always get an up-to-date list of my next few upcoming streams and gigs @ ! Twitter : Twitch : Mastodon (because Twitter is basically on fire) : Playlist/Notes DJ Muggs, Roc Marciano, Meyhem Lauren, and Rome Streetz : 67 Keys I've seen live recently with another (Rome Streetz) I would have seen if it wasn't for work's on-call schedule, talking pure drug business over some thriller film-type production courtesy of , who has constructed an amazing second act post the Cypress Hill classics that everyone knows him for. Everyone gets busy on the mic on this , with Meyhem killing that last verse. David Cutter Music : Upstart UK beat action here with this London beatmaker cooking up a quintessential boom-bap type of beat with a little of that DJ Premier flavour and heaviness - I might need to blend this with some M.O.P! Get this on the recently-released \"\" LP. MF DOOM : Lickupon I went back to the \"\" LP after being gifted an amazing alternate cover for display recently, and this was a standout on my first listen in a while. The producers (Heat Sensor) work the same sample as Biggie's \"\" but with all sorts of other stuff going on, and DOOM just goes nuts from beginning to end. Bars upon bars with no hook, purely the sounds of someone who loved to flip words every which way. Doo Wop ft. Raekwon : Castle To Castle You've got to be brave to hop on a track with the crime-rhyming slang master Raekwon if MCing isn't your full-time gig, but Doo Wop (one of Biggie's favourite DJs) gives a good account of himself here as well as holding down the production! A classic jazz sample is the basis for this track from \"\" which is also available on a if you need the clean version and instrumental. Little Brother ft. Rhymefest and Supastition : Do It To Death A personal headphone favourite I could have sworn I'd already played on the podcast, but which somehow missed the selection for the last fourteen-plus years! All four MCs kill it, but my favourite is absolutely Phonte on the opening verse, with his \"\" reference never failing to make me smile! Focus... is on production and those drums are absolutely smacking here, making this track a highlight of \"\". Marley Marl : Hip-Hop History #4 Short and sweet, with a chunky and bouncing beat from the godfather of sampling as we know it today, and no rhymes - just a few words about his own history in Hip-Hop. Find this one on the 2000 \"\" release, which I thought might be a big hard to find but is actually available digitally. Kev Brown & Dre King : Black Champions Tough, tough instrumental that I've had on repeat this month, taken from the seven-track \"\" project from these two musical masters. Dre King is, amongst other things, a sample pack producer who provides for producers to sample, and his work is used to great effect once Kev Brown gets it into his MPC. No hi-hits on this, just the kick and snare smashing through the whole beat, giving you little spaces where just the bass and keys play before the drums kick you in the head again! Pharoahe Monch ft. Jean Grae and Royce Da 5' 9\" : Assassins An appropriately named track from the \"\" album, with all three MCs fitting perfectly into the roles of Hip-Hop assassins (check the full version to get the intro), since none of them have ever encountered a beat they couldn't kill. M-Phazes is on the beat, and it's appropriately loud and dramatic - not something that blends into a mix naturally, because so many things don't sound quite like this. [DJ Premier] Westside Gunn, Conway The Machine, and Benny The Butcher : Headlines (Instrumental) I was surprised to find I hadn't played the vocal version of before, but DJ Premier's provides a nice bridge here between a track with no outro and one with too little drum intro - coming in hard with the aggressive stabs before transitioning into string-led production. Redman : Bricks Standup A short freestyle-ish expedition from Redman's \"\", which sees one of the all-time greats killing it over the instrumental for Jay-Z's \"\". That instrumental was produced by Brooklyn duo The Buchanans, who somehow cooked this up as one of their first creations and got it placed on \"\" - talk about coming in hot! Peanut Butter Wolf ft. Rasco and DJ Q-Bert : Run The Line Taking it back to some late 90s underground Hip-Hop that brings back memories of the tail end of my time at university in Manchester, and especially the time when turntablism was starting to break out of the preserve of only the absolutely most in-the-know to the wider Hip-Hop world and beyond. Q-Bert obliterates it on the scratch as he does literally every single time, with all kinds of flaring action that might as well have come from outer space to many of us! Stones Throw founder Peanut Butter Wolf is on production of course on this track from his debut solo LP release \"\", and the all-California lineup is completed by Rasco on the mic. Cleveland-born, but as one of the Cali Agents...he counts. Tyler Daley : These Cards One half of Children of Zeus and a certified triple threat, Tyler shows off his singing, rhyming (in case you forgot), and production skills on this bumping . And he's 100% correct...he's done alright, to say the least. The 45 King : Meganizm While The 45 King is best known for his 80s productions, he was also the producer of tracks like Jay-Z's \"\" and \"\" for Eminem as well as a number of far more underground collections of beats, like 2006's \"\" from which this track is drawn. A chilled head-nodder with a straightforward and clean drum track on top of some summery keys and bass, this fits just as well at a BBQ as on a mixtape! SoulChef, Steph Pockets, and DJ Groove Damoast : When It Comes To This RIP , who passed away this month. I didn't know the full extent of his work, only knowing his name as a DJ on Twitch, but he was a well-regarded DJ and producer out of Philadelphia who is deeply missed by many. Having heard this on one of the many tribute shows, I decided I wanted to share it here. New Zealand's SoulChef is on production, Groove Damoast is the man on the turntables cutting it up with precision, and his Philadelphia compatriot Steph Pockets controls the mic from start to end. Quality Hip-Hop. Dynamic Syncopation ft. Mass Influence : 2 Tha Left Early 2000s pick here that I encountered on the Ninja Tune \"\" compilation, but was also on the 2002 \"In The Red\" LP by the combo of producers Loop Professor and Jonny Cuba. As much as this breezy, acoustic guitar-laced track could have been a great instrumental, they stepped it up by drafting in Mass Influence, an underground crew of MCs out of Atlanta who sound very different to what would come to most people's mind when they think of Atlanta Hip-Hop! Apparently some people know this from an advert for Adult Swim segment of Cartoon Network, so it's interesting to know that stuff like Ninja Tune had that kind of reach within the generation who are not making the decisions :) Fred & The New JB's : (It's Not The Express) It's the J.B.'s Monaurail, Pt. 1 (Not my apostrophe placement, by the way!) I had a bit of a play with the cue points feature on Serato to extend this live-drummed intro a little bit, just because those hi-hats are so fire. A classic funk workout from Fred Wesley and the rest of James Brown's famous band of that era (from the \"\" LP), and one that has been sampled on at least three tracks I can think of - I don't know if the sample was cleared on my favourite usage, so I won't mention it here even though you might have heard me play it in the past... EPMD : Let The Funk Flow I'll be real - this is far from of the tracks on EPMD's classic debut \"\", but I couldn't pass up the chance to blend into it off the back of the original sample! Listening to the cuts on this makes me smile, performed by the group's original DJ K La Boss (who is still working today under the name Dj4our5ive) in his early years. [Rashad Smith and Sean \"Puffy\" Combs] The Notorious B.I.G. : One More Chance (Hip-Hop Instrumental) In a then-contemporary example of the new school calling back to their Hip-Hop inspirations, Rashad Smith and Puffy essentially lifted the monster Marley Marl beat for Craig G's \"\" for this drastic remix of a track that was already a remix...ok, stay with me on this. The original \"\" was on \"Ready To Die\" and was pretty raw on the X-rated rhymes, and was then essentially with Faith Evans on the hook with a bit of a bow tie on the production, sampling DeBarge's \"\" for radio appeal. However, the winner for many of us was that Marley used seven years before! Latee : This Cut's Got Flavor Closing with a production, a real classic for heads of a certain age that you don't hear often enough nowadays! This has an absolutely monster drum track highlighted by those heavy kicks, and the slowed-down guitar riff is a perfect era-appropriate backing. Latee only had a few releases under his own banner, along with a decent number of guest appearances, but these to me will always be the rhymes that come to mind whenever this Flavor Unit MC is mentioned. This track just makes me want to put on a and drive an somewhere. To my desk job, I suppose 😁 Please remember to support the artists you like!
