He is known for his deep, grimy voice and having a sophisticated and rugged flow. After releasing two albums with Heltah Skeltah, Nocturnal and Magnum Force, Rock left Duck Down Records and pursued a solo career. He signed to DJ Lethal's Lethal Records and recorded a solo album titled Planet Rock, which was never released after the label folded. He didn't make an appearance on the Clik's 2002 group album The Chosen Few, being the only member of the \"Great 8\" not to appear. He made his official return to Duck Down in 2005, making appearances on Sean Price's Monkey Barz album and Smif-N-Wessun's Smif 'N' Wessun: Reloaded album. He's performed songs for a variety of video games including \"I Am Rock\" for Need for Speed: Most Wanted, \"This Is Me\" for Blitz The League II and \"I Am Rock\" for NFL Street 2.
