It reveals the corrupt music industry! The creative packaging on the 12\" jacket will receive more than a second glance in record stores. On the front cover are cut-out paper dolls.

The topic is a pretty heavy-handed one, especially for a genre whose best anthems have had to do with money, ho's, and clothes, but party rocking beats and an all-star cast of Bay Area underground stars keep the record from sounding like one long psychotherapy session.\n\nThe Real Deal puts producers and rappers on even footing, introducing pairings like cartoon-voiced MC Bas-1 with prolific Oakland beatsmith Fanatik, a raw-sounding Stimulus backed by classic funk styles from Paul Nice, and a shrill Charizma, who is almost overshadowed by his backing track, a crackling crate digger's soundscape by Peanut Butter Wolf. The sixteen trackswhich also includes some funky turntablist cut & paste numbersare broken up by interludes where artists, a sales rep, and David Paul himself grouse about various topics like payola and price gouging. The compilation is a great place to hear Bay Area indie artists in their natural habitat, but you can't help but remark the the best song on the disc, Foreign Legion's \"Happy Drunk,\" is more about rolling out than getting sold out. - VH (Flyer magazine / Sept. 2002 issue)\n\nclick here for more info and the Track Listing\n\nCD Liner Notes - want learn the truth about the music industry?\n\nclick here to read \"The Real Deal\" article by Jeriko One\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nCHILLONOMETRY - Mad Doctor X\n\nReleased September 2002\n\nCompact Disc\n\nCatalog # : BHH2051\n\nCLICK HERE to purchase via iTunes\n\nCLICK HERE to purchase the CD\n\nMusic lovers tired of rappers will appreciate the slammin hip-hop beats, heavy bass lines and funky rhythms on this mostly instrumental 18 track CD (only 6 tracks contain vocals). \"I'm doing music now that is truly close to my heart.
