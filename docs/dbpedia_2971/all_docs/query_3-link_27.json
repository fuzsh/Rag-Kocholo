        "text": "As the world is getting ready to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Hip Hop, some of the genre’s biggest icons are stepping back into the limelight including the New York supergroup Boot Camp Clik. After a sixteen year long hiatus, the group now returns with an old school music video alongside their new single “Wotcha Call Strength.”\n\nBoot Camp Clik is a Brooklyn, New York hip-hop supergroup started by Duck Down Records in the 90’s and comprised of the eight members; Buckshot (Black Moon), Tek and Steele (Smif N Wessun), Rock, the late great Sean Price (Heltah Skeltah), Starang Wondah, Top Dogg, and Louieville (O.G.C.). The collective has also recently added long-time affiliate Rustee Juxx to the group.\n\nThe Clik was one of the genre’s first true supergroups that changed how hip hop music was received as their influence in music and fashion was undeniable during the genre’s golden age. Individually, and collectively, the BCC has created numerous classics, albums, and singles including Black Moon’s Enta Da Stage, Smif N Wessun’s Dah Shinin’, Heltah Skeltah’s Nocturnal, Fab 5’s (Heltah Skeltah & O.G.C.) ‘Leflaur Leflah Eshkoshka” and Sean Price’s Monkey Barz.\n\nNow, back for round two, the BCC’s new single “Wotcha Call Strength,” produced by The Arcitype and directed by David Janoff, reminds the world what true icons they really are. The video shows the group roaming around an empty Forest Hills Stadium in Queens. Starting off strong with a verse by Rustee Juxx, the song follows each member taking their turn speaking their truth straight to the camera, showing viewers what a comeback truly looks like.\n\nBCC’s co-founder Dru Ha claims, “In honor and celebration of Hip Hop 50, we felt that the BCC’s catalog of work, contributions and legacy needed to be recognized properly. It’s too easy to sit back and say the Hip Hop community should verify you and painstaking to go out and have to remind people with words, so we felt there was no better way to make a statement than to drop a new record with all the original members (RIP to Sean Price).”"
