        "text": "Pre-first album sessions\n\nSaafir started exactly like 2Pac as a featured artist for Chopmaster J's Force One Network, Money B's Raw Fusion and as a Shock G's Digital Underground official member.\n\nMainly produced by Jeremy JZ Jackson, the one who produced \"Something Wicked\" and \"Troublesome\" for 2Pac.\n\nDiscogs page\n\nListen or grab it there\n\n1. Light Sleeper (Original Version)\n\n2. Joint Custody (J Groove's Spliff Mix)\n\n3. In The Future\n\n4. The Heavyweight\n\n5. Prime Time After Seven\n\n6. Running From 5.0\n\n7. Bones\n\n8. Killen Kydz\n\n9. No Return - The Set Up\n\n10. No Return (Original Version)\n\n11. Ball Point\n\n12. Whomp 2000\n\nBonus Tracks :\n\n. Quest For Survival feat. Plan Bee & Pooh-Man\n\n. Rock The Show (I Wanna Know) - \"Battle Drill\" B-Side\n\n. Pull Ya Card - \"Just Riden\" B-Side\n\nProducer – Jeremy JZ Jackson (tracks: A1, A4, B3, B4), Big Nous (tracks: A3), J Groove (tracks: A2, B1, B2, B6)\n\nRemastered By – Justin Perkins\n\nThese tracks were recorded before Saafir's first album Boxcar Sessions. Some of them had been released earlier in the Promo CD Unreleased Boxcar Sessions in 2002.\n\nTrack 6 was released in Hobo Juction's member Plan Bee's Quest For Survival in 1994.\n\nSaafir started like 2Pac, as a member of Digital Underground\n\nSaafir doesn't have had the occasion to record many songs with 2Pac. They are just featured together in Raw Fusion's \"Pass The 40\" (cf. Tales of a 90's N.I.G.G.A.), a posse song only released in 92 in Hollywood Records Sampler promo. From West Oakland, Saafir appeared in 1991 in the background vocals in Money B & DJ Fuze Raw Fusion's \"Do My thang\" (cf. Live in Styleetron), probably recorded at the same time than \"Pass The 40\". The same year, he is featured in two tracks of Chopmaster J & Dave Hollister Force One Network first album The MME Program 1. The next year, he is an official member of Digital Underground for their third album, The Body-Hat Syndrom (credited for 9 tracks). He will also be featured in their 96's Future Rhythm album.\n\nIn 1994, Saafir appears in the very famous \"Wake Up Show Anthem '94\" with Nas, Pharoahe Monche, Ras Kass, Lauryn Hill... in Street Fighter OST with Ras Kass and Ahmad. The same year, his collective the Hobo Junction (with notably Big Nous and Jeremy JZ Jackson from The Underground Railroad) recorded one of the most the most infamous clash versus Del's Hieroglyphics group (cf. Battle), prolonged with his clash with Hiero's main member Casual (cf. unofficial Saafir tape). He is even featured in Casual's first album Fear Itself in 1994.\n\nThe same year, he published some 12'' : \"Battle Drill\" prod. by J Groove, \"Light Sleeper\" prod. by JZ, \"Just Riden\" prod. JZ. His first solo album Boxcar Sessions got released the same year with notably a speaking interlude by Pee Wee of Underground Railroad. In 1995, he released the EP Limited Edition with the Hobo Junction.\n\nIn 1997, he released the album Trigonometry under the alias of Mr No No, with 6 songs produced by JZ and two featuring with and produced by Shock G. In 1999, in his album Hit List, 3 tracks were produced by Shock G, one by Tony Pizarro and it features Kam, Jayo Felony and Chino XL.\n\nSnoop Doggy Dogg's second album recording sessions : second half of 1995 / March-November 1996\n\nMaterial for a triple album ? probably mixed with a new LBC/Pre-Eastsiders project (after original album being shelved because of Snoop/Lil C-Style dispute about royalties)\n\nThe album was ready to be released in September but the death of 2Pac seems to have deeply modify the project.\n\nTha Doggfather Original Demo LP (pre-Vegas tracklist)\n\nCorleone's Revenge : The OG Mafioso album (leftover tracks)\n\nThe Eastside Party (various released tracks outside Snoop's album)\n\nUnused Instrumentals\n\nSPECIAL THANKS to Bomb1st Forum & Jay2Chill\n\nback cover of Tha Doggfather\n\nsaid to be the original cover planned for the album\n\n### Tracklist by Jay2Chill. We chose to not follow the \"Demo LP\" leaked by Bomb1st Forum in 2016, just a random compilation of demo versions of retail songs. It is much more interesting to use the tracklist purposed by Jay2Chill of Bomb1st Forum (in a thread of June 2023), trying to rebuild the album sequence of September '96, right before 2Pac's death, following newspapers, interviews and other collected info. Except that we included demo versions instead of any retail songs. ###\n\nThe Sessions Part 1 : The Original Demo LP (Pre-Vegas) - LISTEN\n\n1. Freestyle Conversation (Rough Mix) (4:26)\n\n2.

We can hear a snippet of it in Smokefest Video, at 5:28. A re-recorded version of the song has been released in No Limit, Top Dogg.\n\nTracks 1,3,5,11,14,17 are close to the released version but with many different elements.\n\nTracks 4,7,9,10,12,13,15,16 were not included in Tha Doggfather LP (Death Row, 1996).\n\nTracks 3,7,10,13 have been released in a close form in SmokeFest World Tour (1998, Dogghouse) / Fuck Death Row (1999, No Limit).\n\nTracks 8 and 9 have been released in Gridlock'd Soundtrack (1997, Death Row)\n\nTrack 8 was included in a previous sequence of the album and would have been replaced by \"Snoop's Upside Ya Head\".\n\nDoggfather single\n\nThe original Doggfather LP : if 2Pac wouldn't have been killed in Vegas...\n\nIn 2016, Bomb1st Forum leaked a Bootleg with a compilation of alternate mixes and unmixed songs from Tha Doggfather, and a compilation of leftover tracks. All these unreleased materials are taken from early sequences of recording of the album, mainly from circa summer of 96.\n\nJay2Chill, in a Bomb1st forum's thread of June 2023, shared his work of reconstruction of what could be the state of the Doggfather album, right before 2Pac's death in early September. This has been deduced from the known tracklists of the DATs and the various info collected here and there in interviews, articles... After Pac's death, Snoop notably took off songs with 2Pac, remixed some other and shelved some which will end up in the SmokeFest World Tour album. More than half of the album was totally changed. We miss only four demo songs (if there are any existing alternate mixes) and a totally unleaked one (we can only hear a bit of it in Smokefest Video - maybe somebody could put the retail vocals of the song over the original beat remade) to get that sequence. It has no interludes, what is often said as a weakest point in the released album.\n\nWith this rebuild tracklist, we can listen to a different Doggfather album. Would it have changed the destiny of Snoop Dogg and Death Row Records ?\n\nFirst steps of the album : Don Corleone & Don Makaveli\n\nWhen 2Pac joined Death Row label in the fall of '95, Snoop Dogg was still struggling with his justice case (what ended in February of 96). It is said that at that time he had troubles to write new lyrics... 2Pac would even have told him that his original verses in \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" were weak, what led him to re-write and re-record his parts (some people even said that this lost original could have become \"Wanted Dead or Alive\"...). That could explain why 2Pac and Daz wrote reference songs like \"This Ain't Livin\" and \"Street Life\" in February-March of 96 when he started recording sessions for Doggfather.\n\nSo the Doggfather sessions really started in the end of February of '96, right after the end of the case, in the night of the 20th to the 21st. 2Pac was then recording his second solo album for Death Row (cf. Me Against The World pt. 2). After or before Pac recorded \"Changed Man\" with Nate Dogg (lyrics that refer to Carlito's Way could be also applied by Snoop's situation), Snoop recorded with 2Pac the freestyle song \"If There Was A Cure\", and maybe \"Word on The Street\" with his L.B.C. friends Bad Azz and Techniec. But it could be also this day he recorded the first \"Eastside Party\" with Nate Dogg, Daz and the remaining member of L.B.C. Tray Deee (Lil' C-Style was already left in Dec. - Jan., cf. Haven't You Heard ?). Five days later, he recorded \"Just Watching\" with 2Pac, the Dogg Pound and Hurt-M-Badd, and 2Pac recorded the reference song \"This Ain't Livin'\" for him...\n\nBut this is mostly the following month (March of '96) he recorded a first amount of songs for his album : \"Gangsta Walk\", \"May I\", \"Doggfather\", \"I Will Survive\", \"Change Is Gonna Come\", \"Wake Up\", \"Come On Home\", \"Tommy Boy\", \"Never Leave Me Alone\", \"2001\"... And Daz recorded the reference song \"Street Life\" for him. In April '96, Snoop recorded new songs : \"Gangsta Life\", \"Smoke Enough Bud\", \"Dogg Collar\", \"Doggyland\", \"Too Black\", \"Poly High\"... what leads him to reconsider the direction of the album.\n\nFront cover of the Bomb1stForum's Doggfather bootleg presented as :\n\n\"20th Anniversary Sessions Edition\"\n\n## Tracklist by Bomb1st Forum. For this second part, we give the tracklist of the Bomb1st Anniversary unofficial bootleg and not the rebuild tracklist of a known sequence of the album because it would have had a lot of tracks in common with the Original Demo LP. This gathers most of the other leftover tracks still unreleased (in their original form) that were recorded during Doggfather sessions. ###\n\nThe Sessions Part 2 : The OG Mafioso Album (Corleone's Revenge) - LISTEN\n\n1.

All the tracks included are leftover songs from Doggfather sessions and were then unreleased in their original forms (\"Vapors Battlecat Remix\" has been released one year later in Neva Left, and was initially planned to be included in Doggumentary EP).\n\nIf we put apart the four last songs (used in the Original LP), the album so organized starts by the whole story of the birth of a mafioso, and it ended in \"Street Life\" by these words : \"Corleone, rest in peace\". So the subtitle of the known bootleg of Doggfather II, \"Corleone's Revenge\" could be more than a random title. The Doggfather sessions has enough material to constitute that legendary Doggfather II.\n\ncover of a bootleg (picture taken from the booklet of the album)\n\nwith a selection of featurings, soundtracks...\n\nWas the \"real\" Doggfather 2 a Pre-Doggfather ?\n\nThe commonly known Doggfather II bootlegs, single disc (here) or double disc (available here and there), were constituted of songs taken from SmokeFest album and from various featurings (2Pac, Nate Dogg...), compilations and soundtracks (like \"Freaky Tales\", \"Let Me Hit Something\") and some well known unreleased leaked songs (like \"Lil Crip A Lot\", \"Last Man Standing\") which are not from Doggfather sessions, but more from Snoop's late times at Death Row or just after he left...\n\nOn the contrary, the songs here have been all recorded during the Doggfather recordings (1996), before the final mix which took place after Tupac's death in September '96. They can constitute a full forgotten album, a Doggfather pt. 2 or more exactly a pre-Doggfather. But nothing indicates that Snoop once thought to release a double album or a follow-up to Doggfather album, especially because these leftover songs were about mafioso subjects, that he seems to want to give up... These songs were put aside with the progressive constitution of the album we know and would probably have been given or re-used for various projects even if Snoop would not have left Death Row.\n\nPromo picture\n\n### This tracklist is based on Lost Sessions Vol. 1 tracklist and completed with all non-album released tracks recorded during the Doggfather sessions. ###\n\nThe Sessions Part 3 : Tha Eastside Party\n\n1.

Nate Dogg ==> Snoop's Greatest Hits\n\nL.B.C. Crew about to become the Eastsiders ?\n\nIn the beginning of '96, Snoop & Doggystyle's project L.B.C. Crew went shelved because of Lil' C-Style and Snoop arguing about royalties. So in parallel of his album, it seems Snoop was probably thinking to record a new LBC Crew project without Lil' C-Style who does not appear in any Doggfather sessions (except if we consider that \"Doggystyle 96\" and \"Out The Moon OG\" that appear in a July DAT could have been recorded later than 95 - what is not believable).\n\nThe group name \"LBC Crew\" itself was not used anymore (except by 2Pac in \"Untouchablez\". In late Feb. - March of 96, Snoop recorded \"Eastside Party Original\" with Daz, Tray Deee and Nate Dogg, \"Eastsiders Original\" with Daz & Tray Deee (produced by Soopafly), maybe a new version of \"21 Jumpstreet\" called \"21st Street\" with Tray Deee & Daz, \"Gangsta Walk\" with Dogg Pound, \"I Will Survive\" with Techniec & Kurupt, \"Tommy Boy\" with Daz, \"Smoke Enough Bud\" with Jewell, \"Dogg Collar\" with Bad Azz & Big Pimpin, and very probably \"Word On The Street\" with Bad Azz & Techniec...\n\nThe group name eventually changed to \"Eastsiders\", a first version of the group that Snoop will later form with Tray Deee and Goldie Loc. Was that name restricted to Snoop, Daz and Tray Deee or was it supposed to include other close partners for a party album like we chose to consider it. Some songs from one project moved to Doggfather and other came in.\n\nIt is funny to notice that \"Eastside Party\", probably recorded circa end of February of 96, starts in its final mix version (probably mid of 96) by 2Pac's voice (something like \"nigga ya yop...\"), the exact same mix than in the end of \"Initiated Remix\" (with the blow sound during the whole song) that has also been produced by Daz.\n\nThe Sessions, pt. 4 : Unused Instrumentals -\n\n1.

But if 2Pac disses Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony in interviews and in the outro of \"Late Night (Til My Dying Day Moe-Z Remix)\", unleaked song from Dramacydal shelved album in 95, he early invited Nutt-So in his projects (cf. Thug Pound).\n\nLISTEN to that album or grab it there.\n\n1. Car Chase (Intro)\n\n2. Nut Case\n\n3. We Don't Love 'Em feat. Duce Life & PLESOR\n\n4. The Weekend\n\n5.

Next 2 Kin, A.M.W., Jet, NTO, Confusion & Duce Life\n\nProduced by GO Twice (2, 3, 4, 6, 9), Chucksta (7, 8) & Bust a Bitch (3, 9)\n\nRappers from the Bay Area : Nutt-So, Mo $avage and Len B. aka Pound.\n\nStreet Thugs appear with a bunch of Demo Tapes in the 90's (here and there, probably in 95 or maybe 94). But they were particularly noticed with \"Deep in the Game\" in the compilation Bay Area Playaz, alongside rappers like Knumskull of Luniz produced by DJ Fuze (of Digital Underground), Sh'Killa (who had record \"Don't Make Enemies With Me\" with 2Pac in late 94), The Link Crew (with Ant Dog, Ray Luv...), and also JT The Bigga Figga and The Delinquents. They also appear in Lil Big's group America's Most Wanted second album The Real Mobb (whose one member, Chucksta, is also the producer of two songs in this EP, and two in his solo album ; A.M.W. is featured here and Lil Big will be featured in \"Don't Sleep OG\" with Nutt-So).\n\nGo Twice is the main producer of the group and will be known for having produced original \"Ghetto Star\" feat. Nutt-So (released in Better Dayz album), and a remix of \"Don't Sleep\" featuring Outlawz and Nutt-So. The funny thing is that he also produced songs for The Govenor's album Floss Mode in 1995 (in which Gov' sings Pac's \"Po' Nigga Blues\").\n\nNutt-So is the older brother of Keyshia Cole (who also met Tupac at the age of 16 - maybe the day he got killed). He appears solo in 1996 in Blackjack's album Addicted 2 Drama for the song \"Fuck Your Life\", album which as well features regular Street Thugs friend Jet (here featured), Luniz, The Notorious B.I.G., MC Eiht, Spice 1... and 2Pac ! in the Promo sampler for the song \"Can't Turn Back\" recorded in the beginning of '94. It is said that he was firstly invited by MC Hammer - also from Oakland - to come to record with him (in late '95 ?), but he was invited to give verses with Dogg Pound, Gonzoe from Kausion and 2Pac in January of 96 for Thug Pound Project. So maybe he met Hammer through Death Row connection at that time where 2Pac was also recording reference song \"Too Tight\" for him. Nutt-So will record \"Too Late\" with Hammer and 2Pac (but also \"Can U Feel It pt. 1\" with Storm, Kurupt, Mac Mall & Spice 1 probably after Pac's death). With 2Pac he recorded many more songs after \"Too Late\" : \"Wordz 2 My First Born\", then \"Ghetto Star\" and later during Pac's last summer \"Don't Sleep\" and \"Runnin' on E\" with the Outlawz. He was not listed in One Nation first sessions (with east coast artists) but would have been in the final album for sure (\"Runnin on E\" was probably initially recorded for One Nation if we listen to the last dedication to Boot Camp Clik in the original version, cf. Ghetto Starz).\n\nDuring his time alongside Tupac, he was also recording for his first solo album, already announced in this group mini album, then titled as \"Thug Livin'\" but which will finally be released under the title \"The Betrayal\", but really later in 2000 and without \"Ghetto Star\" and \"Don't Sleep\"..."
