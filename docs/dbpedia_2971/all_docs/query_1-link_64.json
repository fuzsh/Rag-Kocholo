EMPTY ROADS…. hip hop.\n\nRead more\n\nScarub \"Savvy Traveler\"\n\nsavvy traveler might be the best song you never heard of. scarub’s flow over the od beat is wild. omid’s beat in itself is wild but scarub gets lost in the beat and comes out the other side dusting himself off. this is real hip hop.\n\nRead more\n\nBart Oatmeal x ICECOLDBISHOP \"Politickin'\"\n\nI was lucky enough Baron Davis play in person when he played at UCLA in the late 90’s. Baron Davis and Nate Robinson represented greatness to me as they commanded respect on the court. Being a PG is not an easy task but Baron and Nate were court generals. Now Baron Davis is kicking down some doors and entering the rap game as Bart Oatmeal. In this article, I explore some of the best cover artwork in rap history which I feel is the easiest way to capture an audience.\n\nRead more\n\nohkaywhy \"cave of wonders\"\n\nYall falling asleep over there? Change up the beats in your headphones and let’s get some audio coffee for your ear drums… Stop trying to predict what drums are supposed to sound like on a track and let’s get a little experimental with the drum machines… machine have emotions too ya know?\n\nRead more\n\nLARRY JUNE \"TANGIBLE ASSETS\"\n\nThere’s never been another rapper cooler than Larry June. He’s out here sipping smoothies while hitting some numbers in the morning… Maybe he’ll take one of his BMX bikes out today after playing tennis with some techies in Mission Bay… It’s all organic work with Larry so grab your freshly squeezed orange juice and a matcha and let’s go get it players… Larry June szn.\n\nRead more\n\nGHOSTFACE KILLAH & KANYE WEST \"NO FACE\"\n\nGhost dropped a hell of a song with Kanye recently. Did you hear it? Have you listened to Ghostface Killah in the last 20 years? If you haven’t, well… you have a lot of music to listen to this weekend. Tony Starks is one of the best to ever grace the mic in any genre. With that plush robe like he’s Ric Flair’s younger brother? Fireeeeeeeeeeeeee\n\nRead more\n\nNugLife \"FIND MY WAY\" (FEAT. VIVA MESCAL and TRIZZ)\n\nNugLife and DJ Quik have a lot of similarities to me. I know that’s a bold statement so just hear me out…\n\nRead more\n\nA$AP ROCKY \"1 TRAIN\"\n\nWe don’t need any more rap beef. We need rappers and producers to channel their creative energy to make beautiful music that captivates people. Hip hop is a form of therapy so bringing in this negative energy to the community is horrible. Bury the beef…. Start collaborating… Chase the lives you save with your rhymes instead of some bullshit likes.\n\nRead more\n\nSEAFOOD SAM \"COWBOY LEATHER\" (FEAT. PINK SIIFU)\n\nY’all still sleeping on Seafood Sam? The Long Beach, CA emcee just dropped his new project and it’s super dope. If you’re not hip to the west coast underground rapper, I got you covered. Peep the article and catch a little west coast wave this morning.\n\nRead more\n\nMAC MILLER \"HERE WE GO\"\n\nI did it all without a Drake feature! Mac Miller is top 5 all time. I’m ready to argue with anybody about that too. He was taken from us too early but luckily we have easter eggs all over YouTube to track down. Good shit too… Here’s an ode to one of my favorite tracks from Mac along with some of the biggest collabs he had over the years.\n\nRead more\n\nSCHOOLBOY Q \"COOTIES\"\n\nThe new ScHoolboy Q track “Cooties” is a special one. Q is elevating his rap game to match his golf game and parenting game. It’s been cool watching Groovy Q grow up right before his eyes. His new album drops on Friday and the content he’s been dropping has been craaaaaaazy! Peep “Cooties” and catch the vibe.\n\nRead more\n\nJERU THE DAMAJA \"YA PLAYIN' YASELF\"\n\nSomething about that 90’s grimey NYC hip hop era has never left me. Groups like Wu-Tang Clan, Boot Camp Clik, Gang Starr, and Mobb Deep ruled my walkman back then. And emcees like Nas and Jeru kept me pressing that rewind button over and over again. Out of that grimey era, it was one emcee that I listened to more than the others. It was Jeru the Damaja and his work with DJ Premier on the beats… Classic era that I wanted to go back to for y’all….\n\nRead more\n\nE-40 \"MR. FLAMBOYANT\"\n\nE-40 is one of the best rappers to ever bless the mic. He came up rapping in the late 80’s and developed his vocal inflections and off-the-beat sped up delivery on tracks like 1991’s, Mr. Flamboyant. E-40 is a legend out of the 90’s bay area rap scene and is still fresh on the mic today. If you happen to have $400 to spare, kick it over my way so I can finally pick up the cassette for “Mr. Flamboyant” on eBay. Here’s some more on a young Earl getting his start in the rap game.\n\nRead more\n\nJ DILLA \"TIME: THE DONUT OF THE HEART\"\n\nToday would have been J Dilla’s 50th birthday. It also marks the 18th anniversary of his album, Donuts. Jay Dee is a legend whose legacy lives on even after he passed back in 2006. This article is a dedication to one of my favorite songs of his and one of my favorite albums of all time. RIP Dilla.\n\nRead more\n\nSAUCE WALKA \"I'M HIM\"\n\nI just feel like 2024 is going to be Sauce Walka’s year. He’s been on quite the run here for a minute on tracks like “Dangerous Daringer”, “Sanchie’s P Maybach”, and now “I’m Him” which dropped recently. I don’t believe Sauce is signed to Griselda but his work with Westside Gunn and Conway the Machine have been nice. And his rapping over beats by Daringer? Sign me up for a full project with those two. I know I’m not the only one who would be feigning for that one.\n\nRead more\n\nSCARFACE \"ON MY BLOCK\"\n\nIt’s pretty cool seeing Scarface get some shine right now with the Tiny Desk performance. Most of us haven’t listened to some Face in a minute so it’s time to get out those old Geto Boys cassettes and Scarface CD’s and press play. Scarface is one of the goats… Just think though… What if he wasn’t from Houston and popped off in Compton when The Chronic dropped? What if he was on Death Row?\n\nRead more\n\nBENNY THE BUTCHER \"LEGEND\"\n\nAs we await Benny the Butcher’s new album dropping in early 2024, I wanted to revisit a few tracks where Benny and Griselda first caught my ear. Benny gotta be on your top rapper lists and if he’s not, you’re likely sleeping.\n\nRead more\n\nMURS X WIARDON - SPEAK N SPELL DELUXE\n\nToday marks the official release date of Murs x Wiardon dropping the Speak n Spell Delixe project wherever you stream music. The original Speak n Spell EP dropped earlier this year back in March and it was the first release from my record label, Mid90s. This new project adds on 3 brand new tracks and 2 fresh remixes to the OG project.\n\nRead more\n\nMURS \"FLOWERS FOR GURU\"\n\nThe new single from Murs x Wiardon is here and damn is it buttery. The beat Wiardon made on this is straight out of a smoky jazz club in the ‘60’s and Murs pulls up a stool with a cig in his mouth and drops some lyrics that melt right onto the beat. “Flowers for Guru” is here and it’s the first single off of the deluxe version of the Murs x Wiardon EP, Speak n Spell that dropped back in March of this year. Give this one a peep… It’s a special track.\n\nRead more"
