        "text": "August 25, 2015\n\nDa Beatminerz (Belize)\n\nDJ Evil Dee and Mr. Walt—collectively the founding members of Da Beatminerz—are the Belizean brothers behind the gritty sound of Boot Camp Clik, the Brooklyn super-crew consisting of Smif-N-Wessun, Heltah Skeltah, Buckshot and Original Gun Clappaz (O.G.C.).\n\nWalt and Evil Dee represent Bushwick, Brooklyn, where they first hashed out their hazy sound on Enta Da Stage, Black Moon’s debut album from 1992. While Baby Paul, Rich Blak, and Chocolate Ty were added to Da Beatminerz as the Boot Camp Clik expanded its roster, the Dewgarde brothers remained the core of the production crew, with Dee also holding down duties as Black Moon’s DJ."
