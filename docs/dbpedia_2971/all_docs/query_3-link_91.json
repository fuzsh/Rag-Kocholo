        "text": "When B.I.G and Pac died it seem all the beef they had with rappers have died with them. That’s not a bad thing by the way, it’s just that if Biggie was here the Hip Hop world would have been crazy. Most radio heads from back then have no idea how the streets were getting a bit tired of the watered down stuff Biggie was being linked to. You have to understand no one had any idea Life After Death was gonna be so gangsta. So the streets were hearing the watered down beats and not as rugged bars.\n\nEvery shot taken at Biggie wasn’t as up front as what Ghostface did on the purple tape or Jeru on “One Day” and the fact that Jeru used the same sample as “Players Anthem” for his song “Playin Ya Self” made his issue with Biggie more obvious. Many weren’t really touched on at all like what De La Soul were saying all over the States Is High album or the shot those in the BCC (Boot Camp Clik) were takin shots at Biggie. And it was only a rumor back then about Nas throwing jabs at Biggie. Truth is many rappers were going at Biggie not just the ones I named. Some out of jealously because he was making that transition from underground to mainstream with ease and still keeping a nice grip on what the streets loved about him. Some just didn’t think he deserved all the praise he was getting back then. Some thought he was tearing the culture apart and making Hip Hop look bad with Big Willie movement that as I’ve said was more in his videos because Ready To Die wasn’t about that at all. That became Big during the remix to “One More Chance” and the Junior M.A.F.I.A album. I like to think that group of people were somewhat fusing Biggie with Diddy and the more pop sound Diddy was going for before Biggie passed. I mean would the “Mo Money Mo Problems” video had looked like it did if Biggie was alive? Could you picture Biggie in a shiny suit?\n\nAs good as say the “One More Chance remix” was it still was aimed at the females. The singles off of the Junior M.A.F.I.A album were watered down. Those radio heads have no idea about the songs Biggie did with Tracy Lee or the now classic first time connection with Jay – Z. So when we saw Biggie on BET, MTV and heard him on the radio the songs were not bad but just soft. Mixtapes were huge then and BET and radio was still playing good Hip Hop so people were dismissing what Biggie was doing back then to a degree. I mean an unknown to the public Mase almost outshined Biggie on the 112 remix for “Only You”, and Mase verse wasn’t that dope at all plus the Biggie verse was the same verse from the original. Even on “Mo Money Mo Problems” Biggie verse wasn’t the highlight it should have been. Yeah it looked like Biggie was falling off to anyone on the hood level. Add that to the fact Jay – Z was getting love, Nas and The Firm was all over mixtapes ( Clue mxtapes most of the time), The Wu Tang Clan was still the shit hood wise, Smooth Da Hustler was making a nice run in the game then too. Biggie was barely making the mixtapes rounds back then and back then a mixtape was an underground thing and if a rapper doesn’t get his songs on there or even shows up to set the tape off with a freestyle then that rapper is no longer part of the “real Hip Hop” world.\n\nWhat Life After Death did give us was Biggie acknowledging those who threw shots his way. Nas claims “Kick In the Door” was about him and listening back I can hear that because Nas was grimy in the early 90’s and became successful out the blue with It Was Written. DJ Premier and Lil Cease confirmed that that same song was also used to address Jeru. Biggie had lines weaved in for the Wu Tang Clan too. Even as he addressed his beef with Pac it really was playful with exception of “Long Kiss Goodnight”. So imagine if Biggie was still here and he started going on Clue and or Kay Slay mixtapes during the late 90’s and early 2000’s? An added feud with anyone during the time Jay and Nas were beefing Ja Rule and 50, KRS and Nelly, Jermaine Dupri and Dre, Ludachris and T.I. Could the third album have had a “Takeover” “Ether” type track on it? That could truly put the beef out there and possibly ruined a career or the rapper he was aiming at would have done damage to his career. I remember how Life After Death made me a fan of Biggie again because I for one did think he was losing his grip on the hood. The Difference between me and many other people who do remember those years between 95’ through 97’ is I will admit Biggie was off and on for me. I am so glad that Biggie dropped a solid second/last album and it had more bangers than those radio attempts on it. It showed Biggie was still about Hip Hop. Still before that album dropped it wasn’t just MC’s beefing with Biggie, we as fans had an issue with him too. If you say you didn’t back then you might be fromBrooklyn or a radio head.\n\nRemember all the Hip Hop collaboration albums that you read or heard about back in the day? I mean all the would be albums that had titles and some type of demonstration to go off of? With the Best Of Both Worlds dropping because Jay – Z and R. Kelly songs were so on point on one another albums the thought was they would have a dope album together right? Well yeah that wasn’t a good idea. I personally like to think if the album would have popped off when it was first thought of the outcome may have been different. The thing is there are a nice amount of albums that were thought of but never brought to us for one reason or another. So right now I’d like to give 10 would be albums a nice quick review.\n\nThese reviews would be based on the time they were thought of and the sound of the time the album would have been released. I know some MCs suck now as opposed to when they were on the tip of every Hip Hop heads tongue.\n\nDr. Dre and Ice Cube\n\nRemember when OJ did his now famous getaway in the white Bronco? That was the opening scene in the video of a Dre and Cube song “Natural Born Killaz” that was the teaser to the album they were supposed to dropping around that time. It would have done well both men truly achieved their own identities within the music game at that time. The reunion album would have gone platinum out the gate. I remember the “Let Me Ride” video when cube walks out the ladies room, which was the talk about the video. Maybe D.O.C really did fuck them over by taking the album title Helter Skelter for his own poorly received album. In any event with so much old Dre material that has leaked on the net tracks from those sessions if there were any at all have never leaked out that I’m aware of.\n\n2. Dr Dre and Rakim\n\nYeah this was such a long awaited and maybe luckily scrapped idea of a mostly produced by Dre album Oh My God by Rakim. It had a nice ring to it when the news first broke because it was the best MC in the history of Hip Hop and the best producer in Hip Hop getting together. Of course both men had different mindsets and I’m not sure if 5 tracks may have even been recorded, Rakim said some tracks were recorded though. It’s cool no bridges were burned and both parties came away ok I guess?\n\n3. Foxy Brown and Lil Kim\n\nOh yeah I remember the talks of this would be album Thelma and Louise. If it had happened both women would have held their own because at the time they were the only real female MCs anyone cared about. I’m sure the Da Brat would have made an appearance on at least two tracks since all three women came off good on that Total remix of “No One Else” and JD and Puffy had something going on back then. Not sure who would have handled the production at all since Tone from Trackmasters is Foxy’s cousin and a member of the production team of The Firm and Puffy was trying all he could to be aligned with anything Junior Mafia back then. Given the sound of Ill Na Na this might have been a dud but the thought of this album would have given it an Illmatic type vibe too where the heavyweight producers would have gotten in on it, who knows what would have happened? It could have been a chance to hear Biggie and Nas on the same track and Nas Biggie and Jay on the same fucking album… that would have made it worth it back then.\n\n4. Jay-Z, Biggie and Charli Baltimore\n\nAh the never capitalized on side project of Biggie and Hova that included the then new girlfriend of Biggie Charli Baltimore who was from Philly ( the name always throws me off) The Commission. Biggie shouts the group out on his second album and we all know the three official tracks Jay and Biggie have recorded before his death. This album would have been like the Junior Mafia project just with more power behind it producer wise. I know Primo would have had tracks on there out the gate, we’re talking 97’, fuck yeah Primo would have about 3 tracks. It would have been even better if the first single was produced byClarkKent who really was running with both men and had a major role in them connecting in the first place. I figure The Lox would have shown up since by this time they were in the cut at Bad Boy. Then again Biggie really kept his side projects separate from Bad Boy which is why I’m not sure Puff would have shown up on this would be album. Of course the death of Big is the reason nothing ever happened, hell Jay never rocked with Charli at all that I know of.\n\n5. Wu Gambinos\n\nThis extension of the concept from Only Build From Cuban Links had so many people buzzing about what outside MCs would show up. Word had it The Firm members would have made the list for sure since Nas sealed the deal on “Verbal Intercourse”. The thing is by time this album would have dropped the whole rap mafia thing was dying down, it’s one reason why The Firm project was such a flop. The thought of what Rza would have came up with beat wise is enough to keep this in the cut of “what could have been?” for me.\n\n6. The Four Horsemen: Ras Kass. Canibus, Killah Priest and Kurupt\n\nThe predecessor to Slaughterhouse (Royce, Crooked, Joe Buddens and Joel Ortiz) never got pass a few freestyles together here and there. There are song where two members got together but as far as I know nothing where all four men connected on a song. All dope MCs and if they would have inked a deal the production should have been top notch shit. Daz would have came in and anyone from the Wu production staff even Rza himself maybe would have thrown a track their way. The album would have been all over the place though because all four men really swing for the fences with concepts. It may still happen who knows?\n\n7. RAGU Rea and Ghost United\n\nEver since “Can It All Be All So Simple” dropped as a single in 94’ the thought of an official Ghostface and Reakwon album have kept Hip Hop and Wu fans waiting for the big pay off. The teaser with them joining Method as a trio didn’t help it at all. This album even if done somewhat poorly would still be classic because the chemistry between these two is undeniable. One would hope Rza gets back to his old I’m broke and looking for anything to freak style of beat making for an album with these two… The good ol’ Wu Tang days… Miss that shit.\n\n8. 2Pac and Boot Camp Clik\n\nThis album is actually done but will never see the light of day so this does kinda sorta count. It also is a nice piece of untold history because more and more stories keep coming out about Pac rockin with East Coast dudes during his beef with Big that somehow became a Hip Hop coastal war. It would be nice to have whoever owns the masters or the tracks to give them to Buckshot or somebody so the public can hear that shit\n\n9. Any Freddie Foxxx collaborative album\n\nFreddie Foxx is a true underground dude and he like 50, Lil Wayne, Royce and a few others who have mastered the game of online promotion. The man was really getting back at people and uploading links to free music on Myspace and he keeps it real on Twitter. What Foxxx also has is unreleased albums like a motherfucker. He says he has a project with a few dope producers as well as an album with KRS. As of late I’ve been hearing mad shit he (Foxxx) and Statik Selektah are doing including a track with Nore which is Hot as hell. I’d be cool with just one of those many albums being released, and I don’t mean the one with Primo, that would be too easy since Preem is actually releasing music so far this year.\n\n10. Nas and DJ Premier\n\nThis one comes up every time Nas drops an album and anytime Primo speaks and say he’s talked to Nas. From what Primo says and I’ve heard him say it many times it’s all on Nas. I was glad they didn’t connect on the last few Nas albums as those albums had a theme, not saying Primo wouldn’t have fit in with the scheme of things at all. I’m saying for these two to get together you need that magic where the connection feels right. An album with these two wouldn’t even need to be an album, fuck I’d take and EP. I hope they do it and neither man says anything and out of the blue on Live From Headqcourterz two songs play from the upcoming album and like that the wait begins… All over again.\n\nLet’s go back to 1992 and a nice little catchy single dropped entitled “Who Got Da Props”. It’s crazy because even back then between that single and Showbiz & AGs’ “Soul Clap” you had essentially hardcore songs on the radio with a catchy hook. Back to what would be the start of a movement that has been in motion for fifteen years now. Black Moon dropped that now classic track in all honesty was the admired by so many people for what they did. Not the fact they got radio love for the song and did mad TV gigs with, but the fact that when you actually picked up Enter Da Stage in 1993 that was the “softest” song on the album. Once “How Many MCs” dropped Buckshot (Black Moons’ main rapper) dropped the “shorty” in his name the song was just the illest shit in general. Some people couldn’t believe it was the same crew. From that album we were introduced to BCC (Boot Camp Clik) and way of spelling that only Boot Camp could get away with. After Black Moon we were treated to Smif –N – Wessun, Heltah Skeltah and OGC (Originoo Gunn Clappaz) also the birth of Duck Down Entaprizez in 1995, told they had the game going crazy with they way they spelled stuff..\n\nTo me Boot Camp Clik survived with a lot of bumps and bruises but also remained their integrity unlike so many of the heavy weight crews that made an impression around the same time and after like, Wu (Tang Clan), Da Click, No Limit, Hot Boys, Ruff Ryders, Flip Mode (Squad), Tha Likwit Crew, Death Row and Bad Boy labels. All those crews have fallen apart at some point for some reason and Boot Camp remained strong and only really lost Rock who has shown up on Sean Price albums and mixtapes.\n\nFrom the fall out with Nervous records, the label that signed Black Moon and Smif- N – Wessun, Buckshot and Dru Ha, who worked at Nervous at the time, came together and formed Duck Down Records. As a label they’ve went above and beyond what a lot of the more mainstream labels and artists have done. Duck Down has worked out a deal with having their music connected with everything from Ekco clothing to ESPN college sports broadcast programs with no platinum mainstream artist on their roster at all. The label was one of the first to setup a channel on youtube. Hell not many people know they were on the verge of signing of Eminem in 97’ but from what I read Priority didn’t want to take that chance of signing a “white rapper” Could you imagine Em spitting to some bass heavy, dirty drum Beatminerz beats?\n\nDuck Down records has really had the underground on lock since 2000. From the highly consistent Sean Price (formally known as Ruck from the group Heltah Skeltah) and having MCs like Torea and Skyzoo be considered two of the better MCs in the game right now the label is also home to Canadian producer Marco Polo, 9th Wonder, Kidz In The Hall and now KRS. Duck Down is really a label that has the patentail to be a major force if Buck and Dru chooses to. They won’t do it if it means waterting down not just the sound but the ideal of what makes the label what it is. It’s cool to see an independent label these days still stay indepecdent when other labels merge with one of the three major labels for more exsposure. Not to take anything from Duck Down at all but many people back in the day would have thought Death Row and or Bad Boy, hell Loud Records would be the label celebrating such a wonderful sense of accomplishments and . longevity Again as a independent Hip Hop label goes that came together in the 90’s that hasn’t had to some how sellout to get a bigger audience and still make moves on a commercail level here and there is a testament to how Buck and Dru work. I been fan since I first “Who Got Da Props” and hope to be speaking on the labels twentieth birthday in five years. Happy fifteenth Duck Down and those who are envoled."
