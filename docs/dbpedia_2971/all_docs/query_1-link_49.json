        "text": "AIMS Marketing Program/ Featured Titles Promoted This Week:\n\nAdeem The Artist – Anniversary CD/LP (Four Quarters)\n\nAnniversary is the new studio album from critically acclaimed artist Adeem The Artist. The album was produced by Butch Walker who has produced hits for artists including Weezer, Fall Out Boy, Pink, Katy Perry, Panic! At The Disco, Dashboard Confessional, Avril Lavigne and many others. This record is the continuation of a project that they began four years ago, directing their attention both inwards & outwards simultaneously and to exact correlating values so that they might be able to unbind the inner workings of themself while imagining new tools for stitching the fabric of society together again. It mostly just made some gay people like country music again. [A metallic silver color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nImperial Triumphant – Vile Luxury (Redux 1924) CD/LP (Century Media)\n\nWhen New York’s Imperial Triumphant released Vile Luxury in 2018, it set a new standard for the possibilities of extreme music. Since then, the three-piece band has taken their signature sound, equally rooted in eclectic black metal, the most claustrophobic notions of free jazz, and the concept of urban cityscapes as canyons of horror and cemented their status with tours alongside the likes of Behemoth, Zeal & Ardor, and Voivod. Now, Imperial Triumphant returns with a fresh look at Vile Luxury, which has been remixed and remastered by longtime contributor Colin Marston (Krallice, Gorguts), allowing new dimensions of this work-often considered Imperial Triumphant at their most accessible-of stygian dimensions and monolithic intents to seep through. [A blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Lemon Twigs – A Dream Is All We Know CD/LP (Captured Tracks)\n\nSince the release of their debut studio album Do Hollywood (4AD) in 2016, The Lemon Twigs – the New York City rock band fronted by brothers Brian (27) and Michael D’Addario (25) – have waved the same revivalist torch as Alex Chilton and his Big Star crew, working to prove that archaic music from the ’60s and ’70s can still be relevant in digital world. Alongside peers like Foxygen and Drugdealer, The Lemon Twigs have explicitly documented a synchronistic blend of contemporary narrative motifs, old-school recording techniques, and flawless, consistent attitudes collaged from various crucial stages of rock ‘n’ roll. After a whirlwind 2023, the D’Addarios are continuing the momentum of their own evolving vision and voice, distilling a history lesson of baroque and power pop into A Dream Is All We Know. [Several colorways are available on vinyl, including ‘ice cream white’.]\n\nDua Lipa – Radical Optimism CD/LP (WB)\n\nInspired by Dua’s own self-discovery, Radical Optimism is an album that taps into the pure joy and happiness of having clarity in situations that once seemed impossible to face. The hard goodbyes and vulnerable beginnings that previously threatened to crush your soul, become milestones as you choose optimism and start to move with grace through the chaos. Infused with the energy of Dua’s hometown, London, the attitude of the album embodies the rawness, honesty, confidence, and freedom of ’90s Britpop. Radical Optimism transports its listener to a dreamy pop world rich in musicality, lyrically unapologetic and sonically liberating. [Several colorways are available, including clear; and indie store exclusive red.]\n\nMdou Moctar – Funeral For Justice CD/LP (Matador)\n\nFuneral For Justice is the new album by Mdou Moctar. Recorded at the close of two years spent touring the globe following the release of 2019 breakout Afrique Victime, it captures the Nigerien quartet in ferocious form. The music is louder, faster, and wilder. The guitar solos are feedback-scorched, and the lyrics are passionately political. Nothing is held back or toned down. The songs on Funeral For Justice speak unflinchingly to the plight of Niger and of the Tuareg people. “This album is really different for me,” explains Moctar, the band’s singer, namesake, and indisputably iconic guitarist. “Now the problems of terrorist violence are more serious in Africa. When the US and Europe came here, they said they’re going to help us, but what we see is really different. They never help us to find a solution.”\n\nEmily Nenni – Drive & Cry CD/LP (New West)\n\nEmily Nenni has written a follow-up to 2022’s critically acclaimed record, On The Ranch. Her debut album garnered her much success and introduced her to a devoted audience of music fans who celebrate the traditional side of country music while embracing the modern indie aesthetic that comes with that nod to the past. While writing her latest record, Drive & Cry, Nenni looked in the rearview mirror for inspiration but kept focus on the sound that she has become known for. “This is the first record I have completely written on my own. I spent a good bit of solitary time ruminating on things that had happened over the last year or two. Rethinking what I’m doing, how I’m doing it, who with, even in just the everyday. Change is hard but also such a gift.” Nenni worked with producer John James Tourville (The Deslondes, Sunny War) to broaden her sound and bring nuance to the recording. The record was engineered by Jake Davis and mixed by Matt Ross-Spang in Memphis, TN. The resulting recording is a mature country sound that focuses on the fun and the tears that come with all changes in life. [An indie store exclusive autographed clear/pink color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSia – Reasonable Woman CD/LP (Atlantic)\n\nReasonable Woman is Sia’s first proper album since 2016 and is so filled to the brim with pop perfection, it almost overwhelms with how effortless it is for her to craft such instantly connectable songs. The collection is everything Sia does best, and the sonic equivalent of a myriad of things: an empowering embrace, secrets told late at night, going to the best party in the world, the vulnerability of declaring you love someone, the steadfast determination to keep going, even if your love isn’t returned; the messiness of being human; the exuberance of being human. In essence, it is life – happening to us, happening for us; the songs on Reasonable Woman mirror back to us being alive with every chorus. [A baby pink color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nFrank Turner – Undefeated CD/2xCD/LP (Xtra Mile)\n\n“Undefeated is my tenth solo studio album, and in many ways, I’m pleasantly surprised by that statement. I feel very fortunate that I’m still making records and touring – fortunate and proud. The record is fired by that feeling, and a new sense of energy and liberation. It feels like a new chapter for me – after the pandemic, back in the independent world, the new lineup of the Sleeping Souls, and a slightly bewildered sense of gratitude that I’m still standing, still have something to say.” – Frank Turner [An indie store exclusive purple color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nKamasi Washington – Fearless Movement CD/2xLP (Young)\n\nKamasi Washington calls Fearless Movement his dance album. “It’s not literal,” Washington says. “Dance is movement and expression, and in a way it’s the same thing as music—expressing your spirit through your body. That’s what this album is pushing.” Dance as an embodied form of expression signals a shift in focus for Washington. Where previous albums dealt with cosmic ideas and existential concepts, Fearless Movement focuses on the everyday, an exploration of life on earth. This change in scope is due in large part to the birth of Washington’s first child a few years ago. The album features Washington’s daughter—who wrote the melody to “Asha The First” during some of her first experimentations on the piano—as well as a host of collaborators new and old. André 3000 appears on flute, George Clinton lends his voice, as do BJ The Chicago Kid, Inglewood rapper D-Smoke and Taj and Ras Austin of Coast Contra, the twin sons of West Coast legend Ras Kass. Washington further enlisted lifelong friends and collaborators Thundercat, Terrace Martin, Patrice Quinn, Brandon Coleman, DJ Battlecat and more. [An indie store exclusive red and blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nWILLOW – empathogen CD/LP (Three Six Zero/Gamma.)\n\nempathogen is the sixth studio album from WILLOW. This release sees WILLOW moving in a new alternative and jazz-tinged direction following her widely praised 2022 release <COPINGMECHANISM>. The album includes features from Jon Batiste and St. Vincent. “Willow‘s inner emotions spill over on her latest single, ‘Big Feelings,’ stylized as ‘b i g f e e l i n g s’ on the tracklist for the musician’s new studio album empathogen. ‘The piano part of this song is so dense and dissonant but also darkly beautiful,’ Willow shared in a statement. ‘I wrote ‘b i g f e e l i n g s’ during a week where I was coming to terms with my own emotional patterns that I hadn’t known were there. Musically, it has a darkness and complexity that reflects what we all experience in our own minds.’ “empathogen marks Willow’s first studio album in nearly two years, following 2022’s Coping Mechanism. She first began unveiling the record last month when she shared ‘Symptom Of Life,’ which she described in a statement, saying: “The song has a very beautiful whimsical nature but holds a lot of mystery. There’s this beautiful light coming in through the piano, but also this syncopated rhythm of the bass, bringing in that mysterious element. A juxtaposition of light and dark. Both songs capture Willow on her own, through two collaborations will appear on the album. Jon Batiste joins her on empathogen‘s opening track ‘Home’, while St. Vincent appears on ‘Pain For Fun’. The track list for the record suggests more mystery and emotional exploration with titles like “The Fear Is Not Real” and “Run!”. [A brown color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nCharlotte Day Wilson – Cyan Blue CD/LP (XL)\n\nToronto-born-and-raised singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Charlotte Day Wilson announces her highly anticipated sophomore album Cyan Blue. Cyan Blue finds Wilson crafting a smoothly woven cyan tapestry of her eternal influences: thumping gospel piano, warm soul basslines, atmospheric electronics, and penetrating R&B melodies. Yet, it possesses a sense of vastness that rings in a new era for Wilson, one in which she’s embracing collaboration and newfound creative openness tinged with wistfulness and yearning and a reflection on youthful innocence. “I want to look through the unjaded eyes of my younger self again,” Wilson explains of making Cyan Blue. “Before there wasn’t as much baggage, before so much life was lived. But I also wish that my younger self could see where I am now. It would be nice to be able to impart some of the wisdom and clarity that I have now onto her.” [A translucent green color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nAdditional Social Media Program Titles:\n\nDeath Lens – Cold World LP (Epitaph)\n\nDeath Lens relentlessly seeks a place in your consciousness, a persistent presence whispering in your ear. Concealing ferocity beneath a stylish veneer, their live shows unleash energy and chaos, leaving spectators disarmed and forever transformed. On record, Death Lens forges unyielding rock, blending West Coast surf punk with Britrock’s tight, bouncy rhythms. Despite their deceptive chill and vibe-focused portrayal, live performances brim with hardcore intensity. Rooted in slick guitar sonics and sugary backing vocal harmonies, reminiscent of indie punk and shoegaze, Death Lens channels the energy of bands like Turnstile and Militarie Gun on stage, creating soundtracks for indelible memories of high-energy, sweat-soaked singalongs. [An indie store exclusive clear w/ black splatter color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nKarate Boogaloo – Hold Your Horses CD/LP (Colemine)\n\nSitting at the core of Melbourne’s burgeoning movement of cinematic instrumental soul, Karate Boogaloo’s roots go deep into the fabric of the DIY soul idiom. A mainstay of the Melbourne underground over the last decade, their now sought-after series of LPs delving into hip-hop sample culture and its relationship to funk music, The ‘KB’s Mixtapes’, are evidence of their long-standing contribution to the development of the Melbourne cinematic soul sound. Hold Your Horses is a mesmerizing new long-playing disc of original instrumental tunes [A camo green colorway is available.]\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\n94 East featuring Prince – Dance To The Music Of The World CD/LP (Charly)\n\n“Dance To The Music Of The World” is the fifth track on 94 East’s first collection of studio recordings Minneapolis Genius, featuring Prince on drums, guitar and synthesizer. A preliminary version of the song was recorded in Summer 1978 at Sound 80, Minneapolis, Minnesota (during the same set of sessions as “Lovin’ Cup” and “Just Another Sucker”). As with the other tracks included on Minneapolis Genius, additional recording was done by Pepé Willie at Blue Wave Recording Studio, St. Philip, Barbados. The original 1978 version remains unreleased. In 1995, two versions (the Minneapolis Genius overdubbed version and a rehearsal take from 1978) were included on Symbolic Beginning (re-released in 1999 as The Early Years, in 2000 as One Man Jam and in 2020 on 94 East Featuring Prince).\n\nChantal Acda & The Atlantic Drifters – Silently Held CD (Challenge Classics)\n\nSilently Held comes to life with the collaborative brilliance of accomplished musicians. Bill Frisell with his beautiful understanding of Chantal’s flow of melody, Eric Thielemans who brings his percussive mastery to the mix. Jozef Dumoulin playing the piano with immense calm. Thomas Morgan’s, who seems to be picking magic out of the skies with his bass and Shahzad Ismaily’s golden touch as a multi-instrumentalist contribute to the album’s rich texture. Colin Stetson, renowned for his avant-garde saxophone work but also his work for Bon Iver, lends his unique voice, creating moments of emotive intensity. In the quiet embrace of the music, Chantal unveils a raw and authentic portrayal of vulnerability, where every flaw and feeling is held close. The album becomes a sanctuary, inviting listeners to join in this silent communion with the intricacies of the human experience. [Vinyl version due May 17.]\n\nAdeem The Artist – Anniversary CD/LP (Four Quarters)\n\nAnniversary is the new studio album from critically acclaimed artist Adeem The Artist. The album was produced by Butch Walker who has produced hits for artists including Weezer, Fall Out Boy, Pink, Katy Perry, Panic! At The Disco, Dashboard Confessional, Avril Lavigne and many others. This record is the continuation of a project that they began four years ago, directing their attention both inwards & outwards simultaneously and to exact correlating values so that they might be able to unbind the inner workings of themself while imagining new tools for stitching the fabric of society together again. It mostly just made some gay people like country music again. [A metallic silver color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nOlli Ahvenlahti – Mirror Mirror CD/LP (We Jazz)\n\nMirror Mirror is the new album by the Finnish jazz legend, pianist/composer Olli Ahvenlahti. Championed by the likes of Gilles Peterson and Kenny Dope, Ahvenlahti is a master of hard-grooving jazz funk. Here, he continues the evolution of his style, much beloved since the legendary 1970s albums such as The Poet and Countenance.\n\nArt Ensemble Of Chicago – A Jackson In Your House Plus LP (Charly)\n\nA Jackson in Your House is the first of The Art Ensemble of Chicago’s renowned trio of albums for BYG’s Actuel series. This album is The Art Ensemble’s most celebrated release and finds the American avant-garde jazz collective at their most sensational, mocking, and startling original best in a session from June 1969, at Studio Saravah, in Paris. Recorded during the aftermath of widespread antigovernmental protests and student riots, it demonstrates what can happen when four highly intuitive and accomplished musicians, fired by Black Nationalism and dreams of liberation and with an array of diverse instruments at their disposal, allow their inspiration free rein.\n\nKee Avil – Spine CD/LP (Constellation)\n\nWith Spine, Kee Avil strips back her heavily textured compositions, opening a much rawer sound. She calls it folk-and while traditionalists might scoff, this is urgent music that reflects the precarity of modern life, as well as the jarring mixture of electronic and real-world interactions that have become the fabric of our day-to-day experiences. There’s a hypnotic post-punk somnambulance to it all, using the repetition and fracturing of melodic phrases interwoven with delicate electronics to create curious and persistent hooks. While not a concept album, themes of time’s passage, remembrance, and decay crop up across multiple tracks. Each track intentionally only has four elements-guitar, electronics, and two other instruments, with Kee’s voice and guitar pushed to the front.\n\nEmily Barker – Fragile As Humans CD/LP (Everyone Sang)\n\nOn her new album, Fragile as Humans – written and recorded as her time living in the UK was ending – Emily Barker turns her lyrical gaze inwards. The expansive themes of her previous album A Dark Murmuration Of Words are replaced by an empathetic concern for matters more personal, familial, closer to home. The ten songs take us on a deep dive into the human condition, an unflinching self-examination of grief, pain, loneliness, and loss, at the same time sparkling with hope and optimism. [A purple color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBetter Than Ezra – Super Magick CD (Round Hill)\n\nBetter Than Ezra is still going strong: after headlining monumental live shows all throughout 2023, the band is now releases their highly anticipated tenth studio album, Super Magick. [Vinyl version due June 14.]\n\nBroadcast – Spell Blanket – Collected Demos 2006-2009 CD/2xLP+MP3 (Warp)\n\nSpell Blanket – Collected Demos 2006-2009 comprises songs and sketches drawn from Trish’s extensive archive of 4-track tapes and MiniDiscs. The recordings lay the groundwork for what would have been Broadcast’s fifth album, offering a window into Trish and James’ creative process during the post-Tender Buttons period from 2006-2009. The photography used in its artwork is by Trish and James and the artwork is designed by Broadcast’s long-time collaborator Julian House.\n\nBrume – Marten CD/LP (Magnetic Eye)\n\nBrume (pronounced ‘Broom’) are living proof that California is not all sunshine and easy living. The San Francisco-based quartet organically blends doom metal, goth, and indie rock into a sometimes monolithic, and at other times delicate blend of heaviness that resides firmly on the darker side. [Multiple vinyl colorways are available.]\n\nBuzzcocks – Live At The Shepherds Bush Empire CD+DVD/2xLP+DVD (Secret)\n\nThis fantastic double album set captures Buzzcocks live at the Shepherds Bush Empire in 2003 as they careen through 32 of their finest two and three-minute punk-love spurts. Featuring founder member Pete Shelley & Steve Diggle on guitar and vocals plus Tony Barber on bass and Philip Barker on drums. Includes a bonus DVD of the full concert, interviews with Pete & Steve, sound check and other extras.\n\nCamera Obscura – Look To The East, Look To The West CD/LP+MP3 (Merge)\n\nLook To The East, Look To The West is Camera Obscura at their best and most evocative. Reuniting with producer Jari Haapalainen (Let’s Get Out Of This Country, My Maudlin Career), Camera Obscura have crafted an album that simultaneously recalls why longtime fans have ferociously loved them for decades, while also being their most sophisticated effort to date. The lead single “Big Love” relishes in the space between country rock and prog, a pining break-up anthem featuring the soaring pedal steel of Tim Davidson. [An indie store exclusive blue w/ white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nJohn Carpenter – Lost Themes IV: Noir CD/LP (Sacred Bones)\n\nIt’s been a decade since John Carpenter recorded the material that would become Lost Themes, his debut album of non-film music and the opening salvo in one of Hollywood’s great second acts. Those vibrant, synth-driven songs, made in collaboration with his son Cody Carpenter and godson Daniel Davies, kickstarted a musical renaissance for the pioneering composer and director. In the years since, Carpenter, Carpenter, and Davies have released close to a dozen musical projects, including a growing library of studio albums and the scores for David Gordon Green’s trilogy of Halloween reboots. With Lost Themes IV: Noir, they’ve struck gold again, this time mining the rich history of the film noir genre for inspiration. [Multiple vinyl colorways are available, including an indie store exclusive tan/black marbled pressing.]\n\nRachel Chinouriri – What A Devastating Turn Of Events CD (Elektra)\n\nAlternative indie pop artist Rachel Chinouriri’s long-awaited debut album What A Devastating Turn Of Events is a culmination of the experiences, challenges and joys of Chinouriri’s life so far, explored through the prism of musical stylings honed through years of experimentation and creation. Ever eclectic and brutally honest, the album traverses life’s light and shade, the writing and sharing a healing process for Rachel, and she hopes, her listeners. [An indie store exclusive color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDabeull – Analog Love CD/LP/LP+10” (Roche Musique)\n\nAnalog Love is Dabeull’s first proper full-length album after several key releases, including Intimate Fonk, Fonk Delight, and the highly sought-after compilation, InDaStudio. For Dabeull, analog production is his favorite playground as evidenced by this new nine-track album which was recorded using Michael Jackson’s Thriller console. [An indie store exclusive clear vinyl pressing featuring a bonus two-track 10” is available.]\n\nMichelle David & The True-Tones – Brothers & Sisters CD/LP (Record Kicks)\n\nRaised in New York in a church, Michelle David started singing at the age of four and joined her first group, The Mission of Love, when she was five. During her career, she toured the world with Broadway musical Mama, contributed to successful theatre shows such as The Sound Of Motown, Glory Of Gospel and Mahalia and recorded for artists such as Diana Ross and Michael Bolton. This all happened before releasing six critically acclaimed gospel-infused albums with the True-Tones. Michelle David (vocals), Paul Willemsen (guitars, organ, percussion, backing vocals), Onno Smit (guitars and backing vocals) and Bas Bouma (drums, percussion) form a tight-knit unit that seamlessly blends their individual talents, resulting in the distinctive sound that defines Michelle David & the True-Tones. The band’s instrumentation, characterized by groovy basslines, and Michelle David’s powerhouse vocals, becomes a vibrant tapestry in the studio setting. The prominent addition of horns on the album brings a dynamic dimension to the songs, adding layers of texture and a sense of grandeur to the band’s already compelling sound.\n\nDavid J – Tracks From The Attic 3xCD/3xLP+3xCD (Independent Project)\n\nAttics have always exerted an irresistible allure on David J’s imagination. They can unveil luminous jewels that time and dust made seem lost. With Tracks From The Attic, the Bauhaus and Love and Rockets co-founder invites us to join him and climb up the ladder. A most fascinating journey ensues – we’re looking through boxes of tapes, getting reacquainted with an artist we’ve known for a long time – yet the intimate songs he recorded in solitary over three decades reveal new sides to him.\n\nDesmond Dekker – Live At Basin’s Nightclub 1987 CD/LP (Burning Sounds)\n\nPreviously unreleased album Recorded Live at Basins Nightclub in February 1987; 12 songs including the hits that made Desmond Dekker an international reggae star.\n\nFM – Old Habits Die Hard CD (Frontiers)\n\nNew release from the British AOR band.\n\nHall Aflame – Amplifire CD/LP (Rat Pak)\n\nHall Aflame, the rock band which features Metal Church founding guitarist Kurdt Vanderhoof, releases their long-awaited sophomore album, Amplifire. [A color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nHarvestman – Triptych: Part One CD (Neurot Recordings)\n\nThe first of a three-album cycle, Triptych: Part One, is Harvestman’s most ambitious undertaking yet. Drawn to the megaliths, ruins and ancient sites mapped out along the British and European mainland’s geographical and psychic landscapes, the folklore and apocrypha forever resurfacing as portals from a rational world, Triptych is a meditation forged from traces and residues, and a hallucinatory recollection of artists who have tapped into that enduring otherworldliness embedded within us all. It’s a dream diary narrating a passage through Summer Isle where Flying Saucer Attack are wafting out of a window, a distant Fairport Convention are being remixed by dub master Adrian Sherwood, celestial scanners Tangerine Dream are trying to drown out Bert Jansch and Hawkwind are playing Steeleye Span covers, comprised out of time yet bound to its singularity. [Vinyl version due May 17.]\n\nSteve Hillage – Düsseldorf 2xCD (Madfish UK)\n\nSome gigs are simply meant to be out there – even if they take decades to make it into our hands. This is, without doubt, one of those concerts; recorded at the Philips Halle, Düsseldorf on March 28,1979, during the Live Herald Tour. Released following the AIM-nominated deluxe box set from Hillage, Searching For The Spark, the Dusselsdorf double-CD showcases the Steve Hillage Band’s prowess with excellent sound quality.\n\nIbibio Sound Machine – Pull The Rope CD/LP+MP3 (Merge)\n\nPull The Rope by Ibibio Sound Machine casts the Eno Williams and Max Grunhard-led outfit in a new light. The hope, joy, and sexiness of their music remain, but further honing the edge of their acclaimed 2022 album Electricity, the connection they aim to foster has shifted venues from the sunny buoyancy of a sunlit festival to a sweat-soaked, all-night dance club. Williams and Grunhard attribute this shift to a matter of collaborators, recording Pull the Rope with Sheffield-based producer Ross Orton (Arctic Monkeys, M.I.A.) over the course of two weeks. The way the pair wrote songs changed significantly-rather than Eno penning lyrics to music generated by Max and company’s jamming, Orton started with Eno and Max writing together before adding the band. With less time in the studio and a new way of considering how they built songs, the duo found making decisions about Pull the Rope’s sound quicker and more instinctual than before. [An indie store exclusive black w/ blue & red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nImperial Triumphant – Vile Luxury (Redux 1924) CD/LP (Century Media)\n\nWhen New York’s Imperial Triumphant released Vile Luxury in 2018, it set a new standard for the possibilities of extreme music. Since then, the three-piece band has taken their signature sound, equally rooted in eclectic black metal, the most claustrophobic notions of free jazz, and the concept of urban cityscapes as canyons of horror and cemented their status with tours alongside the likes of Behemoth, Zeal & Ardor, and Voivod. Now, Imperial Triumphant returns with a fresh look at Vile Luxury, which has been remixed and remastered by longtime contributor Colin Marston (Krallice, Gorguts), allowing new dimensions of this work-often considered Imperial Triumphant at their most accessible-of stygian dimensions and monolithic intents to seep through. [A blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nGoran Kajfes Tropiques – Tell Us CD/LP (We Jazz)\n\nTell Us, an album consisting of three long pieces composed by the group, is “slow music” to the bone, a deep body of work utilizing the language of jazz as its core mode of communication but echoing way beyond. The quartet is expanded with strings, adding wings to the music and helping it lift off the ground in a personal, highly engaging manner. [A red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nKarate Boogaloo – Hold Your Horses CD/LP (Colemine)\n\nSitting at the core of Melbourne’s burgeoning movement of cinematic instrumental soul, Karate Boogaloo’s roots go deep into the fabric of the DIY soul idiom. A mainstay of the Melbourne underground over the last decade, their now sought-after series of LPs delving into hip-hop sample culture and its relationship to funk music, The ‘KB’s Mixtapes’, are evidence of their long-standing contribution to the development of the Melbourne cinematic soul sound. Hold Your Horses is a mesmerizing new long-playing disc of original instrumental tunes [A camo green colorway is available.]\n\nWill Kimbrough – For The Life Of Me CD/LP (Will Kimbrough)\n\n“During the writing of For The Life Of Me, I was in love with the human race. I was angry with the human race. I was delighted by the human race. I was disappointed in the human race. I was stuck at home during the pandemic shutdown. I was on the road 200 days a year again in Spring 2021. My eyes, ears and heart were open. I wrote it down and sang it out.”\n\nKitchen Dwellers – Seven Devils CD/LP (No Coincidence)\n\nThe Kitchen Dwellers invite you to join them on an extraordinary journey with their highly anticipated fourth studio album, Seven Devils. Produced by Grammy winner Glenn Brown (Billy Strings, Greensky Bluegrass), the ascending Montana quartet continues to redefine the boundaries of bluegrass, folk, and rock. [An orange color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Lemon Twigs – A Dream Is All We Know CD/LP (Captured Tracks)\n\nSince the release of their debut studio album Do Hollywood (4AD) in 2016, The Lemon Twigs – the New York City rock band fronted by brothers Brian (27) and Michael D’Addario (25) – have waved the same revivalist torch as Alex Chilton and his Big Star crew, working to prove that archaic music from the ’60s and ’70s can still be relevant in digital world. Alongside peers like Foxygen and Drugdealer, The Lemon Twigs have explicitly documented a synchronistic blend of contemporary narrative motifs, old-school recording techniques, and flawless, consistent attitudes collaged from various crucial stages of rock ‘n’ roll. After a whirlwind 2023, the D’Addarios are continuing the momentum of their own evolving vision and voice, distilling a history lesson of baroque and power pop into A Dream Is All We Know. [Several colorways are available on vinyl, including ‘ice cream white’.]\n\nDua Lipa – Radical Optimism CD/LP (WB)\n\nInspired by Dua’s own self-discovery, Radical Optimism is an album that taps into the pure joy and happiness of having clarity in situations that once seemed impossible to face. The hard goodbyes and vulnerable beginnings that previously threatened to crush your soul, become milestones as you choose optimism and start to move with grace through the chaos. Infused with the energy of Dua’s hometown, London, the attitude of the album embodies the rawness, honesty, confidence, and freedom of ’90s Britpop. Radical Optimism transports its listener to a dreamy pop world rich in musicality, lyrically unapologetic and sonically liberating. [Several colorways are available, including clear; and indie store exclusive red.]\n\nJohnny Marr – Adrenalin Baby [Reissue/2015] CD/2xLP (BMG)\n\nAdrenalin Baby was recorded live during the Playland tour in 2014. It includes live recordings predominantly from the iconic Manchester Apollo and Brixton Academy. Marr said he wanted to capture the atmosphere and feeling of the last couple of tours. It contains live versions of tracks from his solo records, “Playland”, “The Messenger”, whilst also including songs from earlier in his career, such as “Getting Away With It”. Adrenalin Baby also features several songs by The Smiths, such as “The Headmaster Ritual”, “How Soon Is Now” and “Bigmouth Strikes Again”. [A pink w/ black splatter color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nMeat Beat Manifesto – Extinct CD (Cold Spring UK)\n\nA unique collaboration between Industrial Breakbeat pioneers Meat Beat Manifesto (Jack Dangers) and the undisputed king of Japanese noise, Merzbow (Masami Akita). “We may not speak the same language, but in the vortex of sound, there’s a raw, primal understanding that transcends words. Noise can be art, a visual representation could maybe be Jackson Pollock’s No 5, a plexus of chaos redefining what music can and could be. Pushing boundaries with Masami wasn’t just a musical adventure, it was a masterclass in sonic anarchy.” – Jack Dangers, January 2024\n\nMdou Moctar – Funeral For Justice CD/LP (Matador)\n\nFuneral For Justice is the new album by Mdou Moctar. Recorded at the close of two years spent touring the globe following the release of 2019 breakout Afrique Victime, it captures the Nigerien quartet in ferocious form. The music is louder, faster, and wilder. The guitar solos are feedback-scorched, and the lyrics are passionately political. Nothing is held back or toned down. The songs on Funeral For Justice speak unflinchingly to the plight of Niger and of the Tuareg people. “This album is really different for me,” explains Moctar, the band’s singer, namesake, and indisputably iconic guitarist. “Now the problems of terrorist violence are more serious in Africa. When the US and Europe came here, they said they’re going to help us, but what we see is really different. They never help us to find a solution.”\n\nMorbid Angel – Gateways To Annihilation [Reissue/2000] CD (Earache)\n\nAfter enjoying worldwide success with the previous five classic albums, Morbid Angel had established themselves kings of the death metal genre with their revolutionary and unapologetic sound. Back in October 2000, Morbid Angel emphatically announced their return with Gateways To Annihilation – this intensely dark and intricate album is a historic masterpiece that emanates strength with its dynamic and sweeping passages and brutal lyrical content.\n\nNCT Dream – NCT Dream Dream()scape (Photo Book Ver.) CD (Sm Entertainment)\n\nNew release from the K-pop superstars.\n\nSandy Nelson – Drums À Go-Go [Reissue/1965] CD/LP (Sundazed)\n\nReleased at the crest of surf rock, Drums À Go-Go contains searing guitar work (“Casbah!”) – not to mention some of the most insanely indelible drum breaks – on record. [A green color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nEmily Nenni – Drive & Cry CD/LP (New West)\n\nEmily Nenni has written a follow-up to 2022’s critically acclaimed record, On The Ranch. Her debut album garnered her much success and introduced her to a devoted audience of music fans who celebrate the traditional side of country music while embracing the modern indie aesthetic that comes with that nod to the past. While writing her latest record, Drive & Cry, Nenni looked in the rearview mirror for inspiration but kept focus on the sound that she has become known for. “This is the first record I have completely written on my own. I spent a good bit of solitary time ruminating on things that had happened over the last year or two. Rethinking what I’m doing, how I’m doing it, who with, even in just the everyday. Change is hard but also such a gift.” Nenni worked with producer John James Tourville (The Deslondes, Sunny War) to broaden her sound and bring nuance to the recording. The record was engineered by Jake Davis and mixed by Matt Ross-Spang in Memphis, TN. The resulting recording is a mature country sound that focuses on the fun and the tears that come with all changes in life. [An indie store exclusive autographed clear/pink color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe Pineapple Thief – One Three Seven [Reissue/2001] CD (Kscope)\n\nThe Pineapple Thief’s 2001 album newly remixed and remastered featuring bonus track. An excellent entry point into the band’s early career, with songwriter, producer and solo artist extraordinaire Bruce Soord deftly balancing accessibility and a heavier sound for which The Pineapple Thief have become widely celebrated.\n\nJessica Pratt – Here In The Pitch CD/LP+MP3 (Mexican Summer)\n\nOn her fourth album, west coast artist Jessica Pratt expands the scope of her artistry, placing her sharpest songs to date within an ever-broadening pool of influences including spectral ’60s pop, Hollywood psychedelia and bossa nova. Whereas Pratt’s 2019 record, Quiet Signs, floated elegantly in the ether, Here In The Pitch is entrenched in more earthen characteristics, as the title suggests, and her craft is emboldened with a newfound gravitas. [A ‘panamint’ brown color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nPrincipe Valiente – In This Light CD (Metropolis)\n\nIn This Light is the name of the new full-length album by Principe Valiente and it signifies a bold evolution in the band’s decade-plus journey. The 10 meticulously crafted songs unveil the signature ethereal soundscape and dark ambient allure – elements that originally catapulted them onto the alternative scene back in 2011 with the release of their self-titled debut album. Immerse yourself in a symphony of mellotrons, samplers, and analog synths, harmonizing with the celestial resonance of Jimmy Ottosson’s Rickenbacker 12-string and Gretsch guitars, accompanied by the melodic piano, the distorted signature driving bass, all enveloped in the enigmatic vocals of singer Fernando Honorato. [Vinyl version due May 24.]\n\nRaekwon – Steven CD/LP (Father/Daughter)\n\n“Steven is the sound of me holding a mirror up to and critically reflecting on who I am: the good, the bad, the ugly. It’s about trying to understand the multitudes within me” – S. Raekwon. Steven Raekwon Reynolds performs as S. Raekwon, but his second LP is simply called Steven. Across ten tracks of furious and subtly strumming guitars, plodding bass riffs, and whispering revelations, S. Raekwon’s newest album strips back sonic and personal layers to present his most vulnerable, yet authentic self. [A white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDan Rincon – Spotlight City CD/LP (Castleface)\n\nDan Rincon’s (OSEES, Wild Thing, Apache, Personal and the Pizzas) premier solo release Spotlight City. Artificial landscapes and melodies comprised of Moog Grandmother, Mellotron and a kinky Modular system span from beautiful and lilting to haunting and ethereal. The album was a year’s long learning experience of getting all components and ingredients to link arms and blend comfortably. Wrangling was part of the process. Strings soaring and sines weaving. Sometimes in the atmosphere, sometimes in the Earth’s core, sometimes flanked by neon blur as it hums and weave patterns through a world imagined in vintage sci-fi pulp.\n\nRubel – As Palavras Vol 1. & 2 CD/2xLP (Mr Bongo)\n\nFrom the very first listen of Rubel’s Latin Grammy-nominated third album As Palavras, Vol. 1 & 2, you can feel its transformative force for the MPB genre. Here we see one of Rio’s brightest stars, fusing the contemporary with the classic, soaking up the richness of Brazil’s musical heritage. The result is a marauding 20-track epic, incorporating traditional styles such as forró, MPB, pagode and samba with modern baile funk, rasteirinha and hip-hop. [An indie store exclusive pink color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nKen Serio – Live…..In The Moment [Reissue/2007] 2xCD (Deko Music)\n\nKen Serio – Quartet Project CD (Deko Music)\n\nFor fans of Pat Metheny, Mike Stern, and jazz fusion.

CD (Pledis Entertainment)\n\nSeventeen – Seventeen Best Album ‘17 Is Right Here’ (HEAR Ver.) CD (Pledis Entertainment)\n\nSeventeen – Seventeen Best Album ‘17 Is Right Here’ (HERE Ver.) CD (Pledis Entertainment)\n\nNew best-of compilation album by the record-breaking K-pop superstars.\n\nSia – Reasonable Woman CD/LP (Atlantic)\n\nReasonable Woman is Sia’s first proper album since 2016 and is so filled to the brim with pop perfection, it almost overwhelms with how effortless it is for her to craft such instantly connectable songs. The collection is everything Sia does best, and the sonic equivalent of a myriad of things: an empowering embrace, secrets told late at night, going to the best party in the world, the vulnerability of declaring you love someone, the steadfast determination to keep going, even if your love isn’t returned; the messiness of being human; the exuberance of being human. In essence, it is life – happening to us, happening for us; the songs on Reasonable Woman mirror back to us being alive with every chorus. [A baby pink color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSilver Skylarks – The Number One Set And Sound CD/LP (Eastwood Music Group)\n\nSilver Skylarks debut album The Number One Set And Sound is a funky, hard-grooving excursion intent on releasing a “crate classic” into the world. Songwriter/musician Danny Balis (Bastards of Soul) and producer Jeff “Skin” Wade teamed up to turn several of Balis’ lockdown pandemic demos into the type of record that collectors/diggers, groove aficionados, DJ’s and hip-hop producers would be elated to discover and add to their crates. Rooted in the grooves and sonics of ’70s American R&B and West African funk with hints of afrobeat, dub, jazz and Latin soul – The Number One Set And Sound aims to work on the dancefloor as well as embody the sound that helped to launch B-Boy culture and the sample generation that fueled hip-hop, house and break-based music.\n\nChris Smither – All About The Bones CD (Signature Sounds)\n\nThe sound and imagery of Chris Smither’s 20th album is as elemental as the inky black shadows cast by a shockingly bright moon. The listener is welcomed into some gothic mansion on an imaginary New Orleans street, and there in the lamplit parlor confronts Smither’s inimitable propulsive guitar and rumbling baritone, joined seamlessly to producer David Goodrich’s carpetbag of instruments, Zak Trojano’s rock-steady drumming, BettySoo’s diaphanous harmony vocals, and the mournful flood of jazz legend Chris Cheek’s saxophone.\n\nOmar Souleyman – Erbil CD/LP (Mad Decent)\n\nOmar Souleyman’s fifth studio album Erbil pays homage to Erbil, Iraq – the city that offered solace and embraced Souleyman and his band during recent uneasy times. The move to Erbilcame rich with new experiences and friendships celebrated as Omar Souleyman knows best; in joyous song dedicated to this new chapter of life. Erbil‘s eight tracks see the Syrian wedding singer turned global electronic music icon again teaming up with his longtime keyboard player Hasan Jamo along for an ever ambitious and forward-thinking techno-meets-Dabke sound.\n\nSouthpaw – Drugstore Candy CD (Deko Music)\n\nOut of New Jersey comes 2023 Josie Awards County Group of the Year Southpaw. With a savory mix of country music simmered in rock, pop, and R&B influences, they serve up hooky lyrics, soul-power vocal and infectious melodies, supported by undeniable grooves and meticulous instrumental arrangements. [Vinyl version due May 24.]\n\nLuke Stewart Silt Trio – Unknown Rivers CD/LP (Pi Recordings)\n\nAn omnipresent and galvanizing force on the music scene, bassist Luke Stewart is a leader or co-leader of such bands as Irreversible Entanglements, Exposure Quintet, Blacks’ Myths, Heart of the Ghost, and Remembrance Quintet. He is also among the most in-demand collaborators, having performed with the likes of David Murray, Nicole Mitchell, Moor Mother, Jaimie Branch, Nate Wooley, Ken Vandermark, and countless others.\n\nTerminal Nation – Echoes Of The Devil’s Den CD/LP (20 Buck Spin)\n\nSince releasing the first Terminal Nation album Holocene Extinction in 2020, the USA’s simmering divisions have only widened, factions hardened, compromise disintegrated. The band’s incendiary new album Echoes Of The Devil’s Den epitomizes that boiling rage, once again appearing on the eve of a recurring nightmare election cycle of fossilized 20th century relics. The Terminal Nation battering ram has at its core outrageously heavy mid-paced riffing and bulldozing breakdowns, taken to new levels of extreme brutality, over which Stan Liszewski’s vocal venom radiates the seething anger of a population at wits end. [A red w/ orange color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nFrank Turner – Undefeated CD/2xCD/LP (Xtra Mile)\n\n“Undefeated is my tenth solo studio album, and in many ways, I’m pleasantly surprised by that statement. I feel very fortunate that I’m still making records and touring – fortunate and proud. The record is fired by that feeling, and a new sense of energy and liberation. It feels like a new chapter for me – after the pandemic, back in the independent world, the new lineup of the Sleeping Souls, and a slightly bewildered sense of gratitude that I’m still standing, still have something to say.” – Frank Turner [An indie store exclusive purple color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nTwiztid – Cryptic Collection 5 CD/2xLP (Majik Ninja)\n\nTwiztid’s Cryptic Collection 4 dropped way back in 2011 and finally the highly anticipated Cryptic Collection 5 is now available (including a double red, white and blue vinyl colorway).\n\nVarious Artists – Eccentric Soul: The Tammy Label LP (Numero)\n\nSilver colorway. Lost in the soot and fallout from Youngstown, Ohio’s infamous Black Monday steel industry collapse was Tony March’s cross-generational Tammy label. From its early days as a doo wop powerhouse to their last gasps chasing disco hits, Tammy unintentionally documented Youngstown’s small but prolific Black music scene. This single LP surveys the label’s best R&B, soul, funk, and disco, with 13 tracks from Ice Cold Love, Lynn Minor, J.C. & the Soul Angels, The Snapshots, Iron Knowledge, Roy Jefferson, and Steel City Band. Housed in a deluxe tip-on jacket, with a booklet crammed full of notes and ephemera, The Tammy Label continues Numero’s 20-year tradition of preserving regional Ohio music.\n\nVarious Artists – My Black Country: The Songs of Alice Randall CD (Oh Boy)\n\nMy Black Country: The Songs of Alice Randall is the companion album to Alice Randall’s new book My Black Country, which offers a lyrical, introspective, and unforgettable account of her past, her search for the first family of Black country music, and the radical joy in realizing the power of Black influence on American culture. The album is a powerful compilation of Black female country artists re-recording the greatest songs of Alice’s catalog, bringing to life the Black characters and portraits of the Black west embedded in her songs. The album is produced by Ebonie Smith (engineer of ‘Hamilton’, founder, and president of Gender Amplified, and the in-house producer for the Atlantic Records studio in New York).\n\nHana Vu – Romanticism CD/LP (Ghostly Int’l)\n\nHana Vu’s “contemplative indie-pop captures the disillusionment of young adulthood,” writes NME. Her new LP Romanticism furthers that sentiment as a coming-of-age work that mourns the impermanence of youth and searches for meaning. The acclaimed L.A.-born songwriter’s been making music since high school, with a full-length debut and several EPs behind her of glowy, brooding anthems of abstraction and emotion. With previous work, Vu welcomed feedback as she went, but while crafting Romanticism, she shielded herself from outside opinion to preserve a singular vision. The result is a unified collection of songs aching with depth and intimacy. Lush and loud, the songs can feel both reminiscent of guitar-heavy late-aughts indie rock, and expansively futuristic in its layered synth bass. [A ruby red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nKeith Wallen – Infinity Now CD/LP (Rise)\n\nNew release from the Breaking Benjamin/Adelitas Way/Copper guitarist and vocalist.\n\nKamasi Washington – Fearless Movement CD/2xLP (Young)\n\nKamasi Washington calls Fearless Movement his dance album. “It’s not literal,” Washington says. “Dance is movement and expression, and in a way it’s the same thing as music—expressing your spirit through your body. That’s what this album is pushing.” Dance as an embodied form of expression signals a shift in focus for Washington. Where previous albums dealt with cosmic ideas and existential concepts, Fearless Movement focuses on the everyday, an exploration of life on earth. This change in scope is due in large part to the birth of Washington’s first child a few years ago. The album features Washington’s daughter—who wrote the melody to “Asha The First” during some of her first experimentations on the piano—as well as a host of collaborators new and old. André 3000 appears on flute, George Clinton lends his voice, as do BJ The Chicago Kid, Inglewood rapper D-Smoke and Taj and Ras Austin of Coast Contra, the twin sons of West Coast legend Ras Kass. Washington further enlisted lifelong friends and collaborators Thundercat, Terrace Martin, Patrice Quinn, Brandon Coleman, DJ Battlecat and more. [An indie store exclusive red and blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nMaurice White – Manifestation CD (Omnivore)\n\nArchive release. The final recordings from the Earth, Wind & Fire founder, and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award-winner. Recorded with award-winning Producer Preston Glass. Includes six previously unissued tracks.\n\nWILLOW – empathogen CD/LP (Three Six Zero/Gamma.)\n\nempathogen is the sixth studio album from WILLOW. This release sees WILLOW moving in a new alternative and jazz-tinged direction following her widely praised 2022 release <COPINGMECHANISM>. The album includes features from Jon Batiste and St. Vincent. “Willow‘s inner emotions spill over on her latest single, ‘Big Feelings,’ stylized as ‘b i g f e e l i n g s’ on the tracklist for the musician’s new studio album empathogen. ‘The piano part of this song is so dense and dissonant but also darkly beautiful,’ Willow shared in a statement. ‘I wrote ‘b i g f e e l i n g s’ during a week where I was coming to terms with my own emotional patterns that I hadn’t known were there. Musically, it has a darkness and complexity that reflects what we all experience in our own minds.’ “empathogen marks Willow’s first studio album in nearly two years, following 2022’s Coping Mechanism. She first began unveiling the record last month when she shared ‘Symptom Of Life,’ which she described in a statement, saying: “The song has a very beautiful whimsical nature but holds a lot of mystery. There’s this beautiful light coming in through the piano, but also this syncopated rhythm of the bass, bringing in that mysterious element. A juxtaposition of light and dark. Both songs capture Willow on her own, through two collaborations will appear on the album. Jon Batiste joins her on empathogen‘s opening track ‘Home’, while St. Vincent appears on ‘Pain For Fun’. The track list for the record suggests more mystery and emotional exploration with titles like “The Fear Is Not Real” and “Run!”. [A brown color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nCharlotte Day Wilson – Cyan Blue CD/LP (XL)\n\nToronto-born-and-raised singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Charlotte Day Wilson announces her highly anticipated sophomore album Cyan Blue. Cyan Blue finds Wilson crafting a smoothly woven cyan tapestry of her eternal influences: thumping gospel piano, warm soul basslines, atmospheric electronics, and penetrating R&B melodies. Yet, it possesses a sense of vastness that rings in a new era for Wilson, one in which she’s embracing collaboration and newfound creative openness tinged with wistfulness and yearning and a reflection on youthful innocence. “I want to look through the unjaded eyes of my younger self again,” Wilson explains of making Cyan Blue. “Before there wasn’t as much baggage, before so much life was lived. But I also wish that my younger self could see where I am now. It would be nice to be able to impart some of the wisdom and clarity that I have now onto her.” [A translucent green color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nWisp – Pandora CDEP (Interscope)\n\nFollowing her breakout single “Your face” that rocketed into view last summer amassing tens of millions of streams and attracting a cult fanbase eager to parse out Wisp’s mysterious social media presence – Wisp’s debut EP, Pandora, demonstrates intuitive understanding of songcraft and arrangement that continues to evolve. Inspired by the likes of Whirr and Deftones, Wisp has crafted a distinct and sophisticated sound that strives to realize the expansive possibilities of rock music. [Vinyl version due July 12.]\n\nThis Week’s Vinyl Exclusives:\n\nAgriculture – Living Is Easy / The Circle Chant 12”/Cassette (The Flenser)\n\nThe latest EP from ecstatic black metal band. [A cyan blue colorway is available.]\n\nBad Brains – Omega Session [Reissue/1997] 12” (Org Music)\n\nRed colorway. Omega Sessions is a five-song EP recorded by Bad Brains in 1980 and released in 1997. The tracks were recorded and mixed at the original Omega Recording Studios in Rockville, Maryland. The EP contains early versions of songs that eventually appeared on later releases, including a reading of “I Against I”. Side B of the LP features a custom etching.\n\nBambu Station – One Day [Reissue/2003] LP (Old Growth)\n\nIn 1996, St. Thomas’ own visionary Jalani Horton brought Bambu Station to life in Washington, DC. By 1999, this powerhouse band solidified with the arrival of drummer Andy Llanos and guitarist Tuff Lion, both hailing from St. Croix, USVI. Fueled by Horton’s mission to uplift through music, poetry, and action, One Day emerged in 2003, its poignant lyrics weaving tales of Africa’s legacy and the shared human experience.\n\nJeff Beck – Beck’s Blues LP (Charly)\n\nIn the summer of 1965 – in the midst of an era of great rock guitar hooks – Jeff Beck made his entrance (and what an entrance) with the bitingly unforgettable riff backbone to the Yardbirds’ biggest hit “Heart Full Of Soul”. It announced the debut of a guitar genius that posterity would soon rank with Clapton, Page, and Hendrix in the pantheon of rock guitar gods – not only for the ‘60s, but for the ages. The word “legend” doesn’t do Jeff Beck justice. In his long and fascinatingly erratic career, he covered many musical bases, his art ranging from viciously hard and heavy to transcendentally beautiful, everything perfectly played and straight from the heart.\n\nBen Quad – I’m Scared That’s All There Is LP (Wax Bodega)\n\nLava mix color vinyl. Ben Quad is a tightly wound emo outfit with just the right balance of delicate vulnerability, careening guitar-driven energy, and melodic ingenuity. Despite tongue-in-cheek proclamations of being “emo butt-rock,” the Oklahoma City-based quartet take their songcraft seriously, and the result is a vibrant chemical blend of winning sensitivity, a charming dash of goofiness, and propulsively hooky, cleverly written gems.\n\nBlushing – Sugarcoat LP (Kanine)\n\nRed colorway. Blushing’s unique brand of dreampop-infused indie rock hearkens back to the halcyon days of college radio. With a diverse array of influences including Elastica, Curve, Veruca Salt, Lush, The Breeders, and Smashing Pumpkins, Blushing manages a deftly executed eclecticism that recalls the best elements of alt rock’s past while retaining a vitality and immediacy that tethers them firmly to the present. On their recently completed third LP, Sugarcoat, Blushing’s dynamism is on full display, flitting effortlessly from spacey psychedelia to twee pop jangle with finesse and panache.\n\nThe Bolshoi – Country Life [Reissue/2015] 2xLP (Beggars Banquet)\n\nGreen and orange colorway. The Bolshoi released three albums during their existence, but they also recorded a fourth album that was never officially released during their tenure. Provisionally titled Country Life, it was released in 2015 as part of a limited 5xCD box set. Beggars are excited to now release it on vinyl for the first time. Country Life consists of demos recorded for the album, and many of these only survived on reference cassettes but were digitally restored. Beggars are especially thrilled that Trevor Tanner has recorded a brand-new acoustic reimagining of the song “Dolores Jones” made specifically for this release. The Bolshoi were different. Their songs were dark and subversive, sufficient evidence for many critics to corral them under the ‘Gothic’ banner at the time of their debut – but they only “flirted” with Goth. They oozed dark, pensive lyrics supported with inventive pop-goth guitar making them nearly impossible to categorize.\n\nBootcamp Clik – The Last Stand [Reissue/2006] LP (Duck Down)\n\nThe landmark 2006 album that showcased Brooklyn’s legendary hip-hop collective with their original lineup for the first time since their 1997 debut LP For The People. Buckshot, Smif-N-Wessun, Heltah Skeltah, and O.G.C. sound as raw as ever over a hall-of-fame production lineup including beats by Pete Rock, Large Professor, Da Beatminerz, 9th Wonder, Marco Polo, and more.\n\nBoundaries – Death Is A Little More LP (3 Dot Recordings)\n\nLight blue w/ orange crush splatter. Boundaries is a five-piece metalcore band based in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nElaine Brown/Black Panther Party – Seize The Time 2xLP (Real Gone Music)\n\nDeep purple colorway. Activist Elaine Brown became the first and only woman to lead the Black Panther Party in 1974. Blending influences ranging from Bob Dylan to classical and anchored by Elaine’s powerful delivery of her deeply felt lyrics, this album will stir your blood whether you agree with its politics or not.\n\nDonald Byrd – Byrd’s Eye View [Reissue/1956] LP (Blue Note)\n\nRecorded in 1955 for producer Tom Wilson’s short-lived Boston-based label Transition Records, Byrd’s Eye View was trumpeter Donald Byrd’s first issued recording as a leader. The date presented Byrd at the helm of what was then the current line-up of The Jazz Messengers with tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, pianist Horace Silver, bassist Doug Watkins, and drummer Art Blakey. Local Boston area trumpeter Joe Gordon joins the band for some friendly brass sparring with Byrd on several numbers, further adding to the album’s jovial air of a blowing session.\n\nCorrupted Ideals – Anti-Generation [Reissue/1993] LP (New Red Archives)\n\nFirst vinyl pressing of the third album from groundbreaking Long Beach punk band. Purple marbled colorway.\n\nCrash Course In Science – Near Marineland [Reissue/2011] LP (Dark Entries)\n\nDark Entries celebrates its 15th anniversary with legendary synth-punk deviants Crash Course In Science. Dale Feliciello, Mallory Yago, and Michael Zodorozny formed CCIS in 1979 after meeting at art school in Philadelphia. As a gesture born of equal parts punk irreverence and brute necessity, the band incorporated toy instruments and kitchen appliances into their aggressive, angular sound. Their anthems “Cardboard Lamb” and “Flying Turns” from 1981’s Signals From Pier Thirteen EP have been staples in adventurous DJ sets for over 40 years – yet some of their finest work is to be found on Near Marineland, a full-length LP recorded in 1981 but remained unreleased in its time. Near Marineland shows the band moving into more diverse and polished territory (although it’s still as abrasive as sandpaper).\n\nCulture – Two of Sevens Clash: The 30th Anniversary Edition LP (Shanachie)\n\nOne day Joseph Hill had a vision, while riding a bus, of 1977 as a year of judgement – when two sevens clash – when past injustices would be avenged, a vision rooted in prophecies made by Marcus Garvey. Lyrics and melodies came into his head as he rode and thus was born the song “Two Sevens Clash”, which became a massive hit in reggae circles both in Jamaica and abroad.\n\nDeath Lens – Cold World LP (Epitaph)\n\nDeath Lens relentlessly seeks a place in your consciousness, a persistent presence whispering in your ear. Concealing ferocity beneath a stylish veneer, their live shows unleash energy and chaos, leaving spectators disarmed and forever transformed. On record, Death Lens forges unyielding rock, blending West Coast surf punk with Britrock’s tight, bouncy rhythms. Despite their deceptive chill and vibe-focused portrayal, live performances brim with hardcore intensity. Rooted in slick guitar sonics and sugary backing vocal harmonies, reminiscent of indie punk and shoegaze, Death Lens channels the energy of bands like Turnstile and Militarie Gun on stage, creating soundtracks for indelible memories of high-energy, sweat-soaked singalongs. [An indie store exclusive clear w/ black splatter color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nDelta 5 – Singles & Sessions 1979-1981 LP (Kill Rock Stars)\n\nSeaglass blue colorway. The original members of Delta 5, Julz Sale (vocals/guitar), Ros Allen (bass) and Bethan Peters (bass), formed the band “on a lark”, but soon became a part of the thriving Leeds post-punk scene, and later added Kelvin Knight on drums and Alan Riggs on guitar. Combining feminist politics with a two-bass funk-punk sound (much in the style of another, more famous Leeds band, Gang of Four), they released in 1979 their debut single, “Mind Your Own Business”.\n\nDMX Crew – Unlikely Seeming LP (Byrd Out)\n\nAcclaimed UK electronic music producer, DMX Krew’s new album Unlikely Seeming showcases his blend of joyous, melodic synth hooks, textured pads and analogue drum machine rhythms. Leaving to one side pummeling sounds, the focus of this album is on sonic fun, mining the ’80s pop vibe DMX Krew does so well.\n\nKenny Dorham – This Is The Moment: Sings And Plays LP (Newland)\n\nKenny Dorham is one of the all-time great jazz trumpeters with a stellar catalog across the best jazz labels of the time. Starting out, he played in the big bands of Lionel Hampton, Billy Eckstine, Dizzy Gillespie, Mercer Ellington, and the quintet of Charlie Parker, as well as leading his own groups. Originally released on the great Riverside label, This Is The Moment: Sings And Plays was recorded at Reeves Sound Studio in New York between July 7 and August 15, 1958, and features his first public vocal performances. The band are scintillating, with Curtis Fuller on trombone, the debut of Cedar Walton on piano, Sam Jones on bass, and drum duties shared between Charlie Persip and G.T. Hogan.\n\nEarthless – From The West LP (Silver Current)\n\nColor vinyl pressing. On the eve of the release of Black Heaven, Earthless turned in this incredible live performance in San Francisco on March 1, 2018. Since their inception seventeen years ago, this band has become an icon of 21st century heavy music and a cult unto themselves. On From The West the band’s signature high-volume drive and unbridled horsepower create an almost mantra-like repetition as a framework for infinite improvisation. That, and beer-can crushing, fist-pumping riffs and solos delivered by an unstoppable rhythm section. This album is a complete, hypnotic, psychedelic experience in a way that remains totally unique to the band’s virtuosic expression.\n\nThe Exciters – Black Beauty [Reissue/1971] LP (Survival Research)\n\nStarting out as the Masterettes, a girl group formed by high school friends Brenda Reid, Carol Johnson, Lillian Walker, and Sylvia Wilbur, the group switched focus and changed name after Wilbur was replaced by Brenda Reid’s husband, Herb Rooney, their breakthrough hit Tell Him appearing in 1963 after Leiber & Stoller took charge. 1971’s Black Beauty, produced by Rooney, continued the post-L&S journey via the group’s own take of funky and melodic soul, approaching the style of the Staples Singers with plenty of emotive harmonies.\n\nExodus – Persona Non Grata [Reissue/2021] 2xLP (Nuclear Blast)\n\nNew clear gold, black, turquoise splatter colorway. For decades, Exodus has impressed us with the ability to attract opposing factions to their music because of its intensity and versatility. Exodus don’t fall into the usual recording slump that most bands get stuck in. Gathering at Tom Hunting’s house up in the mountains, they avoided the need to book studio time or adhere to a certain schedule.

It paid off. On their much-anticipated sophomore album, ambition is key. The name of the album itself The Iliad And The Odyssey And The Goalie’s Anxiety At The Penalty Kick spans a glorious 71 characters and is bound to swallow the screen of whatever device that attempts to display the text.

Includes “Los Chicos Tristes (El Michels Affair Remix),” introducing vocals from Jensine Benitez.\n\nHochzeitskapelle – We Dance LP (Alien Transistor)\n\nEnid Valu normally relies on lenses and light to express herself. Known to create stunning visuals, to capture sonic worlds with her preferred instrument (the camera), the US-born, Munich-based photographer and video artist has been working with various bands, shooting concerts, creating music videos, visualizing what she hears.

Legendary Swiss punk band from the late ‘70s. “You can’t dispute Liliput’s status as pioneers of feminist art-punk. Along with fellow travelers like the Slits and the Raincoats, this (mostly) female Swiss group took advantage of punk’s anything-goes attitude and created jittery, spirited pop that was both in step with the times and completely singular. The early material is a riot of exuberant energy, taking stylistic cues from peers like Gang of Four and Wire– propulsive bass, skittering pop rhythms, slashing guitars– and adding distinctive overlapping vocal patterns, which are sung, shrieked, and hiccupped in three languages and made- up dadaistic slang. More than 20 years on, it still sounds fresh.” – Lisa Gidley\n\nKorpses Katatonik – Subklinikal Leukotomy Aphrenia Spasmophilik Lyssophobo Asphyxia [Reissue/1983] LP (Infinite Fog)\n\nKorpses Katatonik was a musical solo project of Zoe DeWitt during the years 1982 and 1983. Unlike DeWitt’s later project Zero Kama, the work of Korpses Katatonik remains entirely within the realm of electronic music and shows an uncompromising experimental style comparable to that of other industrial bands like Throbbing Gristle, SPK, or Cabaret Voltaire. Like many other exponents of industrial culture Korpses Katatonik was inspired by dark psychiatry, pathological abnormalism, necrophilia, and other types of paraphilic aberration. These served as a metaphor for the dark side of a dehumanized society that seeks to maintain control by the suppression of anything that could be regarded as dark, sinister, deviant, or unpleasant from the viewpoint of popular mass culture.\n\nK-OS – Atlantis+ 2xLP (Astralwerks)\n\nCanadian rap/hip hop artist K-OS reissues Atlantis: Hymns For Disco on vinyl.

Originally released during the summer of 1973 by the obscure Gump label. Powered by a C-3 organ, Ludwig kit and 50-watt Marshall head with a home-built cabinet, this skilled 3-piece (not a quartet) absolutely soars and blast away heavenly. The delicate use of the studio echo-chamber lends a magical, gossamer reverb to the whole sound.\n\nLaufey – Typical Of Me LP (Laufey LLC)\n\n2021 EP from the singer/songwriter.

As with her debut album Cry Baby, K-12‘s music is a vibrant and singular melting pot of low-key hip-hop, soulful pop and indie-leaning electro. K-12‘s universe is an expansion of the one introduced in Cry Baby. Using lyrics rich with metaphor, songs address the struggle to find a place to belong -including within friendships, the physical world and romantically – even when fitting into society feels like an uphill battle.\n\nMatmos – Return To Archive LP (Smithsonian Folkways)\n\nReturn To Archive, Matmos’ 14th album, is constructed entirely from the “non-musical” recordings released by Folkways Records in the mid-20th century. It contains sounds sourced from dozens of LPs, from Sounds Of North American Frogs to Speech After The Removal Of The Larynx, Sounds Of Insects to Voices Of Satellites, Sounds Of Medicine to Sounds Of The Junk Yard. Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt were given unprecedented access to the label’s fabled archive at the Smithsonian Institution and encouraged to repurpose and rework the source material however they liked. The resulting album illuminates the radical, inquisitive, and poetic aspects of the original recordings, extracting the latent moments of creative revelation on records intended primarily for the backroom shelves of universities and libraries. Some tracks cycle through source material at a rate of dozens of samples per minute, while others sit with specific recordings for their duration.\n\nDave Matthews – Some Devil [Reissue/2003] 2xLP (Sony Legacy)\n\nSome Devil, Dave Matthews’ seminal solo studio album is now on vinyl for the first time.

First issued in 1961 on Columbia’s early music venture Colpix, Forbidden Fruit is widely acknowledged as the best of Nina Simone’s early releases. Producer Cal Lampley chose to cast her in varied settings, blending a rendition of Oscar Brown’s “Rags And Old Iron” with a unique take of Bessie Smith’s “Gin House Blues”, contrasting with Billie Holiday’s “No Good Man” and “I’ll Look Around”, which Simone shifts to her own image.

Soul Glo is a post-hardcore band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. If you gave Soul Glo a snapshot of what was in store for them in 2020 at the end of their first practice in 2014, you might put the space time continuum in flux. If you were to tell vocalist Pierce Jordan and guitarist Ruben Polo that everything that they had spent their first month as a band joking about, playing shows with artists from punk vets Paint It Black to Kurt Cobain’s favorites Flipper; from Memphis underground legend Tommy Wright III to platinum producer Pi’erre Bourne, were to actually happen, they might ask you if your hands were as fast as your jokes were. Despite the constant barrage of setbacks, from member changes to financial strife, to run-ins with the law, Soul Glo has both repeatedly defied the kinds of odds that would fold lesser bands, not to mention their own standards for what they believed they could endure. Simultaneously, stopping or slowing down has never exactly been on the table for them, either.\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers – Perennial Favorites [Reissue/1998] LP (Mammoth)\n\nSwing revival band Squirrel Nut Zippers released their third studio album, Perennial Favorites, in 1998.

Years after Herman Poole “LeSony’r Ra” Blount “left the planet” he’s still trying to reach us, to wake us up and to change our destiny. Sun Ra and the Arkestra weren’t a traditional studio band, and every star in the vast galaxy of their discography reflects this.\n\nThee Headcoats – I Am The Object Of Your Desire [Reissue/2000] LP (Damaged Goods)\n\nOriginally released by Friends Of The Buff Medway Fanciers Association in 2000, the final studio release by Thee Headcoats (until last year’s Irregularis: The Great Hiatus) gets a long-awaited vinyl reissue.

Formed from the ashes of Exhibit A in the Spring of 1981 the band disappeared leaving no trace shortly after 1983. During their brief existence they released a series of stickers, a monthly newsletter, two cassette tapes and their incomparable Straight Out Of The Fridge 10”.\n\nVarious Artists – ALFA/YEN Records 1980-1987: Techno Pop LP (Great Tracks)\n\nRecording technology was completely revolutionized in the ‘80s by the multitrack recorder, with the popularity of 24-channel SSL consoles sweeping the world. Japanese pop music created during this wave of digital improvement is now recognized worldwide as “City Pop.” Techno pop was another offshoot born of the same revolution. Precise, computer-controlled beats produced by groups like Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) introduced a different type of sound to the masses. By now, these works have been brought into the international limelight and continue to be a major influence on today’s music. At the center of Tokyo’s Techno pop scene was ALFA/YEN Records. The label left behind an impressive body of work, but much of it wasn’t made widely available… until now.\n\nVarious Artists – Industrial Strength Bluegrass [Reissue/2021] 2xLP (Smithsonian Folkways)\n\nDuring the middle decades of the 20th century, the factories of southwestern Ohio drew hundreds of thousands of migrants from Appalachia, including innumerable musicians.

Previously only available as a Record Store Day exclusive, Unclouded Sky returns on vinyl to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of its initial release.\n\nCassette:\n\nAgriculture – Living Is Easy / The Circle Chant 12”/Cassette (The Flenser)\n\nThe latest EP from ecstatic black metal band."
