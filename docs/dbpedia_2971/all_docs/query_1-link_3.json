        "text": "1. “Here We Come”\n\nHeltah Skeltah, Starang Wondah, Buckshot, and Steele\n\nProduced by 9th Wonder\n\nOver a NICELY used sample courtesy of The Dramatics’ Round and Round,” this was a DOPE opener, even with the title being a throwback to the intro from Heltah Skeltah’s first album, “Nocturnal.” The BCC was back in full force, no doubt. 5 out of 5\n\n2. “Let’s Go”\n\nBuckshot, Heltah Skeltah, Steele, and Starang Wondah\n\nProduced by ILLMIND\n\nWhat we get here is that vintage BCC sound, dope lyrics of over an equally dope ILLMIND production. 5 out of 5\n\n3. “Yeah”\n\nSmif-n-Wessun, Buckshot, Rock, and Louieville Sluggah\n\nProduced by Marco Polo\n\nThe dopeness continues with this joint, featuring its “call & response” hook. Tek, Steele, Rock, and Louieville drop very good verses, but man, Buckshot continued to be nice on the mic and had been on a lyrical resurgence since Black Moon’s “War Zone” album. I also liked the little throwback to “Headz Ain’t Redee” towards the end. 4 out of 5\n\n4. “Hate All You Want”\n\nHeltah Skeltah, Buckshot, and Smif-N-Wessun\n\nProduced by Marco Polo\n\nMan, how much dopeness can fit into this album so far? This apply titled joint simply does bang and you can tell the guys were just in a zone, lyrically, and completely feeling this production. 5 out of 5\n\n5. “Don’t You Cross The Line”\n\nHeltah Skeltah, Top Dog, Buckshot, Louieville Sluggah, and Smif-n-Wessun\n\nProduced by SIC Beats\n\nAll involved come with some aggressive heat on this appropriately titled song. 4 out of 5\n\n6. “1–2–3”\n\nBuckshot, Starang Wondah, Tek, and Sean Price\n\nAdditional Vocals by Komika\n\nProduced by Pete Rock\n\nOver the signature sound of Mr. Pete Rock, Buckshot, Starang, Tek, and Sean P bring the usual dope verses to this one, complete with a throwback, reggae styled vibe on the hook; think of “U Da Man” from the first Black Moon album. 4 out of 5\n\n7. “Take A Look (In The Mirror)”\n\nBuckshot, Smif-n-Wessun, Sean Price, and Louieville Sluggah\n\nProduced by 9th Wonder\n\n9th Wonder was sick with the samples here, courtesy of Martha and the Vandellas’ “Take a Look.” And of course it didn’t take long for the crew to come with the heat, lyrical heat that is. 4 out of 5\n\n8. “He Gave His Life”\n\nSmif-n-Wessun, Louieville Sluggah, and Buckshot\n\nProduced by Marco Polo\n\nThe men give a heartfelt dedication to those who are no longer with us. Buckshot closes the song by advising the young ones to maintain instead of living life in the fast lane. VERY good song. 4 out of 5\n\n9. “Trading Places”\n\nHeltah Skeltah and Smif-n-Wessun\n\nProduced by Ken Ring and Rune Rotter\n\nTek, Steele, Rock, and Sean Price scored MAJOR points for creativity on this fast paced song. Not only do they ride the beat in such a tight fashion, they also quote each other lyrics from past classics as well as lines from other members of the crew, namely “Shit Iz Real,” “Intro (Here We Come),” “Wontime,” “Black Smif-n-Wessun,” “Leflaur Leflah Eshkoshka,” “Stand Strong,” and”Headz Are Redee Pt. 2.” VERY good song. 5 out of 5\n\n10. “….. But Tha Game Iz Still Tha Same”\n\nBuckshot, Heltah Skeltah, and Steele\n\nProduced by Da Beatminerz\n\nThe opening words from Louis Farrakhan tells the story of this dope song:\n\n“The names and faces have changed, but the game is still the same.”\n\nYes indeed. I also gotta acknowledge Steele for his TIGHT verse in which he uses video gaming systems as a running metaphor throughout 8 bars. 4 out of 5\n\n11. “So Focused”\n\nBuckshot, Smif-n-Wessun, and Starang Wondah\n\nProduced by 9th Wonder\n\nWell, I guess it didn’t take too long for the crew to come with a song for the ladies. It’s all good though, because while this one is strictly for the ladies, but the fellas would appreciate it too. 4 out of 5\n\n12. “Everybody Knows Now”\n\nBuckshot, Louieville Sluggah, Rock, and Smif-n-Wessun\n\nProduced by Coptic\n\n“They never big you up when you goin down.” I hear that. Another good song here, nothing more or less. I liked Buckshot coming with Snoop Dogg’s “Stranded on Death Row” flow for his verse, and Rock completely goes in with his closing bars. 4 out of 5\n\n13. “World Wide”\n\nSteele, Heltah Skeltah, Louieville Sluggah, and Buckshot\n\nProduced by The Large Professor\n\nThe crews shows mad love to cities all over for their support over the years. Speaking of mad love, they get an extra bit of that for continuing to do their thing as we speak AND for shouting out Virginia! 4 out of 5\n\n14. “Soul Jah”\n\nProduced by Mr. Attic\n\nIt was only fitting that the entire crew came together for this GREAT closer. They’re souljahs till the end! 5 out of 5\n\n“When we ride out, we ride together, let’s get busy!”\n\nWow, WHERE did this come from?! I know I own this CD, but holy shit I almost forgot how DOPE this joint is. Quite frankly, THIS is the album that 1997’s disappointing “For Da People” SHOULD’VE been, no doubt about that. Lyrically, these men showed that they had not lost one step and they were SO inspired and motivated on this entire album it’s not even funny. Speaking of motivation and inspiration, I feel a lot of that came from the awesome production, which complemented the crew SO well. It’s nothing but dopeness up and down the lineup here, and I really want to go the full monty and award this 5 stars, but in the interest of fairness and being objective, I’m going with a solid 4.5 star rating. I know that the follow up, 2007’s “Casualties Of War,” had leftover songs that didn’t make this album, which was NOT the last BCC album, for the record, but man we GOTTA get another BCC project at some point. (As of December 22, 2013, the crew dropped a dope single in the form of “Wotcha Call Strength,” but there’s no word on if/when we will get another BCC album, especially since Sean Price is no longer with us.)\n\nOverall, of all the BCC albums, “The Last Stand” is simply the best one of them all. STRONG recommendation to check this out, and mad love, props, and respect to Buckshot, Tek, Steele, Rock, Sean Price (aka Ruck), Top Dog, Starang Wondah, Louieville Sluggah and all the producers involved for this album!"
