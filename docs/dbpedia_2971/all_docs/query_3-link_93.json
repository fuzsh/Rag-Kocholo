        "text": "The dynamic duo of Tek and Steele known as, Smif N’ Wessun, are survivors of the game of hip-hop. Their street slick rhymes, personal chemistry, and ability to trade the mic smoother than a Hennie and Coke, are a testament to team work.\n\nWith a fast break into success, legal trouble that forced a brief name change, and moving into the drive’s seat, from emcees to entrepreneurs, Tek and Steele have stood tall in the face of adversity as an impenetrable force.\n\nNatives of Brooklyn, New York, Tek and Steele made their first appearance to the world of hip-hop on Black Moon’s 1993 debut, Enta Da’ Stage. The tracks, “Black Smif N’ Wessun” and “U Da Man,” showcased their fierce and unrestricted lyrics.\n\n“Black Smif N’ Wessun” had a hard drum beat and deeply submerged bass-line, as the crew ferociously chanted the chorus. Steele’s opening lines contained an unapologetic/ in your face energy that few have been able to replicate:\n\nHere we go, break of day, with a mad live session/\n\nDown in Bucktown it’s Black Moon, and Smif-N-Wessun/\n\nPick up the pace cuz we’re right behind ya black/\n\nThe punk got X-amount of shots, take one to your back/\n\nBOO-YAA-KAA!!!\n\nWhile Tek had an ability to flip multiple words throughout a verse:\n\nAhh shit, a personality split/\n\nAnd I’m bout to flip with my nigga pull the trigger let the Glock spit/\n\nA little bad-ass shorty with no remorse/\n\nI kill forties and quarts remains on stage so who the boss?/\n\nAnother boom blew up the scene/\n\nthroughout the planet, get green, now I got sticky mean with my tag team/\n\n“U Da Man,” featured Big DruHa, Havoc, and Smif-N-Wessun. With the collective of emcees’ hardcore rhymes, it was an ideal closing track o the innovative album.\n\nIn 1994, Buckshot and DruHa founded Duck Down Management, signing Smif N’ Wessun as their first act to Nervous Records. Not only did their debut, Dah Shinin, sell over 300,000 copies, but it also coined the name of the fourth great wave of hip-hop music.\n\nTek N’ Steel stormed the masses with hardcore rhymes and a flawless ability to trade the mic without hesitation.\n\n“Dah Shinin’, was an era when hip-hop was just coming back from the West to the hardcore streets of New York, and you were proud to be a fan of it…that was kind of a renaissance time,” explained Steele.\n\nProduced by Evil Dee and Mr. Walt, the album was layered with heavy bass lines, razor sharp scratching and a dungeon sound that basted through any roof. While tracks like, “Timbz N’ Hood Check,” told of the underbelly of street life, “Won Time,” discussed the results of snitching; “Cession At Da Doghillee,” previewed the soon to be Boot Camp Clik; and the jazz influenced Brooklyn anthem, ”Buck Town,” became a Duck Down trademark.\n\nAlthough Smif N’ Wessun never officially released an album on Rawkus Records, the duo came into their own, freelancing on various collaborative projects including clothing ads, defining themselves as true survivors of the game. Teaming up with Gangstarr Foundation member, Afu-ra, on the, D&D Sound Clash (2000), which featured beat composition by producers extraordinaire, Evil Dee and DJ Premier; it ranked #1 on the Hip-hop/R&B Charts.\n\nIn the same year, Tek and Steele rejoined the Boot Camp Clik on their second album, The Chosen Few. The track, “Bucktown USA,” would become a springboard for their future entrepreneurial opportunities.\n\nAdditional freelance credits include Talib Kweli (“Gunn Music”), Tony Touch (“Spanish Harlem 2”), and a cameo with Buckshot in the “I Miss You,” tribute video for Aaliyah. She was a close friend.\n\nIn 2003, Tek and Steele moved into the driver’s seat founding, Bucktown USA Entertainment. They released their first independent full-length compilation titled, Glory. The debut LP featured artists from New York, Maryland, and Georgia.\n\nThrough the Bucktown USA label, Smif N’ Wessun have released several solo projects including; Tek’s, Amerikka’s Nightmare (2004), I Got This (2006); Steele’s “First Famlee (2004)”; Smif N’ Wessun, X-Files (2006)”; as well as serving as an additional branch for Duck Down Enterprize affiliated projects.\n\n2005 was a year of due justice for Smif N’ Wessun. After years of legal debate, they were finally awarded the reinstatement of the Smif N’ Wessun name. With a new found confidence they release, Reloaded. The album was one of three relapses during Duck Down’s Triple Threat Summer promotion. Tek and Steele came in full force. Tracks “Gunn Rap,” and “My Timbz Do Work,” brought back the classic Smif N’ Wessun swagger. With cover art by Marc Ecko, and guest appearances by Talib Kweli (“Crystal Stair”), Tony Touch (“U Undastand Me?”), and Dead Prez (“Warriorz Heart: Gangbang”), the album resurrected a sound that was thought to have been lost.\n\nThe third Boot Camp Clik release, The Last Stand, featured the entire Timberland boot clad battalion (Buckshot, Smif N Wessun, Sean Price and Rock of Heltah Skeltah, O.G.C.’s Starang Wondah, Top Dog, and Louieville Sluggah), production by Pete Rock, Da Beatminerz, Large Professor, 9th Wonder, Macro Pollo, Ill Mind, Coptic, Sic Beats, and Ken BB. While “Here We Go,” displayed memorable BCC rhyming ciphers, “1-2-3,” had a macho “knock to the skull” feel.\n\nThe duo of Tek and Steele, have shown themselves to be more than emcees. Hitting hip-hop music with a raw and un-duplicable style, business sense and survival skills, the name, Smif N’ Wessun, shines above the rest.\n\nBuckshot\n\nBuckshot (born Kenyatta Blake on November 19, 1974 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American rapper, known for being the leader of the hip-hop supergroup Boot Camp Clik, and the group Black Moon.[2][3] He has released one solo album, three with producer 9th Wonder, one with KRS-ONE, four albums with Black Moon and four albums with the Boot Camp Clik.\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, Kenyatta Blake a.k.a. Buckshot Shorty began rapping in neighborhood rhyming ciphers. In high school, he befriended 5 ft, DJ Evil Dee and Mr. Walt, who would evolve into the super production team Da Beatminerz.\n\nIn 1992, Buckshot, 5 ft and DJ Evil Dee, formed Black Moon. The trio released the single, “Who Got Da Props?” in 1993, which reached #86 on the Billboard Top 100 charts, landing them a recording deal with Nervous Records. Later that year, Black Moon released their first full-length album, Enta Da Stage to positive critical acclaim.\n\nThe album featured appearances by Havoc of Mobb Deep, as well as future Boot Camp Clik members, Tek and Steele of Smif N Wessun.\n\nIn 1994, with Dru-Ha, the two left Nervous Records and formed Duck Down Management. That same year, Buckshot signed and oversaw the creation of Smif N’ Wessun’s debut album Dah Shinin’, as well as adding Heltah Skeltah (Ruck a.k.a. Sean Price, and Rock) and O.G.C.: Originoo Gunn Clappa (Starang Wondah, Top Dog, and Louieville Sluggah) to Duck Down’s roster. During the summer, Buckshot took part in the collaboration the Crooklyn Dodgers (Buckshot, Masta Ace and Special Ed), releasing a single by the same name, on the soundtrack of Spike Lee’s, Crooklyn.\n\nOfficially titled Duck Down Entaprizez in 1996, Buckshot, Dru-Ha and Smif N Wessun began work with 2Pac on the unreleased studio album One Nation. During this time Buckshot was dubbed, “The BDI Thug” by 2Pac.\n\nMarch 1997 marked a milestone in Duck Down history. The collective of: Buckshot, Smif N Wessun (Tek and Steele), Heltah Skeltah (Ruck a.k.a. Sean Price and Rock), and O.G.C.: Originoo Gunn Clappaz (Starang Wondah, Top Dog and Louieville Sluggah) formed the super group, The Boot Camp Clik, who released their debut album, For the People. A remix of “Night Riders” was recorded featuring Aaliyah, but the single was never released, due to conflicts between record labels.\n\nIn 1999 Black Moon released their second album, War Zone. It was their first full-length album in more than 5 years. Featuring guest appearances from Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes, M.O.P., Heather B. and produced by Da Beatminerz, the album sold over 200,000 units and was met with strong reviews. Buckshot’s solo album, The BDI Thug, was released later that year but to mediocre reviews.\n\nIn July 2002, Duck Down ended its two-year search for a new distribution deal, inking a three-year contract with Koch Distribution. Boot Camp Clik released their second full-length album, The Chosen Few. The album sold over 60,000 copies, making it one of Duck Down’s most successful releases. In 2004, Black Moon returned with Total Eclipse. The album peaked at #47 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Charts and ranked #23 for independent albums.\n\nBuckshot and 9th Wonder (Little Brother and Justus League) collaborated to release Chemistry in summer 2005 to positive reviews. Duck Down also released Smif N Wessun’s Reloaded and Sean Price’s Monkey Barz.\n\nBoot Camp Clik returned in summer 2006 with The Last Stand. With an all-star cast of producers (Pete Rock, Da Beatminerz, 9th Wonder, Large Professor, Marco Polo, Ill Mind, Coptic, Sic Beats and Ken BB), it was a critical success and marked the return of the entire Boot Camp Clik for the first time in several years. In addition, Black Moon released, Alter The Chemistry. Laced with 1970s influenced rhythms and samples it takes a new approach to Buckshot and 9th Wonder’s, Chemistry.\n\nIn September 2008, Buckshot was hospitalized after suffering a series of seizures. His partner, Dru-Ha, said he had just returned from a three-week tour through Europe prior to the episodes. After a short hospitalization, he was released and returned to performing and recording.\n\nBuckshot and KRS-ONE also released an album together, called Survival Skills, on September 15, 2009 on Duck Down Records. Its first single “Robot”, produced by Havoc, was released on iTunes on May 5, 2009."
