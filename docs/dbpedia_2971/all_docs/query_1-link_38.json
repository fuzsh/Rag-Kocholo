He sets his narratives in country and rockabilly tunes that strive for classic American simplicity, though his words detail an uncertain moral landscape. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Jon Pareles)\n\n★ AMADOU AND MARIAM (Sunday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album “Dimanche à Bamako,” last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock. With Daby Touré and Birdy Nam Nam. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Ben Sisario)\n\n‘AMERICAN IDOLS LIVE’ (Tonight through Sunday) The 10 finalists from Season 5 of “American Idol” logged about a million yeah-yeah’s and baby-baby’s on television, and here they come on tour with who knows how many more: Taylor Hicks (the winner), Katharine McPhee (the runner-up), Ace Young, Bucky Covington, Chris Daughtry, Elliott Yamin, Kellie Pickler, Lisa Tucker, Mandisa and Paris Bennett. Tonight at 7, Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; tomorrow and Sunday nights at 7, Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000; $36.50 to $70.50. (Sisario)\n\nBON JOVI (Tuesday and Wednesday) Bon Jovi, the band that titled its 1998 album “New Jersey,” is back in its home state. Jon Bon Jovi’s band conquered the airwaves in the 1980’s and 90’s by sticking together everything catchy about 70’s rock: Bruce Springsteen’s earnestness, Led Zeppelin’s crunch, Boston’s harmonies, and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. A photogenic lead singer doesn’t hurt, either. With Nickelback. At 5 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $37.50 to $125. (Pareles)\n\nBRAVE COMBO (Wednesday) Brave Combo, on a lifelong mission to prove the malleability of polka, plays an all-request show at Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center’s outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing. At 7:30 p.m., with a dance lesson at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 875-5460; $15. (Sisario)\n\nBRAVO SILVA, RAISING THE FAWN (Wednesday) Drawing on the spiky and melodic sound of the early Police and U2, the New York band Bravo Silva sings deadpan odes to the city of strangers, though not so deadpan as to exclude playing soaring, ecstatic choruses and having some fun with kitschy keyboards. This month the band has a Wednesday-night residency at Pianos. Also on the bill this week is Raising the Fawn, a group connected to the great Toronto indie-prog collective Broken Social Scene. At 6:30 p.m., 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733; $8. (Sisario)\n\nKELLY CLARKSON (Tomorrow) The first “American Idol” champion, who won two Grammys and had the third-best-selling album of 2005, Ms. Clarkson is the best proof yet that reality television might not be a bad idea. With Rooney. At 8 p.m., New England Dodge Music Center, Hartford, (860) 548-7370; $25 to $75. (Sisario)\n\n★ DIPLO, CSS, BONDE DO ROLE (Wednesday and Thursday) Diplo, born Wesley Pentz — his stage name is taken from diplodocus, a dinosaur — is the influential and eclectic D.J. who has worked with the Sri Lankan-British rapper M.I.A., and is also half of Hollertronix, a virtuoso mixtape team from Philadelphia. He has been borrowing from Brazilian baile funk for years, and the first release on his new record label, Mad Descent, is by the Brazilian group Bonde do Role. Diplo is touring with that band and another Brazilian group, CSS, whose come-ons are shouted in robotic, broken English (“Kiss-kiss-kiss will make this earth quake”) over bare but exuberant art-funk. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; Thursday at 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sisario)\n\nJOHN HIATT, NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS (Tuesday) Mr. Hiatt has rhymed amoeba with Queen of Sheba; his songs get to the heart of human frailty, loyalty and love, even if they take a sidelong route. He performs with a deep-diving baritone, a twang-happy band and enough strange facial expressions to rival Jim Carrey. The North Mississippi Allstars play an asymmetrical, cantankerous blues from the hill country near where the members grew up, then turn it into jam-band music. At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $30. (Pareles)\n\nI LOVE YOU BUT I’VE CHOSEN DARKNESS (Wednesday) All is cold, echoey gloom in the music of this five-piece band from Austin, Tex., which borrows its spacious sound from Joy Division and its faint vocals from the shoe-gazer British bands of the late 1980’s like My Bloody Valentine. With the Big Sleep and Asobi Seksu, a Brooklyn group whose new album, “Citrus” (Friendly Fire), shows a fine command of the shoe-gazer sound. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario)\n\n★ MADONNA (Tuesday and Wednesday) Part 10 (or so), in which our heroine strikes such poses as Jesus on the cross, James Brown in his cape and John Travolta in his white disco suit, all while performing dance-floor hits in new remixes and reconfigurations. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $354.50 tickets remaining. (Sisario)\n\nMISSION OF BURMA (Tonight) In the early 1980’s this innovative and widely influential Boston band brought sharp, brainy guitar minimalism to American postpunk, and since reuniting in 2002 after almost 20 years, it still plays with passion and smarts. With Major Stars. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sisario)\n\nMOBB DEEP, RAEKWON (Wednesday) Mobb Deep, a rap duo from Queens long admired by connoisseurs for its grim and vivid rhymes, was recently taken under 50 Cent’s wing, with one result that you might expect: its new album, “Blood Money” (G Unit/Interscope), had its debut in the Top 10. Also on the bill is Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan, and a long lineup of opening acts including the Boot Camp Clik. At 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $35. (Sisario)\n\nMUNICIPAL WASTE (Tonight) Seemingly everything about the mid-1980’s thrash metal of groups like D.R.I. and Anthrax is lovingly and skillfully recreated by this band from Richmond, Va., from the high-octane riffs and stomping mosh-pit rhythms all the way to the cartoonish, apocalyptic album-cover art. With Annihilation Time, Splitting Headache, Clockcleaner and Dustheads. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $9. (Sisario)\n\nNORTEC COLLECTIVE (Tomorrow) A loose confederation of musicians and visual artists, the Nortec Collective is devoted to the cutting, rearranging and pasting of norteño, the vibrant border style of oompah brass and accordion known on this side of the border as Tex-Mex. With Grupo Soñador. At 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)\n\nOZOMATLI (Tonight) Ozomatli makes what might be called political party music. It’s a Los Angeles band that is determined to annex every pan-American party groove from funk to samba to Mexican cumbia in its consciousness-raising songs. With Outernational. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)\n\nRBD (Tomorrow) This teen-pop sextet began on a spinoff of a Mexican soap opera and is now aiming for the American market with an English-language album. Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $49.50 to $115. (Sisario)\n\nJOSH ROUSE (Thursday) Mr. Rouse wraps folk-rock melodies around wistful thoughts about regrets, near-misses and forlorn hopes. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Pareles)\n\n★ SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) One of the most tastefully programmed indie-rock festivals in the country, The Village Voice’s annual afternoon of noise and sea mist takes place on two stages beside the Coney Island boardwalk, surrounded by hot-dog vendors and the screams of roller-coaster riders. The lineup this year includes the neo-disco Scissor Sisters; the exuberantly sarcastic Art Brut; the Stills, a Canadian band with a moody, shimmering take on the sound of New York bands like Interpol and the Strokes; Stars, a witty and eloquent indie-cabaret band from Toronto; She Wants Revenge and Dirty on Purpose, two more groups with gloom fetishes; Tapes ’n Tapes, from Minneapolis, whose dry rhapsodies recall Pavement and the early Pixies; the bluesy and rough-hewn Deadboy and the Elephantmen; and Man Man, the Rogers Sisters, Priestess, Celebration, Serena Maneesh and the Cribs. From noon to 9 p.m., Surf Avenue, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (212) 475-4022; free. (Sisario)\n\nSOUNDS OF THE UNDERGROUND TOUR (Tomorrow) An afternoon of fast, pummeling heavy metal characterized by lots of death-and-gore-obsessed lyrics, with As I Lay Dying, Cannibal Corpse, In Flames, Trivium, Terror, Black Dahlia Murder and Through the Eyes of the Dead. And since the vaudevillian horror-metal band Gwar is on the bill, there will also be a fair complement of monsters with ripped limbs spurting fake, multicolored blood. At noon, Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500; $32 in advance, $36 at the door. (Sisario)\n\nMATTHEW SWEET AND SUSANNA HOFFS (Monday) Mr. Sweet, the power-pop songwriter with a sensitive side (“Girlfriend”), and Ms. Hoffs, the lead singer of the Bangles, indulge their love of jangly 1960’s pop, playing songs from “Under the Covers, Vol. 1” (Shout Factory), their recent joint album of loving versions of songs by the Beatles, Love, the Zombies, the Mamas and the Papas, and others. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario)"
