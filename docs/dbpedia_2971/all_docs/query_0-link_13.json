In addition, the song “Cosmic Slop” shares its name with a 1973 Funkadelic album.\n\nIn 2010, Redman told Vibe Magazine that he never performed any songs from Dare Iz A Darkside in recent years - primarily due to the album being made during one of the dark times in his life. The positive reaction to the album stunned Redman, who said “I was doing a lot of drugs on Dare Iz A Darkside. I have chicks that come up to me and say, ‘Yo, Dare Iz A Darkside is my favorite fuckin’ album, ever.’ I swear, I have not played Dare Iz A Darkside damn near since I did it. Seriously!

The album is notable for its snappy, crispy drums and extensive use of vocal scratches, usually from songs by Biz Markie. Although missing a centerpiece on the scale of “They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)”, the album contains some of the duo’s best known work, in the form of tracks such as the upbeat “In The House”, and the catchy “Sun Won’t Come Out”, which features a lush vocal sample from the song of the same name by Harvey Scales.\n\nContinuing a theme initiated by Mecca and the Soul Brother, brief instrumental interludes are placed at the beginning and end of songs. With the exception of just a few tracks, this feature is recurrent throughout the album. In addition, The Main Ingredient saw Rock fleshing out and defining his trademark production style, which is now recognized for often containing smooth basslines, swirling horns, filtered samples, and spacious grooves. The production on this album proved to be influential upon a legion of latter day producers.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- The track ‘Take You There’ appears on our Classic Material 1994 Mixtape.\n\n- The track ‘Get On The Mic’ appears on our 1994 Rap Megamix.\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Spotify / Youtube\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nJungle Brothers ‘Done by the Forces of Nature’ 30th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 7th November 1989\n\nLabel: Warner Bros.\n\nProducers: Jungle Brothers, Kool DJ red Alert\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“Done by the Forces of Nature is the second studio album by American hip hop group Jungle Brothers, released on November 7, 1989 by Warner Bros.

Kweli raps the second and final verse of “Know That”, while Busta goes back and forth with Mos on “Do It Now”. Q-Tip helps sing the chorus on “Mr. Nigga” but doesn’t deliver a verse. The lyrics Q-Tip recites are similar to his previously released lyrics on A Tribe Called Quest’s “Sucka Nigga”.

The album has an uncharacteristically gritty sound, featuring some of the darkest tracks that Ice-T ever released. The album was released after Ice-T was encountering censorship problems on tour. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck? the rapper states that “People had already told me what I could not say onstage in Columbus, Georgia. You couldn’t say anything they called a ‘swear’ word. You couldn’t touch yourself. They were using the same tactics they used on everyone from Elvis and Jim Morrison to 2 Live Crew”. The album’s cover, featuring a B-boy with a shotgun shoved in his mouth, and two pistols pressed against each side of his head, reflected Ice-T’s experiences with the concept of freedom of speech. “The concept of that picture is, ‘Go ahead and say what you want.

Its production was handled by DJ Premier, Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, L.E.S. and Nas himself. Styled as a hardcore hip hop album, Illmatic features multi-syllabic internal rhymes and inner-city narratives based on Nas’ experiences in Queensbridge, New York.\n\nThe album debuted at number 12 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 94,000 copies in its first week. However, its initial sales fell below expectations and its five singles failed to achieve significant chart success. Despite the album’s low initial sales, Illmatic received rave reviews from most music critics, who praised its production and Nas’ lyricism. On January 17, 1996, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and on December 11, 2001 it earned a platinum certification after shipping 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album has sold 2 million copies in the United States as of February 6, 2019.\n\nSince its initial reception, Illmatic has been recognized by writers and music critics as a landmark album in East Coast hip hop. Its influence on subsequent hip hop artists has been attributed to the album’s production and Nas’ lyricism. It also contributed to the revival of the New York City rap scene, introducing a number of stylistic trends to the region. The album is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time, appearing on numerous best album lists by critics and publications.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- Listen to Chris Read’s 25th Anniversary mixtape.\n\n- The singles ‘One Love’ and ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ appears on our Classic Material 1994 Mixtape.\n\n- The track ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell (Large Professor Remix) appears on our 1994 Rap Megamix.\n\n- The album comes in at #1 on Ego Trip’s Top 25 Rap Albums of 1994.\n\n- The singles ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ comes in at #11 on Ego Trip’s Top 40 Rap Singles of 1994.\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Spotify / Youtube\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nKool G Rap & DJ Polo - ‘Road to the Riches’ 30th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 14th March 1989\n\nLabel: Cold Chillin’\n\nProducers: Marley Marl\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“Road to the Riches is the debut album by hip hop duo Kool G Rap & DJ Polo, which was released in 1989 on then-prominent hip hop label Cold Chillin’ Records. The title track “Road to the Riches,” received strong rotation on the TV show Yo! MTV Raps, and was later featured on the old-school hip hop radio station Playback FM from the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Most of the songs, however, are not crime-related. Other popular songs included “It’s a Demo” and “Poison.” In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source’s 100 Best Rap Albums\n\nKool G Rap and DJ Polo were members of the legendary Juice Crew, led by producer Marley Marl. The duo first premiered on Mr. Magic’s Rap Attack radio show on 107.5 in 1986 with its first single “It’s A Demo.” They spent the next few years releasing singles, and eventually wrote and recorded Road to the Riches in 1988, but wasn’t released until early 1989. The album showcases G Rap’s signature multisyllabic rhyme style with lyric topics ranging from crime, materialism, braggadocio, to love. The production was entirely handled by fellow Juice Crew member Marley Marl, who provided a more hard-edged style of production than that of his previous work.\n\nRoad to the Riches is often cited as the beginning of the mafioso rap genre, laying the groundwork for future hip hop stars such as Scarface, Nas, Raekwon, Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., and AZ, among others, however the bulk of the album features battle rap lyrics similar to Big Daddy Kane or Rakim without the explicit mafioso or gangsta rap subjects of the title track. G Rap would begin expanding his vivid storytelling and organized crime themes on his next album, Wanted: Dead or Alive and especially on 1992’s Live and Let Die.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Youtube\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nGang Starr ‘Hard to Earn’ 25th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 8th March 1994\n\nLabel: Chrysalis / EMI\n\nProducers: DJ Premier / Guru\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“Hard to Earn is the fourth album from the hip hop duo Gang Starr.

Hot on the heels of his standout appearances on Dr. Dre’s 1992 solo debut The Chronic, Doggystyle rocketed Snoop to stardom. Following in the sonic footsteps of The Chronic, the album was one of a number from the era responsible for popularising the emerging G-Funk sound, with West Coast Funk, P-Funk and Boogie samples colliding with polished production values to great effect. The album ultimately would go on to achieve quadruple-platinum sales.\n\nIn celebration of the album’s 25th Anniversary, DJ Matman has crafted an exclusive mixtape of album tracks, alternate versions, interview snippets and of course original sample material, which we’re pleased to present in collaboration with Wax Poetics magazine.”\n\nListen on Mixcloud here.\n\nSnoop Dogg ‘Doggystyle’ 25th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 23rd November 1993\n\nLabel: Death Row / Interscope\n\nProducers: Dr. Dre\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“Doggystyle is the debut studio album by American rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. It was released on November 23, 1993, by Death Row Records and Interscope Records. The album was recorded and produced following Snoop’s appearances on Dr. Dre’s debut solo album The Chronic (1992), to which Snoop contributed significantly. The West Coast style in hip-hop that he developed from Dre’s first album continued on Doggystyle. Critics have praised Snoop Doggy Dogg for the lyrical “realism” that he delivers on the album and for his distinctive vocal flow. Despite some mixed criticism of the album initially upon its release, Doggystyle earned recognition from many music critics as one of the most significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the most important hip-hop albums ever released. Much like The Chronic, the distinctive sounds of Doggystyle helped introduce the hip-hop subgenre of g-funk to a mainstream audience, bringing forward West Coast hip hop as a dominant force in the early-1990s.\n\nDoggystyle debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 806,858 copies in its first week alone in the United States, which was the record for a debuting artist and the fastest-selling hip-hop album ever. Doggystyle was included on The Source magazine’s list of the 100 Best Rap Albums; as well as Rolling Stone magazine’s list of Essential Recordings of the ‘90s. About.com placed the album in No. 17 of the greatest hip hop/rap albums of all time. The album was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). By November 2015, the album had sold 7 million copies in the United States, and over 11 million copies worldwide.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- Listen to DJ Matman’s 25th Anniversary Mixtape.\n\n- The album comes in at #3 on Ego Trip’s Top 25 Rap Albums of 1993.\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Spotify / Youtube\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nDel ‘No Need For Alarm’ 25th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 23rd November 1993\n\nLabel: Elektra\n\nProducers: Snupe, Casual, Del, Domino, SD-50s, Jay-Biz, A-Plus\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“No Need for Alarm is the second solo studio album by American hip hop musician Del the Funky Homosapien. It was released by Elektra Records in 1993. It peaked at number 125 on the Billboard 200 chart. Nathan Rabin of AllMusic gave the album 3 stars out of 5, calling it “a challenging, unique, and uncompromising follow-up, one well worth picking up for anyone interested in either the evolution of West Coast hip-hop or just the evolution of one of its most talented, eccentric, and gifted artists.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Spotify / Youtube\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nWu-Tang Clan ‘Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)’ 25th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 9th November 1993\n\nLabel: Loud\n\nProducers: RZA, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Method Man\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, released on November 9, 1993 by Loud Records. Recording sessions took place during 1992 to 1993 at Firehouse Studio in New York City, and the album was produced by the group’s de facto leader RZA. Its title originates from the martial arts film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978).\n\nThe distinctive sound of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) created a blueprint for hardcore hip hop during the 1990s, and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence. Its sound also became greatly influential in modern hip hop production, while the group members’ explicit, humorous, and free-associative lyrics have served as a template for many subsequent hip hop records. Serving as a landmark release in the era of hip hop known as the East Coast Renaissance, its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast hip hop artists, including Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.\n\nDespite its raw, underground sound, the album had surprising chart success, peaking at #41 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 30,000 copies in the 1st week. By 1995, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over 2 million copies in the United States.

Recording sessions for the album occurred at Battery Studios, Platinum Island Studios and Scorcerer Sound in New York City. Its production was mainly handled by Q-Tip, with contributions from Skeff Anselm, Large Professor and the group’s DJ, Ali Shaheed Muhammad. A culmination of the group’s two previous albums, it features an eclectic, gritty sound based on jazz, funk, soul and R&B samples, in addition to socially conscious, positive-minded and humorous lyrics.\n\nMidnight Marauders debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The first two singles, “Award Tour” and “Electric Relaxation”, charted on the Billboard Hot 100, before the release of the final single, “Oh My God”. On January 14, 1994, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. It was certified platinum by the RIAA nearly a full year later, on January 11, 1995, with shipments of one million copies.\n\nThe album received mostly positive reviews, and in the following years, Midnight Marauders has acquired acclamation from within the hip-hop community for its production, chemistry and influence, with some regarding it as the group’s best work.

It was released in September 21, 1993 by Tommy Boy and was the group’s last record to be produced with Prince Paul. Buhloone is a phonetic spelling of the English noun “balloon”. This theme is laid out in the intro track, which starts with the sound of a balloon being inflated; then the hookline “it might blow up, but it won’t go pop” is repeated over and over, until the sound of a balloon popping replaces the final word “pop”. This lends itself to the interpretation that the group hope to expand their popularity with their third album without selling out. At the end of 1993, Buhloone Mindstate was voted the eighth best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. Robert Christgau, the poll’s creator and supervisor, ranked it fifth best on his own year-end list. In a contemporary review, Rolling Stone critic Paul Evans said the record was more focused than De La Soul’s previous albums and also more ambitious sonically: “Musically, Buhloone Mind State raises the stakes; it gets to something rap seldom achieves — a truly gorgeous groove.” In 2005, comedian Chris Rock named it the 10th greatest hip hop record of all time in a list published by Rolling Stone”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- The album comes in at #4 on Ego Trip’s Top 25 Rap Albums of 1993.\n\n- The single ‘Breakadawn’ comes in at #27 on Ego Trip’s Top 40 Rap Singles of 1993.\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Youtube\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nMarley Marl ‘In Control Volume 1’ 30th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 20th September 1988\n\nLabel: Cold Chillin / Warner Bros\n\nProducers: Marley Marl\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“In Control, Volume 1 is an album by hip hop producer Marley Marl of the Juice Crew, released September 20, 1988 on Cold Chillin’ Records.

The album is broken down track-by-track by Marley Marl in Brian Coleman’s book Check the Technique. The opulent cover stood in contrast to Marley Marl’s real living conditions: “I was still living in the projects. I was paying like $110 a month for my rent, free electricity.

It was produced by Marley Marl and established both as premier artists during hip hop’s golden age. Kane displayed his unique rapping technique while covering topics including love (“I’ll Take You There”), Afrocentricity (“Word to the Mother(Land)”) and his rapping prowess (“Set It Off”). Marley Marl and Big Daddy Kane display a sparse production style - creating beats with fast-paced drums and lightly utilized James Brown samples.\n\nFour singles were released in promotion of Kane’s first album: “Raw/Word to the Mother (Land),” “Ain’t No Half-Steppin’/Get Into It,” “I’ll Take You There/Wrath of Kane” and “Set It Off/Get Into It.” The most commercially successful of these singles were “Ain’t No Half-Steppin’”, which reached #53 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart, and “I’ll Take You There”, which reached #73 on the same chart, but also peaked at #21 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The other two singles did not chart, but “Raw” and “Set It Off” popularized Big Daddy Kane’s high-speed style and abundant use of word play. “Raw” and “Ain’t No Half Steppin’” are both described as “underground sensation[s]” and “classic[s]” by Allmusic’s Steve Huey. “Raw” does not appear on Long Live the Kane, but a remix which utilizes the same beat does.\n\nBig Daddy Kane’s debut album contains many tracks that were later featured on greatest hits compilations. “Ain’t No Half Steppin’” alone is featured on The Very Best of Big Daddy Kane, Marley Marl’s House of Hits, two “best of” Cold Chillin’ Records compilations and over five additional hip-hop hit compilations. Nowithstanding “Ain’t No Half Steppin’,” The Very Best of Big Daddy Kane contains five songs from Kane’s debut album. Allmusic’s Steve Huey regards “‘Raw,’ ‘Set It Off,’ and ‘Ain’t No Half-Steppin’ [as] flawless bids for immortality [that] haven’t lost an ounce of energy.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- The album comes in at #6 on Ego Trip’s Top 25 Rap Albums of 1988.\n\n- The single ‘Ain’t No Half Steppin’’ comes in at #3 on Ego Trip’s Top 40 Rap Singles of 1988.\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Youtube / Spotify\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nPublic Enemy ‘It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back’ 30th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 28th June 1988\n\nLabel: Def Jam\n\nProducers: Chuck D, Hand Shocklee, Rick Rubin\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back is the second studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy, released on June 28, 1988, by Def Jam Recordings. Public Enemy set out to make the hip hop equivalent to Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On, an album noted for its strong social commentary. Recording sessions took place during 1987 at Chung King Studios, Greene St. Recording, and Sabella Studios in New York City. Noting the enthusiastic response toward their live shows, Public Enemy intended with Nation of Millions to make the music of a faster tempo than the previous album for performance purposes.\n\nThe album charted for 49 weeks on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number 42. By August 1989, it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of one million copies in the United States. The album was very well received by music critics, who hailed it for its production techniques and the socially and politically charged lyricism of lead MC Chuck D. It also appeared on many publications’ year-end top album lists for 1988 and was the runaway choice as the best album of 1988 in The Village Voice’s Pazz & Jop critics’ poll, a poll of the leading music critics in the US. Since its initial reception, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back has been regarded by music writers and publications as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 48 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the highest ranking of all the hip hop albums on the list, and the only one acknowledged in the top hundred.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- The album comes in at #1 on Ego Trip’s Top 25 Rap Albums of 1988.\n\n- The single ‘Don’t Believe the Hype’ comes in at #6 on Ego Trip’s Top 40 Rap Singles of 1988.\n\n- The track ‘Don’t Believe the Hype’ appears on our 1988 Rap Megamix.\n\n- The tracks ‘Don’t Believe the Hype’ and ‘Security of the First World’ appears on Classic Material 1988 Mixtape.\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Youtube / Spotify\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nEPMD ‘Strictly Business’ 30th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 7th June 1988\n\nLabel: Fresh / Sleeping Bag\n\nProducers: EPMD\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“Strictly Business is the debut album by golden age hip-hop duo EPMD. It was released on June 7, 1988, by Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records around the world and BCM Records in Germany. It peaked at No. 80 on the Billboard 200 soon after release, yet it earned an RIAA gold album certification within four months of its release. In addition, it has received much positive critical attention since its release. In 2003, the album was ranked number 459 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album is known for its lighthearted party raps and funky sample-reliant production. The album has no guest emcees or producers except DJ K La Boss. The album is broken down track-by-track by the group in Brian Coleman’s book Check the Technique.\n\nStrictly Business peaked at No. 80 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.

Although none of the singles reached the Billboard Hot 100, the album was able to go gold within four months of its release. Initial reviews of the album were strong: Allmusic gave the album a five star rating calling the album “simply amazing”. The Source assigned the album a 5-mike rating making it one of 43 albums to ever receive this rating. Robert Christgau also gave it an A- rating soon after its release.

After the 1987 murder of DJ-producer Scott La Rock, MC KRS-One moved away from the violent themes that dominated his debut, Criminal Minded, and began writing socially conscious songs using the moniker the Teacher. Many themes, which surface a minimalist production accompanied by hard-hitting drum beats, cover social issues that include government and police corruption, safe sex, government involvement in the drug trade, and violence in the hip hop community. As of September 25, 1989, the album was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America. Both the album cover, depicting KRS-One, and the album title make reference to Malcolm X. The album’s cover art is a reference to the iconic photo of Malcolm X peering through his window while holding a M1 carbine rifle. The album title is a modification of Malcolm X’s famous phrase “By Any Means Necessary. The album is widely seen as one of, if not the first, politically conscious efforts in hip-hop. AllMusic described the album as a landmark of political hip hop and Rolling Stone praised its social commentary. Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote, “Over irresistible beats provided by his BDP cohorts, KRS delivers the word on the drug trade, AIDS and violence—three forces that threaten to destroy minority communities.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- The album comes in at #5 on Ego Trip’s Top 25 Rap Albums of 1988.\n\n- The single ‘My Philosophy’ comes in at #4 on Ego Trip’s Top 40 Rap Singles of 1988.\n\n- The tracks ‘Jimmy’, ‘Still #1’ and ‘Stop the Violence’ appear on our 1988 Rap Megamix.\n\n- The tracks ‘Still #1’ and ‘My Philosophy’ appear on our Classic Material 1988 Mixtape.\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Youtube / Spotify\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nShow & AG ‘Full Scale’ 20th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 24th May 1998\n\nLabel: D.I.T.C\n\nProducers: Show\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“Full Scale is a 1998 release from hip hop duo Show and A.G.

The LP version also includes verses from most members of their crew D.I.T.C. including Diamond D, Big L and Lord Finesse. Two versions were released at different times; the original Full Scale EP was released on 12” vinyl in early 1998 and featured 5 songs together with the instrumentals. Around 2002 a CD version, titled Full Scale LP and using the same artwork, was released. This version included the 5 songs found on the EP together with 10 additional tracks which had originally been released on various 12” singles and projects in the late 1990s. Four of the songs on the CD edition had also appeared on the self-titled D.I.T.C. album released on Tommy Boy Records in 2000. The songs were “Dignified Soldiers”, “Drop It Heavy”, “Spit (Remix)” and “Time To Get This Money”. Two of these appeared as remixes while the remaining two appeared virtually unchanged. Production on all songs on the Full Scale EP is handled by Showbiz and A.G. themeselves.

While the new record did not maintain the same popularity as its predecessor, it obtained platinum status and spawned the favorites “Run’s House” and “Mary, Mary”. Despite being given a mixed reception at the time of its release, it is now hailed as a seminal classic in hip-hop and many see it as an underrated album. In response to albums such as Eric B. & Rakim’s Paid In Full, Public Enemy’s It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back, and Boogie Down Productions’ Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary, the group made a distinct departure from their earlier work, as Jam-Master Jay used a heavier amount of sampling. Run and DMC also made changes in their rapping style (heavily influenced by Rakim) as techniques such as alliteration, polysyllabic rhyming, and internal rhyme are found in songs like “I’m Not Going Out Like That,” “Radio Station,” and the title track. The group also introduces storytelling to their arsenal in “Ragtime.” Despite this, Run-D.M.C. do not abandon their formula of combining hip-hop beats with hard rock guitar riffs, using it in “Miss Elaine,” the title track, “Soul To Rock And Roll,” and “Mary, Mary.”“\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- The album comes in at #12 on Ego Trip’s Top 25 Rap Albums of 1988.\n\n- The single ‘Run’s House / Beats to the Rhyme’ comes in at #5 on Ego Trip’s Top 40 Rap Singles of 1988.\n\n- The track ‘Beats to the Rhyme’ appears on our 1988 Rap Megamix.\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Youtube / Spotify\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nMasta Ace Incorporated ‘Slaughtahouse’ 25th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 4th May 1993\n\nLabel: Delicious Vinyl\n\nProducers: Uneek, Latief, Ase One, Bluez Brothas, The Beatheads\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“SlaughtaHouse is the first album from hip hop group Masta Ace Incorporated, and the second overall album from rapper Masta Ace. The loose concept of the album is addressing the growing trend of violence in hip-hop music at the time, notably from Gangsta rap.

This version became a hit single in 1994, reaching the Top 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also presaged a new bass-heavy direction on his next album, Sittin’ on Chrome.\n\nSlaughtaHouse was mainly produced in-house by members of the I.N.C. such as Uneek, Ase One (Masta Ace’s producer alias) and the production duo The Bluez Brothas; consisting of Lord Digga and Witchdoc.

It was released on March 23, 1993 via Rhyme $yndicate/Priority Records. This album was originally set to be released in 1992 as part of his deal with Sire/Warner Bros. Records, and supposed to be Ice-T’s first official release as an artist on his own Rhyme $yndicate record label, now in full control of the content of the release, as part of a new distribution deal with Priority Records.\n\nHome Invasion was the first album that Ice-T released following the controversy over the Body Count song “Cop Killer”. Sire/Warner Bros. Records had stood by freedom of expression during the controversy, although some within the Time Warner conglomerate now favored a more pragmatic policy. The album was originally set for a November 15, 1992 release, but the Rodney King riots were still fresh in people’s minds, an election was in process, and political releases by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre were causing controversy, so Ice-T agreed to postpone Home Invasion’s release, in addition to removing the song “Ricochet”, which had already appeared on the soundtrack to the film of the same name.\n\nWith the album’s release postponed to February 14, 1993, Sire/Warner Bros. told Ice-T that it would not release the album with its current artwork, painted by Dave Halili (cover artist for Body Count), which depicted a white youth who is seemingly immersed in black culture surrounded by images of violence, mayhem and disorder. Although the catalog number 45119 was already assigned to it and the single “Gotta Lotta Love” was released, the album was still deferred. Ice-T initially agreed, opting for an all-black cover and a name change to The Black Album. He later realized that his future output was going to be continuously monitored and censored, so he left the label amicably, signing a distribution deal with Priority Records, which released the album with the originally intended artwork. Due to the postponed release of the album, tracks were altered to keep the topics up-to-date.”\n\nAdditional info:\n\n- Listen to samples used in the making of the album on WhoSampled.\n\nListen: Youtube / Spotify\n\nPurchase: Discogs\n\nLords of the Underground ‘Here Come the Lords’ 25th Anniversary\n\nRelease date: 30th March 1993\n\nLabel: Pendulum / Elektra\n\nProducers: Marley Marl, K-Def, Lord Jazz\n\nProfile (courtesy of Wikipedia):\n\n“‘Here Come the Lords’ is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Lords of the Underground, released on March 30, 1993 by Pendulum and Elektra Records.
