After the release of their first album, the group was mentored by fellow New Jersey native Queen Latifah, and subsequently changed their name.\n\nNaughty by Nature's first hit was \"O.P.P.\", which sampled the Jackson 5's hit \"ABC\" and was released in 1991 on their self-titled album Naughty by Nature. The album generated another hit with a reworking of Bob Marley's \"No Woman No Cry\" called \"Everything's Gonna Be All Right\" (the track was also called \"Ghetto Bastard\" on some explicit releases). That song detailed the experiences of Treach growing up in poverty, and now rising up to live a better life. Powered by the success of that song and \"O.P.P.\", their self-titled album went platinum. Tupac made a cameo appearance in the music video Uptown Anthem for the Juice soundtrack.\n\n​\n\nGURU\n\nKeith Edward Elam (July 17, 1961 – April 19, 2010), better known by his stage name Guru was an American rapper and record producer.

Eric B. and Rakim released their first single, \"Eric B. Is President,\" in 1986. Eric B. included an uncredited sample of James Brown's \"Funky President\" on the track which led Brown to sue the duo, in one of the earliest court cases related to sampling in hip-hop. The duo then went on to release their debut album, Paid in Full, in 1987. This album was highly acclaimed immediately upon its release, and has come to be regarded as one of the greatest albums in hip-hop history; Eric B. has been praised for his \"martial and percussive\" production and effective use of samples on the album.\n\nAfter three more albums, Eric B. and Rakim's record contract with MCA came to a close. Concerned that Rakim might abandon him, Eric B. refused to sign the release contract, leading to a protracted legal battle between him, Rakim, and the label.This situation led the duo to split up completely in 1992. After separating from Rakim, Eric B. released one solo album - 1995's Eric B. - but primarily worked as a producer and executive for Street Life Records, a now-defunct subsidiary of Scotti Brothers Records.NEric B. and Rakim fell out of contact after they ceased to collaborate musically, but in 2016, they reconnected and announced their reunion. The duo has once again begun holding concerts, and is working on remastering their albums, but indicated that they were not planning to release new music.\n\nEric B was part of the Death Row East with Tupac and that the first artist for Death Row East was Craig Mack. He also stated on the Flip the Script podcast in 2017 that the beef with Nas was squashed after he convince Tupac to speak to him at Bryant Park.\n\nBIG DRIC\n\nMajesty, the brother of Big Stretch and member of Live Squad would go on to clarify a mystery around one of Tupac’s most renowned songs – ”God Bless The Dead”. Majesty spoke about the lyrics being dedicated to a person with the nickname Biggie Smalls, but it had nothing to do with the famous Christopher Wallace. The lyric was intended to honor the memory of Big Dric, who was a close friend of Tupac and the Live Squad. As Majesty recalls, Dric had nothing to do with the musical world and would never rap. Rather than that, he was a graffiti artist, who had a fantastic bond with Pac from the start, which fueled the sentiment in the soul of the fallen great.\n\nFREDDIE FOXXX\n\nJames Campbell (born March 27, 1969), better known by his stage names Freddie Foxxx and Bumpy Knuckles, is an American rapper and music producer from Long Island, New York.

Later in 1986 he was slated to meet with producer Eric B. who was searching for an MC to pair up with; Foxxx missed the meeting, and Eric B. ended up pairing up with MC Rakim and forming the group Eric B. and Rakim.\n\nDespite this, Foxxx's first LP, Freddie Foxxx Is Here, was produced entirely by Eric B. and Foxxx and was released in 1989 through MCA Records. He soon parted ways with the label and became a member of Queen Latifah's Flavor Unit establishment. In 1993, only promo copies of his second album, Crazy Like A Foxxx, were circulated when Epic Records decided to shelve it.\n\n​\n\nREDMAN\n\nReginald Noble (born April 17, 1970), better known by his stage name Redman, is an American rapper, DJ, record producer, and actor. He rose to fame in the early 1990s as an artist on the Def Jam label. He is well known for his collaborations with his close friend Method Man, as one-half of the rap duo Method Man & Redman, including their starring roles in films and sitcoms. He was also a member of the Def Squad in the late 1990s. In 1990, Redman made his official debut on EPMD's album Business as Usual, appearing on the tracks \"Hardcore\" and \"Brothers on My Jock\".\n\nIn 1992, Redman released his debut album, Whut? Thee Album, which AllMusic noted for blending \"reggae and funk influences\" with a \"terse, though fluid rap style\". The album peaked at number forty-nine on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold. He was named \"Rap Artist of the Year\" by The Source. Redman followed this up with his 1994 album, Dare Iz a Darkside. The first single, \"Rockafella\", samples Leon Haywood's \"I Want'a Do Something Freaky to You\" and George Clinton's \"Flash Light\", two of the most sampled songs in hip hop. Redman's second album was notable for having most of the tracks produced by the artist himself (later on Redman would let other producers make most of his beats). During this time he used former mentor Erick Sermon to produce his records, including \"Pick It Up\" and \"Whateva Man\" from Muddy Waters.\n\nOn December 10, 1996, Redman released his third album Muddy Waters, which was highly praised by critics. The album featured two of his Billboard's hit singles: \"Whateva Man\" and \"It's Like That (My Big Brother)\". The song \"Do What You Feel\" appeared on the soundtrack to the video game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 12, 1997.

Nicknamed \"Iron Mike\" and \"Kid Dynamite\" in his early career, and later known as \"The Baddest Man on the Planet\", Tyson is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old, Tyson holds the record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title. He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, as well as the only heavyweight to unify them in succession. The following year, Tyson became the lineal champion when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round. In 1990, Tyson was knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in history.\n\nIn 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison, although he was released on parole after three years. After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights, regaining the WBA and WBC titles in 1996 to join Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Tim Witherspoon, Evander Holyfield and George Foreman as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after losing it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield by an eleventh round stoppage. Their 1997 rematch ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's ears, one bite notoriously being strong enough to remove a portion of his right ear. In 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title, losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis. Tyson and Shakur were very close friends up until the latter's untimely death. They became particularly tight while Tyson was in prison Tupac would show him support.\n\nBIG DADDY KANE\n\nAntonio Hardy (born September 10, 1968), better known by his stage name Big Daddy Kane, is an American rapper who began his career in 1986 as a member of the Juice Crew. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and skilled MCs in hip hop. Rolling Stone ranked his song \"Ain't No Half-Steppin'\" number 25 on its list of The 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time, calling him \"a master wordsmith of rap's late-golden age and a huge influence on a generation of MCs\". Big Daddy Kane had the chance to collaborate with Tupac in 96 on Wherever U Are and Too Late Playa."
