        "text": "Eight years later, New York City still stands.\n\nUnfortunately, I’m not sure I can say the same about the NYC hip-hop scene. Of course, there’s a few artists still carrying the torch, including that dude who’s about to have the 11th #1 album of his career. But 2009 is in sharp contrast to the days when the Empire State was THE place to be. Whereas now, many NY artists make creative stretches to appeal to the rest of the United States, there was a time when the rest of the U.S. was aiming to do what THEY were doing.\n\nBut that started changing in the early-’90s. With more and more artists coming out of Cali and other areas, NY wasn’t the only show in town anymore. The success of N.W.A. led to more and more West Coast acts being signed, and they were coming out with heavier topics than most East Coast artists were covering. That’s not to say New York wasn’t still coming out with good music, but Cali’s music was gaining on them in terms of popularity. Then, in ’92, Dr. Dre‘s The Chronic album came out and officially swung the momentum to the left.\n\nBy late-’93, it was obvious that the West Coast was in the forefront of the rap game. To many East Coast heads, it wasn’t so much that the New York scene was non-existent or anything, but it appeared to be in need of a new movement. Even though there were still some notable records coming out of there, it was clear that Onyx and Das EFX (or the bunch of groups that sounded like them) weren’t exactly gonna lead the league. NYC needed new blood that could create enough energy to have a strong presence that would match what Dre, Snoop, Ice Cube, ‘Pac, etc. were doing.\n\nMuch like how NY’s felt over the last five years or so, there was an urgency to get back in the game. “G-Funk” was making impact all over while the East Coast sound was only hitting it big on the East Coast. Not to mention, the South was on the rise. The difference between then and now, however, is that the up-and-coming artists from New York got focused. They didn’t try to sound like they were from Cali, they didn’t spend more time complaining than recording, and they didn’t make mediocre records while claiming to “bring New York back”. They put their hoodies and Tims on, and stomped onto the scene with quality music.\n\nA lot of them still weren’t necessarily doing Doggystyle numbers or getting heavy MTV airplay, but their presence wasn’t going unnoticed. There was the Wu-Tang Clan, who brought in new images, new slang, and new sounds. There was Nas, who played a big part in bringing lyricism back into a world of tiggedy-tiggedy-tongue-twistin’ shit. There was the Boot Camp Click, who may not have become superstars, but still had a heavy movement on the underground/street level. And then, there was Bad Boy Records, which brought forth a mainstream-viable but street-credible sound comparable to what Death Row was doing out West.\n\nThere was a new look for a city that had been in a holding pattern through the previous couple years. Producers like DJ Premier and The RZA were providing the beats that helped push things forward. The subject matter was deeper, the concepts got more creative, the lyrics got better. Eventually, it did start translating to major mainstream success, and by ’96, New York City was back on top of the game. Of course, that success also came with conflict and even some internal turmoil, but the power was back on in the city.\n\nAs someone who liked all of the different styles from different areas, I gotta admit that I was rooting for the East Coast to get back on top. I felt like they were putting out the better material but being overlooked at one point. It was a classic time because it seemed like friendly (or maybe-not-friendly) competition had these niggas makin’ some excellent shit one after another. Some of the artists themselves have since noted that they were all vying to be the shit back then, which of course resulted in some great albums and singles.\n\nToday, the industry is totally different, and I doubt the few signed artists from NY have the creative space to do what those dudes did. But if there is still any intention to “bring it back”, a lot can be learned from the creative spirit that fueled the ’93-’95 era.\n\nWu-Tang Clan “Protect Ya Neck” (1993)\n\nJeru The Damaja “Come Clean” (1993)\n\nBlack Moon “I Got Cha Opin” (Remix) (1994)\n\nNas “New York State Of Mind” (1994)\n\nO.C. “Time’s Up” (1994)\n\nMic Geronimo “Shit’s Real” (1994)\n\nIll & Al Skratch “Where My Homiez” (1994)\n\nMethod Man “Bring The Pain” (1994)\n\nCraig Mack feat. The Notorious B.I.G., Rampage, LL Cool J & Busta Rhymes “Flava In Ya Ear (Remix)” (1994)\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G. “One More Chance (Hip-Hop Remix)” (1995)\n\nLost Boyz “Jeeps, Lex Coupes, Bimaz, & Benz” (1995)\n\nMobb Deep feat. Nas & Raekwon “Eye For An Eye” (1995)\n\nBlahzay Blahzay “Danger” (1995)\n\nSmif-N-Wessun “Sound Bwoy Burial” (1995)\n\nSmoothe Da Hustler feat. Trigga Tha Gambler “Broken Language” (1995)\n\n-D!\n\nOne thing I always looked forward to back in the ’90s was getting to hear Hot 97.\n\nTwice a year, my aunt would charter a bus and my family rolled up to Times Square for a whole day. In addition to being in NYC and coppin’ a GANG of records from Rock & Soul, I was always amped to listen to Hot on my Walkman while walkin’ thru the city. I’d read and heard about the station, but being in B-More, I never got to hear it. Whenever we went on the shopping trips, once we got up in the NY/New Jersey areas, I had 97.1 locked in. It was damn near depressing when we’d be on the way back home and the signal would start slowly dying out as we ventured out of Jersey.\n\nAh, well… here’s some ’90s-era freestyles from Hot 97. Of course, most of the verses ended up being heard on these artists’ albums, but fukkit. HUGE shoutout to Newark88 on the assist.\n\nCanibus, DMX, & Noreaga (1998): Good God Damn… on one night in early ’98, these three became the most-anticipated new jacks for the year. I happened to catch this whole thing on a mixtape in ’98, and I must’ve played the livin’ shit out of it. Funkmaster Flex plays the breakbeats and they go in.\n\nBoot Camp Clik (1996): The whole crew- Buckshot, Smif-N-Wessun, Heltah Skeltah, and OGC– is in the building. Flex keeps it BCC by playing all of their instrumentals. A couple of these niggas were on some OTHER shit, but classic Boot Camp antics throughout.\n\nOl’ Dirty Bastard (1995): Not quite as crazy as you’d expect ODB to be with a live mic, but still crazy by normal standards. Over Smoothe Da Hustler’s “Broken Language” instrumental, Dirty does what he does best- a complete train wreck with entertainment value unmatched by most.\n\nProdigy & Big Noyd (1997): Back when Prodigy’s lyrics were still worth a damn, he and Noyd rep the QBC. Resident Mobb Deep hook girl Chinky chimes in as well, singing the hook from the Mobb’s “Reach”. P sounds particularly focused here, with a couple of jabs aimed at the next artists on the list…\n\nDef Squad (1998): Redman, Keith Murray, and Erick Sermon came together (no Erick) for a solid lil’ album in ’98, and I’m guessing that this is around the time it dropped. I always wanted to hear Red rhyme on the “Who Shot Ya” beat, so there’s the redeeming quality.\n\nMase, Killa Cam, & Cardan (1997): “Here’s how we do in Harlem World“. Mase and the crew come thru, right in time to plug his debut album and drop heat on Clue’s Monday Night Mixtape show. Cam lets everybody know that they kilt it at the end, in case you were just tuning in.\n\n(IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: The First Freestyle Friday)\n\n-D!"
