        "text": "Camilo Jose Cela, the flamboyant Spanish writer who compared winning the Nobel Prize for literature to a game of tennis, has died at the age of 85.\n\nCela, who wrote 10 novels as well as essays, poems and travel books, had been suffering from heart disease.\n\nThe son of a Spanish father and English mother, Cela was credited with creating the 'tremendismo' style of writing, his straightforward, dark prose contrasting sharply with the lyricism of previous Spanish writers. He served in General Franco's army during the Spanish civil war but later rejected Franco's dictatorial rule, publishing an anti-fascist magazine that became a forum for opposition to the dictatorship.\n\nHe published his first novel, The Family of Pascal Duarte, when he was just 26 but was best known for The Hive which, published in 1951, drew on his experiences during the civil war and life afterwards under the Franco regime. It was banned in Spain for many years.\n\nCela was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1989 for what the Swedish academy described as his \"rich and intensive prose which, with restrained compassion, forms a challenging vision of man's vulnerability\". On hearing he had won, Cela modestly said it could have gone to many other Spanish writers and that, like a game of tennis, \"this time I won\".\n\nThe violence and brutality of his books contrasted starkly with the flamboyant lifestyle he enjoyed. Known for his love of food, travel and women, he cited his friend Ernest Hemingway as his greatest influence.\n\nThe Spanish novelist and essayist Francisco Umbral said Cela's death represented the \"disappearance of the last great Spanish writer, creator of fables, of language, of words, with a prodigious capacity of expression\".\n\nCela, who is survived by his wife and son, once said that he would like his epitaph to read \"Here lies someone who tried to screw his fellow man as little as possible\"."
