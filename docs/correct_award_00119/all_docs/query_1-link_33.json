        "text": "Camilo José Cela was a renowned Spanish writer from the post war Spanish literature period. For his contribution to the literature, he was awarded with Nobel Prize in 1989. Before venturing into a career in literature, he explored other fields like medicine, philosophy and law. However, during the the Spanish Civil War, he gave up his studies and began his career in literature. Camilo José Cela strived to write novels of a free genre; he used his creativity and observation to present each of his novels as different from the previous. He was considered a pioneer in the ‘tremendismo’ style of narration, which was marked by a tendency to emphasize violence and grotesque imagery. Camilo José Cela’s novels were a mix of various elements like tenderness, oral nonchalance, horror, humour and eschatological phrasing. He published 14 novels in the course of his career, apart from poems, travelogues, scripts, plays and articles. He was known to have a huge fan following in Spain and Latin America. Camilo José Cela is among the principal authors that are studied in literature schools in Spain and his works are considered as classics."
