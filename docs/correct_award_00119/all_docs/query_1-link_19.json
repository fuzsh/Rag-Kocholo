        "text": "Camilo José Cela and Padrón are two names that always go together in the minds of lovers of Spanish literature. And it is that Padrón, our small municipality, is the place where the author was born. Being, in addition, a constant presence in his work.\n\nA great little story\n\nWe know that we have a long history and great cultural richness. Founded in Roman times, witness to numerous battles and historical events. Padrón also stands out for our gastronomy and for having a large number of granaries and cruceiros, a sample of the rich architectural heritage of the area.\n\nFor Camilo José Cela, Padrón was always a source of inspiration. In his work, the writer reflects on the daily life of the city and its people, focusing on the small details that make it unique. Padrón appears in many of his books, such as \"The Family of Pascual Duarte\", \"La colmena\" or \"Viaje a la Alcarria\". In them, Cela describes with great precision and realism the landscapes, customs and traditions of the town.\n\nIn addition, Cela had a great relationship with Padrón. The writer always maintained a strong attachment to his homeland and was a defender of Galician roots and cultural identity. In fact, in 1986 he founded the Camilo José Cela Foundation, with the aim of promoting and disseminating Galician and Spanish culture.\n\nNobel Prize since Padrón\n\nIn the foundation you can find numerous personal belongings of the writer, as well as a library specializing in his work and Galician literature. In addition, cultural activities such as exhibitions, conferences, workshops and poetry recitals are organized. This foundation is located just a kilometer and a half from the Hotel Scala, and can be visited from Monday to Friday. On its façade we can find the motto of the Marquisate that was awarded to him for his literary merits: “El que resiste, Gana”.\n\nCela always maintained his commitment to literature and his land. In 1989 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the first Spanish writer to do so. In his acceptance speech, Cela spoke of Padrón and his link with the town:\n\n\"Galicia, the land of my origin, which I love so much and to which I feel united by the most intimate ties of memory, language and culture, has been the natural and spiritual framework for a good part of my work. In it, and particularly in Padrón, the small city where my family comes from, are the roots of my being\".\n\nCamilo José Cela and Padrón are two names that complement each other and are part of the same story. The Galician municipality was the home of the writer and the setting for many of his most emblematic works. And Cela, in turn, was one of the greatest ambassadors of our culture, taking the name of Padrón throughout the world."
