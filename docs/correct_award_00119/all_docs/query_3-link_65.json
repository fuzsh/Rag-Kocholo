Upon awarding the prize to Cela, the Swedish Academy praised the author \"for a rich and intensive prose, which with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision of man's vulnerability,\" related Sheila Rule for the New York Times. In the same article, Rule reported Julio Ortego's statement that \"Cela represents the searching for a better literature from the Franco years, through the democratic experiments and into European Spain. At the same time, he remained very Spanish, keeping the cultural traditions of Spanish art and literature in his writing. He did not follow a European literature, but developed his own style, and so, in his way, symbolized Spain's going through a long period of adjustment.\" Throughout the Franco regime, Cela suffered from heavy governmental censorship. Many of his books were banned outright or removed from the shelves: the second edition of Pascual Duarte was seized; the censor found it \"nauseating,\" and The Hive was initially published in South America. D. W. McPheeters maintained in Camilo José Cela that, in spite of such opposition, Cela \"has always had the courage to express himself frankly, even forthrightly, . . . which has led to problems with an overly squeamish censorship.\"\n\nCela's stylistic development moved from the more traditional Pascual Duarte to the innovative fiction of his later novels. McPheeters saw Cela as \"dedicated to a constant trying of various forms . . . of fiction in a search for the one that best suits him and . . . what he has to say concerning the human situation. He [is] an outspoken critic of traditional forms of the novel and the restrictions which [some] would impose upon the creative artist.\" Cela's first novel, The Family of Pascual Duarte, has been called the most widely read Spanish novel since Don Quixote. It was published in the early 1940s, a time when \"the Spanish novel . . . had virtually ceased to exist as a worthy genre,\" attests McPheeters. \"Almost single-handedly, Cela [gave the genre] new life and international significance.\" Many critics noted that Cela's national prominence and international fame is a result of the popularity of The Family of Pascual Duarte and a later novel, The Hive. McPheeters stated that while Pascual Duarte, Cela's first novel, \"secured a wide foreign acceptance,\" The Hive \"assured his place as one of Europe's outstanding novelists.\"\n\nPascual Duarte relates the life of a convicted murderer awaiting execution. It is introduced as a prison letter to an old family friend, but the reader soon becomes immersed in a first-person narrative. Pascual responds to a life of poverty and frustration through killing: his dog, his horse, his wife's lover, and finally, his mother, all fall victim to his rage. \"A deceptive objectivity masks the presentation of cruel and monstrous scenes, including murder and matricide,\" Michigan Quarterly Review contributor Francis Donahue described. \"In a taut style, with emotion carefully reined, Cela evokes an atmosphere of extreme brutality, one which a nation suffering from the after-effects of a brutal civil war could readily understand and believe.\" But some reviewers found such intense scenes hinder any identification with the main character. \"Pascual Duarte speaks of suffering and ferocity so appalling as to be almost beyond the reach of our sympathy. They stun even more than they horrify,\" noted Saturday Review contributor Emile Capouya.\n\nSome critics, as J. S. Bernstein stated in his introduction to Mrs. Caldwell Speaks to Her Son, credit Cela with the invention of \"tremendismo,\" a type of fiction that dwells on the darker side of life—the distasteful, the grotesque, and the vulgar. Although in his prologue to the Spanish version of Mrs. Caldwell Speaks to Her Son, Cela denies this paternity, tremendista elements are abundant in Pascual Duarte. As an example of tremendismo, McPheeters translated a portion of the struggle in which Pascual kills his mother: \"I was able to bury the blade in her throat. . . . Blood squirted out in a torrent and struck me in the face. It was warm like a belly and tasted the same as the blood of a lamb.\" Other gruesome incidents fill the pages of the novel; in one scene Pascual's retarded brother's ears are eaten off by a pig. This type of detail—meant to shock the placid reader—is present in a lesser degree or nonexistent in some of Cela's novels, but even so, a Times Literary Supplement critic called Cela's works \"perversely restricted to a pathology of human decay and loneliness.\" His Mazurca para dos muertos, for example, concludes with a six-page postmortem examination of a cadaver. Even Cela's nonfiction works such as Enciclopedia de eroticismo (the title means \"Encyclopedia of Eroticism\") and Diccionario secreto, which contains definitions of vulgar words, are written in defiance of Spain's traditionalist moral code.\n\nThe Hive led critics to compare Cela with John Dos Passos, particularly to Dos Passos's novel Manhattan Transfer, which characterizes frenetic Manhattan life. Comparisons between the two novels are based on the large number of characters introduced in both works and by the novelists' similarly cinematographic styles. In both novels, the shifting time sequence is similar to the filmmaker's flashback. But while David W. Foster conceded in Forms in the Work of Camilo José Cela that an analogy can be made between the two techniques, he noted: \"Cela's perspective goes much beyond that of the camera in what it is able to record. It is, in effect, all inclusive, omniscient, and omnipresent.\"\n\nThe Hive is frequently seen as Cela's greatest work. In Books Abroad, Jacob Ornstein and James Y. Causey noted that \"Spanish criticism has been almost unanimous in acclaiming this novel as Cela's masterpiece, both for its vigorous simplicity and for the author's artistry in evoking the atmosphere of Madrid during the final days of World War II and the years immediately following.\" The Hive's publication was typical of Cela's struggle with the censors, as it was banned in Spain and printed in Buenos Aires in 1952; William D. Montalbano reported in the Los Angeles Times that Cela presents \"a bitter chronicle of a bitter time.\" Nation contributor Maxwell Geismar found The Hive \"suffused with anger and bitterness at society in Madrid.\"\n\nMrs. Caldwell contains excerpts from the letters of a mentally disturbed woman to her dead son. McPheeters found that Mrs. Caldwell \"is about as much an anti-novel as has yet been conceived in Spain.\" The theme is incest, one ideally suited to Cela's fiction because of its shock value. The form is equally unexpected: although only slightly longer than two hundred pages, it contains two hundred and twelve chapters. There is no connection between the chapters (except for chapters fourteen and sixty) and no reason for ending the novel other than the illegibility of the last of the \"Letters from the Royal Hospital for the Insane.\"\n\nThe form and content of Tobogan de hambrientos, San Camilo, 1936, and Oficio de tinieblas 5 are also out of the ordinary. Oficio de tinieblas, for example, has no capital letters, while San Camilo, 1936 has no paragraphs. Tobogan de hambrientos, Foster noted in Forms in the Work of Camilo José Cela, \"employs many of the devices of the new novel, especially in its use of pattern and in the rejection of chronology, definable plot, and unified points of view.\" The book is divided into two hundred units. These two hundred are in turn divided in half and labeled in ascending, then, at the halfway point, in descending numerical order. Each narrative unit presents a new individual or group of individuals and the characters from the first half of the book reappear in the corresponding chapters of the second half.\n\nExcept for the epilogue, San Camilo, 1936 is a young student's continuous stream of consciousness. Again, in content and form the book is far removed from the traditional novel. The book's opening chapter, for instance, includes a list of Madrid's brothels, complete with addresses and names of proprietresses. A Times Literary Supplement reviewer remarked on the novel's unusual style: \"[Cela] reinforces his . . . contempt for petit-bourgeois credulity by quoting an enormous variety of patent medicine advertisements, [and] making astonishingly free with his sexual and other carnal references, indeed, the language of [the book] is scabrous.\" While noting Cela's emphasis on \"the erotic, obscene and scatological\" in San Camilo, 1936, Hispania contributor Robert Louis Sheehan also observed the \"stylistic innovations\" present in the novel, including \"the rhythmic reiteration of names, clauses, [and] phrases,\" the \"use of one-paragraph chapters, run-on sentences, and frequent use of commas in place of periods.\"\n\nThe name of Camilo José Cela is associated with the rebirth of the Spanish novel and with experimentation in its form and content. Pascual Duarte is credited with starting a new school of Spanish literature, while The Hive brought a new cinematographic technique to literature, which Margaret E. W. Jones in The Contemporary Spanish Novel, 1939-1975 believed \"suggested new possibilities in [the] elasticity of novelistic form.\" Jones also confirmed the author's sense of exploration, and claimed that \"Cela has consistently been at the forefront of new movements in the contemporary novel since the 1940s.\" And Cela himself summed up his feelings on his favorite genre in the dedication to Journey to the Alcarria—which Jones quoted—\"-Anything goes in the novel, as long as it's told with common sense.\"\n\nIn 1999 at the age of eighty-four, Cela saw his last novel reach Spain's bestseller list. Titled Madera de Boj and published as Boxwood in English in 2002, the novel, as described by Mark Tursi in the Review of Contemporary Fiction, \"is a complex adventure that weaves and branches through varying narratives, including traditional wisdom, folklore, history, superstition, seafarers' stories, and autobiography.\" Set in Cela's native Galicia, the book is about the notorious Coast of Death (Costa de la Muerte) and the many seafarers who have lost their lives there. According to Benjamin Jones, writing in Europe, Cela told a reporter, \"There is no real plot. It is supposed to be a reflection of life, and life does not have a plot.\" Tursi praised the book's test as \"treasure trove of possibilities and potential discoveries.\" He also noted, \"Boxwood represents Cela's fullest realization of tremendismo, which combines aspects of existential philosophy and 'brutal realism' with a surreal atmosphere.\"\n\nIn 2002 Cela's biographer, Tomas Garcia Yebra, accused the late author of using ghostwriters extensively throughout his career. Most notably, Yebra named Marcial Suarez and Mariano Tudela as the ghostwriters who provided the plots and characters for two of Cela's prize-winning novels, The Cross of Saint Andrew and Mazurka for Two Dead Men.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nCela, Camilo José, La familia de Pascual Duarte, Aldecoa (Madrid, Spain), 1942, translation by John Marks published as Pascual Duarte's Family, Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1946, translation by Anthony Kerrigan published as The Family of Pascual Duarte, Little, Brown, 1964, reprinted, Dalkey Archive Press (Normal, IL), 2004\n\nCela, Camilo José, Mrs. Caldwell habla con su hijo, Destino (Barcelona, Spain), 1953, translation by Jerome S.
