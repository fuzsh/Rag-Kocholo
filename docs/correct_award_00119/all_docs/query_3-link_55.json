        "text": "The MacJannet Prize for Global Citizenship, launched in 2009, recognizes exemplary university student civic engagement programs around the world. Today the Prize is a key element in the MacJannet Foundation’s work to build a community of global citizens. The prize is sponsored jointly by the MacJannet Foundation and the Talloires Network, a global association of 417 universities in 79 countries on six continents, all committed to developing student leaders who are actively engaged with society.\n\nIn addition to providing international recognition to outstanding student initiatives for civic engagement and community service, the Prize grants a financial contribution and encourages communication among the groups to share their experiences and strengthen their effectiveness.\n\nCheck out profiles of our 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018 , 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 prize recipients.\n\nThe MacJannet Prize was established in order to:\n\nRecognize and encourage exceptional student community engagement and community service\n\nFinancially support the ongoing work of university-based civic initiatives\n\nElevate innovative civic engagement program models and disseminate them throughout the Network as examples of promising practices\n\nStrengthen public support for the global civic engagement movement in higher education\n\nChampion the values and extend the legacy of Donald and Charlotte MacJannet, who devoted their lives to fostering international understanding\n\nPromote action around the principles of the Talloires Declaration, which recommends steps to elevate the civic engagement of universities around the world\n\n2022 MacJannet Prize for Global Citizenship Winners\n\nQMLAC students outside of a prison taking part in a community education project\n\n2022 First Place Winner: Queen Mary University of London Legal Advice Centre (QMLAC), Queen Mary University of London (United Kingdom)\n\nThe Queen Mary Legal Advance Centre (QMLAC) is a free community law centre based in the University’s Law Department. It brings together undergraduate law students, QMLAC staff and volunteer qualified lawyers to provide free legal advice services and public legal education initiatives to the local community. It embodies the University’s own history, one with its roots as the People’s Palace – designed to improve the lives of poor communities in London’s East End, through cultural and educational opportunities. The university continues this educational mission today, using public engagement and service in its daily work. This work has been recognized with the award of a Platinum Engage Watermark from the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement.\n\nThe location of the QMLAC is a vibrant and multi-cultural area, but one which has significant poverty and need (East London is regularly the lowest scoring area in the Trust for London’s, ‘Poverty Profile’). The Centre was founded by the Law School in 2006 to meet a need for the community to have access to free legal advice. It was the first law clinic of its kind at a London university.\n\nIt provides free client-centred 1-2-1 legal advice (and sometimes representation) to the public as well as community-based public legal education projects. Qualified volunteer lawyers supervise all work and legal advice delivered by law students. Student opportunities are both curricular and extra-curricular.\n\nThe clinical legal education aspect of the centre’s work is providing students with ‘real life’ experience with assisting people who are in need of access to justice, and ensuring they understand and develop a lifelong commitment to the value and importance of pro bono work, for them personally, as well as the wider community. It is a symbiotic relationship where students and clients benefit from engaging with the other.\n\nThe QMLAC team has 8 members of staff (funded by the University), in addition to the students and lawyer volunteers. The QMLAC has a volunteer External Advisory Board made up from volunteers in the legal sector, and an internal QMLAC Management Committee comprised of academics within the Department. This ensures proper and appropriate governance and accountability.\n\nThe Centre is founded on the principles of excellence, integrity, and ethics. All student opportunities have concurrent reflection classes. QMLAC teaches the ethics of lawyering and instills in students the importance of the special two-way process that they are learning and developing through the opportunity the clients give them to provide legal advice.\n\n“It is such an honour to receive the prestigious MacJannet Prize from the Talloires Network. We want to acknowledge all the volunteer lawyers, and students who donate their time to the work of the Queen Mary Legal Advice Centre; and all the clients who work with us through some of the most vulnerable times of their lives. Queen Mary University of London has built a proud culture which champions civic engagement. Without the continued support of the University and Law School, the mission and work of the Queen Mary Legal Advice Centre would not be possible. We will continue to strive towards enabling access to justice for all educating our future lawyers in the importance of pro bono and community service.”\n\n- Frances Ridout, Director of the Queen Mary Legal Advice Centre\n\nTIFE students\n\n2022 Second Place Winner: Teenagers in Free Enterprise (TIFE), American University of Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan)\n\nThe goal of the TIFE project is to create a platform for high-potential high school students and facilitate the development of entrepreneurial skills. TIFE strives to solve the problem of an unequal distribution of income and opportunities between different groups in society. More than half of Kyrgyzstan's population is under the age of 25, and almost a third of the population is between the ages of 15 and 25. Young people in Kyrgyzstan live in an environment where poverty and unemployment are widespread. This has a negative impact on more than 40 percent of young people: economic opportunities are very limited, access to public services is insufficient, and corruption is rampant. This makes 31 percent of young people \"fear the future or be unsure of the future.\"\n\nThe TIFE program consists of two parts: Education and Competition. During the educational part of the program, teams of high school students participate in training sessions about business modeling, design-thinking, financial modeling, and also meet with the business owners. In the competition portion of the project, teams compete to win the TIFE annual competition where one of the most valuable prizes is a 35% discount on tuition fees at the American University of Central Asia in the total amount of $34,600 for 6 TIFE winners.\n\n“We are deeply honored to receive the MacJannet Prize for Global Citizenship! Thank you for the opportunity to become a part of Talloires Networks projects and for recognizing the exceptional student community engagement activities within the American University of Central Asia initiative. This award brings a big contribution to the TIFE Accelerator and its development!” – TIFE Program Staff\n\n2022 Third Place Winner: UBANEX, University of Buenos Aires (Argentina)\n\nThe UBANEX Program was created in 2004, in response to the need for an adequate reference framework for university extension activities carried out at the University of Buenos Aires, defining University Extension as a communicational, educational, cultural and scientific process that articulates teaching and research, and makes possible a transformative relationship between university and society. The University, through university extension and in connection with teaching and research, makes its knowledge available in order to contribute to improving the quality of life of the members of its society.\n\nThrough the program, a policy scheme was developed that promotes, values, and disseminates the link between the university and the community, creating new knowledge spaces to contain the complexity of the demands of the social environment, assuming the responsibility to interpret, participate, and provide responses in a field of excellence.\n\nThe program aims to stimulate social intervention with pre-designed devices, in dialogue with community social actors in the territory and area of influence of the University. These interventions are distinguished by being actions that benefit the target populations and accompany the design, articulation and reformulation of public-social policies with various state and private entities, and that, in all cases, train students guided by teaching teams.\n\n“The University Extension and Student Welfare Secretary of the University of Buenos Aires is infinitely grateful for the award given to our Program. This prioritizes and strengthens us to continue growing and encourages our students and teachers to continue along this path, trying to grow every day in order to contribute to improving the well-being of our society.” - Galli Gustavo J.\n\n\"It is an honor to receive this distinction, from our team of teachers and students we are fully grateful, this gives us strength to continue serving the community more and better every day.\" - Carlos Capuano\n\n2022 Honorable Mentions\n\nINTEGRA: Programa de integración universitaria para jóvenes refugiados, Universidad Camilo José Cela (Spain)\n\nThe goal of Proyecto INTEGRA is to facilitate the transition and acclimation of refugees entering Spain and to provide support due to the uncertainty of young refugees and their families when facing the challenges of integration in a new society. The program offers opportunities for development by providing professional job training, access to higher education, and promoting an inclusive and supportive mentality as well as critical thinking among the rest of the academic community that makes up the university ecosystem.\n\nThe Code4All Initiative, Ashesi University (Ghana)\n\nThe Code4All Initiative is a student-founded and led program that aims to empower high school students from underserved communities with software development and critical thinkings skills, thus preparing them to solve real-world problems using the power of technology. The Initiative provides mentorship and teaches basic computer skills and problem-solving through programming to students from rural and underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nThe NORTH (Navigating Ottawa Resources To Improve Health) Clinic, University of Ottawa (Canada)\n\nThe NORTH Clinic is an interdisciplinary, student-run clinic at the University of Ottawa that aims to understand underserved clients’ self-identified social needs and address them by connecting them to tailored community resources and supports. Through collaborative efforts between students and medical, legal and social work professionals, the NORTH Clinic also aims to train and equip future professionals with the tools to competently and confidently intervene on the social determinants of health.\n\n2021 MacJannet Prize for Global Citizenship Winners\n\n​2021 First Place Winner: Nine Tenths Programme (Rhodes University, South Africa)\n\nThe Nine Tenths Programme is the First Place winner of the 2021 MacJannet Prize. Born out of the need to address the unequal education sector in Makhanda, Nine Tenths provides mentorship and increased access to education to improve pass rates of local no-fee schools. Nine Tenths is co-managed by the Rhodes University Community Engagement Division (RUCE), local high schools and a local Non-profit Organisation, GADRA Education. Programme responsibilities are carried out in a participatory manner by each partner based on their skill set and resources. Student volunteers apply to be part of the programme and are put through a rigorous training programme. Student leaders are elected, who each take responsibility for 14 volunteer mentors. These leaders are critical as conduits of information and quality assurance of sessions.\n\nThe program strives to revitalize education in Makhanda, enhance access to tertiary education and equip young people to transform their socio-economic status. The success of the program is evident in the increasing pass rates of university entrance-level exams, which have seen annual increases of approximately 30 Bachelor-level passes, with “program participants delivering at least 80% of all Bachelor-level passes produced by the six local schools.”\n\nMentor and mentee of the Nine Tenths programme; first place winner of the 2021 MacJannet Prize for Global Citizenship.\n\n2021 Second Place Winner: The Art of Giving (Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, India)\n\n​The Art of Giving program strives to share the spirit of generosity and kindness to their community and the world in order to address a variety of societal issues. The program offers resources and student-led initiatives to improve access to inclusive education, support gender equality, uplift indigenous communities and promote sustainable development. The Art of Giving program staff write that it, “acts as a bridge between students and the indigenous community. Students need to understand and empathize with the problems which exist outside the four walls of their university.” The program also partners with local community leaders who act as “change makers” and are one of the pillars of the program.\n\n2021 Second Place Winner: The Act of Giving program which includes students from the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology and the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences in India.\n\n2021 Third Place Winner: Humanizing Healthcare (University of Manchester, United Kingdom)\n\n​Shortlisted for the MacJannet prize in 2018, the Humanizing Healthcare program began as “Humanizing Dentistry” and has since expanded to the fields of optometry and pharmacy.
