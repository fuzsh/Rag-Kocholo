        "text": "The famous writer Camilo José Cela chose the region where he grew up to create his greatest wish, the headquarters of his foundation, which would house all his work, manuscripts, private collections and his own life.\n\nThe Foundation is headquartered in Iria Flavia, opposite the old Collegiate Church of Santa María de Adina, in some houses that were built as the residence of canons in the 17th century. It has a total area of 11,000 square meters, houses a library of over 45,000 volumes, an art gallery with over 700 original paintings, a 178-seat auditorium, lecture and exhibition rooms, along with an extensive landscaped area.\n\nThe John Trulock Rail Museum forms part of it and features examples of Galicia’s railway history. In different rooms visitors can admire hundreds of titles, medals and awards, among which are the Nobel Prize (1989), Cervantes Prize (1995) and Prince of Asturias Award (1987), as well as collections and objects that Camilo Jose Cela collected throughout his life and which, due to their richness and variety, surprise all visitors.\n\nThe legacy of José M ª Sánchez Silva, José García Nieto, Maria del Carmen and Fernando Pajares Escolano Huarte and manuscripts from other authors have been added to the museum as well.\n\n​"
