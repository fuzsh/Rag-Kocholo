        "text": "The Barcelona appeal court began investigating Spain's hottest literary dispute yesterday: whether the Spanish Nobel laureate Camilo Jose Cela is a cheat and plagiarist.\n\nCela, author of The Family of Pascual Duarte and winner of the 1989 literature prize, vigorously denies the accusation that he based another prize-winning novel on the work of a ghost writer.\n\nThe ghost writer, in turn, is alleged by a school teacher to have plagiarised her unpublished manuscript.\n\nCarmen Formoso's lawyers claim that Cela, 85, dashed off his novel - The Cross of Saint Andrew - in a few weeks in 1994 after being promised that if he could deliver it in time his next book would win the Â£250,000 Premio Planeta lit erary prize. The biggest publishing company in the Spanish-speaking world, Planeta offers its prize as an advance to the winning author, aiming to more than recoup the money with huge sales from prize publicity.\n\nMs Formoso entered her manuscript - Carmen, Carmela, Carmina - for the prize. There are hundreds of entrants annually, although big names usually win.\n\nShe was astounded by similarities between her novel and Cela's. She alleges a criminal and literary conspiracy in which Planeta gave her manuscript to a ghost writer.\n\nHer case has been rejected twice by lower courts but the appeal judges found \"innumerable coincidences\" and said the suspicion that Cela was promised the prize was \"not completely unfounded\"."
