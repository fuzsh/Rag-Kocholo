Secret Sunshine

“One of the ten best films of the year!” – A.O. Scott, The New York Times

In Lee’s unnerving and masterfully told tale, a young widow moves with her son to the small city where her late husband grew up. She settles in, trying to make friends among the suspicious locals, but attracting only the unwelcome attention of a shambling mechanic. And then, out of nowhere, something terrible happens, and she finds herself struggling to make sense of it all. Best Actress, Cannes Film Festival
