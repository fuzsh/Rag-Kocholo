        "text": "After the death of her husband from a traffic accident, Lee Shin-ae (Jeon Do-yeon) and her only child Jun move to Miryang, South Gyeongsang Province, her husband's hometown, to start life anew. While entering Miryang, Shin-ae's car breaks down. The local mechanic in Miryang, Kim Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), fixes her car and assists Shin-ae as she opens her piano school and attempts to purchase land to build a house on. Jong-chan claims he is only trying to be a Good Samaritan.\n\nOne afternoon, Shin-ae meets a middle-school girl (referred to as \"the girl\" from now onwards), whose father is Jun's daycare teacher, Park Do-seop. Just outside her home, Shin-ae is called by a pharmacist who tells her that the solution to her problems is belief in God. Shin-ae is skeptical, but nevertheless takes the pharmacist's scripture. At home, Shin-ae and Jun engage in a prank where Shin-ae pretends to be unable to find Jun.\n\nShin-ae's brother visits from Seoul, wondering why she has returned to Miryang considering that her husband cheated on her. Shin-ae denies this, but still hates her late husband for unspecified reasons. Before leaving, Shin-ae's brother tells Jong-chan that he is not Shin-ae's type.\n\nOne night, Shin-ae returns home late after partying to discover that Jun is missing. She receives a phone call (implied to be from Jun's kidnapper) and draws all of the money from her bank account to pay as ransom. Appalled at the pitiful amount of money she paid, Shin-ae reveals that her claim to buying land was a lie to appear rich; she really had no more money.\n\nReturning home, Shin-ae discovers the girl peering into her residence; the latter refuses to explain why and escapes. Later, police officers arrive to take her to a reservoir, where Jun was drowned. The murderer is swiftly captured and is revealed to be Jun's daycare teacher, Park Do-seop, but Shin-ae doesn't seem to be vengeful and sheds no tears at Jun's funeral.\n\nFeeling unwell one day, Shin-ae visits the pharmacist who convinces her to join their faith, even though Shin-ae doesn't understand why God would let an innocent child like Jun die. Followed around by Jong-chan, Shin-ae soon becomes a believer and claims to have found inner peace; even Jong-chan starts going to church.\n\nAt home one day, Shin-ae hears noises in her bathroom and opens the door, crying out Jun's name, but the bathroom user is a little boy from Jun's daycare. Dropping off the other daycare children, Shin-ae witnesses the girl being bullied but doesn't intervene.\n\nShin-ae's church friends throw her a birthday party, during which she states that she will visit Park Do-seop, now in prison, to forgive him. Jong-chan doesn't understand why she needs to visit him to forgive him, but nevertheless accompanies her. Surprisingly, Do-seop reveals that he found God as well and that God has absolved him of his sins. Shin-ae doesn't understand how God can forgive him before she has.\n\nOne day, Shin-ae steals a CD of a song called \"Lies\" from a store and blasts it on a loudspeaker where a group has gathered to thank God. Later that night, she receives a phone call, which she claims to Jong-chan to have been from the kidnapper; he dismisses the idea but tells her to calm down and arranges a dinner date for the next day. However, Shin-ae walks into the pharmacy and seduces the pharmacist's husband, but he is unable to perform and Shin-ae becomes sick. Later that evening, she goes to Jong-chan, who angrily rejects her proposal for sex. On the way home, she passes by a vigil held for her by the pharmacist couple; it is interrupted when a rock is hurled at a window. At home, Shin-ae slashes her wrists.\n\nOn the day she is discharged from the hospital, Jong-chan takes her to a salon, where the girl now works, to do her hair. She reveals that she went into juvenile detention for falling in with the wrong crowd and quit school. In the middle of her cut, Shin-ae leaves the salon. At home, she begins cutting her own hair. Jong-chan arrives, offering to hold up a mirror for her."
