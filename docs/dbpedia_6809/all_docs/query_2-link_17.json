        "text": "Monster (Japanese/2023/Prime): It's a shame that Japan didn't select this film as their Academy Awards entry and chose 'Perfect Days'. Plus had it been so, 'The Teachers' Lounge' from Germany wouldn't have made the cut. Ironically the combo of these (Japan and School themed film) is what 'Monster' is, which I found better than its director Hirokazu Koreeda's previous film, the Academy Award-nominated 'Shoplifters' (2018). The film, which won the Best Screenplay Award at the Cannes Festival 2023, revolves around two children in the same school which is marred by morality and lies. How does this impact these children who develop a tender bond, forms the rest of the film. A true winner in terms of storytelling, it also gives a hint of 'Rashomon' (1950) in terms of projecting the 'truth' and the complexity of the layered characters. The makers cleverly depict a single progression of the events from different characters in three different phases and bring us new layers in entirety. There are multiple contemporary and global themes which have been blended beautifully and subtly through its characters. Truly one of the finest Japanese films in recent years.\n\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è Want to Get Better at Film Analysis? Check out semiotics with these 3 resources! Do you feel lost when people start talking about symbolism in film? I struggled with symbolism for a long time. I watched movies and took them at face value. But I always felt like I was missing something. I had never stopped to consider what a symbol or a sign actually is. Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols. There is no aspect of communication that it doesn't intersect with. Anything that we can imbue with meaning is subject to semiotic investigation. When we talk about Neo representing the common person throwing off the shackles of consumerism, we are talking about semiotics. We are making appeals to concepts that we pack into symbols. The symbol of the chosen one occupies different spaces in different worldviews. It's what allows each of us to interpret a movie so differently. Semiotics is a big subject, but you don't have to devote your life to studying to wrap your head around it. Here are three resources I've used to get acquainted with the topic. - The Media Insider's intro to semiotics is a great place to start, and if it's the only thing you check out on this list, you'll be better off for it. - If you want to see some of these concepts in action, check out Slavoj Zizek's Pervert's Guide to Cinema. This one may not be appropriate for all viewers (CW - He discusses Blue Velvet and SA), but it's an engaging example of applied semiotics. - Daniel Chandler's \"Semiotics: The Basics\" is excellent for those who want to go further. The Best part is it's available as an audio book! Here's a notion page with links to all resources!\n\nüé• The DIY guide to Cinephilia: How to Become a Cinephile in 3 Steps. ‚úçÔ∏è Watch films and write down how you felt about them and the details that meant something to you. Don't worry about publishing; write your reactions and interpretations so you remember them. üó£Ô∏è Talk to friends and compare notes about the movie. Have discussions to see how different the same movie can appear to others. If you can't speak to people, engage with others through film review videos or articles. üìπ Try Making your own films. The goal isn't to become the next Peter Jackson but trying to make a competent video will give you a deeper appreciation for all the roles involved in creating a film. üé¨ A cinephile is just someone passionate about film, film theory, and film criticism. These three activities will help you discover everything you need to watch films like a cinephile.\n\nI know we're supposed to be \"solely professional\" on here, but I cannot stay silent about this. To be clear, I don't subscribe to the kind of blanket statement hot takes I see in contemporary film analysis online, nor will I take preference to only one kind of film genre as \"true\" cinema at the exclusion of all else. I will engage with the nuance of EVERY KIND of story that can be told. To only prefer one genre is to be close-minded, as far as I'm concerned. But the issues facing the industry at present, which I think are perfectly encapsulated by this video from a recently emerging indie filmmaker near the release of his first film, are scary. The close-mindedness AND lack of basic awareness about audience buying trends and interests, among those currently making decisions about which films get made -- and where they get released -- is genuinely terrifying. I won't pretend to be presently capable of articulating such phantasmagorical fears about the industry's future in a clear or concise manner, but at the very least I cannot be silent about it. Because I don't merely want to make movies. I NEED to make movies. It is a literal chronic need. It is as essential to me as oxygen or water. To not be able to do that is equivalent to the feeling of starvation. Every second I am not able to do that, or work towards doing that, is the most physically and mentally painful anguish imaginable. It means that much to me. And seeing every existing available door into that art form close to new filmmakers, and even supposedly \"cemented status\" filmmakers, is terrifying. As absurd as I know it this will sound tomorrow, long after I've already said this, it genuinely makes me question if this art form has a future. Especially when there are already so few stories in it, and even fewer storytellers in it, who look or sound like me. Those are the storytellers being banished the most in this present state of release trends. That cannot continue. Unless EVERY story that is capable of being told gets told, this art form will cease to be a legitimate one."
