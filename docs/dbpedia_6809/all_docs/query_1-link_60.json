        "text": "Renowned Korean filmmaker Lee Chang Dong, the director of Green Fish, Peppermint Candy, and Oasis, returns to the director's chair in 2007 with the critically acclaimed Secret Sunshine. This is his fourth film, and his first directorial work since his stint as Minister of Culture and Tourism from 2003 to 2004. In addition to Lee's long-awaited return, Secret Sunshine attracted much attention with its pairing of two of the biggest names in Korean cinema - Song Kang Ho and Jeon Do Yeon, who was named Best Actress at both the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the 2007 Blue Dragon Film Awards for her amazing performance.\n\nHaving recently lost her husband, piano teacher Shin Ae (Jeon Do Yeon) moves to her husband's hometown of Milyang. Still in a fragile state of grief, she takes solace in her friendship with rough-voiced, but kind-hearted local Jong Chan (Song Kang Ho). In love with Shin Ae, he follows her around and helps her settle into her new home. Life abandons Shin Ae once more though when her son is abducted and murdered. She then takes refuge in religion and, devoting herself to Christianity, slowly begins to heal. To find closure, she visits her child's murderer in prison to tell him she has forgiven him, but what he says in reply throws her into a new crisis.\n\nThis edition comes with aphoto booklet,photo card, and special features (audio commentary, making of, interview, trailer).\n\nJeon Do Yeon\n\nSong Kang Ho\n\nLee Chang Dong\n\nRelease Date:2007-09-21\n\nLanguage:Korean\n\nSubtitles:English, Korean\n\nCountry of Origin:South Korea\n\nPicture Format:NTSC\n\nDisc Format(s):DVD\n\nRegion Code:3 - South East Asia (including Hong Kong, S.
