Garcia\n\nStaff Reporter\n\nActress Jeon Do-yeon waves after winning\n\nthe Best Actress Award at the second Asian Film Awards\n\nin Hong Kong, Monday. / AFP-Yonhap\n\nThe internationally acclaimed Korean film \"Secret Sunshine\" (Miryang) grabbed the spotlight at the second annual Asian Film Awards in Hong Kong, picking up three top awards including Best Film.\n\n\"Secret Sunshine,\" which is about a young widow moving to her late husband's hometown, beat other Asian films such as the controversial thriller \"Lust, Caution,\" Hong Kong's \"The Sun Also Rises\" and Japan's \"I Just Didn't Do It.\"\n\nActress Jeon Do-yeon won Best Actress, adding another award to her collection, which includes several Korean acting awards and the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival last May. She won over Korean actress Kim Yun-jin and Chinese actress Tang Wei.\n\n\"I don't usually need time to recover from most of the roles I portray. But this time, because my character was so damaged, it took some time to recover from it,\" Jeon was quoted by the Associated Press, after winning the award.\n\nThe film's director Lee Chang-dong was named best director, besting Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee, who was nominated for \"Lust, Caution.\"\n\nHong Kong actor Tony Leung Chiu-wai won the best actor award for his role as a collaborator in \"Lust, Caution.\" He bested Korean actor Song Kang-ho, who was nominated for his role in \"Secret Sunshine,\" as well as Chinese action star Jet Li and Japanese actors Joe Odagiri and Ryo Kase.\n\nBest supporting actress award was given to Chinese-American actress Joan Chen for \"The Sun Also Rises,\" while the best supporting actor award went to Sun Honglei for \"Mongol.\"\n\nThere were several Koreans nominated in various categories at the Asian Film Awards.

Garcia\n\nStaff Reporter\n\nA visitor pays his respect to the late Korean novelist Lee Cheong-jun,\n\nwho died Thursday, at the Samsung Medical Center, southern Seoul.\n\nLee wrote many famous novels and stories including “Seopyeonje” and\n\n“Dangsindeului Cheon.” / Yonhap\n\nKorean master novelist Lee Cheong-jun, known for \"Sopyonje\" and \"Dangsindeului Cheonkuk\" (Your Heaven),'' died Thursday, after losing his battle with lung cancer. He was 68 years old.\n\nYonhap News reported Lee had been undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer last year. His illness worsened, and he was transferred to the Samsung Medical Center in Ilwon, southern Seoul for further treatment.\n\nLee was born August 1939 in Jangheung, South Jeolla Province. In 1965, his short story 'Toewon\" won the Sasanggye New Writer Prize. Two years later, he won a Dongin Literature Award for \"Stupid and Fool\" (Byeongsingwa Meojeori).\n\nThroughout his four decade-long career, Lee wrote more than 100 short stories, 13 novels.\n\nLee's work has influenced a generation of Korean writers and helped improve the overall quality of Korean literature. He has won some of Korean literature's top awards, including the Yi Sang Literature Award, Republic of Korea Literature Award, Hankook Ilbo's Creative Literature award, and recently, the Ho-Am Arts Prize.\n\nLee wrote several short novels about the traditional Korean musical art, pansori, such as \"Sonpyonje,\" \"The Light of Pansori\" and \"The Wanderer of Seonhak-dong.\"\n\n\"Sopyonje\" is about a traditional pansori master who travels the country with his adopted son and daughter. Director Im Kwon-taek adapted his novel into a film of the same title in 1993. It was the first Korean film to attract one million viewers in Seoul, and it also garnered acclaim from critics in Korea and abroad.\n\nLee's novel \"The Wanderer of Seonghak-dong,\" was again the basis of another movie by Im, \"Thousand Year Crane,\" released last year.\n\nAnother short story \"A Story of a Worm,\" provided the plot for the acclaimed film \"Secret Sunshine,\" directed by Lee Chang-dong and starred Jeon Do-yeon, who won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress award for the role.\n\nMany of his novels and short stories have been translated and published in the United States, Japan, China, France, Germany, Spain and Turkey.\n\nDespite being sick, he published a new fiction novel last year. He also published a collection of short stories last November.\n\nLee is survived by his wife and a daughter. His body is at the Samsung Medical Center mortuary, Room 14.

Director Lee Yoon-ki, the melodrama craftsman of critically acclaimed works like \"This Charming Girl\" (2006), brings what he calls an unconventional, post-breakup love story.\n\nJeon appears as Heui-su, an uptight, unemployed single woman in her mid-30s. Broke and desperate, she suddenly recalls that her ex-boyfriend Byeong-u, owes her 3.5 million won (about $3,500). She finds him gambling at a horseracing track and demands reimbursement. Reunited after one year, the two spend \"one fine day\" (the Korean title of the film) together, with Heui-su driving Byeong-u to one lady friend after another to borrow money.\n\nAbout her post-Cannes appearance, Jeon admitted feeling pressured but denied rumors that she was offered innumerable opportunities here and abroad. \"I was speaking with (\"Secret Sunshine\" co-star) Song Kang-ho about how it's hard enough to act in Korean, let alone a foreign language,'' she said. \"I chose the script because it was well written, and I adore love stories. But this is an unconventional romance and gives off a unique color.\"\n\nUnlike the dramatic emotional tension that mark both of the stars' previous works, \"My Dear Enemy\" takes place over one rather uneventful day, and subtle emotions and chemistry between the actors propel the narrative.\n\nAbout working opposite the reputed actress, Ha said Jeon quieted his nervousness with her easy manner. The two had actually appeared together three years ago in the hit drama \"Lovers of Prague,\" where Ha played a supporting role as the heroine's bodyguard.\n\n\"I can't believe that I have risen to play opposite Jeon in such a short time frame,\" he said. \"While playing her bodyguard in the drama, there were many scenes where I was chauffeuring for her. I remember one particular scene where she was crying, and I was so moved I almost shed tears. Jeon is a great actress who inspires those around her even before the audience.\" He joked about being rather disappointed there was no love scene.\n\nJeon said that she was the one who was grateful in the partnership. \"I didn't know we'd be cast together because of our age difference, but Jung-woo was able to come far because he was already a good actor back then,\" she said. Jeon, 35, looked younger than ever in her smoky eye makeup. The film clips showed how she looked even more youthful than Ha, who is five years her junior. Her secret to looking more beautiful by the day? \"It's inborn. Just kidding. It's the make-up,\" she said with a grin.\n\nShe continued, \"Jung-woo is a very versatile actor and really supported me.\" Ha, complimented by Martin Scorsese as having as much potential as Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon, has a knack for pulling off colorful characters, from a psychopathic serial killer to a suave bar host in \"The Moonlight of Seoul.\" When asked if the latter character, a playboy who swindles women, might be a repetition for his upcoming film, he said, no.\n\n\"While it's true that both characters are very sleazy, 'The Moonlight of Seoul' is a bitter, dark night story while my character in 'My Dear Enemy,' energized by the sun, is cheerful and optimistic despite his recklessness,\" he said.\n\n\"My Dear Enemy\" is slated for release Sept. 25. Distributed by Lotte Entertainment.\n\nCredits: hyowlee@koreatimes.co.kr\n\nhttp://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2.../135_30073.html\n\nSeptember 21, 2008\n\nJeon Do-yeon on Pregnancy, Post-Cannes Film\n\nBy Lee Hyo-won\n\nStaff Reporter\n\nActress Jeon Do-yeon talks about her new film \"My Dear Enemy\" and her post-Cannes life\n\nwith The Korea Times in a private press meeting / Courtesy of Film Bom\n\nActress Jeon Do-yeon seems to have it all, having won the Best Actress award at Cannes last year and about to enter motherhood. In time for the release of her latest movie \"My Dear Enemy,\" the 35-year-old, five months pregnant but looking svelte in a colorful construction dress, met with The Korea Times in a private press meeting Friday.\n\n\"I'm super healthy, I actually wish I had morning sickness,\" joked Jeon, who is expected to deliver her first child at the end of January. The actress rose to international prominence for her role in \"Secret Sunshine\" as a woman traumatized by her son's death. \"I was afraid I was portraying a stereotypical mother figure in 'Secret Sunshine,' but the director (Lee Chang-dong) assured me that my interpretation is probably right. If I were to tackle the role again after having my own child, it would probably be different,\" she said.\n\n\"'Secret Sunshine' was challenging because the director left everything completely up to me, and I felt cornered. When I'd tell him I didn't know how to interpret something, he would say he didn't know either,\" she said. She said she simply wanted to rest after wrapping up the emotionally draining film.\n\nThe torment paid off with the much coveted prize at Cannes. But the \"Queen of Cannes\" felt like a nobody at the festival. \"No one knew me, nor had any information about me even after watching 'Secret Sunshine.' Seeing all these cineastes and actors I grew up watching was greatly inspiring but it also affected my self-esteem. It made me realize that there is a lot I still need to achieve in the future,'' she said. Following the international spotlight, the actress did receive a few offers for artistic foreign films and was invited to film festivals around Asia. She was also interviewed by CNN.\n\nAbout possible a foreign film debut, however, she said it would be unlikely to happen in the near future. \"First, the language barrier is there. I'm an actor who always thought dialogue wasn't very important, because people don't speak perfectly in real life. But if I were to deliver lines in a foreign tongue, or if my lines were to be dubbed, it's doubtful whether or not it would be natural. (Making a foreign film debut) would be more rooted in ambition than genuine passion,\" she said.\"But I would like to learn English so I can converse with (non-Korean) actors and cineastes,\" she said.\n\n\"My nickname (Queen of Cannes) is the only thing that changed,\" she said about her post-Cannes life in Korea. Jeon expressed concern about the dwindling domestic film market. \"I do get maybe one or two more scripts than I normally would, but with the number of films being produced cut to half, I think all the other actresses are struggling as well,\" she said.\n\nThe Cannes title was a big burden for her, but she chose \"My Dear Enemy\" for its amusing story about a single unemployed woman in her 30s spending an awkward day with her ex-boyfriend. \"I was really scared because I felt overrated (for 'Secret Sunshine'). But my heart feels a lot less heavy now because ('My Dear Enemy') turned out well,\" she said. \"My husband thought I was being myself,\" she said about her stubborn, ill-tempered character. \"You might laugh, but I'm actually quite winsome and charming,\" she protested.\n\nJeon has starred opposite some of the most reputable South Korean actors. She made her big screen debut in 1997 in \"The Contact\" with \"Shiri (Swiri)\" star Han Seok-gyu, followed by works including \"Happy End\" opposite \"Old Boy\" hero Choi Min-sik; \"Untold Scandal\" with hallyu superstar Bae Yong-joon; and \"Secret Sushine\" with \"The Host\" leading man Song Kang-ho. She appears in her latest movie with Korea's rising star Ha Jung-woo (\"The Chaser\").\n\n\"If Song Kang-ho is like a preying beast, Ha Jung-woo is like a bunny who can swindle someone's liver,\" she said, comparing Ha to the Korean folk tale bunny that can talk a king into selling his liver. \"He's a very versatile actor,\" she complimented Ha. Looking back at her acting career, she said \"The Contact\" was unforgettable because it was her first movie, and \"Happy End\" helped define herself as an actress while \"Secret Sunshine\" made her break herself down.\n\nAbout taking a break from acting for the baby, she said getting roles might become more difficult. \"I think things will get tougher. I have no idea,\" she said. \"Now that I'm about to have a baby, I realize that mothers aren't made to be mothers,\" she said, explaining that one does not necessarily have to be perfectly prepared to become a parent. But one thing she's sure about is that she wants to become a trusting parent who can have complete faith in her child.\n\nBut trust is perhaps key to everything, including movies, like director Lee Chang-dong's utter faith in Jeon for her award-winning role, as well as Lee Yoon-ki's confidence in the screen beauty for her charismatic performance in \"My Dear Enemy.\"\n\n\"My Dear Enemy'' is due in theaters Thursday. Spongehouse is hosting a Jeon Do-yeon retrospective through Oct. 1 featuring some 10 films. Spongehouse Gwanghwamun is located near exit 6 of Gwanghwamun Station on subway line 5. Call (02) 2285-2095.\n\nCredits: hyowlee@koreatimes.co.kr\n\nhttp://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2.../141_31350.html\n\nSeptember 22, 2008\n\nQueen of Cannes' Is Back With Lighter Fare\n\nActress Jeon Do-yeon\n\nThe Queen of Cannes is back. Jeon Do-yeon seemed somewhat overwhelmed by the title, given to her after her winning the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 for her role in “Secret Sunshine,” but she knew she would have to get used to it. The Chosun Ilbo met her for an interview at a café in Apgujeong-dong on Friday afternoon. “This won’t go away until someone else gets the Best Actress award, right? I want to break people’s preconception that I peaked at ‘Secret Sunshine,’” she says.\n\nJeon is back on the screen with “My Dear Enemy” directed by Lee Yoon-ki, which is to be released this Thursday. She stars as Hee-su, an unmarried woman who goes to her ex-boyfriend a year after their breakup to collect W3.5 million that she had lent him. It is a much lighter, and perhaps duller, character compared to the dramatic Shin-ae in “Secret Sunshine,” a mother whose child was abducted and found dead. “Because the role of Shin-ae was so difficult, I wanted to do something more relaxing and comfortable after ‘Secret Sunshine.’ But it wasn’t as easy as I thought,” Jeon says.\n\nShe calls “My Dear Enemy” a romantic film that is different from the average melodrama, where everyone knows how it will end. “I was drawn to Hee-su because she and I have a lot in common,” Jeon says. “She looks as if she often tends to step out of line, but in fact she battles every day to survive.”\n\nJeon is expecting a baby in January next year, and she seems excited. “I thought a mother is a perfect and impeccable being to everyone, but after I got pregnant, I realized that I wasn’t ready to be a perfect person for anyone,” she admits. But she soon brightens. “I heard daughters are the capital of a family, and it is also fun to see sons growing into young men.”\n\nThere is more good news for Jeon fans. From Thursday last week until Oct.1, a retrospective devoted to her is being held in the Gwanghwamun and Apgujeong branches of the Sponge House. It’s a small film festival consisting of Jeon’s entire filmography of 10 films, such as “The Contact (1997),” “Happy End (1999),” “Untold Scandal (2003),” “You Are my Sunshine (2005)” and “Secret Sunshine (2007).”\n\nA film festival homage to a 30-something active actress is an extremely rare thing. “At first, I consented to the idea without giving it much thought. I just said yes out of curiosity and for the fun it might bring. But afterwards, I felt a lot of pressure,” Jeon says. “But these films are like my children, and they compare quite well with any other films. So while I feel the pressure, I also feel confident and proud.”\n\nSource: english.chosun.com\n\nhttp://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/new...0809220014.html"
