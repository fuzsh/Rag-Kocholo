        "text": "CANNES â€” It is difficult to picture Lee Chang Dong, the director of \"Secret Sunshine,\" going up the red carpet. Lee, who was minister of culture in Korea, is a shy person and surely the most discreet director at this festival.\n\nHis film, which is in competition, looks quiet too. \"Secret Sunshine\" opens on a fable: a gentle young widow, a piano teacher, goes to a small town with her child. It is her husband's hometown, and the early signs are promising: people seem welcoming, the pharmacist smiles at her, and her small son adapts to his new school.\n\nShe also meets a car mechanic - a lumbering awkward man - who trails her, faithful-dog style.\n\nBut things are not as they seem and her life takes a tragic turn.\n\n\"Secret Sunshine\" is mysterious and terrifying. At times, it feels like a thriller, with surprising twists, but it has a hidden core. It is a story of faith, how it can enter a life, and how it can vanish.\n\n\"I adapted the story from a novella,\" the director said in an interview. \"It was called the 'Story of Insects,' by Lee Chung Joon; I read it in the 1980s. It stayed with me.\"\n\nThe director, 53, speaks in a whisper, which makes conversation tricky, especially at a lunch table - there's no such thing as a quiet one at Cannes - and with an interpreter in the middle.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
