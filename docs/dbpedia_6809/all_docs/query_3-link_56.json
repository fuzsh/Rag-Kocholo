Developed a few years after his stint as the national minister of arts and culture, Secret Sunshine is a blisteringly intense observation of grief, and religion, relating to the phenomena of evangelical christianity sweeping South Korea.\n\nThis poignant odyssey into forgiveness focuses on Lee Shin-ae (Jeon Do-yeon), a widow in her thirties who decides to set up a piano academy in her late husband’s hometown, Miryang (Korean for secret sunshine) as an attempt to restart her life. She soon befriends a friendly and naive car mechanic, Kim Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho) who helps her out in this new place. Soon, another unthinkable tragedy threatens to overturn her life and her desperate quest for reconciliation.\n\nSecret Sunshine is part of the film programme Retrospective: Lee Chang Dong.
