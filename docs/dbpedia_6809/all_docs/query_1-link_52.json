We are introduced to someone that misses her deceased husband but has passed the stage of agony, only for it to come back when another death comes her way, in a truly tragic way. And we bear witness to the process. Grief. Raw, ugly grief that comes in all different ways. Mostly ways in which were uncomfortable to watch, physically harmful for those involved and, occasionally, amusing in its own sort of way (specifically due to the irony of the situation). Alongside her is the cheerful and helpful Kim Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), acting as the good samaritan. He, too, goes through some changes of his own. His intentions are very self centred but he too finds peace in God, more so than Shin-ae could, despite her best attempts and in the end chooses to be the good guy and not take advantage of a deeply depressed, grieving mother. There isn’t a lot of joy in Secret Sunshine. There is an endless wave of hurt and visceral emotion, the kind that gets stuck in your throat and you’re in pain at the mere thought of. But there is some solace in the ending. Because despite everything, there is light at the end of the tunnel. No matter how you interpret something as simple as the rays of sunshine.\n\nRead More\n\nWas this review helpful to you?"
