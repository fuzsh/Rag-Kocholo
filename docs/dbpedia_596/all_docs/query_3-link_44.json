        "text": "As German industry focused on mechanization and the synthetic manufacturing of fuel and rubber, the German General Staff engaged in a series of war games and planning scenarios. These were not only designed to stimulate the intellect, but also to field test emerging theory and doctrine. The author of this study recognizes that these exercises were important to the development of maneuver warfare, but that they were not generally debated. Still, several key factors of operational level planning significance are germane to this monograph. Of particular interest were the planning against Poland in the late 1920s, the maneuvers of 1928-1929, and the Fünkubung (radio exercise) of 1932. These three exercises began to address what might be construed as the operational level of war and to define the conduct of future operations. The late 1920s saw the beginning of realistic operational planning against Poland. The Truppenamt (which later became the General Staff) envisioned three operational objectives for the war planners: Gdynia’s port facilities, the seaplane stations at Puck and Rewa, and Gdynia’s costal defense batteries. Initially planned as an all-army operation, intelligence reports determined that a marine company, a battery of coastal artillery, and a railroad battery had recently been deployed in and around the port of Gdynia. The army simply did not have enough time to get to Gdynia without encountering significant Polish resistance, and without losing valuable time that would allow the preparation and occupation of defensive positions. This dilemma was the genesis of Studie Gdingen (Study Gdynia). Operational planning was quickly turned over to the navy for further study. Studie Gdingen eventually contained four distinct phases: shelling the port; clearing mines; landing troops; and destruction of the port. A light task force of cruisers and fast-attack vessels would deploy within hours of a ground invasion with three missions: locate harbor mines; prevent the Polish navy from exiting the port; and act as a covering force until the heavy task force arrived 24 hours later. The heavy task force, comprised of heavy-ships, would shell neighboring airfields and defensive batteries in preparation for an amphibious assault. Infantry landing vessels behind minesweepers would enter and destroy the port. In summary, the navy utilized blitzkrieg-associated concepts substituting cruisers for tanks and battle ships for artillery and utilizing infantry to destroy strong points."
