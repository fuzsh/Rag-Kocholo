Leaders should have certain skills and abilities in order to manage catastrophes based on the environmental conditions, organizations they lead, scope of the disaster. This study provides an overview of the leadership competencies and traits that are necessary for disaster management. A conceptual framework for leadership was provided throughout the research.\n\nEmergency management and resilience are key concepts and functions that are vital for mitigating risks of hazards and reducing the impacts of disasters. Public sector leaders within the emergency management and resilience domains play a critical role in leading the organization and its staff and partners in achieving these goals of risk mitigation and disaster impact reduction. This research investigates the skills and competencies that emergency management and resilience leaders need to be successful in collaborations to deal with emergencies and disasters today and in a post-COVID world. The study will employ a postpositivist case study design using interviews as an instrument to gain deep understanding of the important skillset and competencies identified by emergency management and resilience professionals. The study samples a target population of emergency management leaders and resilience professionals from the Mid-Atlantic region through snowball sampling. The sample will inc...\n\nThis qualitative grounded theory designed study identified perceptions and interpretations of leaders and leadership from the perspective of mid-level fire and emergency services officers. The findings from this study discovered a possible pathway for instilling the philosophy of servant leadership into the fire and emergency services. The study took place at a large metropolitan fire and emergency services agency in the Western United States. The 15 participants in the study were affiliated, uniformed and sworn, mid-level fire and emergency services officers. The literature used to form this study, identified negative issues associated with current leadership practices within the fire and emergency services and their relations to both the physical and mental stresses that many responders suffer. The study’s theoretical finding was mid-level fire and emergency service officers interpreted the role of a leader to be that of serving their followers. The theoretical finding seemingly a..."
