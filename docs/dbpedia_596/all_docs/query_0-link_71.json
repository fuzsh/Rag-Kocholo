        "text": "Mammalian and avian embryology at Warsaw University (Poland) from XIX century to the present.\n\nPubMed\n\nTarkowski, Andrzej K; Maleszewski, Marek; Rogulska, Teresa; Ciemerych, Maria A; Borsuk, Ewa\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn this article, we describe the history (between the XIX century and World War II) of embryological research conducted at Warsaw University, together with current research activities being carried out at the Department of Embryology. During the partition of Poland, the Imperial (Russian) Warsaw University conducted research on avian embryology (and to a smaller extent, on reptilian embryology). When Poland regained independence in 1918, these studies were continued under the Chair of Comparative Anatomy headed by Professor Jan Tur. A new Department of Embryology created in 1954 was first headed by Professor Stanislaw Bilewicz and since 1964 by Professor Andrzej Tarkowski, who in 2003 was succeeded by Dr. Marek Maleszewski D.Sc. During the last 45 years, embryological research at Warsaw University has concentrated mainly on mammalian development with special emphasis on the regulative capabilities of early embryos and also on experimental chimaeras, nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions in oogenesis and early embryogenesis (including regulation of DNA replication and transcription), experimental parthenogenesis and fertilization.\n\nTemporal variations in optical and microphysical properties of mineral dust and biomass burning aerosol derived from daytime Raman lidar observations over Warsaw, Poland\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJanicka, Lucja; Stachlewska, Iwona S.; Veselovskii, Igor; Baars, Holger\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn July 2013, favorable weather conditions caused a severe events of advection of biomass burning particles of Canadian forest fires to Europe. The smoke layers were widely observed, especially in Western Europe. An unusual atmospheric aerosol composition was measured at the EARLINET site in Warsaw, Central Poland, during a short event that occurred between 11 and 21 UTC on 10th July 2013. Additionally to the smoke layer, mineral dust was detected in a separate layer. The long-range dust transport pathway followed an uncommon way; originating in Western Sahara, passing above middle Atlantic, and circulating over British Islands, prior to its arrival to Poland. An effective radius of 560 nm was obtained for Saharan dust over Warsaw. This relatively small effective radius is likely due to the long time of the transport. The aerosol-polarization-Raman PollyXT-UW lidar was used for a successful daytime Raman retrieval of the aerosol optical properties at selected times during this short event. The aerosol vertical structure during the inflow over Warsaw in terms of optical properties and depolarization was analyzed, indicating clear distinction of the layers. The microphysical properties were inverted from the lidar derived optical data for selected ranges as representing the smoke and the mineral dust. For smoke, the effective radius was in the range of 0.29-0.36 Î¼m and the complex refractive index 1.36 + 0.008i, on average. For dust, the values of 0.33-0.56 Î¼m and 1.56 + 0.004i were obtained. An evolution of the aerosol composition over Warsaw during the day was analyzed.\n\nLidar derived properties of air-masses advected from Ukraine, Sahara and Carpathian mountains to Warsaw, Poland on 9 - 11 August 2015\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJanicka, Lucja; Szczepanik, Dominika; Borek, Karolina; Heese, Birgit; Stachlewska, Iwona S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe aerosol layers of different origin, suspended in the atmosphere on 9-11 August 2015 were observed with the PollyXT-UW lidar in Warsaw, Poland. The HYSPLIT ensemble backward trajectories indicate that the observed air-masses attribute to a few different sources, among others, possible transport paths from Ukraine, Slovakia, and Africa. In this paper, we attempt to analyse and discuss the properties of aerosol particles of different origin that were suspended over Warsaw during this event.\n\n10th Annual Symposium on Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose, April 27â29, 2017, Warsaw, Poland\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHomberg, Anita; Hinzmann, Rolf\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAbstract International experts in the field of diabetes and diabetes technology met in Warsaw, Poland, for the 10th Annual Symposium on Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose. The goal of these meetings is to establish a global network of experts to facilitate new collaborations and research projects that can improve the lives of people with diabetes. The 2017 meeting comprised a comprehensive scientific program, parallel interactive workshops, and four keynote lectures.

The genesis of this situation dates back to the period of the national bondage by the Russian partitioner, and since 1915 by the German invader who did not care about the problems associated with public health. The sanitary and hygienic conditions worsened significantly in 1916, after incorporating into Warsaw large out-of-town regions whose housing was of the rural character with numerous wooden cottages, field roads, without any sanitary sewage system. Poor municipal sanitary-maintenance conditions and infectious diseases spreading in Warsaw made the Town Authorities implement preventive action and entrust sanitary surveillances with this difficult task. These surveillances were set up at the time of the First World War, and after 1920 were changed into sanitary offices. Their duties included control of acute infectious diseases, sanitary inspection of living quarters, sites of production and selling of food articles, plants, service outlets, shops of a different character, as well as surveillance of food purchased by the inhabitants. In each sanitary office a doctor was employed who supervised the work of one, two or three sanitary inspectors.\n\nPLASMA-2013: International Conference on Research and Applications of Plasmas (Warsaw, Poland, 2-6 September 2013)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSadowski, Marek J.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe PLASMA-2013 International Conference on Research and Applications of Plasmas was held in Warsaw (Poland) from 2 to 6 September 2013. The conference was organized by the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion, under the auspices of the Polish Physical Society. The scope of the PLASMA conferences, which have been organized every two years since 1993, covers almost all issues of plasma physics and fusion research as well as selected problems of plasma technology. The PLASMA-2013 conference topics included: â¢Elementary processes and general plasma physics. â¢Plasmas in tokamaks and stellarators (magnetic confinement fusion). â¢Plasmas generated by laser beams and inertial confinement fusion. â¢Plasmas produced by Z-pinch and plasma-focus discharges. â¢Low-temperature plasma physics. â¢Space plasmas and laboratory astrophysics. â¢Plasma diagnostic methods and applications of plasmas. This conference was designed not only for plasma researchers and engineers, but also for students from all over the world, in particular for those from Central and Eastern Europe. Almost 140 participants had the opportunity to hear 9 general lectures, 11 topical talks and 26 oral presentations, as well as to see and discuss around 120 posters. From about 140 contributions, after the preparation of about 100 papers and the peer review process, only 74 papers have been accepted for publication in this topical issue. Acknowledgments Acting on behalf of the International Scientific Committee I would like to express our thanks to all the invited speakers and all the participants of the PLASMA-2013 conference for their numerous contributions. In particular, I wish to thank all of the authors of papers submitted for publication in this topical issue of Physica Scripta . Particular thanks are due to all of the reviewers for their valuable reports and comments, which helped to improve the quality of many of the papers.

During the study the highest contamination was near the Warszawa Steel Mill, northwestern Warsaw. Lead concentrations in moss bags decreased in time, while those of Cd and Zn did not show clear trends. Between 1994 and 2004, Pb, Cd, and Zn were also monitored in the Crimean linden (Tilia Euchlora) foliage along the main city avenue and in a northwestern warsaw park. Lead concentrations decreased more near the avenue than in the park, indicating that the phasing-out of leaded gasoline had a major effect on reduced Pb contamination in Warsaw. At the same time, foliar concentrations of Cd and Zn in both areas decreased much less.\n\nU.S./Poland Cooperative Telemedicine Program\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2006-06-01\n\nVitel Net) and the Military Institute of Health Service ( MIHS ) worked together with the goal of improving health care for Polish military personnel.

The quantification of the health risks and benefits arising from these factors would provide useful information for the planning of cost-effective mitigation actions. In this study we quantified the burden of disease caused by local transport in the city of Warsaw, Poland. The disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated for transport related air pollution (particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), cadmium, lead and nickel), noise, injuries and physical activity. Exposure to these factors was based on local and international data, and the exposure-response functions (ERFs) were based on published reviews and recommendations. The uncertainties were quantified and propagated with the Monte Carlo method. Local transport generated air pollution, noise and injuries were estimated to cause approximately 58,000 DALYs in the study area. From this burden 44% was due to air pollution and 46% due to noise. Transport related physical activity was estimated to cause a health benefit of 17,000 DALYs. Main quantified uncertainties were related to disability weight for the annoyance (due to noise) and to the ERFs for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and walking. The results indicate that the health burden of transport could be mitigated by reducing motorized transport, which causes air pollution and noise, and by encouraging walking and cycling in the study area.

Over the first 3-month period eight Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were identified as being resistant to ceftazidime. Six of these were found to produce the TEM-47 ESBL, which we first described in a K. pneumoniae strain recovered a year before in a pediatric hospital in ÅÃ³dÅº, Poland, which is 140 km from Warsaw. Typing results revealed a very close relatedness among all these isolates, which suggested that the clonal outbreak in Warsaw was caused by a strain possibly imported from ÅÃ³dÅº. The remaining two isolates expressed the SHV-5-like ESBL, which resulted from the horizontal transfer of a plasmid carrying the blaSHV gene between nonrelated strains. The data presented here exemplify the complexity of the epidemiological situation concerning ESBL producers typical for large Polish hospitals, in which no ESBL-monitoring programs were in place prior to 1995.

One of the main tasks of the ESO Science Outreach Network (ESON) is translation of various materials at ESO website, as well as contacts with journalists. We support also science festivals, conferences, contests, exhibitions, astronomy camps and workshops and other educational and outreach activities. During 2011-2013 we supported events like ESO Astronomy Camp 2013, ESO Industry Days in Warsaw, Warsaw Science Festival, Torun Festival of Science and Art, international astronomy olympiad held in Poland and many others. Among big tasks there was also translation of over 60 ESOcast movies.\n\nOccurrence of antidepressant residues in the sewage-impacted Vistula and Utrata rivers and in tap water in Warsaw (Poland).\n\nPubMed\n\nGiebuÅtowicz, Joanna; NaÅÄcz-Jawecki, Grzegorz\n\n2014-06-01\n\nAntidepressants, even at low concentrations, can reveal some adverse effects on aquatic life due to disturbing homeostasis throughout the central and peripheral nervous system both in vertebrates and invertebrates. To date there have not been any reports regarding the presence of these pharmaceuticals in surface and tap waters in Eastern Europe. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the presence of 21 antidepressant pharmaceuticals at specific points of the main Polish river - the Vistula, a smaller river of the Warsaw region - the Utrata, as well as in tap water samples of Warsaw. Samples were collected twice at one month intervals and analysed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique coupled with the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) method operated under the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). This is the first study where active compounds such as moclobemid or trazodone in the environment have been investigated. Environmental risk assessment of antidepressants in Poland was estimated on the basis of annuals sale data extracted from the NFZ (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia-National Health Service) base of reimbursed pharmaceuticals(1). Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of target pharmaceuticals were compared with their measured concentration (MEC). Moreover, the application of the EMEA/CHMP guideline for environmental risk assessment of the antidepressants was discussed. The highest concentration of antidepressants was observed in the small river Utrata. In tap water only trace amounts of antidepressants including citalopram (up to 1.5ng/l), mianserin (up to 0.9ng/l), sertraline (<3.1ng/l), moclobemid (up to 0.3ng/l) and venlafaxine (up to 1.9ng/l) were detected. However this highlights their inadequate elimination in the drinking waste treatment facility. The presence of antidepressants in drinking water and the aquatic environment could have long-term effects even at low exposure level\n\nBe Healthy as a Fish Educational Program at the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw, Poland\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSzymaÅska, Ewelina; BiaÅek-Wyrzykowska, Urszula; Wiweger, MaÅgorzata; KuÅºnicki, Jacek\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract The purpose of the Be Healthy as a Fish educational program that is organized by the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IIMCB) in Warsaw, Poland, is to educate children about the ways in which zebrafish can be used as a model organism to help scientists understand the way the human body works. We introduce Be Healthy as a Fish workshops to children in fourth to sixth grades of primary school (9â11 years old), together with two kinds of materials under the same title: a book and a movie. We focus on the field of biology in a way that complements the children's classroom curriculum and encourages them to broaden their interests in biology in the future. The Be Healthy as a Fish educational program was inaugurated in 2014 at the Warsaw Science Festival. As of October 31, 2015, 526 primary school students participated in 27 workshops. Approximately 2000 people have received the book and nearly 1700 people have watched the movie. Be Healthy as a Fish: Origin of the Title There is a popular saying in Poland that someone is âhealthy as a fishâ meaning that one enjoys good health. Does this imply that fish are really that healthy? Obviously, some fish may not be healthy. Just like other animals and humans, they can and do get sick. However, this common and deceptive impression of âhealthy fishâ results from the fact that people hardly ever have an opportunity to observe a fish that is sick. Why does our educational program have such a possibly misleading title that may not always be true? We took advantage of this provocative title and commonly known expression and assigned to it a completely new meaning: fish can get sick, but they are important for human health. Notably, this catchy sentence intrinsically combines two keywordsâhealth and fishâwhich, in our opinion, makes it a good title for a successful educational program.

In this study, we quantify the health burden due to local air pollution for Warsaw, Poland. The health impact of the main air pollutants, PM, NOX, SO2, CO, C6H6, BaP and heavy metals is considered. The annual mean concentrations are predicted with the CALPUFF air quality modeling system using the year 2012 emission and meteorological data. The emission field comprises point, mobile and area sources. The exposure to these pollutants was estimated using population data with a spatial resolution of 0.5 Ã 0.5 km2. Changes in mortality and in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated with relative risk functions obtained from literature. It has been predicted that local emissions cause approximately 1600 attributable deaths and 29,000 DALYs per year. About 80% of the health burden was due to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Mobile and area sources contributed 46% and 52% of total DALYs, respectively. When the inflow from outside was included, the burden nearly doubled to 51,000 DALYs. These results indicate that local decisions can potentially reduce associated negative health effects, but a national-level policy is required for reducing the strong environmental impact of PM emissions.

Their bodies were buried secretly, and most places are still unknown. The research presents the results of identification of people buried in one of many mass graves, which were found at the cemetery PowÄ zki Military in Warsaw, Poland. Exhumation revealed the remains of eight people, among which seven were identified genetically. Well-preserved molars were used for the study. Reference material was collected from the closest living relatives. In one case, an exhumation of victim's parents had to be performed. DNA from swabs was extracted with a PrepFiler Â® BTA Forensic DNA Extraction Kit and organic method. Autosomal, Y-STR amplification, and mtDNA sequencing were performed. The biostatistical calculations resulted in LR values from 1608 to 928 Ã 10 18 . So far, remains of more than 50 victims were identified.

About 2 500-3 000 cases of meningitis and/or encephalitis of viral or bacterial etiology are recorded in Poland every year. Assessment of the epidemiological situation of meningitis and/or encephalitis in Poland in 2012, was based on the results of analysis of epidemiological reports sent to the NIZP-PZH by the Regional Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations published in the annual bulletin \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012\" and \"Preventive immunizations in Poland in 2012\" (Czarkowski MP. et al., Warsaw, 2013, NIZP-PZH, GIS). In 2012 in Poland 3 088 cases of meningitis and/or encephalitis were recorded. More than 50% of these were viral infections. The epidemiological situation of inflammatory meningitis and encephalitis in Poland in 2012 compared to 2011 did not change significantly.\n\nTeaching Democracy in East Central Europe: The Case of Poland.

The objective of this study was to analyze the attitude of nursing students at the Medical University of Warsaw in the center of Poland toward organ donation and determine the factors that affect this attitude. The study was conducted in the 2011 to 2012 academic year. The study population consisted of nursing students. Type of sampling consisted of sampling in points of compulsory attendance, in the 5 nursing courses with the higher degree of fulfillment of 80%. Measuring instrument used was the validated questionnaire (PCID-DTO Rios). The questionnaire was completed anonymously and was self-administered. The completion rate was 96% (793 of 828). Of the students surveyed (nÂ = 793), 69% (nÂ = 547) were in favor of organ donation and transplantation, 25% (nÂ = 201) were undecided, and 6% (nÂ = 45) were against. This attitude was related to being in favor of donating the organs of a relative (ORÂ = 3.174; PÂ < .001); discussion of the subject with the family (ORÂ = 2.188; PÂ < .001); positive attitude toward donation and transplantation of the father (ORÂ = 3.039; PÂ = .001); considered to having good information on the subject (ORÂ = 8.695; PÂ < .001); being a regular donor blood (ORÂ = 3.597; PÂ = .001); not worried by the possible mutilation of the body after donation (ORÂ = 6.802; PÂ < .001); and accepting other treatment options of the body such as the burial (ORÂ = 1.683; PÂ = .015). More than 30% of the nursing students are not in favor of organ donation, but this attitude is conditioned by several psychosocial factors. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The phenotypic tests recommended by EUCAST for the detection of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are not always suited for P. aeruginosa strains. This is mainly due to the presence of other families of ESBLs in P. aeruginosa isolates more often than in Enterobacteriaceae, production of natural AmpC cephalosporinase and its overexpression, and co-production of metallo-Î²-lactamases. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of ESBLs in P. aeruginosa isolated from patients from hospitals in Warsaw, to evaluate the ESBL production of these isolates using currently available phenotypic tests, their modifications, multiplex PCR and molecular typing of ESBL-positive isolates by PFGE. Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were collected in 2000-2014 from four Warsaw hospitals. Based on the data obtained in this study, we suggest using three DDST methods with inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam and imipenem, to detect ESBL-producing P. aeruginosa strains. Depending on the appearance of the plates, we suggest a reduction in the distance between discs with antibiotics to 15 mm and the addition of boronic acid at 0.4 mg per disc. The analysed isolates carried genes encoding ESBL from the families VEB (69 isolates with VEB-9), GES (6 with GES-1, 1 GES-5, 5 GES-13 and 2 with GES-15), OXA-2 (12 with OXA-15, 1 OXA-141, 1 OXA-210, 1 OXA-543 and 1 with OXA-544) and OXA-10 (5 isolates with OXA-74 and one with OXA-142). The most important result of this study was the discovery of three new genes, blaGES-15, blaOXA-141 and blaOXA-142; their nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the NCBI GenBank. It is also very important to note that this is the first report on the epidemiological problem of VEB-9-producing bacterial strains, not only in Poland but also worldwide.

The present study focuses on differences between erythemal and UVA (324 nm) doses measured by the Brewer spectrophotometers in Warsaw (52.3Â° N, 21.0Â° E) and Belsk (51.8Â° N, 20.8Â° E). The latter is a rural region located about 60 km south-west of the city. Ratios between erythemal and UVA partly daily doses, obtained during all-sky and cloudless-sky conditions for the period May 2013-December 2015, were analysed to infer a specific cloud and aerosol forcing on the surface UV doses over Warsaw. Radiative model simulations were carried out to find sources of the observed differences between the sites. It was found that Warsaw urban agglomeration induced 8 and 6 % attenuation of the erythemal and UVA doses respectively. This is mostly due to the lower sun elevation in Warsaw during the near-noon measurements and the larger optical depth of the city aerosols and increased cloudiness. It could be hypothesised that the expected stronger absorption of the solar UV radiation by urban aerosols is compensated for here by a higher surface reflectivity over the city.\n\nSalmonellosis in Poland in 2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nSadkowska-Todys, MaÅgorzata; Czarkowski, MirosÅaw P\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe purpose of the study was evaluation of epidemiological situation of salmonellosis in Poland in 2012 compared to the previous years. The main source of data for this study are statistical overviews contained in the annual bulletins \"Infectious Diseases in Poland in 2012\" (NIZP-PZH, GIS, Warsaw 2013), reports from investigations obtained from the sanitary epidemiological stations. Information on deaths due to infectious and parasitic diseases registered in Poland in 2012 and earlier years is based on the data from the Department for Demographic Research of Central Statistical Office. For the purpose of surveillance cases were classified according to the case definition. In Poland in 2012, it was reported a total of 8 444 cases of zoonotic salmonellosis including 8 267 cases of intestinal salmonellosis and 177 of extraintestinal one. The incidence was 21.9/100 000. The criteria for a confirmed case met more than 94% of cases. The number of reported cases was lower than in 2011, reflecting the continued downward trend in the number of cases of salmonellosis in Poland. A very high percentage (69.4%) hospitalizations of people infected with zoonotic Salmonella remains. In outbreaks proportion of hospitalizations accounted for one third of the cases. Predominated children under the age of 5 years. Seven people died of salmonellosis. In 2012, it was reported 181 outbreaks caused by Salmonella in which 1 511 people still. They were mostly small family outbreaks. The most common etiological agent of salmonellosis in Poland is S. enteritidis, but slightly increases the percentage cases, for which no serologic type was determined. In 2012 it stood at 14%. This proportion was highest in the Pomorskie province and amounted to 58%. Keeping up for more than 10 years in the percentage of salmonellosis hospitalization rate at 70%, indicates underreporting of the disease in the country and mostly detection of the cases requiring hospital treatment.

The aim of this work was to determine weather perception seasonal variability of people staying outdoors in urban environment for tourism and recreation, as well as to determine if personal factors influence estimation of recreationist actual biometeorological conditions and personal expectations towards weather elements. To investigate how human thermal sensations vary upon meteorological conditions typical for temperate climate, weather perception field researches were conducted in Warsaw (Poland) in all seasons. Urban recreationists' preference for slightly warm thermal conditions, sunny, windless and cloudless weather, were identified as well as PET values considered to be optimal for sightseeing were defined between 27.3 and 31.7 Â°C. The results confirmed existence of phenomena called alliesthesia, which manifested in divergent thermal perception of comparable biometeorological conditions in transitional seasons. The results suggest that recreationist thermal sensations differed from other interviewees' responses and were affected not only by physiological processes but they were also conditioned by psychological factors (i.e. attitude, expectations). Significant impact of respondents' place of origin and its climate on creating thermal sensations and preferences was observed.

Hydrological investigations of the Zagozdzonka River at Plachty (N51Â°26'43.8''; E21Â°27'35.6''), have been carried out by the Department of River Engineering of Warsaw University of Life Science (WULS) since 1962. The catchment area is 82.4 km2 at the Plachty river gauging station. Annual data of temperature, annual and seasonal rainfall and runoff characteristics, as well as annual N-day (1-, 2-, 3-, 7-, 14- and 30-day) low flow from the catchment of the period of 53-year (1963-2015) were analysed. Mann-Kendall test was used for trend analysis. Analysis has revealed a long term decrease in annual discharge and in all of the analysed N-day low flows from the catchment, as well as a corresponding increase in annul temperature (1.61ÂºC/50 years) for this area of Poland. No trend was detected for annual precipitation nor summer/winter half year precipitation. There was little land use change in the catchment but remarkable increase of crop yields from the arable land in this region of Poland in the last 50 years, due to fertilisation. So the long term decrease of annual discharge and N-day low flows is assumed to be effect of higher evapotranspiration. The decrease of water resources in summer periods may cause problems when more intensive agriculture practice is planned (and water for irrigation is needed).\n\nContrasting academic and tobacco industry estimates of illicit cigarette trade: evidence from Warsaw, Poland.\n\nPubMed\n\nStoklosa, Michal; Ross, Hana\n\n2014-05-01\n\nTo compare two different methods for estimating the size of the illicit cigarette market with each other and to contrast the estimates obtained by these two methods with the results of an industry-commissioned study. We used two observational methods: collection of data from packs in smokers' personal possession, and collection of data from packs discarded on streets. The data were obtained in Warsaw, Poland in September 2011 and October 2011. We used tests of independence to compare the results based on the two methods, and to contrast those with the estimate from the industry-commissioned discarded pack collection conducted in September 2011. We found that the proportions of cigarette packs classified as not intended for the Polish market estimated by our two methods were not statistically different. These estimates were 14.6% (95% CI 10.8% to 19.4%) using the survey data (N=400) and 15.6% (95% CI 13.2% to 18.4%) using the discarded pack data (N=754). The industry estimate (22.9%) was higher by nearly a half compared with our estimates, and this difference is statistically significant. Our findings are consistent with previous evidence of the tobacco industry exaggerating the scope of illicit trade and with the general pattern of the industry manipulating evidence to mislead the debate on tobacco control policy in many countries. Collaboration between governments and the tobacco industry to estimate tobacco tax avoidance and evasion is likely to produce upward-biased estimates of illicit cigarette trade. If governments are presented with industry estimates, they should strictly require a disclosure of all methodological details and data used in generating these estimates, and should seek advice from independent experts.

The samples of sediments, soil, and plants were analyzed in terms of Cu and Cd content. The research concerned the heap of dredged bottom sediments from WyÅcigi Pond, Warsaw, Poland. Two boreholes were made to obtain sediment cores with depths of A 162.5Â cm and B 190.0Â cm. The cores were divided into 10 sub-samples with a thickness of about 15-20Â cm. A control sample of soil was taken from the horse racecourse several hundred meters away from the heap. The vegetation was sampled directly from the heap. The predominating plants were tested: Urtica dioica, Glechoma hederacea, Euonymus verrucosus, and Drepanocladus aduncus. A control sample of U. dioica taken outside of the heap was also tested. The commercial PHYTOTOXKIT microbiotest was applied to evaluate the influence of heavy metal-contaminated sediments (used as soil) on germination and growth of the chosen test plants. The analyses of cadmium and copper concentrations revealed that the metal concentration in sediments was diverse at different depths of sampling, probably reflecting their concentration in stored layers of sediments. Moreover, the metal content in core A was four to five times lower than that in core B, which reveals heterogeneity of the sediments in the tested heap. In core A, the copper concentration ranged from 4.7 to 13.4Â mg/kg d.w. (average 8.06âÂ±â0.71Â mg/kg d.w.), while in core B, it ranged from 9.2 to 82.1Â mg/kg d.w. (average 38.56âÂ±â2.6Â mg/kg d.w.). One of the results of the heavy metal presence in soils is their bioaccumulation in plants. Comparing plant growth, more intensive growth of roots was observed in the case of plants growing on the control (reference) soil than those growing on sediments. The intensive development of both primary and lateral roots was noticed. During this early growth, metal accumulation in plants occurred.\n\nEnsuring safety of home-produced eggs to control salmonellosis in Poland: lessons from an outbreak in September 2011.\n\nPubMed\n\nZielicka-Hardy, A; Zarowna, D; Szych, J; Madajczak, G; Sadkowska-Todys, M\n\n2012-11-22\n\nImplementation of control measures in line with European Commission regulations has led to a decrease in salmonellosis in the European Union since 2004. However, control programmes do not address laying hens whose eggs are produced for personal consumption or local sale. This article reports an investigatxion of a salmonellosis outbreak linked to home-produced eggs following a family event held in a farm in September 2011 near Warsaw, Poland. In the outbreak, 34 people developed gastroenteritis symptoms. Results from a cohort study indicated a cake, prepared from raw home-produced eggs, as the vehicle of the outbreak. Laboratory analysis identified Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) in stool samples or rectal swabs from 18 of 24 people and in two egg samples. As no food items remained, we used phage typing to link the source of the outbreak with the isolated strains. Seven S. Enteritidis strains analysed (five from attendees and two from eggs) were phage type 21c. Our findings resulted in culling of the infected laying hens and symptomatic pigeons housed next to the hens. Salmonella poses as a public health problem in Poland: control measures should not forget home-produced eggs, as there is a risk of infection from their consumption.\n\nLustration: Transitional Justice in Poland and Its Continuous Struggle to Make Means With the Past\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-06-01\n\nWarsaw, just as the secret police did over its citizens.

Since 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in cooperation with partner organizations have been working on the implementation of the global control system known as the Global Tobacco Surveillance System (GTSS). This system expands the opportunities of individual countries in the area of designing, implementing and evaluating comprehensive anti-tobacco programs. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) has been incorporated into the GTSS system in 2007. The aim of the work is to explain and promote the objectives of GATS and the process of its implementation in Poland based on current experiences of the WHO Country Office for Poland. GATS concentrates on monitoring of tobacco use by adults (aged over 15 years). It is a representative, national survey of households, standardized on a global scale. GATS is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies as a part of the Bloomberg Global Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use. Two executive agencies, the M. SkÅodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology, Warsaw and the Warsaw Medical University, have been assigned to implement the Global Adult Tobacco Survey in Poland. The prepatory works for pre-testing and further stages of the survey implementation are currently under the final phase. Data gathered by GATS will enable us to learn more about the use of tobacco by the adult population in Poland. They will also indicate the most effective methods of the tobacco control in our country.\n\nThe Jewish psychiatric hospital, ZofiÃ³wka, in Otwock, Poland.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeeman, Mary V\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe T4 euthanasia programme within Nazi Germany has been well researched, but much less is known about the extermination of psychiatric patients in Nazi-occupied territories during the same period.

With each method, 136 midnight relative humidity profiles were obtained for lidar observations from July 2013 to August 2015. Comparisons of these profiles showed in favor of the latter method (iii), but it also indicated that the other two data sources could replace it, if necessary. Such use was demonstrated for an automated retrieval of water vapor mixing ratio from dusk until dawn on 19/20 March 2015; a case study related to an advection of biomass burning aerosol from forest fires over Ukraine. Additionally, an algorithm that applies thresholds to the radiosounding relative humidity profiles to estimate macro-physical cloud vertical structure was used for the first time on the Raman lidar relative humidity profiles. The results, based on a subset of 66 profiles, indicate that below 6 km cloud bases/tops can be successfully obtained in 53% and 76% cases from lidar and radiosounding profiles, respectively. Finally, a contribution of the lidar derived mean relative humidity to cloudy conditions within the range of 0.8 to 6.2 km, in comparison to clear-sky conditions, was estimated.\n\n[Chickenpox in Poland in 2010].\n\nPubMed\n\nGÅuchowska, MaÅgorzata; Paradowska-Stankiewicz, Iwona\n\n2012-01-01\n\nChickenpox is a common childhood disease. It occurs sporadically in persons over the age of 15. Regardless of the fact that chickenpox is considered to be a disease of benign course, it may cause complications of different severity levels and with necessity of hospitalization. Since 2004, a high incidence of chickenpox is observed in Poland. The aim of the present article was to analyze the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2010 with its comparison to the situation observed in the previous years. The epidemiological situation ofchickenpox in Poland in 2010 was analyzed on the basis of aggregated data on infectious diseases published in the annual bulletins, i.e.: \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2010\" (Czarkowski MP. et al., Warsaw, NIPH-NIH, Chief Sanitary Inspectorate) and \"Vaccinations in Poland in 2010\" (Czarkowski MP. et al., Warsaw, NIPH-NIH, Chief Sanitary Inspectorate). In the present article the authors also referred to the Polish Immunization Programme for 2010 (annex to the statement of the Chief Sanitary Inspector of 22 October 2009). The data on the number of hospitalized persons and complications due to the chickenpox was derived from the Department - Centre for Monitoring and Analyses of Population Health Status and Health Care System (NIPH-NIH). In 2010, 183 446 cases of chickenpox were reported. The highest number of chickenpox cases was registered in mazowieckie voivodeship, the lowest--in podlaskie voivodeship. The incidence was estimated at 480.04 per 100 000 population and was significantly higher than the incidence observed in 2009 (367.2). The highest chickenpox incidence, which amounted to 4298.4 per 100 000, was reported in children aged 5-9 years. The highest number ofchickenpox cases (the peak) was reported in the period from January to June. The lowest number of cases was registered in September. The chickenpox incidence was higher in men than women and in the inhabitans of villages (498.6 per 100 000\n\nElectron beam technologies in Poland state of the art and possibilities of development\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWojcicki, S.\n\n1994-12-31\n\nThe recent state of high energy electron beam /EB/ used for metals melting and welding in Poland has been presented.

In Poland since 2002, chickenpox vaccination is recommended. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological situation of chickenpox in Poland in 2011 and to compare with the situation in the previous years. Assessment of the epidemiological situation chickenpox in 2011 in Poland was based on analysis of the data published in the annual bulletins: \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2011.\" and \"Immunization Safety in Poland in 2011 (Czarkowski MP. Et al., Warsaw, NIPH-NIH, GIS). In addition, on data from the \"Immunization Program for 2011\" (Annex to the Statement of the Chief Sanitary Inspector on Oct. 28, 2010). In 2011. 172 855 registered cases of chickenpox were registered in Poland n 2011. Incidence was 448.7/100. It was lower than in 2010. (480.4/100,000). Highest incidence was in Mazowieckie, the lowest in Podlaskie. Across the age groups the highest incidence (3708.7/100,000) was reported in age group 5-9. The incidence of chickenpox in men (472.3/100,000) was higher than in women (426.5/100,000). In inhabitants of rural areas it was higher (473.5) than among urban residents (432.7/100,000). Number of hospitalized cases was 1 016. Number of people vaccinated against chickenpox amounted to 38 943 people. In 2011 there was small decrease in the incidence of chickenpox. But the rising trend is continuing in Poland since 2004. It can be partly be explained by improved surveillance of the disease.

Most cases of Lyme disease occur in the North- East region of Poland; however, it is important to note that the disease is no longer solely a problem of this region of Poland. The aim of this work is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2012 as compared to the situation in the previous years. Assessment of the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was made on the basis of an analysis of individual notifications of suspected Lyme disease submitted to NIZP-NIH by the Provincial Sanitary- Epidemiological Stations; as well as data from \"Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2012\" bulletin, and \"Vaccinations in Poland in 2012\" bulletin (MP Czarkowski and Co, Warsaw 2013, NIPH-NIH, NCI). In 2012 there were 8 782 registered cases of Lyme disease and it is 4.3% higher than in the previous year. The overall incidence in the country amounted to 23.8 per 100 000 people. The highest incidence rate was recorded in Podlaskie province - 75.5 per 100 000 people. 2 063 people were hospitalized due to Lyme disease. In 2012 incidence rate of Lyme disease was gradually dropping down. The registered number of cases was reduced by 4.1% in comparison to the previous year. There is still a fairly low percentage of cases detected with diagnostic test called Western blot method.\n\n[Scarlet fever in Poland in 2010].\n\nPubMed\n\nStaszewska, Ewa; Kondej, Barbara; Czarkowski, MirosÅaw P\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAssessing the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland in 2010. The analysis was based mainly on data published in the bulletin, \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2010\" (Warsaw 2011, NIPH-NIH , CSI). Since 2004, Poland is observed epidemic growth in the number of scarlet fever cases. However, incidence level is much lower than in previous epidemic periods. There were 13,940 cases registered in 2010 in total and the incidence was 36.5 per 100,000 population ranging from 18.1 in ÅÃ³dzkie voivodeship to 47.5 in mazowieckie voivodeship. Cases among children and adolescents of less than 15 years of age accounted for 97.0% of all cases. The highest incidence was observed among 4 years old children (603.1) and 5 years old children (624.9). Incidence in men (41.8) markedly exceeded the incidence in women (31.6) and incidence in urban areas (41.3) and in rural areas (29.0). Approximately 1.2% of all cases were hospitalized. Due to scarlet fever there were no deaths in Poland in 2010. Favourable epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland is largely a result of demographic changes--reducing the involvement of children in society. In terms of disease prevention and control is necessary to increase the proportion of cases in which clinical diagnosis is confirmed by the result of bacteriological tests.\n\nSigning of ESO-Poland Accession Agreement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2014-12-01\n\nAn agreement was signed by Professor Lena Kolarska-BobiÅska, the Polish Minister of Science and Higher Education, and the ESO Director General Tim de Zeeuw in Warsaw on 28 October 2014 that will lead to the country joining ESO.

This is unsurprising, as much of the world is in this sense âpostcolonialâ. But not all of it. This article focuses on Poland, often theorised as peripheral to âold Europeâ, and explores the application of postcolonial analyses to this âotherâ place. The article draws upon reflections arising from a study of responses to ethnic diversity in Warsaw, Poland. In doing so we conclude that postcolonialism does indeed offer some important insights into understanding Polish attitudes to other nationalities, and yet more work also needs to be done to make the theoretical bridge. In the case of Poland we propose the âtriple relationâ be the starting point for such work.

Many Polish students were attending in Paris natural history, botany, zoology, chemistry and mineralogy courses. The Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning was the largest scientific society and one of the most important scientific institutions in Poland. It had also an impact on the political and cultural life of the country, occupied and deprived of freedom at that time. Amongst its founders and members, could be found listeners to the lectures of Lamarck, HaÃ¼y, Vauquelin, Desfontaines, Jussieu. Moreover, seven professors of the National Museum of Natural History were elected foreign members of the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning: Cuvier, Desfontaines, HaÃ¼y, Jussieu, Latreille, Mirbel, Vauquelin. The article analyses this choice and underlines the relationship between these scientists and Warsaw's scientists. The results of this research allow to confirm that the National Museum of Natural History was the most important foreign institution in the 19th century for Polish science, and more specifically natural sciences.\n\nSchmallenberg virus antibodies detected in Poland.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaba, J; Czopowicz, M; Witkowski, L\n\n2013-02-01\n\nBetween 24 and 30 July 2012 230 adult goats from three western provinces of Poland bordering on Germany (Western Pomerania, Lubuskie and Lower Silesia) were blood-sampled and tested for antibodies to Schmallenberg virus (SBV) using indirect immunoenzymatic test (ID ScreenÂ® Schmallenberg virus indirect, IDvet Innovative Diagnostics).

Guided by resiliency theory, we examine if developmental risk and promotive factors are associated with substance abuse risk. Objectives We examined the association between adolescent cigarette and alcohol use and related risk and promotive factors including maternal support, neighboursâ informal social control, friendsâ acceptance of substance use, and alcohol and cigarette use by nonparental adults. Method Data were collected from a random sample of 13â14-year old students attending Warsaw middle schools (N=3029). We used hierarchical regression models and examined compensatory and protective models of resilience, controlling for sociodemograhic factors. Results Our results indicated that friendsâ acceptance of substance use and perceived drug use among nonparental adults was associated with increased risk cigarette and alcohol use among youth. We found that maternal support moderated the relationship between friendsâ acceptance of substance use and cigarette use (protective model of resilience). Thus, maternal support buffered the negative effects of friendsâ acceptance of use on youthsâ cigarette use. Neighborâs informal social control and maternal support were associated with reduced risk of alcohol use (compensatory model of resilience). Conclusion Collectively, results of the study support compensatory and protective models of resilience in a large representative sample of Warsaw adolescents.

The development was conducted in the frame of the ESA-ESRIN SAMIRA project. The new AOD algorithm aims at providing the aerosol optical depth maps over the territory of Poland with a high temporal resolution of 15 minutes. It was tested on the data set obtained between 11-16 September 2016, during which a day of relatively clean atmospheric background related to an Arctic airmass inflow was surrounded by a few days with well increased aerosol load of different origin. On the clean reference day, for estimating surface reflectance the AOD forecast available on-line via the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) was used. The obtained AOD maps were validated against AODs available within the Poland-AOD and AERONET networks, and with AOD values obtained from the PollyXT-UW lidar. of the University of Warsaw (UW).\n\nPoland action plan for water and wastewater: Bielsko-biala and Warsaw, Poland.

A more accurate characterization of disease was based on the individual reports sent to the Department of Epidemiology, NIPH-NIH. In the last decade the incidence of tetanus has remained below 0.08/100 000 inhabitants. The average annual incidence was lower than in the previous decade, but within the last ten years to the annual variation is difficult to assign a distinct incidence tendency. Rather, they correspond to random fluctuations. In 2010, 16 cases were reported, including which occurred in 2009. All cases was reported as probable--diagnosis based on clinical signs and information about injuries. Overall incidence was 0.042/100 000, which was small and not significanty different from incidence in 2009 (0.05/100 000). All cases in 2010, were over 59 years of age, which is a strong expression of the trend observed for years that the disease is present in older age groups where the level of vaccination against tetanus is particularly low. Among people infected, there were three men and 13 women. Four cases ended with deaths. Three of these were women, among whom mortality was 23.1%, and one death occurred in a man, mortality 33.3%. Three deaths occurred among the 6 cases in people over 79 years of age, mortality 50%. The incubation period of the disease in 3 cases was less than 7 days, in 4 cases 8-14 days, in 4 cases 15-21 days, in 2 cases 22 days and more. Portals of entry of infection in 7 cases accounted for abrasion or laceration, in 6 cases the puncture wound in one it was bitten wound, and\n\nScreening for major cardiovascular risk factors among Members of Polish Parliament as a continuation of health marketing for effective cardiovascular prevention in Poland.

To improve the situation in this area, a national cardiovascular preventive project is necessary, and it can be done by close cooperation between medical and political agencies. To present the current epidemiological situation in Poland to political and key opinion leaders and also to assess individual cardiovascular risk among Members of Polish Parliament. The Project was carried out on 23-24 May 2006 in the residence of the Polish Parliament. Anthropometric, blood pressure and cholesterol measurements and a short questionnaire were performed. Survey and educational programme were carried out on 310 out of 460 Members of the Polish Parliament (females 59, males 251). Awareness of one's own blood pressure was declared by 70% of subjects, 39% declared earlier detected arterial hypertension, 21% had new detected elevated blood pressure, 31% declared earlier detected elevated cholesterol level and 32% had new detected elevated cholesterol level. Obesity was found in 40%, smoking was declared by 16.5%. The results were compared with those obtained in corresponding age-groups in the general population. 1. The results of screening survey in the Polish Parliament in 2006 indicate that, in comparison with nationwide adult population and Parliament Members examined in the year of 2000, present Parliament Members are more often diagnosed with obesity. However, they present with a better awareness of their own blood pressure and better control of arterial hypertension, as well as much lower percentage of those who admit smoking cigarettes. 2. Drawing Parliament Members attention to the problem of high prevalence and insufficient control of cardiovascular risk factors should result in positive outcome of future legislation process and make the battle with the epidemic of heart attacks and strokes in Poland more successful.\n\nRabies in Poland in 2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nSadkowska-Todys, MaÅgorzata; Kucharczyk, BoÅ¼ena\n\n2014-01-01\n\nEvaluation of the epidemiological situation of rabies in Poland in 2012. Evaluation was based on the analysis of data from questionnaires sent by the Epidemiological-Sanitary Stations. The data are from questionnaires of persons who were administered vaccine against rabies following exposure in Poland and beyond its territory and data from annual bulletin \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012\"(Czarkowski MP et al., Warsaw, NIH and CSI) and epizootic data provided by the General Veterinary Inspectorate. In 2012, a total of 257 animal rabies cases were registered in Poland, i.e. nearly 60% more compared to 2011. More than 83% of these cases were reported in Podkarpackie province. Compared to 2011, more than 3.5 increase was noted there. One rabid dog was reported in ÅlÄ skie province where one rabies infection in fox was noted there a year ago. Rabies infections in terrestrial animals were also reported in the following provinces: MaÅopolskie, Lubelskie, WarmiÅsko-mazurskie and Podlaskie. Single rabies infections in bats were registered in other regions of Poland. In 2012, a total of 7,753 persons were vaccinated against rabies, including 315, i.e. more than 4% due to the exposure to animals infected with rabies virus. Of persons vaccinated due to contact with a rabid animal, nearly 40% and more than 44% were vaccinated following contact with rabid fox and domestic animal, respectively. As with the previous years, humans were vaccinated mostly due to contact with dogs and cats in which rabies could not be excluded - 5,974 persons (77%). A reason for concern is an increase in the number of animal rabies cases reported in 2012, especially in Podkarpackie province. Epizootic situation in Poland affects slightly the number of persons vaccinated against rabies who had contact with an animal which potentially is a source of rabies virus. Since many years, this number remains stable, amounting to 7-8,000 annually.\n\nHepatitis C in Poland in 2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nParda, Natalia; Henszel, Lukasz; StÄpieÅ, MaÅgorzata\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn Poland, an estimated 2 000 HCV infections are reported annually, of which chronic stage of infections predominates (>95%). It is estimated that seroprevalence of anti-HCV and prevalence of active infections in the general population amount to ca 0.95% (more than 320 000 persons) and 0.6% (230 000 persons), respectively. The alarming finding is that approximately 90% of persons diagnosed with HCV infection are unaware of the condition and consequently hepatitis C virus may be transmitted to their contacts. The objective of the present article is to determine the epidemiology of HCV infections in Poland in 2012 comparing to the preceding years. The assessment of epidemiological situation of HCV infections in Poland was based on the analysis of aggregated data from the State Sanitary Inspection, published in \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012\" (Czarkowski MP et al. \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2012\" Warsaw, NIPH-NIH and CSI). The data on mortality due to hepatitis C, which was obtained from the Demographic Surveys and Labour Market Department of Central Statistical Office, were also employed. In 2012, Poland reported 2 292 HCV infections, meeting 2005 definition (incidence 5.95), of which 1.4% were co-infections with HCV and HBV (33 cases). Compared to the data of 2011, the incidence was slightly lower (2 338; 6.07). Given 2009 definition, a total of 2 265 cases were reported (5.88), which constituted an increase of 3.5% compared to the data from the previous year (2 241; 5.82). Overall, 217 fatal cases due to hepatitis C were reported in 2012, of whom only 9 (4%) were due to acute stage of infection. Compared to the data from 2011, the epidemiological situation of hepatitis C in Poland has not changed significantly. The alarming fact is the increasing number of deaths due to hepatitis C. Probably, it suggests delayed diagnosis of HCV infections. Thus, it is a necessity to promote early diagnosis of HCV infections which can\n\nMicrobeam X-ray analysis in Poland - past and future\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKusinski, J.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe article provides an overview of the development of electron beam X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) in Poland. Since the introduction by Prof. Bojarski of EMPA over 45 years ago, tremendous advances in methodologies and in instrumentation have been made in order to improve the precision of quantitative compositional analysis, spatial resolution and analytical sensitivity. This was possible due to the activity of Applied Crystallography Committee at the Polish Academy of Sciences, as well as the groups of researches working in the Institute for Ferrous Metallurgy (Gliwice), the Technical University of Warsaw, the Silesian Technical University (Katowice), the AGH-University of Sciences and Technology (Krakow), and the Institute of Materials Science and Metallurgy Polish Academy of Sciences (Krakow). Based on the research examples realized by these teams, conferences, seminars and congresses organized, as well as books and academic textbooks issued, the evolution of electron beam X-ray microanalysis in Poland is demonstrated.\n\n[Lyme borreliosis in Poland in 2010].\n\nPubMed\n\nParadowska-Stankiewicz, Iwona; ChrzeÅcijaÅska, Irena\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLyme borreliosis is an animal, affecting multiple systems infectious disease transmitted to humans by the ticks (vector) belonging to the genus Ixodes. The incidence of Lyme borreliosis is conterminous with the ticks habitat and covers the Northern Hemisphere. The Department of Epidemiology of National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH-NIH) is liable for the registration of Lyme borreliosis since 1996. The highest incidence of Lyme borreliosis is observed in the north-east region, but it should be noted that the disease is not only restricted to the aforesaid area of Poland. The aim of the present article is to analyze the epidemiological situation of Lyme borreliosis in Poland in 2010 with its comparison to the situation observed in the previous years. The epidemiological situation of Lyme borreliosis in Poland was analyzed on the basis of case-based questionnaires for Lyme borreliosis sent to Epidemiology Department NIPH-NIH by the Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations and the data from the bulletin--\"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2010\" (MP Czarkowski et al., Warsaw 2011, NIPH-NIH, Chief Sanitary Inspectorate). In 2010, 9005 Lyme borreliosis cases were registered in Poland, which constitutes a 13% decrease in the number of reported cases and incidence (23.6 per 100 000 population) in the comparison with the previous year. The highest incidence, accounting for 76.0 per 100 000 population, was reported in podlaskie voivodeship. 2318 persons were hospitalized due to Lyme borreliosis. In 2010, for the first time in eight years, an increased tendency of the number of registered Lyme borreliosis cases was not observed. An approximately 13% decline in the number of notified cases was reported in comparison with the previous year. There is still a low number of Western blot tests performed to confirm the disease.\n\nLocal-scale analysis of temperature patterns over Poland during heatwave events\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrzyÅ¼ewska, Agnieszka; Dyer, Jamie\n\n2018-01-01\n\nHeatwaves are predicted to increase in frequency, duration, and severity in the future, including over Central Europe where populations are sensitive to extreme temperature. This paper studies six recent major heatwave events over Poland from 2006 through 2015 using regional-scale simulations (10-km grid spacing, hourly frequency) from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to define local-scale 2-m temperature patterns. For this purpose, a heatwave is defined as at least three consecutive days with maximum 2-m air temperature exceeding 30 Â°C. The WRF simulations were validated using maximum daily 2-m temperature observations from 12 meteorological stations in select Polish cities, which were selected to have even spatial coverage across the study area. Synoptic analysis of the six study events shows that the inflow of tropical air masses from the south is the primary driver of heatwave onset and maintenance, the highest temperatures (and most vulnerable areas) occur over arable land and artificial surfaces in central and western Poland, while coastal areas in the north, mountain areas in the south, and forested and mosaic areas of smaller fields and pastures of the northwest, northeast, and southeast are less affected by prolonged periods of elevated temperatures. In general, regional differences in 2-m temperature between the hottest and coolest areas is about 2-4 Â°C. Large urban areas like Warsaw, or the large complex of artificial areas in the conurbation of Silesian cities, are also generally warmer than surrounding areas by roughly 2-4 Â°C, and even up to 6 Â°C, especially during the night. Additionally, hot air from the south of Poland flows through a low-lying area between two mountain ranges (Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains)âthe so-called Moravian Gateâhitting densely populated urban areas (Silesian cities) and Cracow. These patterns occur only during high-pressure synoptic conditions with low cloudiness and wind and without any active fronts\n\nResults from a first production of enhanced Silicon Sensor Test Structures produced by ITE Warsaw\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBergauer, T.; Dragicevic, M.; Frey, M.; Grabiec, P.; Grodner, M.; HÃ¤nsel, S.; Hartmann, F.; Hoffmann, K.-H.; Hrubec, J.; Krammer, M.; Kucharski, K.; Macchiolo, A.; Marczewski, J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMonitoring the manufacturing process of silicon sensors is essential to ensure stable quality of the produced detectors. During the CMS silicon sensor production we were utilising small Test Structures (TS) incorporated on the cut-away of the wafers to measure certain process-relevant parameters. Experience from the CMS production and quality assurance led to enhancements of these TS. Another important application of TS is the commissioning of new vendors. The measurements provide us with a good understanding of the capabilities of a vendor's process. A first batch of the new TS was produced at the Institute of Electron Technology in Warsaw Poland. We will first review the improvements to the original CMS test structures and then discuss a selection of important measurements performed on this first batch.\n\nHermann Mooser, Typhus, Warsaw 1941.\n\nPubMed\n\nLindenmann, Jean\n\n2002-01-01\n\nHermann Mooser (1891-1971), a Swiss rickettsiologist, sent his friend Peyton Rous (1879-1970) of the Rockefeller Institute (New York) a telegram on November 3, 1941, asking for financial help for the manufacture of typhus vaccine in Zurich for the Warsaw Ghetto.

Since 2004 in Poland has been observed epidemic increase in the number of scarlet fever cases. However, the growth rate is significantly slower and incidence is considerably lower than in previous epidemic periods. In 2011, in the country a total of 18 267 cases were registered and incidence was 47.4 per 100,000 population (in provinces: from 23.4 in ÅÃ³dzkie to 68.0 in Slaskie). The highest incidence was notified in 5-year-old and 6-year-old children (782.4), whereas the incidence of children and young people up to 15 years accounted for 96.9% of all cases. The incidence of men 53.7 by almost 30% was higher than the incidence of women (41.6). The incidence was higher in urban areas than in rural areas and was 53.3 (in rural area 38.3). 1.1% of patients were hospitalized. No deaths were reported. An impact on the epidemiological situation of scarlet fever in Poland in the last two decades have i.a. demographic changes--decline in the population of children, i.e. in group which is particularly vulnerable to infection. In order to raising the reliability of surveillance data, it is recommended a prominent heightening of the percentage of cases which clinical diagnosis would be confirmed by the result of bacteriological examination.\n\nSport and Other Motor Activities of Warsaw Students\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBiernat, Elzbieta\n\n2011-01-01\n\nStudy aim: To assess the engagement of students of Warsaw university schools in sports and in recreational motor activities.

Five indices enabling the assessment of the intensity and frequency of both extremely dry and wet conditions were applied. The indices included the number of days with precipitation â¥10mmÂ·d-1 (R10), maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD), maximum 5-day precipitation total (R5d), simple daily intensity index (SDII), and the fraction of annual total precipitation due to events exceeding the 95th percentile calculated for the period 1961-1990. Annual trends were calculated using standard linear regression method, while the fit of the model was assessed with the F-test at the 95% confidence level. The analysed changes in extreme precipitation showed mixed patterns. A significant positive trend in the number of days with precipitation â¥10mmÂ·d-1 (R10) was observed in central Poland, while a significant negative one, in south-eastern Poland. Based on the analysis of maximum 5-day precipitation totals (R5d), statistically significant positive trends in north-western, western and eastern parts of the country were detected, while the negative trends were found in the central and northeastern parts. Daily precipitation, expressed as single daily intensity index (SDII), increased over time in northern and central Poland. In southern Poland, the variation of SDII index showed non-significant negative tendencies. Finally, the fraction of annual total precipitation due to the events exceeding the 1961-1990 95th percentile increased at one station only, namely, in Warsaw. The indicator which refers to dry conditions, i.e. maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD) displayed negative trends throughout the surveyed area, with the exception of Szczecin that is a representative of north-western Poland.\n\nOccurrence of cardiovascular drugs in the sewage-impacted Vistula River and in tap water in the Warsaw region (Poland).\n\nPubMed\n\nGiebuÅtowicz, Joanna; Stankiewicz, Albert; WroczyÅski, Piotr; NaÅÄcz-Jawecki, Grzegorz\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn recent years, cardiovascular diseases were the second most common cause of death worldwide. Therefore, the consumption of drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases is high. So far, there were no such comprehensive reports regarding the presence of cardiovascular drugs in surface and tap waters, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of 30 pharmaceutically active compounds and some of their metabolites, at specific points of the Vistula River and in tap water samples in the Warsaw region. The analysis was performed using the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method, coupled to solid-phase extraction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time where the presence of ciprofibrate in the environment was investigated. Cardiovascular drugs found at the highest concentrations (reaching 1Â Î¼g/L or higher) in surface water were beta-blockers, sartans and diuretics. In tap water samples, trace amounts of pharmaceuticals were detected, for almost all target compounds. This highlights their inadequate elimination by the treatment facility used in the Warsaw region. The presence of cardiovascular compounds in the aquatic environment could have a long-term effect even at a low exposure level, since synergy effects amongst pharmaceuticals may occur.\n\nSpatial Distribution and Conservation of Speckled Hind and Warsaw Grouper in the Atlantic Ocean off the Southeastern U.S.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFarmer, Nicholas A.; Karnauskas, Mandy\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere is broad interest in the development of efficient marine protected areas (MPAs) to reduce bycatch and end overfishing of speckled hind (Epinephelus drummondhayi) and warsaw grouper (Hyporthodus nigritus) in the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern U.S. We assimilated decades of data from many fishery-dependent, fishery-independent, and anecdotal sources to describe the spatial distribution of these data limited stocks. A spatial classification model was developed to categorize depth-grids based on the distribution of speckled hind and warsaw grouper point observations and identified benthic habitats. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a quantitative model to predict the spatial distribution of speckled hind and warsaw grouper as a function of depth, latitude, and habitat. Models, controlling for sampling gear effects, were selected based on AIC and 10-fold cross validation. The best-fitting model for warsaw grouper included latitude and depth to explain 10.8% of the variability in probability of detection, with a false prediction rate of 28â33%. The best-fitting model for speckled hind, per cross-validation, included latitude and depth to explain 36.8% of the variability in probability of detection, with a false prediction rate of 25â27%. The best-fitting speckled hind model, per AIC, also included habitat, but had false prediction rates up to 36%. Speckled hind and warsaw grouper habitats followed a shelf-edge hardbottom ridge from North Carolina to southeast Florida, with speckled hind more common to the north and warsaw grouper more common to the south. The proportion of habitat classifications and model-estimated stock contained within established and proposed MPAs was computed. Existing MPAs covered 10% of probable shelf-edge habitats for speckled hind and warsaw grouper, protecting 3â8% of speckled hind and 8% of warsaw grouper stocks. Proposed MPAs could add 24% more probable shelf-edge habitat, and protect an additional 14â29% of\n\nFlood Frequency Analysis using different flood descriptors - the Warsaw reach of the river Vistula case study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaramuz, Emilia; Kochanek, Krzysztof; Romanowicz, Renata\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFlood frequency analysis (FFA) is customarily performed using annual maximum flows. However, there is a number of different flood descriptors that could be used. Among them are water levels, peaks over the threshold, flood-wave duration, flood volume, etc. In this study we compare different approaches to FFA for their suitability for flood risk assessment. The main goal is to obtain the FFA curve with the smallest possible uncertainty limits, in particular for the distribution tail. The extrapolation of FFA curves is crucial in future flood risk assessment in a changing climate. We compare the FFA curves together with their uncertainty limits obtained using flows, water levels, flood inundation area and volumes for the Warsaw reach of the river Vistula. Moreover, we derive the FFA curves obtained using simulated flows. The results are used to derive the error distribution for the maximum simulated and observed values under different modelling techniques and assess its influence on flood risk predictions for ungauged catchments. MIKE11, HEC-RAS and transfer function model are applied in average and extreme conditions to model flow propagation in the Warsaw Vistula reach. The additional questions we want to answer are what is the range of application of different modelling tools under various flow conditions and how can the uncertainty of flood risk assessment be decreased. This work was partly supported by the projects \"Stochastic flood forecasting system (The River Vistula reach from Zawichost to Warsaw)\" and \"Modern statistical models for analysis of flood frequency and features of flood waves\", carried by the Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences on the order of the National Science Centre (contracts Nos. 2011/01/B/ST10/06866 and 2012/05/B/ST10/00482, respectively).

Now it is one of six gas distribution companies in Poland. Due to steadily increasing safety demands, some of the pipelines will need reconstruction. The majority of the substandard piping is located in urban areas. The company wanted to gain experiences in applying reconstruction technologies using two different plastic materials polyethylene and polyamide. They also wanted to assess the technical and economic practicalities of performing relining processes. A PE project--large diameter polyethylene relining (450 mm) conducted in Warsaw in 1994/95 and PA projects--relining using polyamide pipes, projects conducted in Radom andmoreÂ Â» in Warsaw during 1993 and 1994 are the most interesting and representative for this kind of works. Thanks to the experience obtained whilst carrying out these projects, reconstruction of old gas pipelines has become routine. Now they often use polyethylene relining of smaller diameters and they continue both construction and reconstruction of gas network using PA pipes. This paper presents the accumulated knowledge showing the advantages and disadvantages of applied methods. It describes project design and implementation with details and reports on the necessary preparation work, on site job organization and the most common problems arising during the construction works.Â«Â less\n\nMonitoring environmental pollution in Poland by chemical analysis of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles.\n\nPubMed\n\nDmuchowski, W; Bytnerowicz, A\n\n1995-01-01\n\nMaps of the distribution of environmental pollution by sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and arsenic (As) for the territory of Poland and the Warsaw (Warszawa) district were developed on the basis of chemical analysis of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) needles collected from randomly selected sampling points during 1983-1985. The maps show deposition zones for the studied elements and can help in identification of sources and directions of air pollution dispersion. This study indicated that vegetation in Poland is greatly endangered by sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and other sulfurous air pollutants, whereas Zn, Cd, Pb, and As do not pose an immediate threat to vegetation in most of the country's territory. However, in the urban-industrial agglomeration of Katowice-Cracow, very high pollution with Z, Cd, Pb and As could limit growth and development of some sensitive plant species. Higher than normal levels of As in some areas of Poland (Upper Silesia, Glogow-Lubin Copper Region, and areas close to the Russian border near Braniewo) might affect the health of humans and animals.

The assessment was based on the results of the data analysis from questionnaires (People vaccinated against rabies post-exposure surveys in Poland and people vaccinated against rabies after exposure in other countries) submitted by the Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations and data from the annual newsletter \"Infectious diseases and poisonings in Poland in 2011\" (Czarkowski MP et al., Warsaw, NIZP-PZH and GIS) and epizootic data provided by the General Veterinary Inspectorate. In 2011, in Poland, 160 cases of rabies (in 2010 - 152 cases) were reported. Animal cases occurred primarily in the Malopolska province, where an increase in animal rabies cases has been observed since September 2010 and in Podkarpackie province. A single case of fox rabies was reported in Silesia, where there was no disease for many years. Rabies among terrestrial animals also occurred in the provinces ofLubelskie, WarmiÅsko-Mazurskie and Podlaskie. In other regions of the country there were recorded only isolated cases of bat rabies. In 2011, number of people vaccinated against rabies was 7 543 (in 2010 - 7,243), of which 300 (4%) due to exposure to the animals that were confirmed to have rabies. Among those vaccinated because of contact with the rabid animal, 68 people (over 22%) were vaccinated after contact with fox. As in previous years, people were mainly vaccinated after exposure to dogs and cats in which rabies could not be ruled out - 5 874 persons (78%). The number of registered animals with confirmed rabies remains at the same level and the disease epizootic situation is good. This is a consequence of the implementation of the oral vaccination of wild animals introduced in the country in 1993. Epizootic situation in the country has a small influence on the number of people vaccinated against rabies who have come into contact with the animal potentially infected with the rabies. Serum is given in a few cases, including a\n\nEffects of visitor pressure on understory vegetation in Warsaw forested parks (Poland).\n\nPubMed\n\nSikorski, Piotr; Szumacher, Iwona; Sikorska, Daria; Kozak, Marcin; Wierzba, Marek\n\n2013-07-01\n\nVisitor's access to understorey vegetation in park forest stands results in the impoverishment of plant species composition and a reduction in habitat quality. The phenomenon of biotic homogenisation is typical in urban landscapes, but it can proceed differently depending on the scale, a detail that has not been observed in previous studies. This research was carried out in seven Warsaw parks (both public and restricted access). Thirty-four forested areas were randomly selected, some sub"
