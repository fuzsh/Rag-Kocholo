        "text": "-\n\nLECTURE 16.\n\nTHE COMING OF THE WAR AND EASTERN EUROPE IN WORLD WAR II.\n\nA. The British Guarantees to Poland, Romania and Greece, the Nazi-Soviet pact, and the Outbreak of World War II\n\n[This text is based largely on the authors articles, cited here. See also new publications cited in this lecture.]\n\nI would like to thank Prof. Jean Sedlar of the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, PA, for her very helpful comments and corrections, esp. on the Balkans. Her surveys of East Central Europe (including Finland] and South Eastern Europe in World War II, published in 2008 --see Bibliography-- are cited where pertinent.]\n\nI .British Attitudes toward Germany in the Aftermath of Munich.\n\nIn early October 1938, the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Joseph Patrick Kennedy (1888-1969, father of JFK, Robert and Ted Kennedy, Ambassador 1937-40), reported what Br. For. Secretary Lord Halifax had told him about British and French policy toward Germany. Halifax said they intended to strengthen their air defenses and\n\n...after that, to let Hitler go ahead and do what he likes in Central and South-Eastern Europe. In other words, there is no question in Halifaxs mind that reasonably soon Hitler will make a start for Danzig, with Polish concurrence, and even if he decides to go into Roumania it is Halifaxs idea that England should mind her own business.*\n\n*[Kennedy to the Secretary of State, October 12, 1938, Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1938 . vol. I, Washington, D.C., 1955, pp.85-86. This series is generally referred to as: FRUS].\n\nHalifax put this less crudely in his letter of November 1, 1938, to Sir Eric Phipps, British Ambassador in Paris, when he wrote:\n\nHenceforward we must count with German predominance in Central Europe. Incidentally, I have always felt myself that, once Germany recovered her normal strength, this predominance was inevitable for obvious geographical and economic reasons. *\n\n*[Documents on British Foreign Policy, 3rd series, vol. III, 1938-1939, London, 1950, doc. no. 285, p. 252].\n\nThus James Headlam-Morleys 1925 warning that German expansion in Central Europe would threaten W. Europe (Lec. Notes 15) went unheeded. Although some senior officials in the Foreign Office opposed concessions to Hitler in Central Europe, their views were ignored. The foremost opponent of appeasement, Robert Vansittart (1881-1957), lost his position as Permanent Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and thus head of the Foreign Office, in 1937 to Alexander Cadogan (1884-1968), who held that post until the end of World War II.\n\nDespite internal opposition and criticism from some Foreign Office members, and vocal opposition from some politicians, British statesmen still believed that German expansion in Central and S.E. Europe would not have any dangerous consequences for Western Europe. However, British public opinion was deeply divided over Munich. While there was much admiration for Chamberlain for havinga avoided war, there was a strong feeling that while the Munich decisions may have been unavoidable, the Western Powers should make no more concessions to Hitler. Opposition to Chamberlains appeasement policy also grew within the Conservative Party; it was led by Winston Churchill (1874-1965). He had warned against Germany and given information (sometimes exaggerated) on its rearmament since 1935. Although he had supported intervention against the Bolsheviks in 1918-19, he now advocated a \"Grand Alliance\" of Britain, France and USSR to stop Hitler.\n\n2. French Attitudes.\n\nFrench Premier Edouard Daladier (1884-1970) was very surprised at the welcome he received on landing in Paris when he returned by air from Munich. He had expected anger at betraying Czechoslovakia - but was met with cheers and flowers. He said the people did not realize what had happened. Indeed, after the initial joy at avoiding war had passed, public opinion polls showed that most French people thought like the British - - that Munich was unavoidable, but no more concessions should be made to Hitler.\n\nUnlike Daladier, French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet (1887-1973) was a convinced appeaser. On December 6, 1938, he signed an agreement in Paris with German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop (1893-1946) that the two governments would consult each other on questions of mutual interest. This was, in fact, like the Chamberlain-Hitler agreement signed at Munich on September 30 - but Ribbentrop saw the agreement signed with Bonnet as French resignation from interest in Central Europe. Bonnet denied this officially in a diplomatic note of July 1, 1939. However, in a work published after the war he seemed to confirm Ribbentrops impression. Thus, in his book on the French Foreign Ministry under the first three republics (published in Paris,1961), Bonnet wrote that a Franco-German \"entente\" could have been the first step to a United States of Europe (!). He also wrote that, at the time, one could hope Hitler would be clever enough to settle the Danzig-Corridor question at another conference.* It is clear that this reflected Bonnets own hopes in 1938-39.\n\n*[Georges Bonnet, Le Quai dOrsay sous Trois Republiques, Paris, 1961, p.240, 243-44].\n\nII. Polish-German Relations, October 1938 - January 1939.\n\n1. On October 24, 1938, Ribbentrop told Polish Ambasssador Jozef Lipski (1894-1958, Minister, then Ambassador in Berlin, 1932-39, later in the West), that Germany could offer Poland a \"general settlement\" of all outstanding questions. Ribbentrop proposed that: (1) Poland agree to the abrogation of Danzigs status as a Free City and its return to the Reich, while preserving all its rights there, also to a German extra-territorial highway and railway through the Polish Corridor to Danzig and East Prussia; (2) Poland would join the \"Anti-Comintern Pact.\"* In return, Germany would guarantee the Polish-German frontier and extend the Declaration of Nonaggression of 1934 for 25 years.\n\n*[Oct.25, 1936, German-Italian Pact; Nov. 26. 1936, German-Japanese Pact; Nov. 6, 1937, Italian-Japanese Pact against the Comintern. These pacts came to be known as the Anti-Comintern Pact].\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Jozef Beck (1894-1944, For. Min. 1932-39) instructed Lipski to give a negative answer on Danzig , but say that negotiations were possible to improve German railway traffic and on building a German highway through the Polish Corridor. This seems to be have been a gambit to gain time, and there is no trace of any agreement by the Polish \"Castle Council\" (President, For. Min., Army Chief,and selected others meeting in the President's rooms in the Royal Castle, Warsaw) to this project. Finally, Beck said nothing to the invitation to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, which was equivalent to a refusal.\n\nRibbentrops proposal seems quite reasonable. However, we know what Hitlers real intentions were from information given by the Danzig \"Gauleiter\" (Party district leader) Albert Forster (1902-1950) to the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Carl Jakob Burckhardt (1891-1974, in Danzig 1937-39). In November 1938, Forster told him what he had just heard from Hitler: The Fuhrer said he would guarantee Polish frontiers for his own lifetime - but only if the Poles were \"reasonable like the Czechs.\" Burckhardt heard the same phrase from German State Secretary Ernst von Weizsacker when he visited Berlin in December 1938. Thus, it is clear that Hitlers aim was to make Poland subservient to Germany. *\n\n*[for details and references to doc. sources, see info. below on Ribbentrop visit to Warsaw, Jan. 26, 1939.]\n\nBeck played for time and worked for closer relations with Britain. In this he succeeded, for on December 15, 1938, the British government stated that it would not approve any changes in the status of Danzig without first consulting with the Polish government. This meant a defeat for Georges Bonnet, who was pushing for the removal of the High Commissioner from Danzig as well as the abolition of all League of Nations involvement in the Free City. This French proposal to Britain came on the heels of the introduction of antisemitic legislation in Danzig by Forster in November 1938, just after attacks on Jews all over Germany known as the \"Crystal Night\" because of the broken glass.\n\nHalifax rejected Bonnet's proposal because he believed that Britain might need Col. Beck in the future. It is not clear what Halifax meant by this phrase, but it seems that he saw Beck as a Polish statesman who would be willing to give Hitler what he wanted by negotiation, thus avoiding war. In any case, Halifax certainly believed that the issue could be settled peacefully.\n\nIn December 1938, with the next League of Nations session in the offing, Beck requested a meeting with Hitler to find out whether his views on Danzig and the Corridor were the same as Ribbentrops. The meeting took place in Berchtesgaden on January 5, 1939. Hitler repeated the Ribbentrop proposals of Oct. 24, 1938, to which Beck answered that he saw no equivalent for a Polish agreement that Danzig return to Germany. Ribbentrop pressed Beck on the same issue next day, and received the same answer.\n\nOn returning to Warsaw, Beck thought briefly of taking up a phrase Hitler used, when he suggested a new organism, a \"Korperschaft\" (corporation) to safeguard Polish and German interests in Danzig. Beck thought that some sort of \"condominium\" or joint Polish-German administration might provide a solution. However, the Castle Council decided that no such Polish proposal should be made because it would be the first step on the slippery slope to the loss of Polish independence. B eck agreed.\n\nThere is no clue as to what Hitler might have meant by \"corporation,\" but the whole thrust of Nazi propaganda in the Free City -- which the Nazis ruled since winning the elections in the FCD territory in May 1935 -- was \"Heim ins Reich!\" (Home to Germany). Therefore, it is possible to assume that whatever Hitler may have meant by corporation,\" it would have meant German sovereignty. Neither the Polish government nor public opinion could agree to this or to an extraterritorial German Corridor through the Polish Corridor, because then Germany could choke off Polands access to the sea. Furthermore, even a narrow German corridor through Polish Corridor would mean putting Polish people under German rule. (Many still remembered the heavy-handed Germanization policies in former Prussian, now western Poland.)\n\nOn January 26, 1939, Ribbentrop paid an official visit to Warsaw to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Polish-German Declaration of Nonaggression. of Jan. 26, 1934. However, his real objective was to secure Becks agreement to the proposals which he and Hitler had made earlier. He also tempted Beck with vistas of Polish expansion into the Soviet Ukraine, even as far as the Black Sea, but Beck did not take up the offer. Finally, they agreed that neither country would act unilaterally if the League of Nations withdrew from Danzig.* Nevertheless, German leaders still hoped to isolate Poland so that the Polish government would finally accept their \"reasonable\" proposals. *\n\n*[On German-Polish relations, Polish and British policy toward Poland in the period October- 1938 - end January 1939, see Anna M.Cienciala, Poland and the Western Powers, 1938-1939.

Toward the British Guarantee of Poland.\n\n1. In December 1938 and again February 1939, rumors reached the British government of Hitlers alleged plans to attack Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland, and bomb London at the same time. In fact, these rumors were planted by the secret German \"Resistance\" to Hitler led by Dr .Carl Friedrich Goerdeler (1884-1945, mayor of Leipzig 1930-37), which was supported by some German generals, foreign ministry officials and diplomats. In summer 1938, they secretly proposed to the British government that they would overthrow Hitler if he provoked war with the Western Powers. However, there was no war, so there was no attempt to overthrow Hitler. Now, they advised a firm British attitude toward Hitler to prevent war - but they wanted British agreement to Germany keeping Austria and the Sudetenland as well as regaining Danzig and the Polish Corridor from Poland. However, the British government did not take up the offer because it still hoped for a negotiated settlement with Hitler.\n\n2. On the night of March 14-15,1939, Hitler sent the German army into the Czech lands of Bohemia-Moravia. A Czech-Slovak dispute was his pretext for this attack. He also told the Slovak leaders to demand independence under his protection - or he would give Slovakia to Hungary. He summoned Czech President Emil Hacha (1872-1945) to Berlin, and threatened to bomb Prague if Hacha did not ask for German \"help.\" Hacha did so, Hitler sent in German troops, and announced a German \"protectorate\" over Bohemia-Moravia, as Slovakia declared its \"independence.\"\n\nHungary took her chance to occupy the rest of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, thus creating a common border with Poland. (On November 2, 1938, Hungary had received a slice of southern Slovakia and western SCR in the Vienna Award, agreed by Hitler and Italian Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano ,1903-1944, For. Min. 1936-43.)\n\nHitlers occupation of the Czech lands provoked outrage in Britain. Many saw it as proof that his word could not be trusted and public opinion demanded the government take a firm stand. Still, Neville Chamberlain proclaimed in Parliament that while he regretted Hitlers action, the French and British guarantees, promised to Czechoslovakia at Munich, did not come into play because Czechoslovakia had disintegrated in an \"internal crisis.\" He said he would still pursue his policy of seeking peace.\n\nHowever, on March 16-17, the Romanian ambassador in London, Virgil V. Tilea, informed the British government that Romania had received a German ultimatum to sign an agreement with the Reich that would make it a German satellite. Tilea may have done this on his own initiative so as to provoke a British guarantee to Romania without implicating King Carol, but it is also possible that he had the King's consent. (In fact, the Germans demanded the subordination of the Romanian economy to their needs and a treaty to this effect was signed on 23 March.) Tileas news, which spread fast in London, increased the pressure on the British government to do something to stop Hitler. Therefore, Halifax persuaded Chamberlain to insert a warning to the Fuhrer in the prepared speech he delivered in Birmingham on March 17. The Prime Minister said that Britain would not be passive if one power tried to dominate Europe.\n\nOn March 18, the British Cabinet decided to propose a declaration by Britain, France, Poland and USSR that they would \"consult\" together if there was a threat of further German aggression. On March 19, at the insistence of the French ambassador in London, the wording was changed to consult together on taking action.\n\nThat same day, the Soviet government proposed a conference of the same states to meet in Bucharest to consider what they should do. It is still unknown what Stalin wanted to gain by this proposal, but in view of his deep distrust of Britain and his previous hints to Hitler about a nonaggresion pact in 1935-1936, it is posible he intended the conference to put pressure on Hitler to come to an agreement with the USSR. Whatever the case may be, the British government distrusted the Soviets and did not want to provoke Hitler. Furthermore, the British Dominions as well as many neutral countries opposed a western alignment with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet proposal was politely rejected and Britain stuck to the declaration on consultation.\n\nOn March 22, Hitler annexed Memel ( Lith. Klaipeda) the mainly German-speaking port city of Lithuania and the surrounding region. Hitler had gone there aboard a German warship. (He was so seasick that he vowed never to set foot on a ship again.) Poland feared that he might annex Danzig, so a partial mobilization was carried out the next day in Polish Pomerania (Corridor) to warn him off. Hitler was angry, but he still hoped to persuade the Poles to grant his demands peacefully.\n\nMeanwhile, the Polish government had rejected the declaration on consultation proposed by Britain, on the grounds that if it signed along with the USSR, this might provoke a German attack on Poland. The real reason, however, was deep Polish distrust of the Soviet Union. But Foreign Minister Beck made a counter proposal. On March 22, he told the British Ambassador in Warsaw, Sir Howard Kennard, why Poland would not sign the declaration; at the same time, he proposed a secret Anglo-Polish agreement on consultation. The Polish Ambassador in London, Edward Raczynski (1891-1993, Ambassador London, 1934-45, and briefly P. For. Min. in WWII, later president of the Polish Government- in- Exile) made this proposal to Lord Halifax two days later, on the afternoon of March 24. Halifax received it well and mentioned the possibility that a British-Polish mutual assistance agreement might be negotiated later.\n\nThat same day in the late afternoon or evening, Beck told a group of high foreign ministry officials in Warsaw that Poland had to draw the line. He said Danzig was a symbol, but also involved vital Polish interests. He said that Poland was no longer isolated. (Which suggests that he might have learned of the Halifax-Raczynski conversation, although Amb. Raczynski wrote Cienciala -- in answer to her question about this --that there would not have been enough time to decypher the report he sent to Warsaw after he seeing Halifax.)\n\nOn March 25, Beck told German ambassador in Warsaw, Hans Adolf von Moltke, that Poland could not accept the German proposals received on 21 March, ( a repetition of the previous German demands). Then he instructed Lipski to tell Ribbentrop that Poland could not agree to the proposals. Lipski delivered this message to Ribbentrop on March 26. Meanwhile, the day before, on March 25, on hearing of the Polish refusal, Hitler had issued a directive to the head of the German army, General Wilhelm Keitel. Hitler said he did not want to drive Poland into the arms of Britain. However, as soon as an opportunity arose, he would crush Poland so badly that she would not play a role in European politics for decades to come. He planned to annex western Poland, ( more or less the territory of Prussian Poland in 1914), whos Polish population was to be \"evacuated\" and resettled elsewhere. For the time being, however, Hitler wanted to prevent an Anglo-Polish rapprochement. It is hard to see how British historian A.J.P.Taylor (1906-1990) could claim the directive showed that \"Hitlers objective was alliance with Poland, not her destruction.\" *\n\n[ A.J.P.Taylor, The Origins of the Second World War, London, 1961, p. 210.]\n\nThe British Cabinet considered what should be done, and the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee discussed the problem on March 27.Chamberlain said Polands attitude was uncertain as to helping Britain and France defend Romania if she were attacked, but Poland was absolutely necessary to create a \"second front\" against Germany in the East. Also, Poland might buckle and accept Hitlers demands, thus lining up with Germany... For these reasons, he favored giving Poland a unilateral guarantee. Halifax said that France and Britain could not prevent Poland and Romania from being overrun, but Chamberlain responded by saying that the Western Powers could divert some German forces by holding the Maginot Line. Finally, it was agreed to give a unilateral guarantee to Poland in order to deter Hitler from further aggression, but without setting a date when it should be given.\n\nTwo days later, on March 29, Ian Colvin, the Berlin correspondent of the News Chronicle arrived in London with the \"news\" that Hitler was about to attack Poland at any moment. Colvin had heard this from some members of the German \"resistance\" who wanted to push the British government into taking a firm stance, frighten Hitler, and thus prevent him from leading Germany into another war with the Western Powers, which they believed she would lose again. In fact, Hitler had not yet set a date for attacking Poland and the \"proof\" of attack that Colvin brought -- that is supplies sent to the German troops stationed near the Polish border -- was not at all new for the British War Office had known of it for some time. Nevertheless, with rumors flying around London, that evening, Chamberlain \"agreed to the idea of an immediate declaration of support of Poland, to counter a quick putsch by Hitler.\"*\n\n*[Note by Alexander Cadogan, Wed., 29th March 1939: The Diaries of Sir Alexander Cadogan O,M. 1938-1945, edited by Charles Dilks, London,1971, p.165].\n\nThus it was that on March 30, Halifax asked Ambassador Raczynski whether Poland would accept a British guarantee of her independence, and Ambassador Kennard transmitted the same question to Beck in Warsaw. The Polish Foreign Minister accepted the proposal at once. It should be noted that he had rejected the German demands on March 25, five days before he was offered the British guarantee.\n\nWhat Beck did not know was that the British Cabinet decided the guarantee of Polish independence was conditional on Poland not being \"stupidly obstinate\" over Danzig and relations with Germany in general, also on Poland actually fighting to defend her independence. Furthermore, at noon on March 31, Chamberlain told the British Cabinet that Britain would decide if and when Polish independence was threatened.\n\nOn the afternoon of March 31, Chamberlain read a statement in the House of Commons. He first said, at great length, that the British government believed every dispute could be negotiated. In the meanwhile, if Polish independence were threatened and Poland resisted with all her forces, Britain would do all in her power to help Poland, and France would do likewise.\n\nHowever, this was not the end of appeasement. The British guarantee of Polish independence was meant to deter Hitler from further aggression and persuade him to obtain what he wanted from Poland by negotiation. On April 1, (All Fools' Day),Geoffrey Dawson (1874-1944), the editor of the London Times, published an editorial saying the guarantee did not apply to Polish frontiers, but to Polish independence. In his diary, he noted that Halifax and Chamberlain agreed \"this was about right.\"\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Beck, who was about to depart for London, issued a strong protest and even threatened to cancel his trip, but the Foreign Office assured ambassador Raczynski that the editorial did not reflect British policy (!) Beck visited England on April 4-6, and succeeded in changing the unilateral British guarantee to Poland into a secret, provisional mutual assistance agreement between the two countries.*\n\n*[For the British guarantee to Poland and the provisional agreement of April 6, see: Anna M.Cienciala, \"Poland in British and French Policy in 1939,\" Polish Review, no. 3, 1989, cited earlier; slightly abbreviated version in Patrick Finney, ed., The Origins of the Second World War, London, 1997, pp. 413-433.].\n\nIV. The Path to War: From the end of March to August 1939.\n\nThere are several threads to follow in this period: Polish-German Relations, Polish-French Relations, Anglo-Polish Relations, Anglo-Soviet and German-Soviet relations, Anglo-German Relations, also Anglo-French guarantees to Romania and Greece. These threads were all inter-related, but for the sake of clarity, they will be discussed separately.\n\n1. Polish-German Relations.\n\nHitler reacted to the Anglo-Polish rapprochement in a speech to the Reichstag on April 28. He abrogated the Polish-German Declaration of Nonaggression of January 1934, as well as the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 1935. He listed German demands on Poland publicly for the first time, said that Poland had rejected them, and stated that he would never offer them to her again.\n\nBeck gave the Polish reply in a speech to the Polish Parliament on May 5. He declared that Poland wanted peace - but not any price, and she would not allow herself to be pushed away from the Baltic Sea. Poland, he said, was ready to negotiate with Germany, but only on an acceptable basis. He stated that Poland wanted peace - \"but not at the price of honor.\" (He meant it would dishonorable for Poland to give up her independence without a fight). Polish attempts to renew conversations with Germany failed.The head of Becks Cabinet Office, Michal Lubienski travelled to Berlin later in an attempt to see Marshal Goering -- known to favor a peaceful settlement with Poland --but the Marshal would not see him. Whatever Lubienski was to propose at this time - and it may have been the condominium project - Hitler did not want to listen.\n\nNevertheless, Beck hoped almost to the end that Hitler would step back from the abyss of another European war, and that British support would enable Poland to negotiate a compromise settlement with Germany on Danzig. Also, British pressure on Beck to do this was intense. There are indications that as late as July-August, Beck considered the idea of a Polish-German \"condominium\" in Danzig (which a Castle Conference had decided not to pursue in January), and it is known that a project for dividing the territory of the Free City between Poland and Germany was drawn up in the Polish Foreign Ministry for possible use. There was also a compromise project for a German highway through the Corridor, but it was to run through the southern part of the region which was home to many Germans. These projects show that the Polish govt. did consider a compromise possible, but there is no evidence that there was any interest in Berlin in anything but full Polish acceptance of Hitler's demands..\n\n2. Franco-Polish Relations and the question of French and British military aid to Poland.\n\nIn the British guarantee of March 31 -- which was a joint one with France --and as well as in the secret British-Polish provisional mutual assistance agreement signed April 6, 1939, Britain had promised to help Poland \"with all the means in her power.\" In the secret interpretive protocol attached to that agreement, the British recognized that a German attack on Danzig would be a threat to Polish independence. (The P. govt. maintained that there could be no German attack on Danzig without an attack on Poland as well. ) France was also bound to aid Poland by the military convention of March 1921. However, the Franco-British military general staff talks which took place in London in April 1939, ended with a secret agreement that if Poland were attacked by Germany, France and Britain would adopt a defensive strategy.\n\nDespite this agreement, in the Franco-Polish protocols on implementing the old military convention signed in Paris on May 19, 1939 the French side stated that if Germany attacked Poland, France would start bombing Germany, and after 15 days (the time needed for French mobilization), the French army would launch a grand offensive against Germany. The Poles were to fight so as to delay the advance of German troops and hold out until the French attacked in the West. If France was attacked by Germany, Poland was to attack her in the east.\n\nIt is unlikely that the French general staff really believed that French commitments to help Poland would be honored. It seems they assumed from the beginning that Poland should be encouraged to fight as long as possible in order to win time for France, which is what General Gamelin said at a Franco-British conference in September. In any case, no plans for a grand offensive against Germany were made. Furthermore. French Foreign Minister Bonnet made the ratification of the military protocols of May 19 dependent on the signing of the political protocol interpreting the Franco-Polish alliance, for he did not believe that Britain would go to war over Danzig. The political protocol was not signed until September 4, three days after the German attack on Poland, but no grand French offensive against Germany took place. Gamelin explained later that the French army had to take measures against a possible Italian attack.\n\nThe Polish general staff, for its part, believed that the military protocols signed in Paris on May 19, meant that the French had given up their defensive strategy of simply manning the Maginot Line, and would attack Germany in the West if the latter attacked Poland. They expected the French to attack the unfinished German fortifications called the Siegfried Line. This seemed logical, for such an attack would divide the German armies, while abandoning Poland would mean the Germans could later launch all their forces against France when they were ready. But the Poles did not realize the depth of the French military leaders defensive psychology. They always thought of the terrible French losses in WW I, and of the fact that a generation of potential fathers and recruits had perished in the war.\n\n3. Anglo-Polish Relations.\n\nDespite the provisional Anglo-Polish agreement on mutual assistance (April 6), British policy was still aiming at a negotiated Polish-German agreement . On May 22-23, Halifax visited Paris. He told Daladier and Bonnet that he hoped Danzig would become a Free City in Germany, and that the Vatican would help negotiate a Polish-German agreement on the Corridor at the right time. Nevertheless, the British encouraged the Poles to believe that Britain would help if Germany attacked.\n\nIn May, Anglo-Polish air staff talks took place in Warsaw. The British officers strongly implied that if Poland were attacked and the Germans bombed Polish military objectives, the British would bomb the same in Germany. If the Germans bombed Polish civilian objectives, the British would consult with the French on what action to take.\n\nIn July, General Sir Edmund Ironside, the Inspector General of British Armed Forces, visited Warsaw. His main objective was to secure clear answers from Polish military and political leaders on just how they would react to a crisis over Danzig, which was then being filled with German troops -- who arrived as tourists -- and the city was being armed to the teeth by Germany. The Poles told Ironside that they would react in proportion to the threat. They said that if Danzig was declared part of Gernany without a German attack on Poland, they would protest. But they also said they believed any German attack on Danzig would be accompanied by an attack on Poland. Despite the nature of Ironside's questions, the very fact that he visited Warsaw, and was known to be friendly to Poland, gave the impression of British determination to help the Poles in case of war.\n\nAt this time, in July 1939, the Polish military gave the British and French military an \"Enigma\" typewriter each. These had been constructed on the basis of work by three Polish mathematicians who had broken the German military \"Enigma\" code. The Polish breakthrough -- aided by the French --led to the later development of code-breaking machines by British code breakers working in the famous Bletchley Park and the development of \"Ultra,\" the secret name for the intelligence produced by breaking German codes. It was to be the Western Allies' secret weapon against Hitler.\n\nIn summer 1939, there were Anglo-Polish negotiations for a large British loan to help Polish rearmament. The loan would provide credits for Polish purchases in England. However, the British Treasury adamantly opposed this, and the War Office did not have arms to spare for the Poles. Finally, the British government agreed to give Poland a loan of 8 million pounds for buying British war equipment. Most of this went to buy British planes -- to be sent by sea from French ports to the Black Sea ports of Poland's ally, Romania -- but they were shipped off too late to help Poland, and turned back.\n\nFor the whole period from end March to the outbreak of war, the British exerted constant pressure on the Polish government not to do anything rash against Germany, and to seek a negotiated compromise with Hitler.\n\n4. Franco-British guarantees to Romania and Greece.\n\nOn April 7, Italian forces invaded Albania. This meant an Italian threat to Greece, while Romania seemed threatened by Germany. (On March 23, a German-Romanian treaty was signed subordinating the Romanian economy to German needs). Therefore, the British and French governments now guaranteed the independence of Greece and Romania. However, no military preparations were made to implement the guarantees, so they were meant to deter Mussolini and Hitler from moving against those countries. Romanian oil refineries and agriculatural produce would help Germany counter the effects of an allied naval blockade, while a Greece free of German domination was important for British forces and naval bases in the Mediterranean. The guarantees were meant to prevent German domination of these countries.\n\n5. Britain, France and the USSR - the Play for Germany.\n\nFrance was an ally of the Soviet Union since 1935 (ratified 1936), and the French government desperately wanted to turn this into a triple alliance with Britain on the lines of World War I. Chamberlain and his Cabinet distrusted Moscow but finally decided in late May to seek an alliance with the USSR in order to deter Hitler from aggression.\n\nStalin is known to have viewed Britain as the number one enemy of the USSR, so he distrusted British intentions but Foreign Commissar Maxim M Litivinov probably had a genuine desire for a Soviet alliance with London. Historians differ in their interpretations of Litvinov; some believe he worked for collective security in 1934-38 and then for a Soviet alliance with the Western Powers because this was Stalin's policy; others believe that Stalin really aimed at a deal with Hitler at least since 1935, if not earlier, and used Soviet apparent interest in collective security and later an alliance with France and Britain, in order to push Hitler into a deal with the USSR. Whatever the case may be, Stalin dismissed Litvinov in early May 1939 and some historians see this as indicating a step toward Soviet agreement with Germany. Indeed, a comparison of German foreign policy documents available in print since the 1950s, with Russian foreign policy documents published in 1992, indicates that in 1939 Stalin was far more interested in a nonaggression pact with Hitler - which he had suggested to Berlin in 1935 through Maxim Litvinov and in 1936 through his special envoy, David Kandelaki - than in a triple alliance with Britain and France.\n\nIt is true that the British at first wanted only a Soviet commitment to help Poland and Romania in case they were attacked by Germany, and this looked to Stalin like placing the whole burden on the USSR. Stalin also saw British guarantees to Poland and Romania as aimed against the USSR. (The two countries had a defensive alliance to support each other in case of a Soviet attack on either of them.) After a while, however, the British and French proved willing to negotiate an alliance and military convention with the Soviet Union. The sticking point in late summer 1939 was Moscow's insistence that the western powers accept its definition of \"indirect aggression,\" that is, the right to enter Estonia or/and Latvia, if the Soviets perceived that either country even changed its government and/or policy so as to threaten the USSR. What the Soviets had in mind was, of course, a German invasion of their territory through these countries, which signed nonaggression pacts with Germany in June. France and Britain proposed a far-reaching compromise in an exchange of letters, which would grant the Soviets what they wanted without putting this in the public text of the treaty, but this was not enough for Stalin.\n\nIn view of Russian claims, made in 2008-09, that Stalin had no choice but sign an agreement with Hitler in late August 1939, also that Poland had a secret agreement with Germany against the USSR signed in 1934, and that France and Britain wanted Hitler toattack the USSR, this whole issue needs to be set out clearly.\n\nFirst of all, Poland had signed a non-aggression treaty with the USSR in 1932, and after signing the Declaration of Non-Aggression with Germany in late January 1934, For. Mn. Beck travelled to Moscow in Feb. to sign a 10-year extension of the non-aggression treaty with the USSR. Secondly, there was no secret Polish-German agreement against the USSR. Thirdly, it is clear that Stalin was very interested in reaching an agreement with Germany.\n\nThe Soviet leader, in fact, authorized Georgii Astakhov, the Soviet charge d'affaires in Berlin . (Ambassador Merekalov left for Moscow in May, )to conduct secret talks with the Germans .* The ostensible goal of these talks was the renewal of the German-Soviet Trade Agreement of 1935 which had lapsed in 1938, and which was very important for the Russians. However, Astakhov kept on hinting at Soviet interest in a political agreement. In fact, Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav M. Molotov (1890-1986, Foreign Commissar May 1939-1955), first mentioned this interest to the German Ambassador in Moscow, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, in May, and confirmed it to him in early August. (Molotov succeeded Litvinov in early May, indicating a change of direction in Soviet policy. Litvinov was Jewish; therefore some foreign observers saw this as a move toward Berlin.)\n\n*[Georgii A. Astakhov,1897-1942, Soviet charge d'affaires in Berlin 1938-40; arrested in USSR, Dec.1939, he was either shot or died in a Soviet forced labor camp in 1942.]\n\nAside from the many secret indications of Soviet interest in a political agreement with Germany, there were also \"leaks\" of British and Franco-British proposals to Moscow. These documents were passed to the Soviet Embassy in London, which sent them on to the German Embassy there, which in turn telegraphed them immediately to Berlin. The documents were provided by a Soviet mole in the Foreign Office Code Room,Ret. Captain John - or John Herbert - King, an Irishman who hated the English and needed money. * This procedure of informing the Germans of British proposals indicates Soviet pressure on Berlin to come to an agreement with Moscow. At the same time, of course, it meant that Molotov always had advance notice of what the British ambassador, or the latter together with the French ambassador, was going to tell him.\n\n*[See: Donald Cameron Watt, \"Francis Herbert King. A Soviet Source in the Foreign Office,\" Intelligence and National Security, vol. III, no. 4., London, 1988, pp. 62-82. He is elsewhere named: John Herbert King].\n\nWe should also keep in mind that five highly placed British civil servants were Soviet \"moles\" in the British establishment. Among them was Kim Phliby, who was to become the head of British military intelligence, the MI5.\n\nThe British govt., for its part - especially Prime Minister Chamberlain --, was pursuing a policy of covert appeasment, and Stalin may well have known about it. In fact, there were some secret Anglo-German talks. These were leaked to the British press, where a report appeared on July 22, 1939. Chamberlains closest adviser at this time, Sir Horace Wilson, actually proposed to the Germans in early August that Britain and Germany conclude a non-aggression pact, after which Britain would drop her guarantees to Poland, Romania and Greece. (He may have done so in July, but no British document on this has survived.) However, Hitler sent no answer until he knew he would have a pact with the Soviets. He then insisted on having his demands on Poland met first, and only then entering into negotiations with Britain for a general settlement.\n\nIn early August, a Franco-British military delegation - or rather two delegations which worked together - set out for Leningrad (formerly and now again Petersburg) on a slow merchant ship.* This, plus the lack of a prominent British military or political figure with full powers, was criticized at the time and since as indicating a British lack of interest in the Soviet alliance. General Ironside, Inspector General of British armed forces, would have been the logical senior military figure to send, but he was ineligible because he had commanded British and Polish troops in northern Russia against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War (1918-21). The French delegation (France was already allied with the USSR in 1935) had full powers to negotiate, but the British did not.The British lack of full powers was due to the British government's assumption that a military alliance would be concluded when agreement was reached on the issue of \"indirect aggression\" (Soviet demands reg. Baltic States), or, if possible, that both be reached at the same time. Thus, Foreign Secretary Halifax could not have gone to Moscow without some basic agreement being reached first, but this was not the case. (When Ribbentrop went to Moscow later, basic agreement had been reached and only the details had to be worked out).\n\n*(The slow travel by ship, which is often criticized as foot dragging by the British and French,was due to the fact that the joint delegation could not travel by the most direct route to Russia, that is, through Germany (then Poland), while sending the delegation on a warship was considered \"provocative\" to Germany. Finally, the British navy only had two Sunderland Flying Boats at the time, and did not want to put them at risk.)\n\nIt can be argued that the British and French leaders were not really eager to undertake military obligations to the USSR. Indeed, they aimed above all at an alliance and military convention with Moscow in order to deter Hitler from attacking Poland and setting off a possible European war. However, these considerations are immaterial because in early August Molotov had already told the German Ambassador in Moscow that the Soviet government insisted on the conclusion of a political agreement, and, by the time the the Franco-British-Soviet talks began on August 12, Stalin knew that Hitler was willing to conclude an agreement with Moscow which recognized Soviet interests in East Central Europe, particularly in Poland.\n\nFurthermore, Stalins instructions to the head of the Soviet delegation, Marshal Kliment Y. Voroshilov (1881-1969), dated August 7, show great distrust of the British and French. He said that even if the western delegations revealed their countries military plans, Voroshilov was to demand the passage of Soviet troops through Poland Romania in case of war as the absolute Soviet condition for signing the alliance. *\n\n*[Dokumenty Vneshnei Politiki, 1939 god. Kniga 1, (Documents on Foreign Policy, the Year 1939, book 1,Moscow, 1992), doc. no. 453, p. 584]\n\nThis demand, which had not been raised earlier in Anglo-Soviet negotiations (proceeding since May), was made by Voroshilov at the first full meeting of the combined delegations on 12 August. When the Soviets suspended negotiations on 17 August --ostensibly to allow the Western Powers to secure Polish and French agreement to the entry of Soviet troops to Poland --the French and British representatives in Warsaw tried hard to get Polish agreement. The Polish government and high command refused, saying they did not believe the USSR would fight Germany, and that once Soviet troops entered Poland - they were unlikely to leave.\n\nIn any case, it is clear that Stalin and Molotov were determined to make a deal with Hitler, and the main points were agreed on two days earlier, on August 15. While the military talks with the French and British were suspended, Hitler asked Stalin to receive Ribbentrop by August 23, and Stalin agreed. On August 22, the German press announced the signature of the Soviet-German Trade Agreement, that the Nonaggression Pact would be signed the next day, and Ribbentrop would travel to Moscow. On the night of August 23, the Polish government said they would not oppose the discussion of the passage of Soviet troops by the general staffs in Moscow, but Ribbentrop was then negotiating with Stalin. Even if the Poles had agreed earlier, it is most unlikely that Stalin would have traded an agreement with Hitler for one with the Western Powers specifically to to help Poland if it was attacked by Germany. *\n\n*[ For a discussion of the diplomatic negotiations, secret talks, and Polish foreign policy in 1939, See Anna M.Cienciala, \"When did Stalin Decide to Align with Hitler and was Poland the Culprit?\", in M.B.B. Biskupski, ed.,Ideology, Politics and Diplomacy in East Central Europe, (University of Rochester Press, 2003), pp. 147-227].\n\nGerman documents show that the Secret Protocol to the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact was worked out at the Kremlin by Ribbentrop and Molotov and their aides during the night of August 23-24. They agreed that Poland would be divided down the middle, so that the Soviets would even have the right bank or eastern half of Warsaw (The city is divided by the Vistula river into left (eastern)and right (western) bank Warsaw.) Germany also recognized preponderant Soviet interest in the Baltic States of Finland, Estonia, and Latvia, with the northern frontier of Lithuania (that is, with Latvia) demarcating the German and Soviet spheres of interest in that region. The Germans also recognized Soviet interest in Bessarabia. [Part of the Russian Empire to 1918, then part of Romania, now Moldova].*\n\n*[Documents on German Foreign Policy, ser. D, vol. VII, London, Washington, 1956, doc. nos. 228,229. No Russian record of these negotiations has been published].\n\n[from R.Watt, Bitter Glory].\n\n[from: Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust. Note the two different German-Soviet lines of Aug. 23 and Sept. 28, 1939 in Poland and Lithuania.\n\nAll Soviet authorities denied the existence of the Secret Protocol until end December 1989, when it was disclosed that a \"verified copy\" had been found in the Soviet archives, and the Secret Protocol was condemned by the freely elected Supreme Soviet. The original Russian copy was \"found\" in the Kremlin Presidential Archives somewhat later. Only the Non-Aggression Pact was known in 1939, but it shocked world opinion, especially communist party leaders outside the USSR who had been propagating the anti-fascist line.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Aug. 23 German-Soviet \"demarcation line\" in Poland (including the addition of the Pisa river) was actually shown on a map printed in the Soviet paper Pravda [Truth] on 23 September 1939 (see below), probably as a reminder to the Germans, who had already gone east of it. Interestingly enough, in the Secret Protocol Stalin was willing to leave Lithuania to Germany. In the Soviet-German Treaty of Sept. 28, Hitler recognized Soviet dominant interest in almost all of Lithuania. In exchange, Stalin gave up a part of Poland gained in the Secret Protocol and agreed to pay Germany several million dollars.\n\nThe German-Soviet \"demarcation line\" in Poland (according to the Secret Protocol of Aug.23, 1939, amended on September 22 to include the Pisa river).\n\nPravda, Sept. 23, 1939.\n\nWhen the Nazi-Soviet Pact gave Hitler a free hand to attack the Poles, the British government decided to conclude a Mutual Assistance Treaty with Poland, signed in London on August 25. The timing of the signature, 5 p.m., was set to coincide with the delivery of a letter from Mussolini to Hitler - which the British ambassador in Rome had encouraged him to send - saying that Italy was not ready for a war with the Western Powers unless it received enormous amounts of raw materials and arms from Germany. The combination of the treaty and the letter made Hitler cancel his orders, given on August 23, for an attack on Poland to start on August 26. However, the cancellation failed to reach a German unit on the Polish-Slovak border, so it got into a fire fight with the Poles and retreated.\n\nChamberlain and his Cabinet saw the treaty with Poland as a deterrent to Hitler, for they still hoped for a negotiated German-Polish agreement granting Hitler what he wanted. Therefore, Birger Dahlerus, a Norwegian businessman and friend of Goering, shuttled secretly between London and Berlin in late August. His mission was to persuade Goering and Hitler to work for such a result. It was even agreed that Goering would pay a secret visit to England, but Hitler cancelled it when he had the agreement with Stalin in hand.\n\nOn August 27, Chamberlain told the Cabinet that Poland could at most accept the return of Danzig to Germany and a German extra-territorial highway and railway through the Corridor. He said this despite the fact that the Polish government had always viewed this solution as unacceptable. Therefore, Chamberlain was expressing his opinion, and not that of Britains ally.\n\nHitler made an apparent ploy for peace, but German armed forces had orders to attack Poland on September 1, so his aim was to place the blame for war on the Poles. At midnight on August 29, Ribbentrop quickly read to the British Ambassador, Sir Nevile Henderson, a list of terms for Poland which would allegedly ensure peace. Danzig was to return to Germany but Poland would keep its rights there; there was to be a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor, but all Poles who were born or settled there since early 1919 would have no vote, while all Germans born, even if not living there, would. (Hitler did not seem to realize that there was a Polish majority in this region according to the Prussian census of 1910, see Lec. Notes 11, The Rebirth of Poland). Poland would have guaranteed access to the sea. There would be an exchange of minority populations between the two countries. If Poland accepted these terms, Germany would agree to the British offer of an international guarantee, but this would now include the Soviet Union. A Polish plenipotentiary (with full powers) was to arrive in Berlin to accept these terms by noon the next day.\n\nThe British Cabinet thought the terms were \"reasonable,\" except the demand for a Polish Plenipotentiary which was too much like the Czech President Hacha accepting Hitlers terms in mid-March 1939; they feared outrage in British public opinion. The British government had asked the Poles a few days earlier if they were ready to negotiate, to which Beck said yes -- providing the terms were not contrary to vital Polish interests, (which were: Danzig to continue to exist as a Free City, and the Polish Corridor to continue to be part of Poland).\n\nAt this time, on August 29-31, the Sir Nevile Henderson exerted great pressure on Polish Ambassador Jozef Lipski to accept Hitlers offer. It is clear from British documents, that Henderson acted in agreement with Halifax, though he exceeded his brief because he was openly in sympathy with German demands. Sir Horace Wilson -- who shared their views -- told him to be careful on the phone because it was bugged by the Germans.\n\nIn Warsaw, the British and French Ambassadors now pressed the Polish government not to proclaim mobilization -- which was viewed as having triggered World War in 1914. The Polish government agreed, but proceeded to mobilization by mail (post cards). When Ambassador Lipski went to see Ribbentrop on August 30, he was presented with Hitlers demands. Ribbentrop asked the Ambassador if he had full powers to sign. When Lipski said he had come to receive the German terms, Ribbentrop ended the meeting. The German radio then broadcast Hitler's demands with the comment that Poland had rejected them.*\n\n*[For an account of these events, focusing on British and French policy, see: Anna M. Cienciala, \"Poland in British and French Policy in 1939...\" in Finney, cited earlier].\n\nIt is clear that the conclusion of the Nazi-Soviet Pact removed any fears Hitler may have had about risking a European war by attacking Poland, and this seems to put the onus on Stalin. Some historians have claimed-- as is the official Russian position today, August 2009 -- that Stalin had no other choice because he had to obtain security for the USSR, which faced the Germans in the West and was fighting the Japanese in the Far East. This is the line followed by some Russian historians and most Russian media today, along with charging Polish For. Minister Beck with following a pro-German policy in 1939; some media even charge him with being a paid Germana agent. These charges are designed to show that Stalin had no choice but to go with Hitler; there is no explanation how and why a pro-German Beck, or as a German agent, rejected Hitler's demands and secured first, a British guarantee of Polish indeepence, and then an alliance with Britain.\n\n. Russian TV showed a film on Aug. 23,2009, claiming that Poland was in cahoots with Hitler and had even planned to attack the USSR in tandem with Germany and Japan (!). The film also claims that Poland had a secret agreement with Hitler, attached to the Jan. 26 1934 Polish-German Declaration of Non-Aggression, valid for ten years.There was no such secret protocol. On the contrary, Poland had signed a Non-Aggression Treaty with the USSR in July 1932 and Foreign Minister Jozef Beck travelled to Moscow in Feb. 1934, where he signed a 10-year extension of the treaty.\n\nThe USSR did not offer an alliance to Poland in 1939. Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar V. Potemkin, told Beck on May 10 that the Soviet Union would observe benevolent neutrality in case of war. The Soviet ambassador, Sharonov, also stated around this time that Moscow would consider asssistance to Poland if the latter asked for it. These statements were not equivalent to the offer of an alliance to Poland, as some historians claim.\n\nAnother argument used by pro-Kremlin authors is that of Soviet security. They assumes that it would be strenthened by the seizure of eastern Poland and later the Baltic States so Stalin must have aimed to control the main access routes into the USSR: the northern route through the Baltic States and the southern route through western Ukraine, then S.E. Poland; the Polesie marshes lay inbetween. (The the Soviet government drained the marshes after World War II.) In fact, however, the new German-Soviet frontier of Sept. 28 1939 brought German armies that much closer to Moscow (see Piotrowski map above). The Germans regained former eastern Poland in about two weeks in June-July 1941, while also overunning the Baltic States. If they had attacked a couple of weeks earlier, Hitler might have held a victory parade in Moscow. Stalin had done nothing since occupying eastern Poland in September 1939, to prepare for the defense of these territories. His worst error was refusing to believe the warnings sent by Churchill and Roosevelt in spring and summer 1941, also his man in Tokyo, Richard Sorge, that Hitler was prepring to attack the USSR. We may assume he rejected these warnings because they did not fit his timetable for Soviet readiness to fight Hitler, or/and he may have believed Hitler would not risk such a war. We do not, however. know what Stalin was thinking because theRussian documents, which might clarify the issue, remain inaccessible in Russian archives.\n\nIt should be mentioned, that Soviet military intelligence reported in late 1938 that Hitler was planning to attack Poland next, and that his main goal was the destruction of the USSR.But no such warnings came in 1939. As it happened, Hitler turned against Czechsoslovakia, then Poland, but Stalin may have expected Poland to accept Hitler's demands and become a willing satellite of Germany in an attack on the USSR.\n\nThe most balanced Russian statements on the whole issue were made by Vladimir Ryzhkov (b.1966), who had represented Barnaul, (Siberia) in the Duma in 1993-2007. He became head of the Republican Party of Russia, which was refused registration for the elections of 2005. Ryzhkov sees responsibility for the outbreak of the war as shared by France and Britain, although the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact also played a major role. Nevertheless, the main responsibility if, of course, Hitler's.*\n\n*(For Ryzhkov's statements on the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, see \"Detrimental Denial,\" Moscow News, no.32, 2009. Ryzhkov is now professor at the Higher School for Economics, and chairman of the political organisation \"Russia's Choice.\").\n\nJust ahead of the 70th anniversary of the German attack on Poland in 1939, and on the eve of his own visit to Gdansk, along with other statesmen for the celebrations, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin wrote an Open Letter to the Polish people, printed in Gazeta Wyborcza, Aug. 31, 2009. He stated that the Russian Duma had condemned the Secret Protocol to that Pact in Dec. 1989, and it was, of course, immoral. He pointed out, however, that the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact should not be seen as causing the outbreak of WW II. He said that the roots of the war went back further, and pointed out the Munich Agreement of Sept. 28, 1938, in which France and Britain had agreed to the cession of part of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland, to Germany, while Poland took a part of Czechoslovakia (western Cieszyn/Teschen Silesia). He mentioned the sad fate of Soviet prisoners of war in Poland in 1920 *and also mentioned the Versailles Treaty of 1919 ( a hint at German resentment of losing Danzig and the Polish Corridor to East Prussia). He also recalled that Poland had annexed a piece of Czechoslovakia in fall 1938.**\n\n*[NOTE by Cienciala: Out of 100,000 Soviet Prisoners in Polish captivity in 1920, Polish and Soviet historians agreed that 16-18,000 died of malnutrition and hunger (Russ. lang. book on Red Army Men in Polish Capitivity, 1919-1920, published Moscow, 2004). About 40,000 returned home to Russia, while the rest either joined anti-Bolshevik forces or found some kind of a living in Poland. While the Polish camp commanders can be charged with not providing enough food and medication to the prisoners, we should note that in 1920 there was general malnutrition as well as a typhoid epidemic in Poland. Herbert Hoover's American Relief Administration (ARA) saved the lives of thousands of Polish children. The ARA also saved many lives in Russia, where famine raged at this time.]\n\nAdam Michnik, the founder and editor-in -chief of Gazeta Wyborcza, answered Putin in the same newspaper. He welcomed Putin's conciliatory statements and hope for better Polish-Russian relations. He also pointed out, however, that while the Polish annexation of (disputed) Czech territory was immoral, the new Polish administration there did not shoot or deport any Czechs in that area (as the Soviets did to Poles and others in Eastern Poland, 1919-41). As for the Soviet prisoners of war in Poland in 1920.Michnik stressed the fact that none of them had been shot in the back of the head. ***\n\nPutin's speeach on Sept. 1, 2009, at the meeting of of several European leader in Gdansk,was much shorter and more conciliatory to Poland Polish Premier Tusk spoke in the same spirit.\n\n** As for the Versailles Treaty solutions of the Free City of Danzig and the award of the predominantly Polish Pomerania (Corridor) to Poland, these were compromises fair to both sides. Of course , the Germans resented the separation of East Prussia from Germany, but the predominantly Polish population of the Corridor could not be put back under German rule. Communication with Germany was assured by six trains crossing the Corridor every day while most of the bulk trade went by sea, as it had done before the World War I.. It should also be noted that all German governments before Hitler -- and at first, Hitler as well -- demanded revision of the German-Polish frontier, which meant not only the return of Danzig and the Corridor but all of former Prussian Poland to Germany. Hitler at least put these demands on the back burner by agreeing to the Polish-German Declaration of Non-Aggression of Jan. 26, 1934. See Lec. Notes 14a.]\n\nAs for the date of the Soviet attack on eastern Poland , Sept. 17, if Stalin waited to see whether the French Army would attack Germany in the West, it was clear by Sept. 16 that it would not do so. He ordered the attack to take place on Sept.13, but postponed it to Sept. 17 on being assured by the Germans that they were about to take Warsaw. (In fact, it surrendered on Sept.27.)\n\nAs for the Japanese-Soviet conflict in the Far East, it may have been a factor in Stalin's policy before 23As August 1939, but by that time the Japanese forces involved in the Nomonhan area were being beaten back by Army Commander (later Marshal) Georgy Zhukov, and an armistice was signed on Sept. 16. Furthermore, the Soviet mole in Tokyo, Richard Sorge (1895-1944), informed Stalin in summer 1939, on the basis of his contacts with high Japanese officials, that Japan would not be ready for war for another two years, and it was not planning to attack the USSR. (The Japanese finally arrested Sorge, but Stalin refused Tokyos's offers of exchaning him for some Japanese officers, so he was executed in 1944.)\n\nSome historians believe that Stalins decision to line up with Hitler was most likely based on an alleged key assumption of Soviet policy: that a war between the capitalist powers would lead to their mutual exhaustion and therefore pave the way to the establishment of communist governments in Europe, presumably under Soviet control. Indeed, one can deduce as much from Stalin's statement to Georgii Dimitrov, head of the Comintern (Communist International) on Sept. 17. According to Dimitrov's diary, in early Steptember Stalin said the longer France and Britain fought Germany, the better, and he would help both sides. Also, Poland was a fascist state which oppressed the Ukrainians and Belarusians and there was nothing wrong with gaining territory for the USSR and expanding Socialism. *\n\n*(Diary of Georgii Dimitrov, 1933-1948, introd. by Ivo Banac, (Yale Univ. Press, 2003), entry for Sept. 7, 1939.).\n\nAs for the argument that the Ukrainians and Belarusians suffered under Polish rule, there is no doubt that they resented it, but Soviet rule was much worse. Stalin forced collectivization on Soviet peasants and used famine to break resistance in Soviet Ukraine in 1932-33. This led to the death of an estimated 5 million Ukrainians. There was famine in other parts of the USSR, but nowhere was it as dreadful as in Ukraine. Many peasants, who lived on the Soviet side of the border, fled to Poland.\n\nWe do know that Stalin was shocked by the rapid defeat of France in May-June 1940. He seems to have expected a longer stand off . Of course, in the short run the USSR would profit by gaining territory which could be viewed as a buffer against German attack. but it proved not to be such in 1941. Indeed, Stalin did not make use of the time he had to strengthen hist western defenses against Germany. On the contrary, he ordered the destruction of the old Soviet fortifications on the former Polish-Soviet border, which would at least have held up some German forces, and he did not build any new ones. Was he perhaps thinking of removing obstacles to a future Soviet attack on Germany? No one can give absolutely sure answers to questions about Stalin's policy in 1939 because the relevant Russian documents are still inaccessible to historians.\n\n6. The German Attack on Poland and the Outbreak of World War II.\n\nOn September 1, 1939, several German armies attacked Poland from the West, North and South-West. To justify this aggression, German propaganda faked a Polish \"attack\" on the radio station in the Upper Silesian town of Gleiwitz (now Gliwice, Poland) , and this was broadcast to the world. (After the war, it was found that the SS - Security Police - had used German political prisoners dressed in Polish uniforms, and murdered them after the \"attack\" to eliminate witnesses. The sturdy, wooden radio tower still stands in Gliwice toda).\n\nThe French and British governments delivered warning notes in Berlin on September 1, stating that if the German army did not withdraw from Poland, they would immediately fulfill their obligations to that country. At the same time, however, the British government encouraged Mussolini to propose a great power conference, this time including Poland, and the French government supported this move. On September 2, Mussolini informed the British that he was trying to get Hitler's consent, but thought he was unlikely to withdraw his forces from Poland unless he first got what he wanted. Mussolini also said that Hitler asked for time until midnight September 3, to answer Mussolinis proposal. Meanwhile, German armed forces continued their attack on Poland.\n\nThe British Cabinet met at 4 p.m. September 2. Halifax reported Mussolinis information and proposed the deadline for Hitlers answer to the British and French notes be set at midnight September 3. The Cabinet decided for midnight the same day, Sept. 2, but left the \"coordination\" of French and British action to Halifax.\n\nThat evening, September 2, Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons and Halifax in the House of Lords.They stated that if German forces withdrew from Poland, then the British government would treat the situation as if nothing had happened, and would support Polish-German negotiations, or a wider conference. They did not give a deadline for Hitlers answer to the British note.\n\nThe staid House of Lords, which respected Halifax, heard him out in silence -- but there was uproar in the House of Commons. Chamberlain was told that he must report to the House the next day by 11 a.m. There was a revolt in the Cabinet too. Therefore, on the night of September 2, Chamberlain told the French government that Britain had to act, and instructed Ambassador Henderson to deliver a note to Ribbentrop the next day at 9 a.m. demanding an answer by 11 a.m. Henderson did so, and the French ambassador delivered a note demanding an answer by 5 p.m.\n\nWhen there was no answer from Hitler by 11 a.m. Setp 3, Chamberlain spoke on the radio stating that Britain was at war with Germany. The French government stated the same at 5 p.m. Thus, the German attack on Poland and Polish resistance brought about the outbreak of World War II.\n\n7. The German-Polish War, September 1 - October 5, 1939.\n\nThe Polish General Staff, government and the Polish people expected Britain and France, especially the latter, go give them military aid, as per their agreements, by attacks against Germany in the West. However, Poland received no help from the its allies. The French manned the Maginot Line and made a few probing forays into West Germany, after which they withdrew. General Maurice Gamelin (1872-1958), Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces, told the British on September 12, that he had ordered the withdrawal of French forces from Germany [small forces had gone a few miles forward], and that he would not attack Germany even if the Poles resisted for three months -- because their task was to gain time for France. *\n\n*[For source, see Cienciala in Finney, cit above.]\n\nThe French and British had about 1,600 first line planes against 600 German planes in the West; they had 2,600 tanks against some 850 -- while about 1,600 were in Poland. About 100 French divisions faced 26-30 German divisions, most of them manned by reservists; and the Siegfried Line -- the German defense line in the west-- was still unfinished. The two powers, had, however, agreed to be on the defensive if Germany attacked Poland; they did not tell the Poles.\n\nThe Poles had about 400 planes, most of them outdated, facing 1,800 German planes. They had about 300 light, French-made tanks facing about 1,600 German tanks. A German warship pounded the Polish munitions depot at Westerplatte -- just north of Danzig harbor-- where the Polish garrison fought gallantly for 12 days. Other warships were pounding Polish defenses on the tiny Hel peninsula west of Gdynia; the fortifications there were the last to surrender to the Germans.\n\nThe German airforce did not destroy most of the Polish planes on the ground, as is often stated in books about this war. In fact, they had been camouflaged or moved elsewhere to prevent this from happening. Most of these planes -- which were outdated in any case --were destroyed in air battles. The German airforce did, however, wreak havoc with the Polish rail and road network. It also attacked undefended towns and villages. Indeed, Hitler had given orders to German airmen that they were to show no mercy to the Polish population. The Polish government appealed to the British to bomb Germany, but Lord Halifax finally told Polish Ambassador Edward Raczynski that this would not be done, and Poland must wait for allied victory.\n\nIn fact, British planes carried out one raid on the German naval base at Wilhelmshafen, and made a few desultory sorties over the Ruhr. They did no more than that, so people thought this was to avoid German retaliation against London. In fact, British and German air force experts knew that German bombers could not do carry havy bombs to London, unless they flew from airfields in western France - as they were to do in the Battle of Britain, 1940-41.\n\nThe Polish defense plan seemed strategically absurd: the Polish army was to try and hold the whole length of the German-Polish frontier and retreat slowly when forced to do so. But the Polish General Staff had two reasons for this strategy;(a) they feared that giving up Western Poland with its industry and Polish population in order to hold a defensible line on the Vistula, might lead Hitler to offer peace negotiations to France and Britain , which might recognize his conquests; (b) the Franco-Polish military protocols of May 19, 1939, stipulated that the Polish armed forces were to delay the German advance along the whole front line until the French army was ready to attack Germany in the West, that is, on the 16th day after the start of the German attack (15 days for mobilization). The French airforce was to bomb Germany. However, as stated earlier, the French had no intention to do so, or to launch an offensive against Germany, so Poland was left to fight alone.\n\nFinally, the retreating Polish High Command planned to regroup its forces in south-eastern Poland, near Romania, which was expected to receive French and British arms and planes to pass on to the Poles. These plane, however, became inoperative once the USSR attacked Poland on Sept. 17.\n\n[pictures and captions from: R.Watt, Bitter Glory - The Marshal is shown at a parade, wearing a winter coat and sporting a dress saber].\n\n7.The Soviet attack on Poland.\n\nThe Red Army entered eastern Poland on September 17. Stalin and Molotov had resisted German pleas to march into Poland after the German attack began, but it is clear from Russian documents (available in 1989-90) that although the Soviet western military districts of Minsk and Kiev were mobilized and the original orders were for them to attack on 9 September, the attack was postponed to September 17.\n\nNo reason is documented for the delay. It may be that Stalin was waiting for an agreement with the Japanese to end the fighting in the Far East, and this took place on September 13 with the armistice signed three days later. Or he may have waited to see what the French and British would do, particularly the French, would attack Germany in the West; or he waited for the fall of Warsaw to the Germans. Also, there were no signs of preparations for a French offensive against Germany.\n\nThere was some difficulty in agreeing on the text of the Soviet declaration justifying the Soviet move. German and Russian documents show that Molotov at first proposed a statement saying the Red Army was coming in to save its Ukrainian and Belorussian brothers from the Germans, but this was unacceptable to the Berlin so it was later changed to giving them security and the Polish people the chance for a happier life (!) Finally, when the Germans informed Moscow on Sept. 16 that Warsaw was about to be fall (it did not), Stalin and Molotov informed the German Ambassador at 2 a.m. on September 17 that the Red Army would enter Poland at 6 a.m. that day.\n\nThe Polish Ambassador in Moscow, Waclaw Grzybowski (1887-1959, ambassador in Moscow 1937-39), was handed a note at 3 a.m. on September 17 by Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir P. Potemkin (1874-1946), who had summoned him to his office. The note, drawn up by Molotov and sent also to all foreign diplomatic representatives in Moscow, stated that since Warsaw had surrendered and the Polish government had ceased to exist (neither of which was true), the Soviet government considered its treaties with Poland as no longer in force. The ambassador refused to accept the note, but it was delivered to the embassy while he was talking with Potemkin. He informed the Polish government which, together with the diplomatic corps, was by this time on the Polish-Romanian frontier. (The information was sent via the Polish Embassy in Bucharest.)*\n\nAt first, some in the Polish government and military thought the Russians might be coming to help Poland, but very soon it was clear this was not the case. Therefore, the Polish government -- then located almost on the Polish-Romanian frontier, with Romania over the bridge on the Dniester River -- decided to cross into Romania with the intention of proceeding to France and continuing the fight from there. In fact, the French ambassador supported this plan, while the head of the French military mission, General Faury, persuaded the Polish Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Edward Smigly-Rydz (sometimes called Rydz-Smigly), not to stay and fight to the death in Poland as he intended, but proceed through Romania to France and build a new Polish army there. All this was not public knowledge, however, so the government and the commander-in-chief were condemned by German and Soviet propaganda, as well as by Polish public opinion, for abandoning the Polish people while Polish army units were still fighting the Germans.\n\nAs it happened, the chief ministers of the government and Rydz-Smigly were interned by the Romanians, who did so under heavy German pressure. Nevertheless, they allowed President Ignacy Moscicki to leave for Switzerland. (He had worked there as a scientist before World War I and had dual Polish and Swiss citizenship.) Also, thousands of Polish military were allowed to make their way, mostly through Yugoslavia and Italy (which gave Poles reduced group fares on the Italian railways to spite the Germans) to join the new Polish army in France. Hungary also allowed this to happen, so that about 35,000 Polish military reached France and formed a new army there, along with 20,000 Polish immigrants (mostly coal miners), already living in France. A new Polish government was formed in Paris on September 30, 1939, with General Wladyslaw Sikorski * as Premier - and soon also Commander-in-Chief of Polish armed forces - and Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz ** as President. The former Polish government remained interned in Romania and For. Min. Jozef Beck died there on 5 June 1944, a day before the D-Day Allied landings in north-west France.\n\n* [Wladyslaw Sikorski, 1881-1943, Premier 1922-23, War Minister 1923-24, in the opposition after Pilsudskis coup of May 1926. Died in an air crash off Gibraltar on July 4, 1943.]\n\n** [Wladyslaw Raczkiewicz, 1885-1947, held various ministerial and adm. posts in interwar Poland; President of the Polish government-in-exile, London, 1939-47.]\n\nMarshal Rydz-Smigly, before crossing to Romania, issued an order to Polish forces not to fight the Russians unless the latter tried to disarm them, also for Polish soldiers and officers to make for Romania and Hungary. This order reached some units but not others. In fact, there were some pitched battles with the Red Army, but for the most part Polish soldiers surrendered to the Russians -- who had orders to prevent any Polish forces leaving the country for Romania and Hungary. The Polish commander in Lwow (now Lviv), General Wladyslaw A. Langner (1897-1972) chose to surrender to the Russians rather than the Germans, who were encircling the city but withdrew as the Red Army advanced. His representatives signed an agreement with the representatives of Komandarm [Marshal] Semyon K. Timoshenko (1895-1970), that he and his men would be set free. However, they were taken prisoner and sent to the NKVD concentration camp in Starobelsk, eastern Ukraine. (Langner himself was allowed to travel to Moscow, where he pleaded for the release of his men. He was promised that they would be freed, but on returning to Lwow found they were not, so he decided to cross the border into Romania and joined the Polish army in the West.)\n\nOf the Polish prisoners estimated at 250,000 or more, most of the rank-and-file, also NCOs from former eastern Poland (now western Ukraine and western Belarus) were sent home, but the officers were selected out and sent either to Starobelsk, south-east of Kharkov (now Kharkiv) in Ukraine, or to a another concentration camp, Kozelsk, south of Smolensk in western Russia.. Police, gendarmes, some officers, also some civilians - mainly employed in law courts - were sent to Ostashkov, just north of Smolensk. (See map of concentration camps in Lec. Notes. 16B). About 40,000 rank-and-file soldiers who came from German-occupied Poland, were delivered later to German authorities. In exchange, the Germans gave the Soviet authorities their Ukrainian and Belorussian prisoners who had served in the Polish Army.\n\n8. Polish Defeat.\n\nThe Poles fought bravely against greatly superior German forces. The biggest battle of the campaign was the Battle of the Bzura River, in central Poland, where the Poles fought the Germans for several days.\n\n[from: Steven J. Zaloga and Victor Madaj, The Polish Campaign,1939, New York, 1985. Note the two, horse-drawn light artillery pieces on the left and right of the cavalry. They were used as anti-tank guns].\n\nPoland was an economically underdeveloped country in 1939, so it did not have a modern army, hough it had a few up-to-date bombers and one armored brigade.\n\nThe Polish cavalry was used as a mobile force and never attacked German tanks, as claimed in some history books. This legend probably originated from the fact that in one place, when surrounded by tanks, cavalrymen charged between them to escape. Some Italian journalists reported cavalry charges against tanks and the Germans made a propaganda film showing Polish cavalry charging tanks to show Polish recklessness. However, if one looks closely, the cavalrymen are wearing German helmets (!) Some Polish propaganda officials in London decided to present this myth as a fact, thinking the British would be impressed with Polish courage. Instead, of course, they thought the Poles to be foolish. The myth lives on in some history books to this day as an example of Polish romantic recklessness.\n\nWarsaw surrendered on September 27 - on orders from Marshal Rydz-Smigly brought by an officer who flew from Romania and landed in Warsaw. In any case, after a three week German siege from land and air there was no more food or water in the city. The last Polish unit fighting the Germans was dissolved by its commander at Kock on October 5. Thus, the Poles had fought the Germans for five weeks,about as long as the much better armed French and British fought them in May-June 1940. The Germans took about 500,000 Polish prisoners; released many of the rank-and-file and placed the officers in special camps. Most of these prisoners survived the war.\n\nDavid Low Cartoon [Britain, September 1939].\n\n[from: An Atlas of Russian History. The map does not show the original demarcation line which went through Warsaw itself; see Piotrowski map above.]\n\nIn the German-Soviet Friendship and Frontier Treaty, signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov in Moscow on September 28, 1939. Stalin gave up some territory in Poland in exchange for Soviet dominant interest in the whole of Lithuania - except for Memel which would stay with Germany and Wilno (now Vilnius), which was to go to Lithuania. He also agreed to pay Hitler several million dollars in gold. The new German-Soviet frontier in Poland, which was similar to the Curzon Line, came to be known as the Ribbentrop-Molotov Line, although the line of August 23, which cut Poland in half, deserves to be called the first line with this name. ( See the Piotrowski map of Poland 1939-41 above, shown under the photo of the signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact).\n\nA secret protocol to the treaty of 28 September 1939, specified German-Soviet cooperation against any Polish attempts at resistance.* Several meetings between the Gestapo and the NKVD are known to have taken place in German-occupied Poland. No records have been found, but clearly agreements were reached on cooperation against Polish resistance of any kind.\n\n[* \"Both parties will tolerate in their territories no Polish agitation which affects the territories of the other parties. They will suppress in their territories all beginnings of such agitation and inform each other concerning suitable measures for this purpose.,\" Documents on German Foreign Policy, ser. D, vol. VIII, Washington, London, 1956, doc. no. 160].\n\nGerman Losses in Poland.\n\nThe Germans lost about one sixth of their front line planes and about one quarter of their tanks, plus armored cars and some 15,000 dead in the war with Poland; the Poles lost about 60,000 men. The Germans expended all their bomb stocks. It was these losses, and not just the weather, that made Hitler decide not to attack France in October, as he had planned.* The Germans took about 450,000 prisoners, whom they placed in POW camps, divided into officer and regular camps.\n\n* [see: Steven J. Zaloga nad Victor Madaj, The Polish Campaign, 1939, New York, 1985].\n\nGerman occupation policies.\n\nThe Germans immediately began to arrest and shoot prominent Poles, also all those with higher education (\"Operation Tannenberg.\"). There was also a violent German \"reprisal\" for an alleged Polish massacre of German civilians in Bydgoszcz [pron, Bydgoshch, formerly Bromberg] called \"Bloody Sunday\" by German propaganda. Polish civilians were massacred in reprisal.\n\nMost Polish historians claim that some Germans had shot at retreating Polish troops, while the Germans denied it. It was only recently that Polish researchers found German Military Intelligence (Abwehr) documents in the German Military Archive, Freiburg, showing there was a 150 member German civilian battle-sabotage group in Bydgoszcz, which attacked Polish military units retreating from the city on 3-4 September, provoking Polish reprisals.A study on this subject was to be published by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance in 2008.* The Germans shot several hundred Poles in revenge.\n\n*[\"Historycy wytropili dywersantow,\" (Historians traced and found the Diversionists), Gazeta Wyborcza, Warsaw, Sept. 5, 2007. On German atrocities against Polish civilians during and after the campaign, see Alexander B. Rossino, Hitler Strikes Poland. Blitzkrieg, Ideology, and Atrocity, Lawrence, KS., 2003.]\n\nConclusion.\n\nPolands lone fight gained precious time for the Western Powers, a time used well by the British who were producing 600 fighters a month. The French, however, produced far fewer planes. Their military leaders also disregarded the lessons of the German \"Blitzkrieg\" in Poland -- they said it could not happen in France -- and did not change their war plans accordingly.\n\nPolish troops fought the Germans in Norway in spring 1940 and in France in May-June 1940. The Polish government escaped to Britain when France was falling in June 1940, and about 20,000 Polish military managed to make their way there while some were interned in Switzerland. Of those who reached Britain, the most important were Polish airmen who fought in the Battle of Britain. (Some came by sea from Romania, registered as Jewish refugees going to British Palestine !) After September 15, when these airmen were allowed to fly and fight (the British had feared communication difficulties since most of the Poles did not know English), they made up 10% of RAF pilots and racked up many kills, specially Squadron. 303, which became famous, even though the pilot with the most kills was a Czech. (The Czechs were also fighting in the RAF at this time.) From June 1940 until the USSR came into the war in June 1941, the Polish military were the only armed force actively fighting on the British side against Germany.\n\n[For Poland under German and Soviet occupation, see 16B, part. II].\n\n*********************\n\nLECTURE NOTES 16B. Eastern Europe in World War II: October 1939-May 1945.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nAs discussed above, World War II was sparked by the German attack on Poland and by Polish resistance to this attack.\n\nPoland had the largest underground movement in Europe, with the anti-communist Home Army [Armia Krajowa - A.K] being the largest after Tito's communist-led Partisans. (The Armia Krajowa had 400,000 soldiers in August 1944, while Tito's Partisans numbered about 800,000 in 1945). Poland was also the only German-occupied country which had a fully developed underground administration, known as the \"Underground State,\" which recognized the Polish government-in-exile located first in France, then in Britain. Finally, the most contentious issue in Western-Soviet - mostly British-Soviet - relations in WW II --- was the future Polish-Soviet frontier. Therefore, the focus of these lecture notes will be on Poland. However, first there will be a brief survey of the war in the rest of Eastern Europe. (On Poland see III)...\n\nAfter Poland, the next E. European country to fight the fascist powers was Greece. Italian forces invaded Greece from Albania at the end of October 1940. British reinforcements landed in Crete and other Greek islands, and British planes bombed Italian warships at Taranto. (The Russians also sent some planes to help the Greeks). However, most of the fighting was done by the Greeks, who broke through Italian lines in Albania and occupied part of that country.\n\nGreece was isolated because Romania and Bulgaria soon joined the Axis or Tripartite Pact signed by Germany, Italy and Japan on September 27, 1940, and Yugoslavia signed it on March 25, 1941. However, a coup organized in Belgrade by Serbian officers, with British support, overthrew the Regent, Prince Paul, and his government on March 26-28, 1941, and the almost 18-year old Peter (born 1923), was proclaimed King as Peter II.\n\nThe new government did not want to provoke Hitler, and proclaimed Yugoslav neutrality. When it hesitated to grant the German army transit to Greece, German planes bombed Belgrade on April 6 1941 causing great civilian casualties, while German troops poured in and overran the country. Of course, Belgrade crowds had demonstrated to show they were anti-German, so the code name for the German attack on the city was \"Punishment.\" The USSR, which had just signed an alliance with Yugoslavia, quickly backed out. King Peter and his government were evacuated to Britain. [For Yugoslavia, 1941-45, see below].\n\nAt the same time as their attack on Yugoslavia, the Germans invaded Greece. The Greeks -- who had pushed invading Italian forces back into Albania -- were beaten by the Germans, signed an armistice on April 23, 1940 and King George II left the country for Britain. A British Expeditionary Force of 60,000 managed to save most of its men, but lost much valuable equipment. Moreover, German forces parachuted into Crete destroying part of the British forces there and forcing the evacuation of the rest. Greece suffered heavy population losses under the German occupation, mostly by starvation. Greek Jews were deported to Nazi death camps in German-occupied Poland.*\n\n*[For the German occupation of Greece, see Mark Mazower, Inside Hitlers Greece. The Experience of Occupation 1941-1944, New Haven, CT., 1993].\n\nGreek resistance was mostly carried out by the communist-led National Liberation Front (Greek acronym, EAM) and its armed forces, (Greek acronym, ELAS), although there was also a republican resistance movements (Greek acronym: EDES), which was supported by Britain and received the largest share of supplies. Churchill supported the restoration of the Greek monarchy under King George II, whose exile government was located in Cairo, under British protection. FDR also supported George II, although both British and American experts warned their governments that most Greeks opposed the restoration of the monarchy. However, Churchill believed that only the return of George II to the throne could mobilize Greek opposition to a communist takeover of Greece. Churchill also aimed to get Stalin's agreement to stay out of Greece - always seen as a key British ally in the Mediterranean.\n\nIn October 1944, Churchill went to Moscow (his second trip there, the first being in Aug. 1942,) and proposed a division of influence in the Balkans. Stalin agreed and they concluded the \"Percentage Agreement,\" whereby Stalin recognized Britain as having 90% influence in Greece, while Churchill recognized the USSR as having 90% influence in Romania and Bulgaria. They were to share 50-50% influence in Hungary and Yugoslavia. [See II 4 D below].\n\nIn late December 1944 the Germans withdrew form Greece and British forces landed in Athens followed by Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden who both arrived on Christmas Day 1944. Greek Communist leaders seemed to accept the temporary government of Archbishop Damaskinos as Regent, but a Civil War broke out in 1946 and lasted until 1949, when the Communists lost. Stalins policy in this period was generally in keeping with the October 1944 agreement with Churchill, but it it is known that Czechoslovak arms reached the Greek communists through Bulgaria (both countries were under Soviet control). It is also known that in 1947, the Soviet Politburo supported the plans of the Greek communists to capture part of the country with Saloniki as the communist capital. Ultimately, Stalin seems to have decided that it was better to avoid antagonizing Britain and the US over Greece and the communists lost the civil war.\n\nI. East Central Europe in World War II (except Poland)\n\n1.. The Baltic States\n\nAs mentioned earlier, part of Lithuania was recognized as being in the Soviet sphere of influence, and part in the German sphere (Secret Protocol to the Nazi-German Non-Aggression Pact, Aug.23, 1939). In late September 1939, however, Stalin ceded some of his Polish territory to Germany in exchange for Soviet influence in all of Lithuania (Soviet-German treaty of Sept. 28, 1939).\n\nStalin first forced the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to sign treaties with the USSR alllowing the stationing of Soviet troops (Sept-Oct. 1939). He then occupied these states in June 1940 -- when France fell -- and organized rigged elections to turn them into Soviet Republics. The Soviet political and economic system was imposed on these countries; also, tens of thousands of people were imprisoned and deported to forced labor camps -- the GULAG-- and \"special settlements\" in Siberia and Soviet Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan)..\n\nIt is not surprising that when German troops entered the Baltic States, they were welcomed with open arms. The Jews, some of whom had supported the Soviet-style governments, were subjected to terrible pogroms. Some citizens volunteered for the German army and the SS. Soviet troops returned in 1944-45, when tens of thousands of people were again deported to Siberia, while those who could, fled to Germany. The Baltics again became Soviet republics, but the memory of independence was strong and they were to regain it in 1991, with the collapse of the USSR.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReading:\n\nFor brief accounts, see: David Sitra, \"Remembering the 1941 Baltic Deportations,\" in: REEIfication, News from Indiana University's Russian and East European Institute, vol. 32, no. 1, Feb. 2008, pp.4, 11; Saulis Suziedelis, \"The Perception of the Holocaust: Public Challenges and Experience in Lithuania,\" in EES [East European Studies, Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars, Washington, D.C.)Jan-Feb. 2008, pp.7-10. For detailed coverage, see Jean Sedlar, Hitler's Empire in East Central Europe.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinland refused Soviet demands for military and naval bases on its territory, deemed necessary by Stalin for the defense of the USSR. Therefore, the Red Army attacked on November 30, 1939, beginning what is generally called \"The Winter War.\" The Finns gave a good account of themselves against Soviet troops, but they could not win without outside help and this was missing. Germany had recognized Finland as being in the Soviet sphere of influence in August 1939, so it did not help. France and Britain planned to send an expeditionary corps but failed to do so because neutral Norway and Sweden refused passage to their troops. In any case, The British and French governments wanted to draw the USSR away from Germany. Ultimately, they sent troops (including Poles) to northern Norway in a bid to prevent German control of ports through which Swedish ore was shipped to Germany. However, Hitler was one jump ahead, attacking Denmark and Norway at the same time, so the expeditionary corps was late and had to be withdrawn, suffering losses. Finland was forced to sign peace with the USSR on March 12 1940, losing some territory, but managed to recover it in summer 1941, when the Germans attacked the USSR. It lost again in 1944-45, coming under Soviet control, but never comparable to the East European states.\n\n[For detailed coverage and bibliography see Sedlar work cited above.

How the Nazis Ruled Europe, New York, 2008].\n\n------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. THE CZECH LANDS.\n\na. BOHEMIA-MORAVIA\n\nSome Czechs joined a Czechoslovak Legion in Poland, which became part of the Polish Army and fought the Germans in September 1939. Many of these soldiers were taken prisoner by the Red Army after it invaded eastern Poland (Sept.17,1939). More Czechs managed to reach France and established an armed force there, later in Britain.\n\nThere was no military resistance movement in the Czech lands until late 1944. A puppet Czech administration collaborated with the Germans - but it was also in touch with the Czechoslovak government-in-exile headed by Edvard Benes in London. German occupation policy was mild in comparison with the ruthless terror in Poland, the western Soviet Union, Greece and Yugoslavia.\n\nThis policy became much harsher when Reinhard Heydrich (1904-1942, succeeded von Neurath as the \"Protector of Bohemia and Moravia\". His assassination in May 1942, was carried out by Czech soldiers parachuted from England. (Their hiding place was betrayed by a fellow soldier, but they fought to the death). In reprisal, the Germans burned down the village of Lidice, allegedly for hiding the parachutists. They executed the men and deported the women and children. They made no secret of this, and world opinion was outraged --as it would also be by the German destruction of the little town of Oradour- sur- Glane in France in July 1944.*\n\n*[Hundreds of villages were burned down and their inhabitants murdered by the Germans in Poland, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, for cooperation with the Partisans and other resistance units, including Home Army units in former eastern Poland. About 300 villages were burned and their inhabitants murdered in Poland alone].\n\nNevertheless, life in the Czech lands was much easier than in occupied Poland or the western USSR. A film about Czech resistance was made in the 1960s, titled \"Closely Watched Train,.\" It won an Adacemy prize in 1966 and is a film classic.*\n\n*[For Czechs under German occupation, see Vojtech Mastny, The Czechs under Nazi Rule. The Failure of National Resistance, 1939-1942, New York and London, 1971; for military resistance in late 1944- early 1945 as the Red Army was entering Czechoslovakia, see Radomir Luza with Christine Vella, The Hitler Kiss. A Memoir of the Czech Resistance, Baton Rouge, LA, 2002 (\"The Hitler Kiss\" was the name Czech resistance fighters gave to death by a German bullet, thus avoiding capture and torture.]-\n\nEdvard Benes, President of the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile (London), decided to cooperate with the Soviets in 1942. He favored a Polish-Czechoslovak Confederation -- but only if Poland agreed to Soviet territorial demands. (He and T.G. Masaryk had supported a revision of Poland's eastern frontier in the interwar period and Czechoslovakia had been an ally of the USSR in 1935-39). Therefore, the Soviet authorities allowed the release of some Czech military who had fought in Czechoslovak Legion as part of the Polish army in September 1939 and were taken prisoner by the Red Army, but they had to sign a declaration that they would not fight against the USSR. Eight hundred of them signed the declaration, travelled in 1940 via Turkey to France to join Allied forces there, then to England. Some, however, remained in the USSR. They later formed the nucleus of the Czechoslovak Armed Force in the Red Army\n\nb. SLOVAKIA\n\nSlovakia was a German satellite state headed by a Catholic priest, Father Josef Tiso (1887-1947). He succeeded Father Andrey Hlinka (who died in 1938) as leader of the largest Slovak party. Tiso cooperated to some extent with the Germans in allowing the deportation of Slovakia's Jews to German death camps in Poland in Feb.- March 1942. In doing so, he at first disregarded the appeals of the Papal Nuncio in Slovakia, to spare the Jews.. The Slovak law of May 1942 exempted certain categories of Jews, especially the converts to Christianity, but only President Tiso could issue exemptions. When the Germans refused to allow Slovak inspection of the deportations, Tiso stopped them. About 35,000 Jews survived until the Slovak uprising against the Germans in August- September 1944, when most of the remaining Jews were deported by the Germans to Auschwitz or to a camp in Slovakia.* An excellent film showing the persecution of Jews in Slovakia was made in the 1960s, titled \"The Shop in the Main Street\" (1965) starring the famous Polish-Jewish actress Ida Kaminska. (It won an Oscar.)\n\nNevertheless, this Slovak satellite state did in some measure fulfill its peoples desire for independence, and its memory fueled the desire for a Slovak state, which was established in 1992.\n\nThere was a small Slovak communist resistance movement, and a combined communist and non-communist uprising broke out against the Germans in central Slovakia on August 30,1944. The fighting went on until October 17, always in hopes of Soviet aid. However,as in the case of the Polish Home Army Warsaw Uprising (August 1-October 2, 1944), the Red Army did not help, and the reason seems to have been the same - Stalins distrust of the insurgents.*\n\n*[On wartime Slovakia, see: Yehuda Jelinek, The Parish Republic (1976), and Livia Rothkirchen, \"Vatican "
