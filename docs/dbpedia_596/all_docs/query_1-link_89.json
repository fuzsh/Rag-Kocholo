He left secondary school, did three years at a commercial school and at seventeen went to work as a clerk at a flour-milling company near Prague.\n\nHe joined the Czech Air Force on 1st October 1934 and after finishing his training in March 1937 he was posted to No. 1 Aviation Regiment.\n\nAfter the German occupation in March 1939 Kuttelwascher decided to escape from Czechoslovakia and on the night of 13th/14th June 1939 he crossed the border to Poland. He took a train from Cracow to Gdynia on 25th July and boarded a Swedish ship for France, arriving at Calais on 1st August.\n\nThe only unit open to foreigners at that time was the Foreign Legion and Kuttelwascher sailed from Marseilles to Oran and went by train to Sidi-bel-Abbes, the Legion HQ. With the declaration of war by France and England he was released in October 1939 and inducted into l'Armee de l'Air.\n\nAfter training at the Fighter Training School at Chartres he joined Groupe de Chasse III/3 at Beauvais/Tille on 18th May 1940.

He began flying Mosquitos on night intruder operations but without success. He was awarded the Czech Military Cross (gazetted 11th August 1942).\n\nHis portrait was made by Eric Kennington (above).\n\nKuttelwascher went to 42 Group, Maintenance Command on 1st October 1942 to act as liaison with the Czech Inspectorate General.
