        "text": "Download report\n\nPreface\n\nSince the Law and Justice (PiS)-led United Right Coalition [Composed of PiS and its two junior partners – Solidarna Polska (United Poland, led by the Justice Minister/Prosecutor General Zbigniew Ziobro) and, until August 2021, Porozumienie Jarosława Gowina (Jarosław Gowin’s Agreement)] took power in 2015, an unprecedented politicisation of the public prosecution has occurred, which has been transformed into a tool for advancing the personal and political interests of PiS and its members. The result has been a growing number of politically motivated investigations carried out primarily against the opposition.\n\nThe continuous changes to the criminal justice system (Criminal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, Law on the Prosecutor’s Service) expand the powers of prosecution (see Annex I), amplifying an “inequality of arms” between the sides of criminal proceedings and jeopardising the legal system’s responsiveness.\n\nBelow, ODF lists some of the most notorious and shocking examples of politically motivated abuses of power by the Public Prosecutor’s Office between 2015 and 2023. More information on many of the involved prosecutors is available on www.panstwo-pis.pl run by the Paragraf-Państwo Association (currently not updated), as well as in numerous statements and reports published by the Lex Super Omnia independent prosecutors’ association.\n\nThis report is divided into two main parts: 1) malicious prosecution and 2) dereliction of duties. The first section covers prosecution cases political in nature, organised into categories of societal groups and professions. The second part covers cases that have either failed to be initiated or were prematurely discontinued by the Prosecutor’s Office due to a politically unfavourable dimension perceived by the ruling coalition or its cronies.\n\nThis report also lists the most prevalent systemic issues eroding the Prosecutor’s Office since the PiS-led United Right coalition came to power and provides a list of recommendations on how to prevent political abuses of public prosecution once the rule of law is restored in Poland. In annex we have included an analysis of the legal changes that expanded the powers of the Prosecutor’s Office.\n\nInformation for this report has been collected from open sources such as articles, interviews, and reports, and directly from maliciously prosecuted victims, their lawyers, and other parties to the proceedings. The detail and length of each case description depend on its severity and the availability of information.\n\nThis edition is an updated and extended version of ODF’s previous reports under the same name from 2021 and 2022 with numerous new cases, updates and analyses added. The new cases include anti-discrimination initiatives and activists like Atlas of Hate and Bart Staszewski, opposition politicians like Donald Tusk, former intelligence chief Grzegorz Małecki, business association president Maciej Witucki, as well as several journalists, a writer and even a rapper.\n\nIn annex, an important legal change has been analysed – a new amendment to the law on the prosecution service, protecting Zbigniew Ziobro’s prosecutors from dismissal and repercussions for their actions until at least 2025, in case the former loses power. Similarly, National Prosecutor Bogdan Święczkowski was granted protection from prosecution when he was appointed to the post of justice of the Constitutional Tribunal in February 2022. His replacement, Ziobro’s personal friend Dariusz Barski, apart from becoming irremovable, was granted additional powers with the new amendment, which were taken away from the Prosecutor General in case the post fell to the opposition following the 2023 elections.\n\nIt is worth noting that the politicisation of public prosecution is not a new phenomenon. During the first PiS government (2005-2007), the public prosecution, headed by Zbigniew Ziobro, became notorious for using political investigations as a tool for propaganda. Examples include the cases of Dr Mirosław Garlicki, Barbara Blida (former Minister of Construction and Spatial Management), and allegedly corrupt judges and doctors. All ended with losses for the prosecution, and often with tragic consequences for the accused (e.g. Barbara Blida’s alleged suicide). Some of the targeted judges won large damages for breach of personal rights by the prosecution.\n\nCurrent division and hierarchy of the Public Prosecutor’s Office\n\nCurrent [Dariusz Barski was appointed to the post of National Prosecutor on March 18, 2022, and was preceded by Bogdan Święczkowski] division and hierarchy [According to nomenclature applied by i.a. EU institutions or CoE, the “Prokuratura Regionalna” is translated as “Provincial Public Prosecutor’s Office”, the “Prokuratura Okręgowa” as “Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office” and the “Prokuratura Rejonowa” as “District Public Prosecutor’s Office”. For ease of reading, “Public” is usually omitted within this report. Furthermore, titles of prosecutors in this report are not capitalised when meaning a prosecutor of a specific level (Warsaw regional prosecutor Konrad Gołębiowski = prosecutor of the Warsaw Regional Prosecutor’s Office) and capitalised when meaning the head of that office (Lublin Provincial Prosecutor Jerzy Ziarkiewicz)] of the public prosecution service in Poland. The diagram includes the names of the prosecutors suspected of political motivations in their actions mentioned in this report (wherever the name of the prosecutor was known). The number next to the name indicates the amount of cases they handle or are involved within this report if there is more than one.\n\nList of abbreviations used\n\nABW: Internal Security Agency (Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego)\n\nAW: Foreign Intelligence Agency (Agencja Wywiadu)\n\nBOR: Government Protection Bureau (Biuro Ochrony Rządu)\n\nCBA: Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (Centralne Biuro Antykorupcyjne)\n\nCJEU: Court of Justice of the European Union\n\nEctHR: European Court of Human Rights\n\nEIO: European Investigation Order\n\nEPPO: European Public Prosecutor’s Office\n\nkk: criminal code (kodeks karny)\n\nKPK: Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks Postępowania Karnego)\n\nKRS: National Council of the Judiciary (Krajowa Rada Sądownictwa)\n\nLSO: Lex Super Omnia (prosecutors’ association)\n\nMEP: Member of the European Parliament\n\nNIK: Supreme Audit Office (Najwyższa Izba Kontroli)\n\nODF: Open Dialogue Foundation (Fundacja Otwarty Dialog)\n\nPFR: Polish Development Fund (Polski Fundusz Rozwoju)\n\nPG: Prosecutor General (Prokurator Generalny)\n\nPK: National Public Prosecutor’s Office (Prokuratura Krajowa)\n\nPiS: Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, political party)\n\nRPO: Polish Commissioner for Human Rights (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich, ombudsman)\n\nSIS: Schengen Information System\n\nSKW: Military Counterintelligence Service (Służba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego)\n\nWSW: Internal Affairs Department (Wydział Spraw Wewnętrznych) of the National Prosecutor’s Office\n\nŻW: Military Gendarmerie (Żandarmeria Wojskowa)\n\n1. Cases of malicious prosecution\n\n1.1 Civil society\n\nBartosz Kramek and the Open Dialogue Foundation\n\nPolitically motivated charges were brought against Bartosz Kramek, the Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Open Dialogue Foundation (ODF), a human rights watchdog known for its harsh criticism of the ruling coalition and condemnation of government policies that undermine Poland’s democratic standards.\n\nFollowing a series of failed attempts to shut down or silence ODF via legal tools [1], [2], [3], Kramek was detained in June 2021 by the Internal Security Agency (ABW) at the request of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin. Kramek was presented with dubious criminal charges of “false declarations” when issuing invoices to his company’s clients between 2012 and 2016 (Art. 271 in relation to Art. 12 and Art. 65 kk), which allegedly constituted a money laundering scheme designed to finance ODF (Art. 299 in relation to Art. 12 and Art. 65 kk). Kramek spent three weeks in pre-trial detention.\n\nThe charges are controversial, considering the absence of injured parties of the alleged crime, the Treasury benefitting from paid taxes, and the investigation directly following Kramek’s publication of an article on Facebook suggesting civil disobedience against the increasingly oppressive PiS-led government. Also, Kramek’s company fully complied with all legal, accounting, and anti-money laundering regulations without any irregularities noted by supervisory bodies until ODF’s conflict with the PiS authorities.\n\nThe investigation was initiated on the alleged basis of “urging to commit a fiscal offence” (Kramek’s proposed civil disobedience actions included the refusal to pay taxes to signal disapproval of the government’s assault on democracy) and then widened to cover potential financial irregularities and money laundering by ODF and Kramek’s company.\n\nAs of August 2021, three prosecutors’ offices have been involved in the case. A memo issued by the ABW in 2019 found it was impossible to prove that any funds resulting from money laundering were received by ODF. It also revealed that the investigation was heavily reliant on assistance provided by Moldova’s former authorities, controlled by the country’s most powerful oligarch and then-de facto leader, Vlad Plahotniuc, whose abuses were targeted by ODF’s advocacy campaigns. The charges against Kramek, much like those against the leaders of the Women’s Strike, also resembled fearmongering against the Polish civil society opposing the government’s policies.\n\nThe same basis for the allegations was used against Kramek’s wife and ODF’s President Lyudmyla Kozlovska in 2018. Her name was reported to the Schengen Information System (SIS), resulting in her ban from entering Poland and other Member States of the European Union based on an opinion of the ABW, declaring her a “threat to state security”. Kozlovska became a target of false accusations along with her brother, Petr Kozlovski. The ban was disregarded by four other EU Member States and Switzerland (with Belgium granting her permanent residence, leading to the SIS ban being lifted), then dismissed three times by the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw, and ultimately by the Supreme Administrative Court (NSA). The courts called the evidence collected by the ABW “insufficient”, “very vague”, and with “unreasonable conclusions” having been drawn, with the NSA concluding that “The accumulated material, secret and public, does not allow the conclusion that Kozlovska poses a threat to state security.”\n\nKramek’s case is handled by Lublin Provincial Prosecutor Jerzy Ziarkiewicz, who is known for handling politically sensitive cases and was promoted to the post by Zbigniew Ziobro, and his aide Prosecutor Marcin Kołodziejczyk from the Lublin Provincial Office (both listed in Lex Super Omnia reports covering dubious prosecutorial promotions and awards in recent years).\n\nOn 26 October 2021, the District Court in Lublin reviewed the defence’s appeals against the preventive measures imposed on Kramek after leaving arrest and deemed them inadmissible. The Court stated that the prosecution unjustifiably imposed restrictions and that the measures were disproportionate and violated the principle of protection of family life.\n\nAs a result, Kramek was free from probation under the police, permitting him to leave the country and return to his wife in Brussels. During the hearing, Prosecutor Kołodziejczyk claimed that the exceptionally intrusive (five times a week) probation was imposed at the personal demand of Prosecutor General Zbigniew Ziobro [1], [2].\n\nAs of late 2023, the prosecution still hasn’t filed an indictment against Kramek, simultaneously blocking the court from removing the last pre-trial restriction in the form of bail, claiming it is still undertaking steps related to the allegedly suspicious shipping of bulletproof vests to Ukrainian armed forces by ODF via the Ukrainian embassy in late February 2022. At the same time, witnesses were questioned, but not in relation to Kramek’s charges, but on the suspicion of organising an unlawful, public fundraiser for Kramek’s bail, with ODF’s Martin Mycielski being the alleged perpetrator. In reality, the bail was submitted by over a dozen individuals, including family, civic activists and journalists.\n\nIn the meantime, Kramek, his wife Lyudmyla Kozlovska and ODF have won six defamation court cases against Law and Justice officials, their cronies and critics, all relating to the allegations of money laundering, ties to Russia, calling for a bloody coup etc. Among those who have to publicly apologise for their accusations, are state broadcaster TVP, deputy secret services chief Maciej Wąsik, MEPs Dominik Tarczyński and Joachim Brudziński, as well as the pro-government Gazeta Polska editor-in-chief Tomasz Sakiewicz (twice).\n\nODF’s Martin Mycielski\n\nMartin (Marcin) Mycielski is one of the leaders of the Open Dialogue Foundation as well as the founder of Spontaneous Civic Campaign Headquarters (Spontaniczny Sztab Obywatelski, SSO), a group responsible for installing over 450 anti-government billboards around Poland. Between April and December 2021, Mycielski also headed SokzBuraka (Beetroot Juice), a Polish social media site renowned for its vehement opposition to PiS.\n\nIn September 2021, Mycielski was called for questioning by the police in Brussels, Belgium (where he resides), following a European Investigation Order (EIO) issued by the Economic Crime Department of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw. The EIO, an international criminal cooperation tool developed by the EU to combat “organised crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, and corruption”, was issued as part of an investigation following a private complaint by PiS Chairman Jarosław Kaczyński. In a two-page statement, Chairman Kaczyński claimed that, with his morality being questioned, “public trust in him was undermined” and “electoral results of him and his party were threatened”, all in a tweet published in January 2021 by SokzBuraka, four months before Mycielski even became its editor-in-chief. The tweet asked why Chairman Kaczyński had been vaccinated for COVID-19 without having to wait his turn, after the press observed Chairman Kaczyński not wearing a mask at the national parliament despite the obligation to wear a mask. The tweets were published from the UK.\n\nThe Warsaw Regional Prosecutor Konrad Gołębiowski initiated an ex officio investigation and decided to use European criminal cooperation mechanisms to question the two potential culprits named by Chairman Kaczyński in his complaint, one of whom was Mycielski. However, Chairman Kaczyński’s complaint was private under Art. 212 kk (defamation), which would, under normal circumstances, be handled without any involvement of the prosecution. According to LSO Prosecutor Ewa Wrzosek, for the prosecution to take up such a case ex officio, there would normally have to be a strong public interest in supporting the victim, e.g., if the victim was disabled or without the means to defend himself.\n\nRight before Mycielski was questioned, all of his Belgian bank accounts were closed and other financial and insurance services terminated, which also led to the termination of banking contracts of the entire Open Dialogue Foundation and its leadership. This procedure, known as de-risking, is implemented by banks when a potentially “risky” client is detected, e.g., following an authority seeking access to their accounts. Prosecutor Gołębiowski claimed in a private correspondence that he had not included orders to access banking records in his EIO.\n\nAs of late 2023 no other actions are known to have been taken by the prosecution in the case.\n\nLeaders of the Polish Women’s Strike\n\nIn February 2021, politically motivated charges were brought against the leaders of the Polish Women’s Strike (Marta Lempart, Klementyna Suchanow, and Agnieszka Czerederecka). The strike was organized in late 2020 and early 2021 in response to the Constitutional Tribunal’s ban on abortion.\n\nThe activists are accused in a July 2021 indictment of causing an epidemiological threat for organising protests during the COVID-19 pandemic (Art. 165 para. 1 kk and Art. 12 para. 1 kk – the introduction of which was widely regarded as violating the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of assembly), insulting a police officer (Art. 226 para. 1), and “praising criminal behavior” (Art. 255 para. 3 kk) in the form of damaging the facades of church buildings and “maliciously obstructing the public performance of a religious ceremony” (Art. 255 para. 3 kk).\n\nKlementyna Suchanow is additionally charged with three offenses: causing a domestic disturbance (Art. 193 kk), destruction of or damage to another’s property (Art. 288 kk), and infringement of an officer’s physical integrity (Art. 222 kk), all in relation to her nailing a poster of the Women’s Strike to the door of the formerly independent Constitutional Tribunal and spilling red paint on a police officer’s uniform.\n\nThe activists’ case is handled by Prosecutor Hanna Stachowicz from the District Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw, who is well-known for dealing with politically relevant cases and consistently ruling in line with the authorities’ preferences. The accusations do not correspond to reality, and a profoundly distorted version of the events was presented to justify the investigation.\n\nOn 6 October 2021, Klementyna Suchanow was indicted for breaking into the grounds of the Constitutional Tribunal on 28 January 2021 and splashing red paint onto the uniform of a police officer. The police officer is represented by attorney Bartosz Lewandowski, a lawyer from the Ordo Iuris Institute, a Poland-based, ultra-conservative think tank that Suchanow exposed for its financial involvement with the Kremlin.\n\nIn addition, Marta Lempart was charged with two counts of defamation for commenting on the humanitarian crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border. The proceedings in this case were conducted by the Military Affairs Division of the District Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw. On July 21, 2022, an indictment concerning the events of October 10, 2021, and December 1, 2021, was submitted to the District Court for Warsaw-Central Warsaw.\n\nThe first of these events was a demonstration in Warsaw’s Castle Square, during which Marta Lempart gave a speech whose “content indicates that in the ranks of the Border Guard there are murderers who throw children into the forest, with which she also insulted Border Guard officers on duty at the border in connection with their statutory duties to protect it”. The activist was accused of committing an act described in Article 212(1) of the Criminal code, i.e. defaming officers in conjunction with Article 226(1) of the Code, concerning insult.\n\nThe second of these charges relates to another demonstration, from December 1, 2021, when Lempart called the Polish Border Guard and Polish Army soldiers “murderers in Polish uniforms” during a demonstration on Wiejska Street (near the Sejm) in Warsaw. Marta Lempart did not admit to committing the alleged acts.\n\nSoon, allegations unrelated to Marta Lempart’s activist activities themselves also appeared. In April 2023. The Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Wroclaw brought charges against Lempart for, among other things, allegedly failing to submit an annual financial report to a court or other authority keeping a register or record of an entity’s business activities. The activist also heard charges saying she was responsible for failing to file for bankruptcy of a commercial company. In a statement sent to Wirtualna Polska, Lempart said she had become “the heroine of another high-profile case by prosecutor Justyna Pilarczyk, who is known for having discontinued the case of Justyna Helcyk, head of the Lower Silesian ONR.”\n\nJustyna Wydrzyńska and the Abortion Dream Team\n\nThe Abortion Dream Team is one of the best-known initiatives campaigning for access to abortion in Poland, right after the Polish Women’s Strike. Under PiS rule, Poland, apart from Malta and the Vatican, introduced the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in Europe.\n\nThe anti-abortion law was already restrictive – since 1993, abortion was legal only in cases of serious threat to the life or health of the pregnant woman, upon confirmation by two physicians; in cases of illegal acts such as rape or incest, upon confirmation by a prosecutor; and cases in which prenatal tests demonstrated that the fetus was seriously and irreversibly impaired, confirmed by two physicians. However, the far-right government tried to ban abortion completely in 2016, which was stopped by mass protests throughout the country. During the COVID pandemic, in October 2020, the improperly elected Constitutional Tribunal (as confirmed by the ECtHR in the Xero Flor judgment) when the improperly elected President of the court Julia Przyłębska banned the possibility of having an abortion due to a defect of the fetus. This premise was responsible for more than 90% of abortions in Poland every year before the ban.\n\nSince the ban’s entry into force in January 2021, the Abortion Dream Team, as of January 2022, spent about PLN 1,5 million on providing treatment for Polish women in their second trimester of pregnancy in medical clinics abroad. Overall, the Abortion Dream Team helped 33,000 women to undergo a safe abortion under medical care, 1,500 of which were pharmacological abortions in foreign clinics.\n\nJustyna Wydrzyńska is a leading activist from the Abortion Dream Team. During the COVID lockdown in 2020, Wydrzyńska provided abortion pills to a woman (known as Anna in the media), who was a victim of domestic violence from her husband. However, the above-mentioned husband caught Anna and confiscated the pills. As a result of not having access to the pills, Anna suffered from a miscarriage. In December 2021, the Warsaw – Praga District Prosecutor’s Office charged Justyna Wydrzyńska with aiding and abetting an abortion and with marketing a medicinal product without marketing authorization. The prosecutor handling her case is Piotr Preneta.\n\nOn 14 March 2023, neo-judge Agnieszka Brygidyr-Dorosz from the Warsaw – Praga District Court found Justyna Wydrzyńska guilty and sentenced her to 30 hours of community service per month for 8 months. During the proceedings, neo-judge Brygidyr-Dorosz approved the presence of Ordo Iuris (a fundamentalist-Catholic lobbying group), whose lawyer tried to demean the defendant by referring to her as a male and by demanding that she be sentenced to 1 year in prison, despite not having the right to request a sentence as a civic observer.\n\nNeo-judge Agnieszka Brygidyr-Dorosz was promoted and delegated to the Court of Appeal in Warsaw on 14 March, 2023, the same day as Wydrzyńska’s verdict, by the Deputy Minister of Justice.\n\nJustyna Wydrzyńska’s case is the most well-known so far, but it does not constitute an exception to the increasing atmosphere of fear around abortion in Poland. On 9 January 2023, the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau raided a private gynecologist’s clinic in Szczecin on orders from the regional prosecutor. The prosecutor claimed having reasons to believe that substances had been provided for conducting medical abortions. Medical records since 1996, in addition to the doctor’s cellphone and two laptops, were confiscated. Doctor Maria Kubisa filed a complaint with the Court in Szczecin and with the Ombudsman.\n\nActivist Andrzej Majdan\n\nThe prosecution has unsuccessfully attempted to charge the activist Andrzej Majdan for assault and for participating in a brawl, even though the accused was actually the victim of the altercation.\n\nOn 24 June 2017, Majdan, a member of the pro-democracy movement Committee for the Defence of Democracy (KOD), was severely beaten by far-right militants from the All-Polish Youth (Młodzież Wszechpolska) during a pro-democracy rally in Radom commemorating the anti-communist protests of 1976. The peaceful gathering was disturbed by a group of nationalist militants who marched in a military-like formation while chanting racist slogans. The rally, as a registered gathering, should have been protected by the police, yet no officers were present.\n\nMajdan was subsequently accused of assault and taking part in a brawl (Art. 158 kk), with the prosecution claiming that Majdan had “inflicted blows with his legs” and “knocked over to the ground, thus putting the participants of this brawl in immediate danger of losing their lives”. All photo and video evidence showed that he was severely beaten by four nationalists and could only attempt to mount a self-defence action while lying on the ground.\n\nDuring one of the hearings, someone cut the fuel lines of Madjan’s car, which was parked outside his defence attorney’s office. That case was dropped in July 2020 by the prosecution due to the failure to identify the perpetrators.\n\nIn February 2021, the District Court in Radom declared Majdan not guilty and categorically the victim of the incident, with the nationalists being the culprits.\n\nProsecutor Justyna Domagała-Szlaga of the District Prosecutor’s Office in Radom, nominated by Prosecutor General Zbigniew Ziobro for the position of deputy District Prosecutor, was in charge of the case as the third person in line.\n\nProsecutor Domagała-Szlaga’s political motivations became evident when, as a member of the Disciplinary Panel at the Prosecutor General’s Office, she punished the retired Prosecutor Beata Mik for publishing columns critical of PiS in Rzeczpospolita. The disciplinary proceedings argued that Prosecutor Mik failed to inform her superiors of her cooperation with the Rzeczpospolita newspaper, even though she had done so for 16 years with permission from the Prosecutor General.\n\nDuring the court proceedings, Prosecutor Domagała-Szlaga requested that the testimonies of all 30 witnesses submitted by the defence be dismissed due to alleged unreliability, while also claiming that the testimonies from the members of nationalist militia were reliable.\n\nIn April 2021, Prosecutor Domagała-Szlaga appealed the verdict, claiming a lack of objectivity and lack of understanding of the case on the side of the Court. In October 2021, the verdict was upheld by the Regional Court in Radom, with the judge finding all of the Prosecutor’s accusations towards the court of first instance “baseless”. In December 2021, Prosecutor Małgorzata Witkowska from the Radom-East District Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the verdict to the Supreme Court. In the appeal, the prosecution claims that Majdan “provoked” the nationalists to beat him. On 26 June 2022, the Criminal Chamber of Supreme Court dismissed the prosecutor’s motion as ”manifestly unfounded”.\n\nActivist Zbigniew Komosa\n\nZbigniew Komosa is an activist known for, among others, laying a wreath every month in memory of the victims of the 2010 Smolensk Air Disaster. Komosa does so during the Smolensk Anniversary, when the accident is commemorated in a semi-official para-religious ceremony led by Jarosław Kaczyński and other PiS representatives at the Smolensk Memorial in Warsaw. The new tradition has become a crucial component of the so-called “Smolensk religion” or “Smolensk Big Lie”, a theory popularised by Chairman Kaczyński himself. According to Kaczyński, Donald Tusk (the leader of the opposition at the time), in agreement with Vladimir Putin, ordered a hit on Kaczyński’s twin brother, Lech (the President of Poland at the time). Lech Kaczyński is commemorated by PiS as a national hero, even though the state commission proved that the crash was a result of bad decisions of pilots who were under pressure to land despite difficult weather conditions. The wreath, with the text “In memory of the 95 victims of Lech Kaczyński, who, ignoring all proce dures, ordered the pilots to land in Smolensk in extremely difficult conditions. Rest in peace. People of Poland. “STOP CREATING FALSE HEROES!” is laid at the memorial by Komosa, and each time, the wreath is demonstratively removed and destroyed by the representatives of the Polish Armed Forces.\n\nFor the first two years, the wreath was removed by soldiers after Komosa left, but since mid-2020, members of the Warsaw Garrison (regular soldiers of Military Police) tear the wreath out of the activist’s hands in front of cameras and often hundreds of witnesses to symbolically destroy it. The soldiers then take its remains to the Garrison. Sometimes, the soldiers even drag activists who are clinging to Komosa’s wreath and haul them across the Piłsudski square.\n\nSince February 2020, the District Prosecutor’s Office for Warsaw Śródmieście North has initiated an investigation against Komosa every time he places a wreath, accusing him of a crime under Art. 261 kk (defamation of a monument) and seeking the penalty of imprisonment. Komosa won the case in the court of first instance in July 2021. The District Court in Warsaw ruled that the activist “realises the rights guaranteed by the Polish Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms to express one’s own views (…) as well as the right to seek the truth”. District Assistant Prosecutor Marek Kozicki, in a multi-page motion, appealed against the verdict, accusing the Court, among others, of “violation of substantive law, namely Art. 261 kk, through its incorrect interpretation leading to an inaccurate conclusion”.\n\nIn December 2021, the court of appeals fully supported the verdict of the first instance, with the judge noting that “it is, on the one hand, the voice of a citizen who presents the truth about the catastrophe, and on the other hand, a form of criticism of the actions of the authorities of the Polish state”. The Courts in both instances consider that Komosa shared no offensive content in the inscription on the wreath and that reliable information in public circulation enables the attribution of moral responsibility for what happened to President Lech Kaczyński. Judge Anna Szymacha-Zwolińska, regarding the prosecution’s appeal, added that “if the law still included the concept of an obviously baseless appeal, this would be it”.\n\nFollowing the final judgement, during the next mensiversary, Komosa was permitted to lay his wreath, yet it was removed again as soon as Komosa left the area. Both the Capital Police Headquarters whose members guarded the monument and the Warsaw Garrison, refused to comment on the incident, despite the Court ruling it was legal for Komosa to lay the wreath, meaning that the soldiers committed theft each time.\n\nIn February 2022, a press investigation revealed that Prosecutors Andrzej Piaseczny and Bogumiła Knap (Prosecutor Knap was highly experienced and about to retire) refused to file the appeal following the July 2021 verdict, explaining that there was no basis. The Prosecutors subsequently faced threats from their superiors, Department Head Prosecutor Piotr Stasiak and Criminal Department Manager Prosecutor Wiesław Kwiatkowski, of being demoted to district level. Prosecutor Knap wrote an official resignation letter to Prosecutor General Ziobro, using her right to an early retirement, and pointed to the threats as the reason.\n\nEventually, Daniel Więckowski, Deputy Head of the Downtown-North District Prosecutor’s Office, filed a cassation to the Supreme Court, describing the wreaths as “defaming the memory” of the late President Lech Kaczynski. Deputy Head Więckowski argued that the wreaths “violate” Article 261 of the Criminal code (defamation of monument) and constitute an element of “political agitation”. On 21 September 2022, the Supreme Court Justice Rafal Malarski dismissed the cassation as “obviously unfounded”.\n\nIn May 2022, the Warsaw Downtown Regional Court dismissed another case filed against Komosa by the Prosecutor’s Office for the same charges. The prosecution also appealed this decision. Judge Magdalena Roszkowska-Matusik from the Warsaw District Court rejected the prosecutor’s motion with clear justification that “the act lacks the characteristic of social harmfulness at all”.\n\nThe 13 activists from the Poland-Belarus border\n\nSince August 2021, as the humanitarian crisis at the border between Poland and Belarus developed and Alexander Lukashenko used migrants to destabilise the EU, the government of Poland ignored its commitments to the Geneva Convention and to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights by denying asylum.\n\nThe Polish authorities’ behaviour goes against, i.e., Art. 6 of EU Directive 2013/32, Art. 33 about non-refoulement of the Geneva Convention and Art. 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights, Art. 4 of Protocol n. 4 of the Geveva Convention, forbidding collective push-backs, a principle also present in Art. 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, as well as in Polish law (Constitution, law on foreigners, Criminal Code – obligation to provide help). The Polish authorities’ violation of the law was even confirmed by the Polish Courts, e.g., Warsaw Provincial Administrative Court and Hajnówka Regional Court.\n\nInitially, the co-founder of the civic movement Obywatele RP Paweł Kasprzak suggested a civil disobedience action on August 24, Chairman of the Board of the ODF Bartosz Kramek vehemently opposed the government’s inhumane actions and advocated for a human rights-based policy, and published an article in Gazeta Wyborcza calling for bringing down the razor wire fence erected at the border.\n\nIn late August 2021, a group of refugees who fled the Taliban in Afghanistan were trapped on the border in Usnarz Górny and denied entry into Poland by the Polish police and border guards. When reports of at least three deaths surfaced, 13 civic activists symbolically damaged the fence to send a message about the illegal mistreatment of asylum seekers. The 13 activists were: Grzegorz Antoszewski, Julia Bednarek, Dominik Berliński, Justyna Butrymowicz, Angelika Domańska, Bernard van der Esch, Julia Gościńska, Leokadia Jung, Anna Kulesza, Bartosz Kramek, Zuzanna Lesiak, Katarzyna Pikulska, and Kajetan Wróblewski.\n\nThe activists chose to record and post the act of civil disobedience on social media themselves.\n\nAll the activists have faced charges for destroying property as per Art. 288 kk, but the Prosecutor’s Office also wanted to arrest the activists as they could “go into hiding”. Such an accusation is particularly absurd, as the activists sought publicity and did not shy away from the legal consequences of their actions.\n\nThe District Court of Sokółka rejected the local District Prosecutor’s Office’s request to put the activists on pretrial detention, arguing that there were no grounds for such a pre-emptive measure. The protest garnered remarkable media coverage and strong condemnation from the national government, which promised that the activists would face dire consequences. The insistence of the Prosecutor’s Office to apply such pre-emptive measures may testify to the political nature of the move.\n\nIn January 2022, Polish MEP and founder of the Polish Humanitarian Action Janina Ochojska decisively criticised the authorities and the border guard, stating that she hoped that the border guard “will at some time be punished for breaking the law and torturing innocent people”. Attempting to silence her criticism, Deputy Justice Minister Maciej Wąsik notified the prosecution of a possible crime, claiming that Ochojska had defamed public officers. Similar actions were taken regarding Władysław Frasyniuk (anti-communist opposition figure), Marta Lempart (Polish Women’s Strike leader), Bartosz Kramek (Chairman of the Supervisory Board at ODF), Michał Kobosko (Chairman of the Poland 2050 party), and Piotr Maślak (journalist at TOK FM).\n\nThe investigation into one of the charges (Art. 276 kk, incitement to the destruction of property) to be filed against Kramek and the publisher of Gazeta Wyborcza was dropped in early January 2022 by the Investigation Department of the Municipal Police in Białystok. The investigation was dropped because no characteristics of a crime were found, which was supported by the prosecution. The decision was publicly criticised by far-right leader Krzysztof Bosak as “anti-Polish” and two days later, on 9 January Prosecutor General Zbigniew Ziobro intervened, ordering an investigation into the discontinuation. This was the second documented and direct intervention of the Prosecutor General into an investigation concerning Bartosz Kramek (the other being in the fiscal case described under “Bartosz Kramek and the Open Dialogue Foundation”). A preliminary investigation into the destruction of the interrogation report of one of the activists, Dominik Berliński, was dropped. The same happened with the preliminary investigation into aiding of the publisher of Gazeta Wyborcza which published Kramek’s article.\n\nThe prosecution filed an indictment in December 2022, valuing the destroyed property (bent razor wire) at PLN 1049, much above its actual value as claimed by the defence. The charge of destruction of property (Art. 288 kk) involved six people, which according to the Criminal Code is punishable by up to five years in prison. The prosecutor charged the remaining seven people with active participation in a gathering (Art. 254 kk), which is punishable by three years in prison. Prosecutor Anna Zejer, spokeswoman for the Łomża Regional Prosecutor’s Office, stated that all the perpetrators acted on frivolous motives and demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law.\n\nIn January 2023, the case was moved from the Sokółka District Court, via the Białystok Regional Court, to the District Court for Warsaw-Śródmieście. There it was assigned (supposedly by the automated lottery system) to neo-judge Katarzyna Olczak, known for closing a case brought by independent prosecutor Ewa Wrzosek against a state TV journalist Samuel Pereira, who compared her to a “mafioso, drug dealer or terrorist” when she fell victim to unlawful Pegasus surveillance (see Surveillance of Prosecutor Ewa Wrzosek case). In March 2023, following a motion by Bartosz Kramek’s attorney Jacek Dubois, the neo-judge was removed from the case by judge Krzysztof Ptasiewicz, who argued that “it is presumed that a court of which such a judge sits does not fulfil the requirement of a court established by law”, i.e. cannot guarantee impartiality, citing the relevant ECtHR verdict (Reczkowicz vs Poland).\n\nThe Wrabec couple\n\nOn 27 October 2021, husband Pawel Wrabec (journalist and one of the founders of the civic movement Obywatele RP) and wife Justyna Wolniewicz-Wrabec (a graphic designer and human rights defender), were detained by police while transporting 2 Iraqi migrants near the border town of Hajnówka.\n\nThe couple decided to take matters into their own hands after seeing the mistreatment of migrants and refugees at the Poland-Belarus border, arguing that they were following Art. 162 kk which penalizes “failing to provide aid to a person or persons being threatened by loss of life or severe injury”.\n\nThe leader of Obywatele RP Paweł Kasprzak argued that “if a human impulse requires a decent person to break the law, then that law must be broken”. The young Iraqi couple had reportedly already spent 40 days wandering the forest at the border and were likely transported back to Belarus by the border guard after the arrest. At that time, at least 9 people had already died at the border due to the actions of Belarusian authorities and their Polish counterparts (as described in the previous case) [This number could be higher due to the media and independent observers being excluded from the border zone]. As of late 2023, 51 migrants are confirmed dead and around 300 are missing.\n\nThe police called the couple’s reasoning “frivolous”. An analysis of the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights confirmed the legality of providing humanitarian (often lifesaving) assistance to migrants crossing the border illegally, while the Supreme Court found the restrictions placed on activists and the media in the border zone illegal.\n\nThe couple spent nearly 24 hours in detention. They were charged with aiding and abetting in the organisation of illegal border crossings by foreigners (Art. 264 kk, punishable by up to eight years’ imprisonment). The case was handled by Prosecutors Jan Andrejczuk and Ewa Dmitriuk of the District Prosecutor’s Office in Hajnówka,\n\nthen transferred to the Warsaw District Prosecutor’s Office with the cooperation of the Lublin bureau of the ABW. As of 2023 the case is handled by the Department for Organised Crime and Corruption in the Lublin Branch of the National Prosecutor’s Office. Second Lieutenant Dariusz Tkaczyk, the same ABW officer who is handling the investigation against Bartosz Kramek, has been assigned to the Wrabec case.\n\nDuring the detention, the smartphones of the Wrabec couple were taken and information from the devices was used by the ABW against other activists. The prosecution delegated substantial resources to their investigation of the case: as of late 2023 over a dozen witnesses were questioned over potential complicity in the crime or ties to the couple, including random contacts acquired from their phones. Investigators also walked door-to-door in Hajnówka inquiring about the couple, showing their photo.\n\nAtlas of Hate\n\nThe Atlas of Hate is an online interactive map of Poland, prepared by LGBT+ activists Jakub Gawron, Pawel Prenta, Paulina Pająk, and Kamil Maczuga, which highlights parts of Poland where local authorities have adopted or are working to adopt so-called “Anti-LGBT Declaration” to make these areas “zones free of LGBT ideology”.\n\nIt led to numerous proceedings stemming from local governments accusing the authors of trespassing and complaints to Voivodeship Administrative Courts by the Polish Ombudsman. The Polish Public Prosecutor’s Office joined conservative local authorities and Christian fundamentalists from Ordo Iuris in court proceedings.\n\nProsecutor Przemysław Ostojski from the Poznań District Prosecutor’s Office (delegated to National’s Prosecutor Office) submitted a cassation complaint of more than five judgments of various Voivodeship Administrative Courts to the National Administrative Court. Despite submitting numerous cassation complaints, the prosecutor’s office has been losing more and more cases.\n\nThe level of legal argumentation from Prosecutor Ostojski in all these cases (the most in Gmina Osiek case) suggests that continuing was a political and ideological decision. Prosecutor Ostojski, in defence of anti-LGBT declarations, invoked “freedom of the speech” from Art. 54 of the Polish Constitution, but the National Administrative Court contended that the article is a personal right in the Constitution, not a right of public institution. Moreover, Prosecutor Ostojski argued that Parliament bills can limit the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, but these acts were passed by local authorities, not Polish Parliament. As of the date of this report’s publication, all charges from Prosecutor Ostojski have been rejected.\n\nActivist Bart Staszewski\n\nBart Staszewski is the most well-known Polish LGBT+ activist who gained popularity by fighting against the “LGBT free zones” introduced by local far-right authorities all over Poland. Staszewski notably took photos of traffic signs placed in towns that have passed such resolutions and declarations, which went viral world-wide. The District Prosecutors’s Office in Tarnobrzeg teamed up with Gmina Tuszów Narodowy in the case against Staszewski for infringement of the Gmina’s personal rights.\n\nBart Staszewski was also targeted by the deputy Minister of Justice Marcin Romanowski, who denounced Staszewski’s comments in social media regarding the Polish Border Guard’s cruelty. Romanowski’s direct supervisor in the prosecutor’s office is the Minister of Justice.\n\nStaszewski had commented on the illegal pushback of parents of a 4-year-old girl by the Border Guards on the Polish-Belarussian border: “The disguisers in WOT uniforms and the liars from the Polish Army will pretend that this did not happen. The pathology that gave such orders should end up in court, and the stooges in uniform who endangered the child – behind the bars”.\n\nEven though the preliminary investigation is being conducted by the Prosecutor’s Office, Staszewski was actually questioned and accused on behalf of the Military Police a year after the events. The proceeding is confidential, and Staszewski has only declared so far that “I was charged with defaming the soldiers and border guards. I admitted to the authorship of the posts, I did not admit to the guilt. I stated that the case was politically motivated and refused to give further testimony”.\n\n1.2 Judges and Prosecutors\n\nJudge Beata Morawiec\n\nJudge Beata Morawiec, former President of the Regional Court in Cracow and President of the Themis Association of Judges, is currently facing prosecution. The Internal Affairs Department (WSW) of the National Prosecutor’s Office (established for the sole purpose of pursuing judges and prosecutors and headed by National Prosecutor Bogdan Święczkowski, see Annex II) has been trying to file charges against Judge Morawiec since she won a personal rights case against Minister Ziobro.\n\nAccording to the judgement, Minister Ziobro committed defamation when notifying Judge Morawiec of her dismissal in 2017 and was obligated to issue a public apology, which he has not done yet, ignoring the verdict.\n\nThe prosecution tried to strip away Judge Morawiec’s immunity based on allegations of corruption (misappropriation of public funds, acting against public interest to gain a financial advantage, abuse of powers, and acceptance of a financial advantage). The removal of Judge Morawiec’s immunity was first approved by the illegal Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court (in an October 2020 decision of a single judge), but then Morawiec’s appeal was revoked by a 3-person jury of the same illegal Disciplinary Chamber in June 2021.\n\nThe allegations were highly dubious. The first alleged that Judge Morawiec defrauded public funds when failing to deliver a legal opinion requested by another court in 2013 (an independent expert confirmed she did in fact deliver it). The second claimed that Morawiec received a bribe in the form of a mobile phone, a claim not supported by any evidence apart from testimonies of Marek B., who was facing many years in prison and whose testimony resulted in a mild approach of the prosecution to his case.\n\nMichal Walendzik, who represented the National Prosecutor’s Office in these proceedings, has been listed by OKO.press and LSO as one of the top prosecutors whose careers were advanced by Mr Ziobro and criticised for his abuse of power when issuing an unlawful decision for the Central Anticorruption Bureau (CBA) to search the house of Judge Morawiec in 2020 despite her being protected by immunity.\n\nOn 28 September 2021, Judge Morawiec was demoted from her post, which was followed by a letter signed by herself along with other judges, in which they refused to adjudicate with judges nominated by the new National Council of the Judiciary. Morawiec justified her decision based on the judgments of the CJEU and the ECtHR of July 2021, in which the legality of the so-called neo-National Council of the Judiciary and its nominations were challenged.\n\nOn August 9 2022, Judge Katarzyna Król from the Katowice-East District Court refused to submit Marek B. to voluntary punishment, claiming the prosecution’s proof in the case was too weak and the defendant’s testimony contradictory, and returned the case to the prosecution.\n\nIn this situation, the only way to continue the case of Marek B. would be to file an indictment by the prosecution’s office. However, since it was not filed, Judge Maciej Czajka — the attorney of Judge Morawiec — suggested that a public court hearing with the participation of Marek B. could reveal the mechanisms behind the framing of Judge Morawiec.\n\nJudge Igor Tuleya\n\nAs with the case of Judge Beata Morawiec, the National Prosecutor’s Office is pursuing yet another judge well-known for his vocal opposition to the reforms eroding the independent judiciary: Judge Igor Tuleya from the District Court of Warsaw and former spokesperson for the Court.\n\nIn November 2020, Judge Tuleya was stripped of his immunity by the unlawful Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court and suspended. The case is currently handled by Prosecutor Czesław Stanisławczyk of the new Internal Affairs Department (WSW) of the National Prosecutor’s Office, who has only been working in prosecution since 2018. The prosecution is charging Judge Tuleya for abuse of power through a criminal breach of secrecy of the investigation (under Art. 231 kk).\n\nThe alleged breach happened when Judge Tuleya allowed the press to hear the justification of the verdict he gave in Court regarding the case on the circumstances under which, on 16 December 2016, the proceedings of the Sejm were moved from the Sala Posiedzeń (Plenary Hall) to the Sala Kolumnowa (Collumn Hall), which is smaller. During the proceedings, the MPs from the opposition were not allowed to vote, which he believed was of vital importance to the public. The judge did not disclose any classified material, and the prosecutor present in court did not object. In this situation, under criminal procedure law, Judge Tuleya was fully entitled to allow the hearing to take place in public. The justification for Judge Tuleya’s ruling, which overturned an earlier discontinuance of the investigation by the public prosecution, revealed, however, embarrassing statements made by leading PiS representatives in connection with pushing through illegal proceedings in the Sejm.\n\nBy discontinuing the proceedings, the prosecution tried to conceal numerous irregularities that occurred during the vote on the 2017 budget. Moreover, the judge notified the Prosecutor’s Office of suspected false testimony on the part of 230 PiS deputies, including Prime Minister Morawiecki.\n\nJudge Tuleya consequently ignored the judgments of the illegal Disciplinary Chamber and did not confess to the Prosecutor’s Office (which was possible only by admitting that he lost his immunity). For this reason, the Prosecutor’s Office submitted a file to the Disciplinary Chamber to detain him. In April 2021, the Disciplinary Chamber rejected this motion due to social protests and pressure from abroad. However, Judge Tuleya was still suspended.\n\nThe newly created Chamber of Professional Liability was designed to replace the abolished Disci plinary Chamber, as the Polish government desperately wanted to unblock the funds from the Next Generation EU funds. This Chamber on not only upheld the decision which did not approve the detention of Judge Tuleya, but also reinstated him to the Warsaw District Court after more than 2 years of being illegally suspended. The attorney of Mr Tuleya, Jacek Dubois, stated: “We knew all along that the entire case is simply an attempt to get back at an independent judge. Our thesis was finally confirmed”.\n\nStanisławczyk is the fifth prosecutor involved in the prosecution of Judge Tuleya. Previously, the Tuleya case in the National Prosecutor’s Office was handled by Dariusz Ziomek from the District Prosecutor’s Office in Gdańsk (delegated to the National Prosecutor’s Office), Piotr Dąbrowski from the District Prosecutor’s Office in Gdynia (also delegated), Franiczek Michera from Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Mińsk Mazowiecki (also delegated), and Piotr Myszkowiec from District Prosecutor’s Office in Poznań (also delegated).\n\nJudge Waldemar Żurek\n\nThe prosecution has played a major role in the ongoing persecution of Judge Waldemar Żurek, a former member and spokesperson of the National Judiciary Council who openly opposed the ruling coalition’s assaults on the rule of law in Poland, including the unconstitutional dissolution of the National Judiciary Council. Since 2016, Judge Żurek has faced an ongoing investigation (beginning with an audit of his asset statements), handled by the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Cracow, represented by Prosecutor Janusz Hnatko, and initiated at the notification by the Deputy Disciplinary Commissioner of the Common Courts and Zbigniew Ziobro’s loyal henchman Michał Lasota. Another investigation was initiated in January 2017 by the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw.\n\nThe seven-year-long investigation included a spectacular and unlawful raid by CBA agents on the judge’s office, the unnecessary declassification of the Judge’s assets declaration by Ziobro, a leak of his divorce case to the pro-government press, and even a questioning of his wife when she was dealing with an endangered pregnancy.\n\nCBA agents were also dispatched by the prosecution to the Bieszczady Mountains to interrogate the lumberjack who purchased a tractor from Judge Żurek, as well as the latter’s neighbours. The fiscal authorities audited the lumberjack’s accounts. The investigation, conducted jointly by the prosecution, the CBA, the police, and the fiscal authorities, failed to find any crimes or irregularities (as was admitted by Prosecutor Hnatko himself).\n\nInstead, the disciplinary commissioner initiated proceedings against Judge Żurek based on a 170-page case file, detailing the lack of payment of PLN 820 (EUR 180) for an allegedly-due civil law transaction tax (PCC), following the sale of a 37 years-old tractor. As it was quickly revealed, following the fiscal authorities failing to claim the tax despite the notification from the Cracow Prosecutor’s Office, the tax was not due at all, as the transaction was exempted.\n\nThis fact led to Commissioner Lasota filing dubious charges of “undermining the dignity of the judge” (Art. 107 para. 1 Law on Common Courts) with the Disciplinary Court in Rzeszów in January 2021, then failing to appear in court in May despite it being his obligation as the acting prosecutor in this case.\n\nOn Tuesday 14 September 2021, Judge Żurek submitted to the President of his Court, Dagmara Pawełczyk-Woicka, a declaration that he did not want to adjudicate with the new, illegally appointed judges in his civil division, following the CJEU’s opinion. The President of the District Court in Cracow replied that “the refusal to take the oath is tantamount to resigning from the judge’s position”, effectively threatening to fire Judge Żurek (which is opposite to the constitutional principle of irremovability of judges).\n\nJudge Żurek also faces removal from a civil case at the request of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Cracow for merely asking the CJEU for an opinion. Judge Żurek was following a case concerning the annulment of a contract, when one of the parties appealed against his decision. The appeal was heard by one judge from the illegally appointed National Council of the Judiciary, which led Żurek to ask the CJEU for an opinion on whether the judge was properly appointed for this position. Against all previously established practices, the Prosecutor’s Office, led by Rafał Babiński, demanded the removal of Judge Żurek from the case with the following justification: “while upholding the rule of law, [the prosecutor’s office] has a duty to react in the event of attempts to disorganize the Polish democratic justice system”.\n\nIn May 2022, while Judge Zurek was in the hospital, the disciplinary ombudsmen of common court judges Piotr Schab and his deputy Michał Lasota, accused the judge at a press conference of falsifying rulings and announced that the case would be referred to the Prosecutor’s Office (which has yet to happen).\n\nIn at least 64 cases, according to their findings, the judge committed falsification of the rulings that he signed, and — in the majority of cases — giving a false date of issuing of these rulings. The proof consisted of the fact that Judge Żurek was working in the Cracow Court on the same days. He replied that he travelled between Warsaw and Cracow during that period.\n\nEven the Extraordinary Control Chamber dismissed the complaint of the Prosecutor General’s deputy Robert Hernand against the final judgment of the Court of Appeals in Wroclaw. The dismissal was done for the protection of personal rights in favour of Judge Waldemar Żurek in February 2023 during a closed session. The dispute resulted from the judge’s insulting slander of his ex-wife because he did not pay the alimony for his children. The ex-wife had published her lying claims in the pro-government newspaper Gazeta Polska, among other publications. The Prosecutor General’s interference was an extraordinary, even if unsuccessful, example of the Prosecutor General’s interference in civil and family matters of an independent judge.\n\nMariusz Krasoń and the Lex Super Omnia prosecutors\n\nProsecutor Mariusz Krasoń (member of the Lex Super Omnia association, LSO), who initiated the 15 May 2019 resolution of Cracow prosecutors criticising the politicization of the prosecution service, has faced prosecution since 2019. As of 2021, he has faced more than a dozen cases, as have his colleagues from the LSO.\n\nA special team of disciplinary commissioners set up under Poland’s new disciplinary regime for judges investigated Krasoń’s comments for Gazeta Wyborcza after the 2017 rally in defence of free courts in Cracow, and his comments for TVN24, in which he warned that prosecutors are not sufficiently protected against COVID-19. In 2019, Prosecutor Krasoń was also questioned in connection to initiating the resolution which admonished the government’s actions “aimed at further political subordination of the judiciary”. He also had to explain why he was wearing a prosecutor’s robe during the January 2020 protest nicknamed the “1,000 Robes March”.\n\nNational Prosecutor Bogdan Święczkowski established all decisions regarding punitive transfers.\n\nOther independent prosecutors face similar arbitrary proceedings, and even criminal prosecution. Most notably, Prosecutor Ewa Wrzosek is being harassed for initiating an investigation into the presidential elections that the government sought to organise during the Covid-19 pandemic despite the blatant breach of the Polish Constitution, originally scheduled for 10 May 2020 (and postponed only 4 days before the scheduled date). First, Prosecutor Wrzosek learned from the media that the disciplinary proceedings were initiated against her. In September 2021, despite the announcement of disciplinary proceedings, criminal proceedings were initiated against Ms Wrzosek instead. She now faces charges of abuse of power (Article 231 kk), punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. The prosecutor managing the case is Edyta Tawrel from the Internal Affairs Department of the National Prosecutor’s Office.\n\nProsecutor Tawrel is also known from the case of Judge Paweł Juszczyszyn. Suspended in 2020 by the illegal Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court for implementing a CJEU judgement to ensure the legality of the new National Judiciary Council, Judge Juszczyszyn was the first independent judge to be returned to work following a court interim measure in 2021. Prosecutor Tawrel, in her request to access the court file, suggested that the National Prosecutor’s Office might instigate criminal proceedings against the judges from Bydgoszcz who ruled in Judge Juszczyszyn’s favour.\n\nProsecutor Wrzosek also faces 3 disciplinary proceedings for her public support of a Supreme Court devoid of political influence and pressure consisting of free courts and an independent prosecutor’s office. In May 2020, the proceedings were sent from the Disciplinary Commissioners of the Judges of the Ordinary Courts to the Disciplinary Court. In November 2021, Judge Wrzosek also informed the public that Apple provided her with evidence that her phone was exposed to the notorious Pegasus spyware.\n\nIn December 2022, the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Szczecin submitted motions to the Supreme Court to waive the immunity of Ewa Wrzosek, who they tried to link to the Mayor of Warsaw, a candidate in the 2020 presidential election. According to the motion, Ms Wrzosek allegedly encouraged her colleague to inform Trzaskowski’s subordinate about the urine test results of the bus driver in Warsaw, who was responsible for an accident.\n\nJudge Wrzosek’s prosecutor points out that her phone was spied on with Pegasus software, which means entries on her phone could have been made by people who hacked into it. Prosecutor Ewa Wrzosek’s office in the Warsaw Mokotow District Prosecutor’s Office building was searched in November 2022 in her absence and without her knowledge. The Provincial Prosecutor’s Office in Szczecin secured two official computers and a pen-drive. Monika Laskowska, who heads the Mokotow District Prosecutor’s Office, did not participate in the search, despite the fact that it is required by law. As Prosecutor Wrzosek herself stated, “This was the first time in history that the office of an active prosecutor, while remaining on duty, was searched”.\n\nKrasoń, Wrzosek, and five other independent prosecutors from LSO (Katarzyna Kwiatkowska, Jarosław Onyszczuk, Katarzyna Szeska, Dariusz Drapała, Artur Małkowski [Małkowski joined LSO after being subjected to the punitive transfer]) were also subjected to punitive transfers. In January 2021, they were transferred from their previous posts and places of residence, having to move up to 411 km with less than 2 days of notice in the midst of the COVID pandemic.\n\nSuch modus operandi constitutes an abuse of Article 106 of the Public Prosecutor’s Office Act, which provides for two possibilities to move prosecutors to other offices without their agreement: either for up to 6 months a year to a different city (para. 2) or for up to 12 months within the same city, for substantiated reasons and due to staffing needs (para. 3). As the action is completely discretionary and non-appealable, two of the prosecutors (LSO President Katarzyna Kwiatkowska and board member Jarosław Onyszczuk) already contested them before the Labour Court, with others aiming to do the same.\n\nThe Commissioner for Human Rights (RPO), Adam Bodnar, intervened within 2 days of the decision, requesting an explanation of the perceived discriminatory actions. In response, National Prosecutor Święczkowski argued that the delegations were due to staffing needs (despite none of the distant offices reporting any) and did not explain as to why LSO prosecutors were targeted specifically.\n\nThe Regional Court in Cracow ruled in June 2021 that the delegations ordered by the National Prosecutor Bogdan Święczkowski were unlawful and unsubstantiated. With this judgement, Krasoń, together with 6 other prosecutors persecuted in the same way, can claim protection of their labour rights and try to hold the National Prosecutor to account.\n\nThe Deputy Disciplinary Ombudsman of the National Prosecutor’s Office is investigating whether Krasoń committed disciplinary misconduct. The issue stems from Krasoń’s prosecutor’s desire to participate in professional training. The prosecutor applied for the training, but such a request must be supported by the principal’s approval. The principal consented, but only verbally, as he happened not to be present at the headquarters of prosecutor’s office.\n\nOn the basis of the verbal consent, Krasoń submitted the request, and the principal, at the first possible moment, confirmed his consent in writing. This, however, was enough for the regional prosecutor to request the deputy disciplinary ombudsman to initiate proceedings and punish Krasoń.\n\nRecent media reports indicate that the case is at the investigation stage, after which disciplinary proceedings may be initiated. A dangerous precedent has been set in the case of Justyna Brzozowska, a prosecutor from Lex Super Omnia.\n\nProsecutor Kamil Kowalczyk, who brought the indictment against Brzozowska, who was delegated to the National Prosecutor’s Office and previously worked at the Malbork Provincional Prosecutor’s Office, demanded the exclusion of judges Grzegorz Fidrysiak, Piotr Kluz and Monika Popielarska.\n\nThe reason was that they had signed an appeal for the full implementation of the EU Court of Justice’s rulings on the disciplinary system for judges, including the liquidation of the then-existing Supreme Court Disciplinary Chamber from July 2021. More than 4,000 judges and prosecutors signed on to that appeal. Prosecutor Kowalczyk called it a “political declaration”. Prosecutor Brzozowska called the action “procedural obstruction.”\n\nThe reason for the reprisals against Prosecutor Brzozowska may be the fact that she refused to open an investigation into the alleged diplomatic treason of former Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\nCracow judges who ruled in the Krasoń case\n\nIn late 2020, investigations were launched into seven judges from Cracow. Three of the investigations came from the Court of Appeals and four from the Regional Court, after the judges ruled favourably in the Krasoń case in labour code-based disputes, referring to Art. 106 of the Public Prosecutor’s Office Act. The judges were summoned by the National Public Prosecutor’s Office to be interrogated by its Internal Affairs Department (WSW), after demanding that Judge Krasoń receive compensation from the State and be reinstated in his position.\n\nIn January 2021, it was revealed that the WSW, headed by Piotr Myszkowiec, had initiated criminal proceedings concerning 13 judges who had dealt with Krasoń’s case: Judge Marzena Henrych, Judge Sabina Czech-Śmiałkowska, Judge Katarzyna Rozwoda, assessor Sławomir Folusz from the District Court for Cracow-Śródmieście in Cracow; Judge Agata Pyjas-Luty, Judge Monika Kowalska and Judge Iwona Łuka-Kliszcz (retired) from the Court of Appeal in Cracow; Judge Jarosław Łukasik, Judge Grażyna Baran, Judge Urszula Pałkowska-Różycka and Judge Dominika Augustyn of the District Court in Cracow, and Judge Aneta Tomasik-Żukowska of the Cracow-Nowa Huta District Court (delegated to the District Court in Cracow).\n\nAll of them were summoned for questioning by the prosecution regarding an alleged abuse of power (Art. 231 kk), a move widely viewed as an attempt by the prosecution to intimidate independent judges, as it had done two years earlier against dozens of Cracow judges who passed a resolution in protest against the degrading and inhuman treatment of a former court of appeal president who was imprisoned. The Polish Ombudsman for Human Rights also intervened in the matter, expressing deep concern that these actions may interfere with the independence of judges.\n\nThe investigation was finally discontinued on 3 November 2021.\n\nJudge Wojciech Łączewski\n\nWojciech Łączewski is a former Judge of the District Court for Warsaw-Śródmieście. Łączewski gained the attention of the authorities by delivering rulings inconvenient to the government. Most notably, in March 2015, in a non-final judgement, Judge Łączewski sentenced the former heads of the CBA and members of the top echelons of the ruling party, Mariusz Kamiński (and Maciej Wąsik (currently the Ministry of the Interior and Admnistration & Special Services Coordinator and one of his deputies, respectively), to three years in prison and a 10-year ban on holding public administration positions for abuse of power [He has also ordered to re-open a discontinued investigation into the responsibility of some state officials for the organisation of the twin brother of the PIS leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, late president Lech Kaczyński’s visit to Katyń that resulted in the Smoleńsk air crash]. After the PiS-controlled ruling coalition came to power, Judge Łączewski was presented with a series of criminal charges.\n\nIn early 2016, pro-government media disclosed screenshots of an alleged correspondence on Twitter between Łączewski and a person impersonating Tomasz Lis, the editor-in-chief of the Polish Newsweek. The correspondence allegedly shows Łączewski persuading the influential journalist to develop a new strategy towards the PiS government that could hurt its standing. Łączewski denied his involvement, and in February 2016, notified the Prosecutor’s Office that someone may have hacked his Twitter accounts and, without his knowledge, corresponded on his behalf.\n\nThe case was picked up by Prosecutor Marek Pubrat, of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Cracow. Two proceedings were conducted in parallel. The first concerned the impersonation of a judge and was discounted, with the final decision made by Deputy Prosecutor General Krzysztof Sierak. Sierak is associated with the government-friendly, ultra-Catholic association of prosecutors Ad Vocem and a trusted ally of National Prosecutor Bogdan Święczkowski. Importantly, Sierak had overseen the investigation during its earlier stages, thus seriously breaching procedural rules, and putting in question the legitimacy of the impartiality of the Prosecutor’s Office.\n\nThe second investigation was initiated against Łączewski himself. Cracow Prosecutor Marek Pubrat found that, if there was no hacking attack against the former judge’s Twitter accounts, Łączewski was guilty of submitting a fake notice of crime and providing false testimony, actions punishable by up to three years in prison. To present Łączewski with the charges, the Prosecutor’s Office made an unsuccessful attempt to waive his immunity. With Łączewski’s resignation from his position in November 2019, he was no longer protected by judicial immunity and the Cracow prosecutor’s office was able to refer the case to court without any obstacles. In October 2020, the indictment against the former judge was submitted to the Warsaw-Mokotów District Court. The case is pending, with no court hearing scheduled so far.\n\nIn a separate case, former Judge Łączewski faces charges of an alleged disclosure of classified information (an offence under Art. 265 para. 1 kk) regarding two police officers in the justification attached to one of his judgements. In April 2016, Head of the Central Anticorruption Bureau Ernest Bejda reported to the Prosecutor’s Office that the justification of the sentence against former Heads of the CBA Mariusz Kamiński and Maciej Wąsik disclosed top-secret information about the identity of undercover police officers. As a part of the investigation, the Internal Security Agency (ABW) secured the hard drives of Łączewski’s computers, which contained, inter alia, Łączewski’s notes from the Kamiński and Wąsik case and from many other cases conducted by the judge, constituting a serious breach of professional secrecy and secrecy of the deliberation of judges.\n\nŁączewski assures that he did not disclose any confidential data, explaining that “the judgment contains charges prescribed from the public indictment. Similarly, no personal data was disclosed in the justification, which mentions only the names of the CBA officers that were given by Maciej Wąsik himself at an open court hearing.” The investigation is led by Prosecutor Jacek Mikłuszka of the District Prosecutor’s Office in Opole.\n\nFormer Judge Łączewski sentenced Mariusz Kamiński and Maciej Wąsik, former heads of CBA, to three years of imprisonment for abuse of power. At the time, Kamiński was especially close to the PiS leader Jarosław Kaczyński. However, in November 2015, President Andrzej Duda granted pardon to Kamiński and three other individuals. The decision caused controversy over the legal permissibility of such action.\n\nAlthough no one has denied the President’s right to grant pardons to convicted criminals, this was the first case in the post-war history of Poland of a pardon being granted, even though the judgement of the court of the first instance was not final and valid (which meant that the criminal responsibility of the given persons was not definitively settled) [One should point out now that a very general regulation, Article 139 of Constitution, does not settle when granting a pardon can be introduced; however, the only imple menting rules of statutory rank are included in the KPK, in Chapter XII, entitled “Procedure after the verdict is valid and final”]. Moreover, the pardon decision was issued without following the Code of Criminal Procedure and without the President becoming acquainted with the case files, and was therefore completely arbitrary. The President furthermore stated “(…) I decided, in a way, to free the justice system from this case, where some one would always say that the courts acted on political orders, and to cut through this problem.”\n\nIt is nonetheless much easier to suspect political motivation in the actions of the President, who is an appointee of the ruling party, then of the courts equipped with the attribute of independence. Notably, directly after being pardoned, Kamiński was appointed to the post of Minister-Coordinator of the Secret Services.\n\nŁączewski also points out that the authorities’ attacks against him have intensified after his filing of a civil lawsuit against Minister of Justice/Prosecutor General Zbigniew Ziobro in the autumn of 2019 for infringement of personal rights. The case is still pending.\n\nIustitia president Judge Krystian Markiewicz\n\nThe Internal Affairs Department (WSW) of the National Prosecutor’s Office has reportedly initiated proceedings against Prof. Krystian Markiewicz, a judge of the Regional Court in Katowice and President of the Iustitia Judges’ Association. Judge Markiewicz, as well as the member of the Themis Association, Judge Maciej Czajka from the Regional Court in Cracow, are facing criminal charges for commenting in an OKO.press article about how Poland should implement CJEU orders regarding the illegal Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court (interim measure of 14 July 2021 and judgement of 15 July 2021).\n\nThe investigation is led by Prosecutor Łukasz Radke, appointed to the WSW from the District Prosecutor’s Office in Koło, outside of the standard competition procedure. As with all prosecutors delegated to the WSW, he can be recalled by his superiors for simply issuing a decision that they perceive to be contrary to their interests.\n\nIt is unknown whether the National Prosecutor’s Office’s proceedings are at the stage of preliminary examination or proper investigation, or what charges could be filed and if the investigation is carried out ex officio or following a notification. The possible charges that could be brought against the judges are Art. 190 para. 1 kk (threatening another person), which would stem from a notification by one of the persons mentioned in the article (e.g., so-called judges of the Disciplinary Chamber and other unlawfully appointed Supreme Court justices); Art. 191 para. 1 kk (violence or unlawful threat); or Art. 225 kk (influencing official acts), the latter two prosecuted ex officio. As of 2023, the proceedings are still ongoing. As Prof. Krystian Markiewicz himself commented on the case, “it means that in reality these proceedings are being conducted only to have a chilling effect among judges and keep them in a state of uncertainty, not to lead to their punishment.”\n\nProsecutor Radke has requested information from OKO.press on the judge’s involvement in the development of the article. OKO.press refused the request, as the information is protected under journalistic confidentiality and revealing it would breach Art. 12 para. 2 point 2 of the press law.\n\nJudge Markiewicz is the target of the Prosecutor’s Office even in ordinary civil cases he adjudicates, such as the credit card debt case of a resident of the city of Dabrowa Gornicza. After Judge Markiewicz asked a controversial question to the authorities about the status of a fellow judge to the Court of Justice of the EU, Prosecutor Adam Terlikowski of the District Prosecutor’s Office in Katowice unexpectedly joined the civil case. He justified his action on the grounds that the prosecutor’s office gets involved “in every case of disorganization of the Polish democratic justice system”, as well as, allegedly, the asking of preliminary questions to the CJEU in the cases of neo-judges.\n\n1.3 Opposition politicians, lawyers, and local government leaders\n\nFormer transport minister Sławomir Nowak\n\nAn investigation conducted since July 2020 concerns former Civic Platform Minister of Transport Sławomir Nowak, who is suspected of 17 crimes (including creating an organised crime group, bribery, and money laundering) [1], [2] and is used as a symbol of the general corruption of the political opposition. The case is linked to the investigation conducted by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine while Nowak was Head of Ukraine’s Ukravtodor (Ukraine’s State Road Service) and a close aide to the current opposition leader and former Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\nThe government conducted a large-scale smear campaign against Nowak, and Prosecutor Mariusz Dubowski of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw set a bail of PLN 1 million (circa EUR 220,000). When Nowak’s daughter paid the bail, Dubowski refused to accept it since the prosecution only received (with the changes to Art. 266, 281 and 156 of the KPK) the money after the bail was posted, utilising a controversial provision.\n\nSimultaneously, Minister Ziobro threatened that he would disclose evidence, blackmailing the court and providing a one-sided point of view to discredit Nowak before the final sentence, demonstrating the growing disproportion between the prosecution’s powers and the rights of suspects.\n\nIn August 2018, the Court of Appeal in Warsaw supported the complaint from Nowak’s defence, repealing the pre-trial detention and ordering the return of the PLN 1 million bail. The decision is final.\n\nStill, there is no judgment against Mr Nowak. Nowak’s attorney requested to change the judge conducting the case, as Judge Iwona Szymańska is the wife of former PiS Minister for European Affairs Konrad Szymański.\n\nOpposition attorney Roman Giertych\n\nThe Prosecutor’s Office launched an investigation into opposition attorney Roman Giertych and former Vice Prime Minister in the first PiS government, which has continued since 2017 and is based on questionable charges of financial crimes (aiding in two cases of alleged fraud) regarding Polnord, a company represented by Giertych’s law firm and previously controlled by Leszek Czarnecki. The case was accompanied by numerous abuses of power by the prosecution (incl. an illegal arrest, unlawful use of the CBA and charging Giertych while he was in hospital in a life-threatening condition), as ruled by the Poznań Courts five times already, most recently the District Court Poznań – Stare Miasto in January 2021. The same court verdict did not confirm the likelihood of fraud in the two cases and refused detention for Giertych.\n\nThe case is also being used to paint a negative picture of the opposition (Giertych is, among others, an attorney to the leader of the main opposition party, former Prime Minister Donald Tusk). Giertych is being directly targeted by National Prosecutor Bogdan Święczkowski, who has moved his case between various prosecutor’s offices in Warsaw, Wrocław, Poznań, and Lublin, where the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office is headed by Święczkowski’s close associate, Jerzy Ziarkiewicz. The prosecutor is actively seeking courts that might believe the weak evidence provided for irregularities in two transactions between private companies involving his law firm. At the prosecutor’s request, the CBA was involved to investigate the matter, despite the charges not being part of its responsibilities (no corruption nor state economic interests infringed).\n\nFollowing numerous irregularities and judgments in support of Giertych’s complaints, Judge Sławomir Szymański from Poznań-Old Town Regional Court sent a letter to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stating that the detention of Roman Giertych was unlawful, and that the services subordinate to the Prime Minister acted illegally. The Ombudsman took a similar position. No reaction came from the Prime Minister.\n\nIn November 2021, the Prosecutor’s Office lost another complaint to Giertych and was forced to give back the car of one of the suspects, which had been previously seized, to its owner. According to the competent Poznań District Court, the prosecutor’s office was unable to find any significant evidence against the suspect. Lublin Provincial Prosecutor Ziarkiewicz sought to have the complaint moved to Lublin (where the court is managed by Ziobro’s appointee, who was previously employed at the Ministry of Justice and is seen as loyal to the justice minister), although the decision about the seizure was still made by the prosecutor’s office in Poznań.\n\nThe Lublin-West District Court did not grant the request of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin for the application of temporary arrest against attorney Roman Giertych in March 2022.\n\nIn April, the decision was upheld by the District Court in Lublin. The Prosecutor’s Office officially accused Judge Dorota Dobrzanska of bias due to her membership in the Association of Polish Judges Iustitia, which, like Giertych, opposed Ziobro’s changes to the judiciary system.\n\nRoman Giertych filed a complaint against the actions of the prosecution in 2020, which was not taken into account by the Prosecutor’s Office. It concerned, among other things, the attempt to read charges to the former Deputy Prime Minister even though he was lying unconscious on a hospital bed. Prosecutors who abused power were: Marcin Jędruszczak, Anna Kijak-Głęboczyk and Jacek Motawski from the prosecution in Poznań, Jerzy Ziarkiewicz from Lublin Prosecutor’s Office and Marek Gołębiewski from the National Prosecutor’s Office. “The prosecutors were aware that the actions they were taking were unlawful, and their intention was to gain access to information covered by secrecy” – assessed Judge Marcin Krakowiak.\n\nNiepołomice Mayor Roman Ptak\n\nMayor Roman Ptak of Niepołomice and his deputy Adam Twardowski have been targets of the prosecution since 2019. PiS wanted to install a figure linked to the party as the head of the wealthy town led by Ptak at the time, which would thus entail the administration of a considerable amount of EU funds that flows into the municipality every year.\n\nIn late 2019, Ptak and Twardowski were detained by CBA with vague allegations of dereliction of duties (Art. 231 para 2 kk) and making a false statement about the law on public procurement (Art. 233 para 1 & 6 kk). Ptak and Twardowski denied the allegations, and the prosecution has not presented any proof. Ptak was replaced by the PiS-linked Krystian Zieliński, with no form of electoral mandate. After 10 months, in September 2020, the District Court of Katowice-East reinstated both, lifting the preventive measures of a ban on holding official posts and cash bail, finding the reasoning for them “redundant.”\n\nNevertheless, in January 2021 the National Prosecutor’s Office stated an indictment was filed with the District Court in Wieliczka by a prosecutor of the Silesian Regional Department of the Department for Organised Crime and Corruption of the Nation.al Prosecutor’s Office in Katowice. Ptak and Twardowski face up to 10 years of imprisonment.\n\nSpeaker of the Senate Tomasz Grodzki\n\nDuring its first term (2015-2019), PiS took control of both chambers of the Parliament. In the elections of 2019, PiS lost its majority in the Senate, and on the exact day Prof. Tomasz Grodzki was elected Speaker of the Senate, Polish public media started to make claims about Grodzki potentially soliciting bribes when he was a doctor, without any evidence.\n\nOn 22 March 2021, the Senate received a motion from the Regional Prosecutor in Szczecin demanding to waive immunity for Speaker Grodzki so that he could be prosecuted. According to the investigators, between 2006 and 2012, Grodzki, the Head and Director of the Clinical Department of Thoracic Surgery at the hospital in Szczecin-Zdunowo at the time, took money from patients he was supposed to operate on.\n\nImportantly, the alleged corruption scandal was first brought to light by the pro-government media in autumn of 2019, shortly after the parliamentary elections. Simultaneously, Grodzki became the face of the only institution capable of halting the law and the appropriation of the state by PiS with the Senate’s vetoes. Previously, in over 30 years of medical practice, Grodzki had never been accused of abuse. On the contrary, Grodzki—the President of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Polish Society of Cardio-Thoracic Surgeons, a national consultant in the field of thoracic surgery, a court expert, a local councillor of the city of Szczecin, and finally a Senator (2015-2019)—had an impeccable reputation.\n\nThe investigation officially began on 4 December 2019, according to a report submitted by a PiS councillor of the regional council of Pomeranian Voivodeship, Karol Guzikiewicz. Per Guzikiewicz, witnesses of the corruption, which allegedly took place several years before, reported the crimes to him. The Prosecutor’s Office did not explain, however, why the victims did not submit their reports earlier. Additionally, Guzikiewicz himself later apologized to Grodzki on Twitter “for [his] false claims that the Speaker of the Senate Tomasz Grodzki took bribes.” He also later claimed that it was just “satire.”\n\nGrodzki became a target of vicious smear campaigns by the pro-government state media which bombarded viewers with sensational materials about his alleged corruption, based mainly on anonymous statements. An especially heated smear campaign ensued in autumn of 2020 after Professor Agnieszka Popiela, a researcher at the University of Szczecin and a supporter of PiS, posted on social media that she had to pay approximately EUR 450 for a surgery on her dying mother. Soon afterwards, she reversed her story. She also had to apologise to Grodzki for defamation, as ruled by a court in a civil lawsuit case initiated against Popiela by Grodzki.\n\nThe authorities’ determination to prosecute one of the opposition leaders is perhaps best demonstrated by the CBA issuing an unprecedented announcement in January 2021 that anyone who bribed Grodzki would avoid punishment if they reported the crime. CBA’s “appeal” was widely interpreted as a politically motivated attempt to find evidence against Grodzki. Furthermore, CBA agents called patients of Grodzki for interrogations. Despite the pandemic, they had to appear in person to answer CBA’s questions or be punished by a fine or even arrest. In total, out of 180 people interrogated, two individuals (including only one patient) testified that they had personally handled bribes to Grodzki.\n\nAccording to the media reports, even though the Prosecutor’s Office handling the case was not satisfied with the materials it had gathered, on 22 March 2021, the National Prosecutor’s Office pressured it to file a motion to strip Grodzki of immunity. It has been speculated that the authorities were hoping to divert the public’s attention from revelations of cronyism and graft by Daniel Obajtek, the PiS-appointed Head of Orlen. Orlen is the largest state-owned company, and Obajtek had appeared in speculations about who the next Prime Minister might be. The Prosecutor’s Office’s motion was signed by Prosecutor Artur Maludy, Head of the Szczecin Regional Prosecutor’s Office (appointed by the Minister of Justice and Prosecutor General Z. Ziobro).\n\nDuring a press conference on 23 March 2021, Grodzki stated, “The Senate is a redoubt of democracy, a bastion of free thought and a hope for the return of the rule of law in Poland. Therefore, if the ruling party, which has been hunting me for a year and a half, wants to regain the majority in the Senate this way, I say: No.” Earlier, when the case began, he emphasised that he had never accepted benefits from patients or demanded money from them for treatment. He also presented the account of his former patient, Tadeusz Staszczyk, according to which in December 2019, Staszczyk was offered PLN 5,000 (roughly EUR 1,100) in exchange for stating that Grodzki had demanded money from him and that he was only admitted to the hospital after handing it to the doctor. Although Staszczyk notified the prosecutor’s office about this attempt of extortion of testimony, the perpetrator was not identified. Meanwhile, the PiS-controlled state broadcaster started attacking Staszczyk for his alleged cooperation with the communist security services before 1989. In addition, a few dozen patients treated in the period indicated by the prosecutor’s office confirmed in writing that Prof. Grodzki never asked for or accepted any money for their treatment.\n\nAs in many other cases, Grodzki’s case shows the dangerous collusion between the Prosecutor’s Office, special services, and pro-government media to eliminate an opponent of the authorities — in this case, the country’s third most senior official after the President and Speaker of the Lower House (the Sejm). Following 15 months of investigation and even the involvement of the state apparatus, there is no hard evidence to suggest that Grodzki is complicit in any crimes.\n\nDue to formal shortcomings, the Senate called on the Prosecutor’s Office to retract its motion, which the Prosecutor’s Office did not do, resending it practically unchanged. Therefore, in October 2021, in accordance with the provisions described in the Act on the exercise of the mandate of deputy and senator, the Senate refused to consider the motion to waive Grodzki’s immunity, ending the course of the case.\n\nAt the end of March 2022, the National Prosecutor’s Office announced that the Regional Prosecutor’s Office in Szczecin had sent a request to the Senate for consent to prosecute Senate Speaker Tomasz Grodzki. On 18 May 2022, the Senate majority decided not to lift the politician’s immunity so investigators cannot charge him.\n\nThe smear campaign against Prof. Grodzki continues in the pro-government media.\n\nWilanów district officials and Profeto church foundation\n\nThe District Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw has become involved in a dispute between the authorities of Warsaw’s Wilanów district and a government-funded Catholic Church foundation, Profeto. The prosecution is investigating whether officials committed a crime of abuse of power by refusing to grant permits to Profeto to raise a large building, which would go against the parcel’s zoning plan.\n\nThe investigation was launched under Art. 231 KK, which deals with a public official exceeding powers or failing to fulfill duties in such a way that acts to the detriment of public or private interests.\n\nThe issuer of the decision was an official of the Wilanów district who acted under the mandate of Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, one of the leaders of the opposition party Civic Platform. The officials therefore felt that the initiation of the investigation was supposed to cause a chilling effect on them and Mayor Trzaskowski.\n\nProfeto was founded by the Priests of the Sacred Heart and is headed by the controversial priest Michał Olszewski, a personal acquaintance of Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro. So is Michał Olszewski’s brother, Grzegorz Olszewski, who thanks to Ziobro’s political influence, has headed the Alior Bank board since 2021. Priest Olszewski has gained common notoriety as an exorcist who recommends scaring demons with salceson (a type of meat in Polish cuisine).\n\nFormer PM Donald Tusk and businessman Marek Falenta\n\nBusinessman and convicted criminal Marek Falenta was No 67 on the list of 100 richest Poles in 2013. In 2014, Falenta bought a 40% stake in a company called Składy Węgla (“Coal Storage”), which imported and sold coal from Russia and Kazakhstan. The well-thriving business collapsed when the prosecutor’s office, still under the Civic Platform government, entered the company, bringing charges including money laundering, VAT extortion, and fraud. Falenta had already been sentenced for fraud in 2009.\n\nImmediately after Składy Węgla’s legal troubles began in 2014, right-wing media (“Wprost”, “Do Rzeczy”) began publishing records of wiretaps of Civic Platform politicians, which waiters paid by Falenta had set up in restaurants in Warsaw. Falenta was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for wiretapping politicians in 2014. He admitted his crime in a letter to Law and Justice leaders, claiming it was done with the knowledge and acceptance of Law and Justice on the condition he would be protected and given a reward for “helping to take Poland back from the hands of criminals”.\n\nAfter his release in the autumn of 2022, Falenta denounced Prime Minister Donald Tusk for his actions from 2014, claiming that broke the law by blocking – as Prime Minister at the time – imports of coal from Russia, which happened to be the foundation of Falenta’s company Składy Węgla. Falenta accuses Tusk of exceeding his powers. The Warsaw District Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation against Tusk, upon Falenta’s notification in April 2023.\n\nDonald Tusk summarised the situation: “PiS is prosecuting me for my government’s fight against Russian coal imports. The prosecutor’s office is acting at the request of Marek Falenta, the importer of this coal, who was convicted of illegal wiretapping. He used his tapes, in agreement with PiS, to bring down the government. A script written in Cyrillic”.\n\n1.4 Former allies\n\nFormer PiS politician Przemysław Marchlewicz\n\nThe Prosecutor’s Office launched a failed investigation into the former prominent local PiS politician and Vice President of the Lotos oil company, Przemysław Marchlewicz. Marchlewicz was a city councillor and regional board member of PiS in Gdańsk, but he was twice detained on the orders of the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office in Gdańsk (in July 2018) and in Lublin (in May 2020) on the allegation of fiscal crimes (VAT fraud). The court of appeal in Gdańsk ordered pre-trial detention with a PLN 200,000 bail and, if delivered, a ban on leaving the country and police custody. The case was handled by Prosecutor Jerzy Ziarkiewicz, serving as Head of the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin.\n\nMarchlewicz claimed the prosecution’s actions were political, stemming from him becoming too independent from PiS. This seemed to culminate in a leaked recording of a private conversation from 2016 in which he called out the Head of the secret services as “an alcoholic and a closeted homosexual”, which according to him could be used to blackmail them and thus compromise the institution.\n\nIn November 2020, the Court of Appeal in Gdańsk revoked the prosecution’s motion for detention, ruling it was unnecessary even though it was previously approved by another judge of the same court. Since his first detention in July 2018, no indictment against Marchlewicz has been filed by the prosecution.\n\nSupreme Audit Office President Marian Banaś\n\nThere is an ongoing battle between the ruling camp and the current President of NIK, and former PiS Minister of Finance Marian Banaś.\n\nBanaś fell out with the government after he was revealed in 2019 to have allegedly committed fraud. Since then, Banaś’s institution has issued a series of reports revealing serious irregularities in the government’s actions (following formal audits initiated by the NIK). In response, the National Prosecutor’s Office has targeted Banaś, officials loyal to him, and even his family.\n\nCurrently, Banaś faces over a dozen charges, including filing false asset and fiscal declarations (Art. 271 kk – false declaration). His son, Jakub Banaś, and daughter-in-law also face seven charges each, including using false VAT invoices to extort PLN 120,000 (EUR 26,000) in state funds and PLN 80,000 (EUR 17,500) in VAT tax. The prosecution’s actions against Banaś are showcased by state media on a daily basis.\n\nThe detention of Banaś’s son and daughter-in-law was conducted in a spectacular fashion (similar to that of Bartosz Kramek) by a team of 13 armed CBA officers who treated them as dangerous criminals. The team acted on the request of the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office in Białystok. The head of the investigation, former CBA agent and now prosecutor Elżbieta Pieniążek, is often involved in political cases on the side of the authorities. Earlier, Jakub Banaś’s home had been searched by the CBA numerous times. Banaś reported fake letters of suicide attempts being received by the NIK offices [1], [2]. The timing of the prosecution and CBA’s actions coincided with the NIK’s subsequent presentation of audit reports and successive initiation of audits. In 2023 Jakub Banaś became a candidate of the far-right Konfederacja party. His father announced publicly that “in the near future – either before or after the march organised by Civic Platform on October 1 – there is a plan being prepared to arrest my son or also my daughter-in-law, as well as some NIK employees, in order to intimidate me” .\n\nSince August 2021, the Parliament has been deciding if Marian Banaś should be stripped of his immunity, following a request by Prosecutor General Ziobro. The latest audit report published by the NIK highlighted the systemic misuse of the Justice Fund (Fundusz Sprawiedliwości) managed by Ziobro as the Minister of Justice, renowned for supporting his party’s goals instead of serving the needs of crime victims. Parliament still has not voted on Banaś’s immunity.\n\nExecutives of the Financial Supervisory Authority\n\nThis case concerns the late-2018 detention of whistle-blowers Andrzej Jakubiak and Wojciech Kwaśniak, the former president of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) and his deputy. They revealed financial crimes in the PiS-linked SKOK financial institution, which threatened the interests of PiS Senator Grzegorz Bierecki.\n\nKwaśniak, the deputy head of the KNF in 2014, barely survived a physical attack ordered by people from the management board of SKOK Wołomin.\n\nProsecutor Adam Gołuch of the Provincial Public Prosecutor’s Office in Szczecin charged Jakubiak and Kwaśniak, among others, with negligence, not completing certain administrative proceedings, and acting to the detriment of public and private interests (Art. 231 kk), allegedly allowing the loss of PLN 1.5 billion (EUR 300 million) in 2013-2014 through the SKOK institution the KNF supervised.\n\nIn February 2019, the District Court in Szczecin ruled that the detention of the two was groundless and the prosecution’s charges were unfounded.\n\nFinally, in February 2023, an organisational hearing was held in a Warsaw Court regarding the case of KNF officials, including Jakubiak and Kwaśniak. The Warsaw Court of Appeals decided in June 2023 to pay PLN 20,000 in compensation for the obviously unjustified detention of Wojciech Kwaśniak by the Ziobro Prosecutor’s Office in December 2018.\n\n1.5 Former security services chiefs\n\nFormer heads of the SKW\n\nBrigadier General Piotr Pytel, a highly decorated officer, served as the head of SKW from January 2014 until his dismissal in November 2015 when the United Right coalition took power. In December 2017, he was detained by ŻW on the orders of the Military Affairs Division of the District Prosecutor’s Office in Warsaw (since April 2016, the military prosecution is part of the common prosecution service and not a separate military structure).\n\nPytel, his predecessor Janusz Nosek, and Colonel Krzysztof Dusza — all leading the SKW — were charged in December 2017 with espionage, exceeding powers, and failing to fulfil their duties by cooperating with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). Col. Dusza was also charged with dereliction of duties following the 2010 Smoleńsk Air Disaster. The other allegations relate to an agreement signed by the SKW with the Russian service in view of the need to withdraw the Polish contingent from Afghanistan.\n\nThe first charges were brought against Gen. Nosek [For a detailed "
