        "text": "After weeks of indecision, Ukraine's allies have finally taken a stand. Several dozen Western battle tanks will be sent to help Kyiv's forces in the coming months. They will enable Ukraine to resist the onslaught of Russian troops and above all to regain the initiative in the coming spring, when the weather conditions will be more favorable for new mechanized maneuvers. The announcement was set to be made on Wednesday, January 25, by both the United States and Germany, who have managed to agree on a coalition, despite major initial differences.\n\nAccording to several US media outlets and confirmed by European sources, Washington is set to officially announce the delivery of some 30 M1 Abrams tanks on Wednesday. This announcement would constitute a shift in the American position and a disavowal for the Pentagon. According to the Wall Street Journal, American president Joe Biden made this decision following a telephone conversation on January 17 with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The equipment would be acquired through a specific security assistance program for Ukraine, without drawing on current US military stocks.\n\nFor its part, Germany would deliver a limited number of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and, above all, authorize other countries that possess them to do the same, notably Poland. According to the news website Der Spiegel, which revealed the information late on Tuesday, this decision looked set to be officially announced on Wednesday by Scholz, during a speech to the Bundestag at midday. According to the German site, Berlin intends to send at least 14 Leopard 2 tanks from the Bundeswehr's stockpile, which has a total of 320 tanks, but only 200 of which are operational.\n\nUntil very recently, the United States had been reluctant to send heavy armored vehicles to Ukraine. Difficult to maneuver, complicated to maintain and fuel-hungry, the Abrams tanks could be a poisoned chalice for the Kyiv forces, explained Colin Kahl, the Pentagon's third in command, on his return from a trip to Ukraine on January 18. \"The Abrams tank is no more difficult to use than a Leopard or a Leclerc, but its turbine consumes twice as much fuel as the diesel engines of its competitors, which requires much greater refueling logistics,\" confirmed Marc Chassillan, a French specialist in land armaments.\n\nPressure on the German Chancellor\n\nAnxious to preserve the solidity of the Western bloc, the United States decided to take the step to unblock Germany's position. Concerned about its relations with Moscow, Germany had not wanted its Leopard tanks to be the only ones sent to Ukraine. This position had been clearly explained in recent weeks by Social Democrat (SPD) Chancellor Scholz, who was adamant despite intense pressure within his governing coalition, notably from the Greens and the Liberals (FDP). If the coalition failed, Moscow could have welcomed the first serious rift between the allies in a year, according to Western sources."
