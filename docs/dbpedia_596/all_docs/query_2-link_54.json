While researching American attitudes towards Poland in terms of the complex fate of the post-World War II exiles, we found that from the American perspective the countries between Germany and Russia remained to a large extent a terra incognita, dominated by the Soviets who flagrantly violated the international wartime agreements. The American government therefore considered the area, not a particular country, to be a single problem called: “eastern Europe.” Despite the obvious differences in the east central European wartime experience, there were many similarities in its historical encounters with foreign domination and struggles for freedom that paved the way for interethnic cooperation. While examining the Cold War émigré activities, we learned that there was much more to the story of east central Europe in exile than just the practical goal of lobbying western governments for liberation of the region. We found patterns in political leaders’ biographies, forms of political alignments in exile, acculturation problems and divisions between the exiles and “ethnics”, as well as many layers of regional cooperation (political internationals, federalist organizations). Establishing cooperation with scholars from other central European countries and the U.S. in order to see a broader picture seemed indispensable. With the help of the Visegrad Fund Project Partners—Slavomír Michálek, the Institute of History of the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Bratislava, Francis Raška (Charles University in Prague), Magdolna Báráth (the Historical Archives of the Hungarian State Security in Budapest)—we decided to organize a conference at the University of GdaĔsk, Poland. The response to our Call for Papers was truly impressive. Scholars from as many as thirteen countries came to GdaĔsk to discuss east central European emigration from the perspective of their disciplines: history, sociology, political science, and literature. The four-day conference: “East Central Europe in Exile: Patterns of Transatlantic Migrations” took place at the Faculty of History at the University of Gdansk from 31 May to 3 June 2012.\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe financial support necessary for the organization of this project was provided by the Visegrad Fund (which fosters academic, cultural and scientific cooperation among the four Visegrad countries: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia); the two consecutive Deans of the Faculty of History of the University of GdaĔsk—Professor Zbigniew Opacki and Professor Wiesáaw DáugokĊcki (devoted to the advancement of the International Graduate Studies Programme in History at the University of GdaĔsk); the City of Gdynia (the founder of the Emigration Museum); and the Port of Gdansk Authority S.A. (which supports the cultural and scientific growth of the thousand-year-old city thriving on the Baltic coast). This publication was made possible by the said institutions as well as by the support received from the Pro-rector for Scientific Affairs of the University of GdaĔsk—Professor Grzegorz WĊgrzyn. Furthermore, in our effort to foster international collaboration, we enjoyed the support of many cultural and research institutions, for example: the Balassi Institute-Hungarian Cultural Institute in Warsaw, devoted to promotion of the Hungarian heritage and cooperation between Hungary and Poland in the arts and sciences; the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota, which develops archives and promotes interdisciplinary research on international migration; and the above-mentioned Emigration Museum in Gdynia, which in its scientific and cultural activities transposes the problem of emigration to explore universal experiences of life-changing travels. Moreover, we had the privilege of receiving invaluable assistance from the Museum of the City of Gdynia, the GdaĔsk History Museum, and the University of GdaĔsk History Graduate Student Association. The Honorary Patronage of the Rector of the University of GdaĔsk, the Ambassador of Hungary in Warsaw, and the Voivode of the Province of Pomerania were extended over this event. Special mention must be made of the participation of the Polish American Historical Association (PAHA), the foremost academic association based in the United States devoted to the study and advancement of the history and culture of Polish immigrants in America and their descendants and the Polish diaspora elsewhere in the world. PAHA chose to hold its annual midyear meeting in Gdansk in conjunction with the conference, and numerous PAHA members made presentations and attended sessions. The conference theme offered an inspiring common ground for studying the history of east central Europe. Poverty, wars, political persecution and intolerance recurrent in the turbulent past of Europe’s heartland pushed millions of east Europeans overseas. To examine the nature of their transatlantic migration is to obliterate the classical migration typologies\n\nEast Central Europe in Exile Volume 1: Transatlantic Migrations\n\nxvii\n\n(political / economic, forced / voluntary, temporary / permanent) and analyse the movement of people simultaneously seeking bread and freedom. The conference sessions thus revolved around issues relating to the causes of transatlantic migration, the emigrants’ travel and adaptation experiences, assimilation and acculturation processes, the political activities of the émigrés, as well as east central European cultural and artistic manifestations in the Americas. It must be acknowledged, however, that it’s not the first time that such an initiative has been taken. In 1980 a conference of Croatian, Polish, and Hungarian, Slovene and Slovak scholars on north, central, and southern European overseas emigration was held in Bratislava. It ended with a call for a continuation of cooperation. Two more meetings were held: in Kraków (1981), and in Budapest (1984). The latter resulted in the publication of papers on the great peasant transatlantic migration: Overseas Migration from East-Central and Southeastern Europe 1880– 1940 (ed. Julianna Puskás, Budapest: Akademiai Kiado, 1990). This important collection of “eastern European” essays—constituting the first step in fostering the regional approach and cooperation—necessarily focused mostly on theoretical approaches, i.e. methodology, historiography, models, and generalizations. The volume ends with a call for the continuation of exchanges, and announces an ensuing meeting in Yugoslavia. However, in the post-Communist reality, and most importantly, in light of the wars in Yugoslavia, it had by 1991 become impossible. Yet another inspiring international perspective on transatlantic migrations was offered by the participants of the Eighth International Economic History Congress in Budapest, which took place in 1982 (Ira A. Glazier and Luigi De Rosa, eds., Migration across Time and Nations. Population mobility in historical contexts (New York: Holmes & Meier, 1986)). A collection of twenty-two essays dealing primarily with the problems of analysis of migration processes offers a relevant reference point (see section: “The Migration Movements to the United States and Argentina”). A more recent, modern approach signalling new research questions resulted from a year-long colloquium, “Anatomy of Exile”, and the two conferences held in conjunction with it (Peter I. Rose, ed., The Dispossessed: An Anatomy of Exile (Amherst, Mass.: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005)). It discusses both the experience of the refugees, but also the problems of adjustments, as well as their cultural impact on the host country. In the 1990s and 2000s, with the new research opportunities available in east central Europe, including the opening of the Communist archives, many more conferences and seminars devoted to the study of transatlantic\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\npopulation movements were organized on both continents. Evidently, the focus of east central European migration research has shifted towards the study of the political emigration, also in a transnational context. Among the many scholarly initiatives at the turn of the century, one finds sessions and panels devoted to issues similar to those discussed in this volume. For example, during the Fifth World Congress of Central and East European Studies, which took place in Warsaw in 1995, scholars addressed the issue of the Communist policy towards the east central European émigrés and ethnic diasporas after the Second World War, emphasizing the need for a comparative perspective (see Adam Walaszek’s article in the “Przegląd Polonijny” (no. 2, 1996)). Furthermore, at a round table session during the Eighteenth International Congress of Historical Sciences (27 August–3 September 1995, Montreal 1995) the scholars from six states (Poland, Slovakia, Croatia, and Slovenia, the U.S. and Canada) discussed the transatlantic determinants of the east European struggles for freedom. The discussions, chaired by M. Mark Stolarik (the University of Ottawa, Canada), revolved around the impact of the émigré groups on the creation or resurrection of the states in east central Europe in the twentieth century. A complementary perspective was offered during a 2001 session: “Polish, Hungarian and Czechoslovak Political Emigration and the Origins of the Cold War”, held at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies in Washington, D.C. (see the articles by Piotr Stefan Wandycz, István Deák and Igor Lukes in the “Polish Review” (no. 47, 2002)). Recently, growing attention has been devoted to the study of interethnic cooperation and to the observation of the patterns of east central European transatlantic migrations. In 2008, Ieva Zake (AntiCommunist Minorities in the U.S.: Political Activism of Ethnic Refugees, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) organized a seminar devoted to the study of anti-communism among the various ethnics in the U.S. Two years later, an edited volume devoted to the study of the intelligence uses of the exiles entitled: Secret weapon or the victims of the Cold War? Central and Eastern European political émigrés was published in Poland (Lublin: IPN, 2010). It was the result of an international conference organized in Lublin by Sáawomir àukasiewicz, who managed to gather esteemed researchers of political emigration from the east central Europe. Our volumes, undoubtedly inspired by the above-mentioned collections, are different in scope, character, and offer less specialized, but broader and more complementary perspectives: east central European and American. They are not theoretical studies; they do not examine contemporary migration trends. Neither one repeats the largely quantitative studies on\n\nEast Central Europe in Exile Volume 1: Transatlantic Migrations\n\nxix\n\ncontinental and overseas emigration from east central Europe. Furthermore, neither tries to juxtapose east central European experience with that of other nations of the region, say Russia or Germany. It is not the sole fact of a life in exile, but the east central European heritage in transatlantic transition is the essential thread in both volumes. However, just like our predecessors, we share the conviction that international cooperation of the scholars of various disciplines, who work on east central European overseas migration, should continue. Moreover, we believe it to be of the utmost importance to publish our findings in English, which obviously has become the new lingua franca, thus allowing for the extended exchange of ideas and results of research. The list of contributors to our post-conference volumes is a vital sign that the seeds of effective international cooperation are already sprouting. The two post-conference volumes, published under the same heading: East Central Europe in Exile, contain a collection of chapters written by both esteemed, and well-known scholars, as well as young, aspiring researchers whose work brings a fresh, innovative approach to the study of migration. The volumes are not interdisciplinary in their character. Rather, they are multi-disciplinary in that each academic field retains its own methodology and unique vantage point. While some of the texts are based on thorough archival research, some synthesize the current state of research, whereas others—more impressionistic in character—offer inspiration, pointing the reader to new sources and approaches in studying migration. Altogether, there are thirty-eight chapters in both volumes focusing on the east central European émigré experience in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The very same experience which led to the formation of east central Europe in exile—a powerful ethnic conglomerate of people pushed out of the region by poverty, war, persecution, who maintained their transatlantic links in a variety of forms. The first volume, Transatlantic Migrations, focuses on the reasons for emigration from the lands of east central Europe; from the Baltic to the Adriatic, the intercontinental journey, as well as on the initial adaptation and assimilation processes. It consists of twenty chapters written by scholars from eight different countries, organized into four parts. The first part may be considered a broad introduction to the two volume series. Based on captivating individual stories presented against historical background, the authors demonstrate reasons for emigration from eastern Europe, look into its changing character, examine the nature of the preserved transatlantic links, and touch upon adaptation processes. Jože Pirjevec opens the section with a broad introduction to the changing\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\nnature of south-eastern emigration overseas. The theme of exile ties and activities carried out on behalf of the old country is further expanded in the chapter by Agata Biernat. In the next chapter Harriet Napierkowski describes how international conflicts uproot people from the moving, personal perspective of a single displaced family, which is representative of thousands more in the aftermath of the Second World War. It is followed by an examination of the post-war and anti-communist emigration routes, which in the case of north-eastern Europe often led through Sweden. Arnold KáonczyĔski describes both the factors pushing the Poles to leave their homelands, as well as the reasons for their subsequent departure from Sweden to America. The next chapter, by Slavomír Michálek describes the successful attempts to organize help for the cold war refugees—mostly from Czechoslovakia—in the second half of the twentieth century. Béla Nóvé’s chapter presents the dramatic plight of underage Hungarians escaping the country during and after the Hungarian Revolution. The first part of the volume concludes with Maja Trochimczyk’s study of Polish émigré musicians. The author examines the reasons for their migration overseas, their careers in the adopted homeland, and their new, negotiated identities—émigré, ethnic, or American—thus indicating the essential elements of “Polishness”. In the second part of the first volume, the reader will discover the various aspects of the transatlantic passage from the departure ports, types of vessels, conditions aboard to the difficulties involved in getting to America. Interestingly, the five contributors, from four different countries, describe the intercontinental crossing from different places and perspectives. Taken together, this helps the reader to visualize the various aspects of the international migratory network combining east central Europe with the Americas. This part opens with an examination of the emigrant traffic via the south-eastern European ports. Aleksej Kalc’s article focuses on the significance of Trieste, whereas Istvan Kornel Vida’s chapter mostly deals with Rijeka (Fiume). While the first one focuses on the volume and economic significance of the passenger traffic, the latter examines the humanitarian side of the transatlantic voyage. Two articles dealing with north-eastern European ports—GdaĔsk and Gdynia— complement this perspective. Again, however, both authors adopt quite a different approach. Whereas Oskar Myszor’s detailed study presents the volume of emigrant traffic through the Polish port of Gdynia, Jan Daniuk tells the story of the German emigration from the Free City of Danzig to Brazil. The difficulties faced by the settlers in the Brazilian jungle are further juxtaposed with the care east central European immigrants received in North America. Anne M. Gurnack offers a glimpse of how New York\n\nEast Central Europe in Exile Volume 1: Transatlantic Migrations\n\nxxi\n\ncoped with the health-care needs of the scores of immigrants arriving in America via Ellis Island, and what medical services were available to them around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The third part, “Putting Roots Down”, focuses on processes of adaptation and acculturation. M. B. B. Biskupski’s article opens the discussion by posing questions on the nature of the transatlantic connection to the “old country”. The author observes changes in political consciousness and clearly demonstrates the detachment from the “ancestral Fatherland”. Mary Patrice Erdmans looks into the phenomena of “Polishness” in Connecticut over the course of a hundred and forty years. This broad perspective is then confronted with detailed studies of immigrant communities in other parts of the United States. Dorota Praszaáowicz’s article looks at the complex relations between the Poles and Germans in Milwaukee at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As both above-mentioned authors emphasize the central role of the parish in the ethnic community, their perspectives are complemented by Daniel ýerny’s case study of the struggle for the preservation of identity by a group of Slovak immigrants, the members of the Slovak Greek Catholic Church in Canada. The last part of the volume examines immigrant paths towards integration. The authors discuss the east Europeans’ entry into various labour markets (mostly in low-skilled jobs) as well as immigrant social mobility and career patterns. Pien Versteegh examines education and the career patterns of the Polish workers in Pennsylvania and compares it with that of the American workers. The American experience is then contrasted with an examination of various perspectives of the social mobility of the Polish immigrants in Europe. Brian McCook presents a detailed study of the education patterns in Great Britain during and after the Second World War. Silvia Dapía’s chapter characterizes the socio-political reasons behind Argentina’s decision to encourage immigration from east central Europe in the late twentieth century. The volume closes with an article by Maágorzata Patok, who looks into the contemporary relevance of the Polish immigrant stereotype in the West and examines the role it plays in ameliorating integration strategies. Undoubtedly, this compilation fosters the reader’s understanding of the transnational processes affecting the east central European migrants. It proves that patterns in the east central European transatlantic migration are easily discernible, and that seeing our history within the regional context is therefore crucial. The second volume is slightly different in scope, for it focuses on the aspect of negotiating new identities acquired in the adopted homeland. The\n\nxxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nauthors contributing to the: Transtatlantic Indentities focus on the preservation of the east central European identity, maintenance of the contacts with the “old country”, and activities pursued on behalf of, and for the sake of the abandoned homeland. The first part of the volume opens with a study of east central European cultural activities in the U.S. and the importance of ethnic heritage in the artistic and literary creations. Thomas J. Napierkowski talks about the presence of the exile experience in Polish-American literature. In her chapter, Jelena Šesniü supports his perspective, which discusses Croatian literature as a transculturated discourse. The literary portrayal of immigrants based on semiautobiographical fiction is focus of in the article by GraĪyna J. Kozaczka. It examines the negotiated, or constructed, immigrant identity. Then, Anna D. JaroszyĔska-Kirchmann, using emigrant and exile written exchanges within their communities, looks into the internal development of the Polish political diaspora by analysing the informal communication networks within it. The Czech perspective on intra-diasporic exchanges is then offered by Francis Raška, who describes the debates involving the Czechoslovak intellectual elites. This section of the book closes with Piotr Koprowski’s examination of the thoughts on the east central European intellectual identity formulated by a Polish Catholic philosopher during his transatlantic travels. East central European émigré attitudes towards other ethnic minorities are discussed in the second part of this volume. This section opens with a study of Polish cooperation with other ethnic groups before the American Civil War, written by James S. Pula. It is followed by Piotr Derengowski’s article on the Polish opinions about slavery in the Civil War era. Stephen M. Leahy further expands this perspective in his article discussing the relationship between the Polish-Americans and African Americans during this era. Sociologist Ieva Zake’s article, concluding this section, offers a comprehensive, synthesizing approach to the problem of the nature of ethnic prejudice. The third part of the volume focuses on the political manifestations of the émigré overseas. Particular attention is directed towards interethnic cooperation among the east central European exiles during the Cold War. The section opens with Martin Nekola’s article, which focuses on political leadership of the Czech and Slovak exiles. Anna Siwik and Arkadiusz Indraszczyk discuss the interethnic cooperation of the east central European exiles based on their political views, the socialist and agrarian respectively. Anna Mazurkiewicz talks about the united exiles efforts to garner the attention of the United Nations for the cause of liberation of east central Europe. Pauli Heikkilä closes this section of the volume\n\nEast Central Europe in Exile Volume 1: Transatlantic Migrations\n\nxxiii\n\ndescribing the multi-ethnic Assembly of the Captive European Nations as a U.S. based exile organization of noticeable importance in Europe. The last four articles therefore combine east central European exile political activities on both sides of the Atlantic. The last part of the second volume is devoted to an examination of the link between the Cold War exiles and the intelligence services—both American and Communist—thus exemplifying another transatlantic link. Katalin Kádár Lynn discusses the cooperation of the Hungarian leader— Tibor Eckhardt and Grombach organization, or “the Pond”. Magdolna Báráth supplements this perspective by describing Communist attempts to severely inhibit emigration from Hungary after the revolution of 1956. In keeping with the chronological sequence, the Hungarian case is supported by Patryk Pleskot’s study of the Polish intelligence service’s surveillance of the Polish diaspora in the 1980s. Taken together, these eighteen essays present the reader with a panorama of émigré co-operation and conflict in exile. The scholars from eight different countries thus present the results of their most recent research in the field of interethnic interactions of the émigrés which—had it not been for the GdaĔsk meeting—would otherwise only appear as part of their national historiographies. While each of the volumes can function independently, they serve the purpose of presenting diversified and multinational perspectives best when read together. This publication was prepared for readers interested in European, as well as American, history (political, cultural, and economic). Furthermore, as the two-volume set offers diversified perspectives, cutting across disciplines and national borders, it may serve as a background for exciting discussions in academic courses and as an enjoyable inspiration to further research on both sides of the Atlantic. On behalf of the organizing committee, we would like to thank all of the conference participants, partners and sponsors. We would also like to express gratitude to Ewa Barczyk (Director of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries) and to Daniel Necas (Research Archivist at the Immigration History Research Center, University of Minnesota) whose personal efforts were instrumental in helping us locate and obtain copies and permissions to use the photographs on the covers. It ought to be recorded that the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee library, represented at the conference by Director Barczyk, houses the Roman Kwasniewski Photographic Collection, an extensive treasure trove of visual images of the Polish neighbourhood of Milwaukee in its heyday, the early decades of the 20th century. Last but not least, our thanks go to Peter Simon for his assistance in correcting the texts for both volumes.\n\nxxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe hope that the volumes that resulted from our discussions at the University of GdaĔsk constitute an important step in the direction of closer international cooperation as well as a clear indication of the critical need for transnational research. —Anna Mazurkiewicz, Mieczysáaw Nurek\n\nPART I: EMIGRANTS, EXILES, REFUGEES\n\nCHAPTER ONE SLOVENIAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL MIGRATION TO THE AMERICAS IN THE LAST 150 YEARS JOŽE PIRJEVEC\n\nThe urge to abandon one’s native land for religious, economic or political reasons has a long tradition in east and central Europe. The history of emigration from Slovenia is no different, from the Protestants, who sought refuge in Germany, Scandinavia and North America in the second half of the sixteenth century, to the Roman Catholic missionaries, who decided to follow their vocation and go overseas to convert pagans. The latter emigration started as early as the seventeenth century but the process intensified in the nineteenth. The most famous among them was Frederik Jernej Baraga, who went to Michigan in 1830 where he preached among the local Indian tribes. For decades he endured extremely harsh conditions, publishing books in Native American languages and fighting for their human rights.1 During the nineteenth century, many poor Slovenian peasants and tradesmen used to abandon their villages every year from spring until autumn in order to find work in different parts of the Habsburg Empire, Germany, France and even in southern Russia. However, the first major emigration wave occurred in the 1880s. Up to the outbreak of the First World War, 300,000 people had left southern and north-eastern Slovenia for the USA, Brazil, Westphalia, and even Egypt. This last migratory stream encompassed mostly young women from the Adriatic Littoral, who were employed by wealthy families (especially in Alexandria) as nurses to their infant children.2\n\n1\n\nBernard J. Lambert, Shepherd of the Wilderness: A Biography of Bishop Frederic Baraga (Chicago: Franciscan Herald Press, 1974). 2 Dorica Makuc, Aleksandrinke (Gorica: GMD, 2006).\n\n4\n\nChapter One\n\nAfter the Great War, when the United States decided to regulate the flow of immigrants, many Slovenians found it easier to settle in western Europe, Canada, Argentina and Brazil. To the last two countries went those Slovenians from the Adriatic Littoral in particular, which was occupied and annexed by Italy after 1918. Hence the reason for their migration was not only economic but also political. In fact, at the very beginning of its rule in Venezia Giulia (as the Littoral has been renamed), Italy began a policy of ethnic assimilation, which became especially oppressive after October 1922 when the Fascists came to power. They destroyed the Slovenian cultural, political and economic infrastructure in the province, compelling many citizens and intellectuals, to seek refuge in Yugoslavia and, as previously mentioned, in North and Latin America. It is reckoned that in the 1920s and 30s at least 80,000 Slovenians from the Littoral decided to abandon Venezia Giulia in order to escape the hardships of the Mussolini’s regime. This constituted a quarter of the entire minority that came under Italian rule after World War I.3 The main reason for the great wave of emigration during the last two decades of the nineteenth century and before the First World War was the economic crisis, which had the worst effect on the peasants. Once in America, these emigrants rarely decided to settle in rural areas but rather found work in industry—particularly in mining and the steel mills. Not carrying any social security, they quickly began to organize mutual aid associations. By the end of the nineteenth century, a first such association was founded in the United States under the tutelage of the Catholic clergy. However, the ideological divisions typical of the “old country” also found expression in the new—in 1904, a liberal version of the above–mentioned association had already been created in Chicago. Also, during the same period, the first Slovenian Socialist club came into being. Not long after, in 1911, it joined the American Socialist Party. These and other similar groups developed a lively cultural milieu, publishing newspapers and books, organizing choirs for their members, as well as theatre, gymnastic and sports events. They transferred the rich social life typical of Slovenian society from the sunset of the Habsburg Empire to their new environment overseas.4 The most prominent representative of the first generation of emigrants was Louis Adamic, who came to the United States in 1913 at the age of 3\n\nMilica Kacin Wohinz, Jože Pirjevec, Storia degli sloveni in Italia, 1866–1998 (Venezia: Marsilio, 1998). 4 Matjaž Klemenþiþ, Slovenes of Cleveland: the Creation of a New Nation and a New World Community (Novo mesto: Dolenjska založba, Ljubljana Scientific Institute of the Faculty of Arts, 1995).\n\nSlovenian Economic and Political Migration to the Americas\n\n5\n\nfifteen, after having been expelled from Austrian schools for his membership in a pro-Yugoslav student movement. At first, he worked as a manual labourer, and later as a journalist at a Slovenian daily newspaper published in New York. As a volunteer soldier he participated in combat on the Western Front during the First World War. Afterwards, he worked as a professional writer. In 1932, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and two years later achieved national acclaim for his book The Native’s Return.5 In it, he records a journey to his homeland and a critical evaluation of the corrupt regime of King Alexander Karaÿjorÿjevic, whom he called a “mafia boss”. The book, which appeared at the time of the King’s violent death in Marseilles, was an instant best seller, providing many Americans with their first knowledge of the Balkans. Its success opened the doors of the White House to Adamic. During the Second World War, he supported the anti-fascist struggle of the Yugoslav peoples and the establishment of a Socialist federation. In support of Marshall Tito, he founded the United Committee of South Slavic Americans. After 1945, he strongly opposed the course of western foreign policy initiated by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and tried to convince the American leadership not to fall into the trap of the Cold War. His 1946 book, entitled Dinner at the White House containing the report of a conversation with President Roosevelt and Churchill caused quite a stir.6 The author accused the British prime minister of suppressing the communist movement in Greece in order to preserve his financial interests in the country. In 1949, Adamic returned to Yugoslavia in order to see what had happened in the country after the Tito-Stalin split. Upon his return, he wrote another book entitled: The Eagle and the Roots, which contained his recollections and impressions of his discussions with Marshall Tito.7 He had completed this book just before his mysterious and violent death in September 1951. It is still unclear whether Adamic committed suicide by shooting himself, or whether he was shot by his enemies. In any case, it is worth mentioning that he had been under FBI surveillance for many years as a potential security threat and a leftist.8\n\n5\n\nLouis Adamic, The Native’s Return (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1934).

As early as 1917, a group of Socialists led by the remarkable Etbin Kristan, (the only Slovenian mentioned by Lenin in his writings), published the so-called “Chicago Declaration”, which favoured uniting southern Slavs in one republic. During the period between the two world wars, this Association was joined by many émigré Croats and Serbs who had vehemently opposed the dictatorship of King Alexander and had been fighting for the “just” borders of the Slovenian nation, which was then divided between Yugoslavia, Italy and Austria in the aftermath of the collapse of the Habsburg Empire. When in April 1941 Hitler and Mussolini attacked Yugoslavia, the Slovenian emigrants in Cleveland (where they were particularly numerous) immediately organized a Committee with the aim of helping the occupied country. Of course, the ideological struggles that split Slovenians at home during the Second World War were not foreign to them. Those who joined the Liberation Front, led by the Communists, were opposed by the Roman Catholic clergy and conservatives. The latter hoped that after the war an independent Slovenia would eventually be created within the framework of federal Yugoslavia and under the protection of Great Britain and the United States. Both groups, however, claimed new borders for the country, stressing the need to redraw those that had been established after the First World War. In order to achieve this, they developed a lively propaganda, engaging in a polemical struggle with Italian emigrants, who, for their part, were in favour of the conservation of the Rapallo border, as it had been agreed upon by Rome and Belgrade in November 1920. Following the Yugoslav “Partisans” occupation of Trieste and the Gorizia area (1 May–12 June 1945), and their subsequent withdrawal, which was caused by the Allies’ threat to use military force if necessary, the Trieste issue became especially acrimonious for years to mutual relations among the émigrés.9 The end of the Second World War was a new chapter in the history of Slovenian emigration. By then, the majority of the second or third generation descendants of economic emigrants, who decided to abandon their homeland for the USA, Canada, or Latin America, had already began achieving remarkable success. They actively participated in the intellectual, military and political affairs of their countries, often occupying high posts as legislators and governors, etc. An interesting case study is that of 9\n\nKlemenþiþ, \"Research on Slovene Immigration to the United States: Post Achivements and Future Direction,” Slovene Studies 8, no. 2 (1986): 9–14.\n\nSlovenian Economic and Political Migration to the Americas\n\n7\n\nAndrew Kobal. He was born in 1899 and fought during the First World War as an Austrian soldier on the Isonzo front. After the war his village came under Italian rule hence, he was forced to flee to Yugoslavia and later to America. In the U.S., he began working in Slovenian cultural organizations, but after a short time decided to devote his time to studying (history, psychology, economy and political science). Eventually, he achieved four doctoral degrees. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was employed by the Pentagon in the Department for Psychological Warfare. In 1944, he became a member of the Office of Strategic Services. In this capacity, he worked in the Balkans and in Asia, and—as a highly successful intelligence officer—became one of the founders of the CIA.10 By the end of the Second World War, many right-wing Slovenians, who had collaborated with Italian and German occupiers, tried to escape to Carinthia or Italy, hoping to be accepted by the Allies as well. The majority of those who fled to Carinthia (about 11,000) were returned to Yugoslavia by the British and massacred by the Partisans. Those fortunate enough to survive fled mainly to Argentina but also to the USA, Canada and Australia. The Vatican, whose authorities did not bother to ask what they had been doing during the War, often made their escape possible. This is how people like Gregorij Rožman, the Bishop of Ljubljana, who openly collaborated with the occupiers, helping to foster the civilian war in Slovenia, managed to find asylum in America. This new wave of migration, which numbered nearly 13,000 people, was quite different from the earlier ones, since its members were often highly educated with strong political motivations. Hence, they did not mix with the older “economic” emigration groups but created their own organizations, schools and newspapers in the countries where they settled. They had no intention of remaining overseas but wanted to return to their homeland and to exact revenge. It is fair to say that, in general, they were quite successful, developing a lively economic and cultural life and managing to pass their unique identity on to the next generation. While like the Croatian and Serbian émigrés they were in fierce opposition to Marshall Tito’s regime, they did not share or cultivate either Ustasha, or Chetnik traditions.11 They remained peaceful, strongly believing that their exile was a temporary one, and that, therefore, it was important to preserve their ideological and cultural heritage. In accordance with this attitude, they followed political and intellectual life in Slovenia with great 10\n\nAndrew Kobal, Svetovni popotnik pripoveduje, vols. I–II (Gorica: GMD, 1975– 1976). 11 Pirjevec, “Yugoslav Political Emigration to Australia after World War II,” Annales. Series Historia and Sociologia 16, no. 1 (2006): 1–6.\n\n8\n\nChapter One\n\nattention, especially cultivating strong ties with frontier cities such as Trieste, Gorizia and Klagenfurt. Located on the borders of Yugoslavia, these Italian and Austrian cities were the homes to many Slovenians. With the help of many sympathizers, the political exiles were able to smuggle their publications into Slovenia, thus exercising some minor influence on the homeland. Obviously, aware of such activity, the Yugoslav authorities tried to hinder these ties by any means. When in 1991 socialist Yugoslavia collapsed, Slovenian emigrants participated in the creation of an independent Slovenia with great emotional involvement. They were using their contacts and influence, especially in the USA, to convince the George H. W. Bush administration to recognize the new-born state. Moreover, they tried to play a certain political role in the democratic and pluralist society, which emerged from the ruins of Yugoslavia, linking themselves with Catholic and conservative parties. Although some Cold War political exiles actually returned to the old country, this phenomenon was not as marked as in the case of Croatia or Serbia. Nevertheless, for a short time two important posts in the country—the Prime Minister (Andrej Bajuk) and the Bishop of Ljubljana (Cardinal Alojz Rode)—were occupied by men who had arrived from Argentina. The majority of the Slovenian emigrants were, however, so integrated in their adopted countries that it was almost unthinkable for them to return to the old country. Although the third or the fourth generation of the emigrants generally no longer speaks Slovenian, many of them preserved their Slovenian identity and continued to participate in numerous organizations operating overseas. Some of them are known both in their country of residence as well as in Slovenia. Such is the case of Father Pedro Oblak, born in Argentina, who works in Madagascar with the poorest children who must scavenge in dumps in order to survive.12 The Slovenian migration to the Americas, as shown in this short review, followed a typical pattern of the waves of central European migration. Until the Second World War it retained a mostly economic character, except for the people from the Littoral, annexed after 1920 by Italy, fleeing the fascist regime. After 1945 the nature of emigration changed dramatically as several thousand political emigrants sought escape from the Communist regime.\n\n12 Marjan Javornik, Alenka Dermastia, “Izseljenci v Južni Ameriki,” in Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 4, (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1990).\n\nCHAPTER TWO ALBANIA AND ALBANIAN ÉMIGRÉS IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE WORLD WAR II AGATA BIERNAT\n\nAlong with different political, religious or economic problems, Albanian history reflects the causes of emigrations. The origin of the Albanians is still a matter of dispute. Most historians think that they are descendants of the Illyrians, Dacians or Thracians; Albanians believe their origin is Illyrian. In ancient times, Albania was a part of the Roman Empire, falling later under Byzantine authority. For most of their history Albanians were a small nationality struggling for recognition under the Ottoman Empire. Unfortunately, they failed to attract the support of the European powers. It should be remembered that from 1478, soon after the death of Skanderbeg, until 1912, Albania was a part of the Ottoman Empire, which for almost five centuries affected the political, cultural, social and especially religious life of the Albanians. Indeed by the early twentieth century, the majority of Albanians were Muslim.1 At that time, the Albanians were divided (and still are) into two main groups: Gegs and Tosks. They spoke different dialects of the same language. The Gegs lived in the northern part of Albania, mostly in the mountains, and were characterized by a strong tribal organization. However Tosks were not so conservative, lived in the south, and most of them were peasants.2\n\n1 Charles H.

No equivalent tradition existed in relation to Albania comparable to the Philhellenism of the political elites of Europe that provided constant support for Greek nationalism or the pan-Slavism movement in Russia that did the same for Serbian aspirations.3\n\nThe end of the nineteenth century was a milestone in Albanian history, for this is when they started to fight for their rights. In the beginning, the Albanian national movement did not seek the collapse of the Ottoman Empire or to declare independence.4 Compared with the Serbian, Bulgarian or Greek national movements, it was unique. To the Albanians, autonomy within the Ottoman state appeared to be the only guarantee of their national security. In April 1878, Albanian patriots living in Constantinople organized a secret committee—the Committee for the Defence of the Rights of the Albanian People. The committee was headed by Abdyl Frashëri with his younger brother Sami Frashëri, together with Pashko Vasa, Jani Vreto, Kostandin Kristoforidhi, and others, and was soon expanded and transformed into a new organization.5 In the spring of 1878, the Albanian delegates met in Prizren before the opening of the European Congress in Berlin in June. The result of this meeting was the creation of the Albanian League for the Defence of the Rights of the Albanian Nationality, also known as the League of Prizren (or the Albanian League). This was when Abdyl Frashëri declared that from now on there were no “Muslim claims”, but rather “Albanian claims”. The new activity was to protect Albanian lands and found an autonomous Albanian vilayet with its own army and police.6\n\n3 Amanda Vickers and James Pettifer, Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity (New York: New York University Press, 1997), 1–2. 4 Jelavich and Jelavich, The Establishment, 222. 5 Edwin E.

They tried to convince the western powers that they were a separate nation from the Turks, which was not easy at that time. However, some scholars who had been in Albania observed a difference between Albanians and other nations living in the Balkans. Thus, following his visits to Albania, Arthur John Evans, a British scholar, published his Illirian Letters in 1878, in which he shared his impressions: Everything reminds me that I am not among either a Slavic or a Turkish people. These are truly fellows—patriots of Skanderbeg and of Ali of Yanina—Albanians, “Shiptarë”, heirs as strong as rock, a most warlike race and altogether undefeated! […] The Albanian is by nature quick, energetic, sceptical, always in motion, impatient with supervision. For him, above everything else is freedom.7\n\nAlbanians strove to emphasize that they wanted to be perceived as neither Turks nor Slavs but simply as Albanians. On 10 June 1878, an assembly in Prizren (Kosovo) sent just such a message to the Congress of Berlin. Prizren was then still a province of the Turkish Empire. Unfortunately, the congress was not at all impressed. Bismarck dismissed the message with a curt remark: “There is no Albanian nationality”.8 Albanians did not accept the treaties of San Stefano and Berlin, because both assigned areas—also inhabited by Albanians—to other states and thus the Albanians decided to continue fight for recognition.9 The Ottomans, who decided to send the army to crush the Albanian League, further endangered their aspirations. Abdyl Frashëri was captured and then sentenced to death, which was later changed to life imprisonment.10\n\n7\n\nJacques, 257. “The Eastern Question again,” http://www.slobodan-milosevic.org/news/economist 061078.htm (accessed 5 May 2012). 9 According to Article 1 of the Treaty of San Stefano “gave to Montenegro the district of Dulcigno, Tivari, Hot, Plava and Gucinja.

However, it encompassed only half of the regions containing Albanian populations. The treaty also predominantly split Albanian Kosovo between Serbia and Montenegro.12 Prince William of Wied, a major in the German Guards, was nominated by the Great Powers to rule Albania. Soon afterwards he arrived at Durazzo (the Albanian city Durrës), where he established the country’s capital. As his regime was a total failure, internal disorder forced him into exile just after the outbreak of the Great War. Finally, Albanian territorial integrity was confirmed when it joined the League of Nations in 1920. In the interwar period, Ahmet Zogu, a conservative leader, ruled Albania. In September 1928, the Constituent Assembly proclaimed Albania a “democratic, parliamentary and hereditary kingdom”, and subsequently proclaimed Ahmet Zogu king with the royal title “Zog the First, King of the Albanians”.13 Zog’s dictatorial rule was marked by economic stagnation and Italian influence over Albanian affairs. By the time of Italy’s invasion in 1939, the country was a de facto Italian protectorate.14 The written accounts of the Albanian migration to America before the Second World War are very limited, and the statistics quoted here should be treated with caution.15 The collected material is often part of history books or travel accounts, written primarily by foreign scholars or travellers. As the Ottoman Empire crumbled, distant places such as the Americas and Australia became the preferred emigration destinations for Albanians. Although the U.S. became the single most important destination in the Americas, Albanian settlements were also created in Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, and Mexico.16 Compared with other east European nations, few Albanians came to the United States before the twentieth century. The first Albanian emigrant 11\n\nIbid., 13. The Albanians have never accepted the prejudice to their people, and today its nationalists are intent on “rectifying” the “historical injustice”.

His arrival in the U.S. sometime in the mid-1880s was to become the start of a considerable chain of migration as fellow villagers followed him, their imagination and desire set on fire as he reported on the wonders of America. But the first recorded Albanian to arrive in the United States was Koli Kristofer (Nicholas Christopher), who arrived in Boston in 1886 from the town of Katundi.18 Six years later, he returned to his motherland and spoke of the wonders of the “new world” to his countrymen. He later went back to Boston, accompanied by seventeen other Albanians.19 Emigration to the United States started in the late nineteenth century. Generally, before World War I, Albanians mainly migrated to America because of poor economic conditions, but also for political reasons, or to escape military conscription in the Turkish army, with the hope of bettering their situation while discovering greater opportunities and democratic freedom.20 Most of them immigrated to America in order to find a job, most commonly in factories. They were predominantly Orthodox young men who hoped to return home after they saved some money overseas. The majority of the early Albanian immigrants who reached the U.S. had a rural background and little knowledge of literary Albanian. Albanian immigrants to United States settled principally in New England, the New York area, and the industrial cities of the Midwest. Boston became a centre for Orthodox Christian Albanians, while Detroit became the most important city for Muslim Albanians. It was in this city that the first Albanian Bektashi Tekke was created in 1949. Four years later, a Sufi centre of the Bektashi Order was founded.21 The first wave of 17\n\nIbid.

The majority of the Muslims who left Albania did so for economic rather than political reasons. The second wave of Albanian transatlantic migration began after the Second World War. The majority of the immigrants chose to settle in the Greater Boston area. By 1907, several hundred Albanians worked in the mills of New England, in its factories or restaurants and hotels.22 Most of the early Albanian immigrants to the United States were illiterate. According to Denna Page, in 1906 there were 5,000 Albanians in America and only 20 of them could read or write in their own language.23 By 1919, 15,000 out of 40,000 Albanians could read and write in their own language. At first, the Albanians also remained suspicious of the American way of life and were often reluctant to send their children to American schools.24 Gradually, they accepted the fact that education provided the foundation for a better life in America. The first Albanian weekly newspaper, “Kombi” (The Nation) began publishing in Boston, in 1906. Its founder, Sotir Peci, a graduate of the University of Athens was instrumental in instilling a sense of Albanian nationhood among his fellow nationals and in encouraging the spread of literacy in Albanian. Also in Boston, the first Albanian drama “Israelites and Philistines”, by Fan S. Noli, was staged in 1907.25 A year later, the Christian Albanians living in USA established their own Church. In 1907, Kristaq Dishnica, a young Albanian man, died of influenza in Hudson, Massachusetts.26 The local Greek Orthodox priest refused to officiate at the funeral services because Dishnica was an Albanian nationalist (or as some might say, a patriot), and as such he was considered excommunicated. He was laid to rest in a Worcester cemetery without any religious service. It became known as the “Hudson Incident” and pushed other Albanians to take action and try to change the situation. On 8 March 1908, Fan Noli was asked to lead the movement for a separatist Albanian Orthodox Church in Boston. He was ordained to the priesthood by Platon, the Russian Archbishop of New York, and the Saint 22\n\nNadege Ragaru and Amilda Dymi, “The Albanian-American Community in the United States: A Diaspora Coming to Visibility,” Sciences Po 3, http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/14/75/88/PDF/The_AlbanianAmerican_Community_in_the_United_States.pdf (accessed 12 October 2012). 23 Jurgens, “Albanian Americans.” 24 Ibid. 25 Ibid. 26 “History of the Parish,” St. George Cathedral, http://www.saintgeorgecathedral.com/history.html (accessed 10 May 2012).\n\nAlbania and Albanian Émigrés in the United States before World War II\n\n15\n\nGeorge Albanian Orthodox Church was organized at the Knights of Honor Hall on Tremont Street in Boston.27 At that time, he first celebrated the liturgy in Albanian.

During the Congress of Berat (Albania) in 1922, the goals for the formation of the Church of Albania were discussed and autocephaly of the Albanian Orthodox Church was officially proclaimed. In November 1923, Noli was consecrated bishop of Korçë and named Primate of All Albania.29 But it took another 15 years before this was finally recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, which happened on 13 April 1937 when the Patriarch of Constantinople accepted the Albanian Orthodox Church as autocephalous.30 Finally, the impasse between these two institutions was overcome. At the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century, several national associations of the Albanian community started their political activities in the United States. The two most prominent figures, who greatly influenced the development of the Albanian national movement in the U.S. at that time, were Noli and Faik Konitza. Fan Noli (also known as Theophan Stylian Noli), mentioned above, instrumental in the establishment of the Albanian Orthodox Church, was a leader of the Albanian-American community and undoubtedly an important figure in Albanian literature, culture, religious life and politics.31 Noli arrived in Boston in 1906 and soon became deputy editor of the Albanian journal “Kombi”. He also edited other magazines, like: “The Adriatic Review” and “Dielli” (Sun).32 In 1912, he graduated from Harvard 27 The church later evolved into Saint George Albanian Orthodox Cathedral –the seat of the Albanian Orthodox Archdiocese in America–which eventually relocates to South Boston, in Van Christo, “Chronology: The Albanians of Boston,” Frosina Information Network, http://www.frosina.org/articles/default.asp?id=172 (accessed 10 May 2012). 28 “History of the Parish.” 29 Ibid. 30 Raymond Hutchins, “The Albanian Orthodox Autocephalous Church,” Frosina Information Network, http://www.frosina.org/about/infobits.asp?id=148 (accessed 12 May 2012). 31 Robert Elsie, “Fan Noli, ” Albanian language, http://www.albanianlanguage.net/en/noli.html (accessed 16 May 2012). 32 Noli “Shqipëria i ka borxh Amerikës,” Illyria, November–December 2007, 64.

He strove to secure Albania’s pace in the League of Nations and to convince President Woodrow Wilson to defend the country’s interests at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.33 After World War I, Noli decided to return to Albania. Upon his return, he was able to form his own political party, the Democratic and Liberal Party. Soon after, he became Albania’s premier (June to December 1924), where he led a democratic government, which tried to cope with the economic and political problems facing the Albanian state. On Christmas Eve, 1924, he was overthrown by Zogist supporters and sentenced to death. He fled to Italy, thus leaving Albania for good.34 Then for a couple of years he lived in Vienna. When Noli finally returned to Boston he decided to focus on his activity in the Albanian Orthodox Church. He also returned to his favourite hobby—music. He even entered the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston from which he graduated in 1938.35 Moreover, seven years later (1945) he finished his doctoral thesis on the most famous Albanian national hero—Skanderbeg: the book became a classic. Besides his political, religious and historiographical record, until his death at the age of 83, Noli was also recognized as a dramatist, poet, historian and, in particular, a translator who made a significant contribution to the development of the Albanian literary language.36 In 1924, the Manchester Guardian described Fan Noli:\n\n33\n\nNathan Thrall, “Albania, the Muslim World’s Most Pro-American State,” 4 September 2009, Slate, http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches /features/2009/albania_the_muslim_worlds_most_proamerican_state/americas_51st_ state.html (accessed 19 May 2012). 34 Elsie, Historical Dictionary of Albania, (New York: Scarecrow Press, 2004), 331. 35 Ibid. 36 Elsie, “Fan Noli,” Albanian language…; Owen Pearson, Albania as Dictatorship and Democracy: From Isolation to the Kosovo War, 1946–1998 (London: I.B.

It has to be mentioned that he was published and received accolades from literary critic George Bernard Shaw, author Thomas Mann and composer Jan Sibelius.

An accomplished diplomat, an expert in international politics, a skilful debater, who from the outset made a deep impression in Geneva. He knocked down his Balkan opponents in a masterful fashion, but always with a broad smile. He is a man of vast culture who has read everything in English and French.37\n\nFaik Konitza, also known as Faik Salko or Faik bey Konica, was another admired and multitalented figure in Albanian history. He was born in 1876 in Konitza (Alb. Konica, present-day northern Greece, near the Albanian border).38 He came from one of the most important Muslim families of the Ottoman Empire, which is why he was able to receive a comprehensive education. He graduated from a Jesuit School in Shkodra. Then he also studied in Constantinople (at the French-language Imperial Galata secondary school) and in France. He studied in Lisieux and Carcassonne, and graduated in Romance philology from the University of Dijon in 1895. Afterwards, he spent two years in Paris where he studied mediæval French, Latin and Greek at the Collège de France.39 As a result of this highly varied educational background he knew Albanian, Turkish, English, Italian, French, and German. In 1897, Konitza (under a pseudonym: Thrank Spirobeg) started issuing the periodical “Albania”, which existed until 1910. It was originally published both in Brussels and Paris. This magazine was one of the most important Albanian journals of that time—written both in Albanian and in French. It should be noted that the Austro-Hungarian foreign ministry largely sponsored “Albania”. After the five years he spent in Belgium, Konitza moved to London where he continued to publish his journal.40 He authored many articles in “Albania” about the country’s history, language and dialects, religions, and its nationalism. In autumn 1909, he decided to emigrate to the United States. Initially he came to Boston, where he worked as an editor for “Dielli”.41 He also edited other periodicals like addition, Noli’s translations of Orthodox liturgical books and hymnals into Albanian and then into English were among the first such works. 37 Robert Elsie, Albanian Literature: A Short History, (Lonon: I.

In August 1911, he enrolled in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University.43 Appointed by Ahmet Zogu, he served as Albania’s envoy to the United States from 1926 to 1939, when Mussolini invaded and then conquered Albania.44 Konitza died in Washington in 1942.45 Although he did not contribute any major works to Albanian literature, he is still described as a “stylist, critic, publicist and political figure” and one that “had a tremendous impact on Albanian writing and culture at the turn of the century”.46 Moreover, when he died, he left behind an unfinished manuscript about Albania that was posthumously edited and published by Qerim M. Panarity, the editor of “Dielli”.47 His other book, Albania: The Rock Garden of Southeastern Europe and other essays, was published in 1957. There is no doubt that these two Albanian leaders, Faik Konitza and Fan Noli, were the most influential figures living in United States during Albania’s formative years. It was chiefly due to their efforts that Albanian emigration was able to organize itself. Initially, Noli established an association called: Besa-Besën. However, soon thereafter he proposed a consolidation of the twelve different Albanian societies into a single pan-Albanian organization.48 His efforts gained the support of Konitza. On 24 December 1911, a first official meeting took place in Boston, which brought all the Albanian American organizations together into one federation. This meeting was called with the initiative of the Besa-Besën association. Among those present, except 42 Refat Xh Gurrazezi, “Historia e Federatës ‘Vatra,’” Voice of Albanians Zëri i Shqiptarëve, 10 August 2009, http://www.voalonline.ch/index.php?mod=article&cat=DIASPORAN%C3%8BZVIC%C3%8BRD HEBOT%C3%8B&article=2541 (accessed 19 June 2012). 43 Ibid.

The meetings continued until 28 April 1912, when a Pan-Albanian organization was officially founded. The official record of the unity commission says: We call as formed the Pan Albanian Federation of America by the following associations: Besa-Besën, Flamuri i Krujes-Kruja Flag, Shoqerise Kombetare-National Association and Dallandyshja. In this historic meeting a temporary board is named and its members are: Secretary Fr. Fan Noli Treasurer; Llambi Chikozi; Dielli Manager Kristo Kirka; Federation Branch Managers: Faik Konica and Kristo Floqi. Dielli Newspaper Supervisors: Paskal Aleksi, Elia Tromara and Kosta Vasili.49\n\nOn 28 April 1912, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America-Vatra (Federata Pan-Shqiptare “Vatra”, hearth) was therefore formed with the aim of assisting the national movement in Albania.50 The weekly newspaper “Dielli” was adopted as its official organ.51 Konitza became Secretary General of the Vatra Federation and from 1921–1926 he served as its president.52 Vatra became one of the most important forces calling for the creation of a democratic Albania and tried to influence the country’s politics. Konitza described the work of the Vatra in “Dielli” on 7 July 1922: During those dark days, when Albania was occupied by foreign armies, when the state was upside down and when the partition of Albania was in open talks—Vatra, being advised by a few patriots and inspired by its members’ love for the fatherland, encouraged by the voice of the Albanian people, took action and acted instead of the fallen state. It didn’t request any honorary reward, neither the rights of a state, but just undertook duties and expenses. Vatra spent money to finance the delegates, missions, agency subsidiaries, organizing thousands of protests, in a few words, the 49 “History of Vatra Federation,” Vatra Federation, http://vatrafederation.org/main/history (accessed 12 May 2012). 50 Spahiu, “Vatra of the Albanians.” 51 Owen Pearson, Albania And King Zog: Independence, Republic And Monarchy 1908-1939 (New York: Centre for Albanian Studies in association with IB Tauris Publishers in London, 2004), 24; Christo, “Chronology”; It was being published since 1909 by the Society of Besa-Besën in Boston by Fan Noli and Faik Konitza as a continuation of the “Kombi.” 52 Elsie, Historical Dictionary of Albania, 240. On behalf of the Vatra Federation, he took part in the Conference of Ambassadors where he defended Albanian interests–especially territorial interests. After his fight with Ismail Qemal, he decided to support the government of Essad Pasha Toptani.\n\n20\n\nChapter Two defence of Albania was organized through VATRA. It was so nicely organized that even the Greek PM Mr. Venizelos mentioned in the Paris Peace Conference that ‘…the only serious obstacle about Epirus was that of VATRA.’53\n\nAs Danny Blloshmi, a contemporary member of the Albanian émigré organisation, explains: “the idea was to say that we are all here in a foreign country but we are all home together”.54 Despite being an immigrant organization, Vatra sent its representatives to many different conferences or official meetings, for example to the Conference in London (1913),55 the Peace Conference in Europe after World War I, the Congress of the Oppressed Nations in Washington in 1918 and the Congress of Lushnjë. Before the end of World War I, Noli also had the opportunity of meeting President Wilson, to discuss Albanian interests.56 In 1920, the state government sent Noli, now residing in Albania, to Geneva as leader of the delegation that brought Albania’s admission to the League of Nations. His mission was crowned with success, as Albania was unanimously admitted to the League, which abrogated the Treaty of London for the partitioning of Albania by expansionist neighbouring countries and re-established its independence.57 However, Noli also continued to represent Albanian interests on behalf of Vatra. As its delegate he had already participated in the Congress of the Oppressed Nations in Washington just two years before his assignment to Geneva, marking a period of his crucial diplomatic activity. Furthermore,\n\n53\n\n“History of Vatra Federation,” Vatra Federation. Tanyanika Samuels, “Albanian organization commemorates 100 years,” New York Daily News, 4 May 2012, http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-05-04/news/ 31576939_1_albanian-students-albanian-immigrants-albanian-americans (accessed 18 May 2012). 55 Moreover, in 1913 Noli took part in an Albanian congress held in Trieste, where the issues of the freeing of Albania, the election of a monarch of Albania and the establishment of borders for an ethnic Albania with the support of Austro-Hungary and Italy were discussed, in Spahiu, “Vatra of the Albanians.” 56 Ibid., Haddad and Smith, 366. Fan Noli asked Wilson for the protection of Albania in the Conference of Paris and for permission to represent Albania in the Congress of the Oppressed Nations, held at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where President Wilson declared his famous “Fourteen Points.” Wilson told Noli that he had a say in the Peace Conference and promised him that he would use his influence in Albania’s favour, which he actually did. 57 Spahiu,“Vatra of the Albanians.” 54\n\nAlbania and Albanian Émigrés in the United States before World War II\n\n21\n\nVatra also sponsored Noli to attend the League of Nations in Geneva (1921) in the capacity of an Albanian diplomat. In 1921, the Albanian government asked the Pan-Albanian Federation Vatra to send a deputy to the Albanian parliament, as a sign of the acknowledgement or the sincere and patriotic activity and the Albanians in the United States. Vatra delegated Noli.58 In 1920 Vatra also sent its representatives to the Congress of Lushnjë where Albanian political leaders disputed the policies of the National Assembly introduced at the Peace Conference of Versailles, held in January 1920. At this conference the Albanian deputies decided to establish Tiranë as the capital of their country.59 Except for Albanian migration within the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey, the United States became the home to the largest section of the Albanian diaspora. By the late 1930s, the Albanian population in the United States was estimated to be in the range of 35,000 to 60,000, most of them Christian.60 Although the process of Albanian transatlantic migration started relatively late (in the second half of the nineteenth century), their adaptation progressed relatively quickly, especially in the Midwestern states where their interaction with other ethnic groups occurred more swiftly than in New York and Massachusetts. In 1935, a newspaper reported that the Albanians: …Were not a clannish people. [They] associate freely with other nationalities, do business with them, partake of their common culture, and 61 participate in a typically middle class way to the general life of the city.\n\nEven though Albanians were often confused with other ethnic groups, such as Greeks or Armenians, they managed to preserve a unique …Sense of communal identity, customs, and traditions in the numerous clubs, associations and coffee-houses that have been organized wherever Albanians live.62\n\nThere is no doubt that by 1939 Albanians living in the United States had progressed to better jobs, and had also improved their skills on different levels, for example in their rates of literacy. Perhaps half of them were 58\n\nChristo, “Chronology.” Pearson, Albania and King Zog, 138. 60 Haddad and Smith, 364. 61 Jurgens. 62 Ibid. 59\n\n22\n\nChapter Two\n\nworking in service and hospitality establishments, often self-employed in small family-run businesses. A very small number became lawyers, doctors, and other professionals.63 Through their ethnic organizations and the Albanian-American press, they were able to preserve their culture in exile. Furthermore, due to the activities of at least two unusual personalities—Fan S. Noli and Faik Konitza—the Albanian émigrés were able to create a uniform ethnic organization, recognized both in exile and in the home country, and were thus able to affect policies regarding Albania.\n\n63\n\nVullnetari, 16.\n\nCHAPTER THREE NAVIGATING THE DIVIDE: A MEMOIR OF POST-WAR EXILE AND DISPLACEMENT HARRIET NAPIERKOWSKI\n\nImagine a nine-year-old girl in the year 1910 in a small village of north central Poland, dressed in her Sunday best, preparing for her first trip to the city with her father. She sits excitedly in the horse-drawn wagon, not sure what to expect. Years later she describes the scene in her memoirs: It was my first trip to a city, and I was indeed very excited. We stopped at a bookstore called KsiĊgarnia Powszechna, and there I noticed a book, Bajarz Polski [Polish Fairy Tales], and I begged my father to buy it for me. I was thrilled when he did, and immediately on the way home in the wagon I started reading it.1\n\nThe little girl was Maria Lewandowska, and the trip to the city (Wáocáawek) was to be the first of many adventures in her life, chief among them her transatlantic migration to the United States, via a circuitous and often harrowing path. As Danuta Mostwin notes, Immigration means loss of familiar surroundings and often a loss of status. It also means separation […] from a familiar culture […] the learning of a\n\n1\n\nMaria Lewandowska, “A History of My Family,” (Unpublished memoir, Personal Archives), trans.

It means […] the struggle for survival and a test of one’s ability to meet challenge.2\n\nThis paper focuses on the memoirs of Maria Lewandowska, who provides a rich, detailed account of her exile and displacement experience. She wrote her memoirs after her husband’s death in 1961, continuing them until her own death in 1989, filling several thick spiral notebooks which, when translated into English, resulted in some 250 pages of typed text. In discussing the memoirs, I am primarily concerned with the values that sustained Lewandowska during a time of upheaval, and the source of her resilience during her exile and displacement. In addition, I also want to excavate the memoirs to determine how she and her children adapted to life in America, both in terms of language acquisition and cultural adaptation.\n\nFig. 3-1: Maria Lewandowska3\n\n2\n\nDanuta Mostwin, “Polish Immigrants in the United States,” Polish American Studies 26 (Autumn 1969): 5–6. 3 Photo of Maria Lewandowska ca. 1940, Author’s private collection.\n\nNavigating the Divide: A Memoir of Post-War Exile and Displacement\n\n25\n\nTo address these points and provide a context to Lewandowska’s exile experience and her response to it, some background information is warranted. Although Lewandowska had limited formal schooling, she was better educated than most in her socioeconomic class. Her passion for reading emerged early in life, as reflected in her description of the trip she took as a nine-year-old with her father; and as an adult she augmented her education through career training in home economics. She enjoyed the novels of Eliza Orzeszkowa and Bolesáaw Prus, was well read in serious Polish literature, and was familiar with the prevailing periodicals of the time, which published Polish poems, stories, and serialized novels. She spoke and wrote standard Polish, free of dialect, as is evident in her speech, her correspondence, and in the memoirs themselves, with an extensive vocabulary and few grammatical errors. All this meant that she considered her Polishness, linguistic and cultural, as essential to her identity. This, in turn, became a major factor in how she responded to her forthcoming years of exile, years that began with the onset of World War II. Before the Second World War, Lewandowska’s life was essentially stable. She lived in the Kujawy–Pomorskie region of north central Poland, and she writes poetically of her love for the village of Zakrzewo: My memories of those childhood years in Zakrzewo are still perfectly vivid, even after all these years. It was there that I grew up, knew every neighbour, every street, path, and shrub—every corner in our home. This was the place of my childhood, my youth, my family home.4\n\nIn 1930, after a somewhat turbulent courtship, which she describes in vivid detail, she married Stanisáaw Lewandowski: both were from rural backgrounds, and with a growing family they began working to establish their livelihood. Prior to their marriage Stanisáaw had qualified in dairy production, and in addition to owning some land, was now running a small dairy business in the region, his wife taking the goods to sell at market at ToruĔ, 27 kilometres away. To arrive at the market by early morning meant starting the journey by horse and wagon as early as three-thirty a.m., so in 1938 Stanisáaw, concerned about the toll that these trips were taking on his wife (who was now pregnant with her fourth child), accepted the position of running a dairy in Kozáowszczyzna, a town in the far reaches of eastern Poland, several hundred kilometres from Zakrzewo. This move to Kozáowszczyzna was a critical point in Lewandowska’s life, perhaps her first significant “migration” from what she considered her home. Despite the arduous trips to ToruĔ, especially during inclement 4\n\nLewandowska, “A History of My Family,” 3.\n\n26\n\nChapter Three\n\nweather, Lewandowska was reluctant to leave. Yet she knew that the move was necessary. She laments, Tearfully, I said goodbye to our home. So much of our hard work had been invested in our house, our garden, our land. …I disliked moving and leaving things I was attached to. I wondered whether we would like the new people and how we would adjust. As we were leaving, I kissed the door of our home, wondering when and if we would ever be here again.5\n\nAt that time Lewandowska could not have known how much her life would, indeed, change. With the outbreak of World War II a year later, she and her family found themselves in what is now Belarus and what Timothy Snyder describes in his book Bloodlands as the epicentre of horrific civilian massacres by both the German and the Russian occupiers.6 Lewandowska describes the chaos, uncertainty, and fear at the onset of the war: The news of the German attack on Poland went through us like lightning. We were terrified. People who had money bought everything they could, like salt, naphtha, and soap. The problem was that the banks were closed, and no withdrawals were allowed. My God, I thought. Winter was coming and we had only a few záotys, no wood for heating, no food stored away— nothing.7\n\nThe situation became even worse two weeks later when the Russians attacked Poland from the east: On September 17, a Sunday when we finally had the long-awaited rain, we heard the news that the terrible thing we all dreaded had happened. The Russians invaded Poland from the east and were heading our way. Some people actually thought that they were coming to help Poland fight the Germans. What everyone soon learned was that Germany and Russia had made an agreement to divide Poland. Kozáowszczyzna where we now lived was east of the river Bug, with Bug to be the new border where Russia was to take over. What kind of life lay ahead of us, we wondered. It never crossed our minds how horrible things would become.8\n\n5\n\nIbid., 91. Timothy Snyder, Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin (New York, NY: Basic Books, 2010). 7 Lewandowska, “A History of My Family,” 96. 8 Ibid., 97. 6\n\nNavigating the Divide: A Memoir of Post-War Exile and Displacement\n\n27\n\nFor Lewandowska and her family, the winter of 1940 was particularly harrowing. Not only was there the deprivation caused by the war, but in addition the weather was unusually bitter and cold. Concerning this, she writes: It was the longest winter I remember. The snowfall broke all records, the snow so deep that people could catch a deer with their hands. Due to the severe cold, you could hear trees snapping in the woods, as if someone were cracking them in half. I baked what bread I could that year and dried it, just in case we should be deported to Siberia.9\n\nLewandowska was especially fearful of deportation to Siberia, referred to by the Russian occupiers as “resettlement”. Because her husband Stanisáaw had served in the Polish army in the war of 1920, when the Poles repelled the Bolsheviks from the gates of Warsaw, he and his family were particular targets for “resettlement”. But as the German front progressed eastward towards Kozáowszczyzna, the area underwent a shift from Russian to German control, with many families being sent instead to forced labour in Germany, and Lewandowska’s family was among them. Anna D. JaroszyĔska-Kirchmann reports that “In May 1945 nearly 1.9 million citizens of pre-war Poland were in Germany [...] Over 90 per cent had been slave labourers in the economy of the Third Reich”.10 Departing for Germany, Lewandowska writes, We packed our belongings, bedding, and what food we had, waiting for the approaching train full of Russian prisoners from Nowogródek… . Our priest came and blessed us with the sign of the cross. I wept, as did the children, and someone said not to cry because the Germans would disapprove. As we climbed into the box cars added to the train, I thought to myself, ‘We’re leaving Poland, but would we ever return? When?’ Those were my thoughts as we said goodbye to Poland.11\n\nThus after four years under Russian occupation, the family found itself exiled to an equally severe existence in a German forced labour camp in Lüdenscheid, Germany. Indeed, World War II was the defining experience for Lewandowska and her family. During her years in eastern Poland and then in a forced labour camp in Germany, she experienced the German and 9\n\nIbid., 101. Anna D. JaroszyĔska-Kirchmann, The Exile Mission: The Polish Political Diaspora and Polish Americans, 1939–1956 (Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 2004), 60. 11 Lewandowska, “A History of My Family,” 130. 10\n\nChapter Three\n\n28\n\nRussian occupations, the brutality and dangers of the war, as well as the partisan attacks and the desperation of the Jews. In the ten years between the outbreak of the war and her emigration to the States, the many changes and chaos affecting her required an extraordinary strength of character and resilience, with the family’s care and safety always paramount in her mind. In the labour camp, everyone age ten or over was required to work in the local factory, but Lewandowska reported her daughter Zosia’s age as nine, thus exempting her from factory work, but 11-year-old Marylka and 12-year-old Grzesiu were therefore not exempted. Regarding conditions in the labour camp, Lewandowska notes, We were constantly hungry, the children suffering the most because of this. Three-year-old Jasiu was too little to understand why he was always hungry, and he would sit rocking, back and forth, saying ‘Chce siĊ jeĞü, chleba nie chce daü!’ (‘I am so hungry, and [Mama] won’t give me any bread!’) It broke my heart to hear this, and yet I had nothing to give. Now when I think back to it all, it seems like a cruel dream. Yet it was our reality.12\n\nLewandowska prayed unceasingly that the family would stay intact, that all would survive the war. And somehow, with what she perceived as the grace of God, they did. But with the end of the war the family now faced another kind of displacement, this time in the form of various refugee camps, also known as Displaced Persons (DP) Camps, living an aimless, nomadic existence. Those four years after the war were a critical stage in Lewandowska’s migration experience. Caught in a limbo of uncertainty, from 1945 to 1949 Lewandowska had no choice but to rely on her Polish ethos to help protect the family’s well-being. Conditions in the camp continued to be difficult: We wanted so very much to live normal lives. So many years had been wasted by the war, and now there were more years of uncertainty. Life in the camp seemed futile, with no clear destination on the horizon. We were especially concerned for the children’s futures, and we wanted to leave the camps as quickly as possible. Yet to go back to Poland, which had been stripped of its freedom, was not what we wanted. But at that point emigration abroad was primarily available to young, healthy adults without families, so our family had little hope of leaving the camps. Thus the years passed, and, we, still filled with vitality and determination, kept thinking,\n\n12\n\nIbid., 134.\n\nNavigating the Divide: A Memoir of Post-War Exile and Displacement\n\n29\n\nwhen would we leave? What would it be like? Would we get a chance to start over, to make up for all the lost years?13\n\nWhat ultimately opened the door for Lewandowska’s family and thousands of other Polish refugees was the 1948 passage of the Displaced Persons Act under the Truman Administration. Shortly thereafter, the family was notified that a farmer in Minnesota, in need of agricultural workers, had stepped forward to sponsor them. However, the next hurdle was meeting the medical requirements for emigration: Nine-year-old Jasiu had just spent two months in a children’s sanatorium, and the rest of us were debilitated as well because of conditions during the war, so we were concerned that we would not pass the medical exams. Indeed, Stanislaw and I, along with Jasiu and Zosia, did fail the exams, and once again we were detained. We just had to wait—those were the orders.14\n\nFinally, after several more rounds of medical reviews, the family was approved, and on the afternoon of 1 October 1949, they boarded the U.S.S. General Muir, a World War II army transport ship, and were on their way to America. Relieved, Lewandowska comments, “Gratefully, we said our final farewell. We were overjoyed to be leaving the inhospitable German soil”.15 Describing her first sighting of New York City, Lewandowska states, On the tenth day, we approached the shores of America. As the fog lifted, we could see the skyscrapers of Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, and I said a silent prayer, grateful that our long journey was almost over.16\n\nUpon arrival, each person received three dollars from a Polish American organization, so the family embarked on their new lives in the U.S. with 27 dollars. Now, however, they faced still another roadblock: upon learning that the family had seven children, the Minnesota farmer who had sponsored them rescinded his invitation. At that point, Lewandowska’s elderly uncle who lived in Chicago was immediately contacted and stepped in as a sponsor. The baggage was hurriedly readdressed, and the family took a train to Chicago that same evening, Lewandowska’s uncle paying the fare. 13\n\nIbid., 140.

Our primary goal was to buy a house, but first we needed a down payment. Stanislaw found a job in a lumber company, making $48 a week. Grzesiu found work for $32 a week, and then Marylka for $28 a week. Zosia was still too young to get a job, and Stasiu, Jasiu, and Jadzia were enrolled in school. Our youngest, Roszek, was an infant, but I also worked doing housecleaning for the owner of a nearby bakery. By the end of February, we had saved $1,000, enough for a down payment for a modest house on Baltimore Avenue. We took out a bank loan, and on 16 March 1950, we moved into our very own home. And, as the Polish saying goes ‘Lepsze maáe, aby swoje’ (‘Better a small home, but at least one’s own’).17 Slowly we became accustomed to our new way of life. We were starting all over again, just as we did after our wedding, but now the children were there to help. Even 11-year-old Stasiu contributed, making a few dollars a week delivering newspapers.18\n\nIn all of this it is important to remember t"
