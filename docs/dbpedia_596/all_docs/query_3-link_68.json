        "text": "The inheritance of WW2\n\nThe Polish Navy was re-established between 1945 and 1948 under vigilant supervision of the Soviet Union, with what was available at the time: The destroyer Błyskawica, but also three submarines, four minesweepers and two minesweepers acquired in Britain plus nine minesweepers, twelve patrol craft and a training tall ship, all Polish, plus three ex-British BYMS type minesweepers. To that collection, the USSR added twelve Submarine chasers, two MTBS in lieu of war reparations from the Kriegsmarine. When assembled they were insufficient for the defence of over 500 km of coastline.\n\n1947 Naval Plan:\n\nIn 1947 a Naval Estimate was prepared for the construction of a 42,000 ton fleet (eighteen submarines, twenty-four MTBS, nine escorts, forty-four patrol craft, sixty-six minesweepers), over 20 years. This programme reflected adoption of the Soviet naval doctrine of that time, confining the navy to flanking large army progression inland, while making extensive use of minefields and reinforced by coastal artillery, while the remainder would prey on enemy communications with small combatant covered by naval aviation. The 1947 estimate exceeded what was possible from a war-shattered economy however.\n\nWW2 legacy ships\n\nORP Blyskawica, modernized 1949-50 and 1957-61, Polish flagship until the late 1960s\n\n-Destroyer Burza (Wicher class 1929), BU 1977\n\n-Destroyer Blyskawica (Grom class 1936), preserved 1976\n\n3 Wilk class subs (Rys, Wilk, Zbik) BU 1952-54\n\n-Sep (Orzel class 1938), stricken 1969\n\n4 Jakoslka class minesweepers, stricken 1970\n\n9 Transferred T371 boat, stricken 1959\n\n2 D3 class MTBs stricken 1959\n\n11 OD-200 sub chasers, stricken 1959\n\n6 misc. ships stricken 1957-1961\n\n6 former German MFP landing ships, stricken 1957-1963\n\n1 former Italian MS landing ship acq. 1950, BDD 4, ODD 4, stricken 1963\n\n11 LCT-5 acq. 1950, stricken 1957-60\n\n3 LCM-3 acq. 1950, stricken 1960s\n\n4 YMS type minesweepers purchased 1948, stricken 1955-57\n\n1950 Naval Plan:\n\nIt was substituted by a 1950-55 plan for the construction, still modest, of just five MTBS, five patrol craft, five minesweepers and five coastal minesweepers.\n\nThis plan was abandoned in 1950 by the Soviet officers in command, who saw the Polish Navy as a local detachment of the Soviet Baltic Fleet.\n\n1951 Naval Plan:\n\nIn 1951 the ‘Plan for Reinforcing Defences’ was authorized. It concerned alltogether the modernisation of the army, air force and AA defence, but the navy was confined to defending only the main base at Gdynia (used by the USSR, with permanently based ships) and limited service of suitable ships. As a temporary measure, a landing craft flotilla was formed which comprised former German and US boats, as the old destroyer Burza, duly modernised.\n\n1955 Naval Plan:\n\nThe necessity of replacing ageing naval craft was only acknowledged four years later in the ‘Military Development Plan for 1955-60’, which proposed increasing the navy to five destroyers, nine frigates, twelve submarines and ninety-six MTBs (all to be imported from the Soviet Union), in addition to sixty minesweepers and eight submarine chasers built locally.\n\nThis enforced rearmament programme however was forced upon a still flegding economy, provoking a sharp decline which will provoke an acute food shortage in 1952. Only the easing of tension at the Geneva conference of July 1955 and internally after the 1956 Poznan riots, made it possible to halt the program. The wihtdrawal of certain command posts and symbolically, the return of Polish Military Uniforms were authorized. The initial military expansion program was halted, and at this point, the Polish navy had already purchased two Skoriy class destroyers, six ‘MV’ type submarines, twenty-seven fast craft. In addition the construction locally under licence of twelve ‘T43’ type and seven ‘TR40’ type minesweepers were undergoing.\n\n1961 Naval Plan:\n\nThe Khrushchev regime forced Poland to adopt a new armament programme, approved in March 1961 and planned an extension over seven years, with a destroyer flotilla of three ships, a missile boat flotilla of seven boats, a submarine brigade of seven boats, an MTB brigate of nineteen, and a sub-chaser flotilla of eight boats, plus a minesweweepers flotilla of twenty-four, a riverine flotilla of seven boats, plus a landing brigade of twenty-eight ships. This was a lot to bear, but as a measure of appeasement it was also decided these ships would be built locally, the minesweepers, sub-chasers, MTBs, landing ships and auxiliaries, like in East Germany at the time. The desired force at least on paper was only achieved in the late 1960s, but numerous earlier vessels already needed a replacement.\n\nThe decline of Polish planned economy, burdened with excessive military expenditures and lack of modern technology led to social unrest in December 1970. The ailing economy caused delays in replacement and was made only worse by the attitude of the Polish ministry of defence, emphasised a stronger development for better integration into the Warsaw Pact strategic planning.\n\nTherefore the basic combat potential planned for the Polish Navy in 1961 was never reached, and at the end development of the decade as follows:\n\n-Single ‘Kotlin SAM’ guided missile destroyer\n\n-Four “Whiskey V’ class submarines\n\n-50 small surface combatants (MTBs, sub-chasers)\n\n-33 landing ships +24 imported, ex-USSR\n\n-An ageing, small naval aviation division.\n\nThus the Polish Navy, which had been the largest of the non-Soviet naval forces lost its position to East Germany in the early 1980s.\n\n1980 naval plan:\n\nThe 1980 program focused on locally-built small surface combatants: FACs, MCVs and assault craft all with imported Soviet armaments and sensors. However at that stage, its development, largely was plagued by strikes, notably at Gdansk and Gdinya. After the withdrawal of the 30 years old destroyer Warsawa in 1986, the Poles were unable to contribute to the Warsaw Pact joint Baltic squadron until the arrival of the “Kashin mod” missile destroyer lend by USSR in 1988. It was the first for this Navy. Construction of FAC/M only started with difficulties by 1988, in cooperation with East Germany, and only the landing craft program was pursued nore vigorously, even though only five Lublin class have been completed.\n\nORP Warsaw, flagship, Kotlin SAM II type.\n\nAdditional purchases from the Soviet Union proved a considerable strain on the economy, but included four “Tarantul class” corvettes FAC/M replacing the old OSA I boats. Noteworthy was the transfer of the submarine Orzel in 1986 (sole Kilo class), and the smaller and cheaper Foxtrot class followed, with the Wilk and Wicher.\n\nFollowing economic restraints brought about as a result of this program, the Polish economy once again showed sign of crisis. Hardship suffered by the people caused much social unrest in the summer of 1988, and the Communist Party, discouraged by Moscow’s unwillingness to compromise its new image by supporting an unpopular regime, decided to negotiate with leaders of the hitherto illegal opposition. This resulted in the peaceful removal of communist rule after elections in June 1989, and triggered a similar process in neighbouring countries.\n\nPoland was the first country to join the ‘Partnership for Peace’ programme, and the most eager to join NATO, making the best possible use of the time given by the temporary weakness of the Russian Empire. An estimate to create a balanced and independent naval force was drawn up, and provided for five submarines, twelve ASW escorts, eighteen FACs, twenty MCVS and a naval aviation of eighty aircraft. This programme was however still well beyond the capacity of the Polish economy, driving forcefully from the centralised system to the open market.\n\nThe Polish Navy in 1995 comprised on paper at least, three submarines, a single missile destroyer, a surface escort, thirteen TACM, nineteen sub-chasers, twenty-four mineweepers and the landing ships. However most of these ships were without practical military value eiher because of obsolescence or lack of modern weapon systems, not even talking about NATO standards total incompatibility. The only units pratical value came from the single Kilo class submarine, the four Tarantul class corvettes, the five landing ships, the sixteen MCVS.\n\nThe Coast Guard was separated from the navy in 1991. The fleet headquarters are at Gdynia, and bases were at Gdynia Oksywie, Hel, Swinoujscie and Kolobraeg. Naval aviation comprised by then the 34th Fighter Wing (at Gdynia Babie Doly) 38 MIG-21 fighters, 4 TS-11 Iskra training aircraft, two AN-2 transport planes and two Mi-2 ‘Hoplite’ helicopters, and the 7th Training Wing irowice with fifteeri TS-11, eight An-2 and two An-28 bombers, an Helicopter Squadron at Darlowo, with fourteen Mi-14 ‘Haze’ and Mi-2 ‘Hoplite’, the 18th Despatch and Rescue Squadron with four RW Anakonda, three W-3 Sokol, ten Mi-2 helicopters and two An-28.\n\nWarsawa ii, credits magnum-x.pl\n\nORP Kaszub, the only Polish coldwar Corvette class, limited to the lead ship.\n\nORP Wilk, a Project 641 (Foxtrot) in the 1990s\n\nORP Kaszub corvette in Gdynia\n\nORP Orzeł of the Whiskey class (cutaway)\n\nORP Grom, Orkan class Missile corvettes\n\nMissile Corvette ORP Metalowiec in Gdynia (Tarantul class)\n\nPilica class patrol crafts\n\nORP Poznan of the Lublin class LSTs\n\nList:\n\nGrom class destroyers (Skoryy class) 1957, stricken 1967\n\nWarsawa Kotlin SAM acq.1970, stricken 1986\n\nWarsawa Kotlin Mod acq.1988, discarded 2000s\n\nKaszub Corvette (Balcom 6) 1986\n\nMV class subs (1948-52), delivered 1954, stricken 1970\n\n4 Whiskey class subs (transferred 1962-69), stricken 1990\n\nOrzel (Kilo class) acquired 1986, extant\n\nWilk class (Foxtrot) acquired 1987-88, extant\n\nGdynia class landing ships (Polocny A) 1965-68, discarded 1990s\n\nLenino class landing ships (Polocny B) 1968-71, discarded 1990s\n\nLublin class LSTs (Balcom 11) 1989-92, extant.\n\nCommand ship Grunwald (Polocny C) 1972 (+27 exported)\n\nEichstaden class LCs (LCP(L) type 1962, stricken 1990s\n\nMarabut class LCs 1973 stricken 1987\n\n3 Deba class LCs (1987), extant\n\n‘P6’ type FAC(T) (1956) discarded 1970s-80s\n\nOSA I type FAC(M) 1963-69, discarded 1990s\n\nBlyskawiczny experimental FAC(T) 1958, discarded 1970s\n\nBitny class FAC(T) (NATO Wisla) 1962, discarded 1984\n\nProject 665 FAC(M) 1977, construction abandoned.\n\nTarantul class missile corvettes delivered 1983-89\n\nOrkan class FAC(M) (Balcom 10) 1990s\n\n-Sub-chaser Bitny 1952, experimental.\n\nKronstadt class sub chasers (delivered 1955-57), stricken 1969-72\n\nOksywie class large patrol craft (Op 201 type) 1957, stricken 1980\n\nGdansk Large Patrol Crafts (1959), discarded 1980s\n\nLPC/SC (1965-72) extant 1990s\n\nKaper class patrol craft (SKS 40 type) built 1991\n\nPilica class PC/SC 1971-74/1973-83, extant\n\nKP 100 class inland patrol boats (1953-54), stricken 1970s\n\nWiloska class coastal patrol craft (1970s), extant 1990s\n\nT43 licence bult minesweepers 1955-62, stricken 1987-93\n\nKrogulec class minesweepers 1962-67, stricken 1990s\n\nGRP hull Goplo class minesweepers 1981-85, extant\n\nMamry class (improved Goplo) 1990s\n\nLeniwka class experimental coastal mineswpeers 1984\n\n‘TR40’ type river minesweepers 1954-56, stricken 1969-70\n\n‘K8’ type minesweeping boats 1956-60, stricken 1986\n\nThe modern Polish Navy\n\nORP Ślązak, Gawron-class offshore patrol vessel (OPV). The program was cancelled and instead Babcock’s Arrowhead 140 frigates will be built.\n\nNote: The modern Polish Navy will be the object of a standalone article in the future.\n\nPoland’s entrance into NATO greatly changed the structure and role due to its integration, new standards, and gradual shift to western equipments and procedures. Most of Naval High Command focused on coastal defense and Baltic Sea Operation, with a mindset for integration within the international NATO operations. Modernization programs consisted in the acquisition of two Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates while the Naval air arm acquired several SH-2G Super Seasprite helicopters. The bulk of the navy remains its sole Kilo-class attack submarine ORP Orzeł.\n\nThe Polish Navy took part in many joint operations and by 1999 Gdynia hosted the while Baltic NATO submarine force, “Cooperative Poseidon” while a joint American-Polish submarine training (“Baltic Porpoise”) started.\n\nIn the 2020s modernization is going strong, with an initial 2010 9 billion zloty program, reduced in 2012 to 5 billion, causing delays and cancellations. The 2017 strategy called for 13 billion zloty and 22 new warships, plus larger warships unsuitable for the Baltic Sea while expanding the life of one of OHP-class frigate.\n\n12 new ships are to be commissioned before 2026. The plan was updated in 2017 for 22 new vessels:\n\n-Three coast-defense vessels (Miecznik class, 2600 tons)\n\n-Three patrol/mine countermeasure vessels (Czapla class, 1700 tons)\n\n-Six tugboats, two tankers, two rescue ships, one ELINT, one logistical support ship, one joint support ship.\n\nOn 2 July 2015, ORP Ślązak was launched, the first new Polish-built Navy ship in 21 years.\n\nIn 2022, Babcock announced selection of its Arrowhead 140 design for the Miecznik program of large multi-mission frigates.\n\nAs for coastal force, Poland acquired no less than 36 Swedish RBS15 Mk3 and 50 (50/74) Norwegian Naval Strike Missiles.\n\nThe Navy’s helicopter fleet planned in 2017 up to eight ASW/SAR units.\n\nThe Gawron-class corvettes program was cancelled and unique ship converted as a patrol vessel.\n\nIn 2013 the Coastal Missile Division had 12 Naval Strike Missiles, two TRS-15C radars.\n\nJust as a quick taste, as of 2023, the Polish Navy underwent the same massive ramping up as other forces (Air Force and Army), albeit more moderate, as immediate bellicose neighbours:\n\n48 ships, including: 3 submarines, 2 frigates, 2 corvettes, 3 fast-attack craft, 21 mine destroyers, 5 mine layers, 4 salvage ships, 6 auxiliary ships and 2 training vessels. For the naval air branch, 40 naval aircraft (10 maritime patrol planes, 4 transport planes, 10 search air-rescue helicopters, 12 anti-submarine warfare helicopters, 4 transport & training helicopters).\n\nPolish Destroyers\n\nLegacy destroyers: Burza, Blyskawica\n\nBurza as museum ship in Gdynia, in the 1960s\n\nBlyskawica as a museum ship today\n\nORP Burza:\n\nThe former Wicher class came back in Poland after WW2 in 1951, towed to Gdynia in July. She was overhauled and re-entered service in 1955 wittout significant modernization andn thus, ended in 1960 as a museum ship and eventually scrapped in 1977.\n\nORP Blyskawica:\n\nAfter herreturn to Poland she served as training ship, cruised with officer cadets and visited Leningrad. She had a frst update in 1951-52 with her 4-in replaced by Soviet B-34 100 mm gun barrels in the same mountings and Soviet 37 mm AA guns (four twin, two single mountings) plus Soviet triple 533.4 mm torpedo tube mount and radar, a copy of British type 291 radar set. In September 1955 with ORP Burza she visited Portsmouth. July 1957 she visited Stockholm. Her second modernization in 1957–1960 modernized her propulsion, radio and electronic equipment plus new radar and upgraded B-34 U 100mm guns.\n\nShe visited Helsinki in 1961, Greenwich in 1962, Copenhagen in 1963, Chatham, in 1964, Narvik, in 1965. On August 9, 1967 she had a high-pressure steam pipe rupturing (seven sailors killed). It was decided not to repair her and instead she became a static AA defense ship in Świnoujście from June 1969. By May 1976 she became a museum ship in Gdynia, still her with us today.\n\nGrom class destroyers (1957-67)\n\nORP Wicher of the Skoryy type\n\nTwo Skory class destroyers, transferred from the Baltic Fleet. No notable event or modernization. Pennants were changed to 273-274 in 1960 and they were discarded in 1975.\n\nc (i) KOTLIN SAM (1970-1986)\n\nORP Warszawa was a Kotlin-class destroyer from Leningrad, originally Spravedlivy. She was transferred to the Polish Navy in 1970 and served until 1986 when decommissioned. No change, she was “stock”. See the full Kotlin class article\n\nORP Warsawa (ii) KOTLIN M (1988-2016)\n\nORP Warsaw (iii) of the Kashin Mod class in 2004\n\nBuild at 61 Communards Shipyard and laid down on 15 November 1966 as Smelyi, Launched on 6 February 1968, Commissioned on 27 December 1969, as part of the CKB-53 class (NATO Kashin-class) and among the largest destroyers at 4,950 tonnes she was used as a multi-purpose vessel with an almost full auto armament. Modernized 1972-1974 to the 61MP standard (NATO Kashin mod) between armament, radar and fire control systems. By 1987 she was leased by Poland as replacement for the previous worn out Warszawa. In 1992-1993 she was permanently transferred in exchange for Soviet debts in Gdynia.\n\n16 years later she was discarded and sold back to USSR and sent to the reserve, sold again for scrap at Gdańsk.\n\nPolish Missile ships\n\nORP Kaszub (Balcom 6, Project 620) (1986)\n\n2-views Profile by Grzegorz Nowak, dedicated book on the Kaszub\n\nWork on the first Polish Frigate started in 1971 but only resulted in a construction from 1984, laid down at Stocznia Północna in Gdańsk on 9 June, launched on 11 May 1986, and after modifications, was commissioned on 15 March 1987, and not fitted with her intended armament, the 9K33 Osa (NATO SA-N-4 Gecko) SAM as unreliable on small platforms. Her main gun armament was also removed to preserve stability. The initial plan was for 7 ships but the end of the cold war saw her as being unique. She saw little operational and was in the end loaned to the Polish Border guard from 1990. By September 1991 she at last receiced a AK-176 76 mm (3.0 in) gun turret forward and by October 2016 a single Oerlikon 35 mm gun AM-35 Tryton system was mounted.\n\nShe diplaced 1,051 long tons standard/1,183 long tons (1,202 t) full load for 82.34 x 10 x 4.9 m (270 ft 2 in x 10 ft 2 in x 16 ft 1 in). She was powered by four Cegieski-Sulzer AS 16V 25/30 diesels in a CODAD arrangement on two shafts for a total output of 12.42 MW (16,660 shp), top speed 27 kn (31 mph; 50 km/h), Range 3,500 mi (3,000 nmi; 5,600 km) at 14 kn (16 mph; 26 km/h), a crew of 67.
