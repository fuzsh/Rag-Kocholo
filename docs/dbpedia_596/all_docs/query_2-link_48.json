        "text": "Over 35,000,000 soldiers, sailors and aviators were taken prisoner during the Second World War. Some 35,000 of these prisoners were members of the German army, navy and air force, imprisoned in twenty-five main compounds and 300 small, isolated labour camps across Canada. Once on Canadian soil, German POWs were treated with remarkable hospitality in spite of their status as the “Nazi” enemy. Canada’s excellent treatment of German POWs was a product of many things: a desire to adhere to the Geneva Convention; concern for the well-being of Canadian and other Allied POWs in German hands; and the discovery that German POWs often made valuable workers, for which there was a great need during the war. It was also a product of racism, expressed in numerous actions, suggesting a willingness to perceive German POWs as potential members of society a willingness not extended to German-Jewish civilian internees or even to Japanese-Canadians who were already Canadian citizens. Lay Summary During...\n\nIn August 1943, Le Regiment de Hull, a French-speaking infantry battalion, part of Greenlight Force, a Canadian Army brigade, landed on the Aleutian Island of Kiska in tandem with a larger American Army force. LRH was unique, being the only Francophone Home Defence unit sent into combat by Canada during the Second World War. This paper explains how LRH was chosen, outlines the many problems it faced and overcame in the training process, and details how the Canadian Army played down or hid the linguistically-based bigotry faced by LRH from both Canadian and American units at Kiska. O n 31 Decem ber 1943, Major E.T. Jacques, Le Regiment de Hull’s (lrh) acting commander, assessed lrh ’s part in Greenlight Force, the Canadian army brigade group that landed on Kiska Island that August. Certain that this “priceless experience ... will surely serve us in good stead when, might it be next month or next year that we are called upon again to do our bit in a new theatre of operation,” Jacques ...\n\nIn 2014, the first remains of a former prisoner-of-war (PoW) camp in Czersk, Poland, were discovered. These were largely relics of barracks, dug-outs and trash pits. They were recorded thanks to Open Access Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derivatives in the form of hillshade models. Since that time, this unique heritage has become the object of closer, non-invasive archaeological research. This chapter discusses and summarizes various archaeological and social initiatives regarding the Czersk camp that have been taking place since the discovery.\n\nMany sites related to the First World War are forgotten and neglected in today’s Poland. This paper shortly presents the ways of practicing conflict archaeology in Poland and it discusses results of the non-invasive archaeological survey conducted in Tuchola and Czersk, places where during the First World War Germans built and run prisoners of war camps. In the article the material remains of the camps that have survived in the local landscapes till the present are analyzed. Both sites are at the same time remembered and forgotten by local communities. This paper tries to account for oblivion as an inherent part of local landscapes that adds a unique value to them."
