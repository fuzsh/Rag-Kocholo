        "text": "Relevance to Tarnów: Karol Wojtyła often visited Tarnów during his service as a Bishop and Metropolitan of Cracow. Pope John Paul II stayed in Tarnów on 9th and 10th of June, 1987. At that time, during his meeting with the citizens of Tarnów he said: “You do not realize how I have always enjoyed my visits to Tarnów”. It is one of the first statues of pope John Paul II in Poland! It is situated on pl. Katedralny, next to the southern wall of the Cathedral chancel. Bronze statue presents Pope in a canonical dress with wide open arms. The monument consists of two parts: three expressive kneeling figures constitute first part of the monument, second part is a concrete architectural structure with two “Grunwald” swords rising over it as well as a crying child by the wall (a symbol of life after the loss of the intimates). On the site facing Narutowicza street the two dates are engraved: 1939-1945, whereas the back wall was engraved with the following words: “In honor of 45 000 inhabitants of Tarnów region – the slaughtered victims of German fascism, the heroes who died for the independence of our homeland in the years 1939-1945”. The first monument of unknown soldier was actually a plaque with an inscription: “To the Unknown Polish Soldier who sacrificed his life for the freedom of our homeland 1914-1920”. Anonymous author left the plaque by Adam Mickiewicz’s monument on plac Kazimierza Wielkiego on the night of 20 June, 1925. Erection of the monument in its present form was inspired by Tarnów branch of Towarzystwo Opieki nad Grobami Bohaterów in 1931. It is designed as a tumulus, made of porphyry and scattered rocks. It is crowned with a polyhedron modernistic pedestal with an iron light symbolizing an oil lamp (a few months after the unveiling urn with a soil from Cmentarz Legionistów in Łowczówek – the Polish Legions Cemetery – was placed inside). Relevance to Tarnów: Józef Szujski was born on 16th of June 1835 in Tarnów and died on 7th of February 1883 in Cracow. He was one of the greatest Polish historians of his times, professor of the Jagiellonian University in Cracow and a co-founder of Przegląd Polski, monthly magazine dedicated to science and literature. He was also a member of a political group “Stańczyki”. The idea of erecting this statue was also Bronisław Trzaskowski’s, headmaster of High School Number 1 in Tarnów. It is a bronze bust placed on a tall stone pedestal. Relevance to Tarnów: In September 1945, in a newly created Municipal Home of Culture (cultural center located in a building which earlier served as a seat of “Sokół” – Polish Gymnastic Society) the Old Theater was established, renamed to Ludwik Solski Municipal Theater on 28th of October of the same year. Solski – one of the greatest Polish actors, still performing at the time the Theater was created, not only agreed to use his name but also directed and performed on stage in Tarnów. The bronze bust figure presents Solski in one of his roles. It is a gift from the actor to his theater. It is the first monument of that kind in Poland. Its corner stone was sacred by Pope John Paul II 16th June 1999 during a mass in Stary Sącz. The figure of woman symbolizes Poland from which three eagles fly away. The figure of woman was cast in bronze and the rocks are of red granite.\n\nNext to the monument an obelisk was placed with an inscription on the plaque:\n\n“In honor of the victims of stalinism in the years 1939-1956”. Tragic life of the victims is expressed in the form of an injured bird connected to the other birds by the V sign. This 6 meters high sculpture was cast in bronze and mounted atop granite pedestal (in the form of two cracked plates symbolizing tear of Poland after the outbreak of WWII. Stone elements are enriched with bronze bas-reliefs presenting the symbols of: the Kotwica or Polska Walcząca (Fighting Poland – a World War II emblem of the Polish Underground State and AK (Armia Krajowa – Home Army), Sybiracy Association, Katyń Massacre, Political Prisoners of Stalinism Association and dates of the phases of rebuilding new homeland. The stone plate was placed in front of the monument which allows people to put flowers. The idea of the monument was initiated by Social Committee for Building a Monument to Victims of Stalinism in Tarnów and is a tribute of the whole society of Małopolska region to the victims of stalinism and repressions in years 1939-1956. The monument is devoted to the following: Poles slaughtered in Katyń, Charków, Twer and other places of execution in the Soviet Union; Home Army soldiers slaughtered or repressed by NKVD; members of anti-communist Polish resistance movements sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment by Polish People’s Republic courts. Relevance to Tarnów: General Józef Bem, National Hero of Poland and Hungary, was born in Tarnów on March 14, 1794 and died in Aleppo (Syria) on December 10, 1850. His ashes were ceremonially brought back to Poland in 1929 and laid in a grand Mausoleum in Strzelecki Park. As a result of his conversion to Islam (consequently, he changed his name for Murad Pasza), Bem could not be buried in the Tarnów Cathedral. The monument was initiated by Tarnów Friends of Hungary Association and erected in 1985. It presents a standing general wearing Hungarian uniform. His figure was cast in bronze in the Tarnów casting works of Roman Sapa and was mounted atop a granite pedestal. Other Bem’s monuments can be found in Ostrołęka, Poland and Budapest, Hungary. Bemowo – one of the districts of Warsaw was named after General.\n\nRelevance to Tarnów: General Józef Bem, the hero of Poland and Hungary, was born in Tarnów 14th March 1794 and died in Aleppo(Syria) 10th December 1850. The ashes of the general were ceremonially brought to Poland in 1929 and buried in a magnificent mausoleum in Park Strzelecki. As a result of the change of denomination(consequently he changed his name for Murad Pasza) could not be buried in the Tarnów Cathedral. In Park Strzelecki in the middle of a park pond there was erected a mausoleum-sarcophagus resting on six Corinthian columns.\n\nIts walls are inscribed with:\n\n– dates: 1794 (year of birth), 1850 (his death), 1929 (his ashes were brought to Tarnów)\n\n– inscriptions: in Polish “Józef Bem”, in Hungarian “Daddy Bem”, the greatest leader of the Hungarian independence movement”, in Arab “Ferik Murad Pasza”. The pillars of the mausoleum were placed on a two-stage plate which rises from water and were surrounded with stone balls symbolizing artillery in which general Bem served. These balls are linked by the gun metal chains cast from melt cannons.\n\nThe elements of the monument: a plate with four plaques, two high pillars embellished with some elements containing the quotes of B. Jastrun: “To co się stanie z kodeksem dziejów…Wyście pisali krwią i nadzieją”. After the victory of the “Solidarity”an iron cross(resembling that of Pope) was added. On the monument there are engraved 23 names of the fallen of whom the youngest was 12 years old and the eldest was 47. One of the inscriptions says: “They were killed struggling against Nazi occupiers in years 1939-1945. Honour to their remembrance” Relevance to Tarnów: Jan Szczepanik, “Polish Edison”, was born on 13th June 1872 in Rudniki near Mościska(Ukraine) and died 8th November 1926 in Tarnów. He was connected with Tarnów since 1902 when he married Wanda Dzikowska (born in 1879) in the Tarnów cathedral, she was a daughter of a famous Tarnów district doctor – Zygmunt Dzikowski. Szczepanik was connected with Vienna and Drezno by his occupation but he always returned to his family in Tarnów. After death he was buried in a grave of Dzikowscy family at the Old Cemetery in Tarnów. It is the first in the world monument of a gifted inventor-the pioneer of a colour photography, television and film,the precursor of a modern weaving industry and a bulletproof vest. Relevance to Tarnów: In years 1947-1993 in the so called “lower barracks” in Tarnów there were stationed the 14th Kołobrzeg Mechanised Regiment.\n\nThe soldiers took part in the fights for Warszawa, Kołobrzeg as well as in the bloody fights for the breaking of Wał Pomorski where a heavy toll was taken as a result of a severely fortified area. During the ceremony of the unveiling of the monument an urn containing earth coming from battle fields(where 355 soldiers died) was placed. On the granite socle there is a large white Piast eagle and at the foot of the monument an inscription: “in this place there is buried an earth with blood of the fallen soldiers of the 14th Infantry Regiment from the battle fields of WWII” was engraved. Relevance to Tarnów: Rufin Piotrowski: an insurgent, a diarist and a teacher in schools of Tarnów, died in 1872 in Tarnów The monument is composed of stone blocks in the form of a steep pyramid on which a figure of a woman was placed (she symbolizes our homeland). In one hand she holds a medallion presenting the head of a man, in the other she keeps a laurel wreath. On the monument there is also placed a chain with broken shackles. Relevance to Tarnów: Székely Gate named after Józef Bem and Sandor Petöfi is a gift of a Hungarian foundation Irott Szó and Sepsiszentgyőrgy city for Tarnów city. It is the second, except for Stary Sącz, such gate in Poland. The day of the passing of the gate was connected with the 170th anniversary of the battle of Ostrołęka – one of the battles of the Polish November uprising in which Józef Bem participated.\n\nThe word “Székely” (Siculi) means folk, nation and the mission of the defense of south-eastern borders of the Hungarian Kingdom. The Székely reside in the area located the farthest in the east in the Carpathian Mountains. They have played an important role in the Hungarian history and intellectual life. The medieval Székely self-government and military democracy was a one-of-a-kind phenomenon in feudal Europe.\n\nTill the 14th century the notion of Székely-siculitas-was tantamount to the notion of nobility. Modern history has been the sequence of various battles for rights. Székely gates constitute the embodiment of a peculiar folk awareness. They were made of different kinds of good quality oak trees and less frequently of pine trees. The structure of the gates resemble European craftsmanship technique whereas the layout of the ornaments (sculpted plants, mustaches and other symbols) symbolizes another world and have its source in the reality before the conquest of Hungarians who came from east.\n\nAmong the gates built ages before on the large areas of eastern Europe the most numerous and technically interesting ones are preserved in Transylvania. Unfortunately they are completely forgotten in Europe. The traditional Székely hospitality does not allow gates to be closed. They are open to everybody, both happy and miserable, like open and philanthropic hearts of the Székely. It is expressed by the inscriptions on the arches of the gates: “Peace to the newcomers, blessing with the leavers”.\n\n“Kopijnik” is a gift donated to Tarnów by Hungarian cities.\n\n“Kopijnik” is the Polish equivalent of the Hungarian word “Kopjafa”, meaning a wooden pole traditionally placed on the tombs of warriors in Hungary to honor their heroic deeds. A few similar poles were placed in other Polish cities.
