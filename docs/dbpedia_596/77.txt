Biography

He was a comprehensively educated and talented pre-war officer and nurturer of many officers school age groups. Apart from military education he was a qualified pedagogue as well. He graduated teachers seminary in Sokal in 1913. He then began to study law at Jan Kazimierz university in Lwow. In 1914, he graduated with merit from an austrian officers school in Belzinek (austr: Bering). After Poland regained its independence, he joined the Polish army and served continuously until the outbreak of WWII. In 1920, he took part in the Polish-Soviet war. In 1928, he became the chief of Reserve Infrantry Officer Cadet School in Tomaszow Mazowiecki. He was promoted to colonel in 1932. Before the outbreak of WWII, he was in command of 52th Infrantry Regiment in Zloczow. He was suprisingly promoted to commander of Land Coastal Defence on the 23rd of July 1939.

The High Command executive order from the 30th of July 1939 stated: Defend Gdynia and Oksywie Heights (Kępa Oksywska) in order not to let the enemy to take control of these areas. Enable mobilisation of polish fleet. Relocate military equipment from Gdynia to Hel Peninsula. Make it impossible for the enemy to set up long range artillery in Oksywie Flats area."

With the nightfall on the 1st of September, subordinates of col. Dąbek began to fight starting from the counter-attack which pushed the Germans back to Gdansk.

On 19th of September of 1939, facing inevitable defeat, with no hope for any supplies nor reinforcements from the Hel Peninsula, running out of ammunition, and with remaining soldiers hardly able to continue fight, col. Stanislaw Dąbek (whom was wounded from mortar fire) called in lieutenant col. Szpunar, and ordered him to ceasefire in the event of his death. Then he stepped few meters on the side and committed suicide.

In recognition of col. Dąbeks military skills and bravery, Germans allowed him to be buried with full military honours, not far from the place he died. Four delegated German officers took part in the funeral.

On the 30th of October 1946 col. Stanislaw Dabek was re-buried in The Coast Defenders Cementary in Gdynia Redlowo (Cmentarz Obrońców Wybrzeża). He became one of the most iconic people of Gdynia, despite the fact that his presence in the city lasted only 59 days. He was posthumously promoted to rank of brigadier general.
