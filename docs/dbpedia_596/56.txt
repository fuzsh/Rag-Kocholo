The Poles were successful in blunting the German blitzkrieg, removing the opportunity for the Germans to use their ‘lighting war’ tactic successfully and pierce the Polish defences. Instead, both sides now got bogged down in close quarter fighting – described as similar to the trench warfare of the First World War - which resulted in a slower German advance but a high casualty rate amongst the Poles, unsurprising given that the Germans had double the number of Polish troops, numbering around 38,000 men.

Seeing that there was no likelihood or reinforcements arriving, the Poles withdrew to the densely forested heights at Oksywie Heights which lay northeast of Gdynia. Although there were no fortifications prepared here, the terrain afforded itself well to defence and the thick trees made enemy observation from the air that much harder. The Poles realised they may fare better here than in the city itself.

Although the Polish forces managed to halt the German blitzkrieg and the fighting resembled World War I on the western front, the besieged garrison was suffering heavy losses and desperately needed to shorten its front lines. As there was no chance of relief of the besieged Polish forces by a strong force from the Polish mainland, the Heights offered a decent defensive position. Although completely unprepared for defence, the area was densely forested and made enemy penetration and aerial and naval bombardment much more difficult.
