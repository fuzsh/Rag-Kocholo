Ships of the Standing NATO Maritime Group One (SNMG1) will enter the port of Gdynia on Friday, 26 May, between 7:00 and 10:00. The team will probably leave the port of Gdynia on 30 May.

Entering Gdynia from 7 a.m. at half-hourly intervals will be: FGS Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (French Quay berth), NRP Bartolomeu Dias (French Quay), HNLMS Van Amstel (United States Quay), ORP Gen. T. Kościuszko (Port Wojenny Gdynia) and ESPS Alvaro De Bazan (Port Wojenny Gdynia).

The visit of the Allied Team is of a working nature. The ships will not be made available for sightseeing.

The NATO Standing Ship Team was established in January 1968 as STANAVFORLANT (Standing Naval Force Atlantic). In 2003, its name was changed to Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 (SNMG-1) and it was placed under NATO’s Joint Naval Force Atlantic Command. SNMG-1 is part of the NATO Response Force.

SNMG-1 is one of the two standing ship teams of the North Atlantic Alliance, comprising selected destroyers and frigates of member states. The backbone of the team is made up of vessels from the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands, which are periodically joined by ships from Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, Spain and Poland.

The multinational elite team is maintained at the highest level of combat readiness and is designed for immediate response in crisis situations, peacekeeping operations and in the event of war. The ships operate in the Atlantic and all European waters and are the best-trained international strike team of its kind in the world. In fulfilling their tasks at sea, the ships are capable of monitoring shipping, controlling suspicious craft, conducting blockade actions and evacuating threatened populations, and can also serve as bases for naval infantry and special units performing inland tasks.
