        "text": "You don't mess with perfection.\n\nThe way non-American TV and film productions tend to not get the same attention as American ones is so frustrating, especially when they're REALLY good.\n\nSure, we're all familiar with the Academy Award-winning Mexican film Roma or the hit Canadian show Kim's Convenience, so it's not that Americans don't care for foreign productions.\n\nBut let's be honest, the remakes are hardly ever as good as the original. So I want to know from you: what are some American remakes that just didn't need to happen?\n\nMaybe you're like me and did a double-take when you found out a remake of the French film The Intouchables was coming out with Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston.\n\nOr maybe you enjoyed all seven seasons of the original Skins but couldn't get through the American version on MTV, which only lasted for one season.\n\nOr maybe you like horror films but feel like The Ring just didn't live up to its Japanese predecessor, Ring.\n\nWe want to know which American remakes of movies and shows didn't live up to the originals and why they didn't make the cut. Let us know in the comments section below!\n\nThe best responses will be featured in an upcoming BuzzFeed Community post!\n\nShare This Article"
