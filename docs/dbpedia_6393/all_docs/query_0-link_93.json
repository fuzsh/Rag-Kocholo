        "text": "Gene Hackman retired from acting in 2004, leaving behind a rich filmography filled with Oscar-winning classics, popcorn entertainments, and even a few duds here and there. An A-list star for nearly four decades, Hackman was capable of both carrying a film as the lead and enlivening it with a memorable supporting turn. No matter how big or small the role was, you knew you were in for a treat whenever Hackman was onscreen.\n\nBorn in 1930 in San Bernardino, California, Hackman struggled early on in bit roles in film and television before hitting it big with the groundbreaking New Hollywood classic \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967). Hackman was part of a new generation of actors (along with his former roommates Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall) who thrived throughout the late 1960s-1970s, when more realistic-looking leading men replaced the conventionally handsome ones. This, combined with an emphasis on a more naturalistic style of acting and a grittier form of filmmaking overall, cleared a path for a whole new type of movie star to thrive.\n\nYet Hackman didn't flourish for just one decade; rather, his flower remained in bloom right up until the time he decided to call it quits. Throughout his career, Hackman won two Oscars (best actor for \"The French Connection\" and best supporting actor for \"Unforgiven\") and competed three additional times (best actor for \"Mississippi Burning\" and best supporting actor for \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and \"I Never Sang for My Father\"). He also won two BAFTAs, three Golden Globes, and one SAG Ensemble prize.\n\nLet's take a look back at all of Hackman's many films, ranked from worst to best.\n\nHackman made his big-screen debut in \"Lilith,\" and if nothing else, you have to thank this film for introducing him to Warren Beatty, who would later cast him as his brother in \"Bonnie and Clyde.\" Produced during the psychoanalysis boom of the 1960s, it's the story of a war veteran turned therapist (Beatty) who finds work in a sanitarium and falls in love with one of his patients: the beautiful, unstable Lilith (Jean Seberg). Things get complicated when another patient (Peter Fonda) falls in love with her as well. Hackman has a small role as Norman, who's having marital problems with his wife (Jessica Walter). Even with his limited screen time, it's no wonder he became a major star just three years later.\n\nFor fans of David Mamet, \"Heist\" is cinematic heaven, a crackerjack crime thriller with the kind of streetsmart dialogue and twisty narrative that have made the writer-director famous. It's also a performance showcase for its A-list cast, led by Hackman as a professional jewel thief who has to retire after his face is caught on security camera footage during a robbery. His plans to sail off into the sunset with his young wife (Rebecca Pidgeon) don't sit well with his handler (Danny DeVito), who pulls him back in for another job and insists he add his nephew (Sam Rockwell) to his crew (which also includes Delroy Lindo and Ricky Jay). Read no more if you haven't seen the film, which is filled with surprises.\n\nDespite a troubled production that saw the replacement of director Richard Donner with Richard Lester (the 2006 \"Richard Donner Cut\" was the Snyder Cut of its day), \"Superman II\" is a worthy successor to the 1978 franchise starter. Christopher Reeve dons the cape yet again to play the Man of Steel, who has forsaken his powers to start a relationship with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Unfortunately, a nuclear bomb he hurled into space inadvertently released the evil General Zod (Terence Stamp) and his Kryptonian henchmen from prison, and they're on their way to Earth. Hackman returns as Lex Luthor, who has also escaped from prison and is giving his arch-nemesis a tough time in his retirement. (Well, sort of returns, since Hackman refused to complete filming when Donner was fired out of loyalty to the director; his remaining scenes were shot with a stand-in and voice doubles.)\n\nThe New Hollywood of the late 1960s-'70s was so richly creative that even films that were dismissed as minor in their time have been rediscovered as classics. Such is the case with Jerry Schatzberg's \"Scarecrow,\" which was a modest critical success when it was released in 1973 and has only grown in stature since then. It's a gritty little drama about a pair of drifters — ex-con Max (Hackman) and homeless sailor Lion (Al Pacino) — who hit the road from California to Pittsburgh in the hopes of starting a business. While on the way, they stop off in Detroit so Lion can finally meet the child he left behind. There's not much in the way of plot, but you don't really need it to enjoy watching two titans of acting play off each other as Hackman and Pacino do here.\n\nAlthough the 1970s are remembered as a golden age for artistically daring films, it was also a great period for high-quality junk, typified by the disaster movies that earned hefty box office receipts throughout the decade. \"The Poseidon Adventure\" is one of the very best in the genre of films that placed an all-star cast in a perilous situation, be it an airplane crash (\"Airport\"), a raging building fire (\"The Towering Inferno\"), or an earthquake (er, \"Earthquake\"). This time it's a luxury ocean liner that flips upside down, causing nine passengers to race to the bottom in order to get out on top. Hackman stars as their leader, a fiery reverend who inspires them to persevere. The premise may be absurd, but that didn't stop critics (and even Oscar voters, who awarded it two wins and seven nominations) from lapping this up.\n\nIn remaking the French farce \"La Cage aux Folles\" for American audiences, director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Elaine May avoided turning their outlandish characters into offensive stereotypes, creating representations of gay characters that remain vitally important today. Robin Williams stars as Armand, owner of a gay cabaret who's married to his main attraction, drag queen Albert (Nathan Lane). Armand's son (Dan Futterman) is engaged to his girlfriend (Calista Flockhart), but worries how her father, a conservative Republican Senator (Hackman) mired in scandal, will react to meeting his two dads. Armand agrees to host the Senator and his wife (Dianne Wiest) for dinner, putting his lifestyle back in the closet for one night. But Albert refuses to stay hidden, leading to a hilarious comedy of errors. The critically acclaimed film, which won the SAG Ensemble prize and earned an Oscar nomination for best art direction, has become an audience favorite over the years, with its reputation far outlasting that of its famous predecessor.\n\nAlthough critical evaluation of it has changed over the years, there's no denying the power of \"Mississippi Burning,\" both as a politically charged thriller and as a performance showcase for Hackman. Directed by Alan Parker, it's loosely based on the true story of three Civil Rights workers who were murdered in deep-South Mississippi, seen through the eyes of the two FBI agents (Hackman and Willem Dafoe) investigating their disappearance. Though reviews at the time were largely positive, modern-day reviewers have criticized its lack of a Black perspective. Yet there's no faulting the atmospheric, tightly wound filmmaking, nor Hackman's performance, which earned one of the film's seven Oscar nominations. Playing a native southerner who often schools his young partner in the ways of the Mississippians who disgust him, the actor moves gracefully between good old boy charm and simmering rage, keeping the audience on their toes with each passing scene.\n\nAs far as inspirational sports movies go, \"Hoosiers\" sets the gold standard for what can be achieved in a genre that's often riddled with cliches and hokum. That's thanks largely to Hackman's performance, which avoids the usual stereotypes his character could fall into. He plays Norman Dale, a disgraced college basketball coach who's offered a chance at redemption in the form of coaching an underdog high school team in small-town Indiana. With the help of the town drunk (Dennis Hopper, who earned an Oscar nomination for the role), he whips the team into shape and saves his own soul in the process. The film certainly follows a formula, but as critics pointed out at the time, it does it so well you can't help but cheer by the end.\n\nIt's truly shocking that Hackman wasn't nominated for an Oscar for \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" not just because of the amount of precursor wins and bids he picked up along the way, but because of how integral he is to the film's lasting impact. As the wily Royal Tenenbaum, Hackman effortlessly walks the line between abhorrent behavior and rascally charm. Having walked out on his family years ago, Royal tries to reconnect with his wife (Anjelica Huston) and their three gifted yet deeply damaged children (Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Luke Wilson). Though it's rough going at first, the entire Tenenbaum clan is eventually won over by his freewheeling antics, and so are we. It remains the very best and most memorable performance in any Wes Anderson film, and that's saying a lot.\n\n\"Bonnie and Clyde\" not only launched Hackman's career, but also completely rewrote the rules for Hollywood filmmaking. Influenced by the more mature, experimental storytelling coming out of European cinema (particularly the French New Wave), it recounts the legendary story of Depression-era bank robbers Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway). Hackman plays Clyde's sensible older brother, Buck, who joins their crime spree with his wife, Blanche (Estelle Parsons), whose hysteria drives Bonnie crazy. \"Bonnie and Clyde\" sent shockwaves throughout Hollywood with its graphic violence and frank sexuality. Paired with \"The Graduate\" the same year (which Hackman almost starred in), it paved the way for more movies that spoke to the growing counterculture, forever closing the door on the Old Hollywood studio system. The film earned 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Hackman as best supporting actor, winning two (supporting actress for Parsons and cinematography).\n\nHackman won his second Oscar for Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western, which implicates both heroes and villains in the violence of the Old West. Eastwood directs and stars as Bill Munny, a retired gunslinger who left his killing ways behind to raise a family. He's dragged back into one more job when a prostitute is horribly disfigured by a pair of bandits. Will rides into the town of Big Whiskey with his partners, Ned (Morgan Freeman) and the Scofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), where they're greeted by sheriff Little Bill Daggert (Hackman), who in many ways is more sociopathically violent than the career killers. Hackman is ruthless in his performance, which creates a complex character out of a tired cliché. In addition to his supporting actor win, the film also took home trophies for best picture, best director, and best film editing.\n\nReleased right before the Watergate scandal forced Richard Nixon to resign from office, Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" brilliantly captures the paranoia and unease coursing through the 1970s American psyche. Hackman is at his best as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert spying on a young couple (Frederic Forrest and Cindy Williams). When reviewing the tapes, he hears a cryptic conversation that hints at possible violence headed the couple's way. But Coppola is interested in more than just standard thriller stuff: rather, \"The Conversation\" is more a character study about a man struggling between the duties of his job and his conscience. Hackman is riveting throughout as a mild-mannered man who slowly unravels as he's pushed to the brink. It's a performance that brought him best actor nominations at the Golden Globes and BAFTA, though not, surprisingly, at the Oscars, despite the film landing three bids, including best picture.\n\nChoosing the best film out of a career as long and rich as Hackman's can be a fool's errand, but if you had to pick one performance the actor will always be remembered for, it's that of Popeye Doyle in \"The French Connection.\" Based in part on a true story, William Friedkin's tightly wound police thriller broke new ground not just for its gritty, documentary-esque approach, but for its complex, nuanced take on the hero archetype. Popeye Doyle, an NYPD narcotics officer hunting down a French heroin dealer (Fernando Rey), is indicative of the kind of antiheroes '70s filmmaking explored: casually racist, prone to violence, yet determined to do the right thing. It's a high-wire act that only an actor as capable as Hackman can pull off. There's not a wasted moment in \"The French Connection,\" which features the greatest car chase ever committed to film. (Don't believe us? Watch it.) It's little wonder it won five Oscars, including best picture, best director, and best actor for Hackman, who returned for the 1975 sequel \"French Connection II.\""
