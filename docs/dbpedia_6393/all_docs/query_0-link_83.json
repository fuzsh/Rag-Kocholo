        "text": "Dudley Moore had what was arguably his definitive screen role in 1981's Arthur. He plays a lovable yet irresponsible millionaire who perpetually has a drink in his hand. He's faced with losing his family fortune unless he marries a socialite he doesn't love. Arthur is willing to do it, but then he falls in love with a waitress (Liza Minnelli). Suddenly he has to decide whether to follow his heart or keep his bank account happy. John Gielgud won an Oscar playing his tell-it-like-it-is butler.\n\nCasting Russell Brand in the Arthur remake - and getting Helen Mirren to play the butler - was a masterstroke on the surface. No one else was better suited. It was on the screenplay and direction levels that the updated Arthur failed. Rather than being the observant, sharp-edged comedy the original was, the 2011 picture goes goofy and broad. As a result, it's a forgone conclusion which woman the character will choose, whereas in Moore's version you weren't really sure until he made his final decision.\n\nIn other words, the \"love or money\" conundrum at the center of the story is downplayed. It's unclear why anybody wanted to remake Arthur without realistically dealing with the idea at its core.\n\nOn paper, remaking The Lion King with photorealistic computer imagery must have sounded like a good idea. The approach probably seemed as though it would bring a whole new perspective to the classic story. Well, it did, alright - just not in a good way.\n\nThe problem with the movie is that making the animals look real takes away their ability to project emotions. That's a requirement in animation. Characters are often drawn with exaggerated facial expressions to emphasize their reactions to whatever situation they're in. Because the remake wanted them to appear authentic, they generally have blank faces. (Animals don't smile, laugh, or cry.) The CGI additionally robs the characters of visual distinction. Telling who's who among the lions, for example, can be difficult given that they all look essentially the same.\n\nFailing to recognize these problems in advance, The Lion King merely retells the story in a different animation style, adding nothing new and even detracting from the themes. It looks cool, but it's soulless.\n\nNot many people would consider the 1975 movie Rollerball a classic, although it does have an appreciative cult audience. The movie depicts a future in which corporations control everything. America is in the grip of a violent sport that's kind of like roller derby with weapons. When the company controlling the game wants the star player (James Caan) out, he takes on the system to figure out why.\n\nBasically, Rollerball has two themes. One is that audiences crave increasingly violent forms of entertainment, and the second is that it's not a good thing when corporate decisions outweigh the decisions of individual people. The 2002 remake, with Chris Klein in the Caan role, largely ignores this sort of social commentary. The movie is interested only in jamming in as many action scenes as possible, with little or no extra context.\n\nAlso, given that the '75 Rollerball was fairly prescient about the ever-growing popularity of violent entertainment, the '02 version is a day late and a dollar short.\n\nHollywood studios didn't exactly shy away from dramatizing the Vietnam War - even when it was still going on - but many of the movies produced were reluctant to delve into the true existential toll the conflict had on the nation as a whole and the soldiers themselves. In 1986, Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning Platoon laid the groundwork for a new generation of thought-provoking examinations of the war.\n\nWhen Adrian Lyne's spooky Jacob's Ladder came out four years later, its depiction of the psychological aftermath of that war was bold and provocative. Audiences had not yet been confronted by what the picture had to say about post-traumatic stress disorder and the spiritual crises faced by those returning home from Vietnam. That made it as chilling as it was provocative.\n\nThe war in Afghanistan was awful in its own right, but - thanks to 24-hour cable news and the internet - people were able to learn about it and digest the harsh realities almost in real time. The remake of Jacob's Ladder mistakenly thought it could just substitute a more recent conflict to address the same subjects. Both versions deal with a veteran experiencing dissociation as a result of trauma, but the 1990 iteration of the tale had a built-in punch that the one released 19 years later was never going to be able to achieve.\n\nThe Hustle is a remake of 1988's Michael Caine/Steve Martin comedy Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, which was itself a remake of the 1964 Marlon Brando/David Niven film Bedtime Story. This version has a gender twist, casting actresses Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson in the roles of, respectively, a suave con artist and a less polished but more streetwise one. They're working together - and then competing - to bilk a rich mark out of a lot of money.\n\nThe whole point of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels was to show how the scam worked and how each con artist approached the prospect of \"reading\" a mark. The Hustle, on the other hand, rushes through its central sting so that it's never quite clear what their plan is. Not knowing that just leaves Hathaway and Wilson floundering through a bunch of dumb, unfunny slapstick scenes. The entire idea of delving into \"the art of the con\" is ignored.\n\nPaul Verhoeven's 1987 film RoboCop was so violent that it originally received an X rating. The studio insisted it be cut down to an R. Even with those trims, the excessiveness of the violence effectively drove home the movie's theme. Omni Consumer Products claims its robotic law enforcement technology will make Detroit safer, when in reality it creates a situation even more unstable. The company's ED-209 model proves wildly unreliable.\n\nThe 2014 remake of RoboCop, directed by Jose Padilha, attempted to remain true to the corporate and military-industrial satire yet missed the mark by a mile. Going for a PG-13 rating automatically meant the violence was toned down. When the whole point of the story is to make fun of the militarization of law enforcement by money-grubbing companies, being bloodless is the exact wrong way to go. You can't satirize something if you don't indulge in it a little bit. The remade RoboCop seemed more interested in catering to teenage audiences than it did in remaining faithful to the source material's intent.\n\nNo wonder it failed to achieve the cultural impact of the original. Heck, it didn't even achieve the cultural impact of RoboCop 2."
