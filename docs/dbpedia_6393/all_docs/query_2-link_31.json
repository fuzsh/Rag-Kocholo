        "text": "Deja vu is an occupational hazard when you're a film critic, and not just every time Hugh Grant puts out a romantic comedy. There are only so many ways to shoot a car chase, for example, while there have been so many movies located in a post-apocalyptic landscape of late I've started wondering which blasted wilderness would suit me best. (I'd probably go for the one in The Book of Eli due to its surfeit of British character actors. There may not be a lot of water to go around, but there'd be no shortage of ham.)\n\nSometimes, though, it takes a while to realise you've seen it all before. I was 20 minutes into Atom Egoyan's Chloe, for instance, before it dawned on me I'd already seen it, with a different cast in another language. It's a remake, you see, of a 2003 French film called Nathalie, in which Emmanuelle Béart played a hooker that Fanny Ardant hires to test her husband's fidelity. Amanda Seyfried and Julianne Moore play the lead roles in Egoyan's version, with Liam Neeson filling Gérard Depardieu's shoes as the husband who may or may not be doing the John Terry behind Moore's back.\n\nWhat I liked about the original was you were never sure if the lurid stories Béart brought back to Ardant about her nights with Depardieu were accurate reports of something that had actually happened or the erotic products of an overly active imagination. There's no such ambiguity in Chloe, which swiftly outs Seyfried as a demented lesbian fantasist from the Fatal Attraction school of bunny-boiling harpies. Apparently the decision to ramp up the thriller aspect came more from producer Ivan Reitman than Egoyan himself, a hired gun who came on board fairly late in the day. Creaky suspense, sadly, is a poor substitute for psychological mystery, resulting in a half-baked affair that feels like an arthouse take on Single White Female. Could they not have left well enough alone?\n\nI had the same feeling watching Everybody's Fine, out this Friday, an Americanised rehash of Giuseppe Tornatore's 1990 film about a lonely widower who pays surprise visits on his grown-up children. I haven't seen the Marcello Mastroianni original, but it surely can't have been as mawkishly unendurable as Kirk Jones's version, an About Schmidt wannabe in which Robert De Niro spends vast lengths of the story sitting on a bus or a train looking glum and unwanted. Turns out, of course, that Everybody's Not Fine, leading to a truly awful fantasy scene in which Bobby hectors the younger versions of his estranged kids around a garden picnic table about all the things they've kept from him. You half expect him to whip out a lie detector, like he did with Ben Stiller in Meet the Parents.\n\nWhy does Hollywood persist in remaking European films? Maybe they think no one will notice. (Few appeared to with Brothers, a dreary Yankification of a Danish original from 2004.) Then again, it could be down to simple snobbery: the idea that anything imported from across the water must automatically have class and authority. (That would certainly explain Simon Cowell.) Rightly or wrongly, the qualities people associate with \"foreign\" movies tend to be the same ones to which many US film-makers aspire – sophistication, worldliness, restraint and finesse. If a movie has succeeded on its home turf, meanwhile, there's a sound financial argument to be made that the same story will click with a wider audience, once you've got shot of all those pesky subtitles.\n\nTrouble is, the moment the studios get their hands on these movies they seem to instantly lose faith in them, gutting out all the things that made them distinctive and replacing them with sentimental homilies and hackneyed cliches. It's like a huge case of buyer's remorse that ensures every property that crosses the Atlantic ends up stripped of the very elements that made it worth remaking in the first place. Oddly, though, the same truism applies even when the films are refashioned by their original architects. You only have to look at Michael Haneke's ineffectual English-language redo of Funny Games, for example, to see there's very little to be gained, and an awful lot to lose."
