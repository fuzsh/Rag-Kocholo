As Russell Brand has the audacity to star in a recreation of Arthur, the treasured home of Dudley Moore, we look at the nasty movie remake habit and wonder: should rehashes be allowed? Under what conditions? Are some cows too sacred? How can the worst copycats be punished?\n\nBrand plays the role created by Moore in 1981, and if the American reviews are anything to go by, the new Arthur is a whimpering travesty of the original. “Dud, not Dudley,” said one review. Another piled in with “Hollywood has Russelled up an irritating, exhausting fiasco.” Sozzled billionaires sit uneasily in times of recession, and “even the addition of Helen Mirren can’t save this one”."
