        "text": "By default, the top new release of the weekend will be Diane Lane and Kevin Costner’s surprisingly terrific Let Him Go. The 1960’s-set western, about two grandparents mourning the death of their adult son and embarking on a quest to retrieve their grandson from their former daughter-in-law’s scary new family, works as a small-scale thriller and a mournful tragedy.\n\nIf it were to top the box office, it would be Kevin Costner’s first star-vehicle chart-topper since Nicolas Sparks’ Message in a Bottle ($21 million) in February of 1999. That’s not to say he’s been in a slump since then, as he has become a reliable supporting actor/added-value element to the likes of Man of Steel, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit and Hidden Figures.\n\nSo, in light of his return to screens this weekend, I wanted to round up his biggest grossing movies, in order of inflation-adjusted domestic gross. I will note that his turns in Man of Steel ($290 million domestic/$668 million worldwide in 2013) and Hidden Figures ($169 million/$236 million in 2016) are both underrated, partially because they both had almost comically-misinterpreted “trailer beats.”\n\nNo, Snyder, Nolan and Goyer weren’t arguing that Clark’s adopted dad was so selfish and cold-hearted that he’d rather watch innocent children die than have Clark reveal his secret powers. The moment in Hidden Figures when Costner’s NASA boss destroys a “for whites only” restroom sign about how white folks take notice of racism when it begins to affect their lives and/or their bottom line. Anyway, without further ado…\n\n11. Open Range (Disney)\n\n$58 million domestic in 2013/$81 million adjusted\n\nCostner’s third directorial effort sees the filmmaker and actor delivering a new classic in the modern western sub-genre. Starring Robert Duvall, Costner and Annette Benning, the richly acted and thoughtful western climaxes with one of the greatest protracted onscreen shoot outs I’ve ever seen. The film opened right during the great Northeast Blackout of 2003, but strong reviews and good buzz helped the film leg out to over 4x its $14 million debut weekend. The $22 million flick totaled $68.3 million worldwide.\n\n10. Message in a Bottle (Warner Bros.)\n\n$52.8 million in 1999/$87.3 million adjusted\n\nStarring Kevin Costner and Robin Wright, Message in a Bottle was the first of what turned out to be a sub-genre of romantic melodramas based on the books of Nicolas Sparks. It earned $118 million worldwide, better than any Sparks adaptation that would follow. Its inflation-adjusted domestic gross sits behind only The Notebook ($81 million in 2004/$109 million adjusted). Of course, since it cost $80 million (!!), it wasn’t necessarily a hit from theaters alone.\n\n9. Tin Cup (Warner Bros.)\n\n$53.85 million in 1996/$102.2 million adjusted\n\nWaterworld was a disappointment considering the budget and the accusations of hubris, so Costner reunited with Ron Shelton for this golf-centric romantic comedy. Rene Russo is a wonderful romantic foil, while Don Johnson (as a professional and romantic rival) solidifies himself as a crusty character actor. The film earned $53 million worldwide on a $45 million budget, but at least it had great reviews and one of the very best endings ever for any sports flick.\n\n8. Bull Durham (Orion)\n\n$50.88 million in 1988/$103.88 million adjusted\n\nWritten and directed by Ron Shelton, this R-rated, and refreshingly adult (then and now) baseball-themed romantic comedy earned $58 million worldwide on a $7.5 million budget. The picture involves a romantic triangle between an over-the-hill minor league catcher (Costner), a talented young pitcher with a shot at the majors (Tim Robbins) and the baseball groupie who enjoys “mentoring” ball players (Susan Sarandon). The triple-punch of No Way Out and The Untouchables in 1987 along with Bull Durham in 1988 turned Kevin Costner into movie star.\n\n7. Field of Dreams (Universal)\n\n$64.4 million in 1989/$136.2 million adjusted\n\nBased on W.P. Kinsella’s novel Shoeless Joe, Field of Dreams remains a towering piece of Hollywood fantasy melodrama. Beyond the catchphrases and father/son bonding beats, it’s about the generation gap, with the children of the 1960’s coming to terms with adulthood and the idealists of the era (personified by a shoulda-won-an-Oscar James Earl Jones) coming to terms with cruel reality. Phil Alden Robinson pulls off a still-incredible balancing act, partially thanks to Burt Lancaster (in his final role) as a beloved small-town doctor who came to terms with the dreams that didn’t come true.\n\n6. JFK (Warner Bros.)\n\n$70.4 million in 1991/$142 million adjusted)\n\nThe movie that defined Oliver Stone not just as a fiery cinematic provocateur but a would-be conspiracy theorist, JFK isn’t so much about what really happened but how America reacted to it and how the information we had could so easily fit into any theoretical explanation. I don’t know how much of JFK, which stars Costner as DA Jim Garrison, is truthful, but it’s incredibly entertaining either way. It’s relentlessly exciting, stunningly edited and deliciously acted in service of a political screed that actually restarted the national conversation around the crime.\n\n5. The Untouchables (Paramount PGRE )\n\n$76.27 million in 1987/$163.65 million adjusted\n\nBrian DePalma’s and David Mamet’s kick-ass adaptation of the Robert Stack/Neville Brand TV show is almost comically fictional in terms of turning the Prohibition-era pursuit of Al Capone into a white-knuckle action spectacular. But from the opening Ennio Morricone theme through to the closing credits, this Kevin Costner star vehicle just rocks and rocks hard. Robert De Niro hams it up as Al Capone while Sean Connery won an Oscar and cemented a post-007 commercial comeback as the film’s fictionalized “Obi-Wan Kenobi” to Costner’s Luke Skywalker. The Untouchables was a slightly ahead-of-its-time example of turning a TV show into a top-tier, very serious Hollywood movie.\n\n4. Waterworld (Universal)\n\n$88.2 million in 1995/$170.2 million adjusted\n\nEarning $268 million worldwide on a then-record $175 million budget, Kevin Reynolds’ Waterworld has, at the very least, broken even over the last 25 years. It even spawned a long-running (and terrific) Universal Studios UVV stunt show spectacular. Hobbled by a pre-release media determined to knock Costner down a peg, the film felt, even in 1995, as one of the last examples of pure practical filmmaking. The money mostly went to the real sets, the real vehicles and the real stunts that brought this “Mad Max on water” action fantasy to life.\n\n3. The Bodyguard (Warner Bros.)\n\n$122 million in 1992/$246.8 million adjusted\n\nCritics weren’t big on this admittedly formulaic melodrama/thriller, but audiences made it the second R-rated movie (after Terminator 2) to top $400 million worldwide. Costner stars as, spoiler, a bodyguard hired to protect an imperiled pop star (Whitney Houston, natch). They fall in love, even if they don’t act on it due to (take your pick) professionalism or institutional racism. The film is best known for Houston’s powerhouse remake of Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You,” but it was so successful that I am shocked that it hasn’t been remade with, say, Henry Golding and Ariana Grande.\n\n2. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (Warner Bros.)\n\n$165.5 million in 1991/$329.8 million adjusted\n\nSave for Tim Burton’s Batman ($411 million in 1989), Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was the biggest grossing IP-specific superhero movie until Spider-Man in 2002. The $50 million spectacular, ridiculed in its day for Costner’s grounded performance (and his poor English accent), the film earned $390 million worldwide and offered an ahead-of-its-time template for grimdark reboots. Audiences loved it, and frankly the movie has aged well as a bonkers-bananas Hollywood blockbuster where every actor (Costner, Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman, etc.) seems to be acting in a different movie.\n\n1. Dances with Wolves (Orion)\n\n$184.2 million in 1990/$366.6 million adjusted\n\nCostner became king of the Hollywood mountain after this passion project, a three-hour, ultraviolent (and yet PG-13) adaptation of Michael Blake’s Civil War-era novel, became a cultural and commercial sensation. Whether it “deserved” its Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director (sorry Goodfellas fans), this was a towering cinematic achievement that served as a gateway drug for generations of moviegoers slowly learning about America’s less than idealistic past in terms of Native Americans. Sure, it may be “problematic” today, but it was a bolt of corrective cinematic lightning at the time."
