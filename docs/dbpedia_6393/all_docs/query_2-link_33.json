        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nChapter 5 cycle consciousness and the white audience in black film writing: the 1949–1950 “race problem” cycle and the african american press steven doles In 1949 and 1950, Hollywood studios and independent production companies released five films that were commonly identified with one another as constituting a “race problem” cycle because of their narratives centering on representations of African Americans facing segregation and discrimination: Home of the Brave (1949, Mark Robson ), Lost Boundaries (1949, Alfred L. Werker), Pinky (1949, Elia Kazan ), Intruder in the Dust (1949, Clarence Brown), and No Way Out (1950, Joseph L. Mankiewicz). The race problem cycle was itself part of a larger postwar trend of social problem films dealing with race and racism, following most directly on two films of 1947 about antiSemitism , Crossfire (Edward Dmytryk) and Gentleman’s Agreement (Elia Kazan). Contemporary reception materials for the race problem cycle typically group the five films together, taking them seriously not primarily as entertainments, but rather as works making arguments about the desirability of change in the social standing of African Americans and the unacceptability of certain expressions of racism. Examined textually, however, the films of the cycle evince as many differences as similarities. Home of the Brave draws extensively on the generic conventions of the war film, and by focusing on the healing of an African American soldier who becomes psychologically disabled when he joins a reconnaissance mission and faces hatred from members of the otherwise all-white unit, it resembles returningveteran films such as Pride of the Marines (1945, Delmer Daves) and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946, William Wyler), with their interest in representing the exterior and interior effects of war trauma. Lost Boundaries borrows conventions from producer Louis de Rochemont ’s March of Time newsreel series in adapting a nonfiction story cycle consciousness & white audience in black film writing 81 of a family that passed racially in a small New England town, finding acceptance in the community even once their “transgression” is revealed . Pinky, another passing narrative, moves its nurse protagonist from the North back to her origins in the South, where she can no longer pass. After Pinky leaves her fiancé, who wants her to conceal her background and move with him to a place where her race will be unknown, the film shifts its focus to legal challenges to Pinky’s right to inherit property from a white benefactor, the happy resolution of which allows her to open a (segregated) hospital for the African Americans of the town. Intruder in the Dust (an adaptation of the William Faulkner novel) and No Way Out are crime films in which investigation narratives drive toward the clearing of their central African American characters for the death of a white person, yet the former features a rural southern setting in which the threat of lynching is key to the story line, and No Way Out an urban northern setting in which the conflict between black and white characters erupts in a violent riot. Establishing these films as members of the same cycle is thus a selective process that highlights certain features of the films while filtering out others. Cycles are constituted as much by their pragmatics—how communities make use of and respond to films—as by their semantics— repeated elements such as settings, character types, and props—and their syntax—narrative patterns common across a group of films. Films do not bear signs of their membership in cycles textually, but rather intertextually, through the work of industry professionals who decide what projects to film and how to promote them, based on commercial precedent and their feel for what audiences will pay for, and through the audiences who view the films, noticing connections between them and giving significance to repeated elements. In this chapter I examine the latter, audience-directed process as it occurred in coverage of the race problem cycle in the black press.1 This coverage included not only reviews but also production notices, announcements and reports of screenings, gossip columns, editorials, columnists ’ essays, and letters from readers. This diverse material, ranging from brief items to lengthy articles, was sometimes fragmentary or contradictory, and writers in the same periodicals occasionally offered contrasting responses to the same films. I highlight a specific way of writing about these films, one that expresses an awareness of their membership within the cycle, an awareness that I call “cycle consciousness.” [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-16 17:46 GMT) 82 steven doles Because cycles..."
