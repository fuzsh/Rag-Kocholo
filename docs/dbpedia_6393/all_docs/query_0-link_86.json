        "text": "Sometimes giving new life or a new spin to an old movie can be a breath of fresh air, other times it’s just a waste of oxygen. Welcome to WatchMojo.com, today we are counting down our picks for the Top 10 Upcoming Reboots/Remakes No One Wants.\n\nFor this list, we’re looking at movies that are slated for an English-language remake or a reboot and/or that have been listed on IMDB.com with at least a pre-production status as of early 2018. Projects that are on hold or stalled are still eligible, but those with confirmed cancellation are not. Note that the status of these projects are subject to change in the future, but we’ll try to go with the most up-to-date information available at this time.\n\n#10: “Drop Dead Fred” (1991)\n\nTargeted to children and families, this British-American production didn’t actually appeal to all ages thanks to its more grownup themes and dark comedy elements. “Drop Dead Fred” follows a young woman who sees the return of the chaotic imaginary friend from her childhood during a particularly trying time in her adult life. The film returned to public attention when Universal spoke of remaking it with Russell Brand in the titular role in 2009, and it made the social media rounds following actor Rik Mayall’s 2014 death. But with 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, Gene Siskel calling it 1991’s “worst film,” and a storyline that includes emotional abuse, we’d just rather this potential reboot drop dead.\n\n#9: “Cliffhanger” (1993)\n\nThis is not a film for the faint of heart, or those with acrophobia. The original was an action packed Sylvester Stallone fest with many daring aerial shots and edge of your seat stunts that had audiences buzzing. The rumors of a reboot with producer Neal H. Moritz of the Total Recall and 21 Jump Street remakes producing began circulating in 2009. But given the original is considered one of Sly’s best films, and that it had visuals that’ve held up surprising well over the years, this leaves us wondering if the reboot won’t just be hung out to dry.\n\n#8: “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” (1988)\n\nIf it worked the first time, why not do it again, right? Given that this Steve Martin/Michael Caine-led comedy - itself a remake of 1964’s Bedtime Stories - won over audiences, a redo would be welcomed, right? Well, Hollywood may only be conning themselves with this idea. The “Nasty Women”-titled remake will have Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson in the starring roles and is set for an August 2018 release. While there is nothing wrong with giving a girl-powered revision to a great film, and both women have been known to deliver laughs, one has to worry if this new movie won’t turn out to be snake oil.\n\n#7: “An American Werewolf in London”(1981)\n\nIt seems like almost every iconic horror movie is up for remake grabs, and to be fair, they haven’t always been a disaster. When a movie is as iconic and innovative as this one, however, the idea of a remake makes us want to howl at the moon in protest. With its eerie atmosphere, groundbreaking effects, and talented cast, there is little doubt that a reboot would ever do the original justice – though 2016 news that director John Landis’ son is set to take the reins does give us a small bit of hope. Set to be a modernization of this early ‘80s creature feature, one has to wonder if CGI will end up shooting a silver bullet into the transformation scene that still remains one of the most iconic shots in horror cinema.\n\n#6: “Commando”(1985)\n\nOf course, at some point you had to expect an Arnie movie to show up on a list of reboots and remakes – they’re practically an industry onto itself. Commando, an ‘80s borderline cheese-fest about a retired Delta Force colonel trying to get back his kidnapped daughter, is rumored to be getting the remake treatment. While a Russian remake was produced in 2008, we’re specifically referring to talk about a potential Hollywood update that’s been making the rounds since 2010. With all of the early 21st century films about kidnappers getting their due after a parent fights back against their demands, one does have to wonder what a remake of this action flick might possibly have to offer that hasn’t been done before, and again, and again.\n\n#5: “Splash” (1984)\n\nWhen it comes to movie do-overs, there certainly seems to be an ocean of possibilities, and romantic comedies are certainly fair game. Case in point, Splash is reportedly slated for a redo, albeit with a gender flip: this time, Channing Tatum is set as the merman who finds himself as a fish out of water after falling for a human. As a moderately amusing film, the original is often cited as a soft spot for those fond of Tom Hanks. As such, it’s hard to imagine Tatum as a wide-eyed naïve innocent, or adding anything to the role played so well by Daryl Hannah.\n\n#4: “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” (1994)\n\nLet’s start by saying this isn't a bad movie, and it isn't a great movie, but it's a movie that works because of Jim Carrey. Which is kind of the point when it comes to why this remake is unneeded and unwanted, as Carrey and his animated expressions are pretty much synonymous with the character. While Morgan Creek Entertainment Group has said that they plan to make a movie that is more in the spirit of Ace Ventura than an actual remake, hoping it might lead to a series franchise, we have some serious doubts that it will live up to their expectations, or the original film.\n\n#3: “Memento” (2000)\n\nAlthough it seems odd calling something written and directed by Christopher Nolan an indie film, this is what this turn of the millennium thriller was. It was also one of his earliest directorial projects. The story of a man with an inability to build new memories, trying desperately to solve his wife’s murder, told both forward and in reverse – it's the film that built the Nolan name and introduced his style to the masses. Except, he doesn't seem to be involved in the potential remake, which is instead the cash-grab daydream of its new rights holder, AMBI Pictures, who want to remake it due the original’s popularity.\n\n#2: “The Birds”(1963)\n\nWhenever you hear about the possible remake of a Hitchcock film, it's impossible to not think of Gus Van Sant’s version of Psycho. But when you add to the rumor the idea that Michael Bay will produce, the conversation becomes unsettling. While he may be a master at explosive action, he is not a director known for slow burning suspense. The Birds is one of Hitchcock’s best-known masterpieces. It has managed to build tension through subtle imagery, and succeeded in making birds as scary as sharks or snakes. There seems little that could be gained by redoing this film, and so, so little need for it. And yet, in mid-2017 the BBC announced a TV adaptation set for 2018, with updates about the Bay version - announced back in 2014 - being scarce.\n\nBefore we reveal our number one pick here are some honorable, or rather, dishonorable mentions.\n\n“Weird Science” (1985)\n\n“Overboard” (1987)\n\n#1: “Scarface” (1983)\n\nThis is another case of planning to remake a film that was already itself a remake. However, the 1983 remake that so many love did so well that it’s still considered one of the greatest gangster films of all time. It is an iconic film, often quoted, often parodied, and forever equated with Al Pacino’s amazing and amazingly over the top performance. It’s hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Tony Montana, or more perfectly shot cinematography. So in this case, we’d like to say goodbye to our little friend, the remake... even if the Coen Brothers are attached as of February 2017."
