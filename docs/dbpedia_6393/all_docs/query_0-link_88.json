        "text": "Dance movies seem to strike that perfect balance between edge-of-your-seat action and irresistible romance. Even if you’re not a dancer yourself (but especially if you are!), you can’t help but tap your toes while rooting for the good guy in the inevitable dance-off. If you think you’re the only one who likes dance movies, trust — you’re not! There are tons of great dance movies throughout history to prove that most people keep coming back for more.\n\nFrom Old Hollywood to animated flicks for kids to the dark undertones and cinematic drama of Black Swan, chances are there’s a great dance movie out there for just about anyone. Ready to spend your next movie sesh watching your favorite stars duke it out on the dance floor? You’ve come to the right place for the inspo you need to queue it up!\n\nWe’ve rounded up some of our faves that include all the best hip-hop dance movies, ballet movies and of course, dance battle movies. If you find yourself watching the Pulp Fiction dance over and over or revisiting movies like Dirty Dancing every time you’ve had a bad day, you’re going to love these.\n\n1. Suspiria (2018)\n\nWhen it comes to dancing movies, this one is tense, there’s no getting around that. When a young American ballet dancer (Susie Bannion, played by Dakota Johnson) travels to Berlin to join a prestigious dance company, it doesn’t take too long for her to realize something is seriously amiss. After accusing the company’s directors of witchcraft, many sinister secrets are unveiled. And you’d better believe there are some haunting dance scenes that come with it. Like Black Swan, this is one of those ballet movies you won’t soon forget.\n\n2. La La Land (2016)\n\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling are not professional dancers, and that’s what makes this movie so intriguing. The duo fall in love while pursuing their respective career dreams (a jazz pianist for Gosling and an aspiring actress for Stone). The movie culminates in an incredible waltz, but there are plenty of footloose moments throughout the film. The movie-musical is paced by the various dance numbers, which seem to tell a better love story than any script can.\n\n3. Take the Lead (2006)\n\nTwo different types of dancing come together in this film, where Antonio Banderas plays a renowned dancer named Pierre Dulaine. After taking a job as a teacher at a New York City school, he helps introduce the students to ballroom dancing—and not without a fair amount of ridicule. In the end, the students’ hip-hop moves meld with Dulaine’s ballroom style, creating a beautiful new style and tons of feel-good, student-teacher moments.\n\n4. Frances Ha (2012)\n\nFrances Ha tells the story of chaotic early days in New York City, making it work while maintaining dreams. The main character, Frances, takes on a job apprenticing at a dance company and navigates the wild world of New York City apartment hunting, losing a best friend, and opening up to the idea of being loved.\n\n5. Napoleon Dynamite (2004)\n\nThis may not be your first thought when you’re tallying your favorite movies about dance. While there may only be one main dance scene in this movie, it’s now become required watching. Jon Heder completely nails a talent show choreography scene before scampering offstage. It only took a few minutes to make this the most memorable scene in the entire film, inspiring kids around the world to learn the moves themselves. And that kind of makes it a movie about dance, right?\n\n6. Birds of Paradise (2021)\n\nInspired by the novel “Bright Burning Stars,” this movie centers around Kate Sanders, a dancer from Virginia, and Marine Durand, a fellow dancer at the prestigious dance academy where they both study. This is both an edge-of-your-seat drama and a coming-of-age film, where sexual identities are explored as they both compete against each other to win a contract at the Opéra national de Paris.\n\n7. The Greatest Showman (2017)\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to see Zendaya and Hugh Jackman (among others) dance across the stage in elaborate costumes to painstaking choreography, settle in. The Greatest Showman follows the life of P. T. Barnum as he takes out a loan and attempts to create a show no one has ever seen before.\n\n8. Climax (2018)\n\nThis movie is a trip in the most literal sense. The plot follows a group of dancers who attended the same party one night. After ingesting drug-laced sangria, the night dissolves into a mess of murder and terror. And while this is certainly not one for those looking for a lighthearted watch, there are some incredible dance scenes and outfits.\n\n9. Hustlers (2019)\n\nThis movie has so many great names, it’s impossible not to drop it on your watch list: cardi B., Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Julia Stiles, Lizzo, and Keke Palmer all make appearances. The movie tells the true story of a crew of New York City pole dancers who swindled Wall Street clientele out of millions of dollars.\n\n10. Strictly Ballroom (1992)\n\nIt’s a classic tale: a professional dancer with hopes of spicing up the ballroom dancing scene pairs up with a less-than-coordinated local girl to make their dreams of becoming national champion dancers come true. This Australian rom-com is a classic for both it’s dance scenes and the relatable plot of having to pave your own way.\n\n11. Black Swan (2010)\n\nThe jury’s out as to whether Black Swan is actually scary. But one thing’s for sure — it’s about as dance-tastic as dance movies get. The dance sequences are incredible in this movie, but it’s also pretty disturbing. Natalie Portman plays Nina, a ballerina who becomes completely consumed by her dark leading role. Every other character in the film — including Lily, played by Mila Kunis — is portrayed through Nina’s eyes, so it’s hard to know if we ever really meet the other characters’ true selves.\n\n12. Feel the Beat (2020)\n\nThere are lots of great dance movies on Netflix, and this one is no exception. When April’s (Sofia Carson) dreams of hitting the big time in dance are dashed, she returns hope and finds lots of fulfillment teaching dance to little ones. Alex Owens is a factory worker by day and a night club dancer by night. Her greatest dream? To get into a prestigious dance conservatory and become a full-time professional dancer.\n\n13. Flashdance (1983)\n\nAlex Owens is a factory worker by day and a night club dancer by night. Her greatest dream? To get into a prestigious dance conservatory and become a full-time professional dancer. We dare you not to sign up for dance classes after watching this classic.\n\n14. Footloose (1984, 2011)\n\nIronically, one of the greatest dance movies of all time is about a town where dancing is not allowed. Maybe that’s why it was remade in 2011. Not only will both versions of this movie inspire you to take dance lessons, you’ll also be singing the songs on the soundtrack for the rest of your life.\n\n15. Dirty Dancing (1987)\n\nIf dance movies were ever to be ranked, it’s a guarantee the Dirty Dancing movie would come out on top. You just can’t find romance like that final dance scene anywhere else, and you’ll walk away feeling totally pumped. With a soundtrack that reads like the best of the ‘80s, and Patrick Swayze (equal parts badass and softie) in the lead role, you can’t beat Dirty Dancing when it comes to be the best dance movies of all time.\n\n16. And Then We Danced (2019)\n\nJust try to sit still during this flick. Packed with friendship, romance and oh so much dancing (incorporating lots of different genres, too), this dance movie has a little of everything. And we’re apt to believe Center Stage is partially to thank for a wave of amazing hip-hop dance movies that followed. Either way, the choreography is top-notch, and we’re still obsessed with that epic routine at the end (not to mention Jody’s iconic red dress and pointe shoes).\n\n19. Save the Last Dance (2001)\n\nSave the Last Dance came out on the heels of 10 Things I Hate About You, and basically cemented Julia Stiles as a darling of the '00s teen movies. Save the Last Dance contains a solid blend of ballet and hip-hop dance, and we’d be lying if we said we didn’t partially love it because Derek (played by Sean Patrick Thomas) is super dreamy.\n\n20. The Nutcracker (1993)\n\nThis film adaptation of the famous ballet stars a still-adorable Macaulay Culkin alongside dancers from the New York City Ballet. There’s plenty of dancing, and this movie really brings the magic of the holiday season full circle. It’s a great choice if you’re looking for the best ballet movies for the holidays.\n\n21. Chicago (2002)\n\nBased on the musical of the same name, the film Chicago starred Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renée Zellweger as the iconic Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart. The movie musical incorporates classic Bob Fosse choreography which translated almost seamlessly from the stage to the big screen. Also, the dance that Velma and Roxie do together at the end of the movie is the perfect duet to try to learn with your bestie.\n\n22. Honey (2003)\n\nHoney is a solid staple in the dance film genre. It stars Jessica Alba as the title character, Honey Daniels, who teaches hip-hop to kids and dreams of becoming a famous music video choreographer. She gets her big break when she’s asked to star in a music video herself. Mekhi Phifer and Joy Bryant co-star as the boyfriend and best friend, respectively, who help keep our fledgling choreographer grounded.\n\n23. Step Up (2006)\n\nStep Up, better known as “the movie that made us fall in love with Channing Tatum,” obviously deserves a spot on this list. Like Save the Last Dance, Step Up does a good job of fusing ballet and hip hop through the interests of its main characters. In addition to Tatum, this dance film also stars Alyson Stoner and Jenna Dewan.\n\n24. Billy Elliot (2000)\n\nThe protagonist and title character, 11-year-old Billy Elliot, could literally dance circles around most of us. Set in England in 1984, the movie follows Billy as he ditches boxing and enrolls in a ballet class to follow his real passion. This film actually has a great message, as it reminds us that we should always be true to ourselves no matter what.\n\n25. Saturday Night Fever (1977)\n\nBefore there was Grease, there was Saturday Night Fever. Let’s face it, Danny Zuko is pretty similar to Tony Manero, John Travolta’s character in Saturday Night Fever. That iconic white suit Tony wears on the poster? It’s basically Danny’s outfit in the “Hand Jive” scene in Grease. Saturday Night Fever will go down in history as one of the best dance movies ever, and the music might make you fall in love with disco. Seriously.\n\n26. Magic Mike (2012)\n\nMike Lane, played by Channing Tatum, works several jobs, but his greatest ambition is to make furniture. Along the way, however, he discovers his natural talent for dancing — and it's not all about sexy body rolls. He's actually really good! With unforgettable routines and giggle-inducing outfits, this is a dance movie unlike any other.\n\n27. Magic Mike XXL (2015)\n\nChanning Tatum strikes again! Not only was he amazing in Step Up and Magic Mike, he brings his unparalleled dance moves back to the big screen in Magic Mike XXL. And ... well ... thank goodness he did. This time, Mike and the boys are back, and they’re taking their show on the road. Trust us, you won’t be sorry. While the first film was a dark drama from Steven Soderbergh, the latter was a delightful story of a road trip… or, a bro-adtrip, if you will, and features a Donald Glover serenade.\n\n28. Stomp the Yard (2007)\n\nStomp the Yard is a true gem among dance movies. It centers around a street dancer named DJ who goes to college and joins a fraternity. Once in school, he enters a step dancing competition with his frat brothers. Stomp the Yard offers some seriously impressive combinations that you’ll be dying to try after watching. This flick definitely tops the list of must-see dance battle movies.\n\n29. Shall We Dance? (2004)\n\nIn this flick, we watch the burgeoning romance blossom between buttoned-up lawyer John Clark, played by Richard Gere, and his dance teacher Paulina, played by Jennifer Lopez. What ensues is a magical foray into the world of ballroom dance. Not only is it one of the best dance movies ever, it's one of JLo's best films, too.\n\n30. Burlesque (2010)\n\nReal life dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov stars as a ballet dancer who has defected from the Soviet Union and is desperately trying to escape, all while still dancing, of course. The film features tons of inspiring dance scenes and also stars a young Gregory Hines, Helen Mirren, and Isabella Rosellini.\n\n36. Dancers (1987)\n\nBallet greats Mikhail Baryshnikov, Alessandra Ferri and the completely adorable Julie Kent are caught in a love triangle in this classic dance movie. It’s worth a watch if you’re looking for great dance scenes with a splash of romance.\n\n37. Leap! (2017)\n\nWe've got to include this computer-animated cartoon in our list of best dance movies. It chronicles the story of a young orphan (voiced by Elle Fanning) who gets into a dance school in Paris and sets out to follow her dream of becoming a professional dancer, against all odds. The heartwarming film emphasizes the importance of not only having technique, but having passion.\n\n38. You Got Served (2004)\n\nWatch as Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, and Rita Moreno dance their hearts out in this classic movie musical that won ten Academy Awards.\n\n43. High Strung (2016)\n\nSet against the glamour backdrop of Manhattan, this modern dance film tells the story of a privileged ballerina who falls in love with a struggling violinist. It culminates, of course, with a dance competition.\n\n44. The White Crow (2019)\n\nThis biographical dance film, directed by Ralph Fiennes, follows the esteemed career of one of the greatest ballet dancers of all time, Rudolf Nureyev. He escapes the Soviet Union and seeks asylum in France, where he continues to dance until he dies due to health complications from AIDs.\n\n45. Gotta Kick It Up (2002)"
