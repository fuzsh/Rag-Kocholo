        "text": "Marilyn Fisher\n\nDr. Brooks (Sidney Poitier) confronts Ray Biddle (Richard Widmark) after being accused of murdering his brother in “No Way Out” (1950). Photo credit: https://silverscreenings.org\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor Sidney Poitier plays Dr. Luther Brooks, an African American man who has just begun his residency in the prison wing of the county hospital. His first case is the treatment of two criminal brothers, one of whom, Ray Biddle, is a raging racist. When Ray’s brother Johnny dies while Dr. Brooks is performing a spinal tap, Johnny blames his death on Dr. Brooks because of his race. The Biddle brother’s death exacerbates the racial tensions that exist in the town, and violence between both sides is seemingly inevitable. The reputation of the county hospital, his own reputation, and the safety of his family hang in the balance as Dr. Brooks works to clear his name and combat discrimination.\n\n“No Way Out” is a powerful film depicting the difficulties faced by people of color entering the medical field at the turn of the twentieth century, and its release coincided with the birth of the civil rights movement. Dr. Brooks faces subtle racism from his fellow doctors at the hospital, who mistake him for an orderly or the elevator operator. This affects Dr. Brooks psychologically, hurting his confidence in his medical skill. It takes the encouragement of his wife and his mentor Dr. Wharton to convince Brooks that he is as equally qualified as any white doctor. One of the most moving scenes is when Dr. Brooks calmly and professionally dresses Ray Biddle’s wound while Ray shouts racial slurs in his face. Dr. Brooks’ ethics are put to the test when he is confronted with this blind racism, and Poitier does a fantastic job of portraying a young doctor struggling to put aside his personal problems and treat every patient to the best of his ability.\n\nProgressive for its time, this movie is (amazingly!) still relevant today. Stereotypes persist in the medical field on both the sides of the doctor-patient relationship, inhibiting truly effective care. A patient may refuse to cooperate with a doctor because he/she does not fit the patient’s schema of a medical professional. This incongruity could be because of factors such as race, sex, or even age. Likewise, a doctor may form inaccurate judgements about a patient from his/her physical appearance instead a referring to the patient’s medical history, such as attributing an illness to obesity because the patient looks overweight. As pre-med students, it is important to be aware of these potential biases and be advocates of inclusivity.\n\nI have always loved watching classic movies, getting a shiver down my spine whenever the MGM lion began to roar. The actors, the dialogue, the fashion (oh the fashion!) are all from a different time, but sit in front of “the tube” and they are here, now, just like they were at the film’s premiere. It is important to understand and appreciate the past; classic films help one to grasp the ideas of a generation or the social and political atmosphere of a time period. Movies also give you a chance to hear and experience, somewhat vicariously, the lives of others, expanding your knowledge beyond your own personal worldview.\n\n“No Way Out” shows the awakening of the public conscience in the 50s to racial injustice and the rise of a social realist film genre that dealt with more gritty and controversial subject matters (see “kitchen sink drama”). It is interesting to contrast this genre with the extravagant sword and sandal epics and saccharine sitcoms which dominated that decade. Poitier’s performance in “No Way Out” paved the way for larger roles in more famous racial dramas during the 1960’s, including “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” and “In the Heat of the Night” (both released in 1967). In “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” Poitier again portrays an idealistic doctor, but one who is engaged to the daughter of white San Francisco liberals. Two observations can be made here: not only had racial tensions remained unsolved over the almost two-decade span between the films, but Poitier remained the only black leading man in Hollywood.\n\nThe goal of these reviews is not only to discuss the portrayal of medicine in the media, but also to make broader historical and cultural connections. This variant of close reading (perhaps “close viewing” is a better term) involves delving beyond the surface of a work and investigating the conglomeration of factors and motivations that influenced it. It is an important skill for many studies in the humanities, but is also vitally important for those in the sciences. Just like enzyme cascades that trigger a response to stimuli, all events are determined by a myriad of interconnected elements. It is learning to recognize and observe this interplay that is the key to becoming a critical thinker and ultimately, a better physician. A doctor takes note of all symptoms and previous medical history before making an informed diagnosis, just like a knowledgeable reader takes into account the background of the author and the time period in which the text was written. We encourage readers to do their own dissection of any hobbies and topics that they are passionate about, and strengthen their analytical abilities in the process!"
