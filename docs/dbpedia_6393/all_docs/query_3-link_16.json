        "text": "Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nStarring Richard Widmark, Linda Darnell, Stephen McNally, Sidney Poitier\n\n* Published specifically for The Linda Darnell Centennial Blogathon hosted by Samantha at Musings of a Classic Film Addict . *\n\n¤¤¤\n\nMotion pictures are foremost presented to audiences as a form of entertainment. This was primarily the case during the Golden Age of Hollywood when the public sought diversion from trying times and bleak current events. Of course, film was also used to convey certain ideas – such as propaganda during periods of war/conflict – to mass amounts of people. It was and still is a powerful means of communication.\n\nThe art of film preservation has allowed modern moviegoers and film buffs the unique opportunity to view society as it was back in the day. To be fair, a movie set was not exactly a replica of ordinary, daily life. Certain elements, however, accurately reflected the overall trends of the period: language usage, hairstyles & dressing habits, eating habits, architecture, automotive models, and so on. In many ways, watching an older film is akin to studying a lesson in social history. We can learn about the past all the while understanding our present society.\n\nEvery year since 1989, the National Film Preservation Board has selected 25 films that are deemed to be “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant”. The oldest entry in the catalogue is Newark Athlete from 1891. Out of the estimated 500,000 films in existence, only 850 of them have been preserved in the national registry. This means that a huge number of deserving films have yet to be chosen, including 1950’s No Way Out, which is particularly baffling considering that Iron Man (2008) was inducted just last year. (Oh, do I wish I were joking.)\n\nAdapted and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, No Way Out is an incredibly moving story that deals with racism, deviancy, displacement, and urban violence. There can be lessons learned from watching it and the themes are as applicable in today’s world as they were 73 years ago. As a matter of fact, one can easily get unsettled by certain scenes that invoke (recent) current events.\n\n¤¤\n\nA call comes through to County Hospital about a shooting that occurred during the botched robbery of a gas station. The injured bandits arrive at the hospital shortly thereafter, both having been shot during the getaway. They are identified as the Biddle brothers, Ray (Richard Widmark) and Johnny. Ray is in stable condition with a gunshot wound to his leg but his brother is not so lucky. Johnny is conscious but completely unresponsive to any attempt of communication and treatment.\n\nDr. Luther Brooks (Sidney Poitier) has been assigned to replace another intern in the prison ward, leaving him with the responsibility of conducting a medical examination on the brothers. Brooks, who has just passed his State boards to become an M.D., is highly regarded and is also closely mentored by his superior, Dr. Wharton (Stephen McNally). Nonetheless, Ray Biddle refuses to be seen by Dr. Brooks – because he is Black.\n\nRay is the first to be examined by Dr. Brooks but begrudgingly so as he is openly racist and would prefer a White doctor. Unfazed by Ray’s bigotry, Dr. Brooks moves on to Johnny who is so out of it that he does not notice his cigarette, which was placed between his fingers by Ray, burning the palm of his hand. This particularly worries Dr. Brooks who instinctively believes Ray to have some sort of brain trauma. He decides to administer a spinal tap without the aid of a medic. Much to his dismay and to the horror of onlooker Ray, Johnny dies during the procedure.\n\nAlmost instantaneously, Ray accuses Dr. Brooks of murdering his brother. Since there were no other witnesses in the room, it is one man’s word against the other. Dr. Brooks insists that he did nothing wrong and demands an autopsy in order to prove his innocence, something which Ray outright refuses. Instead, Ray threatens Dr. Brooks’ life and that of his family. Luther tries to get the head of the hospital, Dr. Moreland, to force an autopsy but he refuses so as to not draw unnecessary attention.\n\nDr. Moreland: “I’m pro-Negro.”\n\nDr. Brooks: “I’m pro-good doctor: Black, White or polka dot.”\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Brooks is retained on the prison ward unit where the interactions between Ray and him become increasingly tense. With the aid of Dr. Wharton, he and Luther are able to locate Johnny’s widow, a Mrs. Edith Biddle (Linda Darnell). They hope that she will authorise the autopsy and clear Dr. Brooks’ good name.\n\n¤\n\nThis is the film that made lifelong friends out of Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier. They were over a decade apart in age and came from very different backgrounds but they did share one special common point: both had notable cinematic debuts. Their first roles were already proof enough of their extraordinary, often immeasurable, talent that would be shown time and time again throughout their 60+ years careers (each).\n\nDespite the tense subject matter at hand on No Way Out, the two were able to separate art from life. It was Widmark who was most upset about the on-screen clashing of Luther and Ray, which is something he brought up in 1992 at the ceremony in honour of Sidney’s AFI Lifetime Achievement Award. These guys were pure class.\n\nActor Stephen McNally was billed above Poitier although his character certainly takes a back seat to both Ray and Dr. Brooks. McNally does a fine job in his role and proves to be a sympathetic man although there is a certain amount of ambiguity to Dr. Wharton’s lifestyle. He has a large, nicely furnished house but there is no mention of a wife or companion. In fact, Wharton is largely dependent on his housekeeper, Gladys, to keep things up and running. At least he knows what a valuable person Gladys is and, in turn, thinks about her well-being. The scenes with Gladys, played by Amanda Rudolph, are gratifying because the character is very amicable with a gentle demeanour.\n\nThe most regrettable thing that I found about the film was that Dr. Brooks’ family did not have much screen time. His wife, Cora (Mildred Joanne Smith), was the only one who appeared in a couple of scenes. Not only that, she was the only Brooks’ family member who received screen credit for their appearance in the film. Then-newcomers Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, playing Luther’s brother and sister-in-law (presumably), as well as Amanda Rudolph were all uncredited. The woman who played Luther’s mother is not even listed amongst the cast. (This was not limited to the supporting Black cast, as there were several supporting White actors who also went unrecognised.)\n\n¤\n\nLinda Darnell’s offering\n\nLet me introduce you to Mrs. Edith Biddle. Well, that is not quite right. You see, “Edie” divorced Johnny Biddle over a year and a half ago and now goes by her maiden name, Johnson. Edie hails from Beaver Canal, a part of town predominantly made up of the poor, working class who have very limited prospects in life. Her family lived next door to the Biddles and their respective parents would get loaded every night. She now lives in a furnished room that is rather dumpy and in a sketchy part of town but that is an improvement from where she grew up.\n\nIt was a task for Dr. Wharton to track Edie down because she did not want to be found. Having left the Biddles and Beaver Canal for good, she decided to start over her life. She got a “respectable” gig as a carhop at a Drive-In which allows her to pay her own way. The way that she talks about her job makes it seem much more distinguished than it really is but to her, it is a major step up.\n\n“Yeah, I’ve come up in the world. I used to live in a sewer. Now I live in a swamp.” – Edie\n\nAs I watched Edie’s behaviour and listened to her story, I could not help but to compare her to Stella, the character Linda played in Fallen Angel (1945). Both women come from a background that can be classified as trailer trash. Stella’s father came from a long line of drunks and she grew up in a cheap boardinghouse that her mother ran. She came to Walton, a town on the California coast, to try to escape her past and get a better future. Unlike Edie, Stella wanted to marry a man who could provide her with financial and material security regardless of her true feelings for him. Edie, having already been married with certain complications (no spoiling!), could not be less interested in men. I liken Edie to how Stella would have turned out five years after the events in Fallen Angel. Of course, this is strictly fantasy speculation since Stella met an untimely demise in the film. (There was no way around that spoiler.)\n\nStella\n\nLinda had a knack for playing characters who exposed their rugged edges and tough attitudes. It was a way to create a thick outer shell so to protect their inner vulnerability. Both Edie and Stella were kind-at-heart but who openly growled at passerby. They sought a better way to live than the one they had to suffer as children, knowing that the only saving grace was self-perseverance. I would like to think that Edie would eventually bounce back from what happened during the timeline of No Way Out. There is some very subtle hinting that she and Dr. Wharton may have a spark and she certainly has a friend in Dr. Brooks. Edie has the chance to be redeemed in a way that was stolen from Stella.\n\n¤\n\nNo Way Out is a film that you can take you off-guard with its powerful messages and strong language. Joseph Mankiewicz was not afraid to bring elements of writer Lesser Samuel’s realistic narrative to the screenplay. Even 20th Century Fox head Darryl Zanuck was in agreement that this was a story that must be told even if it meant that certain cities would outright refuse to show the film. In the end, it did not topple the box office or win major awards. It was dismissed by some critics as being too low-budget and melodramatic; others praised it and applauded the effort from a Hollywood that rarely wanted to do the right thing “just because”. Surely this film has its chances to one day be inducted by the NFPB. It is too important of a film not to be.\n\nBehind-the-Scenes:\n\nIt would appear as if an alternate ending was shot for the film. These photos show action taking place in what I would wholeheartedly presume to be Dr. Wharton’s basement. However, that part of his house is never shown and instead this sequence was shot in Wharton’s living room area. I did read that initially the script had a decidedly different fate for Dr. Brooks, so perhaps this has to do with that fact.\n\n¤¤"
