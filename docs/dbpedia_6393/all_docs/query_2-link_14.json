        "text": "No Way Up? They should have called it Sharks on a Plane! If you watch the trailer for No Way Up, you get some hints of action, a dash of drama, and a heaping teaspoon of thrills. The finished product doesn’t match the recipe. Even a botched dish can still taste good, right? If you can bite around the burnt and crusty bits, you can still find some enjoyment in it. And that’s sort of the camp No Way Up falls into.\n\nIs No Way Up a bad movie? Definitely not. Does it deserve the heaps of one-star reviews on Letterboxd? Probably not. Does it have issues? Unquestionably. No Way Up falls under the category of films that shove all of the good parts into the trailer. The trailer does an excellent job of playing out most of the story beats, but unfortunately, that’s all that’s worth watching. If you give away the best parts of your film in a trailer, that’s fine. But not being able to pad the best parts with a few interesting ideas or storylines, then that’s when it becomes a problem.\n\nLet’s take a step back. No Way Up follows a group of “characters from different backgrounds” (their words, not mine), who find themselves in a peculiar predicament. The plane they were all on flies into a flock of birds, causing it to crash into the ocean. After sinking to the edge of a ravine, the survivors, who happen to be stuck in a small air pocket, must decide how to get out alive. Only one issue… there are sharks in the plane!\n\nFrom the description alone, No Way Up sounds like a banger of a film. In retrospect, it might have been better left as an idea. Flat acting, shallow (pun intended) characters, and lackluster action leave the viewer wishing they, too, were stuck at the bottom of the ocean. This idea feels original, has an exceptional trailer, and stars Colm Meaney—it should have been a home run.\n\nColm Meaney is the light at the end of the tunnel for this film; it’s a shame they wouldn’t let him speak in his natural accent. Within being on screen for just a few minutes, Always Sunny alumn Colm Meaney reveals his veteran [of insert war] status, turns out to be a bodyguard, and even does an ocular patdown after arriving at the airport! Let this man shine! As typical for A-listers who receive ‘and’ credits in films like these, No Way Up would go belly up without him. The first 15 to 20 minutes of this film are incredibly solid, even if the film tries to play itself up as a hijacker film during that time. And the final 10-ish minutes are fairly tense and effective. Everything in between that time is completely forgettable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I’d be remiss not to talk about the questionable music choices. The opening song is some pop punk song about climate change, and the credits song is just..whacky and out of place. That is all.\n\nI really wanted to like this film as it checks a bunch of boxes for me: disaster film, underwater horror, sharks, COLM MEANEY. It’s a shame there’s so much filler to extend the runtime to an unnecessary hour and a half. No Way Up could have shaved off 10 minutes and gone through a few more rounds of rewrites and maybe something good could have come out of it. Who knows. All I know is you can test the waters yourself and catch No Way Up on February 16th, 2024. Don’t forget your scuba gear.\n\nCards on the table, Alien: Romulus is really good. Great even. It’s a fun and fresh remixing of the series’ core elements, reviving the classic “haunted house in space” vibes that have been somewhat deadened by years of sequels full of lore. Lore that peeled the mystique of the Xenomorph away, and I’d go so far as to say Romulus brings some of that mysterious energy back, even for repeat customers of the series. For its quality, it lands high in my personal rankings, right below Alien 3 and right above Aliens (with Alien obviously in first place).\n\nI liked it a lot.\n\nBut I say this knowing that Alien: Romulus, respectfully, ends up performing an amalgam of the Alien franchise’s greatest hits towards its end. I’m left wondering: “Do I really love Alien: Romulus, or is it just the parts of Alien that it’s managed to replicate that I like? Do I love the memories? And is it wrong if it’s the latter?”\n\nAlien: Romulus hints at being the perfect bridge between Alien and Aliens in its first half, which is appropriate since it’s supposed to take place between them as a sort of side story. It follows a group of colonists, trying to escape their dead lives on a pitch-black planet by stealing technology from a derelict space station in orbit known as the Renaissance. Needless to say, it turns into a nightmare scenario, and there aren’t any colonial marines or space mercenaries here to step in and start shooting. This is that classic Alien horror where the search for a way out is much more important than the hunt for a weapon to beat the monster.\n\nBut this kind of flawless middle-point energy starts to fall apart when the vibes it sets up are supplanted by story beats and callbacks to the events of almost every other Alien film laced throughout the final act of the movie. The power of the franchise and its iconic scenes being referenced subsumes the back half of the film and makes it weaker than the first half. Which is an odd feeling because the first half is, genuinely, the closest we get to a true horror masterpiece like the original Alien. The tone is uncannily strong in its resemblance to the original films, while still managing to be something completely new.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriter-director Fede Alvarez’s venture into the world Ridley Scott dragged into existence kicking and screaming with slippery body horror and psychosexual H.R. Giger designs shows us one thing above all else: this man has a comprehensive, front-to-back, undeniable understanding of Alien. There’s a comprehension of the cyclical and back-breaking themes of worker oppression, and the violation of personhood that permeates the series. It shows a deep grasp, not just for the franchise but for its greater meaning and the greater horror it presents of having your autonomy stolen from you. And it’s all presented in the most gorgeous package imaginable.\n\nRomulus is on par with Aliens in terms of its technical innovations behind the scenes and packing the visual punch Cameron did with effects; it’s the best-looking film we’ve gotten since the original, with the environs of planetary orbit and the Renaissance being a perfect blend of brutalism and chunky analog tech that a lot of the other movies have left behind. It’s aesthetically bleak, even with the devastatingly beautiful views of space we get to glimpse, and both halves of the station have no comfort to offer its residents other than the knowledge of imminent chaos through its constant malfunctions.\n\nThis doesn’t mean Alvarez doesn’t have any fun with the material. He tosses in a few frantic, Sam Raimi homages into the mix, with the one I fell in love with being a scene I can only describe as “a perfectly executed Evil Dead sequence in space”. The effects that fill these ambitious scenes are full of perfectly blended CGI and practical SFX that ought to win Romulus an Oscar (if the Academy ever does the right thing and molts its dry, nasty, anti-horror cocoon it’s cooking in). If you haven’t learned how to fear face huggers all over again by the time this movie is over, I don’t know, you might need to check your pulse.\n\nAnd the ragtag crew of workers we’re given to experience the horror through is the perfect array of victims and heroes. Cailee Spaeny and Archie Renaux are great leads in this, pulling off a lot of very emotional moments and making some harrowing scenes so much scarier with their genuinely soul-crushing reactions. Spaeny’s tortured laborer turned even more tortured heroine, Rain, is a great successor in the Ellen Ripley badass dynasty. For me, she’s right up there with Lex from Alien vs Predator when it comes to loving her on-screen presence. And who would have expected Isabela Merced to be such a natural when it comes to navigating the scream queen terrain? My only complaint is Aileen Wu’s steady and steely pilot Navarro, the character that left me wanting more; not because she underperformed, but because she was so cool that I just wanted to straight up see more of her.\n\nBut if you’ve seen this film, you know there’s one actor who steals the show, and that is David Jonsson as Andy. When I say he has one of the best performances of the year locked in here, that he is one of my favorite characters in the entire series right up there next to Ripley and David, I mean it with my whole chest. Jonsson is sensational, he’s charismatic, he’s unbelievably skilled, and he has rendered some of the best physical acting I’ve seen on screen in a long time, not just in a horror movie, but bar none. If you see this movie for anything, let it be David Jonsson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while I can complain and say the film ends up playing the hits by its end, it’s not like it doesn’t do that well. I can prefer a less drawn-out ending, and less references to the newer films. I can wish they had pulled back with some of their line drops. And I can wish that they kept evoking that perfect feeling of the original film. But it certainly doesn’t make the great entry we have here irredeemable, and it’s certainly not going to stop me from watching it again (in true IMAX, if I can get to one). Alien: Romulus is a wonderful new addition to Alien’s canon, recognizing where it came from and hopefully marking the quality the series is returning to.\n\nThough it’s shorter than most of the films I’ve covered recently, Michael Varrati’s There’s A Zombie Outside is one of the more ambitious films I’ve seen this year, given its runtime and what it’s trying to tackle within it. That, and it’s coming from an independent source (shoutout, as always, we love our indie horror filmmakers). It’s new, it’s different, and it really nails its goal, or at the very least what I think its goal was: presenting the struggles of filmmaking and wrestling with how that art reflects you and your life. But it manages to do that in a very strange and very fun way.\n\nAdam’s birthday weekend getaway to a cabin in the woods isn’t what he envisioned. His friends are looking for something more scintillating to do. His boyfriend is looking for more quality time. And Adam is stuck, sleeping, watching old horror movies, and ruminating over his successes and failures. But when Adam sees a zombie outside the cabin, his mind becomes fractured as he starts to lose touch with reality, and ends up somewhere familiar—with safety nowhere to be found.\n\nI’ll be honest, I’m a bit close-minded to films that pitch themselves as meta-horror outright. However, the way Zombie Outside does meta-horror felt cool to watch because the film does a great job of disorienting you between the layers of reality and unreality presented in the film. Twenty minutes in, it hits you in the face with a wild punch you never see coming, and then follows it up for a one-two jab just minutes later when it gets even stranger. It’s a skillfully drafted narrative, and though sometimes it gets a little flat in telling its message with very straightforward dialogue, I enjoyed the story of Adam being haunted by the past and rapidly losing his grip on reality. I particularly enjoyed the dark comedy Varrati uses to address it.\n\nThe driving force that makes the story enjoyable is the cast, who all fit nicely in their roles. Adam is written well with some very relatable struggles that can get a bit too real, but it’s really thanks to Ben Baur’s great performance that that struggle comes to life. He plays especially well off of his partner Ollie, played by Ty Chen, whose brutal relationship issues make for a very uncomfortable scene that might have been my favorite part of the movie performance-wise.\n\nTaryn, played by Phylicia Wissa, is also fun as the voice of reason and stability in a movie where everything is going off the rails. She has some great line deliveries here that made me laugh pretty hard, and I would love to see her in more horror films going forward. She strikes me as a very slept-on player – along with Baur.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie’s biggest hindrance is its runtime, really. While engaging and paced pretty well, it barely clocks in at a tight 60 minutes, not including credits. I know I constantly complain on here about wanting movies to shave off some time, but Zombie Outside would definitely benefit from going a little longer.\n\nI wish we had gotten to see more of the over-the-top, truly insane layer of the film that is only really glimpsed at briefly; there’s an additional 30 minutes of b-movie somewhere out in the void where Varrati could get into a wild DeCoteau or Corman style 80’s creature feature to intersperse through the movie. The effects here are good, with the titular zombie’s makeup being some of the better monster prosthetics I’ve seen in a while; I was just hoping for that zombie to get more action than what we see in the film.\n\nThere’s a joke somewhere in here about that, but I can’t put my finger on it. I guess you’ll have to watch it to understand!\n\nHere’s to hoping the crew that worked on this can find a budget to make that a reality, because it really would be nice to see this film get expanded on somewhere down the line.\n\nThere’s A Zombie Outside is a very New Nightmare kind of venture into the rich inner worlds of misery we cultivate to make a name for ourselves. It’s a movie, about making a movie, that is in turn a movie about people making movies. It highlights how exhausting it can be to create a piece of art and be left wondering what happens next once it’s made. It, of course, also has a zombie. And if any of that piques your interest, it’s definitely worth the watch, so you should keep your eyes peeled for when this releases.\n\nAdvertisement"
