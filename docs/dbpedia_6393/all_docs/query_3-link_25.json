Nominated for the 1950 Oscar® for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay, this intense drama about racial hatred pulls no punches. When a white patient in a hospital dies under the care of a black intern (Sidney Poitier), the victim’s racist brother (Richard Widmark) seeks to destroy the doctor’s career. Although the hospital’s idealistic Chief Resident (Stephen McNally) tries to diffuse the escalating tension, the victim’s ex-wife (Linda Darnell) seems to go along with the vengeance-seeker—until she realizes she’s on the wrong side.",

        "text": "It’s an effective suspense drama that’s also one of the best treatments of race relations of its era, not preachy or pandering.\n\nMarch 28, 2022\n\nThe film is politically daring in its mere depiction of a Black protagonist—and in its view of a poor white man’s resentment of what he calls the preferential treatment of Black people.\n\nMarch 28, 2022\n\nIf you like your movies grim, you'll certainly enjoy this one. Personally, I don't think I want to see another \"problem\" film for a long while.\n\nJanuary 14, 2022\n\nDarryl F. Zanuck is to be congratulated for his intentions in making such a movie although his methods do leave something to be desired.\n\nSeptember 7, 2021\n\nI could not write any further in this review without citing the splendid and breath-taking dramatic work of Sidney Poitier.\n\nOctober 30, 2019\n\nThe violence of its climax is a bit too wild-eyed to sustain full belief in its sober message, but in other respects this is one of the best (and certainly the most plainspoken) of the films...\n\nOctober 18, 2019"
