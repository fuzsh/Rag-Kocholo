        "text": "If I were to reduce The Instigators to its main parts – Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, crime! – would I even need to tell you that this film is set in Boston? Some additional context: Rory (Damon) is an ex-marine whose finances and family life are in a bad place. Cobby (Affleck) is an ex-con who is in a similar position with the unhelpful addition that he has to be breathalysed every time he drives a vehicle. They are drawn together in a plan – along with rapper Jack Harlow (remember him?) – “masterminded” by local crook played by Michael Stuhlbarg (having a lot of fun when he’s not consoling a twinkly-eyed, broken-hearted Timothée Chalamet on the sofa!). I use quotation marks there, because everything goes wrong in this plan. This is, in fact, an entire movie dedicated to things going wrong.\n\nWe start off simply enough. Cobby, Rory and Scalvo (that would be Harlow’s character) are to rob an election night gala. Corrupt mayor Miccelli (Ron Perlman) is a dead cert to win, and his supporters will be turning up to the party with wads of cash for tickets and drinks. The only problem is that challenger candidate Mark Choi (Ronnie Cho) surges, and worse, the cash has been taken away by the time they get there. The plan quickly descends into disaster, at least one person is shot dead, and they manage to piss off the ruthless Miccelli in the process. For the next hour or so, Cobby and Rory are on the run from both the authorities and a political underbelly.\n\nThis is a tried-and-tested formula. No need to be too ambitious if you can do that well. And it certainly does not feel as though director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith) is trying to go for anything challenging here. The most out-of-the-ordinary thing is that Damon is paired with Casey not and Ben. And their chemistry is pretty good: Affleck has a smart ass schtick while Damon leans into the too-square-for-organised-crime thing. The script, from Chuck Maclean and Affleck, is pretty funny. In truth, there are some pretty diverting scenes early on as Rory and Cobby, hopelessly ill-equipped, blunder their way through the caper.\n\nBut it’s the introduction of Rory’s therapist, Donna (Hong Chau, last seen in Yorgos Lanthimos’ Kinds of Kindness and one of the most memorable parts of The Menu), into the action which proves indispensable. As soon as she joins in the chase – diagnosing Cobby and furthering Rory’s physical and emotional journey – there’s a lighter, sparkier repartee. In one of this film’s more ambitious sequences, the trio motor down a highway with two equally-weighted priorities: trying to change the song on the car radio and fleeing the police. It is here, as the group dynamic shifts between sniping and self-analysis that we reach a more intriguing film. And one that might have something to say: about our baggage and our hopes, our attempts to dispose of the former and pursue the latter. Certainly, it is a much more entertaining on-screen depiction of therapy – something I have had to endure so much I surely could practise as an actual shrink – than I have seen in any prestige television drama.\n\nUnfortunately, the script and genre conventions do not really allow the movie to process (see! I’ve picked up the lingo!) this dynamic. Towards the finishing line, the crashes become louder and the jokes, somehow, become broader. And so we are left with three very watchable actors, a few stand-out sequences, and some loud meandering. It will not lead you with any lingering trauma, but it does not exactly feel like a major breakthrough either.\n\n‘The Instigators’ is in select cinemas now, and streaming on Apple TV+ from 9 August"
