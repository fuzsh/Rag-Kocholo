        "text": "WHEN we last encountered César (Eduardo Noriega) -- the handsome, then nightmarishly disfigured, then surgically restored protagonist of the sexy 1997 Spanish psychological puzzler ''Open Your Eyes'' (''Abre los Ojos'') -- he was either dead, dreaming or about to awaken from a virtual-reality coma in which his true love, played by that sultry toothpick Penélope Cruz, might or might not have been a figment of his imagination. ''Abre los ojos,'' commands a woman's voice. What will César look like when he next opens his eyes?\n\nTom Cruise, actually. Well, his name will be David Ames, he'll speak English instead of Spanish and he'll be living in Los Angeles. But he'll still be chasing Penélope Cruz, he'll still be disfigured in a car accident and he'll still come to wonder if his life is a dream. César will have undergone a transplant more perilous than any organ replacement: he'll have been wrenched from an artistically and commercially successful European film and plunked down into the strange new world of megabudget Hollywood-studio remakes. This way lie the battered husks of la femme Nikita, Martin Guerre and the heroes of ''The Vanishing,'' ''Nightwatch'' and ''Wings of Desire,'' among many others. Few complex characters have come through this journey with their souls intact.\n\n''Vanilla Sky'' is the name of this latest remake, and with Mr. Cruise on board, along with Ms. Cruz, Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell, it's one of the holiday season's most enticing prospects. (It opens on Dec. 14.) The part is certainly a plum one for Mr. Cruise, who first gets to bask in his movie-star glamour and sexual potency and then to sport a pathetic-freak makeup job -- sure-fire Oscar bait. What remains to be seen is if the writer and director, the cheerfully down-to-earth Cameron Crowe (''Jerry Maguire,'' ''Almost Famous''), will be able to straddle the eerie border between fantasy and reality that his Spanish predecessor, Alejandro Amenábar, occupies as if by birthright.\n\nMr. Amenábar didn't come aboard for ''Vanilla Sky.'' Perhaps that was because Mr. Cruise had hired him to direct his wife at the time, Nicole Kidman, in the summer's arty spook-show hit, ''The Others.'' But I'd like to think that even if he hadn't been otherwise engaged, Mr. Amenábar would have been savvy enough to sell the rights to his story for a heap of money and then run like crazy in the other direction. He didn't need to revisit material he had thoroughly explored -- especially in the company of image-obsessed movie stars, obtuse studio executives and platoons of marketing people eager to try out sundry endings on fickle test audiences.\n\nIt would be terrific to report that Hollywood does not, contrary to popular belief, have a coarsening effect on the foreign properties it remakes. Terrific, but wrong. In this area as in few others, studios live up to their reputation as titanic forces of philistinism. Remakes don't, from the outset, attract artistic adventurers. Victor Drai, the producer who in the 80's turned the dim French comedy ''Pardon Mon Affaire'' into the even dimmer ''The Woman in Red,'' and ''The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe'' into the frightful ''The Man With One Red Shoe,'' explained at the time why selling a foreign film to Hollywood executives makes for an easy day's work: ''With a book,'' he said, ''you have to tell them what kind of picture it will make. With a movie, you just show them.''\n\nA successful American screenwriter -- currently adapting a Hong Kong action picture -- was even more explicit. ''I don't have much wisdom to offer beyond this one deep insight,'' he said. ''It's a whole lot easier to borrow a story than to think up your own.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
