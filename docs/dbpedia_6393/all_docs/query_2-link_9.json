        "text": "There's nothing Hollywood likes more than a proven formula. If a story worked once, there's no reason it shouldn't work again — hence, the industry's love affair with remakes. This extends in particular to foreign films, which tend to be relegated to art houses. If a film from another country has earned critical acclaim and/or performed well at the worldwide box office, Hollywood would rather put its own spin on the material than let the original artists gain a foothold in the U.S. market. Predictably, this has often led to disaster. Sometimes a film's brilliance gets lost in translation; other times, studios just completely misunderstand what made the first film great.\n\n9 of 25\n\n\"The Wicker Man\"\n\nGetty Images\n\n“Not the bees!” Neil LaBute torched whatever remained of his reputation with this unintentional howler. Robin Hardy’s original is an inimitable mixture of eerie Celtic mood and pulp detective fiction; it’s also a cult film with a small but dedicated following that had zero interest in an Americanized version of a beloved classic. That “The Wicker Man” bombed wasn’t surprising. That it was a full-tilt disaster with a singularly unhinged performance from Nicolas Cage at least gave it a second lease on life as a so-bad-it’s-kinda-brilliant oddity. It’s a pretty dull movie overall, but you do get to see Cage wreck shop in a bear suit, which ain’t poverty.\n\n10 of 25\n\n\"Nightwatch\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nDanish filmmaker Ole Bornedal pulled a Sluizer by going Hollywood and mucking up his nifty 1994 thriller about a college student who gets embroiled in a serial killer investigation while working as a night watchman at a morgue. You might be tempted to check out the remake due to its stellar cast (Ewan McGregor, Nick Nolte, Patricia Arquette, Lauren Graham and Josh Brolin) and Steven Soderbergh pedigree, but keep in mind that the director was two years out from revitalizing his career with “Out of Sight” and needed the screenwriting work (of which he was not proud). There’s nothing here.\n\n11 of 25\n\n\"And God Created Woman\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nRoger Vadim tried and failed to cash in on the title of his 1956 sensation that launched Brigitte Bardot into superstardom with this top-down reworking starring Rebecca De Mornay. The films are completely different, but at least the original movie has a chintzy ‘50s allure and a ready-to-explode Bardot. The 1988 version stars De Mornay as an escaped prisoner who finds herself caught up in political campaign of a New Mexico governor hopeful played by Frank Langella. Vadim had completely lost his fastball by this point — not that he was much of a director to begin with.\n\n12 of 25\n\n\"Blame It on Rio\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nOnce was more than enough with this ultra-creepy sex comedy about two 40-year-old men going on vacation with their comely teenage daughters, but Hollywood found it necessary to take a crack with no less than Stanley “Singin’ in the Rain” Donen at the helm. The film felt like a bad idea at the time and plays like a criminal act today. Michael Caine gets it on with the 17-year-old daughter (Michelle Johnson) of his best friend (Joseph Bologna) on the beach, kicking off the one of the most disturbing farces you’re ever going to see.\n\n16 of 25\n\n\"The Toy\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nIf you’re remaking a French comedy about a spoiled white brat who convinces his wealthy white father to hire a personal adult playmate, you might not want to cast a black actor as the exploited party. And yet. Richard Donner’s one of our most socially conscientious directors (he made white South Africans the bad guys in “Lethal Weapon 2” after all), but he did Richard Pryor dirty by having him find common cause with a neglected white kid (Scott Schwartz) who despises his racist Southern father (Jackie Gleason). Donner’s trying to make a film about tolerance, but the material is too thin.\n\n25 of 25\n\n\"Delivery Man\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nFrench-Canadian filmmaker Ken Scott went Hollywood with a remake of his comedy “Starbuck,\" in which a debt-ridden man discovers his prolific sperm donations resulted in the siring of over 500 children. Vince Vaughn stars as the remarkably fertile main character, who, after learning the identities of the children, endeavors to make a small but positive influence on each of their lives. What’s intended to be heartwarming comes off as incredibly creepy. The final scene, where his hundreds of children visit him in the maternity ward where his wife has just given birth, is jaw-droppingly awful."
