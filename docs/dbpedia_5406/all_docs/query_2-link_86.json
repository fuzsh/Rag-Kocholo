        "text": "The comparative report is based on the five national reports drafted as part of the research project “Handle with care: Assessing and designing methods for evaluation and development of the quality of justice”: namely, the Finnish, French, Hungarian, Italian, and Dutch National Reports. One of the project’s aims is to identify national practices that could be implemented in other countries in order to improve the quality of the services provided by courts. For that reason, we had to understand what kind of practices exist and what kind of innovative practices were emerging. Five countries were chosen to represent an interesting sample. This report uses the findings of the national reports to identify trends in national approaches and experiences in evaluating and promoting justice quality. It does not seek to assess or evaluate each national system comprehensively; the data collected at national level in each of the five countries are compared to identify common trends and diverging...\n\nThis paper raises some methodological issues when a comparative approach is used to compare the number of judges, court personnel, and court performance in European judiciaries. Data come from the Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) of the Council of Europe, which also is the main source for the European Union Justice Scoreboard. Some proposals are made to improve the collection of data and, then, increasing their comparability. The paper shows how an assessment on the number of judges and court personnel can benefit from a cross country comparative perspective, but only if quantitative analysis come together with in-depth qualitative studies. Este articulo plantea algunos problemas metodologicos que surgen cuando se abordan desde una perspectiva comparativa el numero de jueces, el personal judicial y la actuacion judicial en diferentes ambitos judiciales europeos. Los datos provienen de la Comision Europea para la Eficacia de la Justicia (CEPEJ, en ingles), del Consejo...\n\nThe empirical study focuses on the quality-assurance system of administration of justice. The key findings are as follow: The governance of the Hungarian judiciary is highly centralized. The advantage of this situation is that the central administration has been able and has done very effective steps to improve the timeliness of the adjudication, to reduce backlogs and to balance the disproportionate workload between courts and between judges of a court These steps rather quantity-orientated but there are signs of monitoring the quality of judicial work (by publishing appeal and quash rates by courts and putting emphasis on soft judicial skills in the process of selection and evaluation of judges) The disadvantage of this governance model is that judges feel pressure to please their immediate superiors who evaluate them and decide on their career within the judiciary (that can be a threat to autonomous decision-making). Bottom-up initiatives are relatively rare in the hierarchical s...\n\nBased on empirical methodology, this study is an attempt at providing a quality level assessment of the Hungarian judicature. Since the 1990 regime change two major justice reforms have taken place aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of justice. The reform of 1997 dramatically transforming the judicial hierarchy system, court management and the procedural framework was carried out under the auspices of EU accession and attempted to improve the quality of justice following explicitly European examples. In this spirit, a central administrative body was established (the National Judicial Council), which played a crucial role in the matter of improving the quality of justice. The Orbán Government that came to power in 2010 carried out a reform as an EU Member State that triggered harsh criticism from international organizations as well as EU institutions. With prioritizing quality and efficiency aspects, the elements of the reform that brought about objections from those havin..."
