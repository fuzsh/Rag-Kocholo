        "text": "GT3X+ accelerometer placement affects the reliability of step-counts measured during running and pedal-revolution counts measured during bicycling.\n\nPubMed\n\nGatti, Anthony A; Stratford, Paul W; Brenneman, Elora C; Maly, Monica R\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAccelerometers provide a measure of step-count. Reliability and validity of step-count and pedal-revolution count measurements by the GT3X+ accelerometer, placed at different anatomical locations, is absent in the literature. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability and validity of step and pedal-revolution counts produced by the GT3X+ placed at different anatomical locations during running and bicycling. Twenty-two healthy adults (14 men and 8 women) completed running and bicycling activity bouts (5 minutes each) while wearing 6 accelerometers: 2 each at the waist, thigh and shank. Accelerometer and video data were collected during activity. Excellent reliability and validity were found for measurements taken from accelerometers mounted at the waist and shank during running (Reliability: intraclass correlation (ICC) â¥ 0.99; standard error of measurement (SEM) â¤1.0 steps; Pearson â¥ 0.99) and at the thigh and shank during bicycling (Reliability: ICC â¥ 0.99; SEM â¤1.0 revolutions; Pearson â¥ 0.99). Excellent reliability was found between measurements taken at the waist and shank during running (ICC â¥ 0.98; SEM â¤1.6 steps) and between measurements taken at the thigh and shank during bicycling (ICC â¥ 0.99; SEM â¤1.0 revolutions). These data suggest that the GT3X+ can be used for measuring step-count during running and pedal-revolution count during bicycling. Only shank placement is recommended for both activities.\n\nAccuracy of piezoelectric pedometer and accelerometer step counts.\n\nPubMed\n\nCruz, Joana; Brooks, Dina; Marques, Alda\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis study aimed to assess step-count accuracy of a piezoeletric pedometer (Yamax PW/EX-510), when worn at different body parts, and a triaxial accelerometer (GT3X+), and to compare device accuracy; and identify the preferred location(s) to wear a pedometer. Sixty-three healthy adults (45.8Â±20.6 years old) wore 7 pedometers (neck, lateral right and left of the waist, front right and left of the waist, front pockets of the trousers) and 1 accelerometer (over the right hip), while walking 120 m at slow, self-preferred/normal and fast paces. Steps were recorded. Participants identified their preferred location(s) to wear the pedometer. Absolute percent error (APE) and Bland and Altman (BA) method were used to assess device accuracy (criterion measure: manual counts) and BA method for device comparisons. Pedometer APE was below 3% at normal and fast paces despite wearing location, but higher at slow pace (4.5-9.1%). Pedometers were more accurate at the front waist and inside the pockets. Accelerometer APE was higher than pedometer APE (P<0.05); nevertheless, limits of agreement between devices were relatively small. Preferred wearing locations were inside the front right (N.=25) and left (N.=20) pockets of the trousers. Yamax PW/EX-510 pedometers may be preferable than GT3X+ accelerometers to count steps, as they provide more accurate results. These pedometers should be worn at the front right or left positions of the waist or inside the front pockets of the trousers.\n\nAgreement between pedometer and accelerometer in measuring physical activity in overweight and obese pregnant women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKinnunen, Tarja I; Tennant, Peter W G; McParlin, Catherine; Poston, Lucilla; Robson, Stephen C; Bell, Ruth\n\n2011-06-27\n\nInexpensive, reliable objective methods are needed to measure physical activity (PA) in large scale trials. This study compared the number of pedometer step counts with accelerometer data in pregnant women in free-living conditions to assess agreement between these measures. Pregnant women (n = 58) with body mass index â¥25 kg/m(2) at median 13 weeks' gestation wore a GT1M Actigraph accelerometer and a Yamax Digi-Walker CW-701 pedometer for four consecutive days. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were determined between pedometer step counts and various accelerometer measures of PA. Total agreement between accelerometer and pedometer step counts was evaluated by determining the 95% limits of agreement estimated using a regression-based method. Agreement between the monitors in categorising participants as active or inactive was assessed by determining Kappa. Pedometer step counts correlated moderately (r = 0.36 to 0.54) with most accelerometer measures of PA. Overall step counts recorded by the pedometer and the accelerometer were not significantly different (medians 5961 vs. 5687 steps/day, p = 0.37). However, the 95% limits of agreement ranged from -2690 to 2656 steps/day for the mean step count value (6026 steps/day) and changed substantially over the range of values. Agreement between the monitors in categorising participants to active and inactive varied from moderate to good depending on the criteria adopted. Despite statistically significant correlations and similar median step counts, the overall agreement between pedometer and accelerometer step counts was poor and varied with activity level. Pedometer and accelerometer steps cannot be used interchangeably in overweight and obese pregnant women.\n\nAgreement between pedometer and accelerometer in measuring physical activity in overweight and obese pregnant women\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Inexpensive, reliable objective methods are needed to measure physical activity (PA) in large scale trials.

Nineteen boys (age: 9.5 +/- 0.8 yr) and 15 men (age: 20.7 +/- 1.4 yr) walked and ran on a treadmill, kicked a ball to and fro, played hopscotch, and sat quietly. An RT3 was worn on the right hip; boys also wore a Tritrac on the left hip. Oxygen consumption was expressed as a ratio of body mass raised to the power of 0.75 (S VO2). RT3 counts correlated significantly with S VO2 in boys (r = 0.87, P < 0.01) and men (r = 0.85, P < 0.01). However, during treadmill activities, RT3 counts were significantly higher for boys (P < 0.05). RT3 counts corresponding to \"moderate\" and \"vigorous\" activity were similar for boys and men for all activities (moderate = 970.2 for boys and 984.0 for men; vigorous = 2333.0 for boys and 2340.8 for men) but approximately 400 counts lower in men when only treadmill activities were considered. Tritrac counts correlated significantly with S VO2 in boys (r = 0.87, P < 0.01), but were significantly lower than RT3 counts across most activities (P < 0.05). The RT3 accelerometer is a good measure of physical activity for boys and men. However, moderate and vigorous intensity count thresholds differ for boys and men when the predominant activities are walking and running. RT3 counts are significantly higher than Tritrac counts for a number of activities. These findings have implications when comparing activity counts between studies using the different instruments.\n\nPhysical activity and sedentary behavior during pregnancy and postpartum, measured using hip and wrist-worn accelerometers.\n\nPubMed\n\nHesketh, Kathryn R; Evenson, Kelly R; Stroo, Marissa; Clancy, Shayna M; Ãstbye, Truls; Benjamin-Neelon, Sara E\n\n2018-06-01\n\nPhysical activity in pregnancy and postpartum is beneficial to mothers and infants. To advance knowledge of objective physical activity measurement during these periods, this study compares hip to wrist accelerometer compliance; assesses convergent validity (correlation) between hip- and wrist-worn accelerometry; and assesses change in physical activity from pregnancy to postpartum. We recruited women during pregnancy ( n â¯=â¯100; 2014-2015), asking them to wear hip and wrist accelerometers for 7â¯days during Trimester 2 (T2), Trimester 3 (T3), and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months postpartum. We assessed average wear-time and correlations (axis-specific counts/minute, vector magnitude counts/day and step counts/day) at T2, T3, and postpartum. Compliance was higher for wrist-worn accelerometers. Hip and wrist accelerometers showed moderate to high correlations (Pearson's r 0.59 to 0.84). Hip-measured sedentary and active time differed little between T2 and T3. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity decreased at T3 and remained low postpartum. Light physical activity increased and sedentary time decreased throughout the postpartum period. Wrist accelerometers may be preferable during pregnancy and appear comparable to hip accelerometers. As physical activity declines during later pregnancy and may not rebound post birth, support for re-engaging in physical activity earlier in the postpartum period may benefit women.\n\nReproducibility of Accelerometer-Assessed Physical Activity and Sedentary Time.\n\nPubMed\n\nKeadle, Sarah Kozey; Shiroma, Eric J; Kamada, Masamitsu; Matthews, Charles E; Harris, Tamara B; Lee, I-Min\n\n2017-04-01\n\nAccelerometers are used increasingly in large epidemiologic studies, but, given logistic and cost constraints, most studies are restricted to a single, 7-day accelerometer monitoring period. It is unknown how well a 7-day accelerometer monitoring period estimates longer-term patterns of behavior, which is critical for interpreting, and potentially improving, disease risk estimates in etiologic studies. A subset of participants from the Women's Health Study (N=209; mean age, 70.6 [SD=5.7] years) completed at least two 7-day accelerometer administrations (ActiGraph GT3X+) within a period of 2-3 years. Monitor output was translated into total counts, steps, and time spent in sedentary, light-intensity, and moderate to vigorous-intensity activity (MVPA) and bouted-MVPA (i.e., 10-minute bouts). For each metric, intraclass correlations (ICCs) and 95% CIs were calculated using linear-mixed models and adjusted for wear time, age, BMI, and season. The data were collected in 2011-2015 and analyzed in 2015-2016. The ICCs ranged from 0.67 (95% CI=0.60, 0.73) for bouted-MVPA to 0.82 (95% CI=0.77, 0.85) for total daily counts and were similar across age, BMI, and for less and more active women. For all metrics, classification accuracy within 1 quartile was >90%. These data provide reassurance that a 7-day accelerometer-assessment protocol provides a reproducible (and practical) measure of physical activity and sedentary time. However, ICCs varied by metric; therefore, future prospective studies of chronic diseases might benefit from existing methods to adjust risk estimates for within-person variability in activity to get a better estimate of the true strength of association.

Accelerometers measure acceleration multiple times within a given frequency and summarize this as a count over a pre-specified time period or epoch. The resultant count represents acceleration over the epoch length. Accelerometers eliminate biasesâ¦\n\nA comprehensive comparison of simple step counting techniques using wrist- and ankle-mounted accelerometer and gyroscope signals.\n\nPubMed\n\nRhudy, Matthew B; Mahoney, Joseph M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe goal of this work is to compare the differences between various step counting algorithms using both accelerometer and gyroscope measurements from wrist and ankle-mounted sensors. Participants completed four different conditions on a treadmill while wearing an accelerometer and gyroscope on the wrist and the ankle. Three different step counting techniques were applied to the data from each sensor type and mounting location. It was determined that using gyroscope measurements allowed for better performance than the typically used accelerometers, and that ankle-mounted sensors provided better performance than those mounted on the wrist.\n\nValidation of three short physical activity questionnaires with accelerometers among university students in Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrÃ­guez-MuÃ±oz, Sheila; Corella, Cristina; Abarca-Sos, Alberto; Zaragoza, Javier\n\n2017-12-01\n\nPhysical activity (PA) in university students has not been analyzed with specific questionnaires tailored to this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the validity of three PA questionnaires developed on other populations comparing with accelerometer values: counts and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) calculated with uniaxial and triaxial cut points. One hundred and forty-five university students (of whom, 92 women) from Spain wore an accelerometer GT3X or GTX+ to collect PA data of 7 full days. Three questionnaires, Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adults (PAQ-AD), Assessment of Physical Activity Questionnaire (APALQ), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) were administrated jointly with the collection of accelerometer values. Finally, after the application of inclusion criteria, data from 95 participants (62 women) with a mean age of 21.96Â±2.33 years were analyzed to compare the instruments measures. The correlational analysis showed that PAQ-AD (0.44-0.56) and IPAQ-SF (0.26-0.69) questionnaires were significantly related to accelerometers scores: counts, uniaxial MVPA and triaxial MVPA. Conversely, APALQ displayed no significant relations for males with accelerometers scores for MVPA created with both cut points. PAQ-AD and IPAQ-SF questionnaires have shown adequate validity to use with Spanish university students. The use of counts to validate self-report data in order to reduce the variability display by MVPA created with different cut points is discussed. Finally, validated instruments to measure PA in university students will allow implementation of strategies for PA promotion based on reliable data.\n\nPhysical activity classification using the GENEA wrist-worn accelerometer.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Shaoyan; Rowlands, Alex V; Murray, Peter; Hurst, Tina L\n\n2012-04-01\n\nMost accelerometer-based activity monitors are worn on the waist or lower back for assessment of habitual physical activity. Output is in arbitrary counts that can be classified by activity intensity according to published thresholds. The purpose of this study was to develop methods to classify physical activities into walking, running, household, or sedentary activities based on raw acceleration data from the GENEA (Gravity Estimator of Normal Everyday Activity) and compare classification accuracy from a wrist-worn GENEA with a waist-worn GENEA. Sixty participants (age = 49.4 Â± 6.5 yr, body mass index = 24.6 Â± 3.4 kgÂ·mâ»Â²) completed an ordered series of 10-12 semistructured activities in the laboratory and outdoor environment. Throughout, three GENEA accelerometers were worn: one at the waist, one on the left wrist, and one on the right wrist. Acceleration data were collected at 80 Hz. Features obtained from both fast Fourier transform and wavelet decomposition were extracted, and machine learning algorithms were used to classify four types of daily activities including sedentary, household, walking, and running activities. The computational results demonstrated that the algorithm we developed can accurately classify certain types of daily activities, with high overall classification accuracy for both waist-worn GENEA (0.99) and wrist-worn GENEA (right wrist = 0.97, left wrist = 0.96). We have successfully developed algorithms suitable for use with wrist-worn accelerometers for detecting certain types of physical activities; the performance is comparable to waist-worn accelerometers for assessment of physical activity.\n\nAccelerometer-measured sedentary behaviour and physical activity of inpatients with severe mental illness.\n\nPubMed\n\nKruisdijk, Frank; Deenik, Jeroen; Tenback, Diederik; Tak, Erwin; Beekman, Aart-Jan; van Harten, Peter; Hopman-Rock, Marijke; Hendriksen, Ingrid\n\n2017-08-01\n\nSedentary behaviour and lack of physical activity threatens health. Research concerning these behaviours of inpatients with severe mental illness is limited but urgently needed to reveal prevalence and magnitude. In total, 184 inpatients (men n =108, women n =76, mean age 57,4, 20% first generation antipsychotics, 40% second generation antipsychotics, 43% antidepressants, mean years hospitalisation 13 years), with severe mental illness of a Dutch psychiatric hospital wore an accelerometer for five days to objectively measure total activity counts per hour and percentages in sedentary behaviour, light intensity physical activity and moderate to vigorous physical activity. Accelerometer data were compared with data of 54 healthy ward employees. Patients showed significantly less activity counts per hour compared to employees (p=0.02), although the differences were small (d=0.32). Patients were sedentary during 84% of the wear time (50min/h), spend 10% in light intensity physical activity and 6% in moderate to vigorous physical activity. Age was the only significant predictor, predicting less total activity counts/h in higher ages. Decreasing sedentary behaviour and improving physical activity in this population should be a high priority in clinical practice. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A vital step in PA measurement is the classification of daily time into accelerometer wear and nonwear intervals using its recordings (counts) and an accelerometer-specific algorithm. the purpose of this study was to validate and improve a commonly used algorithm for classifying accelerometer wear and nonwear time intervals using objective movement data obtained in the whole-room indirect calorimeter. we conducted a validation study of a wear or nonwear automatic algorithm using data obtained from 49 adults and 76 youth wearing accelerometers during a strictly monitored 24-h stay in a room calorimeter. The accelerometer wear and nonwear time classified by the algorithm was compared with actual wearing time. Potential improvements to the algorithm were examined using the minimum classification error as an optimization target. the recommended elements in the new algorithm are as follows: 1) zero-count threshold during a nonwear time interval, 2) 90-min time window for consecutive zero or nonzero counts, and 3) allowance of 2-min interval of nonzero counts with the upstream or downstream 30-min consecutive zero-count window for detection of artifactual movements. Compared with the true wearing status, improvements to the algorithm decreased nonwear time misclassification during the waking and the 24-h periods (all P values < 0.001). the accelerometer wear or nonwear time algorithm improvements may lead to more accurate estimation of time spent in sedentary and active behaviors.\n\nPrediction of activity-related energy expenditure using accelerometer-derived physical activity under free-living conditions: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeran, S; Steinbrecher, A; Pischon, T\n\n2016-08-01\n\nActivity-related energy expenditure (AEE) might be an important factor in the etiology of chronic diseases. However, measurement of free-living AEE is usually not feasible in large-scale epidemiological studies but instead has traditionally been estimated based on self-reported physical activity. Recently, accelerometry has been proposed for objective assessment of physical activity, but it is unclear to what extent this methods explains the variance in AEE. We conducted a systematic review searching MEDLINE database (until 2014) on studies that estimated AEE based on accelerometry-assessed physical activity in adults under free-living conditions (using doubly labeled water method). Extracted study characteristics were sample size, accelerometer (type (uniaxial, triaxial), metrics (for example, activity counts, steps, acceleration), recording period, body position, wear time), explained variance of AEE (R(2)) and number of additional predictors. The relation of univariate and multivariate R(2) with study characteristics was analyzed using nonparametric tests. Nineteen articles were identified. Examination of various accelerometers or subpopulations in one article was treated separately, resulting in 28 studies. Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 149. In most studies the accelerometer was triaxial, worn at the trunk, during waking hours and reported activity counts as output metric. Recording periods ranged from 5 to 15 days. The variance of AEE explained by accelerometer-assessed physical activity ranged from 4 to 80% (median crude R(2)=26%). Sample size was inversely related to the explained variance. Inclusion of 1 to 3 other predictors in addition to accelerometer output significantly increased the explained variance to a range of 12.5-86% (median total R(2)=41%). The increase did not depend on the number of added predictors. We conclude that there is large heterogeneity across studies in the explained variance of AEE when estimated based on accelerometry. Thus\n\nCalibration and comparison of accelerometer cut points in preschool children.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Cauwenberghe, Eveline; Labarque, Valery; Trost, Stewart G; de Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse; Cardon, Greet\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThe present study aimed to develop accelerometer cut points to classify physical activities (PA) by intensity in preschoolers and to investigate discrepancies in PA levels when applying various accelerometer cut points. To calibrate the accelerometer, 18 preschoolers (5.8 Â± 0.4 years) performed eleven structured activities and one free play session while wearing a GT1M ActiGraph accelerometer using 15 s epochs. The structured activities were chosen based on the direct observation system Children's Activity Rating Scale (CARS) while the criterion measure of PA intensity during free play was provided using a second-by-second observation protocol (modified CARS). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to determine the accelerometer cut points. To examine the classification differences, accelerometer data of four consecutive days from 114 preschoolers (5.5 Â± 0.3 years) were classified by intensity according to previously published and the newly developed accelerometer cut points. Differences in predicted PA levels were evaluated using repeated measures ANOVA and Chi Square test. Cut points were identified at 373 counts/15 s for light (sensitivity: 86%; specificity: 91%; Area under ROC curve: 0.95), 585 counts/15 s for moderate (87%; 82%; 0.91) and 881 counts/15 s for vigorous PA (88%; 91%; 0.94). Further, applying various accelerometer cut points to the same data resulted in statistically and biologically significant differences in PA. Accelerometer cut points were developed with good discriminatory power for differentiating between PA levels in preschoolers and the choice of accelerometer cut points can result in large discrepancies.\n\nConcurrent validation of the Actigraph gt3x+, Polar Active accelerometer, Omron HJ-720 and Yamax Digiwalker SW-701 pedometer step counts in lab-based and free-living settings.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Joey A; Williams, Skip M; Brown, Dale D; Laurson, Kelly R\n\n2015-01-01\n\nActivity monitors are frequently used to assess activity in many settings. But as technology advances, so do the mechanisms used to estimate activity causing a continuous need to validate newly developed monitors. The purpose of this study was to examine the step count validity of the Yamax Digiwalker SW-701 pedometer (YX), Omron HJ-720Â T pedometer (OP), Polar Active accelerometer (PAC) and Actigraph gt3x+ accelerometer (AG) under controlled and free-living conditions. Participants completed five stages of treadmill walking (nÂ =Â 43) and a subset of these completed a 3-day free-living wear period (nÂ =Â 37). Manually counted (MC) steps provided a criterion measure for treadmill walking, whereas the comparative measure during free-living was the YX. During treadmill walking, the OP was the most accurate monitor across all speeds (Â±1.1% of MC steps), while the PAC underestimated steps by 6.7-16.0% per stage. During free-living, the OP and AG counted 97.5% and 98.5% of YX steps, respectively. The PAC overestimated steps by 44.0%, or 5,265 steps per day. The Omron pedometer seems to provide the most reliable and valid estimate of steps taken, as it was the best performer under lab-based conditions and provided comparable results to the YX in free-living. Future studies should consider these monitors in additional populations and settings.\n\nThe impact of accelerometer wear location on the relationship between step counts and arterial stiffness in adults treated for hypertension and diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nCooke, Alexandra B; Daskalopoulou, Stella S; Dasgupta, Kaberi\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAccelerometer placement at the wrist is convenient and increasingly adopted despite less accurate physical activity (PA) measurement than with waist placement. Capitalizing on a study that started with wrist placement and shifted to waist placement, we compared associations between PA measures derived from different accelerometer locations with a responsive arterial health indicator, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Cross-sectional study. We previously demonstrated an inverse association between waist-worn pedometer-assessed step counts (Yamax SW-200, 7 days) and cfPWV (-0.20m/s, 95% CI -0.28, -0.12 per 1000 step/day increment) in 366 adults. Participants concurrently wore accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3X+), most at the waist but the first 46 at the wrist. We matched this subgroup with participants from the 'waist accelerometer' group (sex, age, and pedometer-assessed steps/day) and assessed associations with cfPWV (applanation tonometry, Sphygmocor) separately in each subgroup through linear regression models. Compared to the waist group, wrist group participants had higher step counts (mean difference 3980 steps/day; 95% CI 2517, 5443), energy expenditure (967kcal/day, 95% CI 755, 1179), and moderate-to-vigorous-PA (138min; 95% CI 114, 162). Accelerometer-assessed step counts (waist) suggested an association with cfPWV (-0.28m/s, 95% CI -0.58, 0.01); but no relationship was apparent with wrist-assessed steps (0.02m/s, 95% CI -0.24, 0.27). Waist but not wrist ActiGraph PA measures signal associations between PA and cfPWV. We urge researchers to consider the importance of wear location choice on relationships with health indicators.

These rich data not only provide opportunities to improve PA characterisation, but also bring logistical and analytic challenges. We discuss how researchers and developers from multiple disciplines are responding to the analytic challenges and how advances in data storage, transmission and big data computing will minimise logistical challenges. These new approaches also bring the need for several paradigm shifts for PA researchers, including a shift from count-based approaches and regression calibrations for PA energy expenditure (PAEE) estimation to activity characterisation and EE estimation based on features extracted from raw acceleration signals. Furthermore, a collaborative approach towards analytic methods is proposed to facilitate PA research, which requires a shift away from multiple independent calibration studies. Finally, we make the case for a distinction between PA represented by accelerometer-based devices and PA assessed by self-report. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Data came from 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) for 2174 youth ages 12 to 19. Biomarkers were: body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), BMI percentile, height and waist circumference (WC, cm), triceps and subscapular skinfolds (mm), systolic & diastolic blood pressure (BP, mmHg), high-density lipoprotein (HDL, mg/dL), total cholesterol (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL), insulin (Î¼U/ml), C-reactive protein (mg/dL), and glycohemoglobin (%). In separate sex-stratified models, each biomarker was regressed on accelerometer variables [mean MVPA (min/day), nonsedentary counts, and MVPA bouts (mean min/day)] and self-reported MVPA. Covariates were age, race/ethnicity, SES, physical limitations, and asthma. In boys, correlations between self-report and accelerometer MVPA were stronger (boys: r = 0.14-0.21; girls: r = 0.07-0.11; P < .010) and there were significant associations with BMI, WC, triceps skinfold, and SBP and accelerometer MVPA (P < .01). In girls, there were no significant associations between biomarkers and any measures of physical activity. Physical activity measures should be selected based on the outcome of interest and study population; however, associations between PA and these biomarkers appear to be weak regardless of the measure used.\n\nThe method of attachment influences accelerometer-based activity data in dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartin, Kyle W; Olsen, Anastasia M; Duncan, Colleen G; Duerr, Felix M\n\n2017-02-10\n\nAccelerometer-based activity monitoring is a promising new tool in veterinary medicine used to objectively assess activity levels in dogs. To date, it is unknown how device orientation, attachment method, and attachment of a leash to the collar holding an accelerometer affect canine activity data. It was our goal to evaluate whether attachment methods of accelerometers affect activity counts. Eight healthy, client-owned dogs were fitted with two identical neck collars to which two identical activity monitors were attached using six different methods of attachment. These methods of attachment evaluated the use of a protective case, positioning of the activity monitor and the tightness of attachment of the accelerometer. Lastly, the effect of leash attachment to the collar was evaluated. For trials where the effect of leash attachment to the collar was not being studied, the leash was attached to a harness. Activity data obtained from separate monitors within a given experiment were compared using Pearson correlation coefficients and across all experiments using the Kruskal-Wallis Test. There was excellent correlation and low variability between activity monitors on separate collars when the leash was attached to a harness, regardless of their relative positions. There was good correlation when activity monitors were placed on the same collar regardless of orientation. There were poor correlations between activity monitors in three experiments: when the leash was fastened to the collar that held an activity monitor, when one activity monitor was housed in the protective casing, and when one activity monitor was loosely zip-tied to the collar rather than threaded on using the provided metal loop. Follow-up, pair-wise comparisons identified the correlation associated with these three methods of attachment to be statistically different from the level of correlation when monitors were placed on separate collars. While accelerometer-based activity monitors are useful\n\nComparison of pedometer and accelerometer measures of physical activity during preschool time on 3- to 5-year-old children.\n\nPubMed\n\nPagels, Peter; Boldemann, Cecilia; Raustorp, Anders\n\n2011-01-01\n\nTo compare pedometer steps with accelerometer counts and to analyse minutes of engagement in light, moderate and vigorous physical activity in 3- to 5-year-old children during preschool time. Physical activity was recorded during preschool time for five consecutive days in 55 three- to five-year-old children. The children wore a Yamax SW200 pedometer and an Actigraph GTIM Monitor. The average time spent at preschool was 7.22 h/day with an average step of 7313 (Â±3042). Steps during preschool time increased with increasing age. The overall correlation between mean step counts and mean accelerometer counts (r = 0.67, p < 0.001), as well as time in light to vigorous activity (r = 0.76, p < 0.001), were moderately high. Step counts and moderate to vigorous physical activity minutes were poorly correlated in 3 years old (r = 0.19, p < 0.191) and moderately correlated (r = 0.50, p < 0.001) for children 4 to 5 years old. Correlation between the preschool children's pedometer-determined step counts and total engagement in physical activity during preschool time was moderately high. Children's step counts at preschool were low, and the time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity at preschool was very short.

We investigated the relationship between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and the severity of urinary symptoms in older community-dwelling women with urinary incontinence using accelerometers. This is a secondary analysis of a study that measured physical activity (step count, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time) and sedentary behavior (percentage of sedentary time, number of sedentary bouts per day) using a triaxial accelerometer in older community-dwelling adult women not actively seeking treatment of their urinary symptoms. The relationship between urinary symptoms and physical activity variables was measured using linear regression. Our cohort of 35 community-dwelling women (median, age, 71 years) demonstrated low physical activity (median daily step count, 2168; range, 687-5205) and high sedentary behavior (median percentage of sedentary time, 74%; range, 54%-89%). Low step count was significantly associated with nocturia (P = 0.02). Shorter duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity time was significantly associated with nocturia (P = 0.001), nocturnal enuresis (P = 0.04), and greater use of incontinence products (P = 0.04). Greater percentage of time spent in sedentary behavior was also significantly associated with nocturia (P = 0.016). Low levels of physical activity are associated with greater nocturia and nocturnal enuresis. Sedentary behavior is a new construct that may be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. Physical activity and sedentary behavior represent potential new targets for treating nocturnal urinary tract symptoms.\n\nActivity Monitors Step Count Accuracy in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, Marquell\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective: To examine the step count accuracy of activity monitors in community-dwelling older adults. Method : Twenty-nine participants aged 67.70 Â± 6.07 participated. Three pedometers and the Actical accelerometer step count functions were compared with actual steps taken during a 200-m walk around an indoor track and during treadmill walking at three different speeds. Results : There was no statistical difference between activity monitors step counts and actual steps during self-selected pace walking. During treadmill walking at 0.67 mâs -1 , all activity monitors step counts were significantly different from actual steps. During treadmill walking at 0.894mâs -1 , the Omron HJ-112 pedometer step counts were not significantly different from actual steps. During treadmill walking at 1.12 mâs -1 , the Yamax SW-200 pedometer steps were significantly different from actual steps. Discussion : Activity monitor selection should be deliberate when examining the walking behaviors of community-dwelling older adults, especially for those who walk at a slower pace.\n\nComparison of self-reported versus accelerometer-measured physical activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nDyrstad, Sindre M; Hansen, BjÃ¸rge H; Holme, Ingar M; Anderssen, Sigmund A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is one of the most widely used questionnaires to assess physical activity (PA). Validation studies for the IPAQ have been executed, but still there is a need for studies comparing absolute values between IPAQ and accelerometer in large population studies. To compare PA and sedentary time from the self-administered, short version of the IPAQ with data from ActiGraph accelerometer in a large national sample. A total of 1751 adults (19-84 yr) wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT1M) for seven consecutive days and completed the IPAQ-Short Form. Sedentary time, total PA, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity were compared in relation to sex, age, and education. Men and women reported, on average, 131 minÂ·d (SE = 4 minÂ·d) less sedentary time compared with the accelerometer measurements. The difference between self-reported and measured sedentary time and vigorous-intensity PA was greatest among men with a lower education level and for men 65 yr and older. Although men reported 47% more moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) compared with women, there were no differences between sexes in accelerometer-determined MVPA. Accelerometer-determined moderate PA was reduced from 110 to 42 minÂ·d (62%) when analyzed in blocks of 10 min (P < 0.0001) compared with 1-min blocks. The main correlation coefficients between self-reported variables and accelerometer measures of physical activity were between 0.20 and 0.46. The participants report through IPAQ-Short Form more vigorous PA and less sedentary time compared with the accelerometer. The difference between self-reported and accelerometer-measured MVPA increased with higher activity and intensity levels. Associations between the methods were affected by sex, age, and education, but not body mass index.\n\nComparison of Physical Activity Adult Questionnaire results with accelerometer data.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarriguet, Didier; Tremblay, Sylvain; Colley, Rachel C\n\n2015-07-01\n\nDiscrepancies between self-reported and objectively measured physical activity are well-known. For the purpose of validation, this study compares a new self-reported physical activity questionnaire with an existing one and with accelerometer data. Data collected at one site of the Canadian Health Measures Survey in 2013 were used for this validation study. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was administered to respondents during the household interview, and the new Physical Activity for Adults Questionnaire (PAAQ) was administered during a subsequent visit to a mobile examination centre (MEC). At the MEC, respondents were given an accelerometer to wear for seven days. The analysis pertains to 112 respondents aged 18 to 79 who wore the accelerometer for 10 or more hours on at least four days. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) measured by accelerometer had higher correlation with data from the PAAQ (r = 0.44) than with data from the IPAQ (r = 0.20). The differences between accelerometer and PAAQ data were greater based on accelerometer-measured physical activity accumulated in 10-minute bouts (30-minute difference in MVPA) than on all minutes (9-minute difference). The percentages of respondents meeting the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines were 90% based on self-reported IPAQ minutes, 70% based on all accelerometer MVPA minutes, 29% based on accelerometer MVPA minutes accumulated in 10-minute bouts, and 61% based on self-reported PAAQ minutes. The PAAQ demonstrated reasonable validity against the accelerometer criterion. Based on correlations and absolute differences between daily minutes of MVPA and the percentages of respondents meeting the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines, PAAQ results were closer to accelerometer data than were the IPAQ results for the study sample and previous Statistics Canada self-reported questionnaire findings.\n\nAssociations between accelerometer-derived physical activity and regional adiposity in young men and women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, H A; Storti, K L; Arena, V C; Kriska, A M; Gabriel, K K Pettee; Sutton-Tyrrell, K; Hames, K C; Conroy, M B\n\n2013-06-01\n\nEmpirical evidence supports an inverse relationship between physical activity (PA) and adiposity, but studies using detailed measures of both are scarce. The relationship between regional adiposity and accelerometer-derived PA in men and women are described. Cross-sectional analysis included 253 participants from a weight loss study limited to ages 20-45 years and BMI 25-39.9 kg m(-2) . PA data were collected with accelerometers and expressed as total accelerometer counts and average amount of time per day accumulated in different intensity levels [sedentary, light-, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA)]. Accumulation of time spent above 100 counts was expressed as total active time. Computed tomography (CT) was used to measure abdominal and adipose tissue (AT). Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between regional adiposity (dependent variable) and the various PA levels (independent variable), and were executed separately for men and women, adjusting for wear time, age, race, education, and BMI. Among males, light activity was inversely associated with total AT (Î² = -0.19; P = 0.02) as well as visceral AT (VAT) (Î² = -0.30; P = 0.03). Among females sedentary time was positively associated with VAT (Î² = 0.11; P = 0.04) and total active time was inversely associated with VAT (Î² = -0.12; P = 0.04). Findings from this study suggest that PA intensity level may influence regional adiposity differently in men and women. Additional research is needed in larger samples to clarify the difference in these associations by sex, create recommendations for the frequency, duration and intensity of PA needed to target fat deposits, and determine if these recommendations should differ by sex.

This study compared compliance and outcomes between hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers worn simultaneously by children during an active video games intervention. As part of a larger randomized crossover trial, participants (n = 73, age 10 to 12 years) wore 2 Actical accelerometers simultaneously during waking hours for 7 days, on the hip and wrist. Measurements were repeated at 4 timepoints: 1) at baseline, 2) during traditional video games condition, 3) during active video games condition, 4) during no video games condition. Compliance and intervention effects were compared between hip and wrist. There were no statistically significant differences at any timepoint in percentage compliance between hip (77% to 87%) and wrist (79% to 89%). Wrist-measured counts (difference of 64.3 counts per minute, 95% CI 4.4-124.3) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (12 min/day, 95% CI 0.3-23.7) were higher during the no video games condition compared with the traditional video games condition. There were no differences in hip-measured counts per minute or MVPA between conditions or sedentary time for hip or wrist. There were no differences in compliance between hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers during an intervention trial, however, intervention findings differed between hip and wrist.\n\nBlood pressure circadian pattern and physical exercise assessment by accelerometer and 7-day physical activity recall scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-Ortiz, Luis; Recio-RodrÃ­guez, JosÃ© I; Puig-Ribera, Anna; Lema-BartolomÃ©, Jorge; IbÃ¡Ã±ez-JalÃ³n, Elisa; GonzÃ¡lez-Viejo, Natividad; Guenaga-Saenz, Nahia; Agudo-Conde, Cristina; Patino-Alonso, Maria C; Gomez-Marcos, Manuel A\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe relationship between regular physical activity, measured objectively and by self-report, and the circadian pattern of 24-hour ambulatory arterial blood pressure (BP) has not been clarified. We performed a cross-sectional study in a cohort of healthy patients. We included 1,345 patients from the EVIDENT study (mean age 55 Â± 14 years; 59.3% women). Physical activity was assessed using the 7-day physical activity recall (PAR) questionnaire (metabolic equivalents (MET)/hour/week) and the Actigraph GT3X accelerometer (counts/minute) for 7 days; ambulatory arterial BP was measured with a radial tonometer (B-pro device). The dipper-pattern patients showed a higher level of activity than nondipper patients, as assessed by accelerometer and 7-day PAR. Physical activity measures correlated positively with the percent drop in systolic BP (SBP; Ï = 0.19 to 0.11; P < 0.01) and negatively with the systolic and diastolic sleep to wake ratios (Ï = -0.10 to -0.18; P < 0.01) and heart rate (Ï = -0.13; P < 0.01). In logistic regression, considering the circadian pattern (1, dipper; 0, nondipper) as the dependent variable, the odds ratio of the third tertile of counts/minute was 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-2.38; P < 0.01) and of MET/hour/week was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.01-1.75; P = 0.04) after adjustment for confounding variables. Physical activity, as evaluated by both the accelerometer and the 7-day PAR, was associated with a more marked nocturnal BP dip and, accordingly, a lower SBP and diastolic BP sleep to wake ratio.

Accelerometers have greatly improved quantification of physical activity by providing information on step counts, body positions, energy expenditure, and magnitude of force. The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the validity and reliability of accelerometers used in patients with COPD. An electronic database search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was performed. Study quality was assessed with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist while methodological quality was assessed using the modified Quality Appraisal Tool for Reliability Studies. The search yielded 5392 studies; 25 met inclusion criteria. The SenseWear Pro armband reported high criterion validity under controlled conditions (r = 0.75-0.93) and high reliability (ICC = 0.84-0.86) for step counts. The DynaPort MiniMod demonstrated highest concurrent validity for step count using both video and manual methods. Validity of the SenseWear Pro armband varied between studies especially in free-living conditions, slower walking speeds, and with addition of weights during gait. A high degree of variability was found in the outcomes used and statistical analyses performed between studies, indicating a need for further studies to measure reliability and validity of accelerometers in COPD. The SenseWear Pro armband is the most commonly used accelerometer in COPD, but measurement properties are limited by gait speed variability and assistive device use. DynaPort MiniMod and Stepwatch accelerometers demonstrated high validity in patients with COPD but lack reliability data.\n\nAssessment of physical activity with the Computer Science and Applications, Inc., accelerometer: laboratory versus field validation.\n\nPubMed\n\nNichols, J F; Morgan, C G; Chabot, L E; Sallis, J F; Calfas, K J\n\n2000-03-01\n\nOur purpose was to compare the validity of the Computer Science and Applications, (CSA) Inc., accelerometer in laboratory and field settings and establish CSA count ranges for light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity. Validity was determined in 60 adults during treadmill exercise, using oxygen consumption (VO2) as the criterion measure, while 30 adults walked and jogged outdoors on a 400-m track. The relationship between CSA counts and VO2 was linear (R2 = .89 SEE = 3.72 ml.kg-1.min-1), as was the relationship between velocity and counts in the field (R2 = .89, SEE = 0.89 mi.hr-1). However, significant differences were found (p < .05) between laboratory and field measures of CSA counts for light and vigorous intensity. We conclude that the CSA can be used to quantify walking and jogging outdoors on level ground; however, laboratory equations may not be appropriate for use in field settings, particularly for light and vigorous activity.\n\nSedentary Time and Physical Activity Surveillance Through Accelerometer Pooling in Four European Countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoyen, Anne; Clarke-Cornwell, Alexandra M; Anderssen, Sigmund A; HagstrÃ¶mer, Maria; Sardinha, LuÃ­s B; Sundquist, Kristina; Ekelund, Ulf; Steene-Johannessen, Jostein; Baptista, FÃ¡tima; Hansen, BjÃ¸rge H; Wijndaele, Katrien; Brage, SÃ¸ren; Lakerveld, Jeroen; Brug, Johannes; van der Ploeg, Hidde P\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to pool, harmonise and re-analyse national accelerometer data from adults in four European countries in order to describe population levels of sedentary time and physical inactivity. Five cross-sectional studies were included from England, Portugal, Norway and Sweden. ActiGraph accelerometer count data were centrally processed using the same algorithms. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to study the associations of sedentary time and physical inactivity with sex, age, weight status and educational level, in both the pooled sample and the separate study samples. Data from 9509 participants were used. On average, participants were sedentary for 530Â min/day, and accumulated 36Â min/day of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. Twenty-three percent accumulated more than 10Â h of sedentary time/day, and 72% did not meet the physical activity recommendations. Nine percent of all participants were classified as high sedentary and low active. Participants from Norway showed the highest levels of sedentary time, while participants from England were the least physically active. Age and weight status were positively associated with sedentary time and not meeting the physical activity recommendations. Men and higher-educated people were more likely to be highly sedentary, while women and lower-educated people were more likely to be inactive. We found high levels of sedentary time and physical inactivity in four European countries. Older people and obese people were most likely to display these behaviours and thus deserve special attention in interventions and policy planning. In order to monitor these behaviours, accelerometer-based cross-European surveillance is recommended.\n\nValidity of Using Tri-Axial Accelerometers to Measure Human Movement â Part II: Step Counts at a Wide Range of Gait Velocities\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFortune, Emma; Lugade, Vipul; Morrow, Melissa; Kaufman, Kenton\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA subject-specific step counting method with a high accuracy level at all walking speeds is needed to assess the functional level of impaired patients.

We assessed the associations of questionnaire-assessed and accelerometer-assessed physical activity with adiposity markers in older adults. Design/Setting/Participants This was a cross-sectional study on 3940 participants (age range 60-83Â years) of the Whitehall II study who completed a 20-item physical activity questionnaire and wore a wrist-mounted accelerometer for 9Â days in 2012 andÂ 2013. Measurements Total physical activity was estimated using metabolic equivalent hours/week for the questionnaire and mean acceleration for the accelerometer. Time spent in moderate-and-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was also assessed by questionnaire and accelerometer. Adiposity assessment included body mass index, waist circumference, and fat mass index. Fat mass index was calculated as fat mass/heightÂ² (kg/mÂ²), with fat mass estimated using bioimpedance. Results Greater total physical activity was associated with lower adiposity for all adiposity markers in a dose-response manner. In men, the strength of this association was 2.4 to 2.8 times stronger with the accelerometer than with questionnaire data. In women, it was 1.9 to 2.3 times stronger. For MVPA, questionnaire data in men suggested no further benefit for adiposity markers past 1Â hour/week of activity. This was not the case for accelerometer-assessed MVPA where, for example, compared with men undertaking <1Â hour/week of accelerometer-assessed MVPA, waist circumference was 3.06 (95% confidence interval 2.06â4.06) cm lower in those performing MVPA 1â2.5Â hours/week, 4.69 (3.47â5.91) cm lower in those undertaking 2.5â4Â hours/week, and 7.11 (5.93â8.29) cm lower in those performing â¥4Â hours/week.

Ten healthy adults, with unrestricted mobility, wore both the activPAL and the discrete dual accelerometer (Analog Devices ADXL202)-based activity monitor that recorded in synchronization with each other. The accelerometer derived data were then compared to that generated by the activPAL and a complete statistical and error analysis was performed using a Matlab program. This program determined trunk and thigh inclination angles to distinguish between sitting/lying, standing and stepping for the discrete accelerometer device and amount of time spent on each activity. Analysis was performed on a second-by-second basis and then categorized at 15s intervals in direct comparison with the activPAL generated data. Of the total time monitored (approximately 60 h) the detection accuracies for static and dynamic activities were approximately 98%. In a population of healthy adults, the data obtained from the activPAL Professional physical activity logger for both static and dynamic activities showed a close match to a proven discrete accelerometer data with an offset of approximately 2% between the two systems.\n\nA universal, accurate intensity-based classification of different physical activities using raw data of accelerometer.\n\nPubMed\n\nVÃ¤hÃ¤-YpyÃ¤, Henri; Vasankari, Tommi; Husu, Pauliina; Suni, Jaana; SievÃ¤nen, Harri\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAccelerometers are increasingly used for objective assessment of physical activity. However, because of lack of the proprietary analysis algorithms, direct comparisons between accelerometer brands are difficult. In this study, we propose and evaluate open source methods for commensurate assessment of raw accelerometer data irrespective of the brand. Twenty-one participants carried simultaneously three different tri-axial accelerometers on their waist during five different sedentary activities and five different intensity levels of bipedal movement from slow walking to running. Several time and frequency domain traits were calculated from the measured raw data, and their performance in classifying the activities was compared. Of the several traits, the mean amplitude deviation (MAD) provided consistently the best performance in separating the sedentary activities and different speeds of bipedal movement from each other. Most importantly, the universal cut-off limits based on MAD classified sedentary activities and different intensity levels of walking and running equally well for all three accelerometer brands and reached at least 97% sensitivity and specificity in each case. Irrespective of the accelerometer brand, a simply calculable MAD with universal cut-off limits provides a universal method to evaluate physical activity and sedentary behaviour using raw accelerometer data. A broader application of the present approach is expected to render different accelerometer studies directly comparable with each other.

To these, other measures are added to summate to a comprehensive PA surveillance system. Recently, some national NCD surveillance systems have started using accelerometers as a measure of PA. The purpose of this paper was specifically to appraise the suitability and role of accelerometers for population-level PA surveillance. A thorough literature search was conducted to examine aspects of the generalisability, reliability, validity, comprehensiveness and between-study comparability of accelerometer estimates, and to gauge the simplicity, cost-effectiveness, adaptability and sustainability of their use in NCD surveillance. Accelerometer data collected in PA surveillance systems may not provide estimates that are generalisable to the target population. Accelerometer-based estimates have adequate reliability for PA surveillance, but there are still several issues associated with their validity. Accelerometer-based prevalence estimates are largely dependent on the investigators' choice of intensity cut-off points. Maintaining standardised accelerometer data collections in long-term PA surveillance systems is difficult, which may cause discontinuity in time-trend data. The use of accelerometers does not necessarily produce useful between-study and international comparisons due to lack of standardisation of data collection and processing methods. To conclude, it appears that accelerometers still have limitations regarding generalisability, validity, comprehensiveness, simplicity, affordability, adaptability, between-study comparability and sustainability. Therefore, given the current evidence, it seems that the widespread adoption of accelerometers specifically for large-scale PA surveillance systems may be premature.

Data were analyzed from 52 participants (27 men, 25 women; mean age = 38.2 +/- 12.0 yr; mean BMI = 26.4 +/- 4.5 kg x m(-2)) who were enrolled in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire study and wore both motion sensors during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. Participants averaged 415.0+/-159.5 CSA-counts x min(-1) x d(-1), 357,601 +/- 138,425 CSA-counts x d(-1), 11,483 +/- 3,856 CSA-steps x d(-1), and 9,638 +/- 4,030 pedometer-steps x d(-1). There was a strong relationship between all CSA outputs and pedometer outputs (r = 0.74-0.86). The mean difference in steps detected between instruments was 1845+/-2116 steps x d(-1) (CSA > pedometer; t = 6.29, P < 0.0001). There were distinct differences (effect sizes >0.80) in mean CSA-time (min x d(-1)) in moderate and vigorous activity with increasing pedometer-determined activity quartiles; no differences were noted for inactivity or light activity. Approximately 33 CSA-min x d(-1) of moderate activity corresponded with 8000 pedometer-steps x d(-1). Differences in mean steps per day detected may be due to differences in set instrument sensitivity thresholds and/or attachment. Additional studies with different populations are needed to confirm a recommended number of steps per day associated with the duration and intensity of public health recommendations for ambulatory activity.\n\nClassification of Sporting Activities Using Smartphone Accelerometers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMitchell, Edmond; Monaghan, David; O'Connor, Noel E.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this paper we present a framework that allows for the automatic identification of sporting activities using commonly available smartphones. We extract discriminative informational features from smartphone accelerometers using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Despite the poor quality of their accelerometers, smartphones were used as capture devices due to their prevalence in today's society. Successful classification on this basis potentially makes the technology accessible to both elite and non-elite athletes. Extracted features are used to train different categories of classifiers. No one classifier family has a reportable direct advantage in activity classification problems to date; thus we examine classifiers from each of the most widely used classifier families. We investigate three classification approaches; a commonly used SVM-based approach, an optimized classification model and a fusion of classifiers. We also investigate the effect of changing several of the DWT input parameters, including mother wavelets, window lengths and DWT decomposition levels. During the course of this work we created a challenging sports activity analysis dataset, comprised of soccer and field-hockey activities. The average maximum F-measure accuracy of 87% was achieved using a fusion of classifiers, which was 6% better than a single classifier model and 23% better than a standard SVM approach.

A total of 92 children and adolescents (40 males, 52 females) with BMIââ¥â90th percentile for sex and age, aged 5-17 years had valid GT3Xâ+âaccelerometer-assessed PA and interview-assessed self-reported information on PA engagement at the time of enrollment in a multidisciplinary outpatient tertiary treatment for childhood obesity. Accelerometer-derived mean overall PA and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical intensity were generated, applying cut-offs based on Vector Magnitude settings as defined by Romanzini etÂ al. (2014), and a physical activity score (PAS) based on self-reported data. Overall, a higher self-reported PAS was correlated with higher accelerometer-assessed daily total PA levels ( râ=â0.34, pâ<â.01) and children who reported a high PAS were more physically active compared with children who reported a low PAS. There was a fair level of agreement between self-reported PAS and accelerometer-assessed PA (Kappa agreementâ=â0.23; 95% CIâ=â[0.03, 0.43]; pâ=â.01). PAS, derived from self-report, may be a useful instrument for evaluating PA at a group level among children and adolescents enrolled in multidisciplinary obesity treatment.\n\nAccelerometer output and its association with energy expenditure during manual wheelchair propulsion.\n\nPubMed\n\nLearmonth, Y C; Kinnett-Hopkins, D; Rice, I M; Dysterheft, J L; Motl, R W\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThis is an experimental design. This study examined the association between rates of energy expenditure (that is, oxygen consumption (VO2)) and accelerometer counts (that is, vector magnitude (VM)) across a range of speeds during manual wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven treadmill. Such an association allows for the generation of cutoff points for quantifying the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during manual wheelchair propulsion. The study was conducted in the University Laboratory. Twenty-four manual wheelchair users completed a 6-min period of seated rest and three 6-min periods of manual wheelchair propulsion on a motor-driven wheelchair treadmill. The 6-min periods of wheelchair propulsion corresponded with three treadmill speeds (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5âmph) that elicited a range of physical activity intensities. Participants wore a portable metabolic unit and accelerometers on both wrists. Primary outcome measures included steady-state VO2 and VM, and the strength of association between VO2 and VM was based on the multiple correlation and squared multiple correlation coefficients from linear regression analyses. Strong linear associations were established between VO2 and VM for the left (R=0.93Â±0.44; R2=0.87Â±0.19), right (R=0.95Â±0.37; R2=0.90Â±0.14) and combined (R=0.94Â±0.38; R2=0.88Â±0.15) accelerometers. The linear relationship between VO2 and VM for the left, right and combined wrists yielded cutoff points for MVPA of 3659 Â±1302, 3630Â±1403 and 3644Â±1339 counts min(-1), respectively. We provide cutoff points based on the linear association between energy expenditure and accelerometer counts for estimating time spent in MVPA during manual wheelchair propulsion using wrist-worn accelerometry. The similarity across wrist location permits flexibility in selecting a location for wrist accelerometry placement.\n\nThe Impact of Accelerometers on Physical Activity and Weight Loss: A Systematic Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGoode, Adam P.; Hall, Katherine S.; Batch, Bryan C.; Huffman, Kim M.; Hastings, S. Nicole; Allen, Kelli D.; Shaw, Ryan J.; Kanach, Frances A.; McDuffie, Jennifer R.; Kosinski, Andrzej S.; Williams, John W.; Gierisch, Jennifer M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Regular physical activity is important for improving and maintaining health, but sedentary behavior is difficult to change. Providing objective, real-time feedback on physical activity with wearable motion-sensing technologies (activity monitors) may be a promising, scalable strategy to increase physical activity or decrease weight. Purpose We synthesized the literature on the use of wearable activity monitors for improving physical activity and weight-related outcomes and evaluated moderating factors that may have an impact on effectiveness. Methods We searched five databases from January 2000 to January 2015 for peer-reviewed, English-language randomized controlled trials among adults. Random-effects models were used to produce standardized mean differences (SMDs) for physical activity outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for weight outcomes. Heterogeneity was measured with I2. Results Fourteen trials (2,972 total participants) met eligibility criteria; accelerometers were used in all trials. Twelve trials examined accelerometer interventions for increasing physical activity. A small significant effect was found for increasing physical activity (SMD 0.26; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.49; I2=64.7%). Intervention duration was the only moderator found to significantly explain high heterogeneity for physical activity. Eleven trials examined effects of accelerometer interventions on weight. Pooled estimates showed a small significant effect for weight loss (MD â1.65 kg; 95% CI â3.03 to â0.28; I2=81%), and no moderators were significant. Conclusions Accelerometers demonstrated small positive effects on physical activity and weight loss. The small sample sizes with moderate to high heterogeneity in the current studies limit the conclusions that may be drawn. Future studies should focus on how best to integrate accelerometers with other strategies to increase physical activity and weight loss.

Accelerometry has emerged as an effective means for long-term physical activity monitoring in the elderly. However, the output of an accelerometer varies at different positions on a subject's body, even for the same activity, resulting in high within-class variance. Existing accelerometer-based activity recognition systems thus require firm attachment of the sensor to a subject's body. This requirement makes them impractical for long-term activity monitoring during unsupervised free-living as it forces subjects into a fixed life pattern and impede their daily activities. Therefore, we introduce a novel single-triaxial-accelerometer-based activity recognition system that reduces the high within-class variance significantly and allows subjects to carry the sensor freely in any pocket without its firm attachment. We validated our system using seven activities: resting (lying/sitting/standing), walking, walking-upstairs, walking-downstairs, running, cycling, and vacuuming, recorded from five positions: chest pocket, front left trousers pocket, front right trousers pocket, rear trousers pocket, and inner jacket pocket. Its simplicity, ability to perform activities unimpeded, and an average recognition accuracy of 94% make our system a practical solution for continuous long-term activity monitoring in the elderly.\n\nEvaluation of artificial neural network algorithms for predicting METs and activity type from accelerometer data: validation on an independent sample.\n\nPubMed\n\nFreedson, Patty S; Lyden, Kate; Kozey-Keadle, Sarah; Staudenmayer, John\n\n2011-12-01\n\nPrevious work from our laboratory provided a \"proof of concept\" for use of artificial neural networks (nnets) to estimate metabolic equivalents (METs) and identify activity type from accelerometer data (Staudenmayer J, Pober D, Crouter S, Bassett D, Freedson P, J Appl Physiol 107: 1330-1307, 2009). The purpose of this study was to develop new nnets based on a larger, more diverse, training data set and apply these nnet prediction models to an independent sample to evaluate the robustness and flexibility of this machine-learning modeling technique. The nnet training data set (University of Massachusetts) included 277 participants who each completed 11 activities. The independent validation sample (n = 65) (University of Tennessee) completed one of three activity routines. Criterion measures were 1) measured METs assessed using open-circuit indirect calorimetry; and 2) observed activity to identify activity type. The nnet input variables included five accelerometer count distribution features and the lag-1 autocorrelation. The bias and root mean square errors for the nnet MET trained on University of Massachusetts and applied to University of Tennessee were +0.32 and 1.90 METs, respectively. Seventy-seven percent of the activities were correctly classified as sedentary/light, moderate, or vigorous intensity. For activity type, household and locomotion activities were correctly classified by the nnet activity type 98.1 and 89.5% of the time, respectively, and sport was correctly classified 23.7% of the time. Use of this machine-learning technique operates reasonably well when applied to an independent sample. We propose the creation of an open-access activity dictionary, including accelerometer data from a broad array of activities, leading to further improvements in prediction accuracy for METs, activity intensity, and activity type.\n\nIndividual characteristics associated with mismatches between self-reported and accelerometer-measured physical activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nTully, Mark A; Panter, Jenna; Ogilvie, David\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAccurate assessment tools are required for the surveillance of physical activity (PA) levels and the assessment of the effect of interventions. In addition, increasing awareness of PA is often used as the first step in pragmatic behavioural interventions, as discrepancies between the amount of activity an individual perceives they do and the amount actually undertaken may act as a barrier to change. Previous research has demonstrated differences in the amount of activity individuals report doing, compared to their level of physical activity when measured with an accelerometer. Understanding the characteristics of those whose PA level is ranked differently when measured with either self-report or accelerometry is important as it may inform the choice of instrument for future research. The aim of this project was to determine which individual characteristics are associated with differences between self-reported and accelerometer measured physical activity. Participant data from the 2009 wave of the Commuting and Health in Cambridge study were used. Quartiles of self-reported and accelerometer-measured PA were derived by ranking each measure from lowest to highest. These quartiles were compared to determine whether individuals' physical activity was ranked higher by either method. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate the individual characteristics associated with different categories of mismatch. Data from 486 participants (70% female) were included in the analysis. In adjusted analyses, the physical activity of overweight or obese individuals was significantly more likely to be ranked higher by self-report than by accelerometer than that of normal-weight individuals (OR = 2.07, 95%CI = 1.28-3.34), particularly among women (OR = 3.97, 95%CI = 2.11-7.47). There was a greater likelihood of mismatch between self-reported and accelerometer measured physical activity levels in overweight or obese adults. Future studies in overweight or obese\n\nAccelerometer-determined physical activity level among government employees in Penang, Malaysia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHazizi, A S; Aina, Mardiah B; Mohd, Nasir M T; Zaitun, Y; Hamid, Jan J M; Tabata, I\n\n2012-04-01\n\nA cross-sectional study was carried out to investigate accelerometer-determined physical activity level of 233 Malay government employees (104 men, 129 women) working in the Federal Government Building Penang, Malaysia. Body weight, height, waist and hip circumference, body fat percentage and blood pressure were measured for each respondent. All the respondents were asked to wear an accelerometer for 3 days. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated using a standard formulas. Fasting blood sample was obtained to determine the lipid profile and glucose levels of the respondents. Based on the accelerometer-determined physical activity level, almost 65% of the respondents were categorised as sedentary. Approximately 50.2% of the respondents were overweight or obese. There were negative but significant relationships between body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.353, p < 0.05), body fat percentage (r = -0.394, p < 0.05), waist circumference (WC) (r = -0.198, p < 0.05) and physical activity level. Sedentary individuals had a higher risk than moderate to active individuals of having a BMI more than or equal to 25 kg/m2 (OR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.55-5.05), an-risk classified WC (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.01-3.20), and a body fat percentage classified as unhealthy (OR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.41-6.44). The results of this study suggest that accelerometer-determined physical activity level is a significant factor associated with obesity in this study. The high prevalence of physical inactivity and obesity found among respondents of this study indicate a need for implementing intervention programmes among this population.\n\nCognitive function and the agreement between self-reported and accelerometer-accessed physical activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nHerbolsheimer, Florian; Riepe, Matthias W; Peter, Richard\n\n2018-02-21\n\nNumerous studies have reported weak or moderate correlations between self-reported and accelerometer-assessed physical activity. One explanation is that self-reported physical activity might be biased by demographic, cognitive or other factors. Cognitive function is one factor that could be associated with either overreporting or underreporting of daily physical activity. Difficulties in remembering past physical activities might result in recall bias. Thus, the current study examines whether the cognitive function is associated with differences between self-reported and accelerometer-assessed physical activity. Cross-sectional data from the population-based Activity and Function in the Elderly in Ulm study (ActiFE) were used. A total of 1172 community-dwelling older adults (aged 65-90Â years) wore a uniaxial accelerometer (activPAL unit) for a week. Additionally, self-reported physical activity was assessed using the LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire (LAPAQ). Cognitive function was measured with four items (immediate memory, delayed memory, recognition memory, and semantic fluency) from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Total Score (CERAD-TS). Mean differences of self-reported and accelerometer-assessed physical activity (MPA) were associated with cognitive function in men (r s â=â-.12, pâ=â.002) but not in women. Sex-stratified multiple linear regression analyses showed that MPA declined with high cognitive function in men (Î²â=â-.13; pâ=â.015). Results suggest that self-reported physical activity should be interpreted with caution in older populations, as cognitive function was one factor that explained the differences between objective and subjective physical activity measurements.\n\nUse of population-referenced total activity counts percentiles to assess and classify physical activity of population groups.\n\nPubMed\n\nWolff-Hughes, Dana L; Troiano, Richard P; Boyer, William R; Fitzhugh, Eugene C; McClain, James J\n\n2016-06-01\n\nPopulation-referenced total activity counts per day (TAC/d) percentiles provide public health practitioners a standardized measure of physical activity (PA) volume obtained from an accelerometer that can be compared across populations. The purpose of this study was to describe the application of TAC/d population-referenced percentiles to characterize the PA levels of population groups relative to US estimates. A total of 679 adults participating in the 2011 NYC Physical Activity Transit survey wore an ActiGraph accelerometer on their hip for seven consecutive days. Accelerometer-derived TAC/d was classified into age- and gender-specific quartiles of US population-referenced TAC/d to compare differences in the distributions by borough (N=5). Males in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Staten Island had significantly greater TAC/d than US males. Females in Brooklyn and Queens had significantly greater levels of TAC/d compared to US females. The proportion of males in each population-referenced TAC/d quartile varied significantly by borough (Ï(2)(12)=2.63, p=0.002), with disproportionately more men in Manhattan and the Bronx found to be in the highest and lowest US population-referenced TAC/d quartiles, respectively. For females, there was no significant difference in US population-reference TAC/d quartile by borough (Ï(2)(12)=1.09, p=0.36). These results demonstrate the utility of population-referenced TAC/d percentiles in public health monitoring and surveillance. These findings also provide insights into the PA levels of NYC residents relative to the broader US population, which can be used to guide health promotion efforts.

The aim of this study was to evaluate characteristics of physical activities in daily life in this population by using an accurate triaxial accelerometer and to correlate these characteristics with physiological variables. Nineteen HD patients were evaluated using the DynaPort accelerometer and compared to nineteen control individuals, regarding the time spent in different activities and positions of daily life and the number of steps taken. HD patients were more sedentary than control individuals, spending less time walking or standing and spending more time lying down. The sedentary behavior was more pronounced on dialysis days. According to the number of steps taken per day, 47.4% of hemodialysis patients were classified as sedentary against 10.5% in control group. Hemoglobin level, lower extremity muscle strength, and physical functioning of SF-36 questionnaire correlated significantly with the walking time and active time. Looking accurately at the patterns of activity in daily life, HDs patients are more sedentary, especially on dialysis days. These patients should be motivated to enhance the physical activity. PMID:26090432\n\nMeasuring moderate-intensity walking in older adults using the ActiGraph accelerometer.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarnett, Anthony; van den Hoek, Daniel; Barnett, David; Cerin, Ester\n\n2016-12-08\n\nAccelerometry is the method of choice for objectively assessing physical activity in older adults. Many studies have used an accelerometer count cut point corresponding to 3 metabolic equivalents (METs) derived in young adults during treadmill walking and running with a resting metabolic rate (RMR) assumed at 3.5Â mLâÂ·âkg -1 âÂ·âmin -1 (corresponding to 1 MET). RMR is lower in older adults; therefore, their 3 MET level occurs at a lower absolute energy expenditure making the cut point derived from young adults inappropriate for this population. The few studies determining older adult specific moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) cut points had methodological limitations, such as not measuring RMR and using treadmill walking. This study determined a MVPA hip-worn accelerometer cut point for older adults using measured RMR and overground walking. Following determination of RMR, 45 older adults (mean age 70.2âÂ±â7Â years, range 60-87.6Â years) undertook an outdoor, overground walking protocol with accelerometer count and energy expenditure determined at five walking speeds. Mean RMR was 2.8âÂ±â0.6Â mLâÂ·âkg -1 âÂ·âmin -1 . The MVPA cut points (95% CI) determined using linear mixed models were: vertical axis 1013 (734, 1292) countsâÂ·âmin -1 ; vector magnitude 1924 (1657, 2192) countsâÂ·âmin -1 ; and walking speed 2.5 (2.2, 2.8) kmâÂ·âhr -1 . High levels of inter-individual variability in cut points were found. These MVPA accelerometer and speed cut points for walking, the most popular physical activity in older adults, were lower than those for younger adults. Using cut points determined in younger adults for older adult population studies is likely to underestimate time spent engaged in MVPA. In addition, prescription of walking speed based on the adult cut point is likely to result in older adults working at a higher intensity than intended.\n\nUsing open source accelerometer analysis to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviour in overweight and obese adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nInnerd, Paul; Harrison, Rory; Coulson, Morc\n\n2018-04-23\n\nPhysical activity and sedentary behaviour are difficult to assess in overweight and obese adults. However, the use of open-source, raw accelerometer data analysis could overcome this. This study compared raw accelerometer and questionnaire-assessed moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking and sedentary behaviour in normal, overweight and obese adults, and determined the effect of using different methods to categorise overweight and obesity, namely body mass index (BMI), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). One hundred twenty adults, aged 24-60Â years, wore a raw, tri-axial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+), for 3Â days and completed a physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-S). We used open-source accelerometer analyses to estimate MVPA, walking and sedentary behaviour from a single raw accelerometer signal. Accelerometer and questionnaire-assessed measures were compared in normal, overweight and obese adults categorised using BMI, BIA and WHR. Relationships between accelerometer and questionnaire-assessed MVPA (Rsâ=â0.30 to 0.48) and walking (Rsâ=â0.43 to 0.58) were stronger in normal and overweight groups whilst sedentary behaviour were modest (Rsâ=â0.22 to 0.38) in normal, overweight and obese groups. The use of WHR resulted in stronger agreement between the questionnaire and accelerometer than BMI and BIA. Finally, accelerometer data showed stronger associations with BMI, BIA and WHR (Rsâ=â0.40 to 0.77) than questionnaire data (Rsâ=â0.24 to 0.37). Open-source, raw accelerometer data analysis can be used to estimate MVPA, walking and sedentary behaviour from a single acceleration signal in normal, overweight and obese adults. Our data supports the use of WHR to categorise overweight and obese adults. This evidence helps researchers obtain more accurate measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in overweight and obese populations.\n\nComparison of IPAQ-SF and Two Other Physical Activity Questionnaires with Accelerometer in Adolescent Boys.\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ¤Ã¤sk, Triin; MÃ¤estu, Jarek; LÃ¤tt, Evelin; JÃ¼rimÃ¤e, Jaak; JÃ¼rimÃ¤e, Toivo; Vainik, Uku; Konstabel, Kenn\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSelf-report measures of physical activity (PA) are easy to use and popular but their reliability is often questioned. Therefore, the general aim of the present study was to investigate the association of PA questionnaires with accelerometer derived PA, in a sample of adolescent boys. In total, 191 pubertal boys (mean age 14.0 years) completed three self-report questionnaires and wore an accelerometer (ActiGraph GT1M) for 7 consecutive days. The PA questionnaires were: International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), Tartu Physical Activity Questionnaire (TPAQ), and the Inactivity subscale from Domain-Specific Impulsivity (DSI) scale. All three questionnaires were significantly correlated with accelerometer derived MVPA: the correlations were 0.31 for the IPAQ-SF MVPA, 0.34 for the TPAQ MVPA and -0.29 for the DSI Inactivity scale. Nevertheless, none of the questionnaires can be used as a reliable individual-level estimate of MVPA in male adolescents. The boys underreported their MVPA in IPAQ-SF as compared to accelerometer-derived MVPA (respective averages 43 and 56 minutes); underreporting was more marked in active boys with average daily MVPA at least 60 minutes, and was not significant in less active boys. Conversely, MVPA index from TPAQ overestimated the MVPA in less active boys but underestimated it in more active boys. The sedentary time reported in IPAQ-SF was an underestimate as compared to accelerometer-derived sedentary time (averages 519 and 545 minutes, respectively).\n\nAssessing Physical Activity in Children with Asthma: Convergent Validity between Accelerometer and Electronic Diary Data\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFloro, Josh N.; Dunton, Genevieve F.; Delfino, Ralph J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nConvergent validity of accelerometer and electronic diary physical activity data was assessed in children with asthma. Sixty-two participants, ages 9-18 years, wore an accelerometer and reported their physical activity level in quarter-hour segments every 2 hr using the Ambulatory Diary Assessment (ADA). Moderate validity was found betweenâ¦\n\nA calibration protocol for population-specific accelerometer cut-points in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nMackintosh, Kelly A; Fairclough, Stuart J; Stratton, Gareth; Ridgers, Nicola D\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo test a field-based protocol using intermittent activities representative of children's physical activity behaviours, to generate behaviourally valid, population-specific accelerometer cut-points for sedentary behaviour, moderate, and vigorous physical activity. Twenty-eight children (46% boys) aged 10-11 years wore a hip-mounted uniaxial GT1M ActiGraph and engaged in 6 activities representative of children's play. A validated direct observation protocol was used as the criterion measure of physical activity. Receiver Operating Chara"
