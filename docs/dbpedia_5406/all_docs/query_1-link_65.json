        "meta_description": "Abstract. Gravity waves are one of the main drivers of atmospheric dynamics. The\nspatial resolution of most global atmospheric models, however, is too coarse\nto properly resolve the small scales of gravity waves, which range from tens\nto a few thousand kilometers horizontally, and from below 1âkm to tens of\nkilometers vertically. Gravity wave source processes involve even smaller\nscales. Therefore, general circulation models (GCMs) and chemistry climate\nmodels (CCMs) usually parametrize the effect of gravity waves on the global\ncirculation. These parametrizations are very simplified. For this reason,\ncomparisons with global observations of gravity waves are needed for an\nimprovement of parametrizations and an alleviation of model biases. We present a gravity wave climatology based on atmospheric infrared limb\nemissions observed by satellite (GRACILE). GRACILE is a global data set of\ngravity wave distributions observed in the stratosphere and the mesosphere by\nthe infrared limb sounding satellite instruments High Resolution Dynamics\nLimb Sounder (HIRDLS) and Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission\nRadiometry (SABER). Typical distributions (zonal averages and global maps) of\ngravity wave vertical wavelengths and along-track horizontal wavenumbers are\nprovided, as well as gravity wave temperature variances, potential energies\nand absolute momentum fluxes. This global data set captures the typical\nseasonal variations of these parameters, as well as their spatial variations.\nThe GRACILE data set is suitable for scientific studies, and it can serve for\ncomparison with other instruments (ground-based, airborne, or other satellite\ninstruments) and for comparison with gravity wave distributions, both\nresolved and parametrized, in GCMs and CCMs. The GRACILE data set is\navailable as supplementary data at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.879658.",

These waves perturb the temperature field, and thus, by observing three-dimensional temperature fluctuations, their properties can be quantified. This pre-study uses synthetic MATS data generated from a general circulation model to investigate how well wave properties can be retrieved.\n\nGlobal scale gravity wave analysis methodology for the ESA Earth Explorer 11 candidate CAIRT\n\nSebastian Rhode, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Inna Polichtchouk, Kaoru Sato, Shingo Watanabe, Manfred Ern, Karlheinz Nogai, BjÃ¶rn-Martin Sinnhuber, and Martin Riese\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1084,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1084, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the capabilities of a proposed satellite mission, CAIRT, for observing gravity waves throughout the middle atmosphere and present the necessary methodology for in-depth wave analysis. Our findings suggest that such a satellite mission is highly capable of resolving individual wave parameters and could give new insights into the role of gravity waves in the general atmospheric circulation and atmospheric processes.\n\nThe quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and global-scale tropical waves in Aeolus wind observations, radiosonde data, and reanalyses\n\nManfred Ern, Mohamadou A. Diallo, Dina Khordakova, Isabell Krisch, Peter Preusse, Oliver Reitebuch, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9549–9583, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9549-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9549-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of the stratospheric tropical winds is an important mode of climate variability but is not well reproduced in free-running climate models. We use the novel global wind observations by the Aeolus satellite and radiosondes to show that the QBO is captured well in three modern reanalyses (ERA-5, JRA-55, and MERRA-2). Good agreement is also found also between Aeolus and reanalyses for large-scale tropical wave modes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.\n\nA mountain ridge model for quantifying oblique mountain wave propagation and distribution\n\nSebastian Rhode, Peter Preusse, Manfred Ern, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Lukas Krasauskas, Julio Bacmeister, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7901–7934, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7901-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7901-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGravity waves (GWs) transport energy vertically and horizontally within the atmosphere and thereby affect wind speeds far from their sources. Here, we present a model that identifies orographic GW sources and predicts the pathways of the excited GWs through the atmosphere for a better understanding of horizontal GW propagation. We use this model to explain physical patterns in satellite observations (e.g., low GW activity above the Himalaya) and predict seasonal patterns of GW propagation.\n\nSatellite observations of gravity wave momentum flux in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT): feasibility and requirements\n\nQiuyu Chen, Konstantin Ntokas, BjÃ¶rn Linder, Lukas Krasauskas, Manfred Ern, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Erich Becker, Martin Kaufmann, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 7071–7103, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7071-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7071-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nObservations of phase speed and direction spectra as well as zonal mean net gravity wave momentum flux are required to understand how gravity waves reach the mesosphere–lower thermosphere and how they there interact with background flow. To this end we propose flying two CubeSats, each deploying a spatial heterodyne spectrometer for limb observation of the airglow. End-to-end simulations demonstrate that individual gravity waves are retrieved faithfully for the expected instrument performance.\n\nIntermittency of gravity wave potential energies and absolute momentum fluxes derived from infrared limb sounding satellite observations\n\nManfred Ern, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 22, 15093–15133, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15093-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15093-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on data from the HIRDLS and SABER infrared limb sounding satellite instruments, we investigate the intermittency of global distributions of gravity wave (GW) potential energies and GW momentum fluxes in the stratosphere and mesosphere using probability distribution functions (PDFs) and Gini coefficients. We compare GW intermittency in different regions, seasons, and altitudes. These results can help to improve GW parameterizations and the distributions of GWs resolved in models.\n\nStratospheric water vapour and ozone response to the quasi-biennial oscillation disruptions in 2016 and 2020\n\nMohamadou A. Diallo, Felix Ploeger, Michaela I. Hegglin, Manfred Ern, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Sergey Khaykin, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 14303–14321, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14303-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14303-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe quasi-biennial oacillation disruption events in both 2016 and 2020 decreased lower-stratospheric water vapour and ozone. Differences in the strength and depth of the anomalous lower-stratospheric circulation and ozone are due to differences in tropical upwelling and cold-point temperature induced by lower-stratospheric planetary and gravity wave breaking. The differences in water vapour are due to higher cold-point temperature in 2020 induced by Australian wildfire.\n\nPropagation paths and source distributions of resolved gravity waves in ECMWF-IFS analysis fields around the southern polar night jet\n\nCornelia Strube, Peter Preusse, Manfred Ern, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18641–18668, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18641-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18641-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh gravity wave (GW) momentum fluxes in the lower stratospheric southern polar vortex around 60° S are still poorly understood. Few GW sources are found at these latitudes. We present a ray tracing case study on waves resolved in high-resolution global model temperatures southeast of New Zealand. We show that lateral propagation of more than 1000 km takes place below 20 km altitude, and a variety of orographic and non-orographic sources located north of 50° S generate the wave field.\n\nThe semiannual oscillation (SAO) in the tropical middle atmosphere and its gravity wave driving in reanalyses and satellite observations\n\nManfred Ern, Mohamadou Diallo, Peter Preusse, Martin G. Mlynczak, Michael J. Schwartz, Qian Wu, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 13763–13795, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13763-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13763-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetails of the driving of the semiannual oscillation (SAO) of the tropical winds in the middle atmosphere are still not known. We investigate the SAO and its driving by small-scale gravity waves (GWs) using satellite data and different reanalyses. In a large altitude range, GWs mainly drive the SAO westerlies, but in the upper mesosphere GWs seem to drive both SAO easterlies and westerlies. Reanalyses reproduce some features of the SAO but are limited by model-inherent damping at upper levels.\n\nOrographically induced spontaneous imbalance within the jet causing a large-scale gravity wave event\n\nMarkus Geldenhuys, Peter Preusse, Isabell Krisch, Christoph ZÃ¼licke, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Manfred Ern, Felix Friedl-Vallon, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 10393–10412, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10393-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10393-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA large-scale gravity wave (GW) was observed spanning the whole of Greenland. The GWs proposed in this paper come from a new jet–topography mechanism. The topography compresses the flow and triggers a change in u- and v-wind components. The jet becomes out of geostrophic balance and sheds energy in the form of GWs to restore the balance. This topography–jet interaction was not previously considered by the community, rendering the impact of the gravity waves largely unaccounted for.\n\nThe advective BrewerâDobson circulation in the ERA5 reanalysis: climatology, variability, and trends\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Manfred Ern, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 7515–7544, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7515-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7515-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite good agreement in the spatial structure, there are substantial differences in the strength of the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) and its modulations in the UTLS and upper stratosphere. The tropical upwelling is generally weaker in ERA5 than in ERAI due to weaker planetary and gravity wave breaking in the UTLS. Analysis of the BDC trend shows an acceleration of the BDC of about 1.5 % decade-1 due to the long-term intensification in wave breaking, consistent with climate predictions.\n\nSuperposition of gravity waves with different propagation characteristics observed by airborne and space-borne infrared sounders\n\nIsabell Krisch, Manfred Ern, Lars Hoffmann, Peter Preusse, Cornelia Strube, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Wolfgang Woiwode, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 11469–11490, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11469-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11469-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2016, a scientific research flight above Scandinavia acquired various atmospheric data (temperature, gas composition, etc.). Through advanced 3-D reconstruction methods, a superposition of multiple gravity waves was identified. An in-depth analysis enabled the characterisation of these waves as well as the identification of their sources. This work will enable a better understanding of atmosphere dynamics and could lead to improved climate projections.\n\nRemoving spurious inertial instability signals from gravity wave temperature perturbations using spectral filtering methods\n\nCornelia Strube, Manfred Ern, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 4927–4945, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4927-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4927-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present how inertial instabilities affect gravity wave background removal filters on different temperature data sets. Vertical filtering has to remove a part of the gravity wave spectrum to eliminate inertial instability remnants, while horizontal filtering leaves typical gravity wave scales untouched. In addition, we show that it is possible to separate inertial instabilities from gravity wave perturbations for infrared limb-sounding satellite profiles using a cutoff zonal wavenumber of 6.\n\nGlobal analysis for periodic variations in gravity wave squared amplitudes and momentum fluxes in the middle atmosphere\n\nDan Chen, Cornelia Strube, Manfred Ern, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAnn. Geophys., 37, 487–506, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-487-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-487-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, for the first time, absolute gravity wave momentum flux (GWMF) on temporal scales from terannual variation up to solar cycle length is investigated. The systematic spectral analysis of SABER absolute GWMF is presented and physically interpreted. The various roles of filtering and oblique propagating are discussed, which is likely an important factor for MLT dynamics, and hence can be used as a stringent test bed of the reproduction of such features in global models.\n\nStructural changes in the shallow and transition branch of the BrewerâDobson circulation induced by El NiÃ±o\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Paul Konopka, Michelle L. Santee, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Mengchu Tao, Kaley A. Walker, Bernard Legras, Martin Riese, Manfred Ern, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 425–446, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-425-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-425-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper assesses the structural changes in the shallow and transition branches of the BDC induced by El Nino using the Lagrangian model simulations driven by ERAi and JRA-55 combined with MLS observations. We found a clear evidence of a weakening of the transition branch due to an upward shift in the dissipation height of the planetary and gravity waves and a strengthening of the shallow branch due to enhanced GW breaking in the tropics–subtropics and PW breaking at high latitudes.\n\nThree-dimensional tomographic reconstruction of atmospheric gravity waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)\n\nRui Song, Martin Kaufmann, Manfred Ern, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Guang Liu, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 3161–3175, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-3161-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-3161-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new observation strategy, called sweep mode, for a real three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction of gravity waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by modifying the observation geometry of conventional limb-sounding measurements. It enhances the horizontal resolution that typical limb sounders can achieve while at the same time retaining the good vertical resolution they have.\n\nOn the origin of the mesospheric quasi-stationary planetary waves in the unusual Arctic winterÂ 2015/2016\n\nVivien Matthias and Manfred Ern\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 4803–4815, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-4803-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-4803-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe aim of this study is to find the origin of mesospheric stationary planetary wave (SPW) in the subtropics and in mid and polar latitudes in mid winter 2015/2016. Our results based on observations show that upward propagating SPW and in situ generated SPWs by longitudinally variable gravity wave drag and by instabilities can be responsible for the occurrence of mesospheric SPWs and that they can act at the same time, which confirms earlier model studies.\n\nSatellite observations of middle atmosphereâthermosphere vertical coupling by gravity waves\n\nQuang Thai Trinh, Manfred Ern, Eelco Doornbos, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAnn. Geophys., 36, 425–444, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-425-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-425-2018, 2018\n\nIntercomparison of AIRS and HIRDLS stratospheric gravity wave observations\n\nCatrin I. Meyer, Manfred Ern, Lars Hoffmann, Quang Thai Trinh, and M. Joan Alexander\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 215–232, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-215-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-215-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate stratospheric gravity wave observations by the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS). Waves seen by AIRS contribute significantly to momentum flux, which indicates a calculated momentum flux factor. AIRS and HIRDLS agree well in the phase structure of the wave events and also in the seasonal and latitudinal patterns of gravity wave activity and can be used complementary to each other.\n\nFirst tomographic observations of gravity waves by the infrared limb imager GLORIA\n\nIsabell Krisch, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Andreas DÃ¶rnbrack, Stephen D. Eckermann, Manfred Ern, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Martin Kaufmann, Hermann Oelhaf, Markus Rapp, Cornelia Strube, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 14937–14953, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-14937-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-14937-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing the infrared limb imager GLORIA, the 3-D structure of mesoscale gravity waves in the lower stratosphere was measured for the first time, allowing for a complete 3-D characterization of the waves. This enables the precise determination of the sources of the waves in the mountain regions of Iceland with backward ray tracing. Forward ray tracing shows oblique propagation, an effect generally neglected in global atmospheric models.\n\nTomographic reconstruction of atmospheric gravity wave parameters from airglow observations\n\nRui Song, Martin Kaufmann, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Manfred Ern, Guang Liu, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 4601–4612, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-4601-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-4601-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGravity waves (GWs) play an important role in atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we propose a new observation strategy for GWs in the mesopause region by combining limb and sub-limb satellite-borne remote sensing measurements for improving the spatial resolution of temperatures that are retrieved from atmospheric soundings. It shows that one major advantage of this observation strategy is that much smaller-scale GWs can be observed.\n\nSatellite observations of middle atmosphere gravity wave absolute momentum flux and of its vertical gradient during recent stratospheric warmings\n\nManfred Ern, Quang Thai Trinh, Martin Kaufmann, Isabell Krisch, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Yajun Zhu, John C. Gille, Martin G. Mlynczak, James M. Russell III, Michael J. Schwartz, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 9983–10019, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-9983-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-9983-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) influence the atmospheric circulation over a large range of altitudes and latitudes. We investigate the global distribution of small-scale gravity waves (GWs) during SSWs as derived from 13 years of satellite observations. We find that GWs may play an important role for triggering SSWs by preconditioning the polar vortex, as well as during long-lasting vortex recovery phases after SSWs. The GW distribution during SSWs displays strong day-to-day variability.\n\nObservations of PAN and its confinement in the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone in high spatial resolution\n\nJÃ¶rn Ungermann, Mandfred Ern, Martin Kaufmann, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Reinhold Spang, Felix Ploeger, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 8389–8403, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8389-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8389-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents an analysis of temperature and the trace gases PAN and O3 in the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) region. The positive PAN anomaly consisting of polluted air is confined vertically within the main ASM anticyclone, whereas a recently shed eddy exhibits enhanced PAN VMRs for 1 to 2 km above the thermal tropopause. This implies that eddy shedding provides a very rapid horizontal transport pathway of Asian pollution into the extratropical lowermost stratosphere.\n\nTuning of a convective gravity wave source scheme based on HIRDLS observations\n\nQuang Thai Trinh, Silvio Kalisch, Peter Preusse, Manfred Ern, Hye-Yeong Chun, Stephen D. Eckermann, Min-Jee Kang, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 7335–7356, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7335-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-7335-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nConvection is an important source of atmospheric gravity waves (GWs). In this work, scales of convective GWs seen by limb sounders were first defined based on observed spectral information. Interactions of these waves with the background were considered. Long-scale convective GWs addressed by this approach showed significant importance in driving the QBO. Zonal mean of GW momentum flux and its vertical gradients are in good agreement with respective observations provided by limb sounders.\n\nDriving of the SAO by gravity waves as observed from satellite\n\nM. Ern, P. Preusse, and M. Riese\n\nAnn. Geophys., 33, 483–504, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-33-483-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-33-483-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe forcings of the semiannual oscillation (SAO) of the tropical zonal wind in the stratopause region are investigated based on ERA-Interim reanalysis and HIRDLS satellite observations. In particular, the SAO driving by mesoscale gravity waves is estimated directly from satellite observations of gravity waves. Our study confirms previous indirect evidence that planetary waves dominate during the westward driving of the SAO, while gravity waves mainly provide eastward forcing.\n\nA comprehensive observational filter for satellite infrared limb sounding of gravity waves\n\nQ.

Comparing CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) model data, we find that the model reproduces the measured enhanced NH3 within the Asian monsoon well but not that within biomass burning plumes, where no enhanced NH3 is measured in the upper troposphere but considerable amounts are simulated by CAMS.\n\nScale separation for gravity wave analysis from 3D temperature observations in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region\n\nBjÃ¶rn Linder, Peter Preusse, Qiuyu Chen, Ole Martin Christensen, Lukas Krasauskas, Linda Megner, Manfred Ern, and JÃ¶rg Gumbel\n\nAtmos.

These waves perturb the temperature field, and thus, by observing three-dimensional temperature fluctuations, their properties can be quantified. This pre-study uses synthetic MATS data generated from a general circulation model to investigate how well wave properties can be retrieved.\n\nGlobal scale gravity wave analysis methodology for the ESA Earth Explorer 11 candidate CAIRT\n\nSebastian Rhode, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Inna Polichtchouk, Kaoru Sato, Shingo Watanabe, Manfred Ern, Karlheinz Nogai, BjÃ¶rn-Martin Sinnhuber, and Martin Riese\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1084,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1084, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the capabilities of a proposed satellite mission, CAIRT, for observing gravity waves throughout the middle atmosphere and present the necessary methodology for in-depth wave analysis. Our findings suggest that such a satellite mission is highly capable of resolving individual wave parameters and could give new insights into the role of gravity waves in the general atmospheric circulation and atmospheric processes.\n\nObservation of horizontal temperature variations by a spatial heterodyne interferometer using single-sided interferograms\n\nKonstantin Ntokas, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Martin Kaufmann, Tom Neubert, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5681–5696, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5681-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5681-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA nanosatellite was developed to obtain 1-D vertical temperature profiles in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, which can be used to derive wave parameters needed for atmospheric models. A new processing method is shown, which allows one to extract two 1-D temperature profiles. The location of the two profiles is analyzed, as it is needed for deriving wave parameters. We show that this method is feasible, which however will increase the requirements of an accurate calibration and processing.\n\nThe SPARC water vapour assessment II: biases and drifts of water vapour satellite data records with respect to frost point hygrometer records\n\nMichael Kiefer, Dale F.

These comparisons of measurements during the period 2000–2016 are made using robust, consistent statistical methods. With some exceptions, the biases and drifts determined for most SAT–FP pairs are < 10 % and < 1 % yr−1.\n\nEmulating lateral gravity wave propagation in a global chemistryâclimate model (EMAC v2.55.2) through horizontal flux redistribution\n\nRoland Eichinger, Sebastian Rhode, Hella Garny, Peter Preusse, Petr Pisoft, AleÅ¡ KuchaÅ, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Astrid Kerkweg, and Bastian Kern\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 5561–5583, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5561-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5561-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe columnar approach of gravity wave (GW) schemes results in dynamical model biases, but parallel decomposition makes horizontal GW propagation computationally unfeasible. In the global model EMAC, we approximate it by GW redistribution at one altitude using tailor-made redistribution maps generated with a ray tracer. More spread-out GW drag helps reconcile the model with observations and close the 60°S GW gap. Polar vortex dynamics are improved, enhancing climate model credibility.\n\nThe quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and global-scale tropical waves in Aeolus wind observations, radiosonde data, and reanalyses\n\nManfred Ern, Mohamadou A. Diallo, Dina Khordakova, Isabell Krisch, Peter Preusse, Oliver Reitebuch, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9549–9583, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9549-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9549-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of the stratospheric tropical winds is an important mode of climate variability but is not well reproduced in free-running climate models. We use the novel global wind observations by the Aeolus satellite and radiosondes to show that the QBO is captured well in three modern reanalyses (ERA-5, JRA-55, and MERRA-2). Good agreement is also found also between Aeolus and reanalyses for large-scale tropical wave modes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.\n\nA mountain ridge model for quantifying oblique mountain wave propagation and distribution\n\nSebastian Rhode, Peter Preusse, Manfred Ern, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Lukas Krasauskas, Julio Bacmeister, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7901–7934, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7901-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7901-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGravity waves (GWs) transport energy vertically and horizontally within the atmosphere and thereby affect wind speeds far from their sources. Here, we present a model that identifies orographic GW sources and predicts the pathways of the excited GWs through the atmosphere for a better understanding of horizontal GW propagation. We use this model to explain physical patterns in satellite observations (e.g., low GW activity above the Himalaya) and predict seasonal patterns of GW propagation.\n\nSatellite observations of gravity wave momentum flux in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT): feasibility and requirements\n\nQiuyu Chen, Konstantin Ntokas, BjÃ¶rn Linder, Lukas Krasauskas, Manfred Ern, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Erich Becker, Martin Kaufmann, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 7071–7103, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7071-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7071-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nObservations of phase speed and direction spectra as well as zonal mean net gravity wave momentum flux are required to understand how gravity waves reach the mesosphere–lower thermosphere and how they there interact with background flow. To this end we propose flying two CubeSats, each deploying a spatial heterodyne spectrometer for limb observation of the airglow. End-to-end simulations demonstrate that individual gravity waves are retrieved faithfully for the expected instrument performance.\n\nIntermittency of gravity wave potential energies and absolute momentum fluxes derived from infrared limb sounding satellite observations\n\nManfred Ern, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 15093–15133, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15093-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15093-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on data from the HIRDLS and SABER infrared limb sounding satellite instruments, we investigate the intermittency of global distributions of gravity wave (GW) potential energies and GW momentum fluxes in the stratosphere and mesosphere using probability distribution functions (PDFs) and Gini coefficients. We compare GW intermittency in different regions, seasons, and altitudes. These results can help to improve GW parameterizations and the distributions of GWs resolved in models.\n\nStratospheric water vapour and ozone response to the quasi-biennial oscillation disruptions in 2016 and 2020\n\nMohamadou A. Diallo, Felix Ploeger, Michaela I. Hegglin, Manfred Ern, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Sergey Khaykin, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 14303–14321, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14303-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14303-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe quasi-biennial oacillation disruption events in both 2016 and 2020 decreased lower-stratospheric water vapour and ozone. Differences in the strength and depth of the anomalous lower-stratospheric circulation and ozone are due to differences in tropical upwelling and cold-point temperature induced by lower-stratospheric planetary and gravity wave breaking. The differences in water vapour are due to higher cold-point temperature in 2020 induced by Australian wildfire.\n\nThe SPARC Water Vapor Assessment II: assessment of satellite measurements of upper tropospheric humidity\n\nWilliam G. Read, Gabriele Stiller, Stefan Lossow, Michael Kiefer, Farahnaz Khosrawi, Dale Hurst, Holger VÃ¶mel, Karen Rosenlof, Bianca M. Dinelli, Piera Raspollini, Gerald E. Nedoluha, John C. Gille, Yasuko Kasai, Patrick Eriksson, Christopher E. Sioris, Kaley A. Walker, Katja Weigel, John P. Burrows, and Alexei Rozanov\n\nAtmos. Meas.

The instruments made their measurements from 1984 to the present time; however, most of these instruments began operations after 2000, and only a few are still operational. The objective of this study is to quantify the accuracy of each satellite humidity data set.\n\nThe MOPITT Version 9 CO product: sampling enhancements and validation\n\nMerritt Deeter, Gene Francis, John Gille, Debbie Mao, Sara MartÃ­nez-Alonso, Helen Worden, Dan Ziskin, James Drummond, RÃ³isÃ­n Commane, Glenn Diskin, and Kathryn McKain\n\nAtmos. Meas.

This paper describes the latest MOPITT data product, Version 9. Globally, the number of daytime MOPITT retrievals over land has increased by 30 %–40 % compared to the previous product. The reported improvements in the MOPITT product should benefit a wide variety of applications including studies of pollution sources.\n\nA case study of a ducted gravity wave event over northern Germany using simultaneous airglow imaging and wind-field observations\n\nSumanta Sarkhel, Gunter Stober, Jorge L. Chau, Steven M. Smith, Christoph Jacobi, Subarna Mondal, Martin G. Mlynczak, and James M. Russell III\n\nAnn. Geophys., 40, 179–190, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-179-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-179-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA rare gravity wave event was observed on the night of 25 April 2017 over northern Germany. An all-sky airglow imager recorded an upward-propagating wave at different altitudes in mesosphere with a prominent wave front above 91 km and faintly observed below. Based on wind and satellite-borne temperature profiles close to the event location, we have found the presence of a leaky thermal duct layer in 85–91 km. The appearance of this duct layer caused the wave amplitudes to diminish below 91 km.\n\nAssessment of the quality of ACE-FTS stratospheric ozone data\n\nPatrick E. Sheese, Kaley A. Walker, Chris D. Boone, Adam E. Bourassa, Doug A. Degenstein, Lucien Froidevaux, C. Thomas McElroy, Donal Murtagh, James M. Russell III, and Jiansheng Zou\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1233–1249, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1233-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1233-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study analyzes the quality of two versions (v3.6 and v4.1) of ozone concentration measurements from the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer), by comparing with data from five satellite instruments between 2004 and 2020. It was found that although the v3.6 data exhibit a better agreement than v4.1 with respect to the other instruments, v4.1 exhibits much better stability over time than v3.6. The stability of v4.1 makes it suitable for ozone trend studies.\n\nAnalysis of improvements in MOPITT observational coverage over Canada\n\nHeba S. Marey, James R. Drummond, Dylan B. A. Jones, Helen Worden, Merritt N. Deeter, John Gille, and Debbie Mao\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 701–719, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-701-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-701-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, an analysis has been performed to understand the improvements in observational coverage over Canada in the new MOPITT V9 product. Temporal and spatial analysis of V9 indicates a general coverage gain of 15–20 % relative to V8, which varies regionally and seasonally; e.g., the number of successful MOPITT retrievals in V9 was doubled over Canada in winter. Also, comparison with the corresponding IASI instrument indicated generally good agreement, with about a 5–10 % positive bias.\n\nA case study on the impact of severe convective storms on the water vapor mixing ratio in the lower mid-latitude stratosphere observed in 2019 over Europe\n\nDina Khordakova, Christian Rolf, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Paul Konopka, Andreas Wieser, Martina KrÃ¤mer, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1059–1079, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1059-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1059-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme storms transport humidity from the troposphere to the stratosphere. Here it has a strong impact on the climate. With ongoing global warming, we expect more storms and, hence, an enhancement of this effect. A case study was performed in order to measure the impact of the direct injection of water vapor into the lower stratosphere. The measurements displayed a significant transport of water vapor into the lower stratosphere, and this was supported by satellite and reanalysis data.\n\nPropagation paths and source distributions of resolved gravity waves in ECMWF-IFS analysis fields around the southern polar night jet\n\nCornelia Strube, Peter Preusse, Manfred Ern, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18641–18668, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18641-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18641-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh gravity wave (GW) momentum fluxes in the lower stratospheric southern polar vortex around 60° S are still poorly understood. Few GW sources are found at these latitudes. We present a ray tracing case study on waves resolved in high-resolution global model temperatures southeast of New Zealand. We show that lateral propagation of more than 1000 km takes place below 20 km altitude, and a variety of orographic and non-orographic sources located north of 50° S generate the wave field.\n\nGlobal balanced wind derived from SABER temperature and pressure observations and its validations\n\nXiao Liu, Jiyao Xu, Jia Yue, You Yu, Paulo P. Batista, Vania F. Andrioli, Zhengkuan Liu, Tao Yuan, Chi Wang, Ziming Zou, Guozhu Li, and James M. Russell III\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

The dataset agrees with the zonal wind from models (MERRA2, UARP, HWM14) and observations by meteor radar and lidar at seven stations. The dataset can be used to study seasonal and interannual variations and can serve as a background for wave studies of tides and planetary waves.\n\nThe semiannual oscillation (SAO) in the tropical middle atmosphere and its gravity wave driving in reanalyses and satellite observations\n\nManfred Ern, Mohamadou Diallo, Peter Preusse, Martin G. Mlynczak, Michael J. Schwartz, Qian Wu, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 13763–13795, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13763-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-13763-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetails of the driving of the semiannual oscillation (SAO) of the tropical winds in the middle atmosphere are still not known. We investigate the SAO and its driving by small-scale gravity waves (GWs) using satellite data and different reanalyses. In a large altitude range, GWs mainly drive the SAO westerlies, but in the upper mesosphere GWs seem to drive both SAO easterlies and westerlies. Reanalyses reproduce some features of the SAO but are limited by model-inherent damping at upper levels.\n\nOrographically induced spontaneous imbalance within the jet causing a large-scale gravity wave event\n\nMarkus Geldenhuys, Peter Preusse, Isabell Krisch, Christoph ZÃ¼licke, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Manfred Ern, Felix Friedl-Vallon, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 10393–10412, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10393-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10393-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA large-scale gravity wave (GW) was observed spanning the whole of Greenland. The GWs proposed in this paper come from a new jet–topography mechanism. The topography compresses the flow and triggers a change in u- and v-wind components. The jet becomes out of geostrophic balance and sheds energy in the form of GWs to restore the balance. This topography–jet interaction was not previously considered by the community, rendering the impact of the gravity waves largely unaccounted for.\n\n3-D tomographic observations of Rossby wave breaking over the North Atlantic during the WISE aircraft campaign in 2017\n\nLukas Krasauskas, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Peter Preusse, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Andreas Zahn, Helmut Ziereis, Christian Rolf, Felix PlÃ¶ger, Paul Konopka, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos.

Infrared limb sounding measurements of trace gases in the lower stratosphere, including high-resolution 3-D tomographic reconstruction, revealed complex spatial structures in stratospheric tracers near the polar jet related to previous RW breaking events. Backward-trajectory analysis and tracer correlations were used to study mixing and stratosphere–troposphere exchange.\n\nThe stratospheric BrewerâDobson circulation inferred from age of air in the ERA5 reanalysis\n\nFelix Ploeger, Mohamadou Diallo, Edward Charlesworth, Paul Konopka, Bernard Legras, Johannes C.

Phys., 21, 8393–8412, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8393-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8393-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the global stratospheric circulation (Brewer–Dobson circulation) in the new ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis based on age of air simulations, and we compare it to results from the preceding ERA-Interim reanalysis. Our results show a slower stratospheric circulation and higher age for ERA5. The age of air trend in ERA5 over the 1989–2018 period is negative throughout the stratosphere, related to multi-annual variability and a potential contribution from changes in the reanalysis system.\n\nThe advective BrewerâDobson circulation in the ERA5 reanalysis: climatology, variability, and trends\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Manfred Ern, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 7515–7544, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7515-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7515-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite good agreement in the spatial structure, there are substantial differences in the strength of the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) and its modulations in the UTLS and upper stratosphere. The tropical upwelling is generally weaker in ERA5 than in ERAI due to weaker planetary and gravity wave breaking in the UTLS. Analysis of the BDC trend shows an acceleration of the BDC of about 1.5 % decade-1 due to the long-term intensification in wave breaking, consistent with climate predictions.\n\nOverview and update of the SPARC Data Initiative: comparison of stratospheric composition measurements from satellite limb sounders\n\nMichaela I.

Data, 13, 1855–1903, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-1855-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-1855-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn overview of the SPARC Data Initiative is presented, to date the most comprehensive assessment of stratospheric composition measurements spanning 1979–2018. Measurements of 26 chemical constituents obtained from an international suite of space-based limb sounders were compiled into vertically resolved, zonal monthly mean time series. The quality and consistency of these gridded datasets are then evaluated using a climatological validation approach and a range of diagnostics.\n\nObservation of cirrus clouds with GLORIA during the WISE campaign: detection methods and cirrus characterization\n\nIrene Bartolome Garcia, Reinhold Spang, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Sabine Griessbach, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Michael HÃ¶pfner, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 3153–3168, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3153-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3153-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCirrus clouds contribute to the general radiation budget of the Earth. Measuring optically thin clouds is challenging but the IR limb sounder GLORIA possesses the necessary technical characteristics to make it possible. This study analyses data from the WISE campaign obtained with GLORIA. We developed a cloud detection method and derived characteristics of the observed cirrus-like cloud top, cloud bottom or position with respect to the tropopause.\n\nCirrus cloud shape detection by tomographic extinction retrievals from infrared limb emission sounder measurements\n\nJÃ¶rn Ungermann, Irene Bartolome, Sabine Griessbach, Reinhold Spang, Christian Rolf, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Michael HÃ¶pfner, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 7025–7045, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-7025-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-7025-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examines the potential of new IR limb imager instruments and tomographic methods for cloud detection purposes. Simple color-ratio-based methods are examined and compared against more involved nonlinear convex optimization. In a second part, 3-D measurements of the airborne limb sounder GLORIA taken during the Wave-driven ISentropic Exchange campaign are used to exemplarily derive the location and extent of small-scale cirrus clouds with high spatial accuracy.\n\nVariability of the BruntâVÃ¤isÃ¤lÃ¤ frequency at the OHâ-airglow layer height at low and midlatitudes\n\nSabine WÃ¼st, Michael Bittner, Jeng-Hwa Yee, Martin G. Mlynczak, and James M. Russell III\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 6067–6093, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-6067-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-6067-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith airglow spectrometers, the temperature in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere can be derived each night. The data allow to estimate the amount of energy which is transported by small-scale atmospheric waves, known as gravity waves. In order to do this, information about the BruntâVÃ¤isÃ¤lÃ¤ frequency and its evolution during the year is necessary. This is provided here for low and midlatitudes based on 18 years of satellite data.\n\nA microphysics guide to cirrus â Part 2: Climatologies of clouds and humidity from observations\n\nMartina KrÃ¤mer, Christian Rolf, Nicole Spelten, Armin Afchine, David Fahey, Eric Jensen, Sergey Khaykin, Thomas Kuhn, Paul Lawson, Alexey Lykov, Laura L. Pan, Martin Riese, Andrew Rollins, Fred Stroh, Troy Thornberry, Veronika Wolf, Sarah Woods, Peter Spichtinger, Johannes Quaas, and Odran Sourdeval\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 12569–12608, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-12569-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-12569-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo improve the representations of cirrus clouds in climate predictions, extended knowledge of their properties and geographical distribution is required. This study presents extensive airborne in situ and satellite remote sensing climatologies of cirrus and humidity, which serve as a guide to cirrus clouds. Further, exemplary radiative characteristics of cirrus types and also in situ observations of tropical tropopause layer cirrus and humidity in the Asian monsoon anticyclone are shown.\n\nSuperposition of gravity waves with different propagation characteristics observed by airborne and space-borne infrared sounders\n\nIsabell Krisch, Manfred Ern, Lars Hoffmann, Peter Preusse, Cornelia Strube, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Wolfgang Woiwode, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 11469–11490, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11469-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11469-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn 2016, a scientific research flight above Scandinavia acquired various atmospheric data (temperature, gas composition, etc.). Through advanced 3-D reconstruction methods, a superposition of multiple gravity waves was identified. An in-depth analysis enabled the characterisation of these waves as well as the identification of their sources. This work will enable a better understanding of atmosphere dynamics and could lead to improved climate projections.\n\nRemoving spurious inertial instability signals from gravity wave temperature perturbations using spectral filtering methods\n\nCornelia Strube, Manfred Ern, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 4927–4945, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4927-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4927-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present how inertial instabilities affect gravity wave background removal filters on different temperature data sets. Vertical filtering has to remove a part of the gravity wave spectrum to eliminate inertial instability remnants, while horizontal filtering leaves typical gravity wave scales untouched. In addition, we show that it is possible to separate inertial instabilities from gravity wave perturbations for infrared limb-sounding satellite profiles using a cutoff zonal wavenumber of 6.\n\nAÂ comparison of OH nightglow volume emission rates as measured by SCIAMACHY and SABER\n\nYajun Zhu, Martin Kaufmann, Qiuyu Chen, Jiyao Xu, Qiucheng Gong, Jilin Liu, Daikang Wei, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 3033–3042, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-3033-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-3033-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOH airglow emissions can be used to derive rotational temperature and trace constituents in the mesopause region, but systematic differences exist for the follow-up data using OH emission radiance as measured by SCIAMACHY and SABER. This paper makes a comparison of OH emission radiance as measured by them and shows the systematic differences between the two measurements. The radiometric calibration of the two instruments could potentially explain the differences between the two measurements.\n\nDehydration and low ozone in the tropopause layer over the Asian monsoon caused by tropical cyclones: Lagrangian transport calculations using ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalysis data\n\nDan Li, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Jianchun Bian, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Felix Ploeger, Qian Li, Jinqiang Zhang, Zhixuan Bai, Holger VÃ¶mel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 4133–4152, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4133-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4133-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLow ozone and low water vapour signatures in the UTLS were investigated using balloon-borne measurements and trajectory calculations. The results show that deep convection in tropical cyclones over the western Pacific transports boundary air parcels with low ozone into the tropopause region. Subsequently, these air parcels are dehydrated when passing the lowest temperature region (< 190 K) during quasi-horizontal advection.\n\nTechnical note: LIMS observations of lower stratospheric ozone in the southern polar springtime of 1978\n\nEllis Remsberg, V. Lynn Harvey, Arlin Krueger, Larry Gordley, John C. Gille, and James M. Russell III\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 3663–3668, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3663-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3663-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Nimbus 7 limb infrared monitor of the stratosphere (LIMS) instrument operated from October 25, 1978, through May 28, 1979. This note focuses on the lower stratosphere of the southern hemisphere, subpolar regions in relation to the position of the polar vortex. Both LIMS ozone and nitric acid show reductions within the edge of the polar vortex at 46 hPa near 60Â° S from late October through mid-November 1978, indicating that there was a chemical loss of Antarctic ozone some weeks earlier.\n\nAerosol and cloud top height information of Envisat MIPAS measurements\n\nSabine Griessbach, Lars Hoffmann, Reinhold Spang, Peggy Achtert, Marc von Hobe, Nina Mateshvili, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Martin Riese, Christian Rolf, Patric Seifert, and Jean-Paul Vernier\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 1243–1271, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-1243-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-1243-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we study the cloud top height derived from MIPAS measurements. Previous studies showed contradictory results with respect to MIPAS, both underestimating and overestimating cloud top height. We used simulations and found that overestimation and/or underestimation depend on cloud extinction. To support our findings we compared MIPAS cloud top heights of volcanic sulfate aerosol with measurements from CALIOP, ground-based lidar, and ground-based twilight measurements.\n\nThe efficiency of transport into the stratosphere via the Asian and North American summer monsoon circulations\n\nXiaolu Yan, Paul Konopka, Felix Ploeger, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, Jonathon S. Wright, Rolf MÃ¼ller, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 15629–15649, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15629-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15629-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Asian and North American summer monsoons (ASM and NASM) have considerable influence on stratospheric chemistry and physics. More air mass is transported from the monsoon regions to the tropical stratosphere when the tracers are released clearly below the tropopause than when they are released close to the tropopause. Results for different altitudes of air origin reveal two transport pathways (monsoon and tropical) from the upper troposphere over the monsoon regions to the tropical pipe.\n\nGlobal nighttime atomic oxygen abundances from GOMOS hydroxyl airglow measurements in the mesopause region\n\nQiuyu Chen, Martin Kaufmann, Yajun Zhu, Jilin Liu, Ralf Koppmann, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 13891–13910, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13891-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13891-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtomic oxygen is one of the most important trace species in the mesopause region. A common technique to derive it from satellite measurements is to measure airglow emissions involved in the photochemistry of oxygen. In this work, hydroxyl nightglow measured by the GOMOS instrument on Envisat is used to derive a 10-year dataset of atomic oxygen in the middle and upper atmosphere. Annual and semiannual oscillations are observed in the data. The new data are consistent with various other datasets.\n\nNitrification of the lowermost stratosphere during the exceptionally cold Arctic winter 2015â2016\n\nMarleen Braun, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Wolfgang Woiwode, SÃ¶ren Johansson, Michael HÃ¶pfner, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Hermann Oelhaf, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, BjÃ¶rn-Martin Sinnhuber, Helmut Ziereis, and Peter Braesicke\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 13681–13699, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13681-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13681-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse nitrification of the LMS in the Arctic winter 2015–2016 based on GLORIA measurements. Vertical cross sections of HNO3 for several flights show complex fineâscale structures and enhanced values down to 9 km. The extent of overall nitrification is quantified based on HNO3–O3 correlations and reaches between 5 ppbv and 7 ppbv at potential temperature levels between 350 and 380 K. Further, we compare our result with the atmospheric model CLaMS.\n\nEvidence of small-scale quasi-isentropic mixing in ridges of extratropical baroclinic waves\n\nDaniel Kunkel, Peter Hoor, Thorsten Kaluza, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, BjÃ¶rn Kluschat, Andreas Giez, Hans-Christoph Lachnitt, Martin Kaufmann, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 12607–12630, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-12607-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-12607-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we present a mixing process around the tropopause in extratropical baroclinic waves. We analyze airborne data from a flight during the WISE campaign in autumn 2017 over the North Atlantic. We use idealized experiments to study the mixing process. Although the process occurs on a small geographical scale, it might be of importance due to its relation to a frequent feature of the extratropical UTLS. The process is relevant for STE but is not fully included in climatologies.\n\nRadiance-based retrieval bias mitigation for the MOPITT instrument: the version 8 product\n\nMerritt N. Deeter, David P. Edwards, Gene L. Francis, John C. Gille, Debbie Mao, Sara MartÃ­nez-Alonso, Helen M. Worden, Dan Ziskin, and Meinrat O. Andreae\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 4561–4580, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-4561-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-4561-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere) satellite instrument has been making nearly continuous observations of atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) since 2000. MOPITT CO retrievals are routinely used to analyze emissions from fossil fuels and biomass burning, as well as the atmospheric transport of those emissions. This paper describes recent enhancements to the MOPITT retrieval algorithm. New validation results illustrate clear improvements in the fidelity of the MOPITT product.\n\nGlobal analysis for periodic variations in gravity wave squared amplitudes and momentum fluxes in the middle atmosphere\n\nDan Chen, Cornelia Strube, Manfred Ern, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAnn. Geophys., 37, 487–506, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-487-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-487-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, for the first time, absolute gravity wave momentum flux (GWMF) on temporal scales from terannual variation up to solar cycle length is investigated. The systematic spectral analysis of SABER absolute GWMF is presented and physically interpreted. The various roles of filtering and oblique propagating are discussed, which is likely an important factor for MLT dynamics, and hence can be used as a stringent test bed of the reproduction of such features in global models.\n\nTropospheric mixing and parametrization of unresolved convective updrafts as implemented in the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS v2.0)\n\nPaul Konopka, Mengchu Tao, Felix Ploeger, Mohamadou Diallo, and Martin Riese\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 2441–2462, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2441-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2441-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCLaMS is a Lagrangian transport model suitable for simulating atmospheric transport and chemistry. The novel approach of CLaMS is its description of atmospheric mixing. Whereas the common approach is to minimize the numerical diffusion ever present in the modeling of transport, CLaMS is a first attempt to apply this undesirable disturbing effect to parametrize the true physical mixing. In this paper, we show how this concept works both in the stratosphere and in the troposphere.\n\nValidation of Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) nitric oxide measurements\n\nMark E. Hervig, Benjamin T. Marshall, Scott M. Bailey, David E. Siskind, James M. Russell III, Charles G. Bardeen, Kaley A. Walker, and Bernd Funke\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 3111–3121, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-3111-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-3111-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) has measured nitric oxide (NO) from satellite since 2007. The observations are validated through error analysis and comparisons with other satellite observations. Calculated SOFIE NO uncertainties are less than 50 % for altitudes from 40 to 140 km. SOFIE agrees with other measurements to within 50 % for altitudes from roughly 50 to 105 km for spacecraft sunrise and 50 to 140 km for sunsets.\n\nObservations of OH airglow from ground, aircraft, and satellite: investigation of wave-like structures before a minor stratospheric warming\n\nSabine WÃ¼st, Carsten Schmidt, Patrick Hannawald, Michael Bittner, Martin G. Mlynczak, and James M. Russell III\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 6401–6418, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6401-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6401-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn winter 2016, the camera system FAIM derived information about the OH* airglow at ca. 86 km height during six flights on board the research aircraft FALCON in northern Scandinavia. Coincident ground- and satellite-based measurements (GRIPS and TIMED-SABER) complete the data set. The data are analysed with respect to the temporal and spatial evolution of small-scale atmospheric dynamics just before a minor stratospheric warming. Special emphasis is placed on possible instability features.\n\nMultitimescale variations in modeled stratospheric water vapor derived from three modern reanalysis products\n\nMengchu Tao, Paul Konopka, Felix Ploeger, Xiaolu Yan, Jonathon S. Wright, Mohamadou Diallo, Stephan Fueglistaler, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 6509–6534, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6509-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6509-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper examines the annual and interannual variations as well as long-term trend of modeled stratospheric water vapor with a Lagrangian chemical transport model driven by ERA-I, MERRA-2 and JRA-55. We find reasonable consistency among the annual cycle, QBO and the variabilities induced by ENSO and volcanic aerosols. The main discrepancies are linked to the differences in reanalysis upwelling rates in the lower stratosphere. The trends are sensitive to the reanalyses that drives the model.\n\nThe SPARC water vapour assessment II: profile-to-profile comparisons of stratospheric and lower mesospheric water vapour data sets obtained from satellites\n\nStefan Lossow, Farahnaz Khosrawi, Michael Kiefer, Kaley A. Walker, Jean-Loup Bertaux, Laurent Blanot, James M. Russell, Ellis E. Remsberg, John C. Gille, Takafumi Sugita, Christopher E. Sioris, Bianca M.

Stiller\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 6007–6034, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6007-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6007-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe identified the transport pathways of air masses from the region of the Asian monsoon (e.g. pollution and greenhouse gases caused by increasing population and growing industries in Asia) into the lower stratosphere. Even small changes of the chemical composition of the lower stratosphere have an impact on surface climate (e.g. surface temperatures). Therefore, it is important to identify transport pathways to the stratosphere to allow potential environmental risks to be assessed.\n\nHow robust are stratospheric age of air trends from different reanalyses?\n\nFelix Ploeger, Bernard Legras, Edward Charlesworth, Xiaolu Yan, Mohamadou Diallo, Paul Konopka, Thomas Birner, Mengchu Tao, Andreas Engel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 6085–6105, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6085-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-6085-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse the change in the circulation of the middle atmosphere based on current generation meteorological reanalysis data sets. We find that long-term changes from 1989 to 2015 are similar for the chosen reanalyses, mainly resembling the forced response in climate model simulations to climate change. For shorter periods circulation changes are less robust, and the representation of decadal variability appears to be a major uncertainty for modelling the circulation of the middle atmosphere.\n\nSampling bias adjustment for sparsely sampled satellite measurements applied to ACE-FTS carbonyl sulfide observations\n\nCorinna Kloss, Marc von Hobe, Michael HÃ¶pfner, Kaley A. Walker, Martin Riese, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Birgit Hassler, Stefanie Kremser, and Greg E. Bodeker\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 2129–2138, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2129-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2129-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAre regional and seasonal averages from only a few satellite measurements, all aligned along a specific path, representative? Probably not. We present a method to adjust for the so-called sampling bias and investigate its influence on derived long-term trends. The method is illustrated and validated for a long-lived trace gas (carbonyl sulfide), and it is shown that the influence of the sampling bias is too small to change scientific conclusions on long-term trends.\n\nModel results of OH airglow considering four different wavelength regions to derive night-time atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen in the mesopause region\n\nTilo Fytterer, Christian von Savigny, Martin Mlynczak, and Miriam Sinnhuber\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 1835–1851, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-1835-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-1835-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA model was developed to derive night-time atomic oxygen (O(3P)) and atomic hydrogen (H) from satellite observations in the altitude region between 75 km and 100 km. Comparisons between the best-fit model and the measurements suggest that chemical reactions involving O2 and O(3P) might occur differently than is usually assumed in literature. This considerably affects the derived abundances of O(3P) and H, which in turn might influence air temperature and winds of the whole atmosphere.\n\n3-D tomographic limb sounder retrieval techniques: irregular grids and Laplacian regularisation\n\nLukas Krasauskas, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Stefan Ensmann, Isabell Krisch, Erik Kretschmer, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 853–872, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-853-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-853-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany limb sounder measurements from the same atmospheric region taken at different angles can be combined into a 3-D tomographic image of the atmosphere. Mathematically, this is a complex, computationally expensive, underdetermined problem that needs additional constraints (regularisation). We introduce an improved regularisation method based on physical properties of the atmosphere with a new irregular grid implementation. Simulated data tests show improved results and lower computational cost.\n\nOn the relative roles of dynamics and chemistry governing the abundance and diurnal variation of low-latitude thermospheric nitric oxide\n\nDavid E. Siskind, McArthur Jones Jr., Douglas P. Drob, John P. McCormack, Mark E. Hervig, Daniel R. Marsh, Martin G. Mlynczak, Scott M. Bailey, Astrid Maute, and Nicholas J. Mitchell\n\nAnn. Geophys., 37, 37–48, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-37-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-37-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use data from two NASA satellites and a general circulation model of the upper atmosphere to elucidate the key factors governing the abundance and diurnal variation of nitric oxide (NO) at near-solar minimum conditions and low latitudes. This has been difficult to do previously, because NO data are typically taken from satellites in sun-synchronous orbits, meaning that they only acquire data in fixed local times. We overcome this limitation through model simulations of the NO diurnal cycle.\n\nLagrangian simulation of ice particles and resulting dehydration in the polar winter stratosphere\n\nInes Tritscher, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Reinhold Spang, Michael C. Pitts, Lamont R. Poole, Rolf MÃ¼ller, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 543–563, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-543-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-543-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present Lagrangian simulations of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) for the Arctic winter 2009/2010 and the Antarctic winter 2011 using the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). The paper comprises a detailed model description with ice PSCs and related dehydration being the focus of this study. Comparisons between our simulations and observations from different satellites on season-long and vortex-wide scales as well as for single PSC events show an overall good agreement.\n\nStructural changes in the shallow and transition branch of the BrewerâDobson circulation induced by El NiÃ±o\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Paul Konopka, Michelle L. Santee, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Mengchu Tao, Kaley A. Walker, Bernard Legras, Martin Riese, Manfred Ern, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 425–446, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-425-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-425-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper assesses the structural changes in the shallow and transition branches of the BDC induced by El Nino using the Lagrangian model simulations driven by ERAi and JRA-55 combined with MLS observations. We found a clear evidence of a weakening of the transition branch due to an upward shift in the dissipation height of the planetary and gravity waves and a strengthening of the shallow branch due to enhanced GW breaking in the tropics–subtropics and PW breaking at high latitudes.\n\nHigh tropospheric ozone in Lhasa within the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone in 2013: influence of convective transport and stratospheric intrusions\n\nDan Li, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Jianchun Bian, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Qian Li, Jinqiang Zhang, Zhixuan Bai, Holger VÃ¶mel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17979–17994, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17979-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17979-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBalloon-borne measurements performed over Lhasa in August 2013 are investigated using CLaMS trajectory calculations. Here, we focus on high ozone mixing ratios in the free troposphere. Our findings demonstrate that both stratospheric intrusions and convective transport of air pollution play a major role in enhancing middle and upper tropospheric ozone.\n\nMesoscale fine structure of a tropopause fold over mountains\n\nWolfgang Woiwode, Andreas DÃ¶rnbrack, Martina Bramberger, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Florian Haenel, Michael HÃ¶pfner, SÃ¶ren Johansson, Erik Kretschmer, Isabell Krisch, Thomas Latzko, Hermann Oelhaf, Johannes Orphal, Peter Preusse, BjÃ¶rn-Martin Sinnhuber, and JÃ¶rn Ungermann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 15643–15667, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-15643-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-15643-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGLORIA observations during two crossings of the polar front jet stream resolve the fine mesoscale structure of a tropopause fold in high detail. Tracer–tracer correlations of H2O and O3 are presented as a function of potential temperature and reveal an active mixing region. Our study confirms conceptual models of tropopause folds, validates the high quality of ECMWF IFS forecasts, and suggests that mountain waves are capable of modulating exchange processes in the vicinity of tropopause folds.\n\nResponse of stratospheric water vapor and ozone to the unusual timing of El NiÃ±o and the QBO disruption in 2015â2016\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Martin Riese, Thomas Birner, Paul Konopka, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Michaela I. Hegglin, Michelle L. Santee, Mark Baldwin, Bernard Legras, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 13055–13073, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13055-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13055-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe unprecedented timing of an El NiÃ±o event aligned with the disrupted QBO in 2015–2016 caused a perturbation to the stratospheric circulation, affecting trace gases. This paper resolves the puzzling response of the lower stratospheric water vapor by showing that the QBO disruption reversed the lower stratosphere moistening triggered by the alignment of the El NiÃ±o event with a westerly QBO in early boreal winter.\n\nAirborne limb-imaging measurements of temperature, HNO3, O3, ClONO2, H2O and CFC-12 during the Arctic winter 2015/2016: characterization, inÂ situ validation and comparison to Aura/MLS\n\nSÃ¶ren Johansson, Wolfgang Woiwode, Michael HÃ¶pfner, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Anne Kleinert, Erik Kretschmer, Thomas Latzko, Johannes Orphal, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Michelle L. Santee, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Andreas Marsing, Christiane Voigt, Andreas Giez, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Christian Rolf, Andreas Zahn, Andreas Engel, BjÃ¶rn-Martin Sinnhuber, and Hermann Oelhaf\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 4737–4756, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4737-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4737-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present two-dimensional cross sections of temperature, HNO3, O3, ClONO2, H2O and CFC-12 from measurements of the GLORIA infrared limb imager during the POLSTRACC/GW-LCYCLE/SALSA aircraft campaigns in the Arctic winter 2015/2016. GLORIA sounded the atmosphere between 5 and 14 km with vertical resolutions of 0.4–1 km. Estimated errors are in the range of 1–2 K (temperature) and 10 %–20 % (trace gases). Comparisons to in situ instruments onboard the aircraft and to Aura/MLS are shown.\n\nThe SPARC water vapour assessment II: comparison of stratospheric and lower mesospheric water vapour time series observed from satellites\n\nFarahnaz Khosrawi, Stefan Lossow, Gabriele P. Stiller, Karen H. Rosenlof, Joachim Urban, John P. Burrows, Robert P. Damadeo, Patrick Eriksson, Maya GarcÃ­a-Comas, John C. Gille, Yasuko Kasai, Michael Kiefer, Gerald E. Nedoluha, Stefan NoÃ«l, Piera Raspollini, William G. Read, Alexei Rozanov, Christopher E. Sioris, Kaley A. Walker, and Katja Weigel\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 4435–4463, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4435-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4435-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTime series of stratospheric and lower mesospheric water vapour using 33 data sets from 15 satellite instruments were compared in the framework of the second SPARC water vapour assessment. We find that most data sets can be considered in observational and modelling studies addressing, e.g. stratospheric and lower mesospheric water vapour variability and trends if data-set-specific characteristics (e.g. a drift) and restrictions (e.g. temporal and spatial coverage) are taken into account.\n\nLimited angle tomography of mesoscale gravity waves by the infrared limb-sounder GLORIA\n\nIsabell Krisch, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Peter Preusse, Erik Kretschmer, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 4327–4344, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4327-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4327-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThree-dimensional temperature measurements of the atmosphere are required to address current research questions concerning the propagation of gravity waves. Limited angle tomography (LAT) with measurements from an airborne infrared limb imager can provide such 3-D temperature measurements. Wave parameters derived from such LAT measurements achieve an accuracy similar to that derived from full angle tomography, if the orientation of the flight path is optimized with respect to the gravity wave.\n\nIce particle sampling from aircraft â influence of the probing position on the ice water content\n\nArmin Afchine, Christian Rolf, Anja Costa, Nicole Spelten, Martin Riese, Bernhard Buchholz, Volker Ebert, Romy Heller, Stefan Kaufmann, Andreas Minikin, Christiane Voigt, Martin ZÃ¶ger, Jessica Smith, Paul Lawson, Alexey Lykov, Sergey Khaykin, and Martina KrÃ¤mer\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 4015–4031, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4015-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-4015-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ice water content (IWC) of cirrus clouds is an essential parameter that determines their radiative properties and is thus important for climate simulations. Experimental investigations of IWCs measured on board research aircraft reveal that their accuracy is influenced by the sampling position. IWCs detected at the aircraft roof deviate significantly from wing, side or bottom IWCs. The reasons are deflections of the gas streamlines and ice particle trajectories behind the aircraft cockpit.\n\nA highly miniaturized satellite payload based on a spatial heterodyne spectrometer for atmospheric temperature measurements in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere\n\nMartin Kaufmann, Friedhelm Olschewski, Klaus Mantel, Brian Solheim, Gordon Shepherd, Michael Deiml, Jilin Liu, Rui Song, Qiuyu Chen, Oliver Wroblowski, Daikang Wei, Yajun Zhu, Friedrich Wagner, Florian Loosen, Denis Froehlich, Tom Neubert, Heinz Rongen, Peter Knieling, Panos Toumpas, Jinjun Shan, Geshi Tang, Ralf Koppmann, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 3861–3870, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-3861-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-3861-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe concept and optical layout of a limb sounder using a spatial heterodyne spectrometer is presented. The instrument fits onto a nano-satellite platform, such as a CubeSat. It is designed for the derivation of temperatures in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The design parameters of the optics and a radiometric assessment of the instrument as well as the main characterization and calibration steps are discussed.\n\nSensitivities of modelled water vapour in the lower stratosphere: temperature uncertainty, effects of horizontal transport and small-scale mixing\n\nLiubov Poshyvailo, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Paul Konopka, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Martin Riese, AurÃ©lien Podglajen, and Felix Ploeger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 8505–8527, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8505-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8505-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater vapour (H2O) in the UTLS is a key player for global radiation, which is critical for predictions of future climate change. We investigate the effects of current uncertainties in tropopause temperature, horizontal transport and small-scale mixing on simulated H2O, using the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere. Our sensitivity studies provide new insights into the leading processes controlling stratospheric H2O, important for assessing and improving climate model projections.\n\nTrend differences in lower stratospheric water vapour between Boulder and the zonal mean and their role in understanding fundamental observational discrepancies\n\nStefan Lossow, Dale F. Hurst, Karen H. Rosenlof, Gabriele P. Stiller, Thomas von Clarmann, Sabine Brinkop, Martin Dameris, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Doug E. Kinnison, Johannes Plieninger, David A. Plummer, Felix Ploeger, William G. Read, Ellis E. Remsberg, James M. Russell, and Mengchu Tao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 8331–8351, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8331-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8331-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTrend estimates of lower stratospheric H2O derived from the FPH observations at Boulder and a merged zonal mean satellite data set clearly differ for the time period from the late 1980s to 2010. We investigate if a sampling bias between Boulder and the zonal mean around the Boulder latitude can explain these trend discrepancies. Typically they are small and not sufficient to explain the trend discrepancies in the observational database.\n\nEl NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation influence on the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone\n\nXiaolu Yan, Paul Konopka, Felix Ploeger, Mengchu Tao, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Michelle L. Santee, Jianchun Bian, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 8079–8096, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8079-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8079-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany works investigate the impact of ENSO on the troposphere. However, only a few works check the impact of ENSO at higher altitudes. Here, we analyse the impact of ENSO on the vicinity of the tropopause using reanalysis, satellite, in situ and model data. We find that ENSO shows the strongest signal in winter, but its impact can last until early the next summer. The ENSO anomaly is insignificant in late summer. Our study can help to understand the atmosphere propagation after ENSO.\n\nThree-dimensional tomographic reconstruction of atmospheric gravity waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)\n\nRui Song, Martin Kaufmann, Manfred Ern, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Guang Liu, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 3161–3175, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-3161-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-3161-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new observation strategy, called sweep mode, for a real three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction of gravity waves in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by modifying the observation geometry of conventional limb-sounding measurements. It enhances the horizontal resolution that typical limb sounders can achieve while at the same time retaining the good vertical resolution they have.\n\nDerivation of gravity wave intrinsic parameters and vertical wavelength using a single scanning OH(3-1) airglow spectrometer\n\nSabine WÃ¼st, Thomas Offenwanger, Carsten Schmidt, Michael Bittner, Christoph Jacobi, Gunter Stober, Jeng-Hwa Yee, Martin G. Mlynczak, and James M. Russell III\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 2937–2947, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-2937-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-2937-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOH*-spectrometer measurements allow the analysis of gravity wave ground-based periods, but spatial information cannot necessarily be deduced. We combine the approach of Wachter at al. (2015) in order to derive horizontal wavelengths (but based on only one OH* spectrometer) with additional information about wind and temperature and compute vertical wavelengths. Knowledge of these parameters is a precondition for the calculation of further information such as the wave group velocity.\n\nOn the origin of the mesospheric quasi-stationary planetary waves in the unusual Arctic winterÂ 2015/2016\n\nVivien Matthias and Manfred Ern\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 4803–4815, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-4803-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-4803-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe aim of this study is to find the origin of mesospheric stationary planetary wave (SPW) in the subtropics and in mid and polar latitudes in mid winter 2015/2016. Our results based on observations show that upward propagating SPW and in situ generated SPWs by longitudinally variable gravity wave drag and by instabilities can be responsible for the occurrence of mesospheric SPWs and that they can act at the same time, which confirms earlier model studies.\n\nSatellite observations of middle atmosphereâthermosphere vertical coupling by gravity waves\n\nQuang Thai Trinh, Manfred Ern, Eelco Doornbos, Peter Preusse, and Martin Riese\n\nAnn. Geophys., 36, 425–444, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-425-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-425-2018, 2018\n\nWater vapor increase in the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere due to the Asian monsoon anticyclone observed during the TACTS/ESMVal campaigns\n\nChristian Rolf, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Peter Hoor, Armin Afchine, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Stefan MÃ¼ller, Nicole Spelten, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 2973–2983, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-2973-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-2973-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Asian monsoon is a pronounced circulation system linked to rapid vertical transport of surface air from India and east Asia in the summer months. We found, based on aircraft measurements, higher concentration of water vapor in the lowermost stratosphere caused by the Asian monsoon. Enrichment of water vapor concentrations in the lowermost stratosphere impacts the radiation budget and thus climate. Understanding those variations in water vapor is important for climate projections.\n\nUniversal power law of the gravity wave manifestation in the AIM CIPS polar mesospheric cloud images\n\nPingping Rong, Jia Yue, James M. Russell III, David E. Siskind, and Cora E. Randall\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 883–899, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-883-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-883-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is a massive manifestation of atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) in polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) at the summer mesopause, which serves as indicators of the atmospheric dynamics and climate change. We obtained a universal power law that governs the GW display morphology and clarity level throughout the wave population residing in PMCs. Higher clarity refers to more distinct exhibition of the features. A GW tracking algorithm is used to identify the waves and to sort the albedo power.\n\nIntercomparison of AIRS and HIRDLS stratospheric gravity wave observations\n\nCatrin I. Meyer, Manfred Ern, Lars Hoffmann, Quang Thai Trinh, and M. Joan Alexander\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 215–232, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-215-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-215-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate stratospheric gravity wave observations by the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS). Waves seen by AIRS contribute significantly to momentum flux, which indicates a calculated momentum flux factor. AIRS and HIRDLS agree well in the phase structure of the wave events and also in the seasonal and latitudinal patterns of gravity wave activity and can be used complementary to each other.\n\nFirst tomographic observations of gravity waves by the infrared limb imager GLORIA\n\nIsabell Krisch, Peter Preusse, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Andreas DÃ¶rnbrack, Stephen D. Eckermann, Manfred Ern, Felix Friedl-Vallon, Martin Kaufmann, Hermann Oelhaf, Markus Rapp, Cornelia Strube, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 14937–14953, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-14937-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-14937-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing the infrared limb imager GLORIA, the 3-D structure of mesoscale gravity waves in the lower stratosphere was measured for the first time, allowing for a complete 3-D characterization of the waves. This enables the precise determination of the sources of the waves in the mountain regions of Iceland with backward ray tracing. Forward ray tracing shows oblique propagation, an effect generally neglected in global atmospheric models.\n\nVariability of the BruntâVÃ¤isÃ¤lÃ¤ frequency at the OH* layer height\n\nSabine WÃ¼st, Michael Bittner, Jeng-Hwa Yee, Martin G. Mlynczak, and James M. Russell III\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 4895–4903, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-4895-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-4895-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the Alpine region, the most dense subnetwork of identical NDMC (Network for the Detection of Mesospheric Change) instruments can be found. With these instruments the mesopause temperature is derived each night. The data can be used for the investigation of the amount of energy which is transported by small-scale atmospheric waves, known as gravity waves, provided that the so-called Brunt–Väisälä frequency is known. Information about the variability of this parameter is provided here.\n\nTomographic reconstruction of atmospheric gravity wave parameters from airglow observations\n\nRui Song, Martin Kaufmann, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Manfred Ern, Guang Liu, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 4601–4612, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-4601-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-4601-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGravity waves (GWs) play an important role in atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we propose a new observation strategy for GWs in the mesopause region by combining limb and sub-limb satellite-borne remote sensing measurements for improving the spatial resolution of temperatures that are retrieved from atmospheric soundings. It shows that one major advantage of this observation strategy is that much smaller-scale GWs can be observed.\n\nShift of subtropical transport barriers explains observed hemispheric asymmetry of decadal trends of age of air\n\nGabriele P. Stiller, Federico Fierli, Felix Ploeger, Chiara Cagnazzo, Bernd Funke, Florian J. Haenel, Thomas Reddmann, Martin Riese, and Thomas von Clarmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 11177–11192, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-11177-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-11177-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe discrepancy between modelled and observed 25-year trends of the strength of the stratospheric Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) is still not resolved. With our paper we trace the observed hemispheric dipole structure of age of air trends back to natural variability in shorter-term (decadal) time frames. Beyond this we demonstrate that after correction for the decadal natural variability the remaining trend for the first decade of the 21st century is consistent with model simulations.\n\nResolving the mesospheric nighttime 4.3 Âµm emission puzzle: comparison of the CO2(Î½3) and OH(Î½) emission models\n\nPeter A. Panka, Alexander A. Kutepov, Konstantinos S. Kalogerakis, Diego Janches, James M. Russell, Ladislav Rezac, Artem G. Feofilov, Martin G. Mlynczak, and Erdal YiÄit\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 9751–9760, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-9751-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-9751-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecently, theoretical and laboratory studies have suggested an additional nighttime channel of transfer of vibrational energy of OH molecules to CO2 in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). We show that new mechanism brings modelled 4.3 Î¼m emissions very close to the SABER/TIMED measurements. This renders new opportunities for the application of the CO2 4.3 Î¼m observations in the study of the energetics and dynamics of the nighttime MLT.\n\nA climate-scale satellite record for carbon monoxide: the MOPITT Version 7 product\n\nMerritt N. Deeter, David P. Edwards, Gene L. Francis, John C. Gille, Sara MartÃ­nez-Alonso, Helen M. Worden, and Colm Sweeney\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 2533–2555, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-2533-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-2533-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis manuscript describes the methods used for deriving the latest version 7 product for atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) from measurements made by the MOPITT (Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere) satellite instrument. Comparisons of MOPITT-retrieved CO vertical profiles with in situ data measured from aircraft are also presented, and they demonstrate clear improvements relative to earlier MOPITT products. The new CO product is appropriate for a wide variety of applications.\n\nQuantifying pollution transport from the Asian monsoon anticyclone into the lower stratosphere\n\nFelix Ploeger, Paul Konopka, Kaley Walker, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 7055–7066, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7055-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7055-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPollution transport from the surface to the stratosphere within the Asian summer monsoon circulation may cause harmful effects on stratospheric chemistry and climate. We investigate air mass transport from the monsoon anticyclone into the stratosphere, combining model simulations with satellite trace gas measurements. We show evidence for two transport pathways from the monsoon: (i) into the tropical stratosphere and (ii) into the Northern Hemisphere extratropical lower stratosphere.\n\nValidation of MOPITT carbon monoxide using ground-based Fourier transform infrared spectrometer data from NDACC\n\nRebecca R. Buchholz, Merritt N. Deeter, Helen M. Worden, John Gille, David P. Edwards, James W. Hannigan, Nicholas B. Jones, Clare Paton-Walsh, David W. T. Griffith, Dan Smale, John Robinson, Kimberly Strong, Stephanie Conway, Ralf Sussmann, Frank Hase, Thomas Blumenstock, Emmanuel Mahieu, and Bavo Langerock\n\nAtmos. Meas.

MOPITT generally shows low bias with respect to the ground-based instruments. The geographic and temporal dependence of validation results are determined. Our findings inform some recommendations for using MOPITT measurements.\n\nThe SPARC water vapour assessment II: comparison of annual, semi-annual and quasi-biennial variations in stratospheric and lower mesospheric water vapour observed from satellites\n\nStefan Lossow, Farahnaz Khosrawi, Gerald E.

Global simulations with the CLaMS model demonstrate that source regions in Asia and in the Pacific Ocean have a significant impact on the chemical composition of the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere by flooding the extratropical lower stratosphere with young moist air masses. Two main horizontal transport pathways from the Asian monsoon anticyclone are identified.\n\nValidation of ACE-FTS version 3.5 NOy species profiles using correlative satellite measurements\n\nPatrick E.
