        "meta_description": "Abstract. Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands were hit by extreme\nprecipitation and flooding in July 2021. This brief communication provides\nan overview of the impacts to large-scale critical infrastructure systems\nand how recovery has progressed. The results show that Germany and Belgium\nwere particularly affected, with many infrastructure assets severely damaged\nor completely destroyed. Impacts range from completely destroyed bridges and\nsewage systems, to severely damaged schools and hospitals. We find that\n(large-scale) risk assessments, often focused on larger (river) flood\nevents, do not find these local, but severe, impacts due to critical\ninfrastructure failures. This may be the result of limited availability of\nvalidation material. As such, this brief communication not only will help to\nbetter understand how critical infrastructure can be affected by flooding,\nbut also can be used as validation material for future flood risk\nassessments.",

We find that sea level rise can quadruple coastal flood volumes, while changes in Sandy's landfall location can double flood volumes. Our results show the need for diverse scenarios that include climate change and internal variability and for integrating climate information into a modelling framework, offering insights for high-impact event assessments.\n\nSystem vulnerability to flood events and risk assessment of railway systems based on national and river basin scales in China\n\nWeihua Zhu, Kai Liu, Ming Wang, Philip J.

To do so, we develop a method for generating flood events at both the national and river basin scale. Results show flood system vulnerability and risk of the railway system are spatially heterogeneous. The event-based approach shows how we can identify critical hotspots, taking the first steps in developing climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\nInvited perspectives: A research agenda towards disaster risk management pathways in multi-(hazard-)risk assessment\n\nPhilip J.

In the international research and policy community it is recognised that risk management could benefit from a more systemic approach. In this perspective paper, we argue for an approach that addresses multi-hazard, multi-risk management through the lens of sustainability challenges that cut across sectors, regions, and hazards.\n\nHow to use empirical data to improve transportation infrastructure risk assessment\n\nWeihua Zhu, Kai Liu, Ming Wang, Sadhana Nirandjan, and Elco Koks\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-277,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-277, 2021\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use multi-source empirical damage data to generate vulnerability curves and assess the risk of transportation infrastructure to rainfall-induced hazards. The results show large variations in the shape of the vulnerability curves and risk of railway infrastructure in China across the different regions. The usage of multi-source empirical data offer opportunities to perform risk assessments that include spatial detail among regions.\n\nFlood risk assessment of the European road network\n\nKees C. H. van Ginkel, Francesco Dottori, Lorenzo Alfieri, Luc Feyen, and Elco E. Koks\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1011–1027, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1011-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1011-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents a state-of-the-art approach to assess flood damage for each unique road segment in Europe. We find a mean total flood risk of EUR 230 million per year for all individual road segments combined. We identify flood hotspots in the Alps, along the Sava River, and on the Scandinavian Peninsula. To achieve this, we propose a new set of damage curves for roads and challenge the community to validate and improve these. Analysis of network effects can be easily added to our analysis.\n\nBuilding Asset Value Mapping in Support of Flood Risk Assessment: A Case Study of Shanghai, China\n\nJidong Wu, Xu Wang, and Elco Koks\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

This paper introduces an efficient way for building asset value mapping by downscaling, given that the statistical building floor area and a building footprint map are available. It is expected that the method used in this paper is transferable to be applied in other cities if the two datasets are all available.\n\nRegional disaster impact analysis: comparing inputâoutput and computable general equilibrium models\n\nElco E. Koks, Lorenzo Carrera, Olaf Jonkeren, Jeroen C. J. H. Aerts, Trond G. Husby, Mark Thissen, Gabriele Standardi, and Jaroslav Mysiak\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Modelling results indicate that the difference in estimated total (national) economic losses and the regional distribution of those losses may vary by up to a factor of 7 between the three models, depending on the type of recovery path. Total economic impact is negative in all models though.\n\nIncreasing flood exposure in the Netherlands: implications for risk financing\n\nB. Jongman, E. E. Koks, T. G. Husby, and P. J. Ward\n\nNat.

It is designed to give an authoritative estimate of global warming to date and its causes. We find that in 2023, global warming reached 1.3 °C and is increasing at over 0.2 °C per decade. This is caused by all-time-high greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nReview article: Physical Vulnerability Database for Critical Infrastructure Multi-Hazard Risk Assessments – A systematic review and data collection\n\nSadhana Nirandjan, Elco E.

The development of three sets of gridded data (historical open burning, historical anthropogenic, and future scenarios) was coordinated to produce consistent data over 1750–2100. We discuss the methodologies used to produce these data along with limitations and potential for future work.\n\nThe impacts of recent drought on fire, forest loss, and regional smoke emissions in lowland Bolivia\n\nJoshua P. Heyer, Mitchell J. Power, Robert D. Field, and Margreet J. E. van Marle\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 4317–4331, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4317-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4317-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA variety of data were explored to better understand relationships among climate, fire, smoke emissions, and human land use in lowland Bolivia. Paleosedimentary work and modern fire records have linked drought to fire in the southern Amazon. From 2000 to 2015, our results indicate drought was the dominant control on wildfire in lowland Bolivia and in Noel Kempff Mercado National Park. Note that fire was most common in the Cerrado and seasonally inundated wetland biomes.\n\nGlobal fire emissions estimates during 1997â2016\n\nGuido R. van der Werf, James T.

We have estimated how much area they burn globally and what their emissions are. Total burned area is roughly equivalent to the size of the EU with most fires burning in tropical savannas. Their emissions vary substantially from year to year and contribute to the atmospheric burdens of many trace gases and aerosols. The 20-year dataset is mostly suited for large-scale assessments.\n\nHistoric global biomass burning emissions for CMIP6 (BB4CMIP) based on merging satellite observations with proxies and fire models (1750â2015)\n\nMargreet J.

We have merged satellite information with proxy datasets and fire models to reconstruct fire emissions since 1750 AD. Our dataset indicates that, on a global scale, fire emissions were relatively constant over time. Since roughly 1950, declining emissions from savannas were approximately balanced by increased emissions from tropical deforestation zones.\n\nBuilding Asset Value Mapping in Support of Flood Risk Assessment: A Case Study of Shanghai, China\n\nJidong Wu, Xu Wang, and Elco Koks\n\nNat.

We found that South American forest exhibited interannual variability without a clear trend during the 1990s, but increased from 2000 to 2004. After 2004, forest loss decreased again, mainly as a result of a decrease in the Brazilian Amazon, whereas at the same time regions south of the arc of deforestation showed an increase in forest loss.\n\nIncreasing flood exposure in the Netherlands: implications for risk financing\n\nB.

Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2707–2726, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2707-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2707-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIranian insurers have been offering earthquake coverage since the 1990s. However, despite international best practices, they still do not use modern methods for risk pricing and management. As such, they seem to be accumulating seismic risk over time. This paper examines the viability of this market in Iran by comparing the local market practices with international best practices in earthquake risk pricing (catastrophe modeling) and insurance risk management (European Solvency II regime).\n\nMicro-business participation in collective flood adaptation: lessons from scenario-based analysis in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\nJavier Revilla Diez, Roxana Leitold, Van Tran, and Matthias Garschagen\n\nNat.

Based on a study in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, approximately 70 % are ready for awareness campaigns, and 39 % would provide financial support if costs were shared. These findings underscore the need for increased involvement of micro-businesses in local adaptation plans to enhance collective adaptive capacity.\n\nBrief communication: Storm Daniel flood impact in Greece in 2023: mapping crop and livestock exposure from synthetic-aperture radar (SAR)\n\nKang He, Qing Yang, Xinyi Shen, Elias Dimitriou, Angeliki Mentzafou, Christina Papadaki, Maria Stoumboudi, and Emmanouil N.

A detailed analysis revealed that the crop most affected by the flooding was cotton; the inundated area of more than 282 km2 comprised ~ 30 % of the total area planted with cotton in central Greece. In terms of livestock, we estimate that more than 14 000 ornithoids and 21 500 sheep and goats were affected. Consequences for agriculture and animal husbandry in Greece are expected to be severe.\n\nRisk reduction through managed retreat?

Resettling them to safer locations becomes a major strategy, not least because of climate change. This paper dives into the success factors of government-led resettlement in Manila and finds surprising results which challenge the usual narrative and fuel the conversation on resettlement as an adaptation strategy. Contrary to expectations, the location – whether urban or rural – of the new home is less important than safety from floods.\n\nBrief communication: Lessons learned and experiences gained from building up a global survey on societal resilience to changing droughts\n\nMarina Batalini de Macedo, Marcos Roberto Benso, Karina Simone Sass, Eduardo Mario Mendiondo, Greicelene Jesus da Silva, Pedro Gustavo CÃ¢mara da Silva, Elisabeth Shrimpton, Tanaya Sarmah, Da Huo, Michael Jacobson, Abdullah Konak, Nazmiye Balta-Ozkan, and Adelaide Cassia Nardocci\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2165–2173, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2165-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2165-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith climate change, societies increasingly need to adapt to deal with more severe droughts and the impacts they can have on food production. To make better adaptation decisions, drought resilience indicators can be used. To build these indicators, surveys with experts can be done. However, designing surveys is a costly process that can influence how experts respond. In this communication, we aim to deal with the challenges encountered in the development of surveys to help further research.\n\nRegional seismic risk assessment based on ground conditions in Uzbekistan\n\nVakhitkhan Alikhanovich Ismailov, Sharofiddin Ismatullayevich Yodgorov, Akhror Sabriddinovich Khusomiddinov, Eldor Makhmadiyorovich Yadigarov, Bekzod Uktamovich Aktamov, and Shuhrat Bakhtiyorovich Avazov\n\nNat.

This is particularly relevant for areas of research involving the management of shared water resources, the impact of regional development on flood risk, and strategies to reduce economic losses from flooding.\n\nQuantitative study of storm surge risk assessment in an undeveloped coastal area of China based on deep learning and geographic information system techniques: a case study of Double Moon Bay\n\nLichen Yu, Hao Qin, Shining Huang, Wei Wei, Haoyu Jiang, and Lin Mu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2003–2024, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2003-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2003-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper proposes a quantitative storm surge risk assessment method for data-deficient regions. A coupled model is used to simulate five storm surge scenarios. Deep learning is used to extract building footprints. Economic losses are calculated by combining adjusted depth–damage functions with inundation simulation results. Zoning maps illustrate risk levels based on economic losses, aiding in disaster prevention measures to reduce losses in coastal areas.\n\nMultisectoral analysis of drought impacts and management responses to the 2008â2015 record drought in the Colorado Basin, Texas\n\nStephen B. Ferencz, Ning Sun, Sean W. D. Turner, Brian A. Smith, and Jennie S. Rice\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1871–1896, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1871-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1871-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDrought has long posed an existential threat to society. Population growth, economic development, and the potential for more extreme and prolonged droughts due to climate change pose significant water security challenges. Better understanding the impacts and adaptive responses resulting from extreme drought can aid adaptive planning. The 2008–2015 record drought in the Colorado Basin, Texas, United States, is used as a case study to assess impacts and responses to severe drought.\n\nSimulating multi-hazard event sets for life cycle consequence analysis\n\nLeandro Iannacone, Kenneth OtÃ¡rola, Roberto Gentile, and Carmine Galasso\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1721–1740, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1721-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1721-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper presents a review of the available classifications for hazard interactions in a multi-hazard context, and it incorporates such classifications from a modeling perspective. The outcome is a sequential Monte Carlo approach enabling efficient simulation of multi-hazard event sets (i.e., sequences of events throughout the life cycle). These event sets can then be integrated into frameworks for the quantification of consequences for the purposes of life cycle consequence (LCCon) analysis.\n\nAnalysis of the effects of urban micro-scale vulnerabilities on tsunami evacuation using an agent-based model â case study in the city of Iquique, Chile\n\nRodrigo Cienfuegos, Gonzalo Ãlvarez, Jorge LeÃ³n, Alejandro Urrutia, and SebastiÃ¡n Castro\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Evacuation modeling and tsunami modeling are integrated, allowing for an estimation of the potential number of people that the inundation may reach under different scenarios by emulating the dynamics and behavior of the population and their decision-making regarding the starting time of the evacuation.\n\nFactors of influence on flood risk perceptions related to Hurricane Dorian: an assessment of heuristics, time dynamics, and accuracy of risk perceptions\n\nLaurine A. de Wolf, Peter J. Robinson, W. J. Wouter Botzen, Toon Haer, Jantsje M. Mol, and Jeffrey Czajkowski\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1303–1318, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1303-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1303-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn understanding of flood risk perceptions may aid in improving flood risk communication. We conducted a survey among 871 coastal residents in Florida who were threatened to be flooded by Hurricane Dorian. Part of the original sample was resurveyed after Dorian failed to make landfall to investigate changes in risk perception. We find a strong influence of previous flood experience and social norms on flood risk perceptions. Furthermore, flood risk perceptions declined after the near-miss event.\n\nAnticipating a risky future: long short-term memory (LSTM) models for spatiotemporal extrapolation of population data in areas prone to earthquakes and tsunamis in Lima, Peru\n\nChristian GeiÃ, Jana Maier, Emily So, Elisabeth Schoepfer, Sven Harig, Juan Camilo GÃ³mez Zapata, and Yue Zhu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1051–1064, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1051-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1051-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe establish a model of future geospatial population distributions to quantify the number of people living in earthquake-prone and tsunami-prone areas of Lima and Callao, Peru, for the year 2035. Areas of high earthquake intensity will experience a population growth of almost 30 %. The population in the tsunami inundation area is estimated to grow by more than 60 %. Uncovering those relations can help urban planners and policymakers to develop effective risk mitigation strategies.\n\nA new regionally consistent exposure database for Central Asia: population and residential buildings\n\nChiara Scaini, Alberto Tamaro, Baurzhan Adilkhan, Satbek Sarzhanov, Vakhitkhan Ismailov, Ruslan Umaraliev, Mustafo Safarov, Vladimir Belikov, Japar Karayev, and Ettore Faga\n\nNat.

We provide a regional-scale database of assets at risk, including population and residential buildings, based on existing information and recent data collected for each Central Asian country. The population and number of buildings are also estimated for the year 2080 to support the definition of disaster risk reduction strategies.\n\nAlways on My Mind: Indications of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Among Those Affected by the 2021 Flood Event in the Ahr Valley, Germany\n\nMarie-Luise Zenker, Philip Bubeck, and Annegret H. Thieken\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-725,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-725, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite the visible flood damage, mental health impacts are a growing concern. Yet, there is limited data in Germany. A survey in a heavily affected region revealed 28 % showing signs of posttraumatic stress disorder one year later. Risk factors Include gender, serious injury or illness due to flooding, and feeling left alone to cope with impacts. The study highlights the need for tailored mental health support for flood-affected populations.\n\nStudy on seismic risk assessment model of water supply systems in mainland China\n\nTianyang Yu, Banghua Lu, Hui Jiang, and Zhi Liu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 803–822, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-803-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-803-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA basic database for seismic risk assessment of 720 urban water supply systems in mainland China is established. The parameters of the seismic risk curves of 720 cities are calculated. The seismic fragility curves of various facilities in the water supply system are given based on the logarithmic normal distribution model. The expected seismic loss and the expected loss rate index of 720 urban water supply systems in mainland China in the medium and long term are given.\n\nMapping current and future flood exposure using a 5 m flood model and climate change projections\n\nConnor Darlington, Jonathan Raikes, Daniel Henstra, Jason Thistlethwaite, and Emma K. Raven\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 699–714, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-699-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-699-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impacts of climate change on local floods require precise maps that clearly demarcate changes to flood exposure; however, most maps lack important considerations that reduce their utility in policy and decision-making. This article presents a new approach to identifying current and projected flood exposure using a 5 m model. The results highlight advancements in the mapping of flood exposure with implications for flood risk management.\n\nBrief communication: On the environmental impacts of the 2023 floods in Emilia-Romagna (Italy)\n\nChiara Arrighi and Alessio Domeneghetti\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 673–679, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-673-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-673-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this communication, we reflect on environmental flood impacts by analysing the reported environmental consequences of the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods. The most frequently reported damage involves water resources and water-related ecosystems. Indirect effects in time and space, intrinsic recovery capacity, cascade impacts on socio-economic systems, and the lack of established monitoring activities appear to be the most challenging aspects for future research.\n\nA regional-scale approach to assessing non-residential building, transportation and cropland exposure in Central Asia\n\nChiara Scaini, Alberto Tamaro, Baurzhan Adilkhan, Satbek Sarzhanov, Zukhritdin Ergashev, Ruslan Umaraliev, Mustafo Safarov, Vladimir Belikov, Japar Karayev, and Ettore FagÃ\n\nNat.

We show that our two-stage model conserves the performance of the original and even has the potential to introduce savings in anticipatory action resources. Such model generalizability is important in increasing the applicability of such tools around the world.\n\nA Guide of Indicators Creation for Critical Infrastructures Resilience. Based on a Multi-criteria Framework Focusing on Optimisation Actions for Road Transport System\n\nZhuyu Yang, Bruno Barroca, Ahmed Mebarki, Katia LaffrÃ©chine, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Dolidon, and Lionel Lilas\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-204,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-204, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOperationalision of “resilience” will be a major milestone contributing to hazard management for Critical infrastructures (CIs). To integrate resilience assessment into operational management, this study designs a step-by-step guide that enables users to create specific indicators to suit their particular situation. The assessment results can assist CIs managers in their decision-making as it is based on a multi-criteria framework that considers the various interests of stakeholders.\n\nIdentifying vulnerable populations in urban society: a case study in a flood-prone district of Wuhan, China\n\nJia Xu, Makoto Takahashi, and Weifu Li\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 179–197, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-179-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-179-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThrough the development of micro-individual social vulnerability indicators and cluster analysis, this study assessed the level of social vulnerability of 599 residents from 11 communities in the Hongshan District of Wuhan. The findings reveal three levels of social vulnerability: high, medium, and low. Quantitative assessments offer specific comparisons between distinct units, and the results indicate that different types of communities have significant differences in social vulnerability.\n\nAn assessment of potential improvements in social capital, risk awareness, and preparedness from digital technologies\n\nTommaso Piseddu, Mathilda Englund, and Karina Barquet\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 145–161, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-145-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-145-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContributions to social capital, risk awareness, and preparedness constitute the parameters to test applications in disaster risk management. We propose an evaluation of four of these: mobile positioning data, social media crowdsourcing, drones, and satellite imaging. The analysis grants the opportunity to investigate how different methods to evaluate surveys' results may influence final preferences. We find that the different assumptions on which these methods rely deliver diverging results.\n\nSpatial accessibility of emergency medical services under inclement weather: a case study in Beijing, China\n\nYuting Zhang, Kai Liu, Xiaoyong Ni, Ming Wang, Jianchun Zheng, Mengting Liu, and Dapeng Yu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 63–77, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-63-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-63-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article is aimed at developing a method to quantify the influence of inclement weather on the accessibility of emergency medical services (EMSs) in Beijing, China, and identifying the vulnerable areas that could not get timely EMSs under inclement weather. We found that inclement weather could reduce the accessibility of EMSs by up to 40%. Furthermore, towns with lower baseline EMSs accessibility are more vulnerable when inclement weather occurs.\n\nReview article: Current approaches and critical issues in multi-risk recovery planning of urban areas exposed to natural hazards\n\nSoheil Mohammadi, Silvia De Angeli, Giorgio Boni, Francesca Pirlone, and Serena Cattari\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 79–107, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-79-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-79-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper critically reviews disaster recovery literature from a multi-risk perspective. Identified key challenges encompass the lack of approaches integrating physical reconstruction and socio-economic recovery, the neglect of multi-risk interactions, the limited exploration of recovery from a pre-disaster planning perspective, and the low consideration of disaster recovery as a non-linear process in which communities need change over time.\n\nEstimating emergency costs for earthquakes and floods in Central Asia based on modelled losses\n\nEmilio Berny, Carlos Avelar, Mario A. Salgado-GÃ¡lvez, and Mario Ordaz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 53–62, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-53-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-53-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a methodology to estimate the total emergency costs based on modelled damages for earthquakes and floods, together with the demographic and building characteristics of the study area. The methodology has been applied in five countries in central Asia, the first time that these estimates are made available for the study area and are intended to be useful for regional and local stakeholders and decision makers.\n\nAn Impact Chain-based exploration of multi-hazard vulnerability dynamics. The multi-hazard of floods and the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania\n\nAndra-Cosmina Albulescu and Iuliana ArmaÈ\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-5,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-5, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study delves into 1) compounded impacts and 2) the dynamics of vulnerability within a multi-hazard context, proposing an Impact Chain-based framework that analyses the augmentation of vulnerability. The case study refers to the flood events and the COVID-19 pandemic that affected Romania (2020–2021). The Impact Chain shows that 1) the unforseen implications of impacts, 2) wrongful action of adaptation options, and 3) inaction can set the premises for increased vulnerability.\n\nCompound flood impacts from Hurricane Sandy on New York City in climate-driven storylines\n\nHenrique M. D. Goulart, Irene Benito Lazaro, Linda van Garderen, Karin van der Wiel, Dewi Le Bars, Elco Koks, and Bart van den Hurk\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 29–45, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-29-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-29-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe explore how Hurricane Sandy (2012) could flood New York City under different scenarios, including climate change and internal variability. We find that sea level rise can quadruple coastal flood volumes, while changes in Sandy's landfall location can double flood volumes. Our results show the need for diverse scenarios that include climate change and internal variability and for integrating climate information into a modelling framework, offering insights for high-impact event assessments.\n\nRegional-scale landslide risk assessment in Central Asia\n\nFrancesco Caleca, Chiara Scaini, William Frodella, and Veronica Tofani\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 13–27, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-13-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-13-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLandslide risk analysis is a powerful tool because it allows us to identify where physical and economic losses could occur due to a landslide event. The purpose of our work was to provide the first regional-scale analysis of landslide risk for central Asia, and it represents an advanced step in the field of risk analysis for very large areas. Our findings show, per square kilometer, a total risk of about USD 3.9 billion and a mean risk of USD 0.6 million.\n\nCost estimation for the monitoring instrumentation of landslide early warning systems\n\nMarta Sapena, Moritz Gamperl, Marlene KÃ¼hnl, Carolina Garcia-LondoÃ±o, John Singer, and Hannes TaubenbÃ¶ck\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3913–3930, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3913-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3913-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new approach for the deployment of landslide early warning systems (LEWSs) is proposed. We combine data-driven landslide susceptibility mapping and population maps to identify exposed locations. We estimate the cost of monitoring sensors and demonstrate that LEWSs could be installed with a budget ranging from EUR 5 to EUR 41 per person in Medellín, Colombia. We provide recommendations for stakeholders and outline the challenges and opportunities for successful LEWS implementation.\n\nThe role of response efficacy and self-efficacy in disaster preparedness actions for vulnerable households\n\nDong Qiu, Binglin Lv, Yuepeng Cui, and Zexiong Zhan\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3789–3803, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3789-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3789-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper divides preparedness behavior into minimal and adequate preparedness. In addition to studying the main factors that promote families' disaster preparedness, we also study the moderating effects of response efficacy and self-efficacy on preparedness actions by vulnerable families. Based on the findings of this study, policymakers can target interventions and programs that can be designed to remedy the current lack of disaster preparedness education for vulnerable families.\n\nScientists as storytellers: the explanatory power of stories told about environmental crises\n\nJenni Barclay, Richie Robertson, and M. Teresa Armijos\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3603–3615, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3603-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3603-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStories create avenues for sharing the meanings and social implications of scientific knowledge. We explore their value when told between scientists during a volcanic eruption. They are important vehicles for understanding how risk is generated during volcanic eruptions and create new knowledge about these interactions. Stories explore how risk is negotiated when scientific information is ambiguous or uncertain, identify cause and effect, and rationalize the emotional intensity of a crisis.\n\nDynamic Response of Pile-Slab Retaining Wall Structure under Rockfall Impact\n\nPeng Zou, Gang Luo, Yuzhang Bi, and Hanhua Xu\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2715,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2715, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis manuscript addresses to numerically analyze the dynamic responses and damage mechanism of the pile-slab retaining wall under the rockfall impacts by employing the refined finite element model. The results provide insights into structure dynamic response analysis of the PSRW and serve as a benchmark for further research.\n\nBack analysis of a building collapse under snow and rain loads in a Mediterranean area\n\nIsabelle Ousset, Guillaume Evin, Damien Raynaud, and Thierry Faug\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3509–3523, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3509-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3509-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper deals with an exceptional snow and rain event in a Mediterranean region of France which is usually not prone to heavy snowfall and its consequences on a particular building that collapsed completely. Independent analyses of the meteorological episode are carried out, and the response of the building to different snow and rain loads is confronted to identify the maincritical factors that led to the collapse.\n\nAssessment of building damage and risk under extreme flood scenarios in Shanghai\n\nJiachang Tu, Jiahong Wen, Liang Emlyn Yang, Andrea Reimuth, Stephen S. Young, Min Zhang, Luyang Wang, and Matthias Garschagen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

The results provide a benchmark and also a clear future for buildings with respect to flood risks in Shanghai. This study links directly to disaster risk management, e.g., the Shanghai Master Plan. We also discussed different potential adaptation options for flood risk management.\n\nMangrove ecosystem properties regulate high water levels in a river delta\n\nIgnace Pelckmans, Jean-Philippe Belliard, Luis E. Dominguez-Granda, Cornelis Slobbe, Stijn Temmerman, and Olivier Gourgue\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3169–3183, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3169-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3169-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMangroves are increasingly recognized as a coastal protection against extreme sea levels. Their effectiveness in doing so, however, is still poorly understood, as mangroves are typically located in tropical countries where data on mangrove vegetation and topography properties are often scarce. Through a modelling study, we identified the degree of channelization and the mangrove forest floor topography as the key properties for regulating high water levels in a tropical delta.\n\nAnalysis of flood warning and evacuation efficiency by comparing damage and life-loss estimates with real consequences related to the SÃ£o Francisco tailings dam failure in Brazil\n\nAndrÃ© Felipe Rocha Silva and Julian Cardoso EleutÃ©rio\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3095–3110, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3095-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3095-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work evaluates the application of flood consequence models through their application in a real case related to a tailings dam failure. Furthermore, we simulated the implementation of less efficient alert systems on life-loss alleviation. The results revealed that the models represented the event well and were able to estimate the relevance of implementing efficient alert systems. They highlight that their use may be an important tool for new regulations for dam safety legislation.\n\nCriteria-based visualization design for hazard maps\n\nMax Schneider, Fabrice Cotton, and Pia-Johanna Schweizer\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2505–2521, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2505-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2505-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHazard maps are fundamental to earthquake risk reduction, but research is missing on how to design them. We review the visualization literature to identify evidence-based criteria for color and classification schemes for hazard maps. We implement these for the German seismic hazard map, focusing on communicating four properties of seismic hazard. Our evaluation finds that the redesigned map successfully communicates seismic hazard in Germany, improving on the baseline map for two key properties.\n\nLow-regret climate change adaptation in coastal megacities â evaluating large-scale flood protection and small-scale rainwater detention measures for Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\nLeon Scheiber, Christoph Gabriel David, Mazen Hoballah Jalloul, Jan Visscher, Hong Quan Nguyen, Roxana Leitold, Javier Revilla Diez, and Torsten Schlurmann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2333–2347, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2333-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2333-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLike many other megacities in low-elevation coastal zones, Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam suffers from the convoluting impact of changing environmental stressors and rapid urbanization. This study assesses quantitative hydro-numerical results against the background of the low-regret paradigm for (1) a large-scale flood protection scheme as currently constructed and (2) the widespread implementation of small-scale rainwater detention as envisioned in the Chinese Sponge City Program.\n\nModeling compound flood risk and risk reduction using a globally applicable framework: a pilot in the Sofala province of Mozambique\n\nDirk Eilander, AnaÃ¯s Couasnon, Frederiek C. Sperna Weiland, Willem Ligtvoet, Arno Bouwman, Hessel C. Winsemius, and Philip J. Ward\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2251–2272, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2251-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2251-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents a framework for assessing compound flood risk using hydrodynamic, impact, and statistical modeling. A pilot in Mozambique shows the importance of accounting for compound events in risk assessments. We also show how the framework can be used to assess the effectiveness of different risk reduction measures. As the framework is based on global datasets and is largely automated, it can easily be applied in other areas for first-order assessments of compound flood risk.\n\nScenario-based multi-risk assessment from existing single-hazard vulnerability models. An application to consecutive earthquakes and tsunamis in Lima, Peru\n\nJuan Camilo GÃ³mez Zapata, Massimiliano Pittore, Nils Brinckmann, Juan Lizarazo-Marriaga, Sergio Medina, Nicola Tarque, and Fabrice Cotton\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2203–2228, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2203-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2203-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo investigate cumulative damage on extended building portfolios, we propose an alternative and modular method to probabilistically integrate sets of single-hazard vulnerability models that are being constantly developed by experts from various research fields to be used within a multi-risk context. We demonstrate its application by assessing the economic losses expected for the residential building stock of Lima, Peru, a megacity commonly exposed to consecutive earthquake and tsunami scenarios.\n\nUsing machine learning algorithms to identify predictors of social vulnerability in the event of a hazard: Istanbul case study\n\nOya KalaycÄ±oÄlu, Serhat Emre AkhanlÄ±, Emin Yahya MenteÅe, Mehmet KalaycÄ±oÄlu, and Sibel KalaycÄ±oÄlu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2133–2156, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2133-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2133-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe associations between household characteristics and hazard-related social vulnerability in Istanbul, Türkiye, were assessed using machine learning techniques. The results indicated that less educated households with no social security and job insecurity that live in squatter houses are at a higher risk of social vulnerability. We present the findings in an open-access R Shiny web application, which can serve as a guidance for identifying the target groups in the interest of risk mitigation.\n\nLarge-scale risk assessment on snow avalanche hazard in alpine regions\n\nGregor Ortner, Michael BrÃ¼ndl, Chahan M. Kropf, Thomas RÃ¶Ã¶sli, Yves BÃ¼hler, and David N. Bresch\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2089–2110, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2089-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2089-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a new approach to assess avalanche risk on a large scale in mountainous regions. It combines a large-scale avalanche modeling method with a state-of-the-art probabilistic risk tool. Over 40 000 individual avalanches were simulated, and a building dataset with over 13 000 single buildings was investigated. With this new method, risk hotspots can be identified and surveyed. This enables current and future risk analysis to assist decision makers in risk reduction and adaptation.\n\nProbabilistic and machine learning methods for uncertainty quantification in power outage prediction due to extreme events\n\nPrateek Arora and Luis Ceferino\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1665–1683, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1665-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1665-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPower outage models can help utilities manage risks for outages from hurricanes. Our article reviews the existing outage models during hurricanes and highlights their strengths and limitations. Existing models can give erroneous estimates with outage predictions larger than the number of customers, can struggle with predictions for catastrophic hurricanes, and do not adequately represent infrastructure failure's uncertainties. We suggest models for the future that can overcome these challenges.\n\nPublic intention to participate in sustainable geohazard mitigation: an empirical study based on an extended theory of planned behavior\n\nHuige Xing, Ting Que, Yuxin Wu, Shiyu Hu, Haibo Li, Hongyang Li, Martin Skitmore, and Nima Talebian\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1529–1547, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1529-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1529-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDisaster risk reduction requires public power. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors influencing the public's intention to participate in disaster risk reduction. An empirical study was conducted using structural equation modeling data analysis methods. The findings show that public attitudes, perceptions of those around them, ability to participate, and sense of participation are important factors.\n\nAn assessment of shortâmedium-term interventions using CAESAR-Lisflood in a post-earthquake mountainous area\n\nDi Wang, Ming Wang, Kai Liu, and Jun Xie\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1409–1423, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1409-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1409-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe short–medium-term intervention effect on the post-earthquake area was analysed by simulations in different scenarios. The sediment transport patterns varied in different sub-regions, and the relative effectiveness in different scenarios changed over time with a general downward trend, where the steady stage implicated the scenario with more facilities performing better in controlling sediment output. Therefore, the simulation methods could support optimal rehabilitation strategies.\n\nReview article: Design and evaluation of weather index insurance for multi-hazard resilience and food insecurity\n\nMarcos Roberto Benso, Gabriela Chiquito Gesualdo, Roberto Fray Silva, Greicelene Jesus Silva, Luis Miguel Castillo RÃ¡palo, Fabricio Alonso Richmond Navarro, Patricia AngÃ©lica Alves Marques, JosÃ© AntÃ´nio Marengo, and Eduardo Mario Mendiondo\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1335–1354, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1335-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1335-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article is about how farmers can better protect themselves from disasters like droughts, extreme temperatures, and floods. The authors suggest that one way to do this is by offering insurance contracts that cover these different types of disasters. By having this insurance, farmers can receive financial support and recover more quickly. The article elicits different ideas about how to design this type of insurance and suggests ways to make it better.\n\nDesign and application of a multi-hazard risk rapid assessment questionnaire for hill communities in the Indian Himalayan region\n\nShivani Chouhan and Mahua Mukherjee\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1267–1286, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1267-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1267-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Himalayas are prone to multi-hazards. To minimise loss, proper planning and execution are necessary. Data collection is the basis of any risk assessment process. This enhanced survey form is easy to understand and pictorial and identifies high-risk components of any building (structural and non-structural) surrounded by multi-hazards. Its results can help to utilise the budget in a prioritised way. A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities) analysis has been performed.\n\nIdentifying the drivers of private flood precautionary measures in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\nThulasi Vishwanath Harish, Nivedita Sairam, Liang Emlyn Yang, Matthias Garschagen, and Heidi Kreibich\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1125–1138, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1125-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1125-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal Asian cities are becoming more vulnerable to flooding. In this study we analyse the data collected from flood-prone houses in Ho Chi Minh City to identify what motivates the households to adopt flood precautionary measures. The results revealed that educating the households about the available flood precautionary measures and communicating the flood protection measures taken by the government encourage the households to adopt measures without having to experience multiple flood events.\n\nPerformance of the flood warning system in Germany in July 2021 â insights from affected residents\n\nAnnegret H. Thieken, Philip Bubeck, Anna Heidenreich, Jennifer von Keyserlingk, Lisa Dillenardt, and Antje Otto\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 973–990, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-973-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-973-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn July 2021 intense rainfall caused devastating floods in western Europe with 184 fatalities in the German federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia (NW) and Rhineland-Palatinate (RP), calling their warning system into question. An online survey revealed that 35 % of respondents from NW and 29 % from RP did not receive any warning. Many of those who were warned did not expect severe flooding, nor did they know how to react. The study provides entry points for improving Germany's warning system.\n\nCited articles\n\n24Rhein: A1, A61, A553 nach Flut: EngpÃ¤sse zwischen HÃ¼rth und Dreieck Erfttal, https://www.24rhein.de/leben-im-westen/verkehr/freigabe-a1-a61-a553-sperrung-kreuz-kerpen-frei-bauarbeiten-planung-90985671.html, last access: 16Â JuneÂ 2022.â\n\nADAC: Flutkatastrophe 2021: FahrzeugschÃ¤den in HÃ¶he von 450 Millionen Euro, https://www.adac.de/news/flutkatastrophe-fahrzeugschaeden/ (last access: 16Â JuneÂ 2022), 2021.â\n\nAssuralia: De verzekeringssector in cijfers: trends en overstromingen in juli '21, https://press.assuralia.be/de-verzekeringssector-in-cijfers-trends-en-overstromingen-juli-21, last access: 9Â JuneÂ 2022.â\n\nÃrzte Zeitung: Ãber 100 Praxen in Nordrhein durch Flut lahmgelegt, https://www.aerztezeitung.de/Nachrichten/Ueber-100-Praxen-in-Nordrhein-durch-Flut-lahmgelegt-421456.html, last access: 13Â DecemberÂ 2021.â\n\nBad MÃ¼nstereifel: Aktuelles: Newsblog zur Hochwasserkatastrophe in Bad MÃ¼nstereifel, https://www.bad-muenstereifel.de/rathaus-service/hochwasserkatastrophe/, last access: 13 December 2021.â\n\nBento, A.
