        "text": "Drug-eluting coronary stents â focus on improved patient outcomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJaffery, Zehra; Prasad, Amit; Lee, John H; White, Christopher J\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe development of stent has been a major advance in the treatment of obstructive coronary artery disease since the introduction of balloon angioplasty. Subsequently, neointimal hyperplasia within the stent leading to in-stent restenosis emerged as a major obstacle in long-term success of percutaneous coronary intervention. Recent introduction of drug-eluting stents is a major breakthrough to tackle this problem. This review article summarizes stent technology, reviews progress of drug-eluting stents and discusses quality of life, patient satisfaction, and acceptability of percutaneous coronary intervention.

First generation drug-eluting stents (DES), (sirolimus drug-eluting stents and paclitaxel drug-eluting stents), reduce the risk of restenosis and target vessel revascularization compared to bare metal stents. However, stent thrombosis emerged as a major safety concern with first generation DES. In response to these safety issues, second generation DES were developed with different drugs, improved stent platforms and more biocompatible durable or bioabsorbable polymeric coating. This article presents an overview of safety and efficacy of the first and second generation DES in STEMI.

However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of drug-eluting stents, and increasing concern about their safety, in routine clinical practice. From the Cardiac Care Network of Ontario's population-based clinical registry of all patients undergoing PCI in Ontario, Canada, we identified a well-balanced cohort of 3751 pairs of patients, matched on the basis of propensity score, who received either bare-metal stents alone or drug-eluting stents alone during an index PCI procedure between December 1, 2003, and March 31, 2005. The primary outcomes of the study were the rates of target-vessel revascularization, myocardial infarction, and death. The 2-year rate of target-vessel revascularization was significantly lower among patients who received drug-eluting stents than among those who received bare-metal stents (7.4% vs. 10.7%, P<0.001). Drug-eluting stents were associated with significant reductions in the rate of target-vessel revascularization among patients with two or three risk factors for restenosis (i.e., presence of diabetes, small vessels [<3 mm in diameter], and long lesions [> or =20 mm]) but not among lower-risk patients. The 3-year mortality rate was significantly higher in the bare-metal-stent group than in the drug-eluting-stent group (7.8% vs. 5.5%, P<0.001), whereas the 2-year rate of myocardial infarction was similar in the two groups (5.2% and 5.7%, respectively; P=0.95). Drug-eluting stents are effective in reducing the need for target-vessel revascularization in patients at highest risk for restenosis, without a significantly increased rate of death or myocardial infarction.

Design Mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis of 258â544 patient years of follow-up from randomized trials. Data sources and study selection PubMed, Embase, and Central were searched for randomized trials comparing any of the Food and Drug Administration approved durable polymer drug eluting stents (sirolimus eluting, paclitaxel eluting, cobalt chromium everolimus eluting, platinum chromium everolimus eluting, zotarolimus eluting-Endeavor, and zotarolimus eluting-Resolute) or biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents, with each other or against bare metal stents. Outcomes Long term efficacy (target vessel revascularization, target lesion revascularization) and safety (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis). Landmark analysis at more than one year was evaluated to assess the potential late benefit of biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents. Results From 126 randomized trials and 258â544 patient years of follow-up, for long term efficacy (target vessel revascularization), biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to paclitaxel eluting stents (rate ratio 0.66, 95% credibility interval 0.57 to 0.78) and zotarolimus eluting stent-Endeavor (0.69, 0.56 to 0.84) but not to newer generation durable polymer drug eluting stents (for example: 1.03, 0.89 to 1.21 versus cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents). Similarly, biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to paclitaxel eluting stents (rate ratio 0.61, 0.37 to 0.89) but inferior to cobalt chromium everolimus eluting stents (2.04, 1.27 to 3.35) for long term safety (definite stent thrombosis). In the landmark analysis after one year, biodegradable polymer drug eluting stents were superior to sirolimus eluting stents for definite stent thrombosis (rate ratio 0.29, 0.10 to 0.82) but were associated with increased\n\nHybrid coronary revascularization in the era of drug-eluting stents.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurphy, Gavin J; Bryan, Alan J; Angelini, Gianni D\n\n2004-11-01\n\nLeft internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery bypass grafting integrated with percutaneous coronary angioplasty (hybrid procedure) offers multivessel revascularization with minimal morbidity in high-risk patients. This is caused in part by the avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass-related morbidity and manipulation of the aorta coupled with minimally invasive techniques. Hybrid revascularization is currently reserved for particularly high-risk patients or those with favorable anatomic variants however, largely because of the emergence of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, which permits more complete multivessel revascularization, with low morbidity in high-risk groups. The wider introduction of hybrid revascularization is limited chiefly by the high number of repeat interventions compared with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, which occurs because of the target vessel failure rate of percutaneous coronary intervention. Other demerits are the costs and logistic problems associated with performing two procedures with differing periprocedural management protocols. Recently, drug-eluting stents have reduced the need for repeat intervention after percutaneous coronary intervention, and this has raised the possibility that the results of hybrid revascularization may now equal or even better those of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Although undoubtedly effective at reducing in-stent restenosis, drug-eluting stents will not address the issues of incomplete revascularization or the logistic problems associated with hybrid. Uncertainty regarding the long-term effectiveness of drug-eluting stents in many patients, as well as their high cost when compared with those of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, also militates against the wider introduction of hybrid revascularization.\n\nPaclitaxel Drug-Eluting Stents in Peripheral Arterial Disease: A Health Technology Assessment\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Peripheral arterial disease is a condition in which atherosclerotic plaques partially or completely block blood flow to the legs. Although percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and metallic stenting have high immediate success rates in treating peripheral arterial disease, long-term patency and restenosis rates in long and complex lesions remain unsatisfactory. Objective The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness and budget impact of Zilver paclitaxel self-expanding drug-eluting stents for the treatment of de novo or restenotic lesions in above-the-knee peripheral arterial disease. Data Sources Literature searches were performed using Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid Embase, EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and EBM Reviews. For the economic review, a search filter was applied to limit search results to economics-related literature. Data sources for the budget impact analysis included expert opinion, published literature, and Ontario administrative data. Review Methods Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies were included in the clinical effectiveness review, and full economic evaluations were included in the economic literature review. Studies were included if they examined the effect of Zilver paclitaxel drug-eluting stents in de novo or restenotic lesions in above-the-knee arteries. For the budget impact analysis, 3 scenarios were constructed based on different assumptions. Results One randomized controlled trial reported a significantly higher patency rate with Zilver paclitaxel drug-eluting stents for lesions â¤ 14 cm than with angioplasty or bare metal stents. One observational study showed no difference in patency rates between Zilver paclitaxel drug-eluting stents and paclitaxel drug-coated balloons.

Current treatment methods include atherectomy, coronary angioplasty (as a percutaneous coronary intervention), and coronary artery bypass. Among them, the insertion of stents into the coronary artery is one of the commonly used methods for CAD, although the formation of in-stent restenosis (ISR) is a major drawback, demanding improvement in stent technology. Stents can be improved using the delivery of DNA, siRNA, and miRNA rather than anti-inflammatory/anti-thrombotic drugs. In particular, genes that could interfere with the development of plaque around infected regions are conjugated on the stent surface to inhibit neointimal formation. Despite their potential benefits, it is necessary to explore the various properties of gene-eluting stents. Furthermore, multifunctional electronic stents that can be used as a biosensor and deliver drug- or gene-based on physiological condition will be a very promising way to the successful treatment of ISR. In this review, we have discussed the molecular mechanism of restenosis, the use of drug- and gene-eluting stents, and the possible roles that these stents have in the prevention and treatment of coronary restenosis. Further, we have explained how multifunctional electronic stents could be used as a biosensor and deliver drugs based on physiological conditions.

We sought to evaluate predictors and long-term clinical outcomes of ASM. ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) was a prospective multicenter study of 8663 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention using drug-eluting stents. In a prespecified intravascular ultrasound-guided substudy, 2072 patients with 2446 culprit lesions had post-percutaneous coronary intervention intravascular ultrasound and were classified according to the presence or absence of ASM. After intravascular ultrasound-guided percutaneous coronary intervention, the overall prevalence of ASM after successful drug-eluting stents implantation was 14.4% per patient and 12.6% per lesion. Compared to lesions without ASM, lesions with ASM had larger in-stent lumen areas, larger stent areas, and larger in-stent vessel areas. A larger mean plaque area along with more attenuated plaque was observed in lesions with ASM versus lesions without ASM. Lesions with ASM had greater proximal and distal reference lumen areas and more distal, but not proximal, reference calcium compared to lesions without ASM. At 2-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in the incidence of cardiac death; myocardial infarction; early, late, or very late stent thrombosis; or clinically driven target lesion revascularization in patients with ASM versus those without ASM. Furthermore, ASM was not an independent predictor of 2-year major adverse cardiac events or target lesion revascularization even when forced into the multivariate model. In patients treated with intravascular ultrasound-guided drug-eluting stents implantation, ASM was not associated with adverse clinical events during long-term follow-up including, but not limited to, stent thrombosis.

PCI has come of age over the last four decades with enormous forays in the technology and drugs which have greatly enhanced its capability. Angioplasty and bare metal stents were plagued by high failure rates on account of restenosis leading to repeat revascularization procedures. Insights into pathophysiology of instent restenosis (ISR) and neointimal hyperplasia triggered the development of DES. The dreamlike remarkable reduction in ISR with DES was enthusiastically welcomed. Soon thereafter emerged the spectre of very late stent thrombosis (VLST) with DES. VLST was a new entity seen predominantly with DES and pathological insights as to the cause was instrumental in the development and efficacy of new generation DES. This review will highlight the evolution and present day DES for coronary interventions.\n\nRecent Advances in Drug Eluting Stents\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPuranik, Amey S.; Dawson, Eileen R.; Peppas, Nicholas A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOne of the most common medical interventions to reopen an occluded vessel is the implantation of a coronary stent. While this method of treatment is effective initially, restenosis, or the re-narrowing of the artery frequently occurs largely due to neointimal hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells. Drug eluting stents were developed in order to provide local, site-specific, controlled release of drugs that can inhibit neointima formation. By implementing a controlled release delivery system it may be possible to control the time release of the pharmacological factors and thus be able to bypass some of the critical events associated with stent hyperplasia and prevent the need for subsequent intervention. However, since the advent of first-generation drug eluting stents, long-term adverse effects have raised concerns regarding their safety. These limitations in safety and efficacy have triggered considerable research in developing biodegradable stents and more potent drug delivery systems. In this review, we shed light on the current state-of-the-art in drug eluting stents, problems related to them and highlight some of the ongoing research in this area.

To improve outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization, there have been advances in the design of drug-eluting stents (DES), including the development of drug-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS). Prospective, randomized, controlled trials comparing bare-metal stents (BMS), paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES), sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stents (E-ZES), cobalt-chromium (CoCr) everolimus-eluting stents (EES), platinum-chromium (PtCr)-EES, biodegradable polymer (BP)-EES, Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (R-ZES), BP biolimus-eluting stents (BP-BES), hybrid sirolimus-eluting stents (H [Orsiro]-SES), polymer-free sirolimus- and probucol-eluting stents, or BVS were searched in online databases. The primary endpoint was definite or probable stent thrombosis at 1 year. A total of 147 trials including 126,526 patients were analyzed in this study. All contemporary DES were superior to BMS and PES in terms of definite or probable stent thrombosis at 1 year. CoCr-EES, PtCr-EES, and H-SES were associated with significantly lower risk than BVS. CoCr-EES and H-SES were superior to SES and BP-BES. The risk of myocardial infarction was significantly lower with H-SES than with BVS. There were no significant differences regarding all-cause or cardiac mortality. Contemporary devices including BVS showed comparably low risks of repeat revascularization. Contemporary DES, including biocompatible DP-DES, BP-DES, and polymer-free DES, showed a low risk of definite or probable stent thrombosis at 1 year. BVS had an increased risk of device thrombosis compared with CoCr-EES, PtCr-EES, and H-SES. Data from extended follow-up are warranted to confirm the long-term safety of contemporary coronary devices. Copyright Â© 2016 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Among other factors, stent coating technologies can influence blood compatibility, affect acute and sub-acute healing, and potentially trigger a chronic inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term (7 and 28 days) and long-term (90 and 180 days) coating integrity of the Xience Prime Everolimus-Eluting Stent (EES), Resolute Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent (ZES), Taxus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent (PES), and Nobori Biolimus A9-Eluting Stent (BES) in a rabbit ilio-femoral stent model. Stented arteries (nâ=â48) were harvested and the tissue surrounding the implanted stents digested away with an enzymatic solution. Results demonstrated that the majority of struts of EES were without any coating defects with a few struts showing minor defects. Similarly, for the ZES, most of the struts were without coating defects at all time points except at 180 days. The majority of PES demonstrated mostly webbing and uneven coating. In the BES group, the majority of strut coating showed polymer cracking. Overall, the EES and ZES had fewer coating defects than the PES and BES. Coating defects, however increase over time for the ZES, whereas the percent of coating irregularities remained constant for the EES. These results provide, for the first time, a comparison of the long-term durability of these drug-eluting stent coatings in vivo.

Over the last 30 years, the development of coronary artery angioplasty and stenting has drastically reduced mortality during acute coronary syndromes while also reducing symptoms of chronic coronary artery disease. Unfortunately, the placement of stents in a coronary artery can be complicated by in-stent thrombosis or restenosis. In 2003â2004, a new generation of stents was introduced to the market with the goal of reducing the rate of restenosis. These stents, called drug eluting stents (DES), are coated with a pharmacological agent designed to reduce the neointimal hyperplasia associated with restenosis. Within a year, approximately 80% of all percutaneous coronary interventions performed within the US involved placement of a DES. In 2006, a controversy arose about the possibility of a statistically significant increased risk of acute stent thrombosis associated with DES especially when used for an âoff labelâ indication. This risk was attributed to delayed endothelization. This controversy has led to a reduction in the use of DES along with longer use of dual platelet inhibition with aspirin and clopidogrel. Recently Medtronic introduced a new DES to the market called the EndeavorÂ® stent â a zotarolimus eluting stent.

Whether these advancements improve clinical safety and efficacy has not been shown in previous randomised trials. We aimed to examine the clinical outcomes of a bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent compared with a durable polymer everolimus-eluting stent in a broad patient population undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. BIOFLOW V was an international, randomised trial done in patients undergoing elective and urgent percutaneous coronary intervention in 90 hospitals in 13 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the USA). Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older with ischaemic heart disease undergoing planned stent implantation in de-novo, native coronary lesions. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either an ultrathin strut (60 Î¼m) bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent or to a durable polymer everolimus-eluting stent. Randomisation was via a central web-based data capture system (mixed blocks of 3 and 6), and stratified by study site. The primary endpoint was 12-month target lesion failure. The primary non-inferiority comparison combined these data from two additional randomised trials of bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent and durable polymer everolimus-eluting stent with Bayesian methods. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02389946. Between May 8, 2015, and March 31, 2016, 4772 patients were recruited into the study. 1334 patients met inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to treatment with bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stents (n=884) or durable polymer everolimus-eluting stents (n=450). 52 (6%) of 883 patients in the bioresorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent group and 41 (10%) of\n\nDrug-eluting versus bare-metal coronary stents: where are we now?\n\nPubMed\n\nAmoroso, Nicholas S; Bangalore, Sripal\n\n2012-11-01\n\nDrug-eluting stents have dramatically reduced the risk of restenosis, but concerns of an increased risk of stent thrombosis have provided uncertainty about their use. Recent studies have continued to show improved procedural and clinical outcomes with drug-eluting stents both in the setting of acute coronary syndromes and stable coronary artery disease. Newer generation drug-eluting stents (especially everolimus-eluting stents) have been shown to be not only efficacious but also safe with reduced risk of stent thrombosis when compared with bare-metal stents, potentially changing the benchmark for stent safety from bare-metal stents to everolimus-eluting stents. While much progress is being made in the development of bioabsorbable polymer stents, nonpolymer stents and bioabsorbable stent technology, it remains to be seen whether these stents will have superior safety and efficacy outcomes compared with the already much improved rates of revascularization and stent thrombosis seen with newer generation stents (everolimus-eluting stents and resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents).\n\nBiodegradable-polymer drug-eluting stents vs. bare metal stents vs. durable-polymer drug-eluting stents: a systematic review and Bayesian approach network meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKang, Si-Hyuck; Park, Kyung Woo; Kang, Do-Yoon; Lim, Woo-Hyun; Park, Kyung Taek; Han, Jung-Kyu; Kang, Hyun-Jae; Koo, Bon-Kwon; Oh, Byung-Hee; Park, Young-Bae; Kandzari, David E; Cohen, David J; Hwang, Seung-Sik; Kim, Hyo-Soo\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of biodegradable-polymer (BP) drug-eluting stents (DES), bare metal stents (BMS), and durable-polymer DES in patients undergoing coronary revascularization, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis using a Bayesian framework. Study stents included BMS, paclitaxel-eluting (PES), sirolimus-eluting (SES), endeavor zotarolimus-eluting (ZES-E), cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting (CoCr-EES), platinium-chromium everolimus-eluting (PtCr-EES), resolute zotarolimus-eluting (ZES-R), and BP biolimus-eluting stents (BP-BES). After a systematic electronic search, 113 trials with 90 584 patients were selected. The principal endpoint was definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST) defined according to the Academic Research Consortium within 1 year. Biodegradable polymer-biolimus-eluting stents [OR, 0.56; 95% credible interval (CrI), 0.33-0.90], SES (OR, 0.53; 95% CrI, 0.38-0.73), CoCr-EES (OR, 0.34; 95% CrI, 0.23-0.52), and PtCr-EES (OR, 0.31; 95% CrI, 0.10-0.90) were all superior to BMS in terms of definite or probable ST within 1 year. Cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents demonstrated the lowest risk of ST of all stents at all times after stent implantation. Biodegradable polymer-biolimus-eluting stents was associated with a higher risk of definite or probable ST than CoCr-EES (OR, 1.72; 95% CrI, 1.04-2.98). All DES reduced the need for repeat revascularization, and all but PES reduced the risk of myocardial infarction compared with BMS. All DESs but PES and ZES-E were superior to BMS in terms of ST within 1 year. Cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents was safer than any DES even including BP-BES. Our results suggest that not only the biodegradability of polymer, but the optimal combination of stent alloy, design, strut thickness, polymer, and drug all combined determine the safety of DES.\n\nPrevalence, Features, and Prognostic Importance of Edge Dissection After Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation: An ADAPT-DES Intravascular Ultrasound Substudy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobayashi, Nobuaki; Mintz, Gary S; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Metzger, D Christopher; Rinaldi, Michael J; Duffy, Peter L; Weisz, Giora; Stuckey, Thomas D; Brodie, Bruce R; Parvataneni, Rupa; Kirtane, Ajay J; Stone, Gregg W; Maehara, Akiko\n\n2016-07-01\n\nIntravascular ultrasound detects stent edge dissections after percutaneous coronary intervention that are not seen angiographically. This study investigated the association between stent edge dissections and clinical outcomes. ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) was a large-scale, prospective, multicenter study of patients undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation. In this prospective substudy, 2062 patients (2433 lesions) were evaluated with intravascular ultrasound to characterize the morphological features and clinical outcomes of stent edge dissection after percutaneous coronary intervention. The prevalence of post-percutaneous coronary intervention stent edge dissection was 6.6% per lesion (161 of 2433). Calcified plaque at the proximal stent edge (relative risk [RR]=1.72; P=0.04) and proximal stent edge expansion (RR=1.18; P=0.004) were predictors for proximal dissection; attenuated plaque at the distal stent edge (RR=3.52; P=0.004), distal reference plaque burden (RR=1.56; P<0.0001), and distal edge stent expansion (RR=1.11; P=0.02) were predictors for distal dissection. At 1-year follow-up, target lesion revascularization was more common in lesions with versus without dissection (5.2% versus 2.7%; P=0.04). Multivariable analysis indicated that residual dissection was associated with target lesion revascularization at 1-year follow-up (RR=2.67; P=0.02). Among lesions with dissection, smaller effective lumen area increased the risk of target lesion revascularization at 1-year follow-up (cutoff value of 5.1 mm(2); P=0.05). Greater stent expansion and the presence of large, calcified, and/or attenuated plaques were independent predictors of stent edge dissection.

Outcomes of patients receiving a TAXUS LibertÃ© or XIENCE V drug-eluting stent were compared. Baseline clinical, procedural, and follow-up data at 12 months were collected from 10 clinical centers by an electronic data capture system. The study's primary end point was major adverse cardiac events: a composite of all-cause death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, and stent thrombosis. The trial is registered with http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01134159). Data were entered for 1,195 patients (PES, n = 595; EES, n = 600). Baseline clinical characteristics were similar except for higher dyslipidemia, systemic hypertension, and family history of coronary artery disease in the EES group. In-hospital outcome was similar between groups, with an overall in-hospital stent thrombosis rate of 0.2%. The primary end point at 12 months was similar (EES 7.8% vs 10.8%, p = 0.082). Overall stent thrombosis rate was lower in the EES group (0.3% vs 1.2%, respectively, p = 0.107); however, target lesion revascularization was similar (PES, hazard ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 2.19, p = 0.064). There was no difference in overall mortality between groups. In conclusion, second-generation EESs and PESs demonstrated similar efficacy and safety profiles for broadened patient and lesion subsets compared to a selected population from the pivotal trials. However, for composite efficacy and safety end points, EESs outperformed second-generation PESs. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed in the French National Health Insurance setting. Effectiveness settings were taken from a meta-analysis of 117â 762 patient-years with 76 randomised trials. The main effectiveness criterion was major cardiac event-free survival. Effectiveness and costs were modelled over a 5-year horizon using a three-state Markov model. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were calculated for a range of thresholds for willingness to pay per year without major cardiac event gain. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Base case results demonstrated that DES are dominant over BMS, with an increase in event-free survival and a cost-reduction of â¬184, primarily due to a diminution of second revascularisations, and an absence of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. These results are robust for uncertainty on one-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of â¬7000 per major cardiac event-free year gained, DES has a >95% probability of being cost-effective versus BMS. Following DES price decrease, new-generation DES development and taking into account recent meta-analyses results, the DES can now be considered cost-effective regardless of selective indication in France, according to European recommendations.\n\nDrug eluting biliary stents to decrease stent failure rates: A review of the literature\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShatzel, Joseph; Kim, Jisoo; Sampath, Kartik; Syed, Sharjeel; Saad, Jennifer; Hussain, Zilla H; Mody, Kabir; Pipas, J Marc; Gordon, Stuart; Gardner, Timothy; Rothstein, Richard I\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBiliary stenting is clinically effective in relieving both malignant and non-malignant obstructions. However, there are high failure rates associated with tumor ingrowth and epithelial overgrowth as well as internally from biofilm development and subsequent clogging. Within the last decade, the use of prophylactic drug eluting stents as a means to reduce stent failure has been investigated. In this review we provide an overview of the current research on drug eluting biliary stents. While there is limited human trial data regarding the clinical benefit of drug eluting biliary stents in preventing stent obstruction, recent research suggests promise regarding their safety and potential efficacy.

V.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWe present a simple model of experimental setup for in vitro study of drug release from drug eluting stents and drug propagation in artificial tissue samples representing blood vessels. The model is further reduced using the assumption on vastly different characteristic diffusion times in the stent coating and in the artificial tissue. The model is used to derive a relationship between the times at which the measurements have to be taken for two experimental platforms, with corresponding artificial tissue samples made of different materials with different drug diffusion coefficients, to properly compare the drug release characteristics of drug eluting stents.\n\nDrug-eluting stents to prevent stent thrombosis and restenosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nIm, Eui; Hong, Myeong-Ki\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAlthough first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) have significantly reduced the risk of in-stent restenosis, they have also increased the long-term risk of stent thrombosis. This safety concern directly triggered the development of new generation DES, with innovations in stent platforms, polymers, and anti-proliferative drugs. Stent platform materials have evolved from stainless steel to cobalt or platinum-chromium alloys with an improved strut design. Drug-carrying polymers have become biocompatible or biodegradable and even polymer-free DES were introduced. New limus-family drugs (such as everolimus, zotarolimus or biolimus) were adopted to enhance stent performances. As a result, these new DES demonstrated superior vascular healing responses on intracoronary imaging studies and lower stent thrombotic events in actual patients. Recently, fully-bioresorbable stents (scaffolds) have been introduced, and expanding their applications. In this article, the important concepts and clinical results of new generation DES and bioresorbable scaffolds are described.\n\nControversies in the use & implementation of drug-eluting stent technology\n\nPubMed Central\n\nItagaki, Brandon K.; Brar, Somjot S.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe introduction of drug eluting stents has resulted in dramatic reductions in the rates of restenosis and the need for repeat revascularization. In the last several years, concern has been raised regarding the long-term safety of this technology, particularly in the area of late restenosis and stent thrombosis. The development of newer anti-restenotic drug coatings, biodegradable polymers and even completely bioabsorbable stents offer the potential to address these limitations. Additional questions that have recently come to the forefront include the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, the use of platelet reactivity assays and genetic testing and drug eluting stent use in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. This article will attempt to address these and other areas of controversy in the use and implementation of drug eluting stents.

Drug-eluting stents reduce restenosis rates compared with bare metal stents; however, controversy remains regarding which drug-eluting stents provides greater benefit in patients with diabetes. Accordingly, we compared the safety and efficacy of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) with paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) among diabetic patients in a contemporary registry. Using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry, we evaluated 2-year outcomes of diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions with SES (n=677) and PES (n=328). Clinical and demographic characteristics, including age, body mass index, insulin use, left ventricular function, and aspirin/clopidogrel use postprocedure, did not differ significantly between the groups except that PES-treated patients had a greater frequency of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. At the 2-year follow-up, no significant differences were observed between PES and SES with regard to safety or efficacy end points. PES- and SES-treated patients had similar rates of death (10.7% versus 8.2%, P=0.20), death and myocardial infarction (14.9% versus 13.6%, P=0.55), repeat revascularization (14.8% versus 17.8%, P=0.36), and stent thrombosis (1.3% versus 1.3%, P=0.95). After adjustment, no significant differences between the 2 stent types in any outcome were observed. PES and SES are equally efficacious and have similar safety profiles in diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions in clinical practice.\n\nDrug eluting stents and modern stent technologies for in-stent restenosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWerner, Martin\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe implantation of metallic stents has become a standard procedure to improve the outcome after angioplasty of peripheral vessels. However, the occurrence of in-stent restenosis is hampering the long-term efficacy of these procedures and is associated with re-occurrence of symptoms. The optimal treatment modality for in-stent-restenosis in the peripheral vasculature is not well examined.

The degree to which they experience cardiac events at a higher rate than non-high-risk patients is unclear. To assess the rates of major adverse cardiac events during the index admission and 1 year after the implantation of drug-eluting stents in patients with high-risk angiographic and clinical features. From July 2004 to September 2005, consecutive patients who underwent attempted stent placement at 42 different hospitals throughout the United States were enrolled in a prospective multicenter registry. We analyzed outcomes of 3323 patients who received at least 1 drug-eluting stent for a reason other than acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The study population was divided into 2 groups based on presence of at least 1 of 9 off-label characteristics based on the current US Food and Drug Administration-approved indications for sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stents. The composite clinical outcomes of death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization during the index admission and death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization at 1 year were evaluated. Of the 3323 patients, 1817 (54.7%) had at least 1 off-label characteristic. During the index hospitalization, the composite clinical outcome occurred in 198 (10.9%) of patients in the off-label group and 76 (5.0%) of patients in the on-label group (adjusted odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75-3.07; P<.001). At 1 year, the composite clinical outcome occurred more often in the off-label group compared with the on-label group; 309 (17.5%) vs 131 (8.9%) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.16; 95% CI, 1.74-2.67; P<.001).

In view of the overall low frequency of stent thrombosis, large sample sizes are needed to accurately estimate treatment differences between stents. We compared the risk of thrombosis between bare-metal and drug-eluting stents. For this network meta-analysis, randomised controlled trials comparing different drug-eluting stents or drug-eluting with bare-metal stents currently approved in the USA were identified through Medline, Embase, Cochrane databases, and proceedings of international meetings. Information about study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample characteristics, and clinical outcomes was extracted. 49 trials including 50,844 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups were analysed. 1-year definite stent thrombosis was significantly lower with cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stents (CoCr-EES) than with bare-metal stents (odds ratio [OR] 0Â·23, 95% CI 0Â·13-0Â·41). The significant difference in stent thrombosis between CoCr-EES and bare-metal stents was evident as early as 30 days (OR 0Â·21, 95% CI 0Â·11-0Â·42) and was also significant between 31 days and 1 year (OR 0Â·27, 95% CI 0Â·08-0Â·74). CoCr-EES were also associated with significantly lower rates of 1-year definite stent thrombosis compared with paclitaxel-eluting stents (OR 0Â·28, 95% CI 0Â·16-0Â·48), permanent polymer-based sirolimus-eluting stents (OR 0Â·41, 95% CI 0Â·24-0Â·70), phosphorylcholine-based zotarolimus-eluting stents (OR 0Â·21, 95% CI 0Â·10-0Â·44), and Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (OR 0Â·14, 95% CI 0Â·03-0Â·47). At 2-year follow-up, CoCr-EES were still associated with significantly lower rates of definite stent thrombosis than were bare-metal (OR 0Â·35, 95% CI 0Â·17-0Â·69) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (OR 0Â·34, 95% CI 0Â·19-0Â·62).

Treatment of patients with DES-ISR remains a challenge. The RIBS IV (Restenosis Intra-Stent of Drug-Eluting Stents: Drug-Eluting Balloons vs Everolimus-Eluting Stents) trial is a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing DEB and EES in patients with DES-ISR. The pre-specified comparison of the 3-year clinical outcomes obtained with these interventions is the main objective of the present study. A total of 309 patients with DES-ISR were randomized to DEB (nÂ = 154) or EES (nÂ = 155). At angiographic follow-up, the in-segment minimal lumen diameter was larger in the EES arm (2.03 Â± 0.7 mm vs. 1.80 Â± 0.6 mm; pÂ <Â 0.01). Three-year clinical follow-up was obtained in all enrolled patients (100%). The combined clinical outcome measure of cardiac death, myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization was significantly reduced in the EES arm (19 [12.3%] vs. 31 [20.1%]; pÂ = 0.04; hazard ratio: 0.57 [95% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.96]), driven by a lower need for target lesion revascularization (11 [7.1%] vs. 24 [15.6%]; pÂ = 0.015; hazard ratio: 0.43 [95% confidence interval: 0.21 to 0.87]). The need for \"late\" (>1 year) target lesion revascularization (2.6% vs. 4%) and target vessel revascularization (4% vs. 6.6%) was similar in the 2 arms. Rates of cardiac death (3.9% vs. 3.2%), myocardial infarction (2.6% vs. 4.5%), and stent thrombosis (1.3% vs. 2.6%) at 3 years were also similar in both arms. The 3-year clinical follow-up of this randomized clinical trial demonstrates that in patients with DES-ISR, EES reduce the need for repeat interventions compared with DEB.

The present review was undertaken in order to highlight the various coronary stents that have been investigated in our Heart Research Center, and how far we have come from the first heparin-coated stent first used in the late 1990s. Thereafter, from the abciximab-coated stent to the current gene-delivery stent and other newer agents, our group has applied a range of techniques in this field. However, in groups similar to ours, the restenosis rates of such stents are still high for second-generation drug-eluting stents (DESs). Moreover, our nation imports almost all of these types of stents from other countries. Thus, we need to develop domestic coronary stents. Research into newer DESs are warranted in Korea so as to achieve improved safety and efficacy outcomes.

Indomethacin, dexamethasone, and simvastatin were used in the materials. The effects of the biodegradable stent material on cytokines and other inflammatory mediators were measured using the Human Cytokine Antibody Array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in THP-1 cells, with bacterial lipopolysaccharide as a positive control. To assess the biocompatibility of the stent materials, we used muscle implantation. Biodegradable stent materials without drug-eluting properties and silicone and latex were used as controls. The measurements were done at 3 weeks and 3 months. The PLA stent material induced production of inflammatory mediators, especially interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta, in vitro. The increase in the production of these mediators with the PLA stent material was smaller than in the cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. In vivo, the effects of the biodegradable materials did not differ at 3 weeks, although, at 3 months, dexamethasone had induced more tissue reactions than had the other materials. At 3 months, fibrosis and chronic inflammatory changes were decreased in the biodegradable material groups compared with the positive control. PLA stent material increased the production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators less than did positive controls in vitro. The in vivo biocompatibility of the drug-eluting biodegradable materials was better than that of the positive controls. Drug-eluting biodegradable urethral stents could potentially offer a new treatment modality in the future. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Recent 1- and 3-year results from randomized trials have indicated similar safety and efficacy outcomes of BP-BES and DP-EES. Whether benefits of the biodegradable polymer device arise over longer follow-up is unknown. Moreover, in-depth, prospective, long-term follow-up data on metallic drug-eluting stents with durable or biodegradable polymers are scarce. The COMPARE II trial (Abluminal Biodegradable Polymer Biolimus-Eluting Stent Versus Durable Polymer Everolimus-Eluting Stent) was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, all-comers trial in which 2,707 patients were randomly allocated (2:1) to BP-BES or DP-EES. The pre-specified endpoint at 5 years was major adverse cardiac events, a composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization. Five-year follow-up was available in 2,657 patients (98%). At 5 years, major adverse cardiac events occurred in 310 patients (17.3%) in the BP-BES group and 142 patients (15.6%) in the DP-EES group (pÂ = 0.26). The rate of theÂ combined safety endpoint all-cause death or myocardial infarction was 15.0% in the BP-BES group versus 14.8% inÂ the DP-EES group (pÂ = 0.90), whereas the efficacy measure target vessel revascularization was 10.6% versus 9.0% (pÂ = 0.18), respectively. Interestingly, definite stent thrombosis rates did not differ between groups (1.5% for BP-BES vs. 0.9% for DP-EES; pÂ = 0.17). The 5-year analysis comparing biodegradable polymer-coated BES and the durable polymer-coated EES confirms the initial early- and mid-term results regarding similar safety and efficacy outcomes in this all-comers percutaneous coronary intervention population.

Gene-eluting stents hold promise of overcoming some biological and technical problems inherent to drug-eluting stent technology. As the field of gene-eluting stents matures it becomes evident that all three main design modules of a gene-eluting stent: a therapeutic transgene, a vector and a delivery system are equally important for accomplishing sustained inhibition of neointimal formation in arteries treated with gene delivery stents.

The long-term clinical outcomes between second generation DES and BMS for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using network meta-analysis were compared. Randomized controlled trials comparing stent types (first generation DES, second generation DES, or BMS) were considered for inclusion. A search strategy used Medline, Embase, Cochrane databases, and proceedings of international meetings. Information about study design, inclusion criteria, and sample characteristics were extracted. Network meta-analysis was used to pool direct (comparison of second generation DES to BMS) and indirect evidence (first generation DES with BMS and second generation DES) from the randomized trials. Twelve trials comparing all stents types including 9,673 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups were analyzed. Second generation DES was associated with significantly lower incidence of definite or probable ST (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.89), MI (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39-0.89), and TVR at 3 years (OR 0.50: 95% CI 0.31-0.81) compared with BMS. In addition, there was a significantly lower incidence of MACE with second generation DES versus BMS (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.74) at 3 years. These were driven by a higher rate of TVR, MI and stent thrombosis in the BMS group at 3 years. There was a non-significant reduction in the overall and cardiac mortality [OR 0.83, 95% CI (0.60-1.14), OR 0.88, 95% CI (0.6-1.28)] with the use of second generation DES versus BMS at 3 years.

The use of stents has reduced the rate of restenosis by preventing elastic recoil and negative remodeling. However, in-stent restenosis remains one of the major drawbacks of this procedure. Drug-eluting stents (DESs) have proven to be effective in reducing the risk of late restenosis, but the use of currently marketed DESs presents safety concerns, including the non-specificity of therapeutics, incomplete endothelialization leading to late thrombosis, the need for long-term anti-platelet agents, and local hypersensitivity to polymer delivery matrices. In addition, the current DESs lack the capacity for adjustment of the drug dose and release kinetics appropriate to the disease status of the treated vessel. The development of efficacious therapeutic strategies to prevent and inhibit restenosis after PCI is critical for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The administration of drugs using biodegradable polymer nanoparticles as carriers has generated immense interest due to their excellent biocompatibility and ability to facilitate prolonged drug release. Despite the potential benefits of nanoparticles as smart drug delivery and diagnostic systems, much research is still required to evaluate potential toxicity issues related to the chemical properties of nanoparticle materials, as well as to their size and shape. This review describes the molecular mechanism of coronary restenosis, the use of DESs, and progress in nanoparticle drug- or gene-eluting stents for the prevention and treatment of coronary restenosis.

However, there has been considerable evolution in the field of percutaneous coronary intervention, and especially, percutaneous coronary intervention for LMCA disease has been rapidly expanded with adoption of drug-eluting stents. Some, but not all randomized trials, have shown that percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents might be a suitable alternative for selected patients with LMCA disease instead of bypass surgery. However, none of previous trials involving early-generation drug-eluting stents was sufficiently powered and comparative trials using contemporary drug-eluting stents were limited. Recently, primary results of 2 new trials of EXCEL (Evaluation of XIENCE Everolimus Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization) and NOBLE (Nordic-Baltic-British Left Main Revascularization Study) were reported. However, these trials showed conflicting results, which might pose uncertainty on the optimal revascularization strategy for LMCA disease. In this article, with the incorporation of a key review on evolution of LMCA treatment, we summarize the similarity or disparity of the EXCEL and NOBLE trials, focus on how they relate to previous trials in the field, and finally speculate on how the treatment strategy may be changed or recommended for LMCA treatment.

We aim to describe the in vivo experimental result of a new polymer-free DES eluting sirolimus from stent-plus-balloon (Focus np stent, Envision Scientific) compared with a bare-metal stent (BMS) (Amazonia CroCo, Minvasys) and with a biolimus A9 eluting stent (Biomatrix, Biosensors). In 10 juvenile pigs, 23 coronary stents were implanted in the coronary arteries (8 Amazonia CroCo, 8 Focus np, and 7 Biomatrix). At 28-day follow-up, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histology were used to evaluate neointimal hyperplasia and healing response. According to OCT analysis, Focus np stents had a greater lumen area and less neointimal hyperplasia response than BMS and Biomatrix had. Histomorphometry results showed less neointimal hyperplasia in Focus np than in BMS. Histology showed a higher fibrin deposition in Biomatrix stent compared to Focus np and BMS. The new polymer-free DES with sirolimus eluted from stent-plus-balloon demonstrated safety and reduced neointimal proliferation compared with the BMS and Biomatrix stents at 28-day follow-up in this porcine coronary model. This new polymer-free DES is promising and warrants further clinical studies.\n\nCurrent State of Bioabsorbable Polymer-Coated Drug-Eluting Stents\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAkinapelli, Abhilash; Chen, Jack P.; Roy, Kristine; Donnelly, Joseph; Dawkins, Keith; Huibregtse, Barbara; Hou, Dongming\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDrug-eluting stents (DES) have been shown to significantly reduce clinical and angiograph-ic restenosis compared to bare metal stents (BMS). The polymer coatings on DES elute antiproliferative drugs to inhibit intimal proliferation and prevent restenosis after stent implantation. Permanent poly-mers which do not degrade in vivo may increase the likelihood of stent-related delayed arterial healing or polymer hypersensitivity. In turn, these limitations may contribute to an increased risk of late clinical events. Intuitively, a polymer which degrades after completion of drug release, leaving an inert metal scaffold in place, may improve arterial healing by removing a chronic source of inflammation, neoath-erosclerosis, and/or late thrombosis. In this way, a biodegradable polymer may reduce late ischemic events. Additionally, improved healing after stent implantation could reduce the requirement for long-term dual antiplatelet therapy and the associated risk of bleeding and cost. This review will focus on bioabsorbable polymer-coated DES currently being evaluated in clinical trials.\n\nDifferentiated analysis of an everolimus-eluting stent and a paclitaxel-eluting stent among higher risk subgroups for restenosis: results from the SPIRIT II trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhattab, Ahmed A; Richardt, Gert; Verin, Vitali; Kelbaek, Henning; Macaya, Carlos; Berland, Jacques; Miquel-Hebert, Karine; Dorange, CÃ©cile; Serruys, Patrick W\n\n2008-03-01\n\nRestenosis is higher among certain subpopulations when subjected to percutaneous coronary interventions even when using drug-eluting stents. The randomised SPIRIT II trial demonstrated the superiority of the XIENCE V Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System over the TAXUS Paclitaxel-Eluting Stent System in terms of in-stent late loss at six months among 300 patients treated for de novo native coronary artery lesions. In this post-hoc analysis of SPIRIT II we focused on six-month angiographic outcomes of diabetic patients (n=69), left anterior descending arteries (n=149), long lesions >20 mm (n=43), small vessels <3.0 mm (n=209) and type B2 and C lesions (n=233). In-stent late loss was consistently less among all subgroups when treated by everolimus-eluting stents compared to paclitaxel-eluting stents: diabetics 0.15+/-0.26 mm versus 0.39+/-0.34 mm, p=0.006; LAD 0.12+/-0.23 mm versus 0.44+/-0.37 mm, p<0.001; long lesions 0.13+/-0.26 mm versus 0.43+/-0.46 mm, p=0.070; small vessels 0.17+/-0.28 mm versus 0.37+/-0.39 mm, p<0.001; B2/C lesions 0.12+/-0.31 mm versus 0.36+/-0.36 mm, p<0.001. The everolimus-eluting stent remained superior in terms of in-stent late loss in a variety of higher risk populations for restenosis compared to the paclitaxel-eluting stent. These analyses were consistent with the in-stent late loss results of the overall SPIRIT II trial population.\n\nCost effectiveness of drug-eluting stents as compared with bare metal stents in patients with coronary artery disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nWislÃ¸ff, TorbjÃ¸rn; Atar, Dan; SÃ¸nbÃ¸ Kristiansen, Ivar\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of replacing bare metal stents (BMS) by drug-eluting stents (DES) when using trial data and registry data. We developed a Markov model (model of cost effectiveness of coronary artery disease) in which 60-year-old patients started by undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute or subacute coronary artery disease. The patients are followed until death or 100 years of age. Data on the occurrence of events (revascularization, acute myocardial infarction, and death) were based on Scandinavian registry data. Separate analyses were conducted with data on effectiveness based on randomized controlled trials and patient registries. On using trial data, it was found that sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) yield 0.003 greater life expectancy and $3300 lower costs than do BMS (dominant strategy). Paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) yield 0.148 more life years than do SES at additional lifetime costs of $2800 ($21,400 per life year gained). On using registry data, the cost per life year gained was found to be $4900 when replacing BMS with DES. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, on the other hand, indicate that PES only has a 50%-75% probability of being cost effective, regardless of the type of effectiveness data. DESs are cost effective with current willingness to pay for life year gains. Whether PES or SES is the most effective DES remains uncertain.\n\nA new polymer-free drug-eluting stent with nanocarriers eluting sirolimus from stent-plus-balloon compared with bare-metal stent and with biolimus A9 eluting stent in porcine coronary arteries\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGalon, Micheli Z.; Gutierrez, Paulo S.; Sojitra, Prakash; Vyas, Ashwin; Doshi, Manish; Lemos, Pedro A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Permanent polymers in first generation drug-eluting stent (DES) have been imputed to be a possible cause of persistent inflammation, remodeling, malapposition and late stent thrombosis.

The authors determined the cost-effectiveness of infrapopliteal drug-eluting stents for critical limb ischemia (CLI) treatment. The event-free individual survival outcomes defined by the absence of any major events, including death, major amputation, and target limb repeat procedures, were reconstructed on the basis of two published infrapopliteal series. The first included spot Bail-out use of Sirolimus-eluting stents versus bare metal stents after suboptimal balloon angioplasty (Bail-out SES).The second was full-lesion Primary Everolimus-eluting stenting versus plain balloon angioplasty and bail-out bare metal stenting as necessary (primary EES). The number-needed-to-treat (NNT) tomoreÂ Â» avoid one major event and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for a 3-year postprocedural period for both strategies. Overall event-free survival was significantly improved in both strategies (hazard ratio (HR) [confidence interval (CI)]: 0.68 [0.41-1.12] in Bail-out SES and HR [CI]: 0.53 [0.29-0.99] in Primary EES). Event-free survival gain per patient was 0.89 (range, 0.11-3.0) years in Bail-out SES with an NNT of 4.6 (CI: 2.5-25.6) and a corresponding ICER of 6,518 Euro-Sign (range 1,685-10,112 Euro-Sign ). Survival gain was 0.91 (range 0.25-3.0) years in Primary EES with an NNT of 2.7 (CI: 1.7-5.8) and an ICER of 11,581 Euro-Sign (range, 4,945-21,428 Euro-Sign ) per event-free life-year gained. Two-way sensitivity analysis showed that stented lesion length >10 cm and/or DES list price >1000 Euro-Sign were associated with the least economically favorable scenario in both strategies. Both strategies of bail-out SES and primary EES placement in the infrapopliteal arteries for CLI treatment exhibit single-digit NNT and relatively low corresponding ICERs.Â«Â less\n\nThe efficacy and safety of drug-eluting balloons for the treatment of in-stent restenosis as compared with drug-eluting stents and with conventional balloon angioplasty\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOh, Pyung Chun; Suh, Soon Yong; Kang, Woong Chol; Lee, Kyounghoon; Han, Seung Hwan; Ahn, Taehoon; Shin, Eak Kyun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground/Aims: Treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) is still associated with a high incidence of recurrence. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting balloons (DEB) for the treatment of ISR as compared with conventional balloon angioplasty (BA) and drug-eluting stents (DES). Methods: Between January 2006 and May 2012 a total of 177 patients (188 lesions, 64.1 Â± 11.7 years old) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for ISR were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients treated with DEB (n = 58, 32.8%), conventional BA (n = 65, 36.7%), or DES (n = 54, 30.5%). The primary end point was a major adverse cardiac event (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization(TLR). Results: Baseline characteristics were not different except for a history of previous MI, which was more frequent in patients treated by conventional BA or DES than in patients treated by DEB (40.0% vs. 48.1% vs. 17.2%, respectively, p = 0.002). The total incidences of MACEs were 10.7%, 7.4%, and 15.4% in patients treated by DEB, DES, or conventional BA, respectively (p > 0.05). TLR was more frequent in patients treated by conventional BA than in patients treated by DEB or DES, but this was not statistically significant (10.8% vs. 6.9% vs. 3.7%, p > 0.05 between all group pairs, respectively). Conclusions: This study showed that percutaneous coronary intervention using DEB might be a feasible alternative to conventional BA or DES implantation for treatment of coronary ISR. Further large-scaled, randomized study assessing long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes will be needed.

Granulation proliferation is one of the main complications. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel drug-eluting tracheal stent in reducing granulation tissue formation in a canine model, as well as the pharmacokinetic features and safety profiles of the coated drug. Methods: Eight beagles were randomly divided into a control group (bare-metal stent group, n = 4) and an experimental group (paclitaxel-eluting stent group, n = 4). The observation period was 5 months. One beagle in both groups was sacrificed at the end of the 1st and 3rd months, respectively. The last two beagles in both groups were sacrificed at the end of 5th month. The proliferation of granulation tissue and changes in tracheal mucosa were compared between the two groups. Blood routine and liver and kidney function were monitored to evaluate the safety of the paclitaxel-eluting stent. The elution method and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to characterize the rate of in vivo release of paclitaxel from the stent. Results: Compared with the control group, the proliferation of granulation tissue in the experimental group was significantly reduced. The drug release of paclitaxel-eluting stent was the fastest in the 1st month after implantation (up to 70.9%). Then, the release slowed down gradually. By the 5th month, the release reached up to 98.5%. During the observation period, a high concentration of the drug in the trachea (in the stented and adjacent unstented areas) and lung tissue was not noted, and the blood test showed no side effect. Conclusions: The paclitaxel-eluting stent could safely reduce the granulation tissue formation after stent implantation in vivo, suggesting that the paclitaxel-eluting tracheal stent might be considered for potential use in humans in the future.

Yet, information on the safety of BP-DES in routine clinical practice is limited. Our aim was to compare the safety of the recently approved BP-DES with current durable polymer drug-eluting stents (DP-DES) by analyzing adverse events, namely, stent thrombosis (ST), reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. The MAUDE database requires nationwide mandatory notification for adverse events on devices approved for clinical use. This database was searched for adverse events reported between 1 October 2015 and 25 December 2016, encountered after the placement of either BP-DES or DP-DES. Only those adverse events were included where the exposure period to the stents was comparable after the index procedure. Of all the adverse events reported, the event of interest was ST. A total of 951 adverse events were reported. ST occurred in 48/951 of all events, 31/309 and 17/642 when BP-DES or DP-DES were used, respectively (P=0.00001). Of the 31 ST events with BP-DES, 68% (21/31) occurred within less than or equal to 24âh of the index procedure and 52% (16/31) occurred within less than or equal to 2âh. Our results raise the possibility of an increased risk of ST, particularly early ST (within 24âh), with the recently approved BP-DES. However, because of the inherent limitations of reporting within the MAUDE database, these data merely highlight a potential need for additional surveillance and randomized trials to assess further the safety of the bioabsorbable platform.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of biodegradable platforms in drug eluting stents.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodriguez-Granillo, Agustina; Rubilar, Bibiana; Rodriguez-Granillo, Gaston; Rodriguez, Alfredo E\n\n2011-03-26\n\nCoronary angioplasty with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is currently the most common stent procedure worldwide. Since the introduction of DES, coronary restenosis as well as the incidence of target vessel and target lesion revascularization have been significantly reduced. However, the incidence of very late stent thrombosis beyond the first year after stent deployment has more commonly been linked to DES than to bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation. Several factors have been associated with very late stent thrombosis after DES implantation, such as delayed healing, inflammation, stent mal-apposition and endothelial dysfunction. Some of these adverse events were associated with the presence of durable polymers, which were essential to allow the elution of the immunosuppressive drug in the first DES designs. The introduction of erodable polymers in DES technology has provided the potential to complete the degradation of the polymer simultaneously or immediately after the release of the immunosuppressive drug, after which a BMS remains in place. Several DES designs with biodegradable (BIO) polymers have been introduced in preclinical and clinical studies, including randomized trials. In this review, we analyze the clinical results from 6 observational and randomized studies with BIO polymers and discuss advantages and disadvantages of this new technology.\n\nCost effectiveness of drug eluting coronary artery stenting in a UK setting: cost-utility study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBagust, A; Grayson, A D; Palmer, N D; Perry, R A; Walley, T\n\n2006-01-01\n\nTo assess the cost effectiveness of drug eluting stents (DES) compared with conventional stents for treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease in the UK. Cost-utility analysis of audit based patient subgroups by means of a simple economic model. Tertiary care. 12 month audit data for 2884 patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting at the Cardiothoracic Centre Liverpool between January 2000 and December 2002. Risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months of index procedure and reduction in risk from use of DES. Economic modelling was used to estimate the cost-utility ratio and threshold price premium. Four factors were identified for patients undergoing elective surgery (n = 1951) and two for non-elective surgery (n = 933) to predict risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months. Most patients fell within the subgroup with lowest risk (57% of the elective surgery group with 5.6% risk and 91% of the non-elective surgery group with 9.9% risk). Modelled cost-utility ratios were acceptable for only one group of high risk patients undergoing non-elective surgery (only one patient in audit data). Restricting the number of DES for each patient improved results marginally: 4% of stents could then be drug eluting on economic grounds. The threshold price premium justifying 90% substitution of conventional stents was estimated to be 112 pound sterling (212 USD, 162 pound sterling) (sirolimus stents) or 89 pound sterling (167 USD, 130 pound sterling) (paclitaxel stents). At current UK prices, DES are not cost effective compared with conventional stents except for a small minority of patients. Although the technology is clearly effective, general substitution is not justified unless the price premium falls substantially.\n\nRisk of stent thrombosis among bare-metal stents, first-generation drug-eluting stents, and second-generation drug-elutingÂ stents: results from a registry of 18,334 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nTada, Tomohisa; Byrne, Robert A; Simunovic, Iva; King, Lamin A; Cassese, Salvatore; Joner, Michael; Fusaro, Massimiliano; Schneider, Simon; Schulz, Stefanie; Ibrahim, Tareq; Ott, Ilka; Massberg, Steffen; Laugwitz, Karl-Ludwig; Kastrati, Adnan\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThis study sought to compare the risk of stent thrombosis among patients treated with bare-metal stents (BMS), first-generation drug-eluting stents (G1-DES), and second-generation drug-eluting stents (G2-DES) for a period of 3 years. In patients undergoing coronary stenting, there is a scarcity of long-term follow-up data on cohorts large enough to compare rates of stent thrombosis across the stent generations. A total of 18,334 patients undergoing successful coronary stent implantation from 1998 to 2011 at 2 centers in Munich, Germany, were included in this study. Patients were stratified into 3Â groups according to treatment with BMS, G1-DES, and G2-DES. The cumulative incidence of definite stent thrombosis at 3 years was 1.5% with BMS, 2.2% with G1-DES, and 1.0% with G2-DES. On multivariate analysis, G1-DES compared with BMS showed a significantly higher risk of stent thrombosis (odds ratio [OR]: 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47Â to 2.86; p < 0.001). G2-DES were associated with a similar risk of stent thrombosis compared with BMS (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.56 to 1.19; pÂ = 0.30). Beyond 1 year, the risk of stent thrombosis was significantly increased with G1-DES compared with BMS (OR: 4.72; 95% CI: 2.01 to 11.1; p < 0.001), but not with G2-DES compared with BMS (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.32 to 3.25; pÂ = 0.98). In a large cohort of unselected patients undergoing coronary stenting, compared with BMS, there was a significant excess risk of stent thrombosis at 3 years with G1-DES, driven by an increased risk of stent thrombosis events beyond 1 year. G2-DES were associated with a similar risk of stent thrombosis compared with BMS. Copyright Â© 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In addition, it has been speculated that the mechanical performance of DES, compared to BMS, may be related to the type of polymer used to cover stents. We aimed at evaluating the deliverability of DES with a lactate based biodegradable polymer and BMS in patients with stable coronary artery disease in a prospective randomised study. One hundred eleven consecutive patients (age: 36-77, mean 58.8 years) scheduled for routine angioplasty due to stable coronary disease were randomised to receive BMS (Chopin II(TM), Balton, Poland) or paclitaxel eluting stent (Chopin Luc(TM), Balton, Poland) using the same metal platform. Only patients scheduled for angioplasty using the direct implantation technique of a single stent were randomised. The exclusion criteria included patients ã 80 years, multivessel disease and reference diameter of the target vessel ã 3.5 mm. In the BMS group (n = 55; 35 males and 20 females), the mean diameter of implanted stents was 3.09 Â± 0.40 and the mean length was 11.37 Â± 2.80, whereas in the DES group (n = 56; 34 males and 22 females) the mean stent sizes were 3.02 Â± 0.34 and 17.90 Â± 7.38 mm, respectively (p ã 0.05 for length). The groups did not significantly differ regarding the frequency of stent implantation to particular coronary vessels. The direct stenting technique was attempted and failed, leading to the stents' implantation after predilatation in five patients in the BMS group and six patients in the DES group. Failure of stent implantation and subsequent implantation of another stent type was observed in no BMS patients and in one DES patient (NS). Although stent covering with lactate based drug eluting polymer may increase its stiffness, it does not affect\n\nRed blood cell distribution width and long-term outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in the drug-eluting stenting era: a two-year cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nYao, Hai-Mu; Sun, Tong-Wen; Zhang, Xiao-Juan; Shen, De-Liang; Du, You-You; Wan, You-Dong; Zhang, Jin-Ying; Li, Ling; Zhao, Luo-Sha\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPrevious studies suggest the higher the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) the greater the risk of mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the relationship between RDW and long-term outcome in CAD patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a drug-eluting stent (DES) remains unclear. This study was designed to evaluate the long-term effect of RDW in patients treated with drug-eluting stent for CAD. In total of 2169 non-anemic patients (1468 men, mean age 60.2 Â± 10.9 years) with CAD who had undergone successful PCI and had at least one drug-eluting stent were included in this study. Patients were grouped according to their baseline RDW: Quartile 1 (RDW<12.27%), Quartile 2 (12.27% â¤ RDW <13%), Quartile 3 (13% â¤ RDW<13.5%), and Quartile 4 (RDW â¥ 13.5). The incidence of in-hospital mortality and death or myocardial infarction was significantly higher in Quartiles 3 and 4 compared with Quartile 1 (P<0.05). After a follow-up of 29 months, the incidence of all-cause death and stent thrombosis in Quartile 4 was higher than in Quartiles 1, 2, and 3 (P<0.05). The incidence of death/myocardial infarction/stroke and cardiac death in Quartile 4 was higher than in Quartiles 1 and 2 (P<0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that RDW was an independent predictor of all-cause death (hazard ratio (HR)â=â1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI)â=â1.15-1.62, P<0.001) and outcomes of death/myocardial infarction/stroke (HRâ=â1.21, 95% CIâ=â1.04-1.39, Pâ=â0.013). The cumulative survival rate of Quartile 4 was lower than that of Quartiles 1, 2, and 3 (P<0.05). High RDW is an independent predictor of long-term adverse clinical outcomes in non-anemic patients with CAD treated with DES.\n\nFunctional Nanoarchitectures For Enhanced Drug Eluting Stents\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaleh, Yomna E.; Gepreel, Mohamed A.; Allam, Nageh K.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDifferent strategies have been investigated to allow for optimum duration and conditions for endothelium healing through the enhancement of coronary stents. In this study, a nanoarchitectured system is proposed as a surface modification for drug eluting stents. Highly oriented nanotubes were vertically grown on the surface of a new Ni-free biocompatible Ti-based alloy, as a potential material for self-expandable stents. The fabricated nanotubes were self-grown from the potential stent substrate, which are also proposed to enhance endothelial proliferation while acting as drug reservoir to hinder Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMC) proliferation. Two morphologies were synthesized to investigate the effect of structure homogeneity on the intended application. The material was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Nanoindentation technique was used to study the mechanical properties of the fabricated material. Cytotoxicity and proliferation studies were performed and compared for the two fabricated nanoarchitectures, versus smooth untextured samples, using in-vitro cultured endothelial cells. Finally, the drug loading capacity was experimentally studied and further supported by computational modeling of the release profile.\n\nEverolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds versus everolimus-eluting metallic stents: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nCassese, Salvatore; Byrne, Robert A; Ndrepepa, Gjin; Kufner, Sebastian; Wiebe, Jens; Repp, Janika; Schunkert, Heribert; Fusaro, Massimiliano; Kimura, Takeshi; Kastrati, Adnan\n\n2016-02-06\n\nBioresorbable coronary stents might improve outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary interventions. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, its performance versus everolimus-eluting metallic stents remains poorly defined. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds versus everolimus-eluting metallic stents in patients with ischaemic heart disease treated with percutaneous revascularisation. We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant websites for randomised trials investigating everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds versus everolimus-eluting metallic stents published or posted between Nov 30, 2006, and Oct 12, 2015. The primary efficacy outcome was target lesion revascularisation and the primary safety outcome was definite or probable stent (scaffold) thrombosis. Secondary outcomes were target lesion failure (the composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation), myocardial infarction, death, and in-device late lumen loss. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and weighted mean differences with 95% CIs, and calculated the risk estimates for the main outcomes according to a random-effects model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015026374. We included six trials, comprising data for 3738 patients randomised to receive percutaneous coronary intervention with either an everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (n=2337) or an everolimus-eluting metallic stent (n=1401). Median follow-up was 12 months (IQR 9-12). Patients treated with bioresorbable vascular scaffolds had a similar risk of target lesion revascularisation (OR 0.97 [95% CI 0.66-1.43]; p=0.87), target lesion failure (1.20 [0.90-1.60]; p=0.21), myocardial infarction (1.36 [0.98-1.89]; p\n\nComparison of the Efficacy of Everolimus-Eluting Stents Versus Drug-Eluting Balloons in Patients With In-Stent Restenosis (from the RIBS IV and V Randomized Clinical Trials).\n\nPubMed\n\nAlfonso, Fernando; PÃ©rez-Vizcayno, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; GarcÃ­a Del Blanco, Bruno; GarcÃ­a-Touchard, Arturo; Masotti, MÃ³nica; LÃ³pez-Minguez, JosÃ© R; IÃ±iguez, AndrÃ©s; Zueco, Javier; Velazquez, Maite; Cequier, Angel; LÃ¡zaro-GarcÃ­a, Rosa; MartÃ­, Vicens; Moris, CÃ©sar; Urbano-Carrillo, Cristobal; Bastante, Teresa; Rivero, Fernando; CÃ¡rdenas, Alberto; Gonzalo, Nieves; JimÃ©nez-Quevedo, Pilar; FernÃ¡ndez, Cristina\n\n2016-02-15\n\nTreatment of patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a challenge. This study sought to compare the efficacy of everolimus-eluting stents (EESs) and drug-eluting balloons (DEBs) with paclitaxel in patients with ISR. A pooled analysis of the Restenosis Intra-Stent of Drug-Eluting Stents: Drug-Eluting Balloon vs Everolimus-Eluting Stent (RIBS IV) and Restenosis Intra-Stent of Bare-Metal Stents: Drug-Eluting Balloon vs Everolimus-Eluting Stent (RIBS V) randomized trials was performed using patient-level data. In both trials, EESs were compared with DEBs in patients with ISR (RIBS V included 189 patients with bare-metal ISR; RIBS IV included 309 patients with drug-eluting ISR). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical in both trials. A total of 249 patients were allocated to EES and 249 to DEB. Clinical follow-up at 1 year was obtained in all (100%) patients and late angiography (median 249 days) in 91% of eligible patients. Compared with patients treated with DEBs, patients treated with EESs obtained better short-term results (postprocedural minimal lumen diameter 2.28 Â± 0.5 vs 2.12 Â± 0.4 mm, p <0.0001). At follow-up, patients treated with EESs had larger in-segment minimal lumen diameter (primary end point 2.16 Â± 0.7 vs 1.88 Â± 0.6 mm, p <0.0001; absolute mean difference 0.28 mm; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.40) and net lumen gain (1.33 Â± 0.6 vs 1.00 Â± 0.7 mm, p <0.0001) and had lower %diameter stenosis (19 Â± 21% vs 28 Â± 22%, p <0.0001) and binary restenosis rate (8.7% vs 15.7%, p = 0.02). Consistent results were observed in the in-lesion analysis. No interactions were found between the underlying stent type and treatment effects. At 1-year clinical follow-up, the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization was significantly reduced in the EES arm (8.8% vs 14.5%, p = 0.03; hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.94) mainly driven by a lower need for target vessel revascularization (6% vs 12.4%, p\n\nImpact of stent length on clinical outcomes of first-generation and new-generation drug-eluting stents.\n\nPubMed\n\nKonishi, Hirokazu; Miyauchi, Katsumi; Dohi, Tomotaka; Tsuboi, Shuta; Ogita, Manabu; Naito, Ryo; Kasai, Takatoshi; Tamura, Hiroshi; Okazaki, Shinya; Isoda, Kikuo; Daida, Hiroyuki\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare first- and new-generation drug-eluting stents (DESs) which are implanted in long lesion. Stent length is known to be a predictor of adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), even with the first-generation DESs. The introduction of new-generation DESs has reduced the rates of adverse clinical events. However, the impact of stent length on long-term clinical outcomes is not well known. A total of 1181 consecutive patients who underwent PCI using either a first-generation DES (nÂ =Â 885) or a new-generation DES (nÂ =Â 296) between 2004 and 2011 were investigated. In each of the stent groups, the patients were divided into two groups by stent length (>32 and â¤32Â mm) and compared. During the follow-up period, the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) was significantly higher for patients with long stents implanted than with short stents (PÂ <Â 0.01; log-rank test) in the first-generation DES group. However, there was no difference in the incidence of MACEs between the long- and short-stent groups in the new-generation DES group (PÂ =Â 0.24; log-rank test). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, stent length was not associated with adverse events in the new-generation DES groups [hazard ratio (HR) 0.87; 95Â % confidence interval (95Â % CI) 0.71-1.04; PÂ =Â 0.14]. Implanted stent length was significantly associated with a higher risk of MACEs in patients who received first-generation DESs, but not in patients who received the new-generation DESs.\n\nUse of drug-eluting stents in Victorian public hospitals.\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Bryan P; Ajani, Andrew E; Duffy, Stephen J; New, Gishel; Horrigan, Mark; Szto, Gregory; Walton, Antony; Eccleston, David; Lefkovits, Jeffery; Black, Alexander; Sebastian, Martin; Brennan, Angela L; Reid, Christopher M; Clark, David J\n\n2006-10-02\n\nWe aimed to assess the pattern of use of drug-eluting stents (DESs) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in Victorian public hospitals. Prospective study comparing the use of one or more DESs versus bare-metal stents (BMSs) only, in consecutive patients undergoing 2428 PCIs with stent implantation from 1 April 2004 to 31 December 2005 at seven Victorian public hospitals. Adherence to current Victorian Department of Human Services guidelines which recommend DES use in patients with high-risk features for restenosis (diabetes, small vessels, long lesions, in-stent restenotic lesions, chronic total occlusions and bifurcation lesions). Of the 2428 PCIs performed, at least one DES was implanted in 1101 (45.3%) and BMSs only were implanted in 1327 (54.7%). In 87.7% (966/1101) of PCI with DESs, there was at least one criterion for high risk of restenosis. DESs were more likely to be used in patients with diabetes (risk ratio [RR], 2.45; 95% CI, 2.02-2.97), small vessels (RR, 3.35; 95%CI, 2.35-4.76), long lesions (RR, 3.87; 95% CI, 3.23-4.65), in-stent restenotic lesions (RR, 3.98; 95%CI, 2.67-6.06), chronic total occlusions (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.51-2.88) and bifurcation lesions (RR, 2.23; 95%CI, 1.57-3.17). However, 66.2% (1608/2428) of all PCIs were in patients eligible for DESs according to Victorian guidelines, and in 39.9% (642/1608) of these PCIs, a BMS was used. In Victorian public hospitals, DESs have been largely reserved for patients at high risk of restenosis in accordance with Department of Human Services guidelines. However, many patients with high-risk criteria for restenosis did not receive DESs. Greater use of DESs in these patients may improve outcomes by reducing the need for repeat revascularisation.\n\nImpact of the Distance from the Stent Edge to the Residual Plaque on Edge Restenosis following Everolimus-Eluting Stent Implantation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMyojo, Masahiro; Sawaki, Daigo; Iwata, Hiroshi; Kiyosue, Arihiro; Higashikuni, Yasutomi; Tanaka, Tomofumi; Fujita, Daishi; Ando, Jiro; Fujita, Hideo; Hirata, Yasunobu; Komuro, Issei\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives This study aimed to assess the relation between stent edge restenosis (SER) and the distance from the stent edge to the residual plaque using quantitative intravascular ultrasound.
