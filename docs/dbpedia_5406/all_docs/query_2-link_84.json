An unblinded multicentred randomised controlled trial. A total of 1543 women were randomised from 68 centres in 21 countries. Women with a singleton breech fetus at a gestational age of 33(0/7) weeks (231 days) to 35(6/7) weeks (251 days) of gestation were included. Participants were randomly assigned to having a first ECV procedure between the gestational ages of 34(0/7) (238 days) and 35(6/7) weeks of gestation (early ECV group) or at or after 37(0/7) (259 days) weeks of gestation (delayed ECV group). The primary outcome was the rate of caesarean section; the secondary outcome was the rate of preterm birth. Fewer fetuses were in a non-cephalic presentation at birth in the early ECV group (314/765 [41.1%] versus 377/768 [49.1%] in the delayed ECV group; relative risk [RR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.94, P=0.002). There were no differences in rates of caesarean section (398/765 [52.0%] versus 430/768 [56.0%]; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85, 1.02, P=0.12) or in risk of preterm birth (50/765 [6.5%] versus 34/768 [4.4%]; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97, 2.26, P=0.07) between groups. External cephalic version at 34-35 weeks versus 37 or more weeks of gestation increases the likelihood of cephalic presentation at birth but does not reduce the rate of caesarean section and may increase the rate of preterm birth.

A retrospective study was conducted over a 3-year period from 2005-2007, where 101 patients who had singleton breech presentation at term were undergoing external cephalic version (ECV) after 37 weeks of gestation at two major teaching hospitals in the North of Jordan. Comparative analysis was made between the successful ECV and unsuccessful ECV groups. The collected data were analysed by using statistical analysis Sudent's t-test and Mann-Whitney test as appropriate and on discrete results chi square or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. The differences were considered significant at a p value of breeches (74% vs 26%, p = 0.002), posterior placenta (38.6% vs 16.4%, p = 0.0001) and anterior fetal back (53.4% vs 34.8%, p = 0.03). Once turned the babies remained cephalic until delivery. All the 28 cases who had failed ECV had caesarean section. Among those who had a successful external cephalic version, the incidence of intrapartum caesarean section was only 8.2% which was lower than that of the average of both units caesarean rate (28%). There were no complications related to the ECV procedure in the study. Multiparity, flexed breech, posterior placenta, and anterior foetal back were the most favourable factors for successful ECV in our study. Moreover, with careful evaluation of individual predictors patient selection and success rates can be optimised.\n\nLabour Outcomes After Successful External Cephalic Version Compared With Spontaneous Cephalic Version.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKrueger, Samantha; Simioni, Julia; Griffith, Lauren E; Hutton, Eileen K\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis study sought to compare obstetrical outcomes for women with a cephalic presentation at birth resulting from successful external cephalic version (ECV) compared to those resulting from spontaneous cephalic version (SCV). Secondary analysis was performed on Early External Cephalic Version Trial data. A total of 931 study participants had breech presentations between 34 and 36 weeks' gestation and cephalic presentations at birth. The incidence of intrapartum interventions was compared between patients with successful ECV (557) and those with SCV (374). A generalized linear mixed model was used to determine ORs for our primary outcomes. Parity, maternal BMI, previous CS, and enrolment centre were controlled for in the analysis. No differences were found after ECV compared with SCV in the incidence of CS (96 of 557 and 76 of 374, respectively; adjusted OR [aOR] 0.89; 95% CI 0.63-1.26), instrumental birth (68 of 557 and 29 of 373, respectively; aOR 1.55; 95% CI 0.96-2.50), or normal vaginal birth (393 of 557 and 268 of 373, respectively; aOR 0.92; 95% CI 0.68-1.24). Multiparous women with successful ECV were half as likely to require a CS compared with those with SCV and no ECV (28 of 313 and 42 of 258, respectively; aOR 0.45;Â 95% CI 0.26-0.80). This is the first study to compare birth outcomes of breech pregnancies that convert to cephalic presentation by means of SCV with birth outcomes of breech pregnancies that have ECV. Women with a cephalic-presenting fetus at birth as a result of successful ECV are not at greater risk of obstetrical interventions at birth when compared with women with fetuses who spontaneously turn to a cephalic presentation in the third trimester.

This is an interim analysis of an ongoing larger prospective off-centre randomised trial, which compares a clinical hypnosis intervention against neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) of women with a singleton breech foetus at or after 37(0/7) (259 days) weeks of gestation and normal amniotic fluid index. Main outcome measures were delivery mode and neonatal outcome. On the same day after the ECV procedure two patients (2 %), who had unsuccessful ECVs, had Caesarean sections (one due to vaginal bleeding and one due to pathological CTG). After the ECV procedure 40.4 % of women had cephalic presentation (n = 38) and 58.5 % (n = 55) remained breech presentation. One patient remained transverse presentation (n = 1; 1.1 %). Vaginal delivery was observed by 73.7 % of cephalic presentation (n = 28), whereas 26.3 % (n = 10) had in-labour Caesarean sections. Of those, who selected a trial of vaginal breech delivery, 42.4 % (n = 14) delivered vaginally and 57.6 % (n = 19) delivered via Caesarean section. There is a statistically significant difference between the rate of vaginal birth between cephalic presentation and trial of vaginal breech delivery (p = 0.009), however, no difference in neonatal outcome was observed. ECV is a safe procedure and can reduce not only the rate of elective Caesarean sections due to breech presentation but also the rate of in-labour Caesarean sections even if a trial of vaginal breech delivery is attempted.\n\nTocolysis in term breech external cephalic version.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNor Azlin, M I; Haliza, H; Mahdy, Z A; Anson, I; Fahya, M N; Jamil, M A\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTo study the effect of ritodrine tocolysis on the success of external cephalic version (ECV) and to assess the role of ECV in breech presentation at our centre. A prospective randomized double-blind-controlled trial comparing ritodrine and placebo in ECV of singleton term breech pregnancy at a tertiary hospital. Among the 60 patients who were recruited, there was a success rate of 36.7%. Ritodrine tocolysis significantly improved the success rate of ECV (50% vs. 23%; P=0.032). There was a marked effect of ritodrine tocolysis on the ECV success in nulliparae (36.4% vs. 13.0%) and multiparae (87.5% vs. 57.1%). External cephalic version has shown to reduce the rate of cesarean section for breech presentation by 33.5% in our unit. External cephalic version significantly reduced the rate of cesarean section in breech presentation, and ritodrine tocolysis improved the success of ECV and should be offered to both nulliparous and parous women in the case of term breech presentation.\n\nAnalgesia/anesthesia for external cephalic version.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWeiniger, Carolyn F\n\n2013-06-01\n\nProfessional society guidelines recommend that women with breech presentation be delivered surgically due to a higher incidence of fetal risks compared with vaginal delivery. An alternative is attempted external cephalic version, which if successful, enables attempted vaginal delivery. Attitudes towards external cephalic version (ECV) will be considered in this review, along with pain relief methods and their impact on ECV success rates. Articles suggest that ECV is infrequently offered, due to both physician and patient factors. Success of ECV is higher in multiparous women, complete breech, posterior placenta, or smaller fetus. Preterm ECV performance does not increase vaginal delivery rates. Neuraxial techniques (spinal or epidural) significantly increase ECV success rates, as do moxibustion and hypnosis. Four reviews summarized studies considering ECV and neuraxial techniques. These reviews suggest that neuraxial techniques using high (surgical) doses of local anesthetic are efficacious compared with control groups not using anesthesia, whereas techniques using low-doses are not. Low-dose versus high-dose neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia has not been directly compared in a single study. Based on currently available data, the rate of cephalic presentation is not increased using neuraxial techniques, but vaginal delivery rates are higher. ECV appears to be a low-risk procedure. The logistics of routine ECV and provision of optimal neuraxial techniques for successful ECV require additional research. Safety aspects of neuraxial anesthesia for ECV require further investigation.\n\nObstetric and Anesthetic Approaches to External Cephalic Version.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLim, Stephanie; Lucero, Jennifer\n\n2017-03-01\n\nBreech presentation is the most common abnormal fetal presentation and complicates approximately 3% to 4% of all pregnancies. External cephalic version (ECV) should be recommended to women with a breech singleton pregnancy, if there is no maternal or fetal contraindication. ECV increases the chance of cephalic presentation at the onset of labor and decreases the rate of cesarean delivery by almost 40%. The success rate of ECV is approximately 60%. Review of the risks and benefits for performing an ECV and for both the timing of ECV and the number of attempts should be should be discussed with the patient. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Trial\n\nThe relation between umbilical cord characteristics and the outcome of external cephalic version.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKuppens, Simone M I; Waerenburgh, Evelyne R; Kooistra, Libbe; van der Donk, Riet W P; Hasaart, Tom H M; Pop, Victor J M\n\n2011-05-01\n\nUmbilical cords of fetuses in breech presentation differ in length and coiling from their cephalic counterparts and it might be hypothesised that these cord characteristics may in turn affect ECV outcome. To investigate the relation between umbilical cord characteristics and the outcome of external cephalic version (ECV). Prospective cohort study. Women (>35 weeks gestation) with a singleton fetus in breech presentation, suitable for external cephalic version. Demographic, lifestyle and obstetrical parameters were assessed at intake. ECV success was based on cephalic presentation on ultrasound post-ECV. Umbilical cord length (UCL) and umbilical coiling index (UCI) were measured after birth. The relation between umbilical cord characteristics (cord length and coiling) and the success of external cephalic version. ECV success rate was overall 79/146 (54%), for multiparas 37/46(80%) and for nulliparas 42/100 (42%). Multiple logistic regression showed that UCL (OR: 1.04, CI: 1.01-1.07), nulliparity (OR: 0.20, CI: 0.08-0.51), frank breech (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.90), body mass index (OR: 0.85, CI: 0.76-0.95), placenta anterior (OR: 0.27, CI: 0.12-0.63) and birth weight (OR: 1.002, CI: 1.001-1.003) were all independently related to ECV success. Umbilical cord length is independently related to the outcome of ECV, whereas umbilical coiling index is not. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Data of the Netherlands perinatal registry for the matched cohort. singleton pregnancies from January 2011 to August 2012 with a fetus in breech presentation and a childbirth from 36 weeks gestation onwards. Spontaneous cephalic presentations (selected from national registry 2009 and 2010) were matched in a 2:1 ratio to cephalic presentations after a successful version attempt. Matching criteria were maternal age, parity, gestational age at childbirth and fetal gender. Main outcomes were mode of childbirth and neonatal outcomes. of 1613 women eligible for external cephalic version, 1169 (72.5%) received an ECV attempt. The overall caesarean childbirth rate was significantly lower compared to women who did not receive a version attempt (57% versus 87%; RR 0.66 (0.62-0.70)). Women with a cephalic presentation after ECV compared to women with a spontaneous cephalic presentation had a decreased risk for instrumental vaginal childbirth (RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.29-0.94)) and an increased risk of overall caesarean childbirth (RR 1.7 (95%CI 1.2-2.5)). women who had a successful ECV are at increased risk for a caesarean childbirth but overall, ECV is an important tool to reduce the caesarean rate. ECV is an important tool to reduce the caesarean section rates. Copyright Â© 2016.

Retrospective study between 1998-2015Â comparing in the cord accident diagnosed at delivery (by midwife or doctors according to mode of delivery): Patients with attempt ECV: Group 1Â cephalic presentation after successful ECV with trial of labor, and Group 2Â failed ECV followed by elective cesarean or trial of labor. Patients with no attempt ECV Group 3Â spontaneous cephalic presentation matching for delivery date, maternal age, parity, body mass index, and delivery history with group 1, Group 4Â Breech presentation without attempt ECV with trial of labor. A total of 776Â women with breech presentation were included (198Â in group 1, 446Â in group 2, 396Â in group 3Â and 118Â in group 4). The prevalence of cord accident did not differ according to ECV attempt (17.08Â % versus 18.9Â %), to cephalic presentation (group 1: 24.7Â % versus group 3: 25Â %) and to breech presentation (group 2: 16.9Â % versus group 4: 17.2Â %). The trial of labor after failed ECV did not increase the risk of cord accident when compared with elective cesarean (17.4Â % versus 16Â %). A prolapse cord was only observed after trial of labor, i.e. in groups 1, 2Â and 4Â without difference (respectively 1, 0.8Â and 1.7Â %). In each group, the rate of cesarean was not different according to the presence of nuchal cord. Success or failed External cephalic version is not associated with an increased risk of cord accident.

Compared with ECV at term, beginning ECV prior to 37Â weeks' gestation decreases the number of infants in a non-cephalic presentation at birth. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to investigate factors associated with a successful ECV procedure and to present this in a clinically useful format. Data were collected as part of the Early ECV Pilot and Early ECV2 Trials, which randomized 1776 women with a fetus in breech presentation to either early ECV (34-36Â weeks' gestation) or delayed ECV (at or after 37Â weeks). The outcome of interest was successful ECV, defined as the fetus being in a cephalic presentation immediately following the procedure, as well as at the time of birth. The importance of several factors in predicting successful ECV was investigated using two statistical methods: logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses. Among nulliparas, non-engagement of the presenting part and an easily palpable fetal head were independently associated with success. Among multiparas, non-engagement of the presenting part, gestation less than 37Â weeks and an easily palpable fetal head were found to be independent predictors of success. These findings were consistent with results of the CART analyses. Regardless of parity, descent of the presenting part was the most discriminating factor in predicting successful ECV and cephalic presentation at birth.

We performed a retrospective cohort study including patients with successful ECV following fetal breech position (ECV cohort, n = 47) or with a singleton spontaneous cephalic pregnancy at â¥37 weeks of gestational age (control group, n = 7,456) attempting a vaginal delivery between 2010 and 2013 at the University Hospital Ulm. The mode of delivery and fetal outcome parameters were compared between these 2 groups using nonparametric statistics. ECV cohort and control group did not differ with respect to maternal age, parity, gestational age at birth, and fetal gender. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to all parameters indicating fetal outcome. However, the rate of cesarean sections was higher after successful ECV compared to spontaneous cephalic presentation (27.7 vs. 12.8%, OR 2.615). While vaginal delivery is less likely to happen after a successful ECV compared to spontaneous cephalic singleton pregnancies, fetal outcome parameters showed no difference between the 2 groups. Physicians should be counseling and encouraging women to attempt ECV, as it is a safe and effective procedure. Â© 2017 S.

Retrospective study on n = 131 women with breech presentation comparing maternal satisfaction after ECV and consecutive childbirth (n = 66; 50.4% of these successful attempts in n = 33; 50%) against the group without ECV and primary caesarean section (CS) (n = 65; 49.6%) instead using a questionnaire. Women with successful ECV tolerated side effects of the intervention better than after unsuccessful ECV (pain, tocolytics, mental and physical state, for all p version were more satisfied with childbirth than women with planned CS (p = 0.05). Women with version attempts tend to perceive childbirth as being less problematic with fewer complications (9.5 vs. 19%, p = 0.12). Unsuccessful ECVs had no negative impact on satisfaction with childbirth (p = 0.072). Attempting ECV seems to be an option for increasing the rate of vaginal births with breech presentation without negative impact on maternal satisfaction regarding consecutive childbirth.\n\nThe Cost Implications in Ontario, Alberta, andÂ British Columbia of Early Versus Delayed External Cephalic Version in the Early External Cephalic Version 2 (EECV2) Trial.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAhmed, Rashid J; Gafni, Amiram; Hutton, Eileen K\n\n2016-03-01\n\nAccording to the Early External Cephalic Version (EECV2) Trial, planning external cephalic version (ECV) early in pregnancy results in fewer breech presentations at delivery compared with delayed external cephalic version. A Cochrane review conducted after the EECV2 Trial identified an increase in preterm birth associated with early ECV. We examined whether a policy of routine early ECV (i.e., before 37 weeks' gestation) is more or less costly than a policy of delayed ECV. We undertook this analysis from the perspective of a third-party payer (Ministry of Health). We applied data, using resources reported in the EECV2 Trial, to the Canadian context using 10 hospital unit costs and 17 physician service/procedure unit costs. The data were derived from the provincial health insurance plan schedule of medical benefits in three Canadian provinces (Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia). The difference in mean total costs between study groups was tested for each province separately. We found that planning early ECV results in higher costs than planning delayed ECV. The mean costs of all physician services/procedures and hospital units for planned ECV compared with delayed ECV were $7997.32 versus $7263.04 in Ontario (P < 0.001), $8162.82 versus $7410.55 in Alberta (P < 0.001), and $8178.92 versus $7417.04 in British Columbia (P < 0.001), respectively. From the perspective of overall cost, our analyses do not support a policy of routinely planning ECV before 37 weeks' gestation.

Our objective was to determine the rate of cephalic vaginal delivery in women undergoing ECV after PROM. We performed a systematic review of all case reports, case series and clinical trials of patients undergoing an ECV after PROMââ¥â24 weeks. Maternal demographics and outcome data were obtained. The primary outcome was rate of cephalic vaginal delivery. Statistical analysis was performed for continuous outcomes by calculating mean and standard deviations for appropriate variables. The systematic review yielded six papers with 13 case reports and no clinical trials of ECV after PROM. The rate of success to cephalic presentation was 46.1% (six of 13 cases), with a subsequent vaginal delivery rate of 23.1% (three of 13 cases). The rate of umbilical cord prolapse was 33.3% (two of six cases). ECV after PROM has been reported in 13 cases in the literature. For the cases reported, 46.1% of ECV were successful in turning to cephalic position, but only 23.1% resulted in a vaginal delivery. There was a 33.3% incidence of umbilical cord prolapse. Given the high rate of umbilical cord prolapse, it would be imperative to offer an ECV in the setting of PROM only at an institution that has the ability to perform the indicated emergent cesarean delivery and only after appropriate counseling.\n\nContraindications for external cephalic version in breech position at term: a systematic review\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRosman, Ageeth N.; Guijt, Aline; Vlemmix, Floortje; Rijnders, Marlies; Mol, Ben W.

ECV may reduce the number of breech presentations and caesarean sections, but there also have been reports of complications with the procedure. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of ECV at or near term on measures of pregnancy outcome. Methods of facilitating ECV, and ECV before term are reviewed separately. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (28 February 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised trials of ECV at or near term (with or without tocolysis) compared with no attempt at ECV in women with breech presentation. Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality, and extracted the data. We included eight studies, with a total of 1308 women randomised. The pooled data from these studies show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in non-cephalic presentation at birth (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.61, eight trials, 1305 women); vaginal cephalic birth not achieved (average RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.62, seven trials, 1253 women, evidence graded very low); and caesarean section (average RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.82, eight trials, 1305 women, evidence graded very low) when ECV was attempted in comparison to no ECV attempted. There were no significant differences in the incidence of Apgar score ratings below seven at one minute (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.37, three trials, 168 infants) or five minutes (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.36, five trials, 428 infants, evidence graded very low), low umbilical vein pH levels (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.44, one trial, 52 infants, evidence graded very low), neonatal admission (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.34, four trials, 368 infants, evidence graded very low), perinatal death (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64, eight trials, 1305 infants\n\nMode of delivery following successful external cephalic version: comparison with spontaneous cephalic presentations at delivery.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKuppens, Simone M I; Hutton, Eileen K; Hasaart, Tom H M; Aichi, Nassira; Wijnen, Henrica A; Pop, Victor J M\n\n2013-10-01\n\nTo compare the obstetric outcomes of pregnant women after successful external cephalic version (ECV) (cases) with a large group of pregnant women with a spontaneously occurring cephalic fetal position at delivery (controls). We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study in a teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Delivery outcomes of women with a successful ECV were compared with those of women with spontaneously occurring cephalic presentations, controlling for maternal age, parity, gestational age at delivery, and onset of labour (spontaneous or induced). Exclusion criteria were a history of Caesarean section, delivery at < 35 weeks, and elective Caesarean section. The primary outcome was the prevalence of Caesarean section and instrumental delivery in both groups; secondary outcomes were the characteristics of cases requiring intervention such as Caesarean section or instrumental delivery. Women who had a successful ECV had a significantly higher Caesarean section rate than the women in the control group (33/220 [15%] vs. 62/1030 [6.0 %]; P < 0.001). There was no difference in the incidence of instrumental delivery (20/220 [9.1%] vs. 103/1030 [10%]). Comparison of characteristics of women in the cases group showed that nulliparity, induction of labour, and occiput posterior presentation were associated with Caesarean section and instrumental deliveries. Compared with delivery of spontaneous cephalic presenta-tions, delivery of cephalic presenting babies following successful ECV is associated with an increased rate of Caesarean section, especially in nulliparous women and women whose labour is induced.\n\n[Fewer breech deliveries after implementation of a modified cephalic version protocol].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKuppens, Simone M I; Francois, Anne M H; Hasaart, Tom H M; van der Donk, Maria W P; Pop, Victor J M\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTo investigate the effect of implementation of a number of process policy guidelines (protocol), on the success rate of external cephalic version (ECV) for breech presentation. Prospective study. During a 3-year period (2004-2006) a standardized protocol for an ECV consultation was developed, evaluated and adapted. After implementing this modified protocol as 'process policy guidelines', the effect on the rate of successful ECV was prospectively evaluated during the period 1 January 2007-31 July 2008. Success was defined as cephalic presentation (ultrasound) immediately after ECV. A secondary outcome measure was the elective caesarean section rate for breech presentation. The rate of successful ECV increased significantly from 47% (110/236 pregnant women) in the period January 2004-December 2006 to 61% (85/139, p = 0.006) in the period January 2007-July 2008. Patient characteristics were similar in both groups, with the exception of 2 subgroups of term of version. The increase was preferentially found in nulliparous and multiparous women with frank breech. Nulliparity, frank breech, anterior placenta and low birth weight were associated with a lower success rate of ECV. The term of pregnancy at which ECV was performed did not seem to affect the success rate. Implementing the process policy guidelines increased the number of cephalic presentations at delivery and decreased the rate of elective caesarean sections for breech presentation from 39% to 27% (p = 0.03). The number needed to treat to prevent 1 elective caesarean section by ECV according to the process policy guidelines was 8. After implementation of the process policy guidelines, the success rate of ECV increased considerably. The rate of elective caesarean section for breech presentation declined. These findings are in favour of establishing specialized ECV centres in the Netherlands.\n\nExternal cephalic version experiences in Korea.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKim, Mi-Young; Park, Min-Young; Kim, Gwang Jun\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate obstetric outcomes of external cephalic version (ECV) performed at or near term. Single pregnant woman with breech presentation at or near term (n=145), who experienced ECV by one obstetrician from November 2009 to July 2014 in our institution were included in the study. Maternal baseline characteristic and fetal ultrasonographic variables were checked before the procedure. After ECV, the delivery outcomes of the women were gathered. Variables affecting the success or failure of ECV were evaluated. Success rate of ECV was 71.0% (n=103). Four variables (parity, amniotic fluid index, fetal spine position and rotational direction) were observed to be in correlation with success or failure of ECV. In contactable 83 individuals experienced successful ECV, cesarean delivery rates were 18.1%, 28.9%, and 5.3% in total, nulliparas, and multiparas, respectively. Based on the results, ECV is proposed to be safe for both mother and her fetus. In addition, it is a valuable procedure that increases probability of vaginal delivery for women with breech presentation.\n\nExternal cephalic version experiences in Korea\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKim, Mi-Young; Park, Min-Young\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective The aim of this study was to evaluate obstetric outcomes of external cephalic version (ECV) performed at or near term.

For this reason, pregnant dams at our institution typically undergo cesarean delivery for known breech presentation, leading to problems with maternal-infant bonding and increased nursery utilization. This paper describes a simple, non-invasive technique called external cephalic version (ECV) that effectively converts the baboon breech fetus into a cephalic presentation. ECV was successful in each of seven attempted cases, with the consistent development of contractions and vaginal bleeding leading to the delivery of a healthy liveborn infant within 72 hours. ECV may offer a safe and effective alternative to cesarean section for delivery of the breech baboon fetus.\n\nContraindications for external cephalic version in breech position at term: A systematic review\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRosman, A.N.; Guijt, A.; Vlemmix, F.; Rijnders, M.; Mol, B.W.J.; Kok, M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjective.

Prospective study conducted in the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven between October 2007 and May 2012. Participants fulfilled The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) questionnaire and expressed their degree of fear on a visual analogue scale from one to ten before ECV. Obstetric factors were evaluated as well. Primary outcome was the relation between psychological factors (fear for ECV and depression EDS scores) and ECV success rate. Secondary outcome was a possible relation between fear for ECV and increased abdominal muscle tension. The overall success rate was 55% and was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in nulliparous women (44.3%) compared with parous women (78.0%). Fear for ECV and depression EDS-scores were not related with ECV success rate. Parity, placental location, BMI and engagement of the fetal breech were obstetric factors associated with ECV outcome. There was no relation between fear for ECV and abdominal muscle tone. Fear for ECV and depression were not related with ECV success rate in this study. Engagement of the fetal breech was the most important factor associated with a successful ECV.

This review examines studies initiating ECV prior to term (before 37 weeks' gestation). To assess the effectiveness of a policy of beginning ECV before term (before 37 weeks' gestation) for breech presentation on fetal presentation at birth, method of delivery, and the rate of preterm birth, perinatal morbidity, stillbirth or neonatal mortality. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ECV attempted before term (37 weeks' gestation) or commenced before term, compared with a control group of women (in breech presentation) in which either no ECV attempted or ECV was attempted at term. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi-RCTs or studies using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked for accuracy. Studies were assessed for risk of bias and for important outcomes the overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Five studies are included (2187 women). It was not possible for the intervention to be blinded, and it is not clear what impact lack of blinding would have on the outcomes reported. For other 'Risk of bias' domains studies were either at low or unclear risk of bias.One study reported on ECV that was undertaken and completed before 37 weeks' gestation compared with no ECV. No difference was found in the rate of non-cephalic presentation at birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.69; participants = 102).

This open randomized controlled trial was planned with a sequential design. Women at a term â¥36Â weeks of gestation with a singleton fetus in breech presentation and a first unsuccessful ECV were recruited in two level-3 maternity units. They were randomly allocated to transabdominal amnioinfusion with a 500-mL saline solution under ultrasound surveillance or no amnioinfusion before the second ECV attempt. Trained senior obstetricians performed all procedures. The primary outcome was the cephalic presentation rate at delivery. Analyses were conducted according to intention to treat (NCT00465712). Recruitment difficulties led to stopping the trial after a 57-month period, 119 women were randomized: 59 allocated to amnioinfusionâ+âECV and 60 to ECV only. Data were analyzed without applying the sequential feature of the design. The rate of cephalic presentation at delivery did not differ significantly according to whether the second version attempt was or was not preceded by amnioinfusion (20 versus 12%, pâ=â.20). Premature rupture of the membranes occurred for 15% of the women in the amnioinfusion group. Amnioinfusion before a second attempt to external version does not significantly increase the rate of cephalic presentation at delivery.\n\nPractice Bulletin No. 161: External Cephalic Version.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2016-02-01\n\nIn the United States, there is a widespread belief that the overall cesarean delivery rate is higher than necessary.

A retrospective matched case-control study was conducted at a hospital in Lisbon, Portugal, between 2002 and 2012. Each woman who underwent successful ECV (n = 44) was compared with the previous and next women who presented for labor management and who had the same parity and a singleton vertex pregnancy at term (n = 88). The outcome measures were route of delivery, indications for cesarean delivery, and incidence of nonreassuring fetal status. Attempts at ECV were successful in 62 (46%) of 134 women, and 44 women whose fetuses remained in a cephalic presentation until delivery were included in the study. The rates of intrapartum cesarean delivery and operative vaginal delivery did not differ significantly between cases and controls (intrapartum cesarean delivery, 9 [20%] vs 16 [18%], P = 0.75; operative vaginal delivery, 14 [32%] vs 19 [22%], P = 0.20). The indications for cesarean delivery after successful ECV did not differ; in both groups, cesarean delivery was mainly performed for labor arrest disorders (cases, 6 [67%] vs controls, 13 [81%]; P = 0.63). Successful ECV was not associated with increased rates of intrapartum cesarean delivery or operative vaginal delivery. Copyright Â© 2014 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

To determine the maternal and fetal outcomes of successful external cephalic version (ECV) as well as factors predicting vaginal birth. Methods. The ECV data over a period of three years at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) between 1 September 2008 and 30 September 2010 was reviewed. Sixty-seven patients who had successful ECV were studied and reviewed for maternal, fetal, and labour outcomes. The control group comprised patients with cephalic singletons of matching parity who delivered following the index cases. Results. The mean gestational age at ECV was 263 Â± 6.52âdays (37.5 weeks Â± 6.52 days). Spontaneous labour and transient cardiotocographic (CTG) changes were the commonest early adverse effects following ECV. The reversion rate was 7.46%. The mean gestational age at delivery of the two groups was significantly different (P = 0.000) with 277.9 Â± 8.91 days and 269.9 Â± 9.68 days in the study group and control groups, respectively. The study group needed significantly more inductions of labour. They required more operative deliveries, had more blood loss at delivery, a higher incidence of meconium-stained liquor, and more cord around the neck. Previous flexed breeches had a threefold increase in caesarean section rate compared to previous extended breeches (44.1% versus 15.2%, P = 0.010). On the contrary, an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 13 or more is significantly associated with a higher rate of vaginal birth (86.8% versus 48.3%, P = 0.001). Conclusions. Patients with successful ECV were at higher risk of carrying the pregnancy beyond 40 weeks and needing induction of labour, with a higher rate of caesarean section and higher rates of obstetrics complications. Extended breech and AFI 13 or more were significantly more likely to deliver vaginally postsuccessful ECV.

This was a retrospective cohort study of outcomes following successful external cephalic version in 411 women at an Australian tertiary maternity unit between November 2008 and March 2015. The study cohort was compared with a control group of 1236 women with cephalic presentation who underwent spontaneous labor. Intrapartum intervention rates and adverse neonatal outcomes were compared between both groups. The success rate of external cephalic version (ECV) was 66.4%. The spontaneous vaginal delivery rate in the study cohort was 59.4% (224/411) vs 72.8% (900/1236) in the control cohort (P<0.001). Intrapartum intervention rates (emergency cesarean section (CS) and instrumental delivery) were higher in the ECV group (38% vs 27.2%, P<0.001). Rates of emergency CS for non-reassuring fetal status (9.5%, 39/411 vs 4.4%, 54/1236, Pâ©½0.001) and failure to progress (13.4%, 55/411 vs 4.1%, 51/1236, P<0.001) were higher in the study cohort. Neonatal outcomes were worse in the study cohort-Apgar score <7 at 5âmin (2.2%, 9/411 vs 0.6%, 8/1236, P<0.001) and abnormal cord gases (8.5%, 35/411 vs 0.2%, 3/1236, P<0.001). Rates for resuscitation at birth and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit were higher in the study cohort (6.1% vs 4.1% and 1.9% vs 1.1%, respectively) but these were not statistically significant.

Among 643 women who attempted ECV, we identified 198 with successful ECVs and compared them with the next two women who presented for labor management with spontaneous cephalic presentation, matching for delivery date, maternal age, parity, body mass index, and delivery history using univariate and stepwise logistic regression. The main outcome measure was the risk of caesarean. The caesarean section rate was higher after successful ECV (respectively 20.7% versus 7.07%, P<0.05). Caesarean section for abnormal fetal head position (forehead, bregma, face) was higher after successful ECV (28.6% versus 0%). After adjustment for matching and confounding variables (variation of the caesarean section rate over the study period, gestational maternal complications, antepartum fetal complications, term of delivery, induction of labor, oxytocin use for dystocia, neonatal cephalic perimeter), a successful ECV increased the risk of caesarean section (adjusted OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.86-5.46). By stratifying on week, a trend for increased risk for caesarean section was observed at the week after ECV and at post term (28.6% before 37+6, 14.8% at 38+0-38+6, 13.8% at 39+0-39+6, 14.2% at 40+0-40+6 and 33.3% beyond 41+0 weeks' gestation, P=0.06). Women who have a successful ECV are at increased risk of caesarean section compared with women who experience spontaneous cephalic presentation. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The aims of this retrospective cohort study were to evaluate the ECV and to identify factors associated with the success rate of ECV for breech presentation at term. The second aim of this study was to analyse the outcome of labour of all patients with a foetus in breech near term. All women with a foetus in breech near or at term were included. Logistic regression analyses were -performed to identify the association between patient characteristics and success rate of ECV. The overall rate of successful ECV's was 19%. Foetal and maternal complications after ECV were negligible. BMI, type of breech and amount of amniotic fluid were significantly correlated with a successful ECV. The rate of primary caesarean sections for the group of patients who underwent an ECV was lower than the rate in the group who did not (52.9% vs. 79.6%). The rate of spontaneous deliveries was increased after ECV (36% versus 12%). After successful ECV the rate of spontaneous deliveries was 75%; after unsuccessful ECV 26.8%. The overall rate of successful ECV was low (19%). BMI, type of breech and amount of amniotic fluid were significantly correlated with a successful ECV. The rate of primary caesarean sections was significantly lower in patients with ECV (52.9% versus 79.6%).

Retrospective review of the cohort of study was performed at the University Hospital of Getafe (Madrid, Spain) between January 2012 and January 2013. 1516 patients (48 cases; 1468 controls). We compared the type of delivery in pregnant women after ECV performed successfully (cases) with spontaneous cephalic presentations (controls). Pregnancies with vaginal delivery contraindicated, elective cesarean section (CS) justified by maternal disease, multiple pregnancies, or pregnancies below 37 weeks were excluded. Maternal age, BMI, parity, gestational age at delivery, and onset of labor (spontaneous or induced) were controlled. Prevalence of CS and operative delivery in both groups. Women who underwent a successful ECV had a significantly higher CS rate compared with the women of the control group (12/48 [25%] vs. 202/1468 [13.76%]; P=0.028). There was no difference in the rate of operative delivery (6/48 [12.5%] vs. 177/1468 [12.05%] P=0.92). Deliveries following a successful ECV are associated with an increased CS rate compared with deliveries of fetuses with spontaneous cephalic presentations.\n\nExternal cephalic version for breech presentation at term\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRauf, B.; Hassan, L.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTo assess the success rate of External Cephalic Version (ECV) at term and its effects on measures of pregnancy outcome. A total of 40 patients were offered ECV over a period of fourteen months. All singleton breech presentations with an otherwise normal antenatal course between 36-41 weeks of gestation were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included contraindications to ECV i.e. multiple pregnancy, oligohydramnios, growth retardation, antepartum hemorrhage, rupture of membranes toxemias of pregnancy, non-reassuring fetal monitoring pattern, previous uterine scar, bad obstetric history, any contraindication to vaginal delivery, labour and patient wishes after thorough counseling. Overall success rate of the procedure and its effect on maternal and fetal outcome was determined. Significance of results was determined using Chi-square test. A total of 40 patients were recruited for the trial. Overall success rate was 67.5% with only 30% being primi-gravida (p<0.05). Multi-gravida showed higher success rate of 80%. Following successful ECV, spontaneous vaginal delivery was attained in 77.7% (n=21), while caesarean section was performed due to various indications in about 6 cases (p<0.05). Following failed version, 61.5% (n=8) had elective C/S and only 5 delivered vaginally. Route of delivery did not affect the perinatal outcome except for congenital abnormalities. Following successful ECV, there was only one stillbirth. Overall live births associated with successful version was 96.2% (p<0.05), while in failed version, there were no fetal deaths. ECV at term appears to be a useful procedure to reduce the number and associated complications of term breech presentation. It is safe for the mother and the fetus and helps to avoid a significant number of caesarean sections.

This is a retrospective observational study with patients who did not want trying a breech vaginal delivery and decided trying an ECV with epidural analgesia at term and wanted labor induction or cesarean section after the procedure. We present the results of 40 ECV with epidural analgesia at term and labor induction or cesarean section just after the ECV. ECV succeeded in 26 out of 40 (65%) patients. Among the 26 successful ECV, 6 delivered by cesarean (23.1%). 20 patients delivered vaginally (76.9%; 50% of all patients). Considering that a high number of cesarean deliveries can be avoided, induction of labor after ECV with epidural analgesia at term can be considered after being discussed in selected patient.

A total of 1,543 women were randomized from 68 centers in 21 countries. The goal of this component of the trial was to understand women's views about participation in a research trial and timing of external cephalic version. A postpartum questionnaire was completed containing a 5-point Likert scale examining contact and availability of staff, choice of timing of external cephalic version, preference of randomization, convenience of participating, and overall satisfaction. Participants also completed two open-ended questions related to timing of external cephalic version and satisfaction with the trial. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyze data. A total of 1,458 women completed the questionnaire, of whom 86 percent said \"yes\"-they would participate in the trial again. Themes influencing decisions about participating were perceptions of the external cephalic version experience, preferred mode of delivery, preferred timing of external cephalic version, and perceptions of the effectiveness of external cephalic version and of the trial environment. Many participants preferred the early timing of the procedure offered through the trial because of perceived advantages of a smaller baby being easier to turn and the opportunity for repeat procedures. Women were positive about their participation in the trial. Early external cephalic version was preferred over the traditional timing as it was perceived to afford both physiologic and practical advantages. Â© 2012, Copyright the Authors.

In a prospective study, data were obtained for ECV procedures performed at Cruces University Hospital, Spain, between March 2002 and June 2012. Women with a singleton pregnancy who had a successful, uncomplicated ECV and whose delivery was assisted at the study hospital, with the fetus in cephalic presentation, were included. A multivariate model of risk factors of cesarean delivery was developed. Among 627 women included, 92 (14.7%) delivered by cesarean. A cesarean was performed among 33 (8.5%) of 387 women with spontaneous labor versus 59 (24.6%) of 240 who were induced (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that higher BMI (P = 0.006), labor induction (P = 0.001), and prior cesarean (P < 0.001) were associated with cesarean. Time between ECV and delivery was inversely associated with probability of cesarean during the first 2 weeks. Thus, the probabilities of cesarean delivery on the first day were 0.53 (95% CI 0.35-0.71) and 0.34 (95% CI 0.18-0.51) following induced and spontaneous labor, respectively. On the seventh day, the probabilities were 0.23 (95% CI 0.15-0.32) and 0.12 (95% CI 0.07-0.18), respectively. Following ECV, induction of labor, an interval of less than 2 weeks to delivery, BMI, and previous cesarean were associated with an increased risk of cesarean.

Breech presentation is associated with DDH. This risk factor can be modified by external cephalic version (ECV). The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of DDH in patients who successfully underwent ECV, as well as to evaluate need for these children (breech for a period during gestation) to be included in the DDH screening protocol. A prospective cohort study was conducted in the Hospital Universitario de Vigo from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. It included children born in cephalic presentation after a successful ECV, as well as children born in breech presentation. They all were screened for DDH by ultrasound examination of the hip. Out of a total of 122 newborns included in the study, ECV was attempted on 67 (54.9%), of which 35 (52.2%) were successful. Out of the 14 children diagnosed with DDH, 3 of those born in cephalic presentation after a successful ECV were found to be normal on physical examination. Successful ECV is associated with a lower incidence of DDH as regards breech presentation. However, these patients should be included in the DDH screening protocol for the early detection of this disorder. Copyright Â© 2017 AsociaciÃ³n EspaÃ±ola de PediatrÃ­a.

From 2004 to 2008, 212 pregnant women between 34-37 weeks of gestation with fetus in breech presentation were included in a randomized clinical trial and 125 externals cephalic versions were studied. A success rate of 37.6%t was recorded. At 34 weeks of gestation, 80.6% of women were considering an ECV in the event of persistent breech position at 37 weeks. These women expressed the desire to give birth vaginally (52% versus 24.4%, P<0.001). In contrast, others women preferred an elective cesarean section to avoid the risk of a breech vaginal delivery. Women felt pain during the ECV and scored 60 on average using the analogical visual scale. Women rated on a verbal rating scale the ECV as severely painful to unbearable (68%), and as stressful (70%). Despite this, the majority of women would recommend ECV to their friends or would be willing to repeat it for themselves. ECV remains a scary and painful medical procedure. More research is needed to reduce the impact. The use of analgesic medication for this indication is controversial. Hypnosis could be an alternative to evaluate.

Secondary outcomes were caesarean section and measures of neonatal and maternal morbidity. The use of tocolysis for a repeat attempt at ECV significantly increases the incidence of cephalic presentation at delivery (RR 3.21; 95% CI 1.23-8.39) and reduces the incidence of caesarean section (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.14-0.80). The effects were most marked in multiparous women (RR for cephalic presentation at delivery 9.38; 95% CI 1.64-53.62). Maternal and neonatal morbidity remain unchanged. The use of tocolysis increases the success rate of repeat ECV and reduces the incidence of caesarean section.

The chance of breech presentation persisting at the time of delivery, and the risk of caesarean section, can be reduced by external cephalic version (ECV - turning the baby by manual manipulation through the mother's abdomen). It is also possible that maternal posture may influence fetal position. Many postural techniques have been used to promote cephalic version. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of postural management of breech presentation on measures of pregnancy outcome. We evaluated procedures in which the mother rests with her pelvis elevated. These include the knee-chest position, and a supine position with the pelvis elevated with a wedge-shaped cushion. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (22 August 2012). Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing postural management with pelvic elevation for breech presentation, with a control group. One or both review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality. We have included six studies involving a total of 417 women. The rates for non-cephalic births, Cesarean section and Apgar scores below 7 at one minute, regardless of whether ECV was attempted or not, were similar between the intervention and control groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.15; RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.37; RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.55). There is insufficient evidence from well-controlled trials to support the use of postural management for breech presentation. The numbers of women studied to date remain relatively small.

From January 2012 to March 2016 external cephalic versions carried out at our center, which were a total of 52. We collected data about female age, gestational age at the time of the external cephalic version, maternal body mass index (BMI), fetal variety and situation, fetal weight, parity, location of the placenta, amniotic fluid index (ILA), tocolysis, analgesia, and newborn weight at birth, minor adverse effects (dizziness, hypotension and maternal pain) and major adverse effects (tachycardia, bradycardia, decelerations and emergency cesarean section). 45% of the versions were unsuccessful and 55% were successful. The percentage of successful vaginal delivery in versions was 84% (4% were instrumental) and 15% of caesarean sections. With respect to the variables studied, only significant differences in birth weight were found; suggesting that birth weight it is related to the outcome of external cephalic version. Probably we did not find significant differences due to the number of patients studied.

We used data from a previous randomized trial among 25 hospitals and their referring midwife practices in the Netherlands. With the data of this trial, we performed a cohort study among women attempting vaginal delivery after successful ECV. We evaluated whether maternal age, gestational age, parity, time interval between ECV and delivery, birth weight, neonatal gender, and induction of labor were predictive for a vaginal delivery on one hand or a CS or instrumental vaginal delivery on the other hand. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Among 301 women who attempted vaginal delivery after a successful external cephalic version attempt, the cesarean section rate was 13% and the instrumental vaginal delivery rate 6%, resulting in a combined instrumental delivery rate of 19%. Nulliparity increased the risk of cesarean section (OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.2-6.1)) and instrumental delivery (OR 4.2 (95% CI 2.1-8.6)). Maternal age, gestational age at delivery, time interval between external cephalic version and delivery, birth weight and neonatal gender did not contribute to the prediction of failed spontaneous vaginal delivery. In our cohort of 301 women with a successful external cephalic version, nulliparity was the only one of seven factors that predicted the risk for cesarean section and instrumental vaginal delivery.\n\nPatients' and professionals' barriers and facilitators to external cephalic version for breech presentation at term, a qualitative analysis in the Netherlands\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRosman, A.

Our study aims to investigate and evaluate (1 rates of success of ECV for breech presentation at term at the Royal Womenâs Hospital in comparison to international standards; (2 mode of delivery following ECV; (3 factors influencing success rates of ECV at the Royal Womenâs Hospital. Methods. An audit of all women who underwent ECV between the years 2007 and 2014 at the Royal Womenâs Hospital as public patients was completed. Data parameters were collected from paper and electronic patient files at the Womenâs Hospital. Data was collected to analyse the effect of the following parameters on ECV success and birth outcome: age, parity, gestational age, BMI, AFI, and tocolytic use. These parameters were analysed to determine their effect on ECV outcome and birth outcome. Results. The Womenâs Hospital, Melbourne, has an ECV success rate of approximately 37%. Of the patients undergoing ECV, 29% proceeded to normal vaginal delivery. Predictors of successful ECV included low BMI, multiparity, and AFI more than 16 (P<0.05. The only predictor of cephalic vaginal delivery following ECV was multiparity. Negative predictors of cephalic delivery were low AFI and nulliparity. Conclusions.

We performed a retrospective study of women who underwent ECV after 35 weeks of gestation in 2010-2016. We assessed the birth outcomes, including umbilical cord artery pH, according to the duration of fetal bradycardia and the risk factors for bradycardia. Among 390 cases, 189 (48.5%) cases showed fetal bradycardia during or immediately after ECV. The duration of fetal bradycardia was 10âmin occurred in three cases; emergency cesarean section was performed in each case, with delivery after 12-4âmin of bradycardia. Two of three cases showed low Apgar scores at 5âmin, with an umbilical cord arterial pH of 10âmin after ECV was a risk factor for asphyxia. Thus, delivery should be completed within 10âmin after bradycardia. A low maternal BMI and a prolonged ECV procedure were risk factors for bradycardia after ECV.\n\nPatients' and professionals' barriers and facilitators to external cephalic version for breech presentation at term, a qualitative analysis in the Netherlands\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRosman, A.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remifentanil for pain relief during ECV in China. In all, 152 Chinese parturients with singleton breech presentation were randomly divided into 2 groups, each with 76 patients. All 152 patients were assigned to receive either remifentanil (infused at 0.1âÎ¼g/kg/min and demand boluses of 0.1âÎ¼g/kg) or saline placebo. The study was performed between January 2012 and December 2015. Outcome measurements included the Numerical Rating Pain Scale score (0-10) after ECV, success rate for ECV, and maternal satisfaction after ECV. Adverse events were also evaluated. The study was completed by 146 patients. Remifentanil showed greater efficacy than placebo in decreasing the pain score immediately after ECV (remifentanil 4.6âÂ±â2.6 vs placebo 6.5âÂ±â2.7; Pâ<â0.001). The success rate for ECV showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (remifentanil 56.5% vs placebo 39.5%; P = 0.04). Maternal satisfaction also showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (remifentanil 9.6âÂ±â1.4 vs placebo 6.4âÂ±â3.7; Pâ<â0.001). However, the adverse events profiles were similar between both groups. The results of this study demonstrate that remifentanil is an effective intervention for reducing pain, achieving successful ECV, and increasing maternal satisfaction during ECV, and is generally well-tolerated without additional adverse effects.\n\n[Predictors of success of external cephalic version: Bi-center study].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDochez, V; Delbos, L; Esbelin, J; Volteau, C; Winer, N; Sentilhes, L\n\n2016-05-01\n\nIn the literature, success rate of external cephalic version (ECV) is 39 to 65%. This study aims to identify potential predictors of a successful ECV. Retrospective bi-center study performed from January 2011 through December 2012 at Angers University Hospital and Nantes University Hospital from January 2011 through December 2011. Were identified the demographic and ultrasonography characteristics of patients and the data of the process. One hundred and seventy-eight patients were included, 88 in Angers and 90 in Nantes; 16.3% of ECV were successful. Multiparity (OR 28.45; P<0.01) and transverse position (OR 0.63; P<0.01) are the two significant predictors. There is no significant difference found for center, operator, position of the placenta, amniotic fluid or presence of a uterine scar. The success rate in our two French university centers is much lower than that reported in the literature. Parity and transverse position are the only 2 significant predictors of ECV success.

To determine the predictors of successful ECV as well as the success rate of ECV and the mode of, and presentation at, delivery for women undergoing ECV for breech presentation from 36-weeks gestation. A prospective review was carried out on all women who had undergone ECV from 36-weeks gestation at the Mater Mothers Hospital over an 8-year period from 2001 to 2008. Data were collected prospectively and were collated in conjunction with database review, chart review and telephonic patient interviews. A total of 355 women underwent ECV for breech presentation. The overall success rate was 66% (57% for nulliparous, 76% for multiparous). A woman who underwent ECV had a 46% chance of a vaginal birth. If the ECV was successful, she had a 70% chance of vaginal birth. From bivariate analysis, parity, amniotic fluid index (AFI) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) were determined to be possible predictors of success of ECV and were included in the logistic regression modelling. In the regression analysis, multiparity increased the odds of successful ECV by 2.18. For every one unit increase in AFI, the odds of successful ECV increased by 1.18. Multiparity and amniotic fluid volume as assessed by AFI were the significant predictors of immediate success of ECV. Conversely, lower AFI and nulliparity are factors that are likely to reduce the likelihood of successful ECV.

As a consequence, they are at high risk for caesarean section at term. The current study investigated determinants of pain perception during ECV, with special attention to maternal mental state such as depression and fear of ECV. Prospective study of 249 third-trimester pregnant women with breech position with a request for an ECV attempt. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in a large teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Prior to the ECV attempts, obstetric factors were registered, participants fulfilled the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and reported fear of ECV on a 10-point visual analog scale. Perception of pain intensity was measured with a 10-point visual analog scale, immediately after ECV. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed success of ECV to be the strongest predictor of pain perception. Furthermore, scores on the depression questionnaire and degree of fear of ECV independently explained pain perception, which was not the case for obstetrical or ECV related factors. Apart from ECV outcome, psychological factors like depression and fear of ECV were independently related to pain perception of an ECV attempt. Maternal mood state should be taken into account when offering an ECV attempt to women with a fetus in breech position. Due to the painful experience and the importance of successful outcome, ECV should only be attempted in institutions with experienced practitioners and with careful attention to maternal mood and the way a woman is coping with the ECV attempt.
