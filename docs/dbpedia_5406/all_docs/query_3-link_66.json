It has a size of 1.3 Ã 1.28 mm 2 and an operating range of Â±1 g. Silicon-on-glass (SOG) micromachining and deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE)-based process are adopted to fabricate this accelerometer with a high-aspect-ratio sensing structure. The accelerometer has an excellent z-axis output sensitivity of 1.434 V g â1 and a high resolution of 49 Âµg Hz â1/2 . The sensitivity and minimum cross-axis sensitivity of the x-axis in-plane accelerometer are 1.442 V g â1 and 0.03% and those of the y-axis accelerometer are 1.241 V g â1 and 0.21%, respectively. The new in-plane and out-of-plane accelerometer design exhibits high cross-axis sensitivity immunity, high sensitivity and high linearity suggesting that the triaxial accelerometer has the potential for use in future applications in consumer goods and the cellular phone marketÃ¾\n\nDevelopment of Dual-Axis MEMS Accelerometers for Machine Tools Vibration Monitoring\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChih-Yung Huang\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available With the development of intelligent machine tools, monitoring the vibration by the accelerometer is an important issue. Accelerometers used for measuring vibration signals during milling processes require the characteristics of high sensitivity, high resolution, and high bandwidth. A commonly used accelerometer is the lead zirconate titanate (PZT type; however, integrating it into intelligent modules is excessively expensive and difficult. Therefore, the micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS accelerometer is an alternative with the advantages of lower price and superior integration. In the present study, we integrated two MEMS accelerometer chips into a low-pass filter and housing to develop a low-cost dual-axis accelerometer with a bandwidth of 5 kHz and a full scale range of Â±50 g for measuring machine tool vibration. In addition, a platform for measuring the linearity, cross-axis sensitivity and frequency response of the MEMS accelerometer by using the back-to-back calibration method was also developed. Finally, cutting experiments with steady and chatter cutting were performed to verify the results of comparing the MEMS accelerometer with the PZT accelerometer in the time and frequency domains. The results demonstrated that the dual-axis MEMS accelerometer is suitable for monitoring the vibration of machine tools at low cost.\n\nSimulation and experimental study of a three-axis fiber Bragg grating accelerometer based on the pull-push mechanism\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJiang, Qi; Yang, Meng\n\n2013-11-01\n\nA three-axis fiber Bragg grating accelerometer, which has uniform sensitivities to three axes, has been developed for seismic application.

(paper)\n\nGround Vibration Attenuation Measurement using Triaxial and Single Axis Accelerometers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMohammad, A. H.; Yusoff, N. A.; Madun, A.; Tajudin, S. A. A.; Zahari, M. N. H.; Chik, T. N. T.; Rahman, N. A.; Annuar, Y. M. N.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPeak Particle Velocity is one of the important term to show the level of the vibration amplitude especially traveling wave by distance. Vibration measurement using triaxial accelerometer is needed to obtain accurate value of PPV however limited by the size and the available channel of the data acquisition module for detailed measurement. In this paper, an attempt to estimate accurate PPV has been made by using only a triaxial accelerometer together with multiple single axis accelerometer for the ground vibration measurement. A field test was conducted on soft ground using nine single axis accelerometers and a triaxial accelerometer installed at nine receiver location R1 to R9. Based from the obtained result, the method shows convincing similarity between actual PPV with the calculated PPV with error ratio 0.97. With the design method, vibration measurement equipment size can be reduced with fewer channel required.\n\nA novel stress isolation guard-ring design for the improvement of a three-axis piezoresistive accelerometer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHsieh, Hsieh-Shen; Chang, Heng-Chung; Hu, Chih-Fan; Cheng, Chao-Lin; Fang, Weileun\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis study designs and implements a stress isolation guard-ring structure to improve the performances of the existing single proof-mass three-axis piezoresistive accelerometer. Thus, the environment disturbances, such as temperature variation and force/deflection transmittance, for a packaged three-axis piezoresistive accelerometer are significantly reduced. In application, the three-axis piezoresistive accelerometer has been fabricated using the bulk micromachining process on the SOI wafer. Experimental results show that the out-of-plane deformation of the suspended spring mass on the packaged accelerometer is reduced from 0.72 to 0.10 Âµm at a 150 Â°C temperature elevation. The temperature coefficient of zero-g offset for the presented sensor is reduced, and the temperature-induced sensitivity variation is minimized as well. Measurements also demonstrate that the guard-ring design successfully reduces the false signals induced by the force and displacement transmittance disturbances for one order of magnitude. Moreover, the three-axis acceleration sensing for the presented accelerometer with guard ring has also been demonstrated with sensitivities of 0.12â0.17 mV V â1 g â1 and nonlinearity < 1.02%.\n\nMicrofabrication and Characterization of an Integrated 3-Axis CMOS-MEMS Accelerometer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHongwei QU\n\n2007-10-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper reports the fabrication and characterization of a monolithically integrated 3-axis CMOS-MEMS accelerometer with a single proof mass. An improved microfabrication process has been developed to solve the structure overheating and particle contamination problems in the plasma etching processes of device fabrication. The whole device is made of bulk silicon except for some short thin films for electrical isolation, allowing large sensing capacitance and flat device structure. A low-noise, low-power amplifier is designed for each axis, which provides 40 dB on-chip amplification and consumes only 1 mW power. Quasi-static and dynamic characterization of the fabricated device has been performed. The measured sensitivities of the lateral- and z-axis accelerometers are 560 mV/g and 320 mV/g, respectively, which can be tuned by simply varying the amplitude of the modulation signal. The over-all noise floors of the lateral- and z-axis are 12 Î¼g/ÃHz and 110 Î¼g/ÃHz, respectively when tested at 200 Hz.\n\nImplantable biaxial piezoresistive accelerometer for sensorimotor control.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZou, Qiang; Tan, Wei; Sok Kim, Eun; Singh, Jasspreet; Loeb, Gerald E\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the design, fabrication and test results of a novel biaxial piezoresistive accelerometer and its incorporation into a miniature neuromuscular stimulator called a BION. Because of its highly symmetric twin mass structure, the X and Z axis acceleration can be measured at the same time and the cross axis sensitivity can be minimized by proper piezoresistor design. The X and Z axis sensitivities of the biaxial accelerometer are 0.10 mV/g/V and 1.40 mV/g/V, respectively, which are further increased to 0.65 mV/g/V and 2.40 mV/g/V, respectively, with extra silicon mass added to the proof mass. The cross-axis sensitivity is less than 3.3% among X, Y and Z-axis. An orientation tracking method for human segments by measuring every joint angle is also discussed in this paper. Joint angles can be obtained by processing the outputs of a pair of biaxial accelerometers (placed very close to the joint axis on the adjacent limb links), without having to integrate acceleration or velocity signals, thereby avoiding errors due to offsets and drift.\n\nA 3-axis force balanced accelerometer using a single proof-mass\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLemkin, M.A.; Boser, B.E.; Auslander, D. [Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (United States); Smith, J. [Sandia National Lab., Albuquerque, NM (United States)\n\n1997-04-01\n\nThis paper presents a new method for wideband force balancing a proof-mass in multiple axes simultaneously. Capacitive position sense and force feedback are accomplished using the same air-gap capacitors through time multiplexing. Proof of concept is experimentally demonstrated with a single-mass monolithic surface micromachined 3-axis accelerometer.\n\nPrinciple Research on a Single Mass Piezoelectric Six-Degrees-of-Freedom Accelerometer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJingcheng Liu\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available A signal mass piezoelectric six-degrees-of-freedom (six-DOF accelerometer is put forward in response to the need for health monitoring of the dynamic vibration characteristics of high grade digitally controlled machine tools. The operating principle of the piezoelectric six-degrees-of-freedom accelerometer is analyzed, and its structure model is constructed. The numerical simulation model (finite element model of the six axis accelerometer is established. Piezoelectric quartz is chosen for the acceleration sensing element and conversion element, and its static sensitivity, static coupling interference and dynamic natural frequency, dynamic cross coupling are analyzed by ANSYS software. Research results show that the piezoelectric six-DOF accelerometer has advantages of simple and rational structure, correct sensing principle and mathematic model, good linearity, high rigidity, and theoretical natural frequency is more than 25 kHz, no nonlinear cross coupling and no complex decoupling work.\n\nA low-noise MEMS accelerometer for unattended ground sensor applications\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSpeller, Kevin E.; Yu, Duli\n\n2004-09-01\n\nA low-noise micro-machined servo accelerometer has been developed for use in Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS). Compared to conventional coil-and-magnet based velocity transducers, this Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) accelerometer offers several key benefits for battlefield monitoring. Many UGS require a compass to determine deployment orientation with respect to magnetic North. This orientation information is critical for determining the bearing of incoming signals. Conventional sensors with sensing technology based on a permanent magnet can cause interference with a compass when used in close proximity. This problem is solved with a MEMS accelerometer which does not require any magnetic materials. Frequency information below 10 Hz is valuable for identification of signal sources. Conventional seismometers used in UGS are typically limited in frequency response from 20 to 200 Hz. The MEMS accelerometer has a flat frequency response from DC to 5 kHz. The wider spectrum of signals received improves detection, classification and monitoring on the battlefield. The DC-coupled output of the MEMS accelerometer also has the added benefit of providing tilt orientation data for the deployed UGS. Other performance parameters of the MEMS accelerometer that are important to UGS such as size, weight, shock survivability, phase response, distortion, and cross-axis rejection will be discussed. Additionally, field test data from human footsteps recorded with the MEMS accelerometer will be presented.\n\nSimulation of a low frequency Z-axis SU-8 accelerometer in coventorware and MEMS+\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nCarreno, Armando Arpys Arevalo\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThis paper presents the simulation of a z-axis SU-8 capacitive accelerometer. The study consists of a modal analysis of the modeled accelerometer, a study relating capacitance to acceleration, capacitance to deflection, an effective spring constant calculation, and a comparison of results achieved using CoventorWareÂ® ANALYZERâ¢ and MEMS+Â®. A fabricated energy harvester design from [1] was used for modeling and simulation in this study, with a four spring attachment of a 650Î¼mÃ650Î¼m; Ã110Î¼m proof mass of 4.542Ã10-8 kg. At rest, the spacing between electrodes is 4Î¼m along the z-axis, and at 1.5g acceleration, there is 1.9Î¼m spacing between electrodes, at which point pull in occurs for a 1V voltage.

In this paper, an optimal design to implement to a single-axis MOEMS accelerometer consisting of a grating interferometry cavity and a micromachined sensing chip is presented. The micromachined sensing chip is composed of a proof mass along with its mechanical cantilever suspension and substrate. The dimensional parameters of the sensing chip, including the length, width, thickness and position of the cantilevers are evaluated and optimized both analytically and by finite-element-method (FEM) simulation to yield an unprecedented acceleration-displacement sensitivity. Compared with one of the most sensitive single-axis MOEMS accelerometers reported in the literature, the optimal mechanical design can yield a profound sensitivity improvement with an equal footprint area, specifically, 200% improvement in displacement-acceleration sensitivity with moderate resonant frequency and dynamic range. The modified design was microfabricated, packaged with the grating interferometry cavity and tested. The experimental results demonstrate that the MOEMS accelerometer with modified design can achieve the acceleration-displacement sensitivity of about 150Î¼m/g and acceleration sensitivity of greater than 1500V/g, which validates the effectiveness of the optimal design.\n\nFabrication and characterization of monolithic piezoresistive high-g three-axis accelerometer\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJung, Han-Il; Kwon, Dae-Sung; Kim, Jongbaeg\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe report piezoresistive high-g three-axis accelerometer with a single proof mass suspended by thin eight beams. This eight-beam design allows load-sharing at high-g preventing structural breakage, as well as the symmetric arrangement of piezoresistors. The device chip size is 1.4 mm Ã 1.4 mm Ã 0.51 mm. Experimental results show that the sensitivity in X-, Y- and Z-axes are 0.2433, 0.1308 and 0.3068 mV/g/V under 5 V applied and the resolutions are 24.2, 29.9 and 25.4 g, respectively.\n\nSuperconducting six-axis accelerometer\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPaik, H. J.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nA new superconducting accelerometer, capable of measuring both linear and angular accelerations, is under development at the University of Maryland. A single superconducting proof mass is magnetically levitated against gravity or any other proof force. Its relative positions and orientations with respect to the platform are monitored by six superconducting inductance bridges sharing a single amplifier, called the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). The six degrees of freedom, the three linear acceleration components and the three angular acceleration components, of the platform are measured simultaneously. In order to improve the linearity and the dynamic range of the instrument, the demodulated outputs of the SQUID are fed back to appropriate levitation coils so that the proof mass remains at the null position for all six inductance bridges. The expected intrinsic noise of the instrument is 4 x 10(exp -12)m s(exp -2) Hz(exp -1/2) for linear acceleration and 3 x 10(exp -11) rad s(exp -2) Hz(exp -1/2) for angular acceleration in 1-g environment. In 0-g, the linear acceleration sensitivity of the superconducting accelerometer could be improved by two orders of magnitude. The design and the operating principle of a laboratory prototype of the new instrument is discussed.\n\nMeasurement of International Roughness Index by Using Z-Axis Accelerometers and GPS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYuchuan Du\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The International Roughness Index (IRI is a well-recognized standard in the field of pavement management. Many different types of devices can be used to measure the IRI, but these devices are mainly mounted on a full-size automobile and are complicated to operate. In addition, these devices are expensive. The development of methods for IRI measurement is a prerequisite for pavement management systems and other parts of the road management industry. Based on the quarter-car model and the vehicle vibration caused by road roughness, there is a strong correlation between the in-car Z-axis acceleration and the IRI. The variation of speed of the car during the measurement process has a large influence on IRI estimation. A measurement system equipped with Z-axis accelerometers and a GPS device was developed. Using the self-designing measurement system based on the methodology proposed in this study, we performed a small-scale field test. We used a one-wheel linear model and two-wheel model to fit the variation of the Z-axis acceleration. The test results demonstrated that the low-cost measurement system has good accuracy and could enhance the efficiency of IRI measurement.\n\nMechanical impedance of the sitting human body in single-axis compared to multi-axis whole-body vibration exposure.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHolmlund, P; LundstrÃ¶m, R\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe study was aimed to investigate the mechanical impedance of the sitting human body and to compare data obtained in laboratory single-axis investigations with multi-axis data from in vehicle measurements. The experiments were performed in a laboratory for single-axis measurements. The multi-axis exposure was generated with an eight-seat minibus where the rear seats had been replaced with a rigid one. The subjects in the multi-axis experiment all participated in the single-axis experiments. There are quite a few investigations in the literature describing the human response to single-axis exposure. The response from the human body can be expected to be affected by multi-axis input in a different way than from a single-axis exposure. The present knowledge of the effect of multiple axis exposure is very limited. The measurements were performed using a specially designed force and accelerometer plate. This plate was placed between the subject and the hard seat. Outcome shows a clear difference between mechanical impedance for multi-axis exposure compared to single-axis. This is especially clear in the x-direction where the difference is very large. The conclusion is that it seems unlikely that single-axis mechanical impedance data can be directly transferred to a multi-axis environment. This is due to the force cross-talk between different directions.\n\nAn accurate calibration method for accelerometer nonlinear scale factor on a low-cost three-axis turntable\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPan, Jianye; Zhang, Chunxi; Cai, Qingzhong\n\n2014-01-01\n\nStrapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) requirements are very demanding on gyroscopes and accelerometers as well as on calibration. To improve the accuracy of SINS, high-accuracy calibration is needed. Adding the accelerometer nonlinear scale factor into the model and reducing estimation errors is essential for improving calibration methods. In this paper, the inertial navigation error model is simplified, including only velocity and tilt errors. Based on the simplified error model, the relationship between the navigation errors (the rates of change of velocity errors) and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) calibration parameters is presented. A tracking model is designed to estimate the rates of change of velocity errors. With a special calibration procedure consisting of six rotation sequences, the accelerometer nonlinear scale factor errors can be computed by the estimates of the rates of change of velocity errors. Simulation and laboratory test results show that the accelerometer nonlinear scale factor can be calibrated with satisfactory accuracy on a low-cost three-axis turntable in several minutes. The comparison with the traditional calibration method highlights the superior performance of the proposed calibration method without precise orientation control. In addition, the proposed calibration method saves a lot of time in comparison with the multi-position calibration method.

To analyze tremor, we hypothesized that the influence of gravitational acceleration should be separated from that of movement. This hypothesis was tested experimentally and we also attempted to record and analyze tremor using our system in a clinical ward. A system for tremor measurement and analysis was developed using the three-axis accelerometer built into the Wii Remote. The frequency and amplitude of mechanical oscillation were calculated using methods for frequency analysis of the axis of largest variance and an estimation of tremor amplitude. The system consists of a program for measurement and analysis of Wii Remote acceleration (Tremor Analyzer), a Wii Remote, a Bluetooth USB adapter and a Web camera. The Tremor Analyzer has a GUI (graphical user interface) that is divided into five seg- ments. The sampling period of the analyzer is 30 msec. To confirm the hypothesis, mechanical oscillations were fed to the Wii Remote. The peak frequency of the power spectrum and the frequency of the oscillation generator were in good agreement, except at 1 Hz (0.01 G) and 2 Hz (0.02 G). With a change in the sum of squares of the three axes from 1.0 to 1.8 (G), the estimated and generated amplitude (0.3 cm) were in close agreement. This system using a Wii Remote is capable of analyzing frequency and estimated amplitude of tremor between 3 Hz and 15 Hz.\n\nCompressed sensing method for human activity recognition using tri-axis accelerometer on mobile phone\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\nSong Hui; Wang Zhongmin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe diversity in the phone placements of different mobile users' dailylife increases the difficulty of recognizing human activities by using mobile phone accelerometer data.To solve this problem,a compressed sensing method to recognize human activities that is based on compressed sensing theory and utilizes both raw mobile phone accelerometer data and phone placement information is proposed.First,an over-complete dictionary matrix is constructed using sufficient raw tri-axis acceleration data labeled with phone placement information.Then,the sparse coefficient is evaluated for the samples that need to be tested by resolving L1 minimization.Finally,residual values are calculated and the minimum value is selected as the indicator to obtain the recognition results.Experimental results show that this method can achieve a recognition accuracy reaching 89.86ï¼ ,which is higher than that of a recognition method that does not adopt the phone placement information for the recognition process.The recognition accuracy of the proposed method is effective and satisfactory.\n\nPerformance enhancement of a silicon MEMS piezoresistive single axis accelerometer with electroplated gold on a proof mass\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRavi Sankar, A; Lahiri, S K; Das, S\n\n2009-01-01\n\nPerformance enhancement of a silicon MEMS piezoresistive single axis accelerometer with electroplated gold on a proof mass is presented in this paper. The fabricated accelerometer device consists of a heavy proof mass supported by four thin flexures. Boron-diffused piezoresistors located near the fixed ends of the flexures are used for sensing the developed stress and hence acceleration. Performance enhancement is achieved by electroplating a gold mass of 20 Âµm thickness on top of the proof mass. A commercially available sulfite-based solution TSG-250(TM) was used for the electroplating process. Aluminum metal lines were used to form a Wheatstone bridge for signal pick-up. To avoid galvanic corrosion between two dissimilar metals having contact in an electrolyte, a shadow mask technique was used to selectively deposit a Cr/Au seed layer on an insulator atop the proof mass for subsequent electrodeposition. Bulk micromachining was performed using a 5% dual-doped TMAH solution. Fabricated devices with different electroplated gold areas were tested up to Â±13 g acceleration. For electroplated gold dimensions of 2500 Âµm Ã 2500 Âµm Ã 20 Âµm on a proof mass, sensitivity along the Z-axis is increased by 21.8% as compared to the structure without gold. Off-axis sensitivities along the X- and Y-axes are reduced by 7.6% and 6.9%, respectively\n\nA Subnano-g Electrostatic Force-Rebalanced Flexure Accelerometer for Gravity Gradient Instruments\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nShitao Yan\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available A subnano-g electrostatic force-rebalanced flexure accelerometer is designed for the rotating accelerometer gravity gradient instrument. This accelerometer has a large proof mass, which is supported inversely by two pairs of parallel leaf springs and is centered between two fixed capacitor plates. This novel design enables the proof mass to move exactly along the sensitive direction and exhibits a high rejection ratio at its cross-axis directions. Benefiting from large proof mass, high vacuum packaging, and air-tight sealing, the thermal Brownian noise of the accelerometer is lowered down to less than 0.2 ng / Hz with a quality factor of 15 and a natural resonant frequency of about 7.4 Hz . The accelerometerâs designed measurement range is about Â±1 mg. Based on the correlation analysis between a commercial triaxial seismometer and our accelerometer, the demonstrated self-noise of our accelerometers is reduced to lower than 0.3 ng / Hz over the frequency ranging from 0.2 to 2 Hz, which meets the requirement of the rotating accelerometer gravity gradiometer.\n\nAccelerometer vs. geophone response : a field case history\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHons, M.S.; Stewart, R.R.; Lawton, D.C.; Bertram, M.B. [Calgary Univ., AB (Canada); Hauer, G. [ARAM Systems Ltd, Calgary, AB (Canada)\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThe geophysical community has shown interest in the use of MEMS accelerometers as a new sensor for acquiring seismic data. Accelerometers, with their flat response in acceleration, may have advantages over geophones at low frequencies as well as high frequencies due to greater sensitivity. In this study, geophones and accelerometers were considered as simple harmonic oscillators. A method was developed to calculate ground acceleration from geophone data using a frequency-domain inverse filter and an empirical scaling constant. A comparison of acceleration-domain spectra from geophones and MEMS accelerometers from an oilfield survey at Violet Grove, Alberta, Canada revealed a distinct similarity between the geophone and accelerometer data, over a band of 5-200 Hz. The accelerometer amplitudes were larger than the geophones below 5 Hz and there were some differences at very high frequencies. Significant events related to the first breaks were not observed on the accelerometer records at some stations. It was concluded that both types of sensors can record ground motion similarly. If data from the two sensor types must be merged, a scaling factor based on matching amplitude spectra should be found. The spectra should be similar once the appropriate scaling is found, particularly around the dominant frequency. Some of the differences in data were related to high frequencies, very low frequencies, and near the first breaks. 4 refs., 6 figs.\n\nIntelligent tires for identifying coefficient of friction of tire/road contact surfaces using three-axis accelerometer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMatsuzaki, Ryosuke; Kamai, Kazuto; Seki, Ryosuke\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntelligent tires equipped with sensors as well as the monitoring of the tire/road contact conditions are in demand for improving vehicle control and safety. With the aim of identifying the coefficient of friction of tire/road contact surfaces during driving, including during cornering, we develop an identification scheme for the coefficient of friction that involves estimation of the slip angle and applied force by using a single lightweight three-axis accelerometer attached on the inner surface of the tire. To validate the developed scheme, we conduct tire-rolling tests using an accelerometer-equipped tire with various slip angles on various types of road surfaces, including dry and wet surfaces. The results of these tests confirm that the estimated slip angle and applied force are reasonable. Furthermore, the identified coefficient of friction by the developed scheme agreed with that measured by standardized tests.

Higher order nonlinear terms have been taken into account for studying the pull in voltage analysis. A nonlinear model of gas film squeezing damping, another source of nonlinearity in MEMS devices is included in obtaining the dynamic responses. Moreover, in the present work, the possible source of nonlinearities while formulating the mathematical model of a MEMS accelerometer and their influences on the dynamic responses have been investigated. The theoretical results obtained by using MATLAB has been verified with the results obtained in FE software and has been found in good agreement. Criterion towards stable micro size accelerometer for each configuration has been investigated.

Walking speed was calculated and used as a reference measure. Through ROC analysis, accelerometer cut points for different levels of walking speed in counts per 15 seconds were generated, and a leave-one-out cross-validation was performed followed by a quadratic weighted Cohen's Kappa, to test the level of agreement between true and cut point-predicted walking speeds.Optimal cut points for walking speeds â¤ 1.0 m/s were â¤ 328 and â¤ 470 counts/15 sec; for speeds > 1.3 m/s, they were â¥ 730 and â¥ 851 counts/15 sec for the vertical axis and vector magnitude, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 61%-100% for the developed cut points. The quadratic weighted Kappa showed substantial agreement: Îº = 0.79 (95% CI 0.70-0.89 and Îº = 0.69 (95% CI 0.56-0.82 for the vertical axis and the vector magnitude, respectively.This study provides accelerometer cut points based on walking speed for physical-activity measurement in older adults with Parkinson's disease for evaluation of interventions and for investigating links between physical activity and health.\n\nThree Three-Axis IEPE Accelerometers on the Inner Liner of a Tire for Finding the Tire-Road Friction Potential Indicators.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNiskanen, Arto; Tuononen, Ari J\n\n2015-08-05\n\nDirect tire-road contact friction estimation is essential for future autonomous cars and active safety systems. Friction estimation methods have been proposed earlier for driving conditions in the presence of a slip angle or slip ratio. However, the estimation of the friction from a freely-rolling tire is still an unsolved topic. Knowing the existing friction potential would be beneficial since vehicle control systems could be adjusted before any remarkable tire force has been produced. Since accelerometers are well-known and robust, and thus a promising sensor type for intelligent tires, this study uses three three-axis IEPE accelerometers on the inner liner of a tire to detect friction potential indicators on two equally smooth surfaces with different friction levels. The equal roughness was chosen for both surfaces in order to study the friction phenomena by neglecting the effect of surface texture on vibrations. The acceleration data before the contact is used to differentiate the two friction levels between the tire and the road. In addition, the contact lengths from the three accelerometers are used to validate the acceleration data. A method to differentiate the friction levels on the basis of the acceleration signal is also introduced.\n\nThree Three-Axis IEPE Accelerometers on the Inner Liner of a Tire for Finding the Tire-Road Friction Potential Indicators\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArto Niskanen\n\n2015-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Direct tire-road contact friction estimation is essential for future autonomous cars and active safety systems.

The sensor has been designed to be integrated in an advanced seismic isolation system for interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The motion of a small monolithic folded-pendulum (FP) is monitored by a high resolution capacitance displacement sensor; a feedback force actuator keeps the mass at the equilibrium position. The feedback signal is proportional to the ground acceleration in the frequency range 0-150Hz. The very high mechanical quality factor, Q{approx}3000 at a resonant frequency of 0.5Hz, reduces the Brownian motion of the proof mass of the accelerometer below the resolution of the displacement sensor. This scheme enables the accelerometer to detect the inertial displacement of a platform with a root-mean-square noise less than 1nm, integrated over the frequency band from 0.01 to 150Hz. The FP geometry, combined with the monolithic design, allows the accelerometer to be extremely directional. A vertical-horizontal coupling ranging better than 10{sup -3} has been achieved. A detailed account of the design and construction of the accelerometer is reported here. The instrument is fully ultra-high vacuum compatible and has been tested and approved for integration in seismic attenuation system of japanese TAMA 300 gravitational wave detector. The monolithic design also makes the accelerometer suitable for cryogenic operation.\n\nSelf Diagnostic Accelerometer Testing on the C-17 Aircraft\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTokars, Roger P.; Lekki, John D.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe self diagnostic accelerometer (SDA) developed by the NASA Glenn Research Center was tested for the first time in an aircraft engine environment as part of the Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (VIPR) program. The VIPR program includes testing multiple critical flight sensor technologies. One such sensor, the accelerometer, measures vibrations to detect faults in the engine. In order to rely upon the accelerometer, the health of the accelerometer must be ensured. The SDA is a sensor system designed to actively determine the accelerometer structural health and attachment condition, in addition to vibration measurements. The SDA uses a signal conditioning unit that sends an electrical chirp to the accelerometer and recognizes changes in the response due to changes in the accelerometer health and attachment condition. To demonstrate the SDAs flight worthiness and robustness, multiple SDAs were mounted and tested on a C-17 aircraft engine. The engine test conditions varied from engine off, to idle, to maximum power. The SDA attachment conditions were varied from fully tight to loose. The newly developed SDA health algorithm described herein uses cross correlation pattern recognition to discriminate a healthy from a faulty SDA. The VIPR test results demonstrate for the first.\n\nIdentification of Capacitive MEMS Accelerometer Structure Parameters for Human Body Dynamics Measurements\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVincas Benevicius\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Due to their small size, low weight, low cost and low energy consumption, MEMS accelerometers have achieved great commercial success in recent decades. The aim of this research work is to identify a MEMS accelerometer structure for human body dynamics measurements. Photogrammetry was used in order to measure possible maximum accelerations of human body parts and the bandwidth of the digital acceleration signal. As the primary structure the capacitive accelerometer configuration is chosen in such a way that sensing part measures on all three axes as it is 3D accelerometer and sensitivity on each axis is equal. Hill climbing optimization was used to find the structure parameters. Proof-mass displacements were simulated for all the acceleration range that was given by the optimization problem constraints. The final model was constructed in Comsol Multiphysics. Eigenfrequencies were calculated and modelâs response was found, when vibration stand displacement data was fed into the model as the base excitation law. Model output comparison with experimental data was conducted for all excitation frequencies used during the experiments.\n\nDesign and measurement of a piezoresistive triaxial accelerometer based on MEMS technology\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDu Chunhui; He Changde; Yu Jiaqi; Ge Xiaoyang; Zhang Wendong; Zhang Yongping\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWith the springing up of the MEMS industry, research on accelerometers is focused on miniaturization, integration, high reliability, and high resolution, and shares extensive application prospects in military and civil fields. Comparing with the traditional single cantilever beam structure or 'cantilever-mass' structure, the proposed structure of '8-beams/mass' with its varistor completely symmetric distribution in micro-silicon piezoresistive triaxial accelerometer in this paper has a higher axial sensitivity and smaller cross-axis sensitivity. Adopting ANSYS, the process of structural analysis and the manufacturing flow of sensing unit are showed. In dynamic testing conditions, it can be concluded that the axial sensitivity of x, y, and z are S x = 48 Î¼V/g, S y = 54 Î¼V/g and S z = 217 Î¼V/g respectively, and the nonlinearities are 0.4%, 0.6% and 0.4%.\n\nThermospheric neutral densities derived from Swarm accelerometer and GPS data\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nDoornbos, Eelco; Encarnacao, Joao; van den IJss, Jose\n\nOver the past years, a lot of effort has been put into characterising and correcting the various disturbance signals that were found in the accelerometer data provided by the Swarm satellites. This effort was first and foremost aimed at the Swarm C along-track axis data, which seems to be the least...... affected and most promising data for scientific use. The goal to make the Swarm C accelerometer along-track axis data ready for further processing into level 2 thermosphere density data has now been accomplished, with the help of information on the satellite motion from the GPS tracking as well...... approach, affects the possibility of determining densities from the accelerometer measurements of the Swarm A and B satellites. We also investigate the possibility of determining crosswind speeds from Swarm data.In the meantime, we have investigated the possibility of deriving thermosphere neutral density...\n\nAttitude determination with three-axis accelerometer for emergency atmospheric entry\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGarcia-Llama, Eduardo (Inventor)\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTwo algorithms are disclosed that, with the use of a 3-axis accelerometer, will be able to determine the angles of attack, sideslip and roll of a capsule-type spacecraft prior to entry (at very high altitudes, where the atmospheric density is still very low) and during entry. The invention relates to emergency situations in which no reliable attitude and attitude rate are available. Provided that the spacecraft would not attempt a guided entry without reliable attitude information, the objective of the entry system in such case would be to attempt a safe ballistic entry. A ballistic entry requires three controlled phases to be executed in sequence: First, cancel initial rates in case the spacecraft is tumbling; second, maneuver the capsule to a heat-shield-forward attitude, preferably to the trim attitude, to counteract the heat rate and heat load build up; and third, impart a ballistic bank or roll rate to null the average lift vector in order to prevent prolonged lift down situations. Being able to know the attitude, hence the attitude rate, will allow the control system (nominal or backup, automatic or manual) to cancel any initial angular rates. Also, since a heat-shield forward attitude and the trim attitude can be specified in terms of the angles of attack and sideslip, being able to determine the current attitude in terms of these angles will allow the control system to maneuver the vehicle to the desired attitude. Finally, being able to determine the roll angle will allow for the control of the roll ballistic rate during entry.\n\nImpact of inability to turn in bed assessed by a wearable three-axis accelerometer on patients with Parkinson's disease.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nUchino, Kenji; Shiraishi, Makoto; Tanaka, Keita; Akamatsu, Masashi; Hasegawa, Yasuhiro\n\n2017-01-01\n\nDifficulty turning over in bed is a common night-time symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to quantitatively evaluate overnight turnover movements using a three-axis accelerometer and to investigate whether inability to turn in bed is related to daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, and depressive mood in PD patients. We examined 64 patients with PD (mean age, 73.3Â±8.21 years; modified Hoehn-Yahr [mH-Y] stage, 3.0Â±1.0; disease duration, 7.2Â±6.3 years; unified Parkinson's disease rating scale [UPDRS], 36.9Â±18.3). Overnight monitoring of turnover movements using a wearable three-axis accelerometer was performed in all patients. Nocturnal kinetic parameters including total time recumbent, total time supine, number of turnover movements, and mean interval between turnover movements were obtained. Daytime immobility was assessed using the Barthel index (B-I), UPDRS, and mH-Y stage. Patients were also assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Number of turnover movements in bed correlated negatively with disease duration (r = -0.305; pbed was generally inconsistent with awareness of turnover movement impairment as evaluated by PDSS-2 Item 9 scores, but patients who were never aware of impaired turnover movements showed â¥5 turnover movements overnight. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed no correlations between number of nocturnal turnover movements in bed and BDI, ESS, or PDSS-2. Use of anti-psychotic drugs was associated with ESS (p = 0.045). UPDRS was associated with PDSS-2 (p = 0.016). Decreased number of turnover movements may not be a direct determinant of daytime sleepiness, sleep disorders, or depressive mood in PD patients. Use of anti-psychotic drugs and higher UPDRS score are factors significantly associated with daytime sleepiness and uncomfortable sleep, respectively.\n\nThe dual cycle bridge detection of piezoresistive triaxial accelerometer based on MEMS technology\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhang Juanting; He Changde; Zhang Hui; Li Yuping; Du Chunhui; Zhang Wendong; Zhang Yongping\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA cycle bridge detection method, which uses a piezoresistive triaxial accelerometer, has been described innovatively. This method just uses eight resistors to form a cycle detection bridge, which can detect the signal of the three directions for real time. It breaks the law of the ordinary independent Wheatstone bridge detection method, which uses at least 12 resistors and each four resistors connected as a Wheatstone bridge to detect the output signal from a specific direction. In order to verify the feasibility of this method, the modeling and simulating of the sensor structure have been conducted by ANSYS, then the dual cycle bridge detection method and independent Wheatstone bridge detection method are compared, the result shows that the former method can improve the sensitivity of the sensor effectively. The sensitivity of the x, y-axis used in the former method is two times that of the sensor used in the latter method, and the sensitivity of the z-axis is four times. At the same time, it can also reduce the cross-axis coupling degree of the sensor used in the dual cycle bridge detection method. In addition, a signal amplifier circuit and adder circuit have been provided. Finally, the test result of the âeight-beams/massâ triaxial accelerometer, which is based on the dual cycle bridge detection method and the related circuits, have been provided. The results of the test and the theoretical analysis are consistent, on the whole.

H.; Fazlizan, A.; Wang, C. T.; Poh, S. C.\n\n2016-06-01\n\nA novel cross axis wind turbine (CAWT) which comprises of a cross axis blades arrangement was presented and investigated experimentally. The CAWT is a new type of wind turbine that extracts wind energy from airflow coming from the horizontal and vertical directions. The wind turbine consists of three vertical blades and six horizontal blades arranged in a cross axis orientation. Hubs in the middle of the CAWT link the horizontal and vertical blades through connectors to form the CAWT. The study used a 45Â° deflector to guide the oncoming airflow upward (vertical wind direction). The results from the study showed that the CAWT produced significant improvements in power output and rotational speed performance compared to a conventional straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT).\n\nGarment-based detection of falls and activities of daily living using 3-axis MEMS accelerometer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNyan, M N; Tay, Francis E H; Manimaran, M; Seah, K H W\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis paper studied the detection of falls and activities of daily living (ADL) with two objectives: (1) minimum number of sensors for a broad range of activities and (2) maximize the comfort of the wearer for long term use. We used a garment to provide long term comfort for the wearer, with a 3-axis MEMS accelerometer on the shoulder position, as a wearable platform. ADL were detected in time-frequency domain and summation of absolute peak values of 3-D acceleration signals was used as feature in fall detection. 6 male and female subjects performed approximately five-hour long experiment. Sensitivity of 94.98% and specificity of 98.83% for altogether 1495 activities were achieved. Our garment-based detection system fulfilled the objective of providing the comfort of the wearer in long term monitoring of falls and ADL with high sensitivity. In fall detection, our device can summon medical assistances via SMS (Short Message Service). This detection system can raise fall alarm (fall SMS) automatically to individuals to get a shortened interval of the arrival of assistance\n\nA biomimetic accelerometer inspired by the cricket's clavate hair\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nDroogendijk, H.; de Boer, Meint J.; Sanders, Remco G.P.; Krijnen, Gijsbertus J.M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCrickets use so-called clavate hairs to sense (gravitational) acceleration to obtain information on their orientation.

The VIPR program includes testing multiple critical flight sensor technologies. One such sensor, the accelerometer, measures vibrations to detect faults in the engine. In order to rely upon the accelerometer, the health of the accelerometer must be ensured. Sensor system malfunction is a significant contributor to propulsion in flight shutdowns (IFSD) which can lead to aircraft accidents when the issue is compounded with an inappropriate crew response. The development of the SDA is important for both reducing the IFSD rate, and hence reducing the rate at which this component failure type can put an aircraft in jeopardy, and also as a critical enabling technology for future automated malfunction diagnostic systems. The SDA is a sensor system designed to actively determine the accelerometer structural health and attachment condition, in addition to making vibration measurements. The SDA uses a signal conditioning unit that sends an electrical chirp to the accelerometer and recognizes changes in the response due to changes in the accelerometer health and attachment condition. In an effort toward demonstrating the SDAs flight worthiness and robustness, multiple SDAs were mounted and tested on a C-17 aircraft engine. The engine test conditions varied from engine off, to idle, to maximum power. The two SDA attachment conditions used were fully tight and loose. The newly developed SDA health algorithm described herein uses cross correlation pattern recognition to discriminate a healthy from a faulty SDA. The VIPR test results demonstrate for the first time the robustness of the SDA in an engine environment characterized by high vibration levels.\n\nExperimental Study of the Information Signal of Combined Shock, Tilt, and Motion Sensor Based on the 3-Axis MEMS-Accelerometer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nS. A. Vasyukov\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Modern car alarm systems are equipped with smart sensors implemented using various physical principles. These sensors have to ensure high reliability and validity of monitored parameters with a lack of false operations. First of all, shock sensor, which is a part of, essentially, entire alarm systems, as well as tilt and motion sensors are referred to the smart sensors.Shock sensors with the sensitive elements (SE of piezoelectric, microphone, and electromagnetic types possess a number of the essential shortcomings caused by the type of SE. It is, first of all, a narrow band of the sensitive elements, which does not allow true differentiation of shocks to the autobody from false actions, as well as a various sensitivity of sensors depending on the SE axis orientation.Tilt sensors of electromagnetic type implemented as separate devices were seldom used because of their high cost and imperfect characteristics. Though there is still a need for such sensors. The specified shortcomings can be hardly overcome through improvement of sensitive element hangers of considered sensors. The use of the three-axial accelerometers made by MEMS technology seems to be the most perspective here.The article presents results of pilot studies of the accelerations reached when auto-body is under shock and a car is inclined and runs. When measuring, the test board STM32F3DISCOVERY with the MEMS accelerometer LSM303DLHS is used. A level of noise and vibrations has been analysed when mounting a board on the plastic panel of the car and when operating the engine in the range from 700 to 4000 rpm. The article presents accelerations implemented under the following conditions: light shocks in different parts of the auto-body (wing, trunk, hood; strong shock (closing a door; slow and fast acceleration to the speed of 20 km/h with the subsequent braking and passage of obstacles such as \"sleeping policemen\".Research results enabled us to make justification for selecting the\n\nAccelerometer for Space Applications Based on Light-Pulse Atom Interferometry, Phase II\n\nData.gov (United States)\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration â We propose to build a compact, high-precision single-axis accelerometer based on atom interferometry that is applicable to operation in space environments.

Higher physical activity (PA) has been associated with lower cardiovascular reactivity in adults, but little data is available in children. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between PA and cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress in children. Cross-sectional study. This study sample included children from the Oswego Lead Study (n=79, 46% female, 9-11 years old). Impedance cardiography was performed while children participated in a stress response protocol. Children were also asked to wear Actigraph accelerometers on their wrists for 3 days to measure intensity and duration of PA and sedentary time. In multivariable models, moderate to vigorous (MV) PA was associated with lower body mass index (BMI) percentile and lower total peripheral resistance (TPR) response to stress (beta=-0.025, p=0.02; beta=-0.009, p=0.05). After additional adjustment for BMI, MVPA was also associated with lower diastolic blood pressure response to stress (beta=-0.01, p=0.03). Total PA and sedentary time were not associated with BMI or cardiovascular responses to stress. A modest, inverse relation of PA to vascular reactivity to mental stress was observed in children. These data provide confirmatory evidence that the promotion of PA recommendations for children are important for cardiovascular health. Copyright Â© 2016 Sports Medicine Australia.

Tri-axial accelerometers are capable of collecting vast amounts of data for locomotion and posture observations; however, interpretation and optimization of these data records remain a challenge. The aim of the present study was to introduce an optimized method for gait (walking, trotting and galloping) and posture (standing and lying) discrimination, using the acceleration values recorded by a tri-axial accelerometer mounted on the hind leg of sheep. The acceleration values recorded on the vertical and horizontal axes, as well as the total acceleration values were categorized. The relative frequencies of the acceleration categories (RFACs) were calculated in 3-s epochs. Reliable RFACs for gait and posture discrimination were identified with discriminant function and canonical analyses. Post hoc predictions for the two axes and total acceleration were conducted, using classification functions and classification scores for each epoch. Mahalanobis distances were used to determine the level of accuracy of the method. The highest discriminatory power for gait discrimination yielded four RFACs on the vertical axis, and five RFACs each on the horizontal axis and total acceleration vector. Classification functions showed the highest accuracy for walking and galloping. The highest total accuracy on the vertical and horizontal axes were 90% and 91%, respectively. Regarding posture discrimination, the vertical axis exhibited the highest discriminatory power, with values of RFAC (0, 1]=99.95% for standing; and RFAC (-1, 0]=99.50% for lying. The horizontal axis showed strong discrimination for the lying side of the animal, as values were in the acceleration category of (0, 1] for lying on the left side and (-1, 0] on the right side.

It has been theoretically and experimentally studied with different detector widths, pressure and gas nature. Although this type of sensor has already been intensively examined, little information concerning the frequency response modeling is currently available and very few experimental results about the frequency response are reported in the literature. In some particular conditions, our measurements show a cut-off frequency at â3 dB greater than 200 Hz. By using simple cylindrical and planar models of the thermal accelerometer and an equivalent electrical circuit, a good agreement with the experimental results has been demonstrated.\n\nPhysical Activity and Adiposity Markers at Older Ages: Accelerometer Vs Questionnaire Data\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSabia, SÃ©verine; Cogranne, Pol; van Hees, Vincent T.; Bell, Joshua A.; Elbaz, Alexis; Kivimaki, Mika; Singh-Manoux, Archana\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective Physical activity is critically important for successful aging, but its effect on adiposity markers at older ages is unclear as much of the evidence comes from self-reported data on physical activity. We assessed the associations of questionnaire-assessed and accelerometer-assessed physical activity with adiposity markers in older adults. Design/Setting/Participants This was a cross-sectional study on 3940 participants (age range 60-83Â years) of the Whitehall II study who completed a 20-item physical activity questionnaire and wore a wrist-mounted accelerometer for 9Â days in 2012 andÂ 2013. Measurements Total physical activity was estimated using metabolic equivalent hours/week for the questionnaire and mean acceleration for the accelerometer. Time spent in moderate-and-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was also assessed by questionnaire and accelerometer. Adiposity assessment included body mass index, waist circumference, and fat mass index. Fat mass index was calculated as fat mass/heightÂ² (kg/mÂ²), with fat mass estimated using bioimpedance. Results Greater total physical activity was associated with lower adiposity for all adiposity markers in a dose-response manner. In men, the strength of this association was 2.4 to 2.8 times stronger with the accelerometer than with questionnaire data. In women, it was 1.9 to 2.3 times stronger. For MVPA, questionnaire data in men suggested no further benefit for adiposity markers past 1Â hour/week of activity. This was not the case for accelerometer-assessed MVPA where, for example, compared with men undertaking physical activity with adiposity markers in older adults was stronger when physical activity was assessed by accelerometer compared with questionnaire, suggesting that physical activity might be more important for adiposity than previously estimated.

This paper introduces a Kalman filter for the estimation of a sensor acceleration based on a six-axis inertial sensor (i.e., a three-axis accelerometer and three-axis gyroscope). The novelty of the proposed Kalman filter lies in the fact that its state vector includes not only the tilt angle variable but also the sensor acceleration. Thus, the filter can explicitly estimate the latter with a high accuracy. The accuracy of acceleration estimates were validated experimentally under three different dynamic conditions, using an optical motion capture system. It could be concluded that the performance of the proposed Kalman filter was comparable to that of the state-of-the-art estimation algorithm employed by the Xsens MTw. The proposed algorithm may be more suitable than inertial/magnetic sensor-based algorithms for various applications adopting six-axis inertial sensors\n\nAccelerometer-measured dose-response for physical activity, sedentary time, and mortality in US adults\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMatthews, Charles E; Keadle, S.

Objectives: Using accelerometer-based measures, we 1) described the mortality dose-response...... for sedentary time and light-and moderateto-vigorous-intensity activity using restricted cubic splines, and 2) estimated the mortality benefits associated with replacing sedentary time with physical activity, accounting for total activity. Design: US adults (n = 4840) from NHANES (2003-2006) wore...... an accelerometer for #7 d and were followed prospectively for mortality. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for mortality associations with time spent sedentary and in light-and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity.

David; DuToit, Cornelis\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe goal of this work was to improve off-axis cross-polarization performance and ease of assembly of a circularly polarized microwave antenna element. To ease assembly, the initial design requirement of Hexweb support for the internal circuit part, as well as the radiating disks, was eliminated. There is a need for different plating techniques to improve soldering. It was also desirable to change the design to eliminate soldering as well as the need to use the Hexweb support. Thus, a technique was developed to build the feed without using solder, solving the lathing and soldering issue. Internal parts were strengthened by adding curvature to eliminate Hexweb support, and in the process, the new geometries of the internal parts opened the way for improving the off-axis cross-polarization performance as well. The radiating disks curvatures were increased for increased strength, but it was found that this also improved crosspolarization. Optimization of the curvatures leads to very low off-axis cross-polarization. The feed circuit was curved into a cylinder for improved strength, eliminating Hexweb support. An aperture coupling feed mechanism eliminated the need for feed pins to the disks, which would have required soldering. The aperture coupling technique also improves cross-polarization performance by effectively exciting the radiating disks very close to the antenna s central axis of symmetry. Because of the shape of the parts, it allowed for an all-aluminum design bolted together and assembled with no solder needed. The advantage of a solderless design is that the reliability is higher, with no single-point failure (solder), and no need for special plating techniques in order to solder the unit together. The shapes (curved or round) make for a more robust build without extra support materials, as well as improved offaxis cross-polarization.\n\nMechanical Structural Design of a MEMS-Based Piezoresistive Accelerometer for Head Injuries Monitoring: A Computational Analysis by Increments of the Sensor Mass Moment of Inertia â\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMessina, Marco; Njuguna, James; Palas, Chrysovalantis\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis work focuses on the proof-mass mechanical structural design improvement of a tri-axial piezoresistive accelerometer specifically designed for head injuries monitoring where medium-G impacts are common; for example, in sports such as racing cars or American Football. The device requires the highest sensitivity achievable with a single proof-mass approach, and a very low error (piezoresistors are located (i.e., x- and y-axis) by increasing the MMI in the x- and y-axis, will undoubtedly increase the longitudinal stresses applied in that areas for a given external acceleration, therefore increasing the piezoresistors fractional resistance change and eventually positively affecting the sensor sensitivity. The final device shows a sensitivity increase of about 80% in the z-axis and a reduction of cross-axis sensitivity of 18% respect to state-of-art sensors available in the literature from a previous work of the authors. Sensor design, modelling, and optimization are presented, concluding the work with results, discussion, and conclusion.

It also can cause other hazards such as tsunami, landslide, etc. In that case it requires a system that can examine the earthquake occurrence. Some possible system to detect earthquake is by creating a vibration sensor system using accelerometer. However, the output of the system is usually put in the form of acceleration data. Therefore, a calibrator system for accelerometer to sense the vibration is needed. In this study, a simple accelerometer calibrator has been developed using 12 V DC motor, optocoupler, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and AVR 328 microcontroller as controller system. The system uses the Pulse Wave Modulation (PWM) form microcontroller to control the motor rotational speed as response to vibration frequency. The frequency of vibration was read by optocoupler and then those data was used as feedback to the system. The results show that the systems could control the rotational speed and the vibration frequencies in accordance with the defined PWM.

To determine if catch-up responses are elicited by unexpected rotational perturbations and are strength-, axis-, and/or direction-dependent, we imposed step torque loads about each of two axes which were defined relative to the subject's hand: the distal-proximal axis away from and towards the subject's palm, and the grip axis which connects the two fingertips. Precision grip responses were dominated initially by passive mechanics and then by active, unimodal catch-up responses. First dorsal interosseous activity, marking the start of the catch-up response, began 71-89 ms after the onset of perturbation. The onset latency, shape, and duration (217-231 ms) of the catch-up response were not affected by the axis, direction, or magnitude of the rotational perturbation, while strength was scaled by axis of rotation and slip conditions. Rotations about the grip axis that tilted the object away from the palm and induced rotational slip elicited stronger catch-up responses than rotations about the distal-proximal axis that twisted the object between the digits. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate grip responses to unexpected torque loads and to show characteristic, yet axis-dependent, catch-up responses for conditions other than pure linear slip.

Accelerometers working in operational situations are stimulated by composite inputs, including constant acceleration and vibration, from multiple directions. However, traditional methods for evaluating rectification error only use one-dimensional vibration. In this paper, a double turntable centrifuge (DTC) was utilized to produce the constant acceleration and vibration simultaneously and we tested the rectification error due to the composite accelerations. At first, we deduced the expression of the rectification error with the output of the DTC and a static model of the single-axis pendulous accelerometer under test. Theoretical investigation and analysis were carried out in accordance with the rectification error model. Then a detailed experimental procedure and testing results were described. We measured the rectification error with various constant accelerations at different frequencies and amplitudes of the vibration. The experimental results showed the distinguished characteristics of the rectification error caused by the composite accelerations. The linear relation between the constant acceleration and the rectification error was proved. The experimental procedure and results presented in this context can be referenced for the investigation of the characteristics of accelerometer with multiple inputs.\n\nA state-the-art report on the development of the piezoelectric accelerometer sensor\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPark, Jee Yun; Oh, Suk Jin; Kim, Kyung Hoh; Kim, Sun Jae; Kang, Dae Kab [Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Taejon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n1994-12-01\n\nA state-of-the art surveys on the application and the manufacturing technology of a piezoelectric accelerometer sensor.

Both methods show a distorted contact area in wet conditions, but interesting differences appeared. First, the contact area in full aquaplaning seems strongly distorted on a glass plate when subjected to visual inspection, while the accelerometers indicate a more even hydrodynamic aquaplaning contact length (CL) across the tyre width. Secondly, the acceleration sensors predict the clear shortening of the CL of the tyre before the critical aquaplaning speed. It can be concluded that the visual contact area and shape are heavily dependent on the transparency of the liquid and smoothness of the glass. Meanwhile, the tyre sensors can provide a CL estimate on any road surface imaginable.\n\nModeling and Experimental Analysis of Piezoelectric Shakers for High-Frequency Calibration of Accelerometers\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVogl, Gregory W.; Harper, Kari K.; Payne, Bev\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPiezoelectric shakers have been developed and used at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for decades for high-frequency calibration of accelerometers. Recently, NIST researchers built new piezoelectric shakers in the hopes of reducing the uncertainties in the calibrations of accelerometers while extending the calibration frequency range beyond 20 kHz. The ability to build and measure piezoelectric shakers invites modeling of these systems in order to improve their design for increased performance, which includes a sinusoidal motion with lower distortion, lower cross-axial motion, and an increased frequency range. In this paper, we present a model of piezoelectric shakers and match it to experimental data. The equations of motion for all masses are solved along with the coupled state equations for the piezoelectric actuator. Finally, additional electrical elements like inductors, capacitors, and resistors are added to the piezoelectric actuator for matching of experimental and theoretical frequency responses.\n\nA sapphire monolithic differential accelerometer as core sensor for gravity gradiometric geophysical instrumentation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nF. Mango\n\n2006-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Gradiometric gravimetry is a survey technique widely used in geological structure investigation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of a new class of low frequency accelerometers for geodynamics studies and space applications. We present the design features of a new low noise single-axis differential accelerometer; the sensor is suitable to be used in a Gravity Gradiometer (GG system for land geophysical survey and gravity gradient measurements. A resolution of 1 EÃ¶tvÃ¶s (1 EÃ¶=10?9s?2 at one sample per second is achievable in a compact, lightweight (less than 2 kg portable instrument, operating at room temperature. The basic components of the sensor are two identical rigidly connected accelerometers separated by a 15-cm baseline vector and the useful signal is extracted as the subtraction of the two outputs, by means of an interferometric microwave readout system. The structure will be engraved in a monocrystal of sapphire by means of Computer-Numerically-Controlled (CNC ultrasonic machining: the material was chosen because of its unique mix of outstanding mechanical and dielectric properties.\n\nEffects of Cross-axis Wind Jet Events on the Northern Red Sea Circulation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMenezes, V. V.; Bower, A. S.; Farrar, J. T.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nDespite its small size, the Red Sea has a complex circulation. There are boundary currents in both sides of the basin, a meridional overturning circulation, water mass formation in the northern part and an intense eddy activity. This complex pattern is driven by strong air-sea interactions. The Red Sea has one of the largest evaporation rates of the global oceans (2m/yr), an intricate and seasonally varying wind pattern. The winds blowing over the Northern Rea Sea (NRS, north of 20N) are predominantly southeastward along the main axis all year round; in the southern, they reverse seasonally due to the monsoonal regime. Although the winds are mostly along-axis in the NRS, several works have shown that sometimes during the boreal winter, the winds blow in a cross-axis direction. The westward winds from Saudi Arabia bring relatively cold dry air and dust from the desert, enhancing heat loss and evaporation off the Red Sea. These wind-jet events may contribute to increased eddy activity and are a trigger for water mass formation. Despite that, our knowledge about the cross-axis winds and their effect on NRS circulation is still incipient. In the present work we analyze 10-years of Quikscat scatterometer winds and altimetric sea surface height anomalies, together with 2-yrs of mooring data, to characterize the westward wind jet events and their impacts on the circulation. We show that the cross-axis winds are, indeed, an important component of the wind regime, explaining 11% of wind variability of the NRS (well-described by a 2nd EOF mode). The westward events occur predominantly in the winter, preferentially in January (about 15 events in 10-years) and have a mean duration of 4-5 days, with a maximum of 12 days (north of 22N). There are around 6 events per year, but in 2002-2003 and 2007-2008, twice more events were detected. The westward wind events are found to strongly modify the wind stress curl, causing a distinct positive/negative curl pattern along the main axis\n\nTheoretical performance of cross-wind axis turbines with results for a catenary vertical axis configuration\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMuraca, R.

The unique structural configuration and common-centriod wiring of the metal electrodes enables a fully differential sensing scheme with robust metal sensing structures. CoventorWare is used in structural and electrical design and simulation of the fully differential accelerometer. The MUMPs foundry fabrication process of the sensor allows for high yield, good process consistency and provides 20 Î¼m structural thickness of the sensing element, which makes the capacitive sensing eligible. In device characterization, surface profile of the fabricated device is measured using a Veeco surface profilometer; and mean and gradient residual stress in the nickel structure are calculated as approximately 94.7 MPa and -5.27 MPa/Î¼m, respectively. Dynamic characterization of the sensor is performed using a vibration shaker with a high-end commercial calibrating accelerometer as reference. The sensitivity of the sensor is measured as 0.52 mV/g prior to off-chip amplification. Temperature dependence of the sensing capacitance is also characterized. A -0.021fF/Â°C is observed. The findings in the presented work will provide useful information for design of sensors and actuators such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and electrothermal actuators that are to be fabricated using MetalMUMPs technology.\n\nHPA AXIS RELATED GENES AND RESPONSE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES: GENETICS AND EPIGENETICS\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nRoberts, Susanna; Keers, Robert; Lester, Kathryn J.; Coleman, Jonathan R.

To advance knowledge of objective physical activity measurement during these periods, this study compares hip to wrist accelerometer compliance; assesses convergent validity (correlation between hip- and wrist-worn accelerometry; and assesses change in physical activity from pregnancy to postpartum. Methods: We recruited women during pregnancy (nâ¯=â¯100; 2014â2015, asking them to wear hip and wrist accelerometers for 7â¯days during Trimester 2 (T2, Trimester 3 (T3, and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months postpartum. We assessed average wear-time and correlations (axis-specific counts/minute, vector magnitude counts/day and step counts/day at T2, T3, and postpartum. Results: Compliance was higher for wrist-worn accelerometers. Hip and wrist accelerometers showed moderate to high correlations (Pearson's r 0.59 to 0.84. Hip-measured sedentary and active time differed little between T2 and T3. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity decreased at T3 and remained low postpartum. Light physical activity increased and sedentary time decreased throughout the postpartum period. Conclusions: Wrist accelerometers may be preferable during pregnancy and appear comparable to hip accelerometers. As physical activity declines during later pregnancy and may not rebound post birth, support for re-engaging in physical activity earlier in the postpartum period may benefit women.

A.; Forbes, J. M.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA new thermospheric wind measurement technique is reported which is based on a Satellite Electrostatic Triaxial Accelerometer (SETA) system capable of accurately measuring accelerations in the satellite's in-track, cross-track and radial directions. Data obtained during two time periods are presented. The first data set describes cross-track winds measured between 170 and 210 km during a 5-day period (25 to 29 March 1979) of mostly high geomagnetic activity. In the second data set, cross-track winds and neutral densities from SETA and exospheric temperatures from the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar are examined during an isolated magnetic substorm occurring on 21 March 1979. A polar thermospheric wind circulation consisting of a two cell horizontal convection pattern is reflected in both sets of cross-track acceleration measurements. The density response is highly asymmetric with respect to its day/night behavior. Latitude structures of the density response at successive times following the substorm peak suggest the equatorward propagation of a disturbance with a phase speed between 300 and 600 m/s. A deep depression in the density at high latitudes (less than 70 deg) is evident in conjunction with this phenomenon. The more efficient propagation of the disturbance to lower latitudes during the night is probably due to the midnight surge effect.\n\nCompact Circuit Preprocesses Accelerometer Output\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBozeman, Richard J., Jr.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nCompact electronic circuit transfers dc power to, and preprocesses ac output of, accelerometer and associated preamplifier.
