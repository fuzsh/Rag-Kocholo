The authors have demonstrated the ability of this accelerometer to be capable of acceleration measurements between Â±150G with Â±0.5G accuracy. They have further refined the original design and assembly processes to produce accelerometers with < 1mG stability in inertial measurement applications. This report covers the development, design, processing, assembly, and testing of these devices\n\nSOI Digital Accelerometer Based on Pull-in Time Configuration\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nPakula, L.S.; Rajaraman, V.; French, P.J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe operation principle, design, fabrication and measurement results of a quasi digital accelerometer fabricated on a thin silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate is presented. The accelerometer features quasi-digital output, therefore eliminating the need for analogue signal conditioning. The\n\nA digital output accelerometer using MEMS-based piezoelectric accelerometers and arrayed CMOS inverters with satellite capacitors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKobayashi, T; Okada, H; Maeda, R; Itoh, T; Masuda, T\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe present paper describes the development of a digital output accelerometer composed of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based piezoelectric accelerometers and arrayed complementary metalâoxideâsemiconductor (CMOS) inverters accompanied by capacitors. The piezoelectric accelerometers were fabricated from multilayers of Pt/Ti/PZT/Pt/Ti/SiO 2 deposited on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. The fabricated piezoelectric accelerometers were connected to arrayed CMOS inverters. Each of the CMOS inverters was accompanied by a capacitor with a different capacitance called a 'satellite capacitor'. We have confirmed that the output voltage generated from the piezoelectric accelerometers can vary the output of the CMOS inverters from a high to a low level; the state of the CMOS inverters has turned from the 'off-state' into the 'on-state' when the output voltage of the piezoelectric accelerometers is larger than the threshold voltage of the CMOS inverters. We have also confirmed that the CMOS inverters accompanied by the larger satellite capacitor have become 'on-state' at a lower acceleration. On increasing the acceleration, the number of on-state CMOS inverters has increased. Assuming that the on-state and off-state of CMOS inverters correspond to logic '0' and '1', the present digital output accelerometers have expressed the accelerations of 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 5.5 m s â2 as digital outputs of 111, 110, 100, and 000, respectively\n\nPrinciple Research on a Single Mass Piezoelectric Six-Degrees-of-Freedom Accelerometer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJingcheng Liu\n\n2013-08-01\n\nFull Text Available A signal mass piezoelectric six-degrees-of-freedom (six-DOF accelerometer is put forward in response to the need for health monitoring of the dynamic vibration characteristics of high grade digitally controlled machine tools. The operating principle of the piezoelectric six-degrees-of-freedom accelerometer is analyzed, and its structure model is constructed. The numerical simulation model (finite element model of the six axis accelerometer is established. Piezoelectric quartz is chosen for the acceleration sensing element and conversion element, and its static sensitivity, static coupling interference and dynamic natural frequency, dynamic cross coupling are analyzed by ANSYS software. Research results show that the piezoelectric six-DOF accelerometer has advantages of simple and rational structure, correct sensing principle and mathematic model, good linearity, high rigidity, and theoretical natural frequency is more than 25 kHz, no nonlinear cross coupling and no complex decoupling work.\n\nA digital output piezoelectric accelerometer using a Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 thin film array electrically connected in series\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKobayashi, T; Okada, H; Maeda, R; Itoh, T; Masuda, T\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA digital output piezoelectric accelerometer is proposed to realize an ultra-low power consumption wireless sensor node. The accelerometer has patterned piezoelectric thin films (piezoelectric plates) electrically connected in series accompanied by CMOS switches at the end of some of the piezoelectric plates. The connected piezoelectric plates amplify the output voltage without the use of amplifiers. The CMOS switches turn on when the output voltage of the piezoelectric plates is higher than the CMOS threshold voltage. The piezoelectric accelerometer converts the acceleration into a number of on-state CMOS switches, which can be called the digital output. The proposed digital output piezoelectric accelerometer, using Pb(Zr, Ti)O 3 (PZT) thin films as the piezoelectric material, was fabricated through a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) microfabrication process. The output voltage was found to be amplified by the number of connected piezoelectric plates. The DC output voltage obtained by using an AC to DC conversion circuit is proportional to the number of connections. The results show the potential for realizing the proposed digital output piezoelectric accelerometer\n\nUltraminiature resonator accelerometer\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKoehler, D.R.; Kravitz, S.H.; Vianco, P.T.\n\n1996-04-01\n\nA new family of microminiature sensors and clocks is being developed with widespread application potential for missile and weapons applications, as biomedical sensors, as vehicle status monitors, and as high-volume animal identification and health sensors. To satisfy fundamental technology development needs, a micromachined clock and an accelerometer have initially been undertaken as development projects. A thickness-mode quartz resonator housed in a micromachined silicon package is used as the frequency-modulated basic component of the sensor family. Resonator design philosophy follows trapped energy principles and temperature compensation methodology through crystal orientation control, with operation in the 20--100 MHz range, corresponding to quartz wafer thicknesses in the 75--15 micron range. High-volume batch-processing manufacturing is utilized, with package and resonator assembly at the wafer level. Chemical etching of quartz, as well as micromachining of silicon, achieves the surface and volume mechanical features necessary to fashion the resonating element and the mating package. Integration of the associated oscillator and signal analysis circuitry into the silicon package is inherent to the realization of a size reduction requirement. A low temperature In and In/Sn bonding technology allows assembly of the dissimilar quartz and silicon materials, an otherwise challenging task. Unique design features include robust vibration and shock performance, capacitance sensing with micromachined diaphragms, circuit integration, capacitance-to-frequency transduction, and extremely small dimensioning. Accelerometer sensitivities were measured in the 1--3 ppm/g range for the milligram proof-mass structures employed in the prototypes evaluated to date.\n\nDesign and Implementation of an Embedded Digital Throwing System Based on MEMS Multiaxial Accelerometer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZhen GAO\n\n2010-04-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a novel embedded digital throwing system for synchronously sensing the throwing force of shot-put athletes in real time.

The mechanical structure, signal processing system, and human-machine interface are illuminated in detail. In this manner, the force sensing system serves as a powerful tool for coaches and sports scientists to make scientific researches on professional throwing techniques. It also provides an intuitive and reliable guidance for the throwing athletes to improve their skills.\n\nA DEMODULATOR OF PWM SIGNALS GENERATED FOR A DIGITAL ACCELEROMETER IS DEVELOPED USING A MICROCONTROLLER UN DEMODULADOR DE SEÃALES PWM GENERADAS POR UN ACELERÃMETRO DIGITAL ES DESARROLLADO USANDO UN MICROCONTROLADOR\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEduardo PÃ©rez Lobato\n\n2006-08-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents the use of a microcontroller to demodulate two Pulse Width Modulated (PWM signals which are being generated by a digital accelerometer, to obtain their pulse widths and transmit them serially to a parallel port of a general purpose computer.Esta publicaciÃ³n presenta el uso de un microcontrolador para demodular dos seÃ±ales PWM que estÃ¡n siendo generadas por un acelerÃ³metro digital, obtener sus anchos y enviarlas en forma serial al puerto paralelo de un computador de propÃ³sitos generales.\n\nFeasibility of frequency-modulated wireless transmission for a multi-purpose MEMS-based accelerometer.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSabato, Alessandro; Feng, Maria Q\n\n2014-09-05\n\nRecent advances in the Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology have made wireless MEMS accelerometers an attractive tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of civil engineering structures. To date, sensors' low sensitivity and accuracy--especially at very low frequencies--have imposed serious limitations for their application in monitoring large-sized structures. Conventionally, the MEMS sensor's analog signals are converted to digital signals before radio-frequency (RF) wireless transmission. The conversion can cause a low sensitivity to the important low-frequency and low-amplitude signals. To overcome this difficulty, the authors have developed a MEMS accelerometer system, which converts the sensor output voltage to a frequency-modulated signal before RF transmission. This is achieved by using a Voltage to Frequency Conversion (V/F) instead of the conventional Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC). In this paper, a prototype MEMS accelerometer system is presented, which consists of a transmitter and receiver circuit boards. The former is equipped with a MEMS accelerometer, a V/F converter and a wireless RF transmitter, while the latter contains an RF receiver and a F/V converter for demodulating the signal. The efficacy of the MEMS accelerometer system in measuring low-frequency and low-amplitude dynamic responses is demonstrated through extensive laboratory tests and experiments on a flow-loop pipeline.\n\nFeasibility of Frequency-Modulated Wireless Transmission for a Multi-Purpose MEMS-Based Accelerometer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlessandro Sabato\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Recent advances in the Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS technology have made wireless MEMS accelerometers an attractive tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM of civil engineering structures.

The aim of this research work is to identify a MEMS accelerometer structure for human body dynamics measurements. Photogrammetry was used in order to measure possible maximum accelerations of human body parts and the bandwidth of the digital acceleration signal. As the primary structure the capacitive accelerometer configuration is chosen in such a way that sensing part measures on all three axes as it is 3D accelerometer and sensitivity on each axis is equal. Hill climbing optimization was used to find the structure parameters. Proof-mass displacements were simulated for all the acceleration range that was given by the optimization problem constraints. The final model was constructed in Comsol Multiphysics. Eigenfrequencies were calculated and modelâs response was found, when vibration stand displacement data was fed into the model as the base excitation law. Model output comparison with experimental data was conducted for all excitation frequencies used during the experiments.\n\nCompact Circuit Preprocesses Accelerometer Output\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBozeman, Richard J., Jr.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nCompact electronic circuit transfers dc power to, and preprocesses ac output of, accelerometer and associated preamplifier.

Two sets of pretests are performed in order to understand how the bond surface energy changes with the plasma exposure time and the wet etching of quartz, respectively. The developed technique is used to fabricate a multilayered quartz template for UV nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL). The multilayered quartz template is fabricated by bonding a square piece of a standard quartz wafer, which is about 625 Âµm in thickness, to a wet-etched 6.35 mm thick quartz photomask plate. A fabricated multilayered template is loaded to the commercial UV-NIL tool Imprio(TM) 100, and NIL was performed successfully. The developed direct bonding technique makes it possible for standard quartz wafers, which are compatible with high-resolution semiconductor fabrication processes, to be utilized as the templates in commercial UV-NIL machines with enhanced mechanical stability.\n\nAccelerometer method and apparatus for integral display and control functions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBozeman, Richard J., Jr.\n\n1992-06-01\n\nVibration analysis has been used for years to provide a determination of the proper functioning of different types of machinery, including rotating machinery and rocket engines. A determination of a malfunction, if detected at a relatively early stage in its development, will allow changes in operating mode or a sequenced shutdown of the machinery prior to a total failure. Such preventative measures result in less extensive and/or less expensive repairs, and can also prevent a sometimes catastrophic failure of equipment. Standard vibration analyzers are generally rather complex, expensive, and of limited portability. They also usually result in displays and controls being located remotely from the machinery being monitored. Consequently, a need exists for improvements in accelerometer electronic display and control functions which are more suitable for operation directly on machines and which are not so expensive and complex. The invention includes methods and apparatus for detecting mechanical vibrations and outputting a signal in response thereto. The apparatus includes an accelerometer package having integral display and control functions. The accelerometer package is suitable for mounting upon the machinery to be monitored. Display circuitry provides signals to a bar graph display which may be used to monitor machine condition over a period of time. Control switches may be set which correspond to elements in the bar graph to provide an alert if vibration signals increase over the selected trip point. The circuitry is shock mounted within the accelerometer housing. The method provides for outputting a broadband analog accelerometer signal, integrating this signal to produce a velocity signal, integrating and calibrating the velocity signal before application to a display driver, and selecting a trip point at which a digitally compatible output signal is generated.

In order to reduce the random noise found in the data, the sensor modeling is established and also the Kalman filter (KMF) is developed. According to these data from KMF, the maximum vibration displacement is calculated by the integration algorithm with the DC bias removed. The high performance micro controller unit (MCU) is used in the implementation of controller. By the IIC digital interface port, the data are transmitted from sensor to controller. The hardware circuits of the sensor and micro controller are designed and tested. With the computational formula of maximum displacement and FFT, the high precession results of displacement and frequency are gotten. Finally, the paper presents various experimental results to prove that this instrument is suitable for application in electrical motor vibration measurement.\n\nRole of Substrate on Quartz Cementation in Quartz Aggregates\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFarver, J. R.; Winslow, D.; Onasch, C.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nQuartz cementation in quartz aggregates has been experimentally investigated. The starting material was disaggregated detrital quartz grains from the well-sorted, mature St. Peter Sandstone. The âas-isâ grains have patches of iron oxide coatings and some have euhedral overgrowths that contain iron oxide dust rims. In addition a set of experiments was run using grains that were cleaned by soaking in sodium hydrosulfite and sodium bisulfate solutions to remove exposed iron oxide coatings. Experimental charges consisted of amorphous silica powder (â30 mg) to provide a source of silica for the quartz cement, AlCl3 powder (â3 mg) to provide a tracer for Cathodoluminescence (CL) identification of cement formed during the experiment, 25 wt% NaCl brine solution (â25 mg) to increase the silica solubility and to better mimic oil field brines, and the natural quartz grains (100-130 mg). The charges were weld-sealed in Au capsules and run in cold-seal pressure vessels at 250Â°C to 450Â°C at 150 MPa confining pressure for up to 8 weeks. After the experiments, the samples were vacuum impregnated with a low viscosity epoxy containing a blue dye. After curing, the sample charge was sawn in half along its long axis and one half was polished (to 1 micron diamond paste) for analysis. The nature and amount of quartz cement in the samples were determined by a combination of CL, light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Photomosaics of the samples were created and the amount of cement, porosity, and average grain sizes were determined by point-counting. The cement formed during the experiment was easily recognized from the quartz grains (and previous overgrowths) by the difference in luminescence. The results indicate the amorphous silica powder provides a ready source for silica for quartz cementation due to its greater solubility than the quartz. The cementation rates are rapid (>14% cement formed in 2 weeks at 450Â°C and >7% in 8 weeks at 250Â°C).

The performance of the next generation accelerometer in future geodesic satellites is pushed to 8 Ã 10 - 13 m / s 2 / H z 1 / 2 , which is close to the hardware fundamental limit. According to the instrument noise budget, the geodesic test mass must be kept in the center of the accelerometer within the bounds of 56 pm / Hz 1 / 2 by the feedback controller. The unprecedented control requirements and necessity for the integration of calibration functions calls for a new type of control scheme with more flexibility and robustness. A novel digital controller design for the next generation electrostatic accelerometers based on disturbance observation and rejection with the well-studied Embedded Model Control (EMC) methodology is presented. The parameters are optimized automatically using a non-smooth optimization toolbox and setting a weighted H-infinity norm as the target. The precise frequency performance requirement of the accelerometer is well met during the batch auto-tuning, and a series of controllers for multiple working modes is generated. Simulation results show that the novel controller could obtain not only better disturbance rejection performance than the traditional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers, but also new instrument functions, including: easier tuning procedure, separation of measurement and control bandwidth and smooth control parameter switching.\n\nA Novel Controller Design for the Next Generation Space Electrostatic Accelerometer Based on Disturbance Observation and Rejection\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHongyin Li\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The state-of-the-art accelerometer technology has been widely applied in space missions.

The modern topographic laser scanning system proved suitable for such complex environment. The Quartz Ridge in Genting Klang, Selangor, believed to be the longest ridge in the world are now preserved in a digital form and can be quantitatively analysed. Many primary and secondary data can be generated and contributed to other studies, e.g. the determination of instability slope zone and rock-fall assessment along the ridge. Remarkably, this study is a first scientific exploration on the use of advanced geo-information tool, notably laser-based mapping to record, identify, and characterize the Quartz Ridge in Genting Klang, Selangor. The recent and modern geospatial data of tropical quartz in an urban forested environment provides technical and scientific spatial data of the longest quartz ridge. The geodatabase of Klang Gate Quartz Ridge allows the integration of multi-sensor-scales of remotely sensed data with other flora and fauna data in the area. As a conclusion, this study provides an accurate physical characteristic of prominent geological structures in Selangor, and its geospatial data is leading to a better compilation of comprehensive digital record of Quartz Ridge for conserving national geoheritage, promoting geotourism, and supporting its listing effort to the UNESCO's World Heritage Site in the near future.\n\nProblems in Modelling Charge Output Accelerometers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTomczyk Krzysztof\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents major issues associated with the problem of modelling change output accelerometers.

Araujo\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The particle morphology and surface texture play a major role in influencing mechanical and hydraulic behaviors of sandy soils. This paper presents the use of digital image analysis combined with fractal theory as a tool to quantify the particle morphology and surface texture of two types of quartz sands widely used in the region of VitÃ³ria, EspÃ­rito Santo, southeast of Brazil. The two investigated sands are sampled from different locations. The purpose of this paper is to present a simple, straightforward, reliable and reproducible methodology that can identify representative sandy soil texture parameters. The test results of the soil samples of the two sands separated by sieving into six size fractions are presented and discussed. The main advantages of the adopted methodology are its simplicity, reliability of the results, and relatively low cost. The results show that sands from the coastal spit (BS have a greater degree of roundness and a smoother surface texture than river sands (RS. The values obtained in the test are statistically analyzed, and again it is confirmed that the BS sand has a slightly greater degree of sphericity than that of the RS sand. Moreover, the RS sand with rough surface texture has larger specific surface area values than the similar BS sand, which agree with the obtained roughness fractal dimensions. The consistent experimental results demonstrate that image analysis combined with fractal theory is an accurate and efficient method to quantify the differences in particle morphology and surface texture of quartz sands.\n\nA Simple Accelerometer Calibrator\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSalam, R A; Islamy, M R F; Khairurrijal; Munir, M M; Latief, H; Irsyam, M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHigh possibility of earthquake could lead to the high number of victims caused by it. It also can cause other hazards such as tsunami, landslide, etc. In that case it requires a system that can examine the earthquake occurrence. Some possible system to detect earthquake is by creating a vibration sensor system using accelerometer. However, the output of the system is usually put in the form of acceleration data. Therefore, a calibrator system for accelerometer to sense the vibration is needed. In this study, a simple accelerometer calibrator has been developed using 12 V DC motor, optocoupler, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and AVR 328 microcontroller as controller system. The system uses the Pulse Wave Modulation (PWM) form microcontroller to control the motor rotational speed as response to vibration frequency. The frequency of vibration was read by optocoupler and then those data was used as feedback to the system. The results show that the systems could control the rotational speed and the vibration frequencies in accordance with the defined PWM.

[Calgary Univ., AB (Canada); Hauer, G. [ARAM Systems Ltd, Calgary, AB (Canada)\n\n2008-07-01\n\nThe geophysical community has shown interest in the use of MEMS accelerometers as a new sensor for acquiring seismic data. Accelerometers, with their flat response in acceleration, may have advantages over geophones at low frequencies as well as high frequencies due to greater sensitivity. In this study, geophones and accelerometers were considered as simple harmonic oscillators. A method was developed to calculate ground acceleration from geophone data using a frequency-domain inverse filter and an empirical scaling constant. A comparison of acceleration-domain spectra from geophones and MEMS accelerometers from an oilfield survey at Violet Grove, Alberta, Canada revealed a distinct similarity between the geophone and accelerometer data, over a band of 5-200 Hz. The accelerometer amplitudes were larger than the geophones below 5 Hz and there were some differences at very high frequencies. Significant events related to the first breaks were not observed on the accelerometer records at some stations. It was concluded that both types of sensors can record ground motion similarly. If data from the two sensor types must be merged, a scaling factor based on matching amplitude spectra should be found. The spectra should be similar once the appropriate scaling is found, particularly around the dominant frequency. Some of the differences in data were related to high frequencies, very low frequencies, and near the first breaks. 4 refs., 6 figs.\n\nSlaw extracted proton beam formation and monitoring for the ''QUARTZ'' setup\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBushnin, Yu.B.; Gres', V.N.; Davydenko, Yu.P.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe version of optical mode of the beam channel providing with simultaneous operating the experimental setups FODS and ''QUARTZ'' at consecutive usage of the slow extracted proton beam is reported. The ''QUARTZ'' setup beam diagnostics system comprises two subsystems: for measuring beam profile beam timing structure and beam intensity and operates in the beam extraction duration from 20 ns to few seconds at beam intensity from 10 10 to 5x10 12 protons/pulse.

The VIPR program includes testing multiple critical flight sensor technologies. One such sensor, the accelerometer, measures vibrations to detect faults in the engine. In order to rely upon the accelerometer, the health of the accelerometer must be ensured. The SDA is a sensor system designed to actively determine the accelerometer structural health and attachment condition, in addition to vibration measurements. The SDA uses a signal conditioning unit that sends an electrical chirp to the accelerometer and recognizes changes in the response due to changes in the accelerometer health and attachment condition. To demonstrate the SDAs flight worthiness and robustness, multiple SDAs were mounted and tested on a C-17 aircraft engine. The engine test conditions varied from engine off, to idle, to maximum power. The SDA attachment conditions were varied from fully tight to loose. The newly developed SDA health algorithm described herein uses cross correlation pattern recognition to discriminate a healthy from a faulty SDA. The VIPR test results demonstrate for the first.\n\nModeling and Analysis of a Closed-Loop System for High-Q MEMS Accelerometer Sensor\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWang Yalin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available High-Q sensing element is desirable for high performance while makes the loop control a great challenge.

To calibrate the accelerometer, 18 preschoolers (5.8 Â± 0.4 years) performed eleven structured activities and one free play session while wearing a GT1M ActiGraph accelerometer using 15 s epochs. The structured activities were chosen based on the direct observation system Children's Activity Rating Scale (CARS) while the criterion measure of PA intensity during free play was provided using a second-by-second observation protocol (modified CARS). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to determine the accelerometer cut points. To examine the classification differences, accelerometer data of four consecutive days from 114 preschoolers (5.5 Â± 0.3 years) were classified by intensity according to previously published and the newly developed accelerometer cut points. Differences in predicted PA levels were evaluated using repeated measures ANOVA and Chi Square test. Cut points were identified at 373 counts/15 s for light (sensitivity: 86%; specificity: 91%; Area under ROC curve: 0.95), 585 counts/15 s for moderate (87%; 82%; 0.91) and 881 counts/15 s for vigorous PA (88%; 91%; 0.94). Further, applying various accelerometer cut points to the same data resulted in statistically and biologically significant differences in PA. Accelerometer cut points were developed with good discriminatory power for differentiating between PA levels in preschoolers and the choice of accelerometer cut points can result in large discrepancies.\n\nDevelopment of Dual-Axis MEMS Accelerometers for Machine Tools Vibration Monitoring\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChih-Yung Huang\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available With the development of intelligent machine tools, monitoring the vibration by the accelerometer is an important issue. Accelerometers used for measuring vibration signals during milling processes require the characteristics of high sensitivity, high resolution, and high bandwidth. A commonly used accelerometer is the lead zirconate titanate (PZT type; however, integrating it into intelligent modules is excessively expensive and difficult. Therefore, the micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS accelerometer is an alternative with the advantages of lower price and superior integration. In the present study, we integrated two MEMS accelerometer chips into a low-pass filter and housing to develop a low-cost dual-axis accelerometer with a bandwidth of 5 kHz and a full scale range of Â±50 g for measuring machine tool vibration. In addition, a platform for measuring the linearity, cross-axis sensitivity and frequency response of the MEMS accelerometer by using the back-to-back calibration method was also developed. Finally, cutting experiments with steady and chatter cutting were performed to verify the results of comparing the MEMS accelerometer with the PZT accelerometer in the time and frequency domains. The results demonstrated that the dual-axis MEMS accelerometer is suitable for monitoring the vibration of machine tools at low cost.\n\nNuclear reactor and production systems with digital controls\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLuger, P.P.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nSeveral digital sensing devices are described for use in automated production systems. The first described is for use in the automatic operation of a reactor. This device employs a binant electrometer using a quartz fiber mounted at one end but free to vibrate at the other in an AC field. The fiber oscillates if a charge is placed upon it. An optical slit replaces the ordinary eyepiece reticule scale. With the quartz fiber adjusted so its image is in focus at the optical slit, photoelectric signals are obtained at null charge on the fiber. The quartz fiber is repeatedly charged and allowed to discharge by collecting ions from a source under measurement. Each photoelectric signal causes a digital time reading to be taken. The time readings are used to evaluate the current due to the collected charge. The photoelectric signals, by feedback, also operate the electrometer for continuous or intermittent-continuous operation. Basically, the system is a current digitizer. Application is made to reactor monitoring and control as well as to other types of production systems. Finally, other types of sensing devices are also described and their use in automated controlled processes is shown. 3 claims, 19 figures\n\nColorado quartz: occurrence and discovery\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKile, D.E.; Modreski, P.J.; Kile, D.L.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe many varieties and associations of quartz found throughout the state rank it as one of the premier worldwide localities for that species.

H-OH groups also occur, but there is no direct evidence for the hydrolysis of Si-O-Si bonds to yield Si-OH HO-Si groups. Molecular H2O concentrations in the synthetic quartz crystals studied range from less than 10 to 3,300 ppm (H/Si), and decrease smoothly by up to an order of magnitude with distance away from the seed. OH- concentrations range from 96 to 715 ppm, and rise smoothly with distance away from the seed by up to a factor of three. The observed OH- is probably all associated with cationic impurities, as in natural quartz. Molecular H2O is the dominant initial hydrogen impurity in weak quartz. The hydrolytic weakening of quartz may be caused by the transformation H2O + Si-O-Si ??? 2SiOH, but this may be a transitory change with the SiOH groups recombining to form H2O, and the average SiOH concentration remaining very low. Synthetic quartz is strengthened when the H2O is accumulated into fluid inclusions and cannot react with the quartz framework. ?? 1984 Springer-Verlag.\n\nFlextensional fiber Bragg grating-based accelerometer for low frequency vibration measurement\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\nJinghua Zhang; Xueguang Qiao; Manli Hu; Zhongyao Feng; Hong Gao; Yang Yang; Rui Zhou\n\n2011-01-01\n\n@@ The intelligent structural health monitoring method,which uses a fiber Bragg grating(FBG)sensor,is a new approach in the field of civil engineering.However,it lacks a reliable FBG-based accelerometer for taking structural low frequency vibration measurements.In this letter,a flextensional FBG-based accelerometer is proposed and demonstrated.The experimental results indicate that the natural frequency of the developed accelerometer is 16.7 Hz,with a high sensitivity of 410.7 pm/g.In addition,it has a broad and flat response over low frequencies ranging from 1 to 10 Hz.The natural frequency and sensitivity of the accelerometer can be tuned by adding mass to tailor the sensor performance to specific applications.Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed FBG-based accelerometer.These results show that the proposed accelerometer is satisfactory for low frequency vibration measurements.%The intelligent structural health monitoring method, which uses a fiber Bragg grating {FBG} sensor, ie a new approach in the field of civil engineering.

Assigning behaviors to accelerometer data often involves the use of captive animals or surrogate species, as their accelerometer signatures are generally assumed to be similar to those of their wild counterparts. However, this has rarely been tested. Validated accelerometer data are needed for polar bears Ursus maritimus to understand how habitat conditions may influence behavior and energy demands. We used accelerometer and water conductivity data to remotely distinguish 10 polar bear behaviors. We calibrated accelerometer and conductivity data collected from collars with behaviors observed from video-recorded captive polar bears and brown bears U. arctos, and with video from camera collars deployed on free-ranging polar bears on sea ice and on land. We used random forest models to predict behaviors and found strong ability to discriminate the most common wild polar bear behaviors using a combination of accelerometer and conductivity sensor data from captive or wild polar bears. In contrast, models using data from captive brown bears failed to reliably distinguish most active behaviors in wild polar bears. Our ability to discriminate behavior was greatest when species- and habitat-specific data from wild individuals were used to train models. Data from captive individuals may be suitable for calibrating accelerometers, but may provide reduced ability to discriminate some behaviors. The accelerometer calibrations developed here provide a method to quantify polar bear behaviors to evaluate the impacts of declines in Arctic sea ice.\n\nQuartz fiber calorimeter\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAkchurin, N.; Doulas, S.; Ganel, O.; Gershtein, Y.; Gavrilov, V.; Kolosov, V.; Kuleshov, S.; Litvinsev, D.; Merlo, J.-P.; Onel, Y.; Osborne, D.; Rosowsky, A.; Stolin, V.; Sulak, L.; Sullivan, J.; Ulyanov, A.; Wigmans, R.; Winn, D.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA calorimeter with optical quartz fibers embedded into an absorber matrix was proposed for the small angle region of the CMS detector at LHC (CERN).

It is also used to evaluate the applicability of differential structures in MEMS manufacturing. Therefore, determining the asymmetry level has considerable significance for the design of MEMS devices. This paper proposes an experimental-theoretical method for predicting gap asymmetry in differential sensing capacitors of micro accelerometers. The method involves three processes: first, bi-directional measurement, which can sharply reduce the influence of the feedback circuit on bias output, is proposed. Experiments are then carried out on a centrifuge to obtain the input and output data of an accelerometer. Second, the analytical input-output relationship of the accelerometer with gap asymmetry and circuit error is theoretically derived. Finally, the prediction methodology combines the measurement results and analytical derivation to identify the asymmetric error of 30 accelerometers fabricated by DRIE. Results indicate that the level of asymmetry induced by fabrication uncertainty is about Â±5 Ã 10â2, and that the absolute error is about Â±0.2 Âµm under a 4 Âµm gap.\n\nSmartphone MEMS accelerometers and earthquake early warning\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKong, Q.; Allen, R.

Compared to conventional coil-and-magnet based velocity transducers, this Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) accelerometer offers several key benefits for battlefield monitoring. Many UGS require a compass to determine deployment orientation with respect to magnetic North. This orientation information is critical for determining the bearing of incoming signals. Conventional sensors with sensing technology based on a permanent magnet can cause interference with a compass when used in close proximity. This problem is solved with a MEMS accelerometer which does not require any magnetic materials. Frequency information below 10 Hz is valuable for identification of signal sources. Conventional seismometers used in UGS are typically limited in frequency response from 20 to 200 Hz. The MEMS accelerometer has a flat frequency response from DC to 5 kHz. The wider spectrum of signals received improves detection, classification and monitoring on the battlefield. The DC-coupled output of the MEMS accelerometer also has the added benefit of providing tilt orientation data for the deployed UGS. Other performance parameters of the MEMS accelerometer that are important to UGS such as size, weight, shock survivability, phase response, distortion, and cross-axis rejection will be discussed.

A novel compact nano-grating accelerometer integrating a large mass with nano-grating is proposed. First, the numbers of diffraction orders are calculated. Then, structure parameters are optimized by finite element analysis to achieve a high sensitivity in an ideal vibration mode. Finally, we design the fabrication method to form such a compact nano-grating accelerometer and successfully fabricate the uniform and well-designed nano-gratings with a period of 847 nm, crater of 451 nm by an FIB/SEM dual beam system. Based on the ANSYS simulation, a nano-grating accelerometer is predicted to work in the first modal and enables the accelerometer to have displacement sensitivity at 197 nm/G with a measurement range of Â±1 G, corresponding to zeroth diffraction beam optical sensitivity 1%/mG. The nano-gratings fabricated are very close to those designed ones within experimental error to lay the foundation for the sequent fabrication. These results provide a theoretical basis for the design and fabrication of nano-grating accelerometers\n\nGround Vibration Attenuation Measurement using Triaxial and Single Axis Accelerometers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMohammad, A.

Vibration measurement using triaxial accelerometer is needed to obtain accurate value of PPV however limited by the size and the available channel of the data acquisition module for detailed measurement. In this paper, an attempt to estimate accurate PPV has been made by using only a triaxial accelerometer together with multiple single axis accelerometer for the ground vibration measurement. A field test was conducted on soft ground using nine single axis accelerometers and a triaxial accelerometer installed at nine receiver location R1 to R9. Based from the obtained result, the method shows convincing similarity between actual PPV with the calculated PPV with error ratio 0.97. With the design method, vibration measurement equipment size can be reduced with fewer channel required.\n\nA New Annular Shear Piezoelectric Accelerometer\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nLiu, Bin; Kriegbaum, B.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThis paper describes the construction and performance of a recently introduced Annular Shear piezoelectric accelerometer, Type 4511.

This study examined associations of trail use with PA and sedentary behavior (SB) and quantified on trail PA using a combination of accelerometer and GPS data. Adults (Nâ=â142) wore accelerometer and GPS units for 1-4 days. Trail use was defined as a minimum of 2 consecutive minutes occurring on a trail, based on GPS data. We examined associations between trail use and PA and SB. On trail minutes of light-intensity, moderate-intensity, and vigorous-intensity PA, and SB were quantified in 2 ways, using accelerometer counts only and with a combination of GPS speed and accelerometer data. Trail use was positively associated with total PA, moderate-intensity PA, and light-intensity PA (PâGPS and accelerometer data for quantifying on trail activity may be more accurate than accelerometer data alone and is useful for classifying intensity of activities such as bicycling.\n\nMEMS Accelerometer with Screen Printed Piezoelectric Thick Film\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHindrichsen, Christian Carstensen; Lau-Moeller, R.; Bove, T.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA bulk-micromachined piezoelectric MEMS accelerometer with screen printed piezoelectric Pb(ZrxTil )O3(PZT) thick film (TF) as the sensing material has been fabricated and characterized.

This accelerometer has a large proof mass, which is supported inversely by two pairs of parallel leaf springs and is centered between two fixed capacitor plates. This novel design enables the proof mass to move exactly along the sensitive direction and exhibits a high rejection ratio at its cross-axis directions. Benefiting from large proof mass, high vacuum packaging, and air-tight sealing, the thermal Brownian noise of the accelerometer is lowered down to less than 0.2 ng / Hz with a quality factor of 15 and a natural resonant frequency of about 7.4 Hz . The accelerometerâs designed measurement range is about Â±1 mg. Based on the correlation analysis between a commercial triaxial seismometer and our accelerometer, the demonstrated self-noise of our accelerometers is reduced to lower than 0.3 ng / Hz over the frequency ranging from 0.2 to 2 Hz, which meets the requirement of the rotating accelerometer gravity gradiometer.\n\nOne testing method of dynamic linearity of an accelerometer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLei Jing-Yu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available To effectively test dynamic linearity of an accelerometer over a wide rang of 104âg to about 20 Ã 104g, one published patent technology is first experimentally verified and analysed, and its deficient is presented, then based on stress wave propagation theory on the thin long bar, the relation between the strain signal and the corresponding acceleration signal is obtained, one special link of two coaxial projectile is developed. These two coaxial metal cylinders (inner cylinder and circular tube are used as projectiles, to prevent their mutual slip inside the gun barrel during movement, the one end of two projectiles is always fastened by small screws. Ti6-AL4-V bar with diameter of 30âmm is used to propagate loading stress pulse. The resultant compression wave can be measured by the strain gauges on the bar, and a half âsine strain pulse is obtained. The measuring accelerometer is attached on the other end of the bar by a vacuum clamp. In this clamp, the accelerometer only bear compression wave, the reflected tension pulse make the accelerometer off the bar. Using this system, dynamic linearity measurement of accelerometer can be easily tested in wider range of acceleration values.

A Kapton polymide film is used as the structural layer for fabricating the MEMS accelerometer. The accelerometer proof mass along with four suspension beams is defined in the Kapton polyimide film.

We anticipate applications for such sensors in providing the lifeline and emergency-response communities with an immediate, comprehensive picture of the extent and characteristics of likely damage. We also foresee their use as 'filler' instruments sited between research-grade instruments to provide spatially detailed and near-field records of large earthquakes (on the order of 1000 stations at 600-m intervals in San Fernando Valley, population 1.2 million, for example). The latter applications would provide greatly improved attenuation relationships for building codes and design, the first examples of mainshock information (that is, potentially nonlinear regime) for microzonation, and a suite of records for structural engineers. We also foresee possible applications in monitoring structural inter-story drift during earthquakes, possibly leading to local and remote alarm functions as well as design criteria. This effort appears to be the first of its type at the USGS. It is spurred by rapid advances in sensor technology and the recognition of potential non-classical applications. In this report, we estimate sensor noise spectra, relative transfer functions and cross-axis sensitivity of six inexpensive sensors. We tested three micromachined ('silicon-chip') sensors in addition to classical force-balance and piezoelectric examples. This sample of devices is meant to be representative, not comprehensive. Sensor noise spectra were estimated by recording system output with the sensor mounted on a pneumatically supported 545-kg optical-bench isolation table. This isolation table appears to limit ground motion to below our system noise level. These noise estimates include noise introduced by signal-conditioning circuitry, the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and noise induced in connecting wiring by ambient electromagnetic fields in\n\nExperimental diagenesis of quartz with petroleum; Diagenese experimentale du quartz en presence d'hydrocarbures\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTeinturier, St.\n\n2002-11-01\n\nQuartz cementation has a great impact on petroleum reservoir quality by controlling the porosity and thus the gas or oil storage. However, the possible cementation of quartz during petroleum emplacement is still debated. In most cases, the reconstitution and the understanding of diagenetic processes is based on fluid inclusions studies. However, many questions concerning the representativeness and the reading of the fluid inclusions still remains misunderstood. The experiments were carried out in a silica{+-}water{+-}salts{+-}oil{+-}gas system with the objective to simulate the siliceous diagenesis of natural petroleum reservoirs and to better understand the mechanisms of fluid inclusions formation and quartz cementation in a water and/or petroleum system. Calibration curves have been established using Raman micro-spectroscopy and synthetic reference inclusions to calculate the methane content of aqueous inclusions in the H{sub 2}O-CH{sub 4}-NaCl system. A quantitative procedure for FT-IR micro-spectrometry has been developed to obtain, from individual petroleum fluid inclusions, mole % concentrations of methane, alkanes and carbon dioxide as constraints to thermodynamic modelling. Synthetic aqueous inclusions were created within quartz micro-fractures, with methane (from 150 deg C-200 bar), with petroleum (from 184 deg C-163 bar) and inside quartz overgrowth with the presence of hydrocarbons (from 277 deg C-300 bar).

Intense ion beam radiation, nominally 1 MeV protons, was deposited into material samples instrumented with shunted quartz gauges adjacent to the ion deposition zone. Fluence levels were chosen to excite three fundamentally different material response modes (1) strong vapor, (2) combined vapor and melt phase and (3) thermoelastic material response. A unique quartz gauge design was utilized that employed printed circuit board (PCB) technology to facilitate electrical shielding, ruggedness, and fabrication at sign e meeting the essential one dimensional requirements of the characterized Sandia shunted quartz gauge. Shock loading and unloading experiments were conducted to evaluate the piezoelectric response of the coupled quartz gauge/PCB transducer.

Polymer MEMS Accelerometer with beam thicknesses of 3.3 Âµ m and embedded nanocomposite piezoresistive layer having a gauge factor of 90 were fabricated. The photosensitive nanocomposite samples were prepared and characterized for analyzing the mechanical and electrical properties and thereby ensuring proper process parameters for incorporating the piezoresistive layer into the polymer MEMS accelerometer. The microfabrication process flow and unit processes followed are extremely low cost with process temperatures below 100 Â°C. This also opens up a new possibility for easy integration of such polymer MEMS with CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) devices and circuits.

Triaxial accelerometer error coefficients are relatively unstable with the environmental disturbances and aging of the instrument. Therefore, identifying triaxial accelerometer error coefficients accurately and being with lower costs are of great importance to improve the overall performance of triaxial accelerometer-based strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS. In this study, a novel artificial fish swarm algorithm (NAFSA that eliminated the demerits (lack of using artificial fishesâ previous experiences, lack of existing balance between exploration and exploitation, and high computational cost of AFSA is introduced at first. In NAFSA, functional behaviors and overall procedure of AFSA have been improved with some parameters variations. Second, a hybrid accelerometer error coefficients identification algorithm has been proposed based on NAFSA and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS approaches. This combination leads to maximum utilization of the involved approaches for triaxial accelerometer error coefficients identification. Furthermore, the NAFSA-identified coefficients are testified with 24-position verification experiment and triaxial accelerometer-based SINS navigation experiment. The priorities of MCS-NAFSA are compared with that of conventional calibration method and optimal AFSA. Finally, both experiments results demonstrate high efficiency of MCS-NAFSA on triaxial accelerometer error coefficients identification.\n\nUsing the GOCE star trackers for validating the calibration of its accelerometers\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVisser, P.

It is shown that the method provides estimates of scale factors for all three axes of the six GOCE accelerometers that are consistent at a level significantly better than 0.01 compared to the a priori calibrated value of 1. In addition, relative accelerometer biases and drift terms were estimated consistent with values obtained by precise orbit determination, where the first GOCE accelerometer served as reference. The calibration results clearly reveal the different behavior of the sensitive and less-sensitive accelerometer axes.\n\nNuclear reactor and production systems with flux-optical digitizer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLuger, P.P.; Nealen, J.P.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nSeveral digital sensing devices are described for use in automated production systems. The first described is for use in the automatic operation of a reactor. This device employs a binant electrometer using a quartz fiber mounted at one end but free to vibrate at the other in an AC field. The fiber oscillates if a charge is placed upon it. An optical slit replaces the ordinary eyepiece reticule scale. With the quartz fiber adjusted so its image is in focus at the optical slit, photoelectric signals are obtained at null charge on the fiber. The quartz fiber is repeatedly charged and allowed to discharge by collecting ions from a source under measurement. Each photoelectric signal causes a digital time reading to be taken. The time readings are used to evaluate the current due to the electric charge. The photoelectric signals, by feedback, also operate the electrometer for continuous intermittent-continuous operation. Basically the current is a current digitizer. Application is made to reactor monitoring and control as well as to other types of production systems. The flux-optical digitizer is a radiometer-like-structure carryig rotating fins that may be coated with fissionable material, such as 235 U for the purpose of neutron flux measurements. The rotating fins are mounted on a shaft that also carries an arm that produces photoelectric signals whenever the arm overlaps an optical slit and thus diminishes light from an auxiliary light flux source incident on the slit. Between successive photoelectric signals, time interval measurements are obtained.

However, the inability of many accelerometers to detect activity while the wearer is swimming or cycling may introduce a bias to the estimation of seasonality if participation in these activities are themselves seasonally patterned. We explore seasonal patterns in children's swimming and cycling among a sample of 7â8Â year olds (NÂ =Â 591 participating in the Millennium Cohort Study, UK. Participating children wore an accelerometer for one week on up to five occasions over the year and their parents completed a diary recording daily minutes spent swimming and cycling. Both swimming and cycling participation showed seasonal patterns, with 2.7 (SE 0.8 more minutes swimming and 5.7 (0.7 more minutes cycling performed in summer compared to winter. Adding swimming and cycling time to accelerometer-determined MVPA increased the summer-winter difference in MVPA from 16.6 (1.6 to 24.9Â min. The seasonal trend in swimming and cycling appears to follow the same pattern as accelerometer-measured MVPA. Studies relying solely on accelerometers may therefore underestimate seasonal differences in children's activity.\n\nPositron states and nanoobjects in proton-irradiated quartz single crystals: Positronium atom in quartz\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGrafutin, V.

V.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe influence of proton bombardment and metal atom impurities on the structure of quartz single crystals has been studied. The related defects have been studied using positron annihilation spectroscopy (angular correlation of positron-annihilation photons), acoustic absorption, and optical absorption measurements. It is shown that the presence of a narrow component f in the angular distribution of annihilation photons (ADAP), which is related to the formation of parapositronium, determines a high sensitivity of this method with respect to features of the crystal structure of quartz. It is established that the defectness of the structure of irradiated quartz crystals can be characterized by the ratio f/f 0 of the relative intensities of narrow components in the ADAP curves measured before (f 0 ) and after (f) irradiation. Any process leading to a decrease in the probability of positronium formation (e.g., positron loss as a result of the trapping on defects and the interaction with impurity atoms and lattice distortions) decreases the intensity of the narrow component. Based on the ADAP data, estimates of the radii and concentrations of nanodefects in quartz have been obtained and their variation upon annealing at temperatures up to T = 873 K has been studied\n\nQuartz crystal reinforced quartz glass by spark plasma sintering\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTorikai, D.; Barazani, B.; Ono, E.; Santos, M.F.M.; Suzuki, C.K.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Spark Plasma Sintering presents fast processing time when compared to conventional sintering techniques.
