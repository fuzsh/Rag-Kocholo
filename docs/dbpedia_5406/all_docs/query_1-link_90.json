Thats how much the federal stimulus bill devotes to the discovery, development, and implementation of various technologies. Some $20 billion will fund the increased use of electronic medical records; another $7.2 billion will support the extension of broadband Internet access to areas currently without such services. Most impressive, roughly $60 billion will be spent on energy, funding everything from energy-efficiency programs to loan guarantees for the construction of large facilities that use new biofuel and solar technologies .\n\nMost audacious, the spending bill does all this with the intention of both stimulating the economy in the immediate future and creating growth in the long term. President Obama and others in his administration have repeatedly connected the stimulus spending with the need to begin creating green jobs and building a clean-energy economy.\n\nBut just how realistic are the expectations behind the stimulus package? Can huge jumps in technology funding boost the economy? And will this sudden windfall of funding really be a positive force in encouraging new technologies?\n\nAlmost all economists agree that technological progress drives long-term economic growth. Many proponents of the technology provisions in the stimulus bill go further, however, arguing that the funding will alsocreate jobs immediately. Daniel Kammen, founding director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, estimates that investments in renewable energy create three to five times as many jobs as the equivalent investments in fossil-fuel energies. Energy efficiency and solar, in particular, have been shown to be two of the highest job-creating industries that we know, he says. And he believes there is clear evidence that spending on energy research will improve the performance and reduce the cost of renewable technologies already on the market .\n\n2. Dalai Lama: Creating a peaceful 21st century will take all 6 billion of us (Berkeleyan, April 30, 2009); story citing JANE MAULDON; http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2009/04/27_dalailama.shtml\n\nBy Cathy Cockrell\n\nHis Holiness the Dalai Lama, with his Cal Bears cap, along with UC Board of Regents Chair Richard Blum and musicians, on stage at the Greek Theatre. (Jeffery Kahn photo)\n\nBERKELEY  More than 7,000 people filled UC Berkeleys Hearst Greek Theatre to see and to hear the widely revered Dalai Lama, who spoke for close to an hour on the theme of Peace Through Compassion.\n\nHis Holiness did not disappoint. Sitting cross-legged in an armchair on the proscenium, beneath strings of fluttering Tibetan prayer flags, the 73-year-old monk called for conscious development of our human capacity for compassion. Peace does not equal absence of problems, he said. Peace is when, despite disagreement and the possibility for open conflict, people exercise restraint and will power to seek ways to solve it without coming to blows.\n\nWhile the Dalai Lama touched on Buddhist understandings of reality, on animal behavior, and the mind-body connection, his signature humility and comic timing were in play, in spontaneous asides on his childhood aversion to caterpillars and his difficulty finding the right words in English. (As I become older, my English becomes older, he declared.) One visitor, Associate Professor of Public Policy Jane Mauldon, described His Holiness as extraordinarily available, disarmingly human, and very intimate.\n\nPrior to the talk and in the presence of the Dalai Lama, [Chancellor Robert] Birgeneau presented Richard C.

Compared with unmedicated kids, average scores for medicated children were almost three points higher in math and more than five points higher in reading. The difference amounts to about three months ahead in reading and two months in math, the researchers said.\n\nBoth groups had lower scores on average than a separate group of children without ADHD. The researchers acknowledged that gap but said the benefits for medicated youngsters were still notable.\n\nWere not trying to say in this study that medication is the only answer, but the results suggest benefits that parents, educators and policy-makers shouldnt ignore, said Richard Scheffler, the lead author and professor at the University of California at Berkeleys School of Public Health.\n\nThe researchers agreed that other treatment ADHD children often receiveincluding behavior therapy and tutoringcan help, but the study didnt look at those measures .\n\nPrevious evidence suggests teachers give higher grades to ADHD kids on medication, but the study authors said that might simply mean teachers prefer them because theyre better behaved than unmedicated children.\n\nThey said theirs is the largest, longest-duration study based on objective standardized academic tests suggesting that medicated kids may be better learners, too.\n\n[University of Illinois-Chicago psychiatry professor] Dr. Bennett L eventhal, who was not involved in the study, called the results impressive .\n\nThe study appears in the May issue of Pediatrics, released Monday.

Coal generates nearly half the electricity in the United States and the world. But its the dirtiest fuel of all when it comes to carbon dioxide, or CO2, the leading greenhouse gas .\n\n... The problem is, clean coal makes putting a man on the moon look easy. The technology is called carbon capture and sequestration .\n\nDan Kammen says carbon capture would be an enormous national engineering project. Hes a Berkeley physicist and top expert on energy.\n\nCan enough carbon capture and sequestration facilities like this one be built in time to prevent climate change from coal? Pelley asked.\n\nI dont think anyone knows the answer to that precisely. We know we have to try. And we know these facilities do work. Whether we can build enough of them to preserve the coal industry as we know it today I think is a question, Kammen said.\n\nKammen told Pelley that there are hundreds of coal-fired plants in the United States, and that each one would need to be outfitted with carbon caption sequestration plants.\n\nWhat are we talking about here in terms of infrastructure? Pelley asked.\n\nSo, were talking about hundreds of billions, to a trillion dollars or so, and every power plant needs to capture its greenhouse gases, Kammen estimated .\n\n7. We Need Public Directors on TARP Bank Boards.

REICH\n\nI dont know whether Bank of America shareholders will oust Ken Lewis from his chairmanship next week. I dont know if Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will eventually do it, either. What really worries me is I dont know who would actually be responsible for doing the deed, or by what criteria .\n\nThe $45 billion weve sent to the Bank of America should give the public some say over whether Mr. Lewis remains in his job because he is now accountable to us as well as to his shareholders. But to which group should he be more accountable?\n\nAnd: Is Mr. Lewiss main job still to make money for his shareholders, or does he now have a higher public responsibility to lend more money to Main Street?\n\nThats the problem right now. Bank of Americas Ken Lewis is fully accountable to no one. AIGs public trustees have no charter or public mission to guide them. GM is trying to satisfy the Treasury and its shareholders simultaneously, and is doing neither very well. Even as the public takes larger ownership stakes in big Wall Street banks, the public has no systematic means of expressing its growing interest, whatever it is .\n\nMr. Reich is professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and a secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton.\n\n8. Former Labor Sec Grades Obamas First 100 Days (Newsroom, CNN, April 23, 2009); interview with ROBERT REICH; http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0904/23/cnr.05.html\n\nKYRA PHILLIPS: Now we know everyone has an opinion, including Robert Reich. Hes a former labor secretary under President Clinton, now a professor at UC Berkeley. And fittingly enough, hes graded the presidents first 100 days . Lets start with the ten-year budget. What would you give him on that?\n\nROBERT REICH, PROFESSOR, UC BERKELEY: I give an A. I think its an extraordinarily bold document that includes not only his campaign promises but also a vision for where America ought to be going, with regards to universal health care; protecting the country and the world from climate change; and addressing inequality. Why inequality? In fact, we have inequality today that we havent seen since the 1920s. We need to do something about that. And so that clearly gets an A.\n\nREICH: Id grade the stimulus package at a B. I think it is definitely as good as it goes, but it needs to be probably larger .\n\nPHILLIPS: But $787 billion over the next two years, itscan we afford bigger than that?\n\nREICH: Well, I suppose the question, Kyra, is can we afford not to? If we dont get the economy growing again and people back to work, then were going to be in not only the recession for a very long time, but tax revenues are not going to be coming in . So, we do need to, at least in the very short-term, have a stimulus big enough to get people back into their jobs.\n\nPHILLIPS: All right, usually we save the best for last. But in this case, its going to be the worst for last. What do you give the bank bailout?\n\nREICH: Well, first of all, Im a great fan of this administration. I think the president is doing a wonderful job . But on the bank bailout, I have to give, reluctantly, Obamanomics an F because so far it hasnt worked. The banks are lending less now than they were lending five months ago. The bank executives are still giving themselves very sweetheart deals in terms of executive pay. They are still providing dividends and thinking about acquisitions and hoarding money.\n\nThe money is not getting to Main Street. And that was the purpose of the bailout. So far, Americans have spent about $600 billion bailing out the banks, and we have very little to show for it .\n\nThe people on the right of the political spectrum generally think that the banks ought to be in some form of bankruptcy or negotiating with creditors, that theres no reason for the government to protect them from their creditors, no reason for creditors to get a free ride.\n\nPeople who tend to be on the left of the political center say we ought to nationalize the banks. Now, I could probably make a pretty good argument for either the right view or the left view, but almost nobody agrees with the administration right now that we ought to continue the policies that Hank Paulson began under the George W. Bush administration and continue to shove money in the direction of the banks, public money, shareholder money .\n\n9. California to Reward Clean Fuel Producers (KCBS Radio, April 23, 2009); features commentary by DAN KAMMEN; http://www.kcbs.com/California-to-Reward-Clean-Fuel-Producers/4258150\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (KCBS) -- California already leads the nation in clean-burning gasoline, but the Air Resources Board is expected to go even further beginning in the year 2011.\n\nIt will mean that the blend of liquid fuels that were putting into our cars is cleaner than it is today, meaning there will be less greenhouse gas emissions per mile driven, said energy professor Dan Kammen at U.C.

Excluding drought-stricken hydropower, renewable energy grew more than 3 times as fast as the U.S. economy.\n\nAccording to Dan Kammen, a leading researcher on energy and jobs, renewable energy produces twice as many jobs as traditional fossil energy for the same amount of power. Its not hard to see why: more labor goes into designing, manufacturing, selling, shipping, installing, and maintaining hundreds of small distributed renewable generation sources (e.g., windmills, solar photovoltaic arrays, etc.) than capital-intensive power plants and transmission lines. Better yet, more of that money stays in the local economy instead of being exported out of state  or worse, out of the country .\n\n11. California Report: Is Ethanol Green Enough? (KQED Public Radio, April 22, 2009); features commentary by DAN KAMMEN; http://www.kqed.org/servlets/playClip?programId=RD8&episodeId=R904220850&segment=a\n\nReported Marjorie Sun\n\nThis week, California regulators are expected to take the next big step in the states fight against climate change. The Air Resources Board is likely to approve new regulations for the fuel we put in our cars and trucks. The rules promise a big cut in greenhouse gas emissions, but the ethanol industrywhich promotes itself as making cleaner, more Earth-friendly fuelsis furious with the proposed plan .\n\nDAN KAMMEN: One of the most important features of the Low-Carbon Fuel Standard is that every fuel is being treated equally.\n\nSun: Dan Kammen is at an expert on energy issues at UC Berkeley.\n\nDAN KAMMEN: While this sounds like an ongoing process of science battling it out over numbers, what youre really seeing, I think, is the birth pangs of a new metric. Were used to thinking in terms of money; now were thinking in terms of money and carbon and then towards a larger view of sustainability where impact on communities worldwide, impact on rivers, impact on land are all going to be factored in .\n\n12. Goldman Prize boosts Bay Area environmental groups year-round (Contra Costa Times, April 19, 2009); story citing RICHARD and RHODA GOLDMAN; http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_12173009?source=most_emailed\n\nBy Suzanne Bohan - Contra Costa Times\n\nMaria Gunnoe, of West Virginia, one of six winners of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prizes to be announced in San Francisco, Calif.

Stevenson\n\nWashington -- THE recession will end. No one is marking the calendar, least of all President Obama, but the president is hinting at an audacious ambition as he waits for that inevitable if distant day: a redefining of American capitalism.\n\nIn a series of comments in recent weeks, Mr. Obama has begun to sketch a vision of where he would like to drive the economy once this crisis is past. His goals include diminishing the consumerism that has long been the main source of growth in the United States, and encouraging more savings and investment. He would redistribute wealth toward the middle class and make the rest of the world less dependent on the American market for its prosperity. And he would seek a consensus recognizing that an activist government is an acceptable and necessary partner for a stable, market-based economy.\n\nMr. Obama is stepping into the debate characteristically intent on avoiding polarizing labels, and his advisers describe his philosophy in terms of pragmatism rather than ideology .\n\nThose on the left who have criticized Mr. Obama for being too timid in addressing the immediate crisis are similarly concerned that he will miss an opportunity to reshape American capitalism more fundamentally once the economy recovers. And even liberals allied with him suggest that the risk is that his ambition will prove too limited rather than too expansive.\n\nAgain and again, Obamanomics, as well as his instincts in other areas of domestic policy, has been animated by a bold vision of what we need to do but has been quite cautious in practice, said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary under President Bill Clinton and advised Mr. Obama in the campaign.\n\nThe benefit is that he can feel his way, Mr. Reich said. The downside is that none of the initiatives may be quite bold enough to solve the problems at the scale they present themselves.\n\n15. Seminar Rethinking Development Agenda (States News Service, April 19, 2009); speech by the Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation citing ROBERT REICH.\n\nTHE HAGUE, The Netherlands -- The following information was released by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs:\n\n... I have the feeling that some people dont realise quite how serious the crisis we are facing is. It is not simply a crisis of the global financial system, but a total collapse of credit. A crisis of confidence at every level. A crisis caused in no small measure by the fact that, in the West over the past few decades, the balance between public and private interests has been lost. Short-term interests have prevailed over longer-term considerations, while many have become slaves to unbridled greed. As a result:\n\nour democratic institutions are less able to defend collective interests and curb excesses\n\nand our model for economic growth is characterised by severe imbalances that are simply not sustainable\n\nLet me start with the first of these effects. For years, sociologists have been observing the process of individualisation taking root in many Western societies. This process has brought us many good things, but compared with only twenty years ago, our circle of loyalty is shrinking in every respect. We are all increasingly focused on ourselves and those closest to us. Our sense of community involvement has grown more abstract. In many cases it has been replaced with resentment .\n\nThis process of individualisation has taken place against a backdrop of many years of deregulation and unrestrained belief in the free market. The combination of the two has damaged our traditional structures of consultation and accountability and has shifted power away from the citizen towards the investor and consumer. In his book, Supercapitalism, the American former Labor Secretary Robert Reich describes this process. He notes that while capitalism thanks to technological innovation and falling transport costs has got better and better at serving our individual desires, our democracy has grown progressively weaker when it comes to delivering what we as citizens collectively desire. This makes people less inclined to work for the collective interest, and more inclined to give in to their own personal cravings.\n\nEvery day, you can see the results all around you. Our identities as consumers and citizens seem to be locked in an ongoing Faustian struggle, in which Mephistopheles always seems to get the upper hand. As citizens we are filled with righteous indignation when an employee of a major airline is laid off after seventeen years loyal service, yet as consumers well go online the very same day, searching for bargains from low-cost carriers. Or take another example. As good citizens, we all love dolphins and urge our governments to protect them. Yet as consumers, its all too easy to opt for the cheaper, dolphin-unfriendly tuna simply because it saves us ten cents. This kind of hypocrisy, prompted partly by the inadequacy of our democratic institutions, is, as Reich rightly says, the real crisis of democracy .\n\n16. President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts (The White House Press Office, April 17, 2009); press release citing MICHAEL NACHT; http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-More-Key-Administration-Posts-4/17/2009/\n\nWASHINGTON, DC  Today, President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate the following individuals for key administration posts: Michael Nacht, Assistant Secretary of Defense (Global Strategic Affairs) .\n\nPresident Obama said, I am grateful that these fine individuals have made the admirable decision to serve their country.

Kirp\n\nChampagne corks were popping last week among supporters of same-sex marriage. No wonder: In the span of five days, the number of states where gays and lesbians could tie the knot doubled, from two to four. The Supreme Court of Iowa, a state not usually in the progressive vanguard, declared that gays had a right to marry. A few days later, Vermonts lawmakers, profiles in courage who overrode a governors veto, voted to let same-sex couples marry; that marks the first time a legislature (rather than a court) has led the charge. Exuberant advocates saw these landmark events as marking a turning point in the same-sex-marriage campaign.\n\nIts a nice thought, but far too rosy. Nationwide, same-sex marriage may well be a generation away .\n\nIn 2004, after the Massachusetts Supreme Court became the nations first tribunal to recognize same-sex marriage, the opponents mobilized. Well-heeled and well-organized, they convinced voters in 26 states to rewrite their constitutions, defining marriage as a heterosexuals-only affair. Anticipating a pro-same-sex marriage decree, three states had already passed such amendments. And 30 states dont even protect gays against discrimination .\n\nPolitical mobilizationpersuading the voters to rewrite their state constitutionsis the most promising way to make America a same-sex-marriage-friendly nation. Such retail politics will be slow going. Yet as Matthew Coles, director of the ACLUs Gay and Lesbian Rights Project, points out, its how to win hearts and mindsnot by talking about abstract issues but about the ordinary lives of gay people and how being gay makes life harder. Those will be tough conversations, but the events in Iowa and Vermont make a great conversation-starter.\n\nDavid L.

And the legalistic, mechanistic analysis shows signs of an almost inconceivable callousness. The memos serve as a vivid illustration of the moral chasm into which the nation fellor rather, was pushedduring the Bush era.\n\nPresident Obama deserves great credit for defying members of the intelligence community who wanted to keep these memos secret. But in calling for the nation to move on without any further looking back, Obama put his political needs above his moral and legal obligations .\n\nBerkeley public policy professor Michael OHare blogs: Obama has made it national policy to ignore violations of international law, human decency, and stepped on everything weve believed since Nuremberg, promising no prosecutions of CIA torturers and hinting at no prosecutions of their enablers and commanders....\n\nTorturing people systematically is not just criminal but outrageous, unspeakable.

It seems increasingly likely that Obama and Congress will slap a price on carbon in coming years that could put oil at a competitive disadvantage to such carbon-free energy sources as wind, solar, and biomass. That could reduce demand for crude, sharply cutting its price .\n\nObamas energy agenda calls for eliminating oil imports from the Middle East and Venezuelaor 27 percent of all U.S. oil importsby 2018. Such a precipitous drop could devastate Exxon Mobil, which gets nearly 40 percent of its imported crude from the Persian Gulf region, making it the largest importer of Middle Eastern oil to the U.S. The company also sees U.S. energy consumption declining, but much more slowly than Obama wants. Obama also vows to implement an economywide cap-and-trade program to reduce Americas greenhouse-gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. To seriously reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, carbon prices may need to be set high enough to push effective oil prices above $80 a barrel, which could give alternative fuel sources a big leg up, says Daniel Kammen, a University of California at Berkeley physicist who has advised Obama on energy issues.\n\nYou cant defeat the incumbent without fundamentally changing the rules of the game, Kammen says....\n\n22. US power company to tap solar energy in space (The Guardian [UK], April 16, 2009); story citing DAN KAMMEN; http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/16/solar-energy-farms-space\n\nBy Suzanne Goldenberg, US environment correspondent\n\nGround-based solar installations require huge tracts of land, and cannot produce a constant supply of electricity. Photograph: OLIVIA HAMPTON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA leading American power company is hoping to turn science fiction into reality by supporting a project to set up solar panels in outer space and beam the electricity generated back to Earth.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Company, which serves San Francisco and northern California, has agreed to buy electricity from a startup company claiming to have found a way to unlock the potential power supply in space.\n\nThe firm, Solaren Corp, says it will launch solar panels into orbit and then convert the power generated into radio-frequency transmissions, which will be beamed back down into a depot in Fresno, California. The energy would then be converted into electricity and fed into the regular power grid, PG&E said .\n\nThe sunlight hitting solar panels 200 miles in space would be 10 times as powerful as the light filtering down to Earth through the atmosphere. The satellite would then convert the energy into radio waves and beam them down to a receiving station on Earth .\n\n[Solarens CEO, Gary Spirnak] argued that the science behind the orbiting solar farms was little different to that of communications satellites. This is the exact same thing that satellites do every day. The basic technology is there, said Spirnak. The bottom line is that this is not really a technology issue.\n\nDaniel Kammen, a professor in energy and resources at the University of California, Berkeley, agreed: the most daunting challenge to Spirnak is cost.\n\nThe ground rules are looking kind of promising. Whether we can do it at scale, whether we can do it affordably, whether it is too much of a technological leap or not, those are all factors, Kammen said. It is doable. Whether it is doable at a reasonable cost, we just dont know.\n\n23. We need more stimulus, not more bailout. To jump-start the economy, we need to spur consumer demand. We cant do that without additional stimulus (Salon.com, April 14, 2009); commentary by ROBERT REICH; http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/04/14/reich/\n\nBy Robert Reich\n\nWith only $110 billion remaining in the TARP bailout fund, all signs are that Tim Geithner is preparing to return to Congress seeking more bailout money. Hell bring along the results of his bank stress tests, which will probably show many that big banks are still technically insolvent, along with bankruptcy scenarios for General Motors and Chrysler, and a couple of CEO scalps . Congress wont be happy, but in the end it will cough up another $300 billion to $500 billion.\n\nGeithner believes the only way to rescue the economy is to get the big banks to lend money again. But hes dead wrong. Most consumers cannot and do not want to borrow lots more money. Theyre still carrying too much debt as it is .\n\nThats the big issue -- the continued lack of enough demand in the economy. The current stimulus package is proving way too small relative to the shortfall between what consumers and businesses are buying and what the economy could produce at full capacity .\n\nWorse yet, the states are pulling in the opposite direction. States cannot run deficits, which means that as their revenues drop in this downturn theyre cutting vital services and raising taxes to the tune of $350 billion over this year and next. This fiscal drag is wiping out about half of the current federal stimulus .\n\nAt most, the administration is going to get only one more bite at the congressional apple. Make that more stimulus rather than more bailout.\n\nRobert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, was secretary of labor during the Clinton administration.

Mortgage interests are now so low that President Obama has begun urging Americans to refinance their homes so they can save money and start spending again .\n\nBut were not at the beginning of the end. Im not even sure were at the end of the beginning. All of these pieces of upbeat news are connected by one fact: the flood of money the Fed has been releasing into the economy .\n\nCheap money, you may remember, got us into this mess. Six years ago, the Fed (Alan Greenspan et al.) lowered interest rates to 1 percent. Adjusted for inflation, this made money essentially free to large lenders .\n\nSome of the big banks will claim to be profitable, but dont bank on it. Neither they nor anyone else knows what their assets are really worth. Besides, the big banks are sitting on over $500 billion over taxpayer equity and loans. Who knows how theyre calculating profits? Most importantly, theres still a yawning gap between the economys productive capacity and what its now producing, and absolutely nothing will turn the economy around until that gap begins to close ..\n\nRobert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, was secretary of labor during the Clinton administration.

That issue is how to distribute the emission permits that would allow companies to emit carbon dioxide and other gases: give them away for free, auction them off for a fee, or do a combination of the two .\n\nThose favoring the 100 percent auction believe emitters should have to pay for the right to pollute because the people, collectively, own the air, said Lee Friedman, professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nTo some extent, it is a matter of property rights, Mr. Friedman said. Who owns the right of clean air? If citizens own the right, then anyone who wants to soil it needs permission from those who own it and must pay a fee.\n\nSome businesses, like those in such capital-intensive industries as power generation, also appeal to a sense of fairness, Mr. Friedman said. They say that they spent millions of dollars to build power plants decades ago when people werent as concerned about emissions .\n\nThe big debate in Washington, D.C., then is how many of the permits to auction off .\n\nBut U.C. Berkeleys Mr. Friedman said whatever is agreed to wont have an effect on the larger goal of the cap-and-trade system. That aim is to gradually decrease the total emissions of the country to 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050, according to Obamas proposal.\n\nIt is a matter of fairness and equity. It has nothing to do with meeting the targets, Mr. Friedman said.\n\n27. A stronger middle class would bolster the economy (Home News Tribune (East Brunswick, NJ), April 9, 2009); editorial citing ROBERT REICH.\n\nAbout 200 people recently staged a mock funeral at the Trenton Statehouse to protest the death of the middle class.\n\nAmid widespread wage freezes and mandatory worker furloughs, not to mention scaling back property tax rebates and curtailing property tax reductions, who could blame the protesters for making a statement about their own, dwindling economic status?\n\nIn recent columns and speeches on the dire state of the U.S. economy, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich hammers home a stunning fact about the American middle class. That is, adjusted for inflation, Americas median hourly wage is barely higher than it was 35 years ago. Reich also notes that most of the expanded wealth of what been earned in America since then has gone to the richest 5 percent .\n\nReich notes that middle-class Americans have coped with their dwindling spending power over the past three decades by sending women into the workplace, borrowing against their homes and by working longer hours.\n\nNow, Reich says, theyve run out of ways to increase their purchasing power, and the economy as a whole is suffering because of it.\n\nReich suggests policies should be enacted to help reverse this trend and bolster the purchasing power of middle-class Americans. He says he would use tax credits to increase wages of the bottom two-thirds of Americans and he calls for stronger unions .\n\nMany economists agree on the benefits in having a strong middle class, and its encouraging to see our congressional delegation in Washington supporting policies to bolster it.\n\n28. Pundits escalate attacks against Obama (San Francisco Chronicle, April 9, 2009); analysis citing JACK GLASER; http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/04/09/MN1I16TJEN.DTL&type=printable\n\n--Carla Marinucci, Joe Garofoli, Chronicle Staff Writers\n\nIn March, an anti-war rally in San Francisco included some of the first anti-Obama street demonstrations in his 11-week-old administration.\n\nIt took fewer than 100 days for conservative critics to start lobbing the F-bomb at President Obama.\n\nF as in fascist.\n\nTake Glenn Beck, the bombastic Fox News host, who in recent weeks has repeatedly used the termalong with references to Mussolini and pictures of Hitler and Leninto describe Obamas efforts to revive struggling banks and automakers.\n\nThe American Spectator, a conservative publication, earlier this month ran an essay on Obama titled Il Duce, Redux?\n\nAnd TownHall.coms David Limbaugh went even further: He called Obama the head of a Gestapo government during a recent San Francisco radio interview.\n\nMaybe it is the approach of Obamas 100-day milestone, the crowded agenda of domestic and international issues or the fact that the president is no longer a White House newbie. But the recent high level of hysteria from conservative punditswhich has been dubbed the Obama Derangement Syndrome by the leftist blogosphereunderscores a crucial marker that might say as much about Obamas critics as it does about Obama himself.\n\nJack Glaser, associate professor of the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley, says the use of such hyper-heated language from the right so early into the Obama administration seems pretty clearly to be an act of desperation.\n\nThey cant get any thing to stick to him, he said, citing a New York Times poll this week that showed that two-thirds of Americans approve of Obamas job performance in office, while a record low of 31 percent said they have a favorable view of the Republican Party.\n\nCritics are grabbing on to whatever they can, Glaser observed, a tactic that is sometimes head-spinning. During the 2008 election, Obama was accused by many of these same voices of being socialist and he wasnt patriotic enough, Glaser notes. And now, hes fascist.\n\n29. Filling a Void in Climate Change. Two new web sites tackle global warming and attempt to raise awareness of the challenges we face (East Bay Express, April 8, 2009); story citing DAN KAMMEN and MICHAEL HANEMANN; http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/PrintFriendly?oid=958833\n\nBy Robert Gammon\n\nIn the 20th century, the environmental movement focused on combating air and water pollution and protecting endangered species. But, without question, the biggest environmental threat of this century is global warming. We all know the polar ice caps are melting, and that sea levels are going to rise throughout the world, thereby flooding coastal areas. But what about California? What will be the effects on the countrys largest state? In an effort to begin answering these questions, a couple of researchers with the University of California have launched a web site that they hope will raise awareness about what we need to do to combat the effects of increasing greenhouse gases.\n\nThe web site, California Climate Change Extension, features video interviews with some of the leading global warming experts in the state, including two UC Berkeley professors, Dan Kammen and Michael Hanemann .\n\nThe sites quick topic videos, in particular, provide excellent primers on California and the challenges the state faces. For example, in Climate Change Impacts on Water Supply, Hanemann notes that the state may be particularly vulnerable because we consume the vast majority of our water in the summer, when its dry, and use the least during the wet winter season. So if climate change results in a smaller snowpack each winter, it will threaten the reliability of our summer supplies. Were also likely to have longer runs of dry years and deeper droughts, noted Hanemann, the chancellors professor of Environmental Economics and Policy and the director of the CaliforniaClimateChangeCenter at UC Berkeley.\n\nBut the micro-docs also make it clear that, despite Californias leadership in the fight against global warming and the development of green technologies, the battle against climate change requires a worldwide effort . Even with dramatic growth in a number of clean energy sectors, notably solar and wind, which have been growing by more than 25 percent a year now for over a decade, overall global emissions are still rising, noted Kammen in the micro-doc, The Current State of Renewable Energy. Kammen is a nuclear energy and biofuels expert and is the director of UC Berkeleys Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory.\n\nCurrently, the web site ( Groups.ucanr.org/CAClimateChangeExt ) is geared toward the general public, but the micro-docs also could be valuable for classroom use, especially at community colleges, high schools, or even middle schools .\n\n30. Will Geithner fire corporate America?

But I suspect Geithners new tough line is mostly designed to reassure a public thats lost all faith in the wisdom of bailing out Wall Street .\n\nAll told, about one out of every five large American companies depends on government contracts, and a majority of these firms are losing money right now .\n\nRobert Reich, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, was secretary of labor during the Clinton administration.

Worry about workers (Chicago Sun-Times, April 5, 2009); commentary by ROBERT REICH.\n\nBy Robert Reich, Special to TheChicago Sun-Times\n\nThe March employment numbers, released on Friday, are bleak: 8.5 percent of Americans officially unemployed, 663,000 more jobs lost. But if you include people who are out of work and have given up trying to find a job, the real unemployment rate is 9 percent. And if you include people working part time whod rather be working full time, its now up to 15.6 percent. One in every six workers in America is now either unemployed or underemployed.\n\n... Almost every American right now is within two degrees of separation of someone who is out of work. This broader anxiety expresses itself as less willingness to spend money on anything other than necessities. And this reluctance to spend further contracts the economy, leading to more job losses .\n\nThis is still not the Great Depression of the 1930s, but it is a depression. And the only way out is government spending on a very large scale. We should stop worrying about Wall Street. Worry about American workers. Use money to build up Main Street and the future capacity of our work force.\n\nEnergy independence and a non-carbon economy should be the equivalent of a war mobilization. Hire Americans to weatherize and insulate homes across the land. Dont encourage General Motors or any other auto company to shrink. Use the automakers spare capacity to make buses, new wind turbines and electric cars (why let the Chinese best us on this?). Enlarge public transit systems.\n\nMeanwhile, extend our educational infrastructure. So many young people are out of work that they should be using this time to improve their skills. Expand community colleges. Enlarge Pell Grants. Extend job-training opportunities to the unemployed, so they can learn new skills while theyre collecting unemployment benefits.\n\nFinally, accelerate universal health care.\n\nRobert Reich was secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton.\n\n[Robert Reich was cited on the topic in numerous other reports including Bloomberg News (April 6, 2009); http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=apllk4murp0I&refer=us and The Seattle Times (April 3, 2009); http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/soundeconomyblog/2009/04/03/why_the_unemployment_epidemic.html ]\n\n32. Livermore school trying new growth experiment (Tri-Valley Herald, April 5, 2009); story citing ROBERT MACCOUN; http://www.insidebayarea.com/trivalleyherald/localnews/ci_12073134\n\nBy Jeanine Benca, Valley Times\n\nLivermore  A recent decision by the Livermore school board will give some students an alternative to the nightmare of transitioning into middle school.\n\nBoard members in March OKd the transformation of the former kindergarten through fifth-grade Joe Michell School into the districts first kindergarten through eighth-grade school, much to the delight of parents and school staff who have been pushing for the change for several years....\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests the K-8 trend may be growing, said Robert Maccoun, a UC Berkeley public policy expert....\n\nA recent UC Berkeley study co-authored by MacCoun supports the idea that children who stay in grade school longer perform better than those who dont.\n\nThe study, in which sixth-graders who went from K-5 to a traditional middle school were compared with those who attended a K-6 school before moving on to a seventh- and eighth-grade-only middle school, found that sixth-graders in the latter group had higher test scores and fewer behavioral problems.\n\nThey were statistically identical in fifth grade, but the kids who went to (a 6-8 school) saw a significant increase in delinquency and significant decrease in standardized test scores, MacCoun said. Still, he called the results of the K-8 debate inconclusive.\n\nOn the one hand, not moving sixth-graders is beneficial, but on the other hand, having seventh- and eighth-graders in the same building on campus is probably somewhat detrimental for the younger kids, MacCoun said.\n\n33. Goldman School portal takes the worry out of experiments of concern. New site aims to warn synthetic biologists when the fruits of their research could include biosecurity risks (Berkeleyan, April 2, 2009); story citing STEVE MAURER and JASON CHRISTOPHER; http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2009/04/02_concern.shtml\n\nBy Barry Bergman, Public Affairs\n\nSteve Maurer (Photo by Peg Skorpinski)\n\nBERKELEY  Scientists call them experiments of concern  research projects designed to advance human knowledge or cure disease, but with potentially lethal applications should the results fall into in the wrong hands. The burgeoning field of synthetic biology, which aims for nothing less than to chemically engineer new forms of microbial life (or replicate existing ones), poses special risks.\n\nYet just how concerned we need be about such experiments is an open question. Now Steve Maurer, director of the Information Technology and Homeland Security Project at the Goldman School of Public Policy, is about to launch an online advice portal he hopes will not only provide some answers, but will also represent a significant step toward mitigating the dangers  whatever they might be  of well-intentioned synthetic-biology research.\n\nThe Berkeley-based website, created under the technical supervision of Goldman IT manager Jason Christopher, aims to give researchers a terrorists-eye view of the possible weaponry applications of their work before they begin an experiment, much less try to publish their findings. Maurer has lined up a stable of some two dozen volunteer reviewers  including security experts from academia, D.C. think tanks, and national laboratories  who will form rotating three-person panels to weigh in on the wisdom of moving ahead with a given project.\n\nAlthough the advice wont be binding, Maurer hopes the existence of the portal  along with a new virulent-gene database, VIREP, he and Christopher are working to create  will give the synthetic-biology community a meaningful way to regulate its own behavior .\n\nThe seeds of the project were planted in 2005, when the GoldmanSchool established a new initiative on homeland security. Maurer and his colleagues were soon in talks with the Carnegie Foundation, which shared their interest in biosecurity and is now, with the MacArthur Foundation, one of the portals key backers.\n\nWe said to them, Look, since Sept. 11 everybody in synthetic biology a big new advanced discipline at Berkeley  has been talking about, Gee, could this science be misused, and is there anything that the government or the community or somebody should do to manage the risk?\n\nThe technological challenge of VIREP [a state-of-the-art bioinformatics database intended to aid gene-synthesis companies in their efforts to keep short DNA sequences away from all but legitimate researchers], explains Christopher, is to create a site where commercial suppliers of genetic material can share and preserve information about suspicious genes  information thats typically discarded after a company, prompted by a request from a researcher, searches the scientific literature  so that genetically engineered threats can be nipped in the bud. He traveled with Maurer last year to Munich to present the concept to an industry group, and is in talks with software developers .\n\nEfforts to keep synthetic-biology research from being weaponized are themselves experimental, Maurer stresses, and dont readily lend themselves to government regulation. Its very important to grasp this nettle and do it, he says. Well put down the best effort we can, and if other people do it better  and they surely will, because they will have seen what we did  thats great.\n\nMy best outcome, he adds, is that the government can take it away from me eventually.\n\n34. G-20 Communique Contains Just Enough Substance to be Considered a Success (CNN Newsroom, April 3, 2009); features commentary by ROBERT REICH.\n\nHEIDI COLLINS: The world leaders walked away from the G-20 on a positive note with some new policies and ideas in their pockets. But we want to know what comes next Secretary Reich, so we have this communique, and youve heard some of the details, Im sure. But a lot of people are wondering, now what? I mean, is there any sort of guarantee that this has really stopped the downturn of a global economic crisis?\n\nROBERT REICH, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR: Heidi, absolutely no guarantee at all. I mean, the good news coming out of the G-20 is what did not happen. Nobody walked out. The global leaders did not say, were going to resort to protectionism, were going to protect our own jobs and our own companies instead of joining together.\n\nAnd there was a commitment to a trillion dollars for poor nations to help their economies. Look, nobody ever expected the G-20 was going to be the turnaround for the global economy, but it was a step in the right direction .\n\nWell, I can tell you as somebody who has been at international conferences and cabinet ministers, these things are so big, so unwieldy, it is so difficult to get different leaders with different political agendas together on the same page, marching in the same direction. Its a miracle they came out with something actually quite positive.\n\nAnd I dont want to understate how positive it was. This trillion dollars for developing nations is very important. But the big action is going to be back in individual nations in terms of stimulus packages and getting the banking systems actually working again, and that means the leaders go back home, and then the work really starts .\n\n... They are facing electorates that are suffering from increasing joblessness. Here in the United States, we just got the reports ... on Marchs job numbers. Absolutely awful. And I think that Barack Obamas going to come back and maybe even go back to Congress, asking for an additional stimulus package. Because there is such a huge gap globally and in the United States and in every other nation between what could be produced at full employment.\n\nAnd now, where we are right now, one out of six Americans is either unemployed or underemployed. This isits not a depression officially, Heidi, but its pretty close to what we might call a depression .\n\n(VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: We cant give up on open markets, even as we work to ensure that trade is both free and fair. We cannot forget how many millions that trade has lifted out of poverty and into the middle class. We cant forget that part of the freedom that our nation stood for throughout the Cold War was the opportunity that comes from free enterprise and individual liberty .\n\nCOLLINS: Secretary Reich, to you first. Free markets, free trade going to suffer here?\n\nREICH: Well, they already are suffering, Heidi. I mean, even giving extra money to General Motors and to Chrysler and not to the Japanese automakers in the United States who are hiring American workers is a form of protectionism. Deciding that were going to have Buy America provisions in our stimulus package, while I dont oppose those provisions, that is a form of protectionism.\n\nAnd every other government around the world right now is also having enormous pressure, coming under enormous pressure from its own companies and its own workers to protect them and to favor them, with regard to all kinds of subsidies and tax credits . So protectionist pressures are inevitably growing .\n\nCOLLINS: [W]e just passed this budget yesterday, as you heard last night, $3.53 trillion. You know, I know Im not alone when I think about the deficit .\n\nKEITH HENNESSEY: My big problem is massive increases in spending and massive increases in taxes. I just think its bad in the short run, and I think with the long-term entitlement spending trends weve got, weve got to deal with spending. Weve got to start getting it under control now .\n\nREICH: Well, heres where I would disagree with Keith. I think right now, when consumers are not spending and businesses are not spending and export markets are dead in the water, there is only one spender left, the spender of last resort, and that is government. If we want people to get jobs back, if we want the economy to get actually back on track, theres no substitute for government spending that stimulates the economy. My big fear is that the stimulus package we have now may be just too small .\n\n35. Green buildings and higher rents linked.
