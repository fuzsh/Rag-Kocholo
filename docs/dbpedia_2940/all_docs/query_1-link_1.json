It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Djimon Hounsou.[4][5][6]\n\nCrowe portrays the Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena, determined to avenge the murders of his family and the emperor.\n\nThe screenplay, initially written by Franzoni, was inspired by the 1958 Daniel P. Mannix novel Those About to Die. The script was acquired by DreamWorks Pictures, and Scott signed on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999 and wrapped in May of that year. Production was complicated by the script being rewritten multiple times and by the death of Oliver Reed before production was finished.\n\nGladiator grossed $465.4 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2000. Critics praised the acting, directing, cinematography, production design, and musical score. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Crowe. A sequel, titled Gladiator II, is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 15, 2024.[7]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 180 AD, the Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against Germanic tribes near Vindobona. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Angered by this decision, Commodus secretly murders his father.\n\nCommodus proclaims himself the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested by Praetorian Guards led by Quintus, who tells him that he and his family will die. Maximus kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and son executed. Maximus buries them and collapses from his injuries. He is found by slave traders, who take him to Zuccabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis and sell him to the gladiator trainer Proximo.\n\nMaximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He earns the nickname \"the Spaniard\" and befriends Juba, an African gladiator from Carthage. In Rome, Commodus organizes 150 days of gladiatorial games to commemorate his father and win the approval of the Roman public. Upon hearing this, Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to gain his freedom.\n\nProximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the arena as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory and wins the crowd's support. Commodus and his young nephew, Lucius, enter the Colosseum to offer their congratulations. Seeing Lucius, Maximus refrains from attacking Commodus, who orders him to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus live. That evening, Maximus is visited by Lucilla, his former lover and Commodus's sister. Distrusting her, Maximus refuses her help.\n\nCommodus arranges a duel between Maximus and Tigris of Gaul, an undefeated gladiator. Several tigers are set upon Maximus, but he prevails. At the crowd's desire, Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his life in defiance. In response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", angering Commodus. To provoke Maximus, Commodus taunts him about the murder of his family, but Maximus resists the urge to strike him. Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have every senator followed, and refuses to have Maximus killed for fear he will become a martyr.\n\nMaximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal to him. He meets in secret with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions in Ostia, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. The Praetorians arrest Gracchus. Lucilla meets Maximus at night to arrange his escape; they share a kiss. Commodus becomes suspicious when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.\n\nCommodus demands that Lucilla provide him with an heir. He challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum to win back public approval, and stabs him before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injury, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After Quintus and the Praetorians refuse to help him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wound, he asks for political reforms, the emancipation of his gladiator allies, and the reinstatement of Gracchus as senator. As he dies, Maximus envisions reuniting with his wife and son in the afterlife. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\" and carry his body out of the arena. That night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRussell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius: A Hispano-Roman general forced into slavery who seeks revenge against Emperor Commodus for the murder of his family and the previous emperor, Marcus Aurelius.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Commodus: The amoral and power-hungry son of Marcus Aurelius.

Mannix novel Those About to Die [a], which gave him the idea for Gladiator.[8]\n\nTwenty-five years later, Franzoni wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg's Amistad, which was Spielberg's first film for DreamWorks Pictures. Though Amistad was only a moderate commercial success, DreamWorks was impressed with Franzoni's screenplay and gave him a three-picture deal as writer and co-producer.[9] Remembering his 1972 trip, Franzoni pitched his gladiator story idea to Spielberg, who immediately told him to write the script.[8] After reading the ancient Roman text Historia Augusta, Franzoni chose to center the story on Commodus. The protagonist was Narcissus, a wrestler who, according to the ancient historians Herodian and Cassius Dio, strangled Commodus to death.[9]\n\nDreamWorks producers Walter F. Parkes and Douglas Wick felt that Ridley Scott would be the ideal director to bring Franzoni's story to life. They showed him a copy of Jean-Léon Gérôme's 1872 painting Pollice Verso, which Scott said portrays the Roman Empire \"in all its glory and wickedness\". He was so captivated by the image that he immediately agreed to direct the film. When Parkes pointed out that Scott did not know anything about the story, Scott replied, \"I don’t care, I’ll do it.\"[12]\n\nOnce Scott was onboard, he and Franzoni discussed films that could influence Gladiator, such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, La Dolce Vita, and The Conformist.[8] However, Scott felt Franzoni's dialogue lacked subtlety, and he hired John Logan to rewrite the script. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's desire for revenge.[13] In November 1998, DreamWorks reached a deal with Universal Pictures to help finance the film: DreamWorks would distribute the film in North America, while Universal Pictures would distribute it internationally.[14]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore Russell Crowe was cast as Maximus, several other actors were considered for the role, including Antonio Banderas, Mel Gibson, and Tom Cruise.[8] However, producers had Crowe at the top of their list after his breakout performance in L.A. Confidential (1997).[8] Jude Law auditioned for Commodus, but Joaquin Phoenix was offered the part after sending in a \"knockout\" audition tape.[15][8] Jennifer Lopez reportedly auditioned for Lucilla, but the role went to Connie Nielsen.[16]\n\nPrincipal photography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was shot at three main locations between January and May 1999.[17] The opening battle scene set in the forests of Germania was shot at Bourne Wood, near Farnham, Surrey, in England. When Scott learned that the Forestry Commission was planning to remove a section of the forest, he obtained permission to burn it down for the scene. The scenes of slavery, desert travel, and the gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The scenes set in Rome were shot in Malta, where the crew built a replica of about one-third of the Colosseum to a height of 52 feet (16 meters). The other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally.[21] The scenes of Maximus's farm were filmed in Val d'Orcia, Italy.[22]\n\nWhen filming battle scenes, Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and used a 45-degree shutter, which resulted in stylized visuals similar to those found in Saving Private Ryan.[23] For the fight sequence involving tigers, both real tigers and a dummy tiger were used. Some of the live animals were filmed on set with the actors, and some were filmed against a bluescreen and then digitally composited into the scene.[24][25]\n\nCrowe was injured multiple times during principal photography. Describing the impact filming had on his body, Crowe said, \"I've still got a lot of little scar[s]\". He added, \"I've had Achilles tendons go out, knees go out, both shoulders, this shoulder's actually had an operation on it ... I've got a lower back thing that just won't go away, and that's from a couple, sort of, fall impacts during fight sequences\".[16] Oliver Reed died of a heart attack on May 2, before all his scenes had been filmed. His character, Proximo, was meant to survive, but after Reed's death the script was revised to include his death at the hands of the Praetorian Guard. To make it appear that Reed had performed the entirety of Proximo's scenes, a body double was used, and Reed's face was digitally attached to the body of the double in post-production.[b] The film is dedicated to Reed.\n\nScript complaints and revisions\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Franzoni and Logan completed a second draft of the screenplay in October 1998, Crowe has claimed that the script was \"substantially underdone\" when filming began three months later. In an interview with Inside the Actors Studio, Crowe said the crew \"started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.\"[28][29] The script was constantly changing throughout principal photography, with Scott soliciting input from writers, producers and actors.[12] Some dialogue was created on the spot, such as Commodus's line \"Am I not merciful?\", which was ad-libbed by Phoenix.[16] Crowe invented the phrase \"Strength and Honor,\" which is a modified version of the Latin motto of his high school, \"Veritate et Virtute,\" which translates as \"Truth and Virtue.\"[29] Crowe also improvised part of the scene in which Maximus describes his home to Marcus Aurelius. Instead of recounting the details of a fictional place, Crowe described his own home in Australia.[30]\n\nAt one point, William Nicholson was hired to rewrite the script to make Maximus a more sensitive character. He reworked Maximus's friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife plot thread. He said he \"did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody\".[13] Crowe, however, was unhappy with some of Nicholson's dialogue. He called it \"garbage\", but claimed he is \"the greatest actor in the world\" and can \"make even garbage sound good.\"[16] According to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe \"tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.\"[31]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Gladiator (2000 soundtrack)\n\nThe musical score for Gladiator was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. The original soundtrack for the film was produced by Decca Records and released on April 25, 2000. Decca later released three follow-up albums: Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture (2001), Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition (2005), and Gladiator: 20th Anniversary Edition (2020).[citation needed]\n\nIn 2006, the Holst Foundation accused Hans Zimmer of copying the work of the late Gustav Holst in the Gladiator score. The organization sued Zimmer for copyright infringement and the case was settled out of court.[32]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nInitial theatrical release\n\n[edit]\n\nGladiator was released in the United States and Canada on May 5, 2000.[33] It earned $34.8 million during its opening weekend, making it the number one film of the weekend, and it remained number one in its second weekend, earning $24.6 million.[34][35] During its third weekend, Gladiator fell to second place with $19.7 million, behind Dinosaur ($38.9 million).[36] The film spent a total of ten weeks in the top ten at the box office, and was in theaters for over a year, finishing its theatrical run on May 10, 2001. Its total gross in the United States and Canada was $187.7 million.[37] Gladiator opened on May 12, 2000 in the United Kingdom, and grossed £3.5 million in its opening weekend. It spent seven weeks at number one, and its total gross surpassed $43 million.[c] The film was also number one for seven weeks in Italy, and for five weeks in France.[d] Outside of the United States and Canada, Gladiator grossed $272.9 million, for a total worldwide gross of $460.6 million against a budget of $103 million.[37] It was the second-highest grossing film worldwide in 2000, behind Mission: Impossible 2 ($546.4 million).[44]\n\nSubsequent theatrical releases\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2020, Gladiator was re-released in Australia and the Netherlands to commemorate its 20th anniversary. This limited released grossed $4.8 million. The following year, it was re-released in the United Kingdom, earning a gross of $16,257.[37]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nGladiator was first released on DVD and VHS on November 21, 2000, and generated $60 million in sales within the first week.[45][46] In September 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray, and in May 2018 it was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray.[47] An extended version of the film, with 16 extra minutes of footage, is also available on all three formats.[citation needed]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nGladiator received many positive reviews upon its initial release, with critics calling it \"magnificent\", \"compelling\", and \"richly enjoyable\".[e] Crowe's performance in particular received acclaim. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgensten said that Crowe \"doesn't use tricks in this role to court our approval. He earns it the old-fashioned way, by daring to be quiet, if not silent, and intensely, implacably strong.\"[51] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Crowe brings an \"essential physical and psychological reality to the role\", while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said that Crowe uses \"his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.\"[52][53] Variety called Crowe's performance \"simply splendid\".[49]\n\nCritics also praised Scott's directing and the visual style of the film. Manohla Dargis of LA Weekly commended Scott's state of the art filmmaking and expressed admiration for the film's \"breathtaking, brutal lyricism\".[54] Entertainment Weekly called the opening battle sequence \"extraordinary\", and described Scott as a \"visual artist at his most deluxe.\"[55] Michael Wilmington of The Chicago Tribune called Gladiator \"visually electrifying\".[48] In addition to Crowe's acting and Scott's directing, reviewers also applauded John Mathieson's cinematography, Arthur Max's production design, and the musical score composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard.[f]\n\nAlthough critics lauded many aspects of Gladiator, some derided the screenplay. Ian Nathan of Empire magazine called the dialogue \"pompous\", \"overwritten\", and \"prone to plain silliness\".[56] Roger Ebert said the script \"employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\"[57] Manohla Dargis called the story predictable and formulaic.[54]\n\nIn his 2004 book The Assassination of Julius Caesar, the political scientist Michael Parenti described Gladiator as \"unencumbered by any trace of artistic merit\". He also criticized the film's depiction of Roman citizens, claiming that it portrays them as bloodthirsty savages.[58]\n\nAudiences polled on Gladiator's opening day by the market research firm CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[59] On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Gladiator has a critics' approval rating of 80% based on 259 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10.[60] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[61]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nGladiator won five awards at the 73rd Academy Awards, and was nominated for an additional seven.\n\nWins\n\nBest Picture\n\nBest Actor (Russell Crowe)\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nBest Sound\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nAdditional nominations\n\nBest Director\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nBest Supporting Actor (Joaquin Phoenix)\n\nBest Original Score\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nBest Art Direction\n\nBest Film Editing[62]\n\nAt the 58th Golden Globe Awards, the film won two awards and was nominated for an additional three.\n\nWins\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\nBest Original Score – Motion Picture\n\nAdditional nominations\n\nBest Actor – Motion Picture Drama (Russell Crowe)\n\nBest Director\n\nBest Supporting Actor – Motion Picture Drama (Joaquin Phoenix)[63]\n\nGladiator also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film.[64] In 2021, Empire magazine ranked Gladiator 39th on its \"100 Best Movies Of All Time\" list, and declared it the 22nd best film of the 21st century.[65][66] The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes included the film on its list of \"140 Essential 2000s Movies.\"[67] The character Maximus placed 95th on Empire's list of 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[68]\n\nHistorical accuracy\n\n[edit]\n\nGladiator is loosely based on real events that occurred within the Roman Empire in the latter half of the 2nd century AD. Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, so he hired several historians as advisors. Nevertheless, some deviations from historical facts were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were \"too unbelievable\" to include. For instance, in an early version of the script, gladiators endorsed products in the arena; while this would have been historically accurate, there was concern that audiences would think it anachronistic.[69]\n\nAt least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits. Allen Ward, a historian at the University of Connecticut, believed that a higher level of historical accuracy would not have made Gladiator less interesting or exciting. He asserted that filmmakers must be granted some artistic license when adapting historical events, but this license should not be employed to completely disregard facts.[71]\n\nFictionalization\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus; he died at Vindobona (modern Vienna) in 180 AD from the Antonine Plague. The epidemic, believed to be either smallpox or measles, swept the Roman Empire during his reign.\n\nThere is no indication that Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a republican form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone until his death in 192 AD.\n\nThe film depicts Marcus seizing victory in the Marcomannic Wars. In reality, the war was ongoing when he died. Commodus secured peace with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome, the Marcomanni and the Quadi, immediately after his father's death.\n\nThe character Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resembles Spartacus, who led a slave revolt, and Marcus Nonius Macrinus, a general and friend of Marcus Aurelius.[75][76][77]\n\nAlthough Commodus engaged in show combat in the Colosseum, he was not killed in the arena; he was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus. Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film.[78]\n\nIn the film, Lucilla is depicted as the widow of Lucius Verus. She has one son, also named Lucius Verus. In reality, Lucilla's son died long before the reign of Commodus, and she remarried Claudius Pompeianus soon after Verus's death. She had been married to Claudius for 11 years by the time her brother became Emperor, and her only living son during this time was Aurelius Pompeianus.[79]\n\nThe real-life Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with several others. She was first exiled to the island of Capri by Commodus, then executed on his orders later in the year.\n\nIn the film, Marcus banned gladiatorial games in Rome. The real Aurelius, however, banned games only in Antioch. No games were ever banned in Rome.\n\nIn reality, the death of Commodus did not result in peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the Year of the Five Emperors in AD 193. According to the historian Herodian, the Roman people were overjoyed at the news of Commodus's death, although they feared that the Praetorians would not accept the new emperor Pertinax.[82]\n\nAnachronisms\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Gladiator takes place in the 2nd century AD, the Imperial Gallic armor and the helmets worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. The centurions, cavalry, standard bearers, and auxiliaries would have worn scale armor, known as lorica squamata.[83][84] The Praetorian Guards wear purple uniforms in the film, but this wardrobe is not corroborated by historical evidence. On campaign, they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements.[85] Gladiator depicts Germanic tribes wearing clothing from the Stone Age, which ended more than 2,000 years before the events of the film.[86]\n\nThe film shows the Roman cavalry using stirrups. In reality, the cavalry used a two-horned saddle without stirrups. The stirrups were employed during filming because riding with a Roman saddle requires additional training and skill. According to the classical scholar Martin Winkler, catapults and ballistae would not have been used in a forest, as they were reserved primarily for sieges and were rarely used in open battles. There is no documentation of the use of flaming arrows or flaming catapult canisters in ancient history.\n\nSequel\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Gladiator II\n\nA sequel to Gladiator, titled Gladiator II, is scheduled to be released in the United States on November 15, 2024.[7] International release dates have yet to be announced.\n\nThe film is directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa.
