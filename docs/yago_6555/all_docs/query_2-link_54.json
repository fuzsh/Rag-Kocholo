        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nAdvances in nanotechnology have been touted to be very promising with applications in a large number of disciplines, and projected to be a trillion dollar market by 2015 (Maynard 2007; Roco 2004). A key factor is that the building blocks, nanoparticles, have unique physicochemical properties and functionalities that are different from their bulk counterparts (Harman et al. 2002; McDonald et al. 2005). In recent years, there has been an increased concern about the potential of these nanoparticles to be emitted to the environment, followed by exposure of human beings and resultant adverse health effects (Biswas and Wu 2005; Oberdorster 2004; Wiesner et al. 2006). There is supporting evidence of adverse health effects following exposure to nanoparticles present in the atmosphere and from combustion source emissions (Donaldson et al. 2002; Donaldson et al. 2001; Donaldson and Tran 2002; Penttinen et al. 2001; Wichmann and Peters 2000). Due to the importance of this size class of particles, the term nanotoxicology has been coined that aims to establish the relationship between nanoparticle physicochemical properties (e.g. size, surface properties and crystal phase) and their toxic potential (Oberdorster et al. 2005a; Oberdorster et al. 2005b; Oberdorster et al. 2007).\n\nIn spite of the large number of studies aimed at establishing the biological activity of nanoparticles and the influence of important physico-chemical parameters such as size, surface properties, crystal phase and others (Hoshino et al. 2004; Magrez et al. 2006; Oberdorster et al. 2005b); the use of appropriate dose metrics needs to be carefully considered. For example, to determine the effect of size of the nanoparticle on biological activity, should comparisons of activity or biological response be based on the mass of the sample, as is done in conventional toxicological studies, or should the metric be total surface area when comparing effects of different sized particles?\n\nThere is still uncertainty in the current understanding of the relationship between physico-chemical parameters and potential toxicological effects. For example, there have been several recent studies on the toxicity evaluation of nanosized titanium dioxide (a widely used nanomaterial) and establishing a relationship to physico-chemical characteristics (Oberdorster 2000; Oberdorster et al. 2005b; Sayes et al. 2006; Warheit et al. 2007; Warheit et al. 2006). Warheit and co-workers recently dosed the lungs of rats with 3 sizes of titanium dioxide nanoparticles and suggested that toxicity is not dependent upon particle size or surface area (Warheit et al. 2006). A clear conclusion regarding particle size could not be reached as only 3 sizes were tested, of which one was of a different crystal phase, and the two of the same crystal phase (rutile) were of different shapes (rods, ∼200 nm × 40 nm, and dots, ∼10 - 20 nm). In a follow up study, these authors tested the pulmonary toxicity of 3 sizes (hydrodynamic diameter: 136 nm, 149 nm and 382 nm) of the rutile phase with alumina surface coating, and compared it to 25 nm TiO2 particles (of a different crystal phase) (Warheit et al. 2007). In a third study, they examined the toxic potential of 3 samples of different crystal phases, however, the sizes were also different (Sayes et al. 2006). Surface properties were proposed to account for the differences in biological responses. Oberdörster et al (Oberdorster 2000; Oberdorster et al. 2005b) conducted pulmonary toxicity tests with 20 nm (80% anatase) and 250 nm (100% anatase) titanium dioxide particles and found that the total surface area was a metric that related to neutrophil lung inflammation in rats. No clear trends with regard to the influence of TiO2 crystallinity and particle size on biological activity could be seen in these different studies and contrasting concepts were proposed. One major reason was the paucity of different well-characterized TiO2 samples (in terms of size and crystallinity) that were used, thus precluding the development of convincing conclusions about the function of parameters such as particle size or crystal phase.\n\nRecent developments in aerosol route synthesis of these materials allow for greater and independent control of physico-chemical properties such as size, shape and crystal phase (Jiang et al. 2007). Flame aerosol reactors have been used in several studies (Thimsen and Biswas 2007; Wegner and Pratsinis 2003; Yang et al. 1996), and are also a preferred route of production of nanomaterials in industrial scale systems (Rosner 2005). Recent studies have illustrated the potential of varying these parameters in a well controlled manner and have demonstrated the synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles over a range of sizes.\n\nWhile toxicological effects are usually evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies, a rapid cell-free pre-screening assay to determine the intrinsic potential of particles to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be informative as well (Venkatachari et al. 2005). Both in vitro and in vivo tests of engineered nanoparticles (e.g. carbon nanotubes, TiO2 and quantum dots) indicate that ROS production is related to their toxicity (Donaldson et al. 2006; Hoshino et al. 2004; Oberdorster et al. 2007). In this study, the oxidant generating potential in a cell-free medium has been used as a pre-screening method to evaluate the dependence of the TiO2 reactivity on physico-chemical properties.\n\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate an appropriate dose metric for oxidant generation to establish the role of particle size and crystal phase of a model nanoparticle, titanium dioxide. The hypothesis is that both size and crystallinity will impact oxidant generation. The primary limitation of few samples in previous studies reported in the literature has been overcome by synthesizing a large number of well defined samples (i) over a range of sizes with the same crystal phase, and (ii) of different crystal phases with the same size using flame aerosol reactors (FLAR). Finally, the relevance and guidelines for analyzing the data from toxicological studies are also presented.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nSimilar to the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 that is not directly proportional to the total surface area but to the availability of active sites (Sclafani and Herrmann 1996), the same is true for ROS activity of TiO2. The discontinuous crystal planes or defects in the crystal structures of nanomaterials play an important role in reactive oxygen species generation; and hence nanoparticle activity is related to the available surface defect sites (Arenz et al. 2005; Rajh et al. 2002). A greater number of defects per unit surface area translates into greater activity. Small TiO2 particles (less than 30 nm in this work) have a lower number of defect sites per unit surface area compared to larger particles of the same crystal phase (Banfield and Zhang 2001). This explains the decrease observed in below 30 nm. These results are consistent with observations from TiO2 surface absorption activity tests. For example, after normalization by total surface area, small sized TiO2 nanoparticles have lower adsorption affinity and capacity for lead (Pb) than larger sized particles (Giammar et al. 2007). Similarly, the adsorption of Cd(II) on anatase TiO2 occurred with lower affinities for smaller sized nanoparticles than for larger particles (Gao et al. 2004). Other materials have also exhibited a size dependent surface defect density. A decrease in surface area normalized adsorption density with decreasing particle size was observed for adsorption of Hg(II) on nanoscale goethite (α-FeOOH) (Waychunas et al. 2005).\n\nFor particles greater than 30 nm in size, the ROS activity per unit surface area was similar for different sized particles (30 - 195 nm, ) as they behave similarly to bulk anatase TiO2 (number of reactive or defect sites per unit surface area is constant). Below 10 nm, the ROS generation per unit surface area is also approximately the same ( ) due to the number of reactive sites being constant per unit surface area. One reason for this could be that particles below 10 nm are synthesized by quenching the particle growth by very rapid dilution (Almquist and Biswas 2002; Jiang et al. 2007). Due to this, the number of reactive sites per unit area may not decrease further with decrease in size but remain approximately constant. The overall low reactivity of particles in the quantum regime can also be attributed to decrease in electron populations at the higher energy bands of titanium dioxide, due to increased separation of energy states.\n\nUsing the understanding that was developed by plotting the results with the ROS normalized by surface area allows a clearer interpretation of the trends with size. This reasoning can then be used to explain the trends in , which is a more commonly adopted way of presenting results in the toxicology literature. Above 30 nm, the reactivity of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles is directly proportional to the total surface area ( ). Similarly, the trends in can also be explained readily. In the range of 30 -195 nm and below 10 nm, the ROS activity is proportional to the surface area. Therefore, the intrinsic ROS activity of particles in the 30-200 nm size range increases with decreasing particle size for a given mass loading, and this non-biological activity is similar to what was reported in previous toxicological studies (Donaldson et al. 2001a; Oberdorster et al. 2005b). The same reasoning holds for anatase TiO2 particles in the size range of 4 - 10 nm, i.e. they had similar ROS activity and smaller particles generated more ROS at a fixed mass loading (due to their larger total surface area).\n\nIn summary, the reactivity depends on the defect site density (number of defects per unit area). The defect site density is approximately constant above 30 nm, decreases between 30 and 10 nm, and then is very low and approximately constant for particles below 10 nm. This variation is a strong function of the synthesis method (Mills and LeHunte 1997), and caution should be exercised in comparing activity of samples prepared by different methodologies and systems. Clear trends could be deciphered in this work due to the large number of available samples that were produced with very strict control of properties. It would also be important to determine whether such an S-shaped dose-response curve would be observed in biological in vitro and in vivo tests.\n\nThe trend in size is consistent for TiO2 particles with other crystal structures (anatase/rutile mixture and amorphous). The oxidant capacity of 60 nm (No. 10) and 27 nm (No. 11) TiO2 nanoparticles, which were 80% anatase and 20% rutile, was measured. Similar to anatase TiO2, smaller anatase/rutile TiO2 particles had lower ROS activity per unit surface area than larger ones (1.19 μmol/m2 vs. 2.43 μmol/m2). For a given mass loading, however, the total surface area increase for 27 nm particles was large enough to overcome the activity decrease so that slightly more reactive oxygen species were produced by 27 nm particles (3.41 μM vs. 3.10 μM). For amorphous TiO2 with different sizes, the trend was similar ( ). 53 nm amorphous particles (No. 22) had a similar ROS activity per unit area as 41 nm amorphous particles (No. 21), and this was much higher than 3 nm amorphous particles (No. 20), as shown in . However, 3 nm particles had a much higher total surface area and subsequently generated more reactive oxygen species under the same mass loading of 50 μg/ml (35.3 μM vs 7.5 μM or 6.2 μM; ).\n\nThe phase composition effect on TiO2 ROS activity also derives from particle structure characteristics, especially surface properties. Amorphous TiO2 has much higher surface defect density compared to anatase and rutile TiO2 since its structure is not periodic (Carp et al. 2004). These defects serve as active sites and generate ROS. Therefore, in the similar size range, amorphous TiO2 particles have a higher intrinsic oxidant capacity compared to crystalline TiO2 particles. The observation that anatase TiO2 has higher ROS activity than rutile TiO2 is consistent with the results of other activity tests. It has been reported that anatase is more photocatalytically active than rutile (Carp et al. 2004; Sclafani and Herrmann 1996). The lead (Pb) absorption affinity and capacities of anatase were demonstrated to be higher than that of rutile (Giammar et al. 2007). Samples of the mixed phase materials fell in between these two extremes in ROS activity, catalytic activity and adsorption activity. Similar results were also reported by Sayes and coworkers (Sayes et al. 2006) in cytotoxicity tests using TiO2 nanoparticles with different crystal structures, although the sizes of their TiO2 samples were not the same. The higher activity of anatase with respect to that of rutile could be explained by their surface chemistry difference, i.e. the higher aptitude of anatase to adsorb oxygen in the form of O2- and O- (Sclafani and Herrmann 1996) and the dissociative adsorption of water molecules to anatase faces (i.e. as H+ and OH-) against the nondissociative water adsorption to rutile faces (i.e. as H2O) (Selloni et al. 1998; Vittadini et al. 1998). Oxygen in the form of O2-, O- and dissociated water molecules on the anatase crystal faces facilitate the ROS formation (Sclafani and Herrmann 1996).\n\nThough only chemical activity was measured in this study, this is very relevant to toxicological studies. The intrinsic non-biological oxidant capacity could be used as a pre-screening strategy to predict nanoparticle toxic potential. However, the validity of this suggestion needs to be determined in subsequent toxicity tests using a range of particle sizes (<10 nm to >30 nm) with well defined crystal structure in cell and animal studies, which is the subject of future studies in our group. Importantly, nanoparticle-cell interactions – in vitro or in vivo – will also result in cell activation, with additional ROS production by different cellular mechanisms (Donaldson et al. 2006; Nel et al. 2006; Oberdorster et al. 2007) that are likely to be dependent upon particle surface properties and intracellular targets. The method of presenting the data proposed in this paper allows an evaluation of the true effects of parameters such as size. For example, to study the effect of size, it is suggested that the biological signal (such as inflammation, gene and protein expression, oxidative stress, or other) is presented per unit surface area for the different sizes. Additional ROS production by cells mentioned above as well as possibly differences between BET surface area and bio-available surface area have to be considered when interpreting in vitro and in vivo results. Thus, agglomeration of particles could be one important factor. All the particles used in this study tended to agglomerate to different degrees in solution (the hydrodynamic sizes of 10 nm and 50 nm particles in deionized water were 140 nm and 525 nm, respectively). While not important in establishing chemical activity relationships as the surface of the particle is still available, it may be an important factor that would influence the results of the in vivo or in vitro studies."
