The Sydney Royal Easter Show (SRES; Sydney Olympic Park, New South Wales, Australia) is an annual, 14-day, agricultural mass-gathering event occurring around the Easter weekend, attracting more than 800,000 patrons per year. In this study, patient records from the SRES were analyzed to examine relationships between weather, crowd size, day of week, and demographics on treatment and disposition. This information would help to predict factors affecting patient treatment and disposition to guide ongoing training of first responders and to evaluate the appropriateness of staffing skills mix at future events. Hypothesis Patient demographics, environmental factors, and attendance would influence the nature and severity of presentations at the SRES, which would influence staffing requirements. A retrospective analysis of 4,141 patient record forms was performed for patients who presented to St John Ambulance (Australian Capital Territory, Australia) at the SRES between 2012 and 2014 inclusive. Presentation type was classified using a previously published minimum data set. Data on weather and crowd size were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and the SRES, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v22 (IBM; Armonk, New York USA). Between 2012 to 2014, over 2.5 million people attended the SRES with 4,141 patients treated onsite. As expected, the majority of presentations were injuries (49%) and illnesses (46%). Although patient demographics and presentation types did not change over time, the duration of treatment increased. A higher proportion of patients were discharged to hospital or home compared to the proportion of patients discharged back to the event. Patients from rural/regional locations (accounting for 15% of all patients) were\n\nImportance Performance Analysis as a Trade Show Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking Tool\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTafesse, Wondwesen; Skallerud, KÃ¥re; Korneliussen, Tor\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAuthor's accepted version (post-print). The purpose of this study is to introduce importance performance analysis as a trade show performance evaluation and benchmarking tool. Importance performance analysis considers exhibitorsâ performance expectation and perceived performance in unison to evaluate and benchmark trade show performance. The present study uses data obtained from exhibitors of an international trade show to demonstrate how importance performance analysis can be used to eval...\n\nPerforating pilomatrixoma showing atypical presentation: A rare clinical variant\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNevra Seyhan\n\n2018-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Pilomatrixoma, also known as calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, is a rare benign skin tumor arising from hair follicle stem cells. The most common localization is the head and neck region. Female/male ratio is 3/2. It shows deep subcutaneous placement and occurs in the first two decades of life. Its diameter ranges from 0.5 cm to 3 cm. Multiple lesions are rarely seen. Histopathologically it is characterized by basoloid and ghost cells. Perforating type is a rare clinical variant. Treatment is surgical excision. Our case is presented to draw attention to a rare clinical variant of pilomatrixioma.\n\nFat stigmatization in television shows and movies: a content analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHimes, Susan M; Thompson, J Kevin\n\n2007-03-01\n\nTo examine the phenomenon of fat stigmatization messages presented in television shows and movies, a content analysis was used to quantify and categorize fat-specific commentary and humor. Fat stigmatization vignettes were identified using a targeted sampling procedure, and 135 scenes were excised from movies and television shows. The material was coded by trained raters. Reliability indices were uniformly high for the seven categories (percentage agreement ranged from 0.90 to 0.98; kappas ranged from 0.66 to 0.94). Results indicated that fat stigmatization commentary and fat humor were often verbal, directed toward another person, and often presented directly in the presence of the overweight target. Results also indicated that male characters were three times more likely to engage in fat stigmatization commentary or fat humor than female characters. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first information regarding the specific gender, age, and types of fat stigmatization that occur frequently in movies and television shows. The stimuli should prove useful in future research examining the role of individual difference factors (e.g., BMI) in the reaction to viewing such vignettes.\n\nCost-volume-profit and net present value analysis of health information systems.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcLean, R A\n\n1998-08-01\n\nThe adoption of any information system should be justified by an economic analysis demonstrating that its projected benefits outweigh its projected costs. Analysis differ, however, on which methods to employ for such a justification. Accountants prefer cost-volume-profit analysis, and economists prefer net present value analysis. The article explains the strengths and weaknesses of each method and shows how they can be used together so that well-informed investments in information systems can be made.\n\nThe Presentation of Science in Everyday Life: The Science Show\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWatermeyer, Richard\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper constitutes a case-study of the \"science show\" model of public engagement employed by a company of science communicators focused on the popularization of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subject disciplines with learner constituencies.

It is of great importance that more and more young people get in touch with the works of art that make the material cultural heritage. However, the traditional ways of presentation are usually not very popular with the audience, since people are so used to the dynamics of the new media. Contemporary exhibitions are becoming a way for the audience to get information, entertainment and education, since they tell stories and offer arguments of diversity and importance of cultural heritage. In this paper we will analyze the advantages of technology in presentation and promotion of cultural heritage on the example of the multimedia exhibition âRefreshing of memoryâ. Through animation, projection and interactive presentation, intriguing lighting and sound sensations, the author of the exhibition Ivan Mangov has presented the medieval painting to the younger audience.\n\nQuantitative possibility analysis. Present status in ESCA\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrion, D.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nA short review of the recent developments in quantification of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy or ESCA is presented. The basic equations are reminded. Each involved parameter (photoionisation, inelastic mean free paths, 'response function' of the instruments, intensity measurement) is separately discussed in relation with the accuracy and the precision of the method. Other topics are considered such as roughness, surface contamination, matrix effect and inhomogeneous composition. Some aspects of the quantitative ESCA analysis and AES analysis are compared [fr\n\nPresent and future position of neutron activation analysis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nde Bruin, M.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nResults are presented of the performance of INAA and RNAA and when compared with other spectrometric methods for trace element analysis.

Attention is paid to the available irradiation facilities, in particular nuclear reactors, cyclotrons and Van de Graaff accelerators, and linear electron accelerators. Mention is made of progress in fundamental fields, but the attention is especially focussed on practical applications: environmental, geochemical/cosmochemical, biological/medical, and high-purity materials. Eventually, the role of activation analysis in research projects of the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) and in the Reference Materials program of the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) is emphasized\n\nPresentations of the GeoExchange 2005 international conference and trade show\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRoss, L. (comp.) [GeoExchange BC, Burnaby, BC (Canada)\n\n2005-07-01\n\nThis international conference provided a forum to discuss the status of geoexchange technology and industry. Advances in geoexchange system innovations have provided a sustainable option for space heating, cooling and hot water heating for buildings at typically less than 50 per cent of the cost of conventional gas and electric heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Major constraints on North American gas production were reviewed to provide a strong case for a sustainable geoexchange industry. Geoexchange systems offer the largest greenhouse gas mitigation opportunity worldwide. In addition to lasting for years, they require minimum maintenance. The unique environment of the Pacific West Coast provides the geoexchange industry with new opportunities to promote a sustainable energy plan for the 2010 Winter Olympics Athletes Village. Some presentations outlined professional design guidelines for evaluating geoexchange proposals, conducting site evaluations and completing proper designs for successful installations. Program developers from CANMET Energy Technology Centre presented the latest version of the RETScreen Ground Source Heat Pump Project model for evaluating the design of geoexchange proposals. An overview of the new refrigeration action program for buildings was also presented. The conference featured 32 presentations in various sessions that focused on system performance, monitoring and innovations in design and technology; issues associated with geoexchange and aquifer/open loop system characteristics, performance and design; earth heat fundamentals, HVAC designs and LEED points; market potential for geoexchange and financial considerations; innovative deployment of geoexchange systems and technology; deep sea and wastewater design applications for geoexchange technology; case studies of innovations in design for commercial and institutional geoexchange system installations; and, the business potential for geoexchange. tabs., figs.\n\nSimplified life-cycle analysis of PV systems in buildings: present situation and future trends\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFrankl, P.; Masini, A.; Gamberale, M.; Toccaceli, D.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in buildings shows several advantages compared to conventional PV power plants. The main objectives of the present study are the quantitative evaluation of the benefits of building-integrated PV systems over their entire life-cycle and the identification of best solutions to maximise their energy efficiency and CO 2 mitigation potential. In order to achieve these objectives, a simplified life-cycle analysis (LCA) has been carried out. Firstly, a number of existing applications have been studied. Secondly, a parametric analysis of possible improvements in the balance-of-system (BOS) has been developed. Finally, the two steps have been combined with the analysis of crystalline silicon technologies. Results are reported in terms of several indicators: energy pay-back time, CO 2 yield and specific CO 2 emissions. The Indicators show that the integration of PV systems in buildings clearly increases the environmental benefits of present PV technology. These benefits will further increase with future PV technologies. Future optimised PV roof-integrated systems are expected to have an energy pay-back time of around 1-5 years (1 year with heat recovery) and to save during their lifetime more than 20 times the amount of CO 2 emitted during their manufacturing (34 times with heat recovery).

The costs and benefits of a construction project are often involved with uncertainty and it is not possible to find a precise value for a particular project. In this paper, we present a simple method to calculate the net present value of a cash flow when both costs and benefits are given as triangular numbers. The proposed model of this paper uses Delphi method to figure out the fair values of all costs and revenues and then using fizzy programming techniques, it calculates the fuzzy net present value. The implementation of the proposed model is demonstrated using a simple example.\n\nEDF analysis of hydrogen problem on present NPPs\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGuieu, S.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nBy letter dated March 1995, Electricite de France (EDF) has sent to the French Safety Authority (called DSIN, depending jointly from Industry and Environment Ministries) its position, for Present NPPs, regarding three main topics concerning severe accidents pointed by DSIN: hydrogen problem; high pressure core melt risk; and instrumentation. Concerning 'hydrogen problem', EDF answer is not only a state-of-the art analysis but intend to answer the question of the need (or not) for implementation of countermeasures in Present French NPPs. This position is presently under review by DSIN and its Technical Supports.

In recent years researchers recognized the usefulness of keyword network analysis for visualizing and analyzing scientific research topics. Therefore, we applied keyword network analysis to present an overview of current epidemiologic research topics in Germany. Accepted submissions to the 9th annual congress of the German Society for Epidemiology (DGEpi) in 2014 were used as data source. Submitters had to choose one of 19 subject areas, and were ask to provide a title, structured abstract, names of authors along with their affiliations, and a list of freely selectable keywords. Keywords had been provided for 262 (82Â %) submissions, 1030 keywords in total. Overall the most common keywords were: \"migration\" (18 times), \"prevention\" (15 times), followed by \"children\", \"cohort study\", \"physical activity\", and \"secondary data analysis\" (11 times each). Some keywords showed a certain concentration under one specific subject area, e.g. \"migration\" with 8 of 18 in social epidemiology or \"breast cancer\" with 4 of 7 in cancer epidemiology. While others like \"physical activity\" were equally distributed over multiple subject areas (cardiovascular & metabolic diseases, ageing, methods, paediatrics, prevention & health service research). This keyword network analysis demonstrated the high diversity of epidemiologic research topics with a large number of distinct keywords as presented at the annual conference of the DGEpi.\n\nSocial network analysis: Presenting an underused method for nursing research.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nParnell, James Michael; Robinson, Jennifer C\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThis paper introduces social network analysis as a versatile method with many applications in nursing research. Social networks have been studied for years in many social science fields. The methods continue to advance but remain unknown to most nursing scholars. Discussion paper. English language and interpreted literature was searched from Ovid Healthstar, CINAHL, PubMed Central, Scopus and hard copy texts from 1965 - 2017. Social network analysis first emerged in nursing literature in 1995 and appears minimally through present day. To convey the versatility and applicability of social network analysis in nursing, hypothetical scenarios are presented. The scenarios are illustrative of three approaches to social network analysis and include key elements of social network research design. The methods of social network analysis are underused in nursing research, primarily because they are unknown to most scholars. However, there is methodological flexibility and epistemological versatility capable of supporting quantitative and qualitative research. The analytic techniques of social network analysis can add new insight into many areas of nursing inquiry, especially those influenced by cultural norms. Furthermore, visualization techniques associated with social network analysis can be used to generate new hypotheses. Social network analysis can potentially uncover findings not accessible through methods commonly used in nursing research. Social networks can be analysed based on individual-level attributes, whole networks and subgroups within networks. Computations derived from social network analysis may stand alone to answer a research question or incorporated as variables into robust statistical models.

D. H.; Zhong, Q. C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUsing Laplace transforms we extend the economic production quantity (EPQ) model by analysing cash flows from a net present value (NPV) viewpoint. We obtain an exact expression for the present value of the cash flows in the EPQ problem. From this, we are able to derive the optimal batch size. We obtain insights into the monotonicity and convexity of the present value of each of the cash flows, and show that there is a unique minimum in the present value of the sum of the cash flows in the exte...\n\nPresent state and future of CFD based on three-dimensional RANS analysis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKim, Kwang Yong\n\n2004-01-01\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based on Navier-Stokes equations has been developed rapidly for several decades with the developments of high speed computers and numerical algorithms, and presently is regarded as an essential analysis tool in the engineering applications containing fluid flow and convective heat transfer. It is known that for turbulent flow the Navier-Stokes equations can be calculated precisely by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). However, DNS needs huge computing time even for simple low-Reynolds number flows, and thus is not practical. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) can be an alternative. But, LES also needs considerable computing time for the analysis of engineering flows, and have some problem in the methods. Therefore, the analysis methods using Reynolds-averaged Navier-stokes equations (RANS) and turbulence closure models are still regarded as the major techniques for the analysis of turbulent flows in spite of the inaccuracy of the prediction. In this presentation, the present state and the prospect of CFD based on three-dimensional RANS analysis are introduced for physical models and numerical algorithms with the engineering examples. Especially, for the analysis of two-phase flows in nuclear reactor, the recently developed techniques are also introduced. And, the presentation includes the methods of design optimization using RANS analysis and numerical optimization techniques with variety of the applications\n\nReal-time data analysis at the LHC: present and future\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGligorov, V.V.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which collides protons at an energy of 14 TeV, produces hundreds of exabytes of data per year, making it one of the largest sources of data in the world today. At present it is not possible to even transfer most of this data from the four main particle detectors at the LHC to \"offline\" data facilities, much less to permanently store it for future processing. For this reason the LHC detectors are equipped with real-time analysis systems, called triggers, which process this volume of data and select the most interesting proton-proton collisions. The LHC experiment triggers reduce the data produced by the LHC by between 1/1000 and 1/100000, to tens of petabytes per year, allowing its economical storage and further analysis. The bulk of the data-reduction is performed by custom electronics which ignores most of the data in its decision making, and is therefore unable to exploit the most powerful known data analysis strategies. I cover the present status of real-time data analysis ...\n\nA Short Integrated Presentation of Valuation, Profitability and Growth Analysis\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPettersson, Kim; SÃ¸rensen, Ole\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe demonstrate how the valuation models used in finance theory and the profitability and growth analysis taught in financial statement analysis are related. Traditional textbooks on finance and financial statement analysis are often very comprehensive, comprising a vast number of chapters. However......, the learning cost associated to this seems to be that many students are unable to understand either the interrelations between the chapters in a financial statement analysis textbook, or the origins of financial information (i.e., financial statements) in applied finance. Thus, the underlying motivation...... of this teaching note is to highlight the purpose of profitability and growth analysis in financial statement analysis by incorporating the point of value relevance in applied finance. We hope this reduced presentation of valuation and profitability and growth analysis will help students to understand...\n\nThe Last Gender Picture Show to Closure Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSven Grampp\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available This work presents in (and especially on one detail what it means to practice gender analysis as formal image analysis in the context of television shows. The chosen example for that is the closing scene of âBuffy the Vampire Slayerâ (USA 1997-2003. This television show engages in a highly self-reflexive manner with common pop cultural representations of gender, which becomes particularly prevalent and radically condensed in the series finale.\n\nCollection Analysis: Powerful Ways To Collect, Analyze, and Present Your Data.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHart, Amy\n\n2003-01-01\n\nDiscussion of collection analysis in school libraries focuses on the kinds of data used and how to use library automation software to collect the data.

(LRW)\n\nHigh school students presenting science: An interactional sociolinguistic analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBleicher, Robert\n\nPresenting science is an authentic activity of practicing scientists. Thus, effective communication of science is an important skill to nurture in high school students who are learning science. This study examines strategies employed by high school students as they make science presentations; it assesses students' conceptual understandings of particular science topics through their presentations and investigates gender differences. Data are derived from science presentation given by eight high school students, three females and five males who attended a summer science program. Data sources included videotaped presentations, ethnographic fieldnotes, interviews with presenters and members of the audience, and presenter notes and overheads. Presentations were transcribed and submitted to discourse analysis from an interactional sociolinguistic perspective. This article focuses on the methodology employed and how it helps inform the above research questions. The author argues that use of this methodology leads to findings that inform important social-communicative issues in the learning of science. Practical advice for teaching students to present science, implications for use of presentations to assess conceptual learning, and indications of some possible gender differences are discussed.Received: 14 April 1993; Revised: 15 February 1994;\n\nAnalysis and presentation of experimental results with examples, problems and programs\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nChristodoulides, Costas\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis book is intended as a guide to the analysis and presentation of experimental results. It develops various techniques for the numerical processing of experimental data, using basic statistical methods and the theory of errors. After presenting basic theoretical concepts, the book describes the methods by which the results can be presented, both numerically and graphically. The book is divided into three parts, of roughly equal length, addressing the theory, the analysis of data, and the presentation of results. Examples are given and problems are solved using the Excel, Origin, Python and R software packages. In addition, programs in all four languages are made available to readers, allowing them to use them in analyzing and presenting the results of their own experiments. Subjects are treated at a level appropriate for undergraduate students in the natural sciences, but this book should also appeal to anyone whose work involves dealing with experimental results.\n\nSafety analysis of the present status of the research reactor 'RA' at 'Vinca' Institute\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJovic, V.; Jovic, L.; Zivotic, Z.; Milovanovic, Dj.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nSafety analysis of the nuclear facility which has been out of work for a long time and whose future is not defined at the present moment, can not be connected to the usual, normatively regulated system analysis procedure in both operational and accidental regimes. Therefore, the safety analysis of the present status of the present status of the reactor RA is related to system and components analysis which, in present conditions maintain their nuclear functions operational. In the first place, it refers to components and equipment in which radioactive radiation generation still exists and to installations and equipment maintaining radiation level below permitted limit. in the context of the analysis the following areas are being covered: present status characteristics, accidental events while operating period from 1959. to 1984., nuclear fuels and radioactive waste inventory, basic characteristics and status of safety-related systems and equipment, radiation protection, potential accident analysis at present status of the reactor RA, potential accidental situations due to natural events (earthquakes, water flood) or man-induced events and security. 8 refs\n\nTomato Fruits Show Wide Phenomic Diversity but Fruit Developmental Genes Show Low Genomic Diversity.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVijee Mohan\n\nFull Text Available Domestication of tomato has resulted in large diversity in fruit phenotypes. An intensive phenotyping of 127 tomato accessions from 20 countries revealed extensive morphological diversity in fruit traits. The diversity in fruit traits clustered the accessions into nine classes and identified certain promising lines having desirable traits pertaining to total soluble salts (TSS, carotenoids, ripening index, weight and shape. Factor analysis of the morphometric data from Tomato Analyzer showed that the fruit shape is a complex trait shared by several factors. The 100% variance between round and flat fruit shapes was explained by one discriminant function having a canonical correlation of 0.874 by stepwise discriminant analysis. A set of 10 genes (ACS2, COP1, CYC-B, RIN, MSH2, NAC-NOR, PHOT1, PHYA, PHYB and PSY1 involved in various plant developmental processes were screened for SNP polymorphism by EcoTILLING. The genetic diversity in these genes revealed a total of 36 non-synonymous and 18 synonymous changes leading to the identification of 28 haplotypes. The average frequency of polymorphism across the genes was 0.038/Kb. Significant negative Tajima'D statistic in two of the genes, ACS2 and PHOT1 indicated the presence of rare alleles in low frequency. Our study indicates that while there is low polymorphic diversity in the genes regulating plant development, the population shows wider phenotype diversity. Nonetheless, morphological and genetic diversity of the present collection can be further exploited as potential resources in future.\n\nOperational present status and reliability analysis of the upgraded EAST cryogenic system\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhou, Z. W.; Y Zhang, Q.; Lu, X. F.; Hu, L. B.; Zhu, P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSince the first commissioning in 2005, the cryogenic system for EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) has been cooled down and warmed up for thirteen experimental campaigns. In order to promote the refrigeration efficiencies and reliability, the EAST cryogenic system was upgraded gradually with new helium screw compressors and new dynamic gas bearing helium turbine expanders with eddy current brake to improve the original poor mechanical and operational performance from 2012 to 2015. Then the totally upgraded cryogenic system was put into operation in the eleventh cool-down experiment, and has been operated for the latest several experimental campaigns. The upgraded system has successfully coped with various normal operational modes during cool-down and 4.5 K steady-state operation under pulsed heat load from the tokamak as well as the abnormal fault modes including turbines protection stop. In this paper, the upgraded EAST cryogenic system including its functional analysis and new cryogenic control networks will be presented in detail. Also, its operational present status in the latest cool-down experiments will be presented and the system reliability will be analyzed, which shows a high reliability and low fault rate after upgrade. In the end, some future necessary work to meet the higher reliability requirement for future uninterrupted long-term experimental operation will also be proposed.\n\nData Analysis for ARRA Early Fuel Cell Market Demonstrations (Presentation)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKurtz, J.; Wipke, K.; Sprik, S.; Ramsden, T.\n\n2010-05-01\n\nPresentation about ARRA Early Fuel Cell Market Demonstrations, including an overview of the ARRE Fuel Cell Project, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's data analysis objectives, deployment composite data products, and planned analyses.\n\nCharged particle activation analysis: present status and future perspectives\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChowdhury, D.P.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nCharged particle activation analysis is a highly sensitive nuclear analytical technique for the determination of elements at trace and ultra trace levels.

The research was conducted by interviewing respondents. Comparative analysis was used in order to formulate proposal of factors which determine information accuracy in the credit bureau reports. The results show that the materially significant errors in information presented in Serbian credit bureau reports make 0.5% of the sample. This implies that creditors in Serbia base their credit decisions on reliable information. The results of this study were compared to results of the studies conducted in USA and Germany in order to formulate proposal of factors which influence the information accuracy in the credit bureau reports. In order toimprove information accuracy in credit bureau reports, in global terms, special attention should be paid to formulation of international standards of credit reporting and identification systems of natural persons and legal entities.\n\nAfrican Primary Care Research: Quantitative analysis and presentation of results\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOgunbanjo, Gboyega A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract This article is part of a series on Primary Care Research Methods.

The main characteristic of issue-centered talk shows being the destabilization of the implicit rules and participation framework, we observe how the so-called democratic right to express ourselves is (misused by the talk show host to secure the dynamics of the show. In order to reveal the host's manipulations, we have examined the verbal interactions between host and guests on the following issues: topic choice, turn-taking mechanisms and identity construction of the talk show's guests. In the perspective that this kind of talk show presents itself as a public space where direct democracy can be exercised, the analysis of the discursive strategies of the talk show host reveals the impact of a mediatic participation framework.Para a presente anÃ¡lise escolhemos um \"talk show\" francÃªs recente para ilustrar como a comunicaÃ§Ã£o se transforma em um novo tipo de ideologia: em outras palavras, vocÃª deve se comunicar se vocÃª se considera um cidadÃ£o do mundo de hoje. Sendo a principal caracterÃ­stica do talk show a desestabilizaÃ§Ã£o das regras implÃ­citas e o framework de participaÃ§Ã£o, observamos como o tal direito democrÃ¡tico de expressÃ£o Ã© interpretado pelo apresentador para manter a dinÃ¢mica do programa. Para revelar suas manipulaÃ§Ãµes, examinamos as interaÃ§Ãµes verbais entre apresentador e convidados nos seguintes temas: escolha do tÃ³pico, mecanismos de tomada de turno e construÃ§Ã£o de identidade dos convidados. Ã nessa perspectiva que este tipo de programa se apresenta como um espaÃ§o pÃºblico onde a democracia direta pode ser exercitada; a anÃ¡lise das estratÃ©gias discursivas do apresentador do talk show revela o impacto de um framework de participaÃ§Ã£o mediada.\n\nDioscorea alata tuber proteome analysis shows over thirty dioscorin isoforms and novel tuber proteins.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSharma, Shruti; Gupta, Ravi; Deswal, Renu\n\n2017-05-01\n\nIn Dioscorea, dioscorin (31Â kDa) is the major storage protein constituting 85% of the total tuber proteins. An integrated proteomic and biochemical approach was used to understand the physiological role of dioscorin in the two contrasting growth stages (germinating and mature tuber). HPLC analysis showed 3 fold reduction in mannitol and 12.88 and 1.24 fold increase in sucrose and maltose in the germinating tuber. A 1.8 and 3 fold increase in sucrose phosphate synthase and mannitol dehydrogenase activity respectively was observed in the germinating tuber while a 2 fold higher invertase probably lowers the sucrose accumulation in the mature tuber. SDS-PAGE and 2-D maps of the mature and germinating tubers confirmed depletion (more than 50%) of dioscorin on germination. Dioscorin was purified using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography with 43.32 fold purification and 38.16 yield. Out of a trail of 35 spots at 31Â kDa only 12 spots (identified as dioscorin isoforms) were present in the 2D gel of the purified fraction. To search for other tuber proteins besides dioscorin, the unbound fractions of DEAE column were analysed by 2DGE. DREB 1A, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase and Rab-1 small GTP binding protein were identified perhaps for the first time in the Dioscorea proteome. The interactome analysis revealed these to be involved in oxidative stress, carotenoid synthesis and vesicular transport. This is perhaps the first attempt to identify tuber proteome (although limited) and to understand the physiological significance of these proteins. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Measuring at a rate of 250 Hz, ATSA is capable or obtaining the cardiac waveform in blood flow data, referred to as the Speckle-Plethysmogram (SPG). ATSA is also capable of simultaneously measuring the Photoplethysmogram (PPG), a more conventional signal related to light intensity. In this work we present several novel algorithms for extracting physiologically relevant information from the combined SPG-PPG waveform data. First we show that there is a slight time-delay between the SPG and PPG that can be extracted computationally. Second, we present a set of frequency domain algorithms that measure harmonic content on pulse-by-pulse basis for both the SPG and PPG. Finally, we apply these algorithms to data obtained from a set of subjects including healthy controls and individuals with heightened cardiovascular risk. We hypothesize that the time-delay and frequency content are correlated with cardiovascular health; specifically with vascular stiffening.\n\nInfrared imaging spectroscopy and chemometric tools for in situ analysis of an imiquimod pharmaceutical preparation presented as cream\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCarneiro, Renato Lajarim; Poppi, Ronei Jesus\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn the present work the homogeneity of a pharmaceutical formulation presented as a cream was studied using infrared imaging spectroscopy and chemometric methodologies such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). A cream formulation, presented as an emulsion, was prepared using imiquimod as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and the excipients: water, vaseline, an emulsifier and a carboxylic acid in order to dissolve the API. After exposure at 45 Â°C during 3 months to perform accelerated stability test, the presence of some crystals was observed, indicating homogeneity problems in the formulation. PCA exploratory analysis showed that the crystal composition was different from the composition of the emulsion, since the score maps presented crystal structures in the emulsion. MCR-ALS estimated the spectra of the crystals and the emulsion. The crystals presented amine and C-H bands, suggesting that the precipitate was a salt formed by carboxylic acid and imiquimod. These results indicate the potential of infrared imaging spectroscopy in conjunction with chemometric methodologies as an analytical tool to ensure the quality of cream formulations in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nRe-presentations of space in Hollywood movies: an event-indexing analysis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCutting, James; Iricinschi, Catalina\n\n2015-03-01\n\nPopular movies present chunk-like events (scenes and subscenes) that promote episodic, serial updating of viewers' representations of the ongoing narrative. Event-indexing theory would suggest that the beginnings of new scenes trigger these updates, which in turn require more cognitive processing. Typically, a new movie event is signaled by an establishing shot, one providing more background information and a longer look than the average shot. Our analysis of 24 films reconfirms this. More important, we show that, when returning to a previously shown location, the re-establishing shot reduces both context and duration while remaining greater than the average shot. In general, location shifts dominate character and time shifts in event segmentation of movies. In addition, over the last 70Â years re-establishing shots have become more like the noninitial shots of a scene. Establishing shots have also approached noninitial shot scales, but not their durations. Such results suggest that film form is evolving, perhaps to suit more rapid encoding of narrative events.

G.; Shah, F.; Rehman, R. N.; Haq, M. E.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA 28 years old female presented with headache, fever, altered sensorium and right side weakness for one week. She was febrile and drowsy with right sided hemiplegia and papilledema. Tuberculous or bacterial meningitis, tuberculoma and abscess were at the top of the diagnosis list followed by Herpes simplex meningo-encephalitis (HSE). MRI showed abnormal signal intensity of left temporal lobe without significant post-contrast enhancement and midline shift. CSF examination was normal, gram stain and Ziehl-Neelsen stain showed no micro-organism, or acid fast bacilli. CSF for MTB PCR was negative. PCR DNA for Herpes simplex 1 on CSF was detected. Acyclovir was started and the patient was discharged after full recovery. A high index of suspicion is required for HSE diagnosis in Pakistan where other infections predominantly affect the brain and HSE may be overlooked as a potential diagnosis.

The application of dental anatomy in clinical practice is important, and dentist should have a thorough knowledge regarding the morphology of the teeth. At times as a result of genetic variation, environmental factors, diet of an individual and race, variations in the morphology of the teeth can be observed. These variations have been extensively studied by the researcher in the field of anthropology to define a particular race. The most commonly observed changes include peg-shaped laterals, shovel-shaped incisors, and extra cusp on molar. Common variations documented with regard to maxillary and mandibular first premolars are the variation in the number of roots. But the variations with respect to crown morphology are few. We report a first documented unusual presentation of maxillary and mandibular first premolars with three-cusps pattern in a female patient.\n\nUrine proteome analysis in Dent's disease shows high selective changes potentially involved in chronic renal damage.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSantucci, Laura; Candiano, Giovanni; Anglani, Franca; Bruschi, Maurizio; Tosetto, Enrica; Cremasco, Daniela; Murer, Luisa; D'Ambrosio, Chiara; Scaloni, Andrea; Petretto, Andrea; Caridi, Gianluca; Rossi, Roberta; Bonanni, Alice; Ghiggeri, Gian Marco\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDefinition of the urinary protein composition would represent a potential tool for diagnosis in many clinical conditions. The use of new proteomic technologies allows detection of genetic and post-trasductional variants that increase sensitivity of the approach but complicates comparison within a heterogeneous patient population. Overall, this limits research of urinary biomarkers. Studying monogenic diseases are useful models to address this issue since genetic variability is reduced among first- and second-degree relatives of the same family. We applied this concept to Dent's disease, a monogenic condition characterised by low-molecular-weight proteinuria that is inherited following an X-linked trait. Results are presented here on a combined proteomic approach (LC-mass spectrometry, Western blot and zymograms for proteases and inhibitors) to characterise urine proteins in a large family (18 members, 6 hemizygous patients, 6 carrier females, and 6 normals) with Dent's diseases due to the 1070G>T mutation of the CLCN5. Gene ontology analysis on more than 1000 proteins showed that several clusters of proteins characterised urine of affected patients compared to carrier females and normal subjects: proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodelling were the major group. Specific analysis on metalloproteases and their inhibitors underscored unexpected mechanisms potentially involved in renal fibrosis. Studying with new-generation techniques for proteomic analysis of the members of a large family with Dent's disease sharing the same molecular defect allowed highly repetitive results that justify conclusions. Identification in urine of proteins actively involved in interstitial matrix remodelling poses the question of active anti-fibrotic drugs in Dent's patients. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Three studies reported here document psychological causes of their flaws. In Study 1 we found that eight psychological principles are often violated in PowerPointÂ® presentations, across different fieldsâfor example, academic research presentations generally were no better or worse than business presentations. In Study 2 we found that respondents reported having noticed, and having been annoyed by, specific problems in presentations arising from violations of particular psychological principles. Finally, in Study 3 we showed that observers are not highly accurate in recognizing when slides violated a specific psychological rule. Furthermore, even when they correctly identified the violation, they often could not explain the nature of the problem. In sum, the psychological foundations for effective slideshow presentation design are neither obvious nor necessarily intuitive, and presentation designers in all fields, from education to business to government, could benefit from explicit instruction in relevant aspects of psychology.\n\nProteome Analysis of the Plant Pathogenic Fungus Monilinia laxa Showing Host Specificity\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOlja Bregar\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Brown rot fungus Monilinia laxa (Aderh. & Ruhl. Honey is an important plant pathogen in stone and pome fruits in Europe. We applied a proteomic approach in a study of M. laxa isolates obtained from apples and apricots in order to show the host specifity of the isolates and to analyse differentially expressed proteins in terms of host specifity, fungal pathogenicity and identification of candidate proteins for diagnostic marker development. Extracted mycelium proteins were separated by 2-D electrophoresis (2-DE and visualized by Coomassie staining in a non-linear pH range of 3â11 and Mr of 14â116 kDa. We set up a 2-DE reference map of M. laxa, resolving up to 800 protein spots, and used it for image analysis. The average technical coefficient of variance (13 % demonstrated a high reproducibility of protein extraction and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE PAGE, and the average biological coefficient of variance (23 % enabled differential proteomic analysis of the isolates. Multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis discriminated isolates from two different hosts, providing new data that support the existence of a M. laxa specialized form f. sp. mali, which infects only apples. A total of 50 differentially expressed proteins were further analyzed by LC-MS/MS, yielding 41 positive identifications. The identified mycelial proteins were functionally classified into 6 groups: amino acid and protein metabolism, energy production, carbohydrate metabolism, stress response, fatty acid metabolism and other proteins. Some proteins expressed only in apple isolates have been described as virulence factors in other fungi. The acetolactate synthase was almost 11-fold more abundant in apple-specific isolates than in apricot isolates and it might be implicated in M. laxa host specificity. Ten proteins identified only in apple isolates are potential candidates for the development of M. laxa host-specific diagnostic markers.\n\nPreliminary Evaluation of Outcomes of Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy for Armed Forces Veterans presenting with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDavid Harford\n\n2013-07-01\n\nFull Text Available This brief outline presents some initial findings from a pilot project conducted within a charity settingin the UK, examining clinical outcomes for a cohort of armed forces veterans presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD.

As a part of an Early Career Laboratory Directed Research and Development project, a systems analysis of past, present, and future chemical terrorism scenarios was performed to understand how the chemical threats and attack strategies change over time. For the analysis, the difficulty in executing chemical attack was evaluated within a framework of three major scenario elements. First, historical examples of chemical terrorism were examined to determine how the use of chemical threats, versus other weapons, contributed to the successful execution of the attack. Using the same framework, the future of chemical terrorism was assessed with respect to the impact of globalization and new technologies. Finally, the efficacy of the current defenses against contemporary chemical terrorism was considered briefly. The results of this analysis justify the need for continued diligence in chemical defense.\n\nDetermination of some elements present in black pepper by thermal neutron activation analysis.

Gerdt\n\n1997-12-01\n\nFull Text Available We consider the following problem: what is the most general Lie algebra satisfying a given set of Lie polynomial equations? The presentation of Lie algebras by a finite set of generators and defining relations is one of the most general mathematical and algorithmic schemes of their analysis. That problem is of great practical importance, covering applications ranging from mathematical physics to combinatorial algebra. Some particular applications are constructionof prolongation algebras in the Wahlquist-Estabrook method for integrability analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations and investigation of Lie algebras arising in different physical models. The finite presentations also indicate a way to q-quantize Lie algebras. To solve this problem, one should perform a large volume of algebraic transformations which is sharply increased with growth of the number of generators and relations. For this reason, in practice one needs to use a computer algebra tool. We describe here an algorithm for constructing the basis of a finitely presented Lie algebra and its commutator table, and its implementation in the C language. Some computer results illustrating our algorithmand its actual implementation are also presented.\n\nTokyo Motor Show 2003; Tokyo Motor Show 2003\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nJoly, E.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe text which follows present the different techniques exposed during the 37.

We demonstrate our technique on both a `bulk-optics' free-space system and a compact device. Using the compact device, which is capable of recording both Raman and fluorescence signals, we achieved an average sensitivity and specificity of 98.4% and 99.6% for discrimination, respectively. Our approach demonstrates that both Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy can be used for portable discrimination of EVOOs which obviates the need to use centralised laboratories and opens up the prospect of in-field testing. This technique may enable detection of EVOO that has undergone counterfeiting or adulteration. One of the main challenges facing Raman spectroscopy for use in quality control of EVOOs is that the oxidation of EVOO, which naturally occurs due to aging, causes shifts in Raman spectra with time, which implies regular retraining would be necessary. We present a potential method of analysis to minimize the effect that aging has on discrimination efficiency; we show that by discarding the first principal component, which contains information on the variations due to oxidation, we can improve discrimination efficiency thus improving the robustness of our technique.\n\nAdvanced Wireless Power Transfer Vehicle and Infrastructure Analysis (Presentation)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGonder, J.; Brooker, A.; Burton, E.; Wang, J.; Konan, A.\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThis presentation discusses current research at NREL on advanced wireless power transfer vehicle and infrastructure analysis. The potential benefits of E-roadway include more electrified driving miles from battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or even properly equipped hybrid electric vehicles (i.e., more electrified miles could be obtained from a given battery size, or electrified driving miles could be maintained while using smaller and less expensive batteries, thereby increasing cost competitiveness and potential market penetration). The system optimization aspect is key given the potential impact of this technology on the vehicles, the power grid and the road infrastructure.\n\nCharged particle activation analysis at RIKEN.

Self-presentation has been widely studied both in face-to-face communication and online. Most online research, however, has focused on social networking sites, blogs, chatrooms, etc. while less attention has been paid to other online means of communication such as WhatsApp despite the growing im-portance of WhatsApp as a means of communication. The present paper aims to redress this imbalance by analysing self-presentation on WhatsApp; more specifically, by paying attention to emotional self-pre-sentation in profile status. To that purpose, a corpus of 206 WhatsApp statuses was gathered in Spanish. Results show the existence of recurrent patterns connected to variables such as sex1 or age, which play a crucial role in determining the emotions users choose to display in their profile status.\n\nDevelopment and Present Situation Analysis of Power Transformer State Maintenance\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLv, Sen; Li, Biao; Li, Huan\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe pivotal status of power transformer in the power system is one of the most important equipment.

However this requires increased sample size and can be inefficient, especially if there is also interest in considering combinations of the interventions. An alternative may be a factorial trial, where for two interventions participants are allocated to receive neither intervention, one or the other, or both. Factorial trials require special considerations, however, particularly at the design and analysis stages. Discussion Using a 2 Ã 2 factorial trial as an example, we present a number of issues that should be considered when planning a factorial trial. The main design issue is that of sample size. Factorial trials are most often powered to detect the main effects of interventions, since adequate power to detect plausible interactions requires greatly increased sample sizes. The main analytical issues relate to the investigation of main effects and the interaction between the interventions in appropriate regression models. Presentation of results should reflect the analytical strategy with an emphasis on the principal research questions. We also give an example of how baseline and follow-up data should be presented. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the design, analytical and presentational issues covered. Summary Difficulties in interpreting the results of factorial trials if an influential interaction is observed is the cost of the potential for efficient, simultaneous consideration of two or more interventions. Factorial trials can in principle be designed to have adequate power to detect realistic interactions, and in any case they are the only design that allows such effects to be investigated.\n\nThe past, present and future of immune repertoire biology â the rise of next-generation repertoire analysis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdrien eSix\n\n2013-11-01\n\nFull Text Available T and B cell repertoires are collections of lymphocytes, each characterised by its antigen-specific receptor. We review here classical technologies and analysis strategies developed to assess Immunoglobulin (IG and T cell receptor (TR repertoire diversity, and describe recent advances in the field. First, we describe the broad range of available methodological tools developed in the past decades, each of which answering different questions and showing complementarity for progressive identification of the level of repertoire alterations: global overview of the diversity by flow cytometry, IG repertoire descriptions at the protein level for the identification of IG reactivities, IG/TR CDR3 spectratyping strategies, and related molecular quantification or dynamics of T/B cell differentiation. Additionally, we introduce the recent technological advances in molecular biology tools allowing deeper analysis of IG/TR diversity by next-generation sequencing (NGS, offering systematic and comprehensive sequencing of IG/TR transcripts in a short amount of time. NGS provides several angles of analysis such as clonotype frequency, CDR3 diversity, CDR3 sequence analysis, V allele identification with a quantitative dimension, therefore requiring high-throughput analysis tools development. In this line, we discuss the recent efforts made for nomenclature standardisation and ontology development. We then present the variety of available statistical analysis and modelling approaches developed with regards to the various levels of diversity analysis, and reveal the increasing sophistication of modelling approaches. To conclude, we provide some examples of recent mathematical modelling strategies and perspectives that illustrate the active rise of a next-generation of repertoire analysis.\n\nA Unified Transform for LTI Systems--Presented as a (Generalized) Frame\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nFeuer, A.; Van Den Hof, P.M.J.; Heuberger, P.S.C.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe present a set of functions in L2([0,8)) and show it to be a (tight) generalized frame (as presented by G.

Methods Within-groups analysis of responses to semi-structured interviews. Interviews consisted of using prototypes in response to task-based scenarios. The prototypes were implemented on two different form factors: a tablet style PC and a pocketPC. Participants were from three user groups: general internists, family physicians and medicine residents, and from two different settings: urban and semi-urban. Verbal protocol analysis, which consists of coding utterances, was conducted on the transcripts of the testing sessions. Statistical relationships were investigated between staff physicians' and residents' background variables, self-reported experiences with the interfaces, and verbal code frequencies. Results 47 physicians were recruited from general internal medicine, family practice clinics and a residency training program. The mean age of participants was 42.6 years. Physician specialty had a greater effect on device and information-presentation preferences than gender, age, setting or previous technical experience. Family physicians preferred the screen size of the tablet computer and were less concerned about its portability. Residents liked the screen size of the tablet, but preferred the portability of the pocketPC. Internists liked the portability of the pocketPC, but saw less advantage to the large screen of the tablet computer (F[2,44] = 4.94, p = .012. Conclusion Different types of physicians have different needs and preferences for evidence-based resources and handheld devices. This study shows how user testing can be incorporated into the process of design to inform group-based customization.\n\nRapid forest change in the interior west presents analysis opportunities and challenges\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJohn D.

This globally complete, monthly analysis of surface precipitation at 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees latitude-longitude resolution is available from January 1979 to the present. It is a merged analysis that incorporates precipitation estimates from low-orbit-satellite microwave data, geosynchronous-orbit-satellite infrared data, and rain gauge observations. The merging approach utilizes the higher accuracy of the low-orbit microwave observations to calibrate, or adjust, the more frequent geosynchronous infrared observations. The data set is extended back into the premicrowave era (before 1987) by using infrared-only observations calibrated to the microwave-based analysis of the later years. The combined satellite-based product is adjusted by the raingauge analysis. This monthly analysis is the foundation for the GPCP suite of products including those at finer temporal resolution, satellite estimate, and error estimates for each field. The 23-year GPCP climatology is characterized, along with time and space variations of precipitation.\n\nInstructional Cost Analysis: History and Present Inadequacies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHumphrey, David A.\n\nThe cost analysis of instruction is conducted according to principles of teaching and learning that have often become historically dated.

E.; Langille, J.; Solheim, B.; Degenstein, D. A.; Letros, D.; Lloyd, N. D.; Loewen, P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Spatial Heterodyne Observations of Water instrument (SHOW) is limb-sounding satellite prototype that is being developed in collaboration between the University of Saskatchewan, York University, the Canadian Space Agency and ABB. The SHOW instrument combines a field-widened SHS with an imaging system to observe limb-scattered sunlight in a vibrational band of water (1363 nm - 1366 nm). Currently, the instrument has been optimized for deployment on NASA's ER-2 aircraft. Flying at an altitude of 70, 000 ft the ER-2 configuration and SHOW viewing geometry provides high spatial resolution (limb-measurements of water vapor in the Upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region. During an observation campaign from July 15 - July 22, the SHOW instrument performed 10 hours of observations from the ER-2. This paper describes the SHOW measurement technique and presents the preliminary analysis and results from these flights. These observations are used to validate the SHOW measurement technique and demonstrate the sampling capabilities of the instrument.\n\nMeasuring performance at trade shows\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHansen, KÃ¥re\n\n2004-01-01\n\nTrade shows is an increasingly important marketing activity to many companies, but current measures of trade show performance do not adequately capture dimensions important to exhibitors.

We hypothesized that COX-1 or COX-2 knockout lung fibroblasts may display altered protein profiles which may allow us to further differentiate the functional roles of these isozymes at the molecular level. Proteomic analysis shows constitutive production of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF in lung fibroblasts derived from COX-2â/â but not wild-type (WT or COX-1â/â mice. MIF was spontaneously released in high levels into the extracellular milieu of COX2â/â fibroblasts seemingly from the preformed intracellular stores, with no change in the basal gene expression of MIF. The secretion and regulation of MIF in COX-2â/â was âprostaglandin-independent.â GO analysis showed that concurrent with upregulation of MIF, there is a significant surge in expression of genes related to fibroblast growth, FK506 binding proteins, and isomerase activity in COX-2â/â cells. Furthermore, COX-2â/â fibroblasts also exhibit a significant increase in transcriptional activity of various regulators, antagonists, and co-modulators of p53, as well as in the expression of oncogenes and related transcripts. Integrative Oncogenomics Cancer Browser (IntroGen analysis shows downregulation of COX-2 and amplification of MIF and/or p53 activity during development of glioblastomas, ependymoma, and colon adenomas. These data indicate the functional role of the MIF-COX-p53 axis in inflammation and cancer at the genomic and proteomic levels in COX-2-ablated cells. This systematic analysis not only shows the proinflammatory state but also unveils a molecular signature of a pro-oncogenic state of COX-1 in COX-2 ablated cells.\n\nAn analysis of 78 breast sarcoma patients without distant metastases at presentation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMcGowan, T.S.; Cummings, B.J.; O'Sullivan, B.; Catton, C.N.; Miller, N.; Panzarella, T.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nPurpose: A retrospective review of a single cancer center experience was undertaken to identify clinical or treatment prognostic factors for these unusual tumors, to allow for a recommendation regarding management. Methods and Materials: The charts of 76 women and 2 men with breast sarcoma and without distant metastases at presentation registered from 1958 to 1990 were reviewed. Pathology was centrally reviewed in 54 cases. Histology, tumor size, grade, nodal status, age, menopausal status, history of benign breast disease, extent of surgery, resection margins, and radiation dose were each examined as potential prognostic factors by univariate analysis. To allow an analysis of radiation dose, total dose was normalized to a daily fraction size of 2 Gy. Results: The median age at diagnosis was 50.5 years (13-82 years). The pathologic diagnosis was found to be malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes in 32 patients, with the remainder being stromal sarcoma (14), angiosarcoma (8), fibrosarcoma (7), carcinosarcoma (5), liposarcoma (4), other (8). Eighteen patients had grade I or II tumors, 43 had grade III or IV, and 18 were not evaluable. The 5- and 10-year actuarial rates for all 78 patients were 57% and 48% for cause-specific survival (CSS), and 47% and 42% for the relapse-free rates (RFR), respectively. The local relapse-free rate (LRFR) was 75% at both 5 and 10 years. The 5-year CSS for grade I or II tumors was 84% versus 55% for grade III or IV tumors (p = 0.01). Conservative surgery versus mastectomy did not lead to statistically significant different outcomes for CSS, RFR, or LRFR. The comparison of positive versus negative margins showed a 5-year LRFR of 33% versus 80% (p = 0.009). Pairwise comparisons of the 5-year CSS of 91% for > 48 Gy versus either 50% for â¤ 48 Gy or 50% for no radiation showed p-values of 0.03 and 0.06, respectively. Conclusion: The authors propose that if negative surgical margins can be achieved, breast sarcoma should be managed by\n\nHigh-Resolution Observations of a Filament showing Activated Barb\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJoshi, Anand; Martin, Sara F.; Mathew, Shibu; Srivastava, Nandita\n\n2012-07-01\n\nAnalysis of a filament showing an activated barb using observations from the Dutch Open Telescope (DOT) on 2010 August 20 are presented. The DOT takes Doppler images in HÎ±, among other wavelengths, in a region about 110 Ã 110 arcsec^{2} in area, at a cadence of 30~seconds. The offline image restoration technique of speckle reconstruction is applied to obtain diffraction limited images. The filament developed a new barb in 10~minutes, which disappeared within the next 35~minutes. Such a rapid formation and disappearance of a filament barb is unusual, and has not been reported earlier. Line-of-sight velocity maps were constructed from the Doppler images of the target filament. We observe flows in the filament spine towards the barb location prior to its formation, and flows in the barb towards the spine during its disappearance. Photospheric magnetograms from Heliospheric Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, at a cadence of 45~seconds, were used to determine the changes in magnetic flux in the region surrounding the barb location. The variation of magnetic flux in this duration supports the view that barbs are rooted in minor magnetic polarity. Our analysis shows that barbs can be short-lived and formation and disappearance of the barb was associated with cancellation of magnetic flux.\n\nAnalysis of allergen immunotherapy studies shows increased clinical efficacy in highly symptomatic patients\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHowarth, P; Malling, Hans-JÃ¸rgen; Molimard, M\n\n2011-01-01\n\nthem.

Production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. The present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to total load of lactobacilli by real-time PCR. Pooled DNA was amplified by PCR with Lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. Specific PCR primers were designed for nine prominent species, including Lactobacillus gasseri, L. ultunensis, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii, L. fermentum, and L. gallinarum. More than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various Lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. Quantification by real-time PCR revealed various proportions of the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of L. gasseri and L. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. The findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of Lactobacillus spp. in the context of extension of the carious lesion.\n\nEvaluation and presentation of analysis methods for reception analysis in reprocessing\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMainka, E.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe fissile material content in the dissolving or balancing tank of a reprocessing plant has special significance in nuclear fuel balancing.

A content analysis of 740 tweets was conducted to determine the main themes associated with professionals' and educators' tweets about the show, as well as the valence of the tweets. Additionally, a thematic analysis of linked content in tweets (nÂ =Â 178) was conducted to explore additional content shared about the show and modeling outcomes. Results indicated the largest percentage of tweets was related to social learning, particularly about outcomes that could occur from viewing the show. The valence of the tweets about outcomes was more positive than negative. However, linked materials commonly circulated in tweets signified greater concern with unintended learning outcomes. Some of the linked content included media guidelines for reporting on suicide with recommendations that entertainment producers follow the guidelines. This study emphasizes the importance of including social learning objectives in future typologies of Twitter uses and demonstrates the importance of examining linked content in Twitter studies.\n\nA Quantitative Analysis of Moral Exemplars Presented in Moral Education Textbooks in Korea and Japan\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHan, Hyemin; Park, Sung Choon; Kim, Jongsung; Jeong, Changwoo; Kunii, Yutaka; Kim, Sora\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis study is a comparative analysis of the characteristics of moral exemplars presented in moral education textbooks in Korea and Japan.

Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. To understand the evolution of MARV at the codon level, we report a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in MARV genomes. Multiple codon analysis approaches and statistical methods were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, biases in codon usage, and influence of various factors, including mutation pressure, natural selection, and its two hosts, Homo sapiens and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Nucleotide composition and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed that MARV shows mutation bias and prefers U- and A-ended codons to code amino acids. Effective number of codons analysis indicated that overall codon usage among MARV genomes is slightly biased. The Parity Rule 2 plot analysis showed that GC and AU nucleotides were not used proportionally which accounts for the presence of natural selection. Codon usage patterns of MARV were also found to be influenced by its hosts. This indicates that MARV have evolved codon usage patterns that are specific to both of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from R. aegyptiacus on the MARV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from H. sapiens. Overall, mutation pressure was found to be the most important and dominant force that shapes codon usage patterns in MARV. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed codon usage analysis of MARV and extends our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to codon usage and evolution of MARV.\n\nGender identity shows a high correlation with Prader score in patients with disorders of sex development (DSD) presenting in mid childhood.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChowdhury, Tanvir K; Chowdhury, Md Zonaid; Mili, Fahmida; Hutson, John M; Banu, Tahmina\n\n2014-05-01\n\nIn developing countries like Bangladesh, delayed presentation for disorders of sex development (DSD) is common, and provides some special problems for management. There remains significant controversy about appropriate sex assignment in this group. We aimed, therefore, to assess gender identity (GI) in 50 consecutive patients with DSD presenting to a referral centre in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and correlate it with Prader score, to see if the latter could be used to predict GI. A cross-sectional, case-control study of 50 consecutive children with DSD and 50 children with vascular anomalies was conducted in the Pediatric Surgical Clinic, Chittagong Medical College and Hospital. After informed consent, patients and controls provided oral answers to a GI questionnaire and had a detailed history and physical examination. Sex-typed activities were assessed by observations of a structured toy play and the child's selection of a toy to keep. Both patients and parents then completed the Child Game Participation Questionnaire. There were no differences in age (2-16Â years, mean 8.74) between controls and DSD patients (11 46, XX DSD, 32 46, XY DSD, 4 MGD, 3 ovo-testicular DSD). Fifteen of the DSD patients (30Â %) came from consanguineous marriages and only 2 of the control patients had consanguinity of their parents. For the 13-question GI interview, there was no overall difference between DSD cases and controls. For the 46, XX DSD subgroup, there was a significantly higher score (11.1Â Â±Â 7.1) compared with control girls (4.5Â Â±Â 4.7) (pÂ gender-related behaviour correlated with Prader score for DSD patients (rÂ =Â 0.61) (pÂ gender-role behaviour should be assessed routinely in DSD patients presenting after the neonatal period, so that sex assignment is in accordance with behaviour. Prader scores showed a good correlation with GI and gender role behaviour.\n\nThe rank-heat plot is a novel way to present the results from a network meta-analysis including multiple outcomes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVeroniki, Areti Angeliki; Straus, Sharon E; Fyraridis, Alexandros; Tricco, Andrea C\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTo present a novel and simple graphical approach to improve the presentation of the treatment ranking in a network meta-analysis (NMA) including multiple outcomes. NMA simultaneously compares many relevant interventions for a clinical condition from a network of trials, and allows ranking of the effectiveness and/or safety of each intervention. There are numerous ways to present the NMA results, which can challenge their interpretation by research users. The rank-heat plot is a novel graph that can be used to quickly recognize which interventions are most likely the best or worst interventions with respect to their effectiveness and/or safety for a single or multiple outcome(s) and may increase interpretability. Using empirical NMAs, we show that the need for a concise and informative presentation of results is imperative, particularly as the number of competing treatments and outcomes in an NMA increases. The rank-heat plot is an efficient way to present the results of ranking statistics, particularly when a large amount of data is available, and it is targeted to users from various backgrounds.

When such a copious source of neutrons - the nuclear reactor - became available, commencing in 1945, the power of the method to determine many elements, quantitatively, even though present in samples at concentrations as low as ppb, attracted many scientists. During about the next 20 years (1945-1965), NAA provided the first major results on trace elements (essential and toxic) in biomedical materials. These studies constituted the first major achievement of NAA - and such studies continue. Due to the initial lack of a high-efficiency detector of gamma radiation, work during the early part of this period had to be carried out by tedious radiochemical separations. Starting in the early 1950's, with the advent of the NaI(Tl) scintillation detector and multichannel pulse-height analyzers, the purely-instrumental form of the method (INAA) was born, and research and applications mushroomed. In the 1960s, two additional important applications of NAA were its vital use in the semiconductor industry and in the analysis of the lunar rocks. The INAA method in this period was greatly advanced by the availability of high-resolution germanium detectors. Applications in environmental studies, archaeology, and forensic chemistry were also of note. INAA is now a mature method, but still improving. As for the future, what is still needed are less expensive high-flux neutron sources, simple automated systems, gamma-ray detectors of even better resolution, and faster electronics. The field of NAA has been, and is, blessed by a large number of outstanding scientists, world-wide, all intrigued by the atomic nucleus and radioactive decay\n\nFactor analysis shows association between family activity e"
