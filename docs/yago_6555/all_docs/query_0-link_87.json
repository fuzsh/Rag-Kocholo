        "text": "\"I recommend the attached document by Attorney Mike Scarborough for critical information about the effects of U.S. land rights legislation and a positive prospectus for future action. . . . Armando Rendon\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe following testimony is written in support of my request that the Commission on Hispanic Legal Rights and Responsibilities of the American bar Association explore various ways to approach the necessity of undoing grave injustices perpetrated upon the Indian, Spanish and Mexican people and the unlawful taking of vast portions of their reservations and land grants during the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nThe information provided in support of this request represents the comparative history of the groups addressed and invites serious research not only into the issues presented, but in seeking remedies to heal the open sores of a century of intentional governmental maltreatment.\n\nTHE HISTORY\n\nIt is not enough that historians research and document the maltreatment of individual protected groups. They must also draw comparisons of the maltreatment of different protected groups within the same time period if we are to fully comprehend the consequence of such treatment. It is the purpose of this paper to draw a comparison of not only the difference in the treatment of the general population compared to the Native American; or the difference in the treatment of the general population compared to the treatment of the Spanish, Mexican and Pueblo Indian land grantees in the Southwest in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuriesbut to also draw a comparison of the difference in treatment of these protected groups compared with each other. In other words, in order to arrive at an accurate historical understanding of the prevalent adverse treatment, it is essential that we draw comparisons between the manner in which each of these groups were being treated during the same period of time.\n\nWhile researching the disregard congress had for Native American, Spanish and Mexican citizens property rights between 1887 and 1907, two facts became clear, Congress had no moral compassand the executive and judicial branches were in lock-step with Congress.\n\nThe first act we need to address is the 1887 Dawes Act, the title of which began quite innocuously. It simply stated that the law was being enacted to:\n\n... Provide for the Allotment of Lands in Severalty to Indians on the Various Reservations, and to Extend the Protection of the Laws of the United States and the Territories Over the Indians, and for Other Purposes.\n\n1\n\nIt wasn't unreasonable to conclude from the first line that the purpose of the act was to allot land to Indians in severalty. After considering why Congress chose to use the term \"over the Indians\" rather than \"to the Indians,\" the words \"and for other purposes\" jumped off the page as they well should have. The term \"for other purposes,\" offers no hint of what Congress was planning to accomplish. All that was clear was that its use was the forewarning of an ominous result.\n\nThe true intent of the act did not surface until Section Five where it became clear that Congress was establishing a process to grant the president the power to remove lands from reservations which had been created for the use of the Indians by \"treaty stipulation, by virtue of an act of Congress, or by executive order.\" Regardless of whether the lands were agricultural, had been sold with or without irrigation, or had been released to the United States by an Indian tribe, it was the intent of Congress that the land removed from the reservations should be:\n\n... [To be] held by the United States for the sole purpose of securing homes to actual settler ... disposed of by the United States to actual and bona fide settlers only...\n\nThe Dawes Act made it clear that it was the intention of Congress to abrogate the governments treaty responsibilities to the tribesto remove as much land as possible from the reservations.\n\nSeveral additional references to the Dawes Act bear mention that they can be compared to the terms of the Court of Private Land Claims Act.\n\nAmong the other problems created by Congress was its intention to distribute reservation land in a manner that was in conflict with the laws regarding descent and distribution which were in affect at the time.\n\nThe method Congress chose to distribute the land to the Indians in severalty was to allot it as follows:\n\nTo each head of a family, one-quarter of a section; [160 acres].\n\nTo each single person over eighteen years of age, one-eighth of a section; [80 acres].\n\nTo each orphan child under eighteen years of age, one-eighth of a section; [80 acres].\n\nTo each other single person under eighteen years now living, or who may be born prior to the date of the order of the President directing an allotment of the lands embraced in any reservation, one sixteenth of a section: [40 acres].\n\nEven though the planned distribution was contrary in a number of respects to the laws of descent and distribution of the various states and territories, the act further stated that:\n\nProvided, That the law of descent and distribution in force in the State or Territory where such lands are situate shall apply thereto after patents therefor have been executed and delivered....\n\nBy drafting the act and allotting the land as it did, Congress was denying married women a share of their land. Of course, had married women been allowed their rightful share of the land the result would have had the effect of reducing the amount of land the government was attempting to take from the reservations and given to the \"actual and bona fide setters.\"\n\nAnother anomaly in the language was that once the Indians had received their allotments, Congress required that:\n\nissue].\n\nSec. 5. ... upon the approval of the allotments provided for in this act by the Secretary of the Interior, he shall cause patents to issue therefor in the name of the allottees ... and declare that the United States ... will hold the land thus allotted, for a period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made ...: Provided, that the President of the United States may in any case in his discretion extend the period.\n\nYet, in the case of the actual and bona fide settlers, the holding period was different: ... after the expiration of five years occupancy thereof as a homestead; [patents could\n\nTo establish further evidence of how hypocritical the Dawes Act was, we need only to quote from a sentence from Section 6:\n\n... [N]o Territory shall pass or enforce any law denying any such Indian within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.\n\nThe Dawes Act establishes that Congress was perfectly comfortable enacting legislation which not only abrogated the governments treat responsibility ...comfortable in ignoring the Indians rights to equal protection of the law.\n\nJust five years after the passage of the Dawes Act it became abundantly clear from a passage in Harrison's 1892 Farewell address just how effective the Dawes Act had been in separating the Indians from their land. He stated:\n\n[T]he enormous cessions of Indian lands which have been opened to settlement, aggregating during this Administration [from 1889 through 1892] nearly 26,000,000 acres, and the agreements renegotiated and now pending in Congress for ratification by which about 10,000,000 additional acres will be opened to settlement, it will be seen how much has been accomplished.\n\nIn the five years between passage of the Dawes Act and Harrison's reelection loss, 36 million acres of Indian lands, created for their use, had been taken from them by the artifice of transferring their common lands to them individually.\n\nIn 1891 Congress expanded its focus and struck again by designing and passing a law to take land which had belonged for decades to grantees and heirs of Spanish and Mexican land grants which were supposed to have been protected by the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Congress would use its Court of Private Land Claims and Forest Reserve Acts to relieve the Spanish and Mexican settlers of millions of acres over the next fourteen years. One of Harrison's appointed justices, Wilbur F. Stone even went so far as to state in the closing paragraph of an article he had written and which was presented to the 1904 annual meeting of the New Mexico Territorial Bar Association, that:\n\n... [T]he reversion to the public domain of the general government of more than 30,000,000 acres of [Spanish and Mexican grant] land comes the [sic]like new cession of country to the United Statesa region illimitable in the undeveloped wealth of its coal, metals, agriculture and healthgiving climate.\n\nTo further aggravate the discriminatory turmoil caused by the Dawes, Court of Private Land Claims and Forest Reserve Acts, the General Accounting Office (GAO) upon the request of Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman, began an investigation in 2000 of the \"fairness\" of the resolution of the Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty protected land grant claims. After a four year inquiry the GAO's conclusion was that:\n\nNot withstanding the compliance of the two New Mexico confirmation procedures ... the processes were inefficient and created hardships for the grantees.\n\nThe GAO forewarned of its conclusion when, early in its report, it stated that whether racial prejudice had contributed to shortcomings in the land grant adjudication process would not be addressed as it was collateral to and beyond the scope of its report. As if that were not enough of an insult to the land grant community, it stated (and restated on three additional occasions) that:\n\n... [A]s agreed, GAO does not express an opinion on whether the United States fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty as a matter of international law.\n\nThe GAO, having made it clear that it was not going to investigate whether racial prejudice existed in the adjudication process or whether the United States had fulfilled its obligations under the treaty was left with nothing better to do other than possibly sending a gopher to the local Home Depot to purchase a gallon or two of whitewash.\n\nHaving touched upon Congress' use of its limitless powers to ignore equal protection of the law, and it's circumvention of treaty stipulations, we need next to direct our attention to direct evidence existing at the time of the government's negative attitude toward the Spanish and Mexican land grants and their grantees. In the interest of reaching an accurate conclusion about what the politicians were thinking at the time, we need to listen to what they were actually saying at the time.\n\nThe State of the Union addresses made at the time provide an excellent clue into the thinking in Washington at the time. Addresses made before 1912 were of particularly importance as they were submitted in writing and left virtually no room for speculation.\n\nHarrison's 1891 address contained a statement regarding the passage of the Court of Private Land Claims Act and the appointment of the justices to the court:\n\nThe judges of the Court of Private Land Claims, provided for by the Act of March 3, 1891, have been appointed and the court organized. It is now possible to give early relief to communities long repressed in their development by unsettled land titles and to establish the possession and right of settlers whose lands have been rendered valueless by adverse and unfounded claims ...\n\nHe dared to say to the world, (Spain and Mexico included) that with the organization of the court and his appointment of the justices complete, it was finally going to be possibly to grant relief to those settlers who had been repressed in the development of their communities by the unfounded claims and unsettled titles of the Spanish and Mexican land grants.\n\nHarrison's statement above was not just an isolated comment as he mentioned land grants in several other state of the union addresses as well:\n\nIn an address prior to the passage of the acts, he had said:\n\n...[T]he subject of the unadjusted Spanish and Mexican land grants and the urgent necessity for providing some commission or tribunal for the trial of questions of title growing out of them were twice brought by me to the attention of Congress at the last session. Bills have been reported from the proper committees in both houses upon the subject, and I very earnestly hope that this Congress will put an end to the delay which has attended the settlement of the disputes as to the title between the settlers and the claimants under the grants. These disputes retard the prosperity and disturb the peace of large and important communities.\n\nSubsequently, he also stated:\n\nYour attention is called to the difficulty presented by the Secretary of the Interior as to the administration of the law of March 3, 1891, establishing a Court of Private Land Claims. The small holdings intended to be protected by the law are estimated to be more than 15,000 in number. The claimants are a most deserving class and their titles are supported by the strongest equities. The difficulty grows out of the fact that the lands have largely been surveyed according to our methods...while the holdings, many of which have been in the same family for generations, are laid out in narrow strips a few rods wide upon a stream and running back to the hills for pasturage and timber....\n\nOnce again Harrison was choosing to draw a distinction between the grantees of the land grants on the one hand, \"whose lands are laid out in narrow strips a few rods wide\", and the claimants, \"who are a most deserving class\" ... [and whose] \"titles are supported by the strongest equities.\"\n\nInterestingly, the Court of Private Land Claims Act was devoid of any language that even suggested that the act had been enacted to resolve claims of claimants who were a most deserving class and whose titles were supported by the strongest equities.\n\nAs if mention of Harrison's lack of concern for the grantees of the land grants and his concern for the settlers in the Southwest in his state of the union addresses was not enough, he also addressed the subject in a communication directed specifically to members of Congress.\n\nThe entire community where these large claims exist, and indeed all of our people, are interested in an early and final settlement of them. No greater incubus can rest upon the energies of a people in the development of a new country than that resulting from unsettled land titles.\n\nWhile Harrison was making these comments, his Secretary of Interior, John Noble, was not silent on the subject. On April 26, 1891 he was quoted in the New York Times as having said:\n\nThe last Congress passed several measures which will affect the work of the Interior Department considerably. The land laws were very materially altered.\n\nThe act which creates the court to settle Mexican land claims will take a great burden off the Interior Department, which has done whatever has been done in the way of adjusting these claims. The act, or something like it has long been needed, and the work of settling these cases, which involve millions of acres may now be said to be fairly begun.\n\nOn the occasion of being asked who should replace him as Secretary of Interior once Harrison had lost his bid for reelection, Noble was quoted as having said:\n\nSomeone should be appointed who has no connection whatever with land grants in the West, unless the Administration wants to see this department of the Government attacked very bitterly on all sides....\n\nMoving on to President Theodore Roosevelt's administration, we find that his attitude toward the Spanish and Mexican land grants and the grantees and their heirs was no different\n\nthan the attitude during Harrison's administration. Evidence shows that Roosevelt continued Harrison's scheme of removing as much land as possible from the Spanish and Mexican grants.\n\nCongress did not stop fold its tent with the establishment the Court of Private Land Claims as it also enacted on the same day with an omnibus bill which included a section that became known as the Forest Reserve Act.\n\nThe significance of Section 24 is that it was used by Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot, his national forest supervisor, to proclaim over 145 million acres of land as forest reserves. Unfortunately, a large portion of the land had previously belonged within Indian reservations and the Spanish and Mexican land grants in the Southwest.\n\nIt read as follows:\n\nSec. 24.That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations; and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof.\n\nRoosevelt and Pinchot were prolific in their establishment of forest reserves until they were caught red handed attempting to establish a reserve in Washington State. In that instance they found themselves in serious trouble with the local people who realized that thousands of acres of their state had been proclaimed a forest reserve.\n\nThe following is an explanation of what occurred once Roosevelt's proclamation was discovered. It is from an article titled: The Forest Service: Fighting for Public Lands, (Understanding our Government), authored by Gerald W. Williams. It addresses the quandary in which Roosevelt and Pinchot found themselves:\n\nIn January1907, there was considerable opposition to a Presidential proclamation that reserved thousands of acres of prime Douglas-fir timberlands in northern Washington State. The local press, chambers of commerce, and the Washington State congressional delegation protested that the reserve would cause undue hardship on residents by taking away homestead and \"prime\" agricultural lands (the land, in fact, was not agricultural, abut[sic] heavily forested) as well as impeding the future development of the State.\n\nThe article goes on to describe Roosevelt and Pinchot's manner of attempting to resolve the matter :\n\nAfter considerable pressure, Roosevelt and Pinchot relented by, by[sic] saying that the reserve had been a \"clerical\" error. Soon thereafter, Senator Charles W. Fulton of Oregon, who had been implicated in the land frauds in that State, introduced an amendment to the annual agricultural appropriations bill.\n\nThis amendment, the Fulton Amendment prohibited the President from creating any additional forest reserves in the six Western States of Washington Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado; took away his power to proclaim reserves, established under the Forest Reserve (Creative) Act of 1891; and gave Congress alone the authority to establish reserves. However, before this bill was signed into law on March 4, 1907, Gifford Pinchot and the President came up with a plan.\n\nOn the eve of the bill's signing, Chief Forester Pinchot and his assistant Arthur C. Ringland used a heavy blue pencil to draw many new forest reserves on maps. As soon as a map was finished and a proclamation written, the President signed the paper to establish another forest reserve. On March 1st and 2nd, Roosevelt established 17 new or combined forest reserves containing over 16 million acres in these six Western States....These have since been referred to as the \"Midnight Reserves.\"\n\nCounting additional reserves that Roosevelt and Pinchot proclaimed in territories outside the six states, it is believed that they had actually converted more than 30 million acres to forest reserves in the two days the bill lay on Roosevelt's desk awaiting his signature.\n\nThere could be no better support for the information provided in the article just quoted than Roosevelt's own words from his 1913 autobiography as subsequently compiled and edited in 2005 from research done by the National Geographic Society and Theodore Roosevelt Association staff:\n\nWhile the Agricultural Appropriation Bill was passing through the Senate, in 1907, Senator Fulton, of Oregon, secured an amendment providing that the President could not set aside any additional National Forests in the six Northwestern States. This meant retaining some sixteen million of acres to be exploited by land grabbers and by the representatives of the great special interests, at the expense of the public interest.\n\nBut for four years the Forest Service had been gathering field notes as to what forests ought to be set aside in these States, and so was prepared to act. It was equally undesirable to veto the whole agricultural bill, and to sign it with this amendment effective. Accordingly, a plan to create the necessary National Forest in these States before the Agricultural Bill could be passed and signed was laid before me by Mr. Pinchot. I approved it. The necessary papers were immediately prepared. I signed the last proclamation a couple of days before by my signature, the bill became law; and when the friends of the special interests in the Senate got their amendment through and woke up, they discovered that sixteen million acres of timberland had been saved for the people by putting them in the National Forests before the land grabbers could get at them.\n\nThe opponents of the Forest Service turned handsprings in their wrath; and dire were their threats against the Executive; but the threats could not be carried out, and were really only a tribute to the efficiency of our action.\n\nAccording to a 2001 article by Dennis Cowals, entitled: Theodore Roosevelt and the Siuslaw National Forest:\n\nThe forest reserves of the United States quadrupled to about 194,000,000 acres ... [and was equal in area to] all the states on the Atlantic coast from Maine to Virginia and the states of Vermont, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. [Greater in] area than France, Belgium, and The Netherlands combined.\n\nFurthermore:\n\nOver Roosevelt's articulate objections, \"An Act making appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and eight,\" H.R. 24815, Public Act No. 242, U.S. Congress. 59th. 2nd Session was passed on Feb. 25, 1907. Unwilling to pocket-veto the entire appropriations act, Roosevelt permitted Gifford Pinchot and his staff to identify some 16,000,000 acres of forest in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado and Wyoming which the President then designated as new national forest lands by executive order, between Congress's passage of the bill and its signing on Marth [sic] 4th by the reluctant President, who was now forbidden to create or enlarge the newly designated National Forests.\n\nIt is important at this juncture to draw a comparison of two land grants in Northern New Mexicoto compare Harrison's 1892 Proclamation setting aside the Pecos River Forest Reserve with Roosevelt's 1905 Proclamation establishing the Jémez Forest Reserve.\n\nOne significant difference was that Harrison's proclamation had been described by township and range while Roosevelt's, Jemez Forest Reserve Proclamation had no description at allsimply a grid map. Additionally, Harrison's proclamation had an important paragraph which was missing from Roosevelt's. It read:\n\nExcepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all land which may have been prior to the date hereof embraced in any valid Spanish or Mexican grant or in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly made in the proper United States land office\n\nRoosevelt's proclamation for the Jémez Forest Reserve totally ignored the importance of protecting the interests of \"all land[s] which may have been prior to the date hereof embraced in any valid Spanish or Mexican grants.\" He obviously did not wish to be bothered by the fact that he was absconding with 800,000 acres of grant landthus leaving the San Joaquín del Río de Chama, Juan Bautista Valdez and La Petaca grants with less than 5,000 total combined acres.\n\nOn the other hand there was a striking similarity in both proclamations. Both mentioned an identical reason for being established. Harrison's proclamation for the Pecos River Forest Reserve read:\n\nAnd whereas the public lands in the Territory of New Mexico within the limits hereinafter described are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation.\n\nWhile Roosevelt's Jémez Proclamation stated:\n\nAnd whereas, the public lands, in the Territory of New Mexico, which are hereinafter indicated, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart said lands as a public reservation;...\n\nUnfortunately, the negative political climate against the Spanish and Mexican land grantees and their heirs was not limited to presidents and secretaries of the Department of Interior. Senator Albert J. Beveridge, chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories and a close friend and confidant of President Roosevelt, was extremely outspoken when describing the Spanish and Mexican settlers in New Mexico and Arizona whose families had refused to leave after the U.S./Mexican War. His statements on the floor of the Senate and elsewhere were highly inappropriate, and included his apparent belief that the Spanish and Mexican citizen residents of New Mexico and Arizona:\n\n... [W]eren't equal in intellect, resources, or population to the other states in the Union. Nor, said he, were they sufficiently American in their habits and customs.\n\nA trip Beveridge took to the southwest was described by Howard Roberts Lamar in his 2000 book: The Far Southwest, 1846-1912: a territorial history, as follows:\n\nWhen in the early fall of 1902, his [Senator Beverage's] committee took up the question of admission, he and a subcommittee made a whirlwind tour of the three Western territories. From the questions he asked it was clear that he liked \"American\" Oklahoma, but that he was acutely hostile to the idea of statehood for \"frontier\" Arizona and \"Mexican\" New Mexico.\n\n[I]t appears that Beveridge's real reasons were not economic or reformist but cultural. He returned to Washington believing that the Spanish-speaking residents of the Southwest were at best second-class citizens, passive, pliant, and uneducated. Beveridge and his supporters were to argue for the next eight years that the Spanish-Americans were not at home with United States law, its court and school systems, or even with the English language.\n\nIn an article in the New York Times of December 6, 1902, it was stated that:\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 5. Senator Beveridge is preparing an exhaustive report on the Statehood bill to present to the Senate before next Wednesday, when it will be taken up as unfinished business and considered until voted on unless Senator Quay is sidetracked by Senator Hale and the other parliamentarians of the Senate who are opposed to admitting the three Territories of New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma.\n\nAs to Arizona and New Mexico, it will be urged by the committee who visited the Territories that in parts of both the native American citizen sometimes feels that he is in a foreign country. Spanish is spoken and in some places public business is conducted in Spanish. The sub-committee that went out there recently found Justices of the Peace that tried cases in court in Spanish and spoke no English.\n\nSenator Beveridge's dislike for the Spanish and Mexican settlers was so pronounced that he succeeded in convincing Roosevelt to hold back New Mexico and Arizona's statehood for nearly ten years. Likewise, the use of the term \"native American\" as used above, is quite telling. The land grant settlers and their heirs had been United States citizens since 1849for over fifty years by the time the settlers arriving from the east were being referred to by Beveridge and his cohorts as \"native\" Americans. One wonders how many generations an ethnic group of citizens would have had to live in the United States before Senator Beveridge and his colleagues in the Senate would have been willing to recognize them as \"native\" Americans.\n\nTo show how close New Mexico and Arizona became to being granted statehood and the extreme to which Senator Beveridge was willing to go to deny them statehood once he realized that there was enough support in his committee to send the bill to the full senate; and realized further that there was a sufficient number of votes in the full senate to grant them statehood, we need return to Lamar's, The Far Southwest:\n\n[Senator] Beveridge was not to be defeated. After mobilizing many other senators and using filibustering techniques, he resorted to an unexpected device. For reasons of courtesy no vote could take place without his presence as chairman of the Territorial Committee. At the crucial moment he hid on the third floor of Gifford Pinchot's home for a week and the time passed when a territorial bill could be considered in 1903.\n\nHaving discussed the 1887 Dawes Act and the 1891 Court of Private Land Claims and Forest Reserve Acts, it is time to turn our attention to the GAO's 2004 Report (GAO-04-59) which was titled: Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: Findings and Possible Options Regarding Longstanding Community Land Grant Claims in New Mexico in order to draw a comparison of the government's treatment of the Indians and their reservations vis-à-vis the land grant settlers who had been living on their land for generations. In doing so, I am in no way suggesting that either group received preferential treatment over the otheronly raising the issue to show that in each case Congress was intentionally discriminating against the group being addressed.\n\nIn the case of the Court of Private Land Claims Act, the settlers were not allotted land their ancestors had settled upon decades earlier. In fact, before Roosevelt proclaimed the Jémez Forest Reserve, the government had physically removed all evidence of the existence of the San Joaquín del Río de Chama, Juan Bautista and La Petaca grants from a number of its official maps.\n\nOne of the more interesting, yet alarming facts about the GAO Report was the extent to which the GAO was willing to go to conceal Congress' specific demand that the Court of Private Land Claims protect the property rights of three specific groups of individuals.\n\nSection 12 of the GAO's Appendix VII, which was titled: Excerpts from the 1891 Act Establishing the Court of Private Land Claims, and which appears at page 186 of its report, read as follows:\n\nSec. 12. That all claims mentioned in section six of this act which are by the provisions of this act authorized to be prosecuted shall, at the end of two years from the taking effect of this act, if no petition in respect to the same shall have then been filed as herein before provided, be deemed and taken, in all courts and elsewhere, to be abandoned and shall be forever barred....\n\nSection 12 of the original act did not end with the words \"and shall be forever barred,\" as implied by the GAO's use of a four dot ellipse. The paragraph, as enacted, continued as follows:\n\n... and shall be forever barred: Provided, That in any case where it shall come to the knowledge of the court that minors, married women, or persons non compos mentis are interested in any land claim or matter brought before the court it shall be its duty to appoint a guardian ad litem for such persons under disability and require a petition to be filed in their behalf, as in other cases, and if necessary to appoint counsel for the protection of their rights....\n\nThe remainder of the sentence, which the GAO had very conveniently left out, turned out to be one of the most important, most significant, provisions of the law as it clearly directed the Court, at least so far as children, married women and persons non compos mentis were concerned, to protect their property rights, even to the extent of directing the appointment of guardians for them.\n\nA question that begs consideration is: why wouldwhy did, the GAO ignore the demand of the statute that the property interests of minor children, married women and persons non compos mentis should be protected?\n\nUnfortunately, Sec. 12 was not the only section of the act that the GAO \"overlooked.\" Here is another example of the court having failed to address the statutory language:\n\nSection 8....It shall be lawful for and the duty of the head of the Department of Justice, whenever in his opinion the public interest or the rights of any claimant shall require it, to cause the attorney of the United States in said court to file in said court a petition against the holder or possessor of any claim or land in any of the States or Territories mentioned in this act who shall not have voluntarily come in under the provisions of this act, stating in substance that the title of such holder or possessor is open to question, or stating in substance that the boundaries of any such land, the claimant or possessor to or of which has not brought the matter into court, are open to question, and praying that the title to any such land, or the boundaries thereof, if the title be admitted be settled and adjudicated; and thereupon the court shall, on such notice to such claimant or possessor as it shall deem reasonable, proceed to hear, try, and determine the questions stated in such petition or arising in the matter, and determine the matter according to law, justice, and the provisions of this act, but subject to all lawful rights adverse to such claimant or possessor, as between such claimant and possessor and any other claimant or possessor, and subject in this respect to all the provisions of this section applicable thereto.\n\nCongress was demanding that the United States Department of Justice, the United States Attorney and the justices of the Court of Private Land Claims protect the rights of those Spanish, Mexican and Pueblo Indian grantees and heirs who had failed to claim their interest under the provisions of the act.\n\nCongress, in the language of the Dawes Act, had addressed the property interests of Indians who had failed to come forward with their claims at the time the government was providing land to individual allotments, differently. Section 1 of the Dawes Act had stated:\n\nThat if any one entitled to an allotment shall fail to make a selection within four years after the President shall direct that allotments may be made on a particular reservation, the Secretary of the Interior may direct the agent of such tribe or band, if such there be, and if there be no agent, then a special agent appointed for that purpose, to make a selection for such Indian, which selection shall be allotted as in cases where selections are made by the Indians ...\n\nA comparison of these two sections clearly establishes that Congress, in dealing with the Indians on their reservations and the Spanish and Mexican Grantees and their heirs on their land grants, had intentionally treated them unequallynot to mention that both groups were being treated different than the \"native\" Americans arriving from the east.\n\nThe information provided here is but an embryonic snapshot of our government's maltreatment of its Indian, Spanish and Mexican citizens property rights over the past thirteen\n\ndecades. Since the passage of the Dawes, Court of Private Land Claims and Forest Reserve Acts, other than the establishment of an Indian Claims Commission to allow Indian Tribes to file claims against the United States, not a whimper has been heard from the government regarding the continuing adverse effects of the maltreatment discussed above.\n\nIn considering whether it is to early or to late to attempt to correct this century of maltreatment and disregard for a significant portion of our population Congress can no longer afford to ignore recent census data. Man's inhumanity to man will not survive as the order of the day in the future.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOnce further research on the issues raised here is complete, a course of action to correct the discriminatory history set out herein must be determined. My extensive research had led me to the conclusion that there are really only two viable courses of action which offer any hope for an ultimate resolution.\n\nThe first is to use a mechanism from the pastto initially seek presidential executive order reservations and land grants to begin a process of returning at lease a portion of the land taken as a show of good faith. These reservations and grants would require congressional approval and could be subject to attack by a subsequent president. For that reason it seems provident that patents issue immediately after congressional approval of the reservations and grants.\n\nWhat better time to approach Congress with a request to approve presidential executive order reservations and land grants than nowfifteen months before a presidential election and a year after a national census that indicates, if this is not resolved nowit will come to pass, whether the present political stalemate can find a way to work together or not.\n\nThe other, more expensive, more time consuming process would be to request Congress extend the life of the Indian Claims Commission. However, this should not even be considered unless Congress would be it willing to expand the jurisdiction of the Commission to allow the heirs of the Spanish and Mexican land grants access to the procedure so that they might finally be able to challenge the government's taking of millions of acres of their Treaty protected land a century ago.\n\nIn 1886, the year before the Dawes Act became law, Leo Tolstoy published a short story which has often been mentioned as possibly the best short story ever written. The title of that story was, How Much Land Does a Man Need? If you have never read the story, or if it has been some time since you read it, consider reading it again.\n\nWhile reading it give thought to Manifest Destiny, to the Dawes, Court of Private Land Claims and Forest Reserve Acts; to Presidents Harrison and Roosevelt; take a few minutes to think about the Indians and the Spanish and Mexican grantees and their heirs, all of whom lost millions of acres ; think about the U.S./Mexican war and all the treaties that were broken when the government was taking the land.\n\nMike Scarborough"
