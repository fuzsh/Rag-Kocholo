        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nTIO is a rare clinical entity with only few 100 cases published so far. These tumors are very small in size and generally slow growing. They may be located in the unusual sites ranging from head to toe and may arise from bone or soft-tissue.[3] Patients of TIO present with vague symptoms of generalized body ache, muscular weakness and bone or muscle tenderness etc., Patient may become bed ridden if diagnosis and treatment is delayed. Majority of the tumor causing osteomalacia cases are of benign in nature and rarely metastasize to distant organs.[4] These tumors secrete phosphaturic substances that inhibit renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate and FGF23 is one of them resulting in the abnormal phosphate metabolism.[5] The presence of renal phosphate wasting in the patient as the etiology for hypophosphatemia suggests the possibility of the TIO. The biochemical parameters may reveal elevated plasma FGF23, low or inappropriately normal 1,25 vitamin D, normal calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, but PTH can be high, reflecting secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a normal response to low 1,25 vitamin D caused by elevated FGF23 and alkaline phosphatase.[6] Once FGF23-dependent phosphate wasting disorder due to TIO is made, thorough physical examination should be done to look for these tumors which may be found in subcutaneous tissue as well as in the skeletal system.[7,8]\n\nThe morphological and functional imaging modalities including computed tomography (CT), whole body magnetic resonance imaging, fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, In-111 Octreotide and Ga-68Dotatate PET/CT[4,9,10,11] have been used to localize the tumor. Many times, the imaging may fail to localize them due to their small size and unusual location. Histopathology of the resected tumor is required for definitive diagnosis and the complete resection lead to cure of the patient with normalization of phosphate and FGF23 levels.[12] X-ray confirmation of osteomalacia is difficult with non-specific changes such as osteopenia. The radiologic findings in case of osteomalacia would be increased concentration of osteoid formation with impaired mineralization. Pseudofractures or Looser's zones are insufficiency stress fractures that may appear before the other radiologic changes in osteomalacia.[13] Pseudofractures are typical bilateral, more or less symmetrical and tend to occur at specific sites. Their presence has been considered to be pathognomic for the presence of osteomalacia.[14,15]\n\nBone scan is highly sensitive imaging modality for detecting the skeletal metastases. However, its use is limited in metabolic bone disease and usually detects the affected bones due to TIO rather than the primary tumor.[16] The bone scan findings of TIO may mimic metastatic bone lesions making it difficult to differentiate from metastatic disease. The whole body bone scan in TIO may demonstrate typical findings of osteomalacia, i.e. widening of the mandible, rachitic rosary sign, tie sign of sternum, pseuodofracture and prominent epiphyses of knees suggesting it to be metabolic in nature.[17] There are very few descriptions of bone scan pattern in TIO in the literature so far. In two case reports of TIO, the bone scans demonstrated multiple foci of increased tracer uptake.[15,18] It is worth to note that the uptake pattern in bone scan in TIO and osteomalacia secondary to other causes like malabsorption, renal failure, vitamin D deficiency and drugs is almost similar.[16]\n\nFogelman et al.,[19] described the findings seen in bone scans in the 10 patients with osteomalacia from various causes. They have described various features observed in the bone scan: Increased tracer uptake by the axial skeleton, long bones and wrists, prominent calvarium and mandible, beading of the costochondral junction, faint kidneys, pseudofracture in the form of focal abnormalities and tie sternum. The bone to soft tissue ratio is significantly high in osteomalacia. The increased tracer uptake in long bones and wrist joints along with prominence of calvarium and mandible are some of the most consistent abnormal finding in osteomalacia, but may also be seen in primary hyperparathyroidism. The presence of beading of the costochondral junction and tie sternum may be non-specific and can be seen in patients with renal osteodystrophy. These non-specific features strongly suggest a metabolic disorder, in the presence of clinical and biochemical findings."
