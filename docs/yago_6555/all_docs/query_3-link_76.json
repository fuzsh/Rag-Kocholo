        "text": "On April 30, 1989, in the City of Buenos Aires, a man died who with his character awakened the spirit of adventure of millions of children around the world, that day the life of Guy Williams, \"El Zorro\", was extinguished. He was born on January 14, 1924, in New York, in a family of Sicilian immigrants with the name of Armand Joseph Catalano, he spent his poor, but dignified childhood in the \"Little Italy\" neighborhood of Brooklyn. While he was in high school at George Washington High School he excelled in math, chess and fencing, a sport inherited by family tradition. He was a welder, an aeronautical safety inspector and a salesman, but his 1.90 meter height had a reserved place for him in advertising. His face began to be used in magazines and newspapers in advertisements for cups, mattresses, lotions and cigarettes. His Italian surname closed the doors of Hollywood to him, so in 1946 he changed his name to \"Guy Williams\". After small roles for MGM, he moved on to Universal and began getting more opportunities as roles in \"The Man from the Alamo\" and \"The Lone Ranger.\" In 1957, Walt Disney was looking for a Latino, handsome and with knowledge of fencing, the name \"Williams\" was the only one on the list, Walt interviewed him personally and gave him the role of his life \"El Zorro\". This romantic and brave hero captivated the US public and quickly transcended borders, mainly those of Latin America. Guy became the highest paid star between the years '57 and '59, the years that the series lasted, finally due to problems between Disney and ABC the program was canceled in its prime. Williams remained in the producers' consideration and had guest appearances in \"Bonanza\" and \"Lost in Space.\" The journalist and producer Leo Glazer hired him for TV Argentina, he was received as a hero by thousands of fans who overflowed the Ezeiza Airport. Despite being a star, he toured schools and hospitals carrying gifts and doing small performances without charging a penny. His relationship with Argentina was accentuated on a second trip to which he brought his friend \"Henry Calvin\", \"Sergeant García\". For a presentation on Channel 13 he asked them to bring him the best swordsman they could, they brought him a young Fernando Lupiz, whom he hired several times on his tours. Despite the cancellation of a Palito Ortega blockbuster called \"El Rey\", he decided to stay and live in Buenos Aires and rented an apartment in the Palacio Alvear. In May 1989, several neighbors noticed the absence of him in the usual places and called the police who found him dead in his apartment, it was established that he had died a week before on April 30 of a stroke, he was 65 years old."
