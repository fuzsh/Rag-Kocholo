To be fair, some of the scenes where his character interacted with a little girl he was foster-parenting weren't as grimly unpleasant as everything else I've seen him in, presented him in a better light than I expected.\n\nIt's the kind of musical that fulfills genre expectations by putting the central characters in a a series of situations where they can watch Eurovision-sounding pop stars of the moments perform their hits; there was a run of movies in Argentina that followed this strategy there at the turn of the '80s. I hate that Eurovision sound. Hate it, hate it. Echemos abajo el estacion del tren."
