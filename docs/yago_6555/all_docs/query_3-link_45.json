        "text": "By Carlos Camargo\n\nSUCCESSES: Daniel Luzardo, artistically known worldwide as DaniLuz, is a Venezuelan recognized as one of the best realism tattoo artists. Currently, Daniel Luzardo is based in Los Angeles, California, as resident artist of the highly renowned “Ganga Tattoo Studio L.A.” whose founder and CEO “Joaquín Ganga”. Has revolutionized the tattoo industry taking the tattoo to new levels never seen before; Ganga is formed by a team with the best tattoo artists in the world in the “Dream Team” style, whose projects are disruptive in the industry and of which DaniLuz is a part. A clear example of this has been the recent project that was released on social networks for the famous American rapper “Post Malone”, who underwent a professional session under anesthesia, where 3 tattoos and a dental intervention were made adding diamonds to his teeth. Daniel has had the opportunity to leave his art on the singer’s leg by performing a wonderful piece in his style. In his career he has received multiple awards for his impeccable work in tattooing. In 2017 he won first place at the Barranquilla Tatto Fest for Best Black and Gray Design, while at the La Plata Tatto Convention he received the award for Best Black and Gray Design and Best Realism. During 2018, events held in different countries also awarded his art: First place at the Insk & Cutz Convention, Second place for best realism at Svenska Tatuering Massan, Best of the day and Best show at the Amsterdam Tatto Convention, recognition which many tattoo artists they dream of achieving and Daniel has achieved 2 times. DaniLuz is a clear example of a diamond in the rough that he has been able to polish through his dedication, focus and experience, becoming a great outstanding tattoo artist in the hyper-realistic technique worldwide. We are attentive to see much more of the projects of this character that is leaving the Latin name high through his majestic art.\n\nTOURISM: Luisa Santacruz promotes Colombian tourism like no other.
