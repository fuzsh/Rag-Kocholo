        "text": "President Kiir asked, “Where were they (Bor youth) when White Army invaded Bortown? Bor leaders are going to tell me and I am going to get anyone behind this (killing of civilians in UNMISS compound in Bortown).” At least someone has finally spoken to shift blame to someone else….I hope Justice Michael Makuei Lueth Kang, the minister of Information and Broadcasting in South Sudan, the chair of Greater Bor Community in South Sudan, and the first South Sudan minister to justify the killing using ‘we’ statement, is listening to President Kiir….It looks like Kiir and Makuei’s friendship is coming to an end or betraying and traumatic life is coming back to normal rationality!–via Athiaan Deng’s Facebook page\n\nBy Butrus Ajak, Asutralia\n\nThe baseless rhetoric getting strewed on the net that Bor community is being set up by ‘Bor officials’ is rubbish and unfounded. I will not prevaricate, but get down to business. The truth is Juba’s government bears blame for setting up Bor community and leave it to her own fate.\n\nBor community was, and still is made the Biblical sacrificial lamb for Republic of South Sudan (RSS) regardless of her altruistic and animatedly support for the government. In the year 91, political disagreement within the SPLA/M took a tribal dimension, several generations of Bor people, about ¾ of its population to be exact were slain helplessly. Notwithstanding, and the political fallout had nothing to do with Bor people. Arguably, Bhar-el–gazal people have different views on Bor people.\n\nI had had numerous heated deliberations at Footscray social gathering place with Bhar-el–gazal boys and all they said, was: “THAAN COL BOR, THAAN YE ARIOC, A PAN DEN PAL NUER KU BEER” Direct translation of this clause reads: ‘Bor community is coward community, it has left its territory to Nuer and Beer’. In addition, Muoranyar Maker, a rebel oriented Bhar-el–gazal gentleman I met on social network (Facebook) shared the same idea and the following are pukes he spewed about Bor community!\n\n“You guys (Bor Community) seem strong and aggressive on the web when your beloved community repeatedly risks undergoing major serious image distortion. You need this aggression beyond website boundaries and face your real enemy. You need to depend your homeland, at least to assure your ‘mothers their labour is never went in vain’. What is the acceptable justification do you give by having your populations protected elsewhere” Writes Muoranyar.\n\nThis paper is informed by this outrageous nomenclature Bhar-elgazal boys have on Bor community. As Bor son, I set out to write and challenge this misleading and groundless fustian. Bor community is never coward, keep reading! In the year 1991 Riek’s forces invaded Bor and uprooted civilians and occupied all towns right to Mangala in Central Equatoria. The situation reigned out of control, all the SPLA commanders were there and no one dared to face Riek’s forces. In fact most were even busy crossing borders to Uganda or Kenya. The SPLA/M Torit faction soldiers were demoralised as no one determined to take a lead. Son of Bor community, Commander Lazarus Kuol Manyang restored hope. He stood tall and did what a man could do in such dire situation. He sent out an order that asked all Bor soldiers and able bodies to report to his station urgently. In his opening speech he said:\n\n“We got to fight Riek’s marauders with will all our hearts and might, and that nobody should look back once in frontline or else, he would be that should remain back and leave the men to do the fight”.\n\nGen. Kuol led the fight, flanked by another Bor’s son commander Bior Ajang and our Upper Nile Dinka brother commander late George Athor Deng. Riek’s forces didn’t stand a chance. Actually, what happened then is a history and could be explained best by Riek and Bol Koang and the remnants of White Army in that particular showdown. Riek’s forces were culled by Bor community to only rise again in 2013,that Gen. Kuol has gotten old see how this fight is being fought as of now. If this is not bravery, what is it then? How would our mothers (Bor community mothers) who bore such sons be sorry for bearing soldiers of this splendid?\n\nJuba’s government is to blame for Bor destruction and mass displacement in the following ways:\n\nIn 2013 & 2014 respectively, Bor Community is caught up impromptu again. President Salva Kiir Mayardit being an autochthonous Dinka of Bhar-el–gazal went into political gridlock with his then deputy Dr. Riek Machar, a Nuer native. The political deadlock deepened and on that vendetta and fateful night of Dec, 15, 2013 hell got loose. Nuer civilians were reported by independent actors such as UNIMISS and Right groups that, Nuer were targeted and killed. This targeted killing was executed by presidential guard, infamously known as Tiger, and Tiger is populated by only Dinka Bhar-el–gazal, specifically where president hails. Bor Community was never part of what happened.\n\nLeadership stoush went on for several days in Juba until Riek slipped out of Juba. He rushed to his homeland and mobilised his year 91 militia known as White Army and Bor was invaded for the second time. About 5,000 or so were killed, and several thousand displaced. Awkwardly, president Kiir has not up to now uttered a word of condolence to the victims of his bad leadership!\n\nFrom the look of political things, it is crystal clear Juba’s government had an organised sinister plan about Bor community. Juba’s government installed Peter Gatdet Yaka, a top-class terrorist and political prostitute as head of division eight rights in the midst of Dinka Bor. And according to reliable sources, it is clear Gatdet was deliberately brought to spy and silence Bor Community on suspicion that Bor yearned to take Garang’s leadership back anytime if not given a close guard. The same government disarmed Bor community more than twice making the community much more susceptible to her lawless neighbours who remained armed to the brim as I write.\n\nThird, gov’t failed to aptly come for community’s rescue when Gen. Gatdet Yaka killed Gen. Ajak Yen and drove to Bor-town with armoured mounted vehicles shooting indiscriminately at anyone they saw in Bor-town. Juba’s gov’t failed again to militarily flank the enemy and take the war to Nuerland. Instead at the time Bor was captured president Kiir ordered Bor community generals both retired and active to go and liberate their town, forgetting the marauders are coming for his head, and seat. Majestically, Bor sons volunteered their souls to protect Kiir’s leadership, though general Jongroor and Chol didn’t make it back to Juba,this is what we in Bor call heroism! They have fallen decently. Even Bor sons who went for a visit from US, Australia and Canada never abstained to join; amongst them are Mac Achuek Mac (RIP), who left his young family in Australia and Akech Makuei Diing (RIP) left his young family in Canada. They took part in war and lost their souls depending elected leadership from being forcefully taken by force. This is what bravery is Muoranyar! All these forfeits were happening at watchful eyes of Bhar-el–ghazal sons and yet they remain denial to give credit where it belongs. Well, Bor got to claim it by themselves.\n\nBut questions remain, how would Juba’s government initiated war become Bor community war? How would Muoranyarand his community boys miss this glaring fact that the war started by Kiir and Riek and if they were to own it, then it is for Bhar-el–gazal and Nuer? I took this upon myself because Muoranayar and his boys avowal was never an isolated one, they have repeatedly been saying it and other communities have adopted it too, that Bor is coward. It is a white and flaccid lie. Bor is never been coward and this position can be attested by those who shared war trenches with Bo soldiers including Salva Kiir. During those tough years, it was common prevalence when war loomed, lots of officers from Bhar-el–ghazal felt sick and fighting could be postponed or assigned to some officers. Or officers were never of this sort. Such fearless Bor commanders dead and the living are as follows:\n\nCommander Majok Mac Aluong (RIP), commander Anyaar Apiu (RIP), commander Alier-wala (RIP), commander Geu Atherkuei (RIP), commander Deng Kudum (RIP), commander Mading Kudum (RIP) these are brothers, commander Abraham Jongroor (RIP),comrade Makuac Ajoot (RIP), commander Deng Aguang (RIP),commander Makor Lual (RIP), commander Awan Chol Lual (RIP),commander Akoi Maketh Deu (RIP),commander Mayen Akuak (RIP), commander Majok Ayom (RIP), commander Jok Reng (RIP),commander Arok Thon (RIP), commander George Gai Garang (RIP), commander Deng Leek Deng (RIP), commander Deng-akutnhom (RIP), commander Ayuen Mabior (RIP), commander Bior Ajang, commander Kuol Manyang, commander Peter Wal Athiu, commander Gabriel Jok Riak, commander Wilson Amoc-Arab aka Deng Kuoirot, commander Deng Garang Beny, commander Wuor Mabior,ncommander Mawut Wuoi, commander Atem Manyok Mabior, commander Mayen Deng Lual (Mayen-adit), commander Majak Agoot, commander Malual Ayom, commander Muhammad Sadiq aka Piliph Awuou Leek, commander Jok Ariing, commander Maker Thiong, commander Nyang Jook, commander Akech Loi, commander Garang Ngang Abui, commander Manyang Agook, commander Mathiang Aluong, commander Malony Akau, commander Alier Nhial, commander Atem Aguan gand list goes on. It is worth noting these were only officers and Bor foot soldiers were countless.\n\nIf coward is what Bor is,the above gentlemen could have never made names in the revolution history. Second, if Bor is that low, why was it vitally pertinent one of her own was rushed in at catch 22 periods, at the moment SPLA/SPLM scaffoldings were failing apart? This alone dictates Bor is not what Muoranyar and his boys want their readers and listeners to believe. Belief it or not, Bor Community is a linchpin of Kiir’s government and any other government that will come.\n\nIf this is not bravery, what is it then? How would our mothers (Bor community mothers) who bore such selfless sons be sorry for bearing soldiers of this caliber? I am making all these points to empathize our mothers have actually given birth to heroes and not the other way around. Just assume Bor community was fighting to liberate Bortown from Jallaba, the aforementioned heroes would have not fallen in the way they did. In fact, most of them fell liberating your towns. If anything, Bor community have contributed more than its population, this in turn says much more about Bor community’s bravery. If we were to fight Murle or even the entire Nuer in the way we took the revolution war up on ourselves, I tell you we would be in better position to secure and protect our territorial borders from any external aggression. There are a lot more pretty good evidences to suggest these men were a cut above the average soldiers.\n\nMessage to Bor leaders at home, and abroad.\n\nFirst thing first, Bor community has to separate powers. Monopoly of powers has destroyed our community and this has to stop forthwith. I understand those of Justice Makuei Lueth, Deng Dau and Ruei Puot are doubling up, as politicians and community representatives. This takes away community interest. Politicians are politicians and community has to be led by community representatives not politicians. Community representatives are people who will present common people interest.\n\nTough time calls for decisive action, this is to say Bor Community survivability has to be approached with foresight prudence and I think politicians have done all they could do and community is crumbling down. This is a ticklish moment, Bor Community has to recourse its political stance from Kiir’s government, this requires join forces from community representatives, youth leaders and politicians. This community cannot have it both ways, standing for a government and at the same time being labelled names by the same government it respects and protects. Bor community is being scornfully mocked as if the war was of her own. It doesn’t have to be this way!\n\nI know Bor community can be mocked because it has no numbers, but I am very sure we can swing, and bolster any elections results.For this, I am calling on our young leaders to act, especially our young leaders in the person of Madol Chie Anyang, the Bor Youth Leader in Australia, Deng Lueth MayomAyiik, the Bor youth leader in USA, and those at home.\n\nI suggest you really burry our differences deep and let’s start sending delegates home for sensitization and consultation with our people. Let’s consolidate and solidify our conformity as this will assist in denying our opportunists within and outside the wherewithal to downtrodden Bor community vulnerability.\n\nNuer, Murle, and Dinka Bor community have lived with vengeance against each other, particularly cattle rustling and no community has ever disposed each other. What is it this time? Juba’s government has invisible hand in Upper Nile’s predicament. Thanks Deng Lueth, I came across your following witty call for Bor community.\n\n“Dear Greater Bor People, by now, each and every one of you should have a very clear understanding of this conflict in South Sudan. It has affected us beyond description. However, we must remain resilient and do what spares our love ones who are still alive and the future of our community and country. Therefore, we must understand that:– We are part of Upper Nile region not Bar-el–ghazal region – Lou/Gaweer Nuer are our neighbors; we cannot scoop our land in Jonglei and move it elsewhere for safety. We must, together with all communities in Jonglei, find ways to peacefully co-exist together. SalvaKiir government does not care about Bor communities – chronic insecurity in Jonglei prior to the conflict and government was not doing enough to fight it”\n\nGood on ya comrade Deng Lueth. Precisely, what you have narrated is exactly what it is; all you need is to take it to another level. Bor youth leaders in diaspora have to have a task to dialogue with Nuer leadership and find some commons ground for our communities. It is time our people understand these egoistic politicians have, and are continuing destroying our communities. It is we the common men who are hit the hardest. Leadership can never be obtained through aggression or killing people so as to stay or usurp power.\n\nIn recap, Bor community survivability lies in her hand. Old politicians are not helping the escalating situation. I suggest Bor youth leaders take a lead and implement change, or else the ripple effects of this political strategy will be the nail in the coffin of Bor community. More and more mass migration is yet to come. This is a world of allies and this community cannot afford to have allies who never care about its existence. It was understandable when this community suffered because of Garang’s leadership in 90s, how about now?\n\nBhar–el–ghazal community needs to know you can’t have two at the same time.If you choose to stay put to power, you got to depend it then. Cowards is when you have four states at the time of budget allocation and have those who can’t persistently depend the gov’t when war strikes. It is about time Ngok Lual Yak community and Bor community can never accommodate Bhar-el–gazal mess anymore.\n\nFinally, by the look of shambolic politics in RSS, especially this loosely talk without ethics both in media and on the street, it is obvious citizens of congruent feeling with me will feel ashamed for doing everything they can to make sure the elected government stays in power until its tenure elapse.\n\nButrus Ajak is a health professional who resides and works in Australia. He holds MPH, MHP &BBus from various universities in Australia.\n\n——————-\n\nWe are on the right side of history: A response to Butrus Ajak’s call on the Bor Community to re-think her political alliances.\n\nDear brother Butrus Ajak,\n\nYour recent post is a violent departure from your usual sober approach to the crisis raging in our country. It seems like you have been roughed up in a bad way by someone from the Bhar El Gazel (BEG) region, which is the only context in which this outburst could be understood. Don’t be unmindful that every community has its own mentally strayed loose cannons, and you just happened to have been blown up, inadvertently, by ones of the BEG’s. This person’s opinion is nowhere near the general consensus in the said region. Let him bark until he runs out of steam and stupid zealotry.\n\nBut, since you’ve made some calls to the Bor Community to re-think her political alignments in the current conflict/political dispensations and the future ones, I think your post deserves some measured levels of response from somebody from the said community. Of late, the question as to why we’re standing shoulder-to-shoulder with a government that doesn’t seem to take our interest seriously has been dripping effortlessly from the tongues of some members of our community. I always take such a question as one of those random questions, which invariably stem from the war fatigues and general wariness, which is precipitated by the incompetent manner in which the war is being fought. I never really attach any importance to it until now.\n\nI read your writings somewhere before, and you appear quite knowledgeable, as someone whose views shouldn’t be dismissed with an air of arrogance or ignorance. The fact that you appear angry, upset, and visibly outraged is completely understandable. Our community has been served with the shortest end of the stick in this conflict. We’ve suffered immeasurably.\n\nBrother Ajak, in 1991, when Riek first challenged Dr. Garang militarily, the first thing he did was to send his White Army to Bor to wreck havocs. His mission succeeded when he managed to killed thousands of Dinka Bor civilians, loot their properties, and left the few surviving ones to fight against famine and diseases in the refugees’ camps, and internally displaced persons’ camps. Riek did this because he wanted to break Garang’s will, and he almost did.\n\nIn the movement, the SPLM/A, this was understood not as an attack on the Dinka Bor people alone, despite the fact that Dr. Garang came from Bor, but as an attack on the movement as whole. The SPLM/A responded as such, albeit belatedly, and Riek’s forces were forced out of Borland. I survived this onslaught as a young boy so when I talk, I talk from the ugly experiences of the past.\n\nThe people who came to defend Bor were not solely the Dinka Bor’s sons. It was the whole movement’s military machine who threw its weight behind Dinka Bor. For example, when Majak D’Agot was sent with Jesh El Amer (Red Army) to fight off the invading White Army, his force was almost homogeneously comprised of men from the BEG region, with a few from Equatoria, Dinka Bor, and Nuba mountain. This force was almost completely obliterated by the White Army in the muddy bushes of the then northern Bor. The force that came with Kuol Manyang, which finally liberated Bor on Dec. 12th, 1991, was equally comprised. It was the movement fighting the sellout in the person of Riek Machar.\n\nThis shows that despite our habitual silly tea place cheap talks, when the worse comes to worse, the Dinka of BEG will always stand with the Dinka Bor. All the data suggest that it is safe to make such a generalized conclusion.\n\nIn this conflict, let’s also pause, reflect, and understand that it is not the BEG region’s fight alone. The idea that that since the President comes from the BEG region, the fight should be viewed as a fight between those who hold the power and those who want to wrestle it out, with the rest of the country standing with its arms akimbo is silly. This President was elected by all of us, and any attempt to undo the majority’s will by force or otherwise should be resisted as an attack on our sovereignty.\n\nIt is immaterial whether Salva Kiir is the president or someone else is the president. To think that Warrap today should lead the resistant against Riek Machar is similar to that erroneous belief, which was prevalence in some quarters in 1991, that the Dinka Bor was the one with an axe to grind with Riek Machar. Dr. Garang was the legitimate leader of the movement and he had to be defended as such. Kiir is the legitimate leader of the country now, and on the similar basis he should be defended. Just as the Dinka Bor couldn’t defend Dr. Garang back then, the Twic Mayardit, where Kiir hails, isn’t in a better position to defend Kiir now. The sooner we realize this, the better.\n\nAbout the political alignment, you seem to insinuate that since the BEG region doesn’t care about Dinka Bor, it is time for the Dinka Bor to re-think her political alliances. You also seem to suggest that the defunct Upper Nile Region, which is where Dinka Bor has been mostly persecuted and prosecuted, is where the Dinka Bor’s security and political future lie. First, it has to be qualified whether or not the BEG region cares about the Dinka Bor interest. I am open to be convinced by a well-thought out argument, backed by a reasonable data, but so far, I haven’t seen any.\n\nThe present disfranchisement from the members of Dinka Bor is firmly rooted in an understandable anger triggered by a few unpalatable emotional outbursts from a few people who don’t know better from the BEG region. This childish, grotesque, and bigoted reasoning from a few BEG demagogues shouldn’t be used as the basis to fault the whole region. And honestly speaking, which region is devoid of uninformed and bigoted idiots? We’ve got our own loud-mouths who speak before they give themselves a chance to think, but their shortsighted views of others are never taken as the basis on which the whole community of Bor is viewed and judged.\n\nBrother Ajak, I am offended beyond fathoming that you would even hint at agreeing with Deng Lueth Mayom on his skewed views, which seem to erroneously insinuate that the Lou Nuer, Gawer, and other Upper Nile Nuer societies are our close brothers and that these are the ones we should form an alliance with. I read Deng’s call on the Dinka Bor to stand with Nuer, and I ignored that because we all know where Deng Lueth and cohorts stand since this conflict began, but are you too that gullible, to be swayed that easily? A day of reckoning will someday arrive for those who are now playing politics with the lives of our people. Our community is awash with Nyandeng’s apologists————those who are placing political expedient and jealousy before that which is right and just. These people will someday have their day in the court of public opinions and they will be condemned. There will be no Salva Kiir to stay their well deserved chastisement.\n\nThe Upper Nile, where Deng Lueth Mayom and his apologists find solace, is where we’ve repeated been persecuted. In 1991, it was the Upper Nuer societies who allied with Riek and attacked Bor in earnest, thus reducing it to ashes, both physically and emotionally. In the ongoing conflict, it was the same Upper Nile Nuer Societies who sounded the drums of war, and invaded the Borland, again, sending her children to the refugees’ camp, and internally displaced person’s camps. Now, is that what you want to form an alliance with? When did an antelope ever ran into a lion’s den and made it out a life? Where is this elusive brotherhood I keep hearing? If we can’t learn from history and experience, then what exactly are we going to learn from?\n\nBrother Ajak, when the ongoing murderous transaction was initiated, I was in Bor and I know what exactly happened. Let’s not allow political cheap talks to sway our opinions when we haven’t gathered enough information. It is fatal to toy around with one’s own security in times of moral crisis such as the one that we’ve found ourselves in.\n\nWhen the fight broke out in Juba, the first place where the Nuer began to avenge the alleged killings of their kith and kin in Juba was in Bor. After the night of Dec. 15th, 2013, some members of the Lou Nuer in Bor Town went to the home of their neighbors, two boys from Kongoor (Dinka Bor), and butchered them with machetes mercilessly. They then displayed their abused bodies outside the compound for their unsuspecting relatives to find in the morning. Then, Gadet switched sides in Panpandiar and butchered Ajak Ayen (Dinka Bor) and his body guards. He then sent his men to attack the town in earnest and sent us fleeing to the bushes. In the pursuing mayhem, hundreds of civilians, who took no part in the quarrels in Juba, were slain.\n\nBut that was not enough, the Nuer of the Greater Upper Nile mobilized in their thousands, and attacked Bor. Hundreds more civilians were killed in cold blood including the women in the church, and the patients in the hospital. They also went on a killing spree, butchering civilians in their huts in the surrounding villages. All these happened because these civilians were Dinka, and the Dinka was the one killing them in Juba. But that was not enough, after they were repulsed in Bor Town, they came back to Duk and maimed it. They abducted village chiefs in Duk; the fate of these traditional elders is yet to be elucidated. Their blood thirst hasn’t been quenched yet, and if given a chance, they will do what they did again, to the Dinka Bor civilians. Unless the word alliance has changed its meaning, I doubt if this is something you need to form an alliance with without being seen as dinning with the devil.\n\nYou also argue that Bor was not adequately defended when the war broke out. Yes, it is true, but understand that there was a national army, stationed in Panapandiar, in Bor. This force was enough to defend the region from any aggression, internal or otherwise. However, like the rest of the national army, it was mostly comprised of Nuer tribesmen. A fatal mistake was made when all the Nuer militia were integrated into the national army without political desensitization and training. However, this is a topic of another day. We can debate the pros and cons of it, but we will be digressing.\n\nAs a result, the massive defection of Nuer soldiers to Riek’s side left the country without a standing fighting force. The President and the Defense Ministry had to make do with what they had to defend the country. It was the reason why M7 of Uganda was called upon to defend his ally. And remember, when the late Abraham Jongroor went and chased Gadet from Bor, he only had five hundreds (500) men under his command. Do you know where these soldiers mostly came from? They definitely didn’t come from Bor. They mostly came from the BEG region. If it wasn’t because of these men’s bravery, a few civilians from Bor who are now sheltering in Guolyar, Awerial County, won’t have made it out of Bor. I personally won’t have made it out of my hiding place in the bushes of Kolnyang. And yet Deng Lueth Mayom, and you of late, want me to believe that the people who ensured my survival are supposed to be my enemies?\n\nHaving given you the reason why on a communal basis we can’t form any alliance with the Nuer societies backing Riek Machar, let me tell you the BIGGER reason why it is even a horrible idea to throw in our lots with Riek Machar. THE COUNTRY’S FUTURE. When the war of liberation began in Bor in 1983, thousands of our peasants joined the fight. The first nucleus of the SPLA’s fighting force was composed of men of Koriom battalion, which was mostly recruited from Bor. These men fought the hardest battles of the liberation war. They won some and lost some. Lots of them died and lots were disabled.\n\nThey were followed by the rest of the communities across South Sudan. Every time there was a depicit in the SPLA’s fighting force, Dr. Garang would always come back to Dinka Bor, and we never hesitated to produce men to fight the war. There were ‘Buluk ke Diak’ and other recruitment drives which yielded men who went on to liberate the country. I am sure you have some recollections of those recruitment drives across Borland. In terms of materials, we wasted grains and livestock to feed the army. In blood and materials, we’ve enormously invested in this country. Personally, I have lost three brothers, an uncle, and a nephew, all of them fell by the enemy’s bullets. Lots of other families from the Dinka Bor and across South Sudan can cite their loses. Expensively, we have invested in this country.\n\nWhen Riek rebelled in 1991, Southerners were at the verge of capturing Juba, a victory which could have allowed us to conclude the war in our favor. However, Riek stabbed us in the back, and formed an alliance with Bashir, our traditional enemy. Despites the setbacks, we pressed on until we brought forth the CPA. The last SPLA commander to fall before the guns went silent was Dhieu De Warabe. He was a Dinka Bor. Figuratively, the CPA was inked with his blood. It was a covenant not to be broken between the fallen and those who survived to enjoy the fruits of our struggle. Riek Machar was one of the first beneficiaries to enjoy the sweetness of these fruits, but Dhiew De Warabe wasn’t. Riek’s past deeds were forgiven, but hardly forgotten.\n\nBut Riek Machar’s appetite for betrayal is unquenchable so he is at it again. Instead of waiting for the voting boosts to be set up and opened, he took the shortest cut to leadership, and along the way, he has crushed lots of civilians, and put the nation’s future in peril. Riek Machar is bad for the country’s future because of his unstable political records, and any alliance with him will be an alliance against the country’s future.\n\nIn good conscience, given our enormous investment towards the effort to midwife this country, this is a costly undertaking we can’t afford to embark on, not now, not ever. We’ve come this far, and as a community, we can’t afford to queue on the wrong side of history. We ought always to remember and honor the memories of those fallen heroes such as Ajak Ayen, Jongroor Deng, and hundreds of Bor sons who have died making sure that this country has a future. So brother, they’ll call you coward because they have not the privilege of knowing their history, let them deny your contribution, but history, which is the best judge of our deeds, will always rebuke them.\n\n(Disclaimer.

Is Dr. Riek Machar is not guilty of two war’s crimes in Bor, and elsewhere in South Sudan. These crimes are terrible to weighs against Dr. Riek Machar were carried out against humanity in Bor. As well as many people know that Bor were victims of two war’s crimes in South Sudan.\n\nAlthough, the Sudan People Liberation Movement was upraised in Mading-Bor on May, 16, 1983, as well as an inspirations to Bor citizens to join the Movement overwhelmingly and kept it alive. The Movement was very strong an active because of culture in South Sudan and it was attempted to hijack by an arrival leaders in South Sudan to make it collapse, but it was resistance to survive.\n\nWhy Bor were victims of two war’s crimes in South Sudan? This is critical concern people can look at it, why Dr. Riek Machar always targets the civilians rather than deal with main government in term of politic.\n\nThere were two wars as many people know; one was started by Riek Machar against John Garang 1991, while the Southerners were fighting’s to achieve freedom of land against North.\n\nSecond war was started in Juba last year between Riek Machar and President Kiir Mayardit through frustrations of reform of the government. All these wars were affected Bor community deeply in South Sudan; while there was nothing connected the civilians in term of politic in the government.\n\nHere is Dr. Riek Machar footsteps in his political ideology was hammered Bor Community in many ways he was rebelled and went to his village to recruits his own tribal men and led them to Borland for attacks. He was a master minded of 1991 to massacre over 10,000 and unaccountable civilians in Bor were being abducted by Nuer militias.\n\nThe 1991 war was condemned as an “inhumanity act less in South Sudan by the world communities.” Who is a leader to do that to kill the innocent civilians if he/she was defeated in political? It was a planned war by Dr. Riek Machar Teny and his allies to fight John Garang and overtake the power in the Movement as his private agenda. This was a part of the Nasir-Faction left the Bor victims of senseless war.\n\nWhile, Dr. John Garang was struggling to plant a democratic of the whole Sudan in which the Southerners would have full representation in Khartoum; while Riek Machar wanted a quick independent of South Sudan in shortcut from Khartoum.\n\nTo look at it, who was making a good decision at that time? Think about it if Southerners were stays mum in their villages without taking up arms, and against North. I believe that the Khartoum couldn’t open a road to Southerners through the power sharing and independent state.\n\nIt isn’t easy to seek for the self-determination, while other side isn’t interesting to give a chance to other side. As well some people saying that, “If you looking for peace stand for your ground and there will be a chance for peace,” I think Dr. Garang was thinking that no shortcut of peace without exchanges of the fires. Only Former President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana was got independent state from British in 1957 without war, but more than that, no one in this world got independent state without struggles.\n\nI don’t think Dr. Riek Machar was struggles in same way like Kwame Nkrumah to bring the South Sudan out from North without exchange of the fires. I believe it was a dangerous plan to do so, and here how he was tried in 1997, he left to Khartoum, after he was defeated by the SPLA forces and he became a head of the Government in Khartoum backed South Sudan Defense Force (SSDF).\n\nAlong the lines, in 2000, he left Khartoum and formed a new militia, the Sudan People’s Defense Forces/Democratic Front (SPDF). He realized that the SPLA/M was nearly achieving a full independent from Khartoum, and then he changed his signal and rejoined the SPLA/M Party, as a Senior Commander to support Dr. John Garang during preparations of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2000.\n\nWell, Dr. Garang was welcomed Dr. Machar back to the Movement in Nairobi, Kenya in 2000, so that, they can deal with common threat. If all these conspiracies were made by Machar weren’t surprises some of the citizens in his political moves. I believe so people have low opinions to support Machar because of his political ideology.\n\nSecond, war on Sunday, December, 15, 2013 Dr. Riek Machar and President Kiir Mayardit were disagrees and fall apart in Juba. Riek Machar was escaped Juba and rebellion that left 2,500 civilians in Bor were kills and their properties were damaged in the towns.\n\nSome of Bor citizens were not aware about Riek Machar and Kiir Mayardit in Juba during outbreak of war. As well as same war still continues in three states of Upper Nile region of South Sudan. What Dr. Riek doing is called a nightmare because there will be no state of Nuer without other tribes in South Sudan.\n\nThe cause of fighting was started the months after Kiir Mayardit dismissed Riek Machar, whose supporters have taken up arms against the government. Kiir and Riek are longtime rivals from different view in politic, since they work together in Juba same government.\n\nThis is a big challenge South Sudan’s breathtaking descent into widespread conflict comes nearly three years after the nation was ushered into existence with help from the world communities after two decades of civil war since in 1983.\n\nIs this war is not a humiliation to a new nation under Kiir Mayardit and Riek Machar in 8years of serving. What kind of reform Dr. Riek Machar was missing in 8years, as he was a Vice-President of Republic of South Sudan he will do better, if he became a President of South Sudan.\n\nIs Dr. Riek Machar objective is to weaken the government if he kills the civilians in Bor and some communities in Upper Nile? What are his motivations why he always led the wars to Bor?\n\nFirst, some people were considered that the war of 1991 was affected Bor, because Garang was a leader of the Movement and some were saying that Garang came from Bor community, so Riek Machar was made a poor decision to lead a war to Bor and killed civilians.\n\nBesides, of the 1991 war the current violence was carried out by Riek Machar against Bor, while some of the citizens were presuming that both men from Bor including Minister of Defence Kuol Manyang Juuk and Minister of Information Broadcast Makuei Lueth Kang were stand firmly with Kiir Mayardit. Is that a problem Riek Machar was led a war to Bor and killed the innocent civilians last year.\n\nThese ministers were the long veterans and founders of the SPLA/M, and they have right to serve in the National Government of South Sudan like others who served in 8years.\n\nI don’t believe in that theory of evil act to attack the civilians in Bor, and created violence in the South Sudan. Dr. Riek Machar might think Kiir and his cabinet were the birds of same feathers, because of Dinka connection. That is not true idea from educated mind to look up and down.\n\nI believe some of the Nuer citizens were misused by Riek Machar in his poor plan of act less.\n\nIt is true nowadays there were some of Nuer was really educated in Nuer community and they can advise their own civilians not to fight a war of no boundaries. The vast majorities were misleading through evilness theory of Ngundeng Bong. Some people said that some of Nuer were motivated because to get wealth if they go to war of no boundaries.\n\nIs looting is a part of reform and liberation in the nation? This is over two decades from today since they were attacked Bor soil in 1991 and last year to get more resources like before.\n\nBor citizens were working hard to make their own lives through business and other things to make their own houses in the towns and villages. They were built their houses out of oil money.\n\nIt is an individual hard working within eight years and all their resources and lives were gone.\n\nHowever, to consider the idea of Former Commission of Bor County Maker Lual Kuol stated in his article on January after the mass killings in Bor. He mentioned that, “What will be a peaceful co-existence in Jonglei State after the mass killings of Bor citizens by the Nuer Ethnic group on 17th December 2013.” This is important idea to look at it and view it.\n\nI agree with him. These communities need to sit-down and find out what will be a solution between Lou-Nuer, Gaweer, and Dinka-Bor in Jonglei. I know so far Bor citizens will not truth Lou Nuer and Gaweer beyond three decades from now. The Nuer community should not destroy Bortown because the town is belonging to all of Jonglei citizens’ including them.\n\nA Former Commission was in Bortown the time General Gadet Yak carried out attack on December 17th 2013. Peter Gadet Yak was commander of Division-8 that was stationed in Panpandier village rebelled and led an attack in Bortown and some villages near to the town.\n\nThe attack was resulted into death of many Bor citizens and forced out over 200,000 people in town, and small villages. That was terrible killing after the White Army captured the Bortown in second attack they were destroy the town and kill the patients on their beds and rape old women, while they were sick.\n\nNo, any living human can do that to kill the patients on the beds and rape 75years old women and kill 24 laywomen in the church at time. That is called hate crime and madness acts less in history of South Sudan.\n\nIt is seemingly in places like Bor as historical city of South Sudan, conflict had become a part of life, except perhaps for a brief time after South Sudan was born. So, what will be solution to bring peace between the people of Bor and Nuer? People need to look at it seriously to end violence killings in the future.\n\nThese two wars destroy Bor community up to this date and thousands of lives and resources were gone through the Riek Machar frustration actless.\n\nManyok Mabiei is currently in Chicago, IL.

Claparede’.\n\nBut having said that, there certainly should be some sort of “dirty-facts-laundering” and “ugly-facts-burying” in the eyes of the “local public opinion” as well as in the eyes of the “international community public opinion” which equally tantamount in effect with the below adage:\n\n“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nIn an effort to search for a democratic quest and cause in Riek’s Tribal Insurgency war perpetuated against the people and the nation of South Sudanese that he wanted to badly lead and rule “democratically” as he has time and again claimed without any substantial or procedural democratic process and principles in rhetoric, actions, practices or vision, rule of law and order, respect for human inalienable rights for innocent fellow “demos” custodians of sovereignty and legitimate democratic rule.\n\nDr. Riek’s false claim of advancement of democratic quest through gun barrels by wagging indiscriminate an-all-out-tribal-war against all with savagery extermination of innocent civilians, children, elderly, disables, the sick and dissidents from his own tribe is one of the puzzles of the modern political history…\n\nNot only that, but Dr. Riek erroneous and adventurous political miscalculations has robbed South Sudanese by taking away the only glimpse of light of freedom and political stability that they have so far achieved in the aftermath of the darkest decades of history of social, economic and political marginalisation, exterminations and forced migration by successors regimes of Khartoum minority manipulative Jallaba against, African National communities in South Sudan…when on July 9th, 2011, thousands of people in the South Sudan chanted ‘freedom’ to celebrate the birth of youngest nation in the world. By leaders and ordinary people from different ethnic backgrounds.\n\nThe independence is not only for the victory against the exterminations and marginalisation but it indeed marks the ending of the 2.5 million people killed.\n\nHowever, the current Riek’s perpetual-tribal-insurgency has turned that hope of recovery and glimpse light of a new beginning in rebuilding and re-construction of very much broken and marginalised South Sudanese human-capital through social-economic human development and political empowerment… In addition, to continuing the furtherance of building democratic institutions that has been already established and enshrined into the constitution and validated through practical practices of political daily life, as evident in the conduct of (SPLM grass-roots Democratic National Convention, May 2005) and (Multi-Party National-general-free-and-fair democratic elections of, 2008), In the Republic of South Sudan as well as the (scheduled National free-and-fair general elections for, 2015), recently superseded by the SPLM party own internal grass-root bottom-up National convention democratic elections, that kicked off by starting the passing of party basic documents to legalise the SPLM registration prior to the conduct of National General Elections of, 2015 by structuring its own structures through democratic process mentioned above.\n\nThough there are myriads root causes of the current crisis in the Republic of South Sudan but the immediate causes that triggered the conflict that broke-out on 15th December, 2013, however, its roots could be traced back to May, 2008 when SPLM held its first ever National Convention to democratically elect its leadership..where all the party leadership position where all opened-up a grab in democratic contest. When Machar declared his intention to contest for the leadership of SPLM, creating tensions even among the military but the tensions where aborted. But Machar has renewed his ambitions to topple the president Kiir when he challenged him to step down from leadership in July 2013, and subsequently prompting the president to fire him from his position as VP in the Cabinet for insubordination. But with support from SPLM top leaders including, Pagan Amum and Rebecca Nyandeng, he shifted the power struggle into the SPLM Party leadership using the passing of the SPLM basic documents meetings as a new arena to challenge the president in the party leadership. On the 6th of December the pro Riek Machar group went public out-side-party- institutions by holding a press conference against president. On December 14, 2013, Machar announced to hold a public rally against, what he claimed abuse of power, by Kiir as a civic action to over-throw the president. On December 14th Machar, Amum and Rebecca Nyandeng boycotted NLC meeting but it wasn’t made clear to the public what was going to be their next move.\n\nHence until here, we can logically conclude based on the above stated facts that the conflict at first was political, administrative and constitutional within the government and the SPLM party, there is no ethnic dimension ‘in it’ ‘at all’ at it start:\n\nRiek rebellion in essence started as a coup d’état on the night of 15 December, 2013, then it down-graded itself into failed tribal coup d’état and finally turned itself into tribal insurgency in three states of Greater Upper Region. Apart from what many would like the world to believe for their own hidden political agendas, South Sudanese and expatriates alike.\n\nFurther, the following “escalation-lader-practicum” may help illustrate the cycle of build-up to the bottle-neck involving important episodes of the causes that fuelled tensions, from the memory of the time ” diary of events”:\n\n1/VP Riek Machar fired for political insubordination…challenging the president to step down.

CBS DC washington.cbslocal.com/2013/\n\n20/ Amb. Francis Deng repeated a statement from Kiir on Tuesday calling for an end to violence and ethnic targeting, and calling on Machar and the forces supporting him “to rise to the challenge of peace, unity and nation building.” CBS DC washington.cbslocal.com/2013/\n\nSUBSEQUENTLY International NGOS and local NGOS under UN PROTECTION STARTED COLLECTING CORPS AROUND THE BATTLE FIELDS OF 15-18 DEC. 2013. It was reported that they had collected 300 bodies and took them to JUBA TEACHING HOSPITAL.\n\nSubsequently the military clashes spread and stretch itself into Jonglei, Unity State and Upper Nile State….\n\nSubsequently slightly spreading to Western Equatoria and South of Central Equatoria Yei n Morobo.\n\nSubsequently the white-army mobilised to attack Juba through Bor.\n\nSubsequently mass massacres occurred at varying times in Akobo, Bor, Bentiu, Parieng, Panyang, Baailiet, Tharjac, Mayom, Tonj North, Tonj East, Twic West, Malakal, Tonja, Panykang, Kaka, Moyo, Akoka and GuilGuk…Subsequently and almost immediately the government started investigating/persecuting those suspected of committing war crimes…on the basis of individual responsibility for commission of a crime..\n\nNonetheless, tangible evident that justly disputes the argument that “there was no Coup d’état” is by simply exposing Dr. Riek through producing this media document that contain Dr. Riek own willfully-expressed words and intentions aiming at waging a war, as he disclosed that in an interview with the “Guardian Journal”.\n\nHere is the extracted statement by none other than Dr. Riek Machar from The Guardian Journal through an interview conducted in Rieks house in Juba by Simon Tisdall,\n\nwww.theguardian.com, Friday 5 July 2013 01.40 AEST :\n\n“Simon Tisdall in Juba”\n\n“Head lines”:\n\n“Riek Machar, the former rebel fighter ready for a new battle\n\nSouth Sudan’s vice-president has ambitions to topple his leader and transform his country”.\n\n“In his interview with the Guardian, Machar was highly critical of Kiir’s record as president and urged him to step down, thereby avoiding a leadership contest. But he also made plain that he was ready for a fight”.\n\nThis is an evident that Riek has plotted his failed coup d’état attempt with pre-meditated guilty mind on the night of 15th December 2013…\n\nFurthermore, to back up my claim above, we got two elements that prove that Riek committed the Coup d’état beyond reasonable doubt: these are prohibited conduct and guilty mind which is expressed as “actus non facit reum” and “nisi mens sit rea”.\n\nActus reus refers to the act that attract liability, the conduct that is the basis of offence. The mens rea refers to the notion of a guilty mind, that is, the criminal state of mind that must be proved to have accompanied the conduct of the individual.\n\nThe prove of guilty-criminal-mind “mens rea” is unequivocally apparent in the interview from Riek’s own words where INTENT and KNOWLEDGE consciously and willfully uttered, hence, the statement serves as a prove of “objective state” of mind that is so rare as a display of one’s own exposure of “criminal mind” as “opposed to subjective state of mind” which is always inferred-out from accused own words simply because intentions are latent unless confessed or materialized by disclosure as the case in the extracted interview. This is in addition to Riek’s own deeds and actions willfully-cared-out physically on the night of 15 December, 2013, that is characterized by “Criminal-Conduct” provoking a situation by firing-a-lethal-weapon, shooting-comrades-in-arms followed by an attempt of over-running the garrison at “Qaiada” as well as “Circumstances” such as moving to over-run the other garrisons of New-Site and Bilpam within Juba town almost simultaneously that same night…The “Consequences” of the above stated (Circumstances) surrounding an attempt to take-over the garrisons within the capital city Juba, the seat of the government of South Sudan on the night of 15th December, 2013, as per the intentions so far expressed in the extracted interview above, they would only had amounted in the toppling of the president as a “Consequence”, if it wasn’t resisted, curbed or deterred…Something that any reasonable person could had foreseen.\n\nWhether who was involved in the coup d’état apart from the two who fled to the bush together with Riek Machar, is a matter of a court to decide based on the evident that might be presented against anyone of those accused or the defenses that the accused might produce within the court proceedings …based on the presumption that all the accused are innocent until proven guilty…\n\nThis is needless of defining the apparent public confusion between indictment and verdict…and unprofessional media emotional noises around this matter.\n\nBut to shed more light to possible & reasonable Scenarios for the course of the political detainees (court-case), if the case was continue.\n\nHowever it is important that all must make a very important distinction between: Pre-trial indictment and fair trial court proceedings WHICH INVOLVES:\n\nThe institutions of justice and carrying on of legal proceedings against a person in accordance with judicial standards of due process and just and fair judicial standards, of both pre-trial phase and trial phase.\n\nIncluding testing or examining the gathered evident against the accused and its nature… With, presumption of innocence to the accused, the accused legal right to silence, right to a fair trial and right to a legal console.\n\nAnd more importantly the element of prove beyond reasonable doubts…Lack of which may lead to an outright judicial acquittance or vindication, based on the legal maxim known as the (benefits of doubts for the accused), that tantamount to the dismissal of the charges and the case altogether.\n\nOr alternatively, the accused be proven guilty through court proceeding and subsequent verdict proving the commission of a crime by the accused. This requires the following:\n\nThat the accused has pleaded guilty.\n\nOr that a tangible material evident has been produced by the prosecution as a sufficient proves beyond reasonable doubts.\n\nComing to the case of the Four political detainees the court has not reached any verdict condemning the Four for commission of any crime nor did the court acquitted them for being innocent from commission of any crime….\n\nA very important fundamental fact that surround their release is the fact that the case contain political nature that is associated with national security, national peace and well-being, as well as the president discretion constitutional powers pertaining to his right to achieve national interest through national reconciliation and peaceful settlement to the political crisis in the country.\n\nThe other important point that need to be careful observed is the fact that the victims of this crime are South Sudanese public and their interest of peace, security, order and stability including their immediate ultimate inalienable rights and freedom from fear of extermination, rape and forced displacements…That is the jeopardy and injury that the South Sudanese public has suffered and continue to suffer.\n\nOther national interests that has been compromised whether the Four are parts or not, are:\n\n1/ Set-back caused for the country in pursuing its progress towards nation-building that cement and forge common national-identity for South Sudanese people and therefore, creating harmony and embracing diversity among the national community different groups…\n\n2/ this is not to mention the fact that Riek have counter-acted this democratic process by trying to forcefully grab the leadership through the guns-barrels, something that can never be buried by distortion of facts surrounding the events.\n\n3/ impediment to national social-economic development and physical infrastructure present and future.\n\nTherefore, if the decision to withdraw the case and stops the court proceedings (without inappropriately and inaccurately jumping on pre-mature conclusions that the Four were proven guilty or that they were proven not guilty “empty propaganda” that is not supported by any substantive facts of judicial standards), for the Four political detainees is aimed at serving the public interest in bringing about the peace through political oversight not “judiciary” verdict , however, the decision so far should be seen as compatible, with judicial justice goals, “behind penalization objectives”, which aim at preserving and restoring public peace through justice, that the recent presidential decision is trying to achieve through other disciplinary approach which is “alternative justice through reconciliation conferencing ” that achieve justice through confession, remorse and forgiveness (pardoning), peace and reconciliation per se…\n\nFurthermore, those who might think that it is not just for the (Four accused) in the case that the court might have to find them innocent from commission of any crime or those who may argue that it is not fair for the victims of the crime (specifically the South Sudanese public who might have lost their loved ones) in the case that the court might prove them guilty of committing the charges set-against them.\n\nHowever, reasonable answer to that will be, the accused got every right to sue an individual or institution if they have any valid legal claim after the court verdict and consequent vindication or a-quittance from charges labeled against them reached through court verdict. And the same apply for the South Sudanese public the ultimate victims of these crises.\n\nComing back to Dr. Riek’s “democratic” revolution of twenty first century that aim to change legitimate democratically elected government through tribal insurgency without any substantive and procedural democratic procedures and principles that is characterized by summary extermination of innocent civilians based on their background including his own tribe dissidents who are butchered without any regard to international law and international humanitarian law principles of engagement in the battlefield…\n\nHow would any average and reasonable individual equate that to the simplest procedural and substantive democratic principles…?\n\nWhich entail in essence, that the leadership is not grabbed by the use of bullets but should be earned through free and fair democratic contestation process by ballots that is compatible with the principles of equal citizens, equal universal democratic rights, respect for inalienable natural-Devine-rights and freedom of choice that is free from intimidation, terrorization vandalism, “gang-thuggery”, victimization and gross-blood-carnages targeting the citizenry based on their back-ground and extermination of dissent clan-fellows…As well as, public incitation of hatred against certain fellow-citizens groups.\n\nOne is totally unable to logically discern how would all that conscience-shocking-barbarism and savagery “Kujur-cracy” relates to a democracy.\n\nNonetheless, Dr. Riek have also set-back South Sudan in its progress towards nation-building that cement and forge common national-identity for South Sudanese people and therefore, creating harmony and embracing diversity among the national community different groups…\n\nIn state, as a leader that dreams to be in a front-seat of the South-Sudanese affairs and therefore, being expected to articulate his democratization vision for South Sudan as well as formulating a vision of a common-good-future for all South Sudanese, he miserably and at will self-degenerated himself into some-what bloody-thirst indiscriminate killer on the bases of back-ground and targeting of his own fellow-tribe dissents in inhuman-savagery manner.\n\nHence, eroding the basic tenets of social-fabric that has always been there between South Sudanese national-communities, groups and individuals, cross-tribal-migrations, inter-marriages and social rapports between different peer groups among South Sudanese irrespective of tribe.\n\nBuilding of a national-state as well as advancement of democratic principles are not pursued through undemocratic means, especially when there are so many options and lack of circumstances that justify the doctrine of necessity…Simply because when you have a choice then you lose necessity defense.\n\nThus, democratic-inclusive-state that is based on, equal-citizenship with equal-democratic-universal-rights cannot be built through deliberately disseminating phrases “inciting” hatred against certain citizen groups or other national community individuals…AS WELL AS THROUGH waging TRIBAL INSURGENCY against the nation-state and pitting national-communities against one another…As such one failed to find any democratic-related-project instilled in Dr. Riek, undemocratic based political rhetoric. But indeed, what is palpably apparent is Riek’s own personal-political-ambitions leadership-mania quest wars…\n\nTherefore, I sincerely call upon the “silent millions” genuine South Sudanese compatriots to vigorously advocate and lobby for peace, restoration of confidence, peaceful co-existence among our national communities, reconciliation and national healing processes… We are one national community, one people and compatriots-forever in common-shared-destiny and common-shared-fate…No South Sudan without Shilluk, Blanda, Anyuak or Zande, Nuer or Latouka, Dinka, Baria or Nyanguara, Jur Lou, Indogo or Koko etc.\n\nLet’s embrace our diversity, OUR COMMON FUTURE, OUR COMMON GOOD THAT LIES IN THE POTENTIAL HUMAN RESOURCES OF OUR DIVERSE NATIONAL COMMUNITIES, LET US CHERISH FORGIVENESS IN LIVING LEGACY OF our GREAT LEADER NELSON MANDELA WHO MANAGED TO FORGIVE THREE HUNDRED YEARS INJUSTICE AND GRAVE INHUMAN TREATMENT AND ABOVE ALL OF THAT MANAGED TO UNITE THE VERY DIVIDED PEOPLE OF SOUTH AFRICA ALONG COLOUR AND RACE LINES TO BECOME AN INCLUSIVE DEMOCRATIC RAIN-BOW NATION LEAVING THE PAST WITH ALL ITS PAIN BEHIND THEIR BACKS BY WALKING TO THE FUTURE WITH LOVE AND TOGETHERNESS IN-SPITE OF ALL OF THAT….\n\nLet’s learn from “People of Rwanda aftermath-of-genocide-era who emerged very much Rwandans than they being attaching themselves to their “accidents of birth identity-backgrounds” being born into Tutsi or Huto lineage is none of anyone of them choice and cannot be made as something that should justify self-annihilation as one people of one common destiny and fate.\n\nThese experiences are African-home-ground solutions to the tensions borne-out-of-diverse-African-Communities and societies.\n\nThere is no way that we unleash-the-barbaric-hatred, dark-side-of-human-nature egoistic self-centred-mania too-far-too-long in the path of self-destruction through the abominable vicious cycle of revenge and avenge against our own fellow human brethren of sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, grand-fathers and grand-mothers, children and babies sick and disable…\n\nIt was Dr. John owns words that once said: If we used the maxim of an eye for an eye will all be blind….\n\nTherefore, the way forward is to cherish forgiveness, peace, and national healing process….And acknowledging the fact that those who have been slain are South Sudanese and those perpetrators are South Sudanese… And that the war is wagged against the South Sudanese…The victims are the average South Sudanese…So we are the victims and the monsters in this savagery carnage.\n\nMalong Muorwel…The author can be reached through e-mail: mmmal_2012@hotmail.com\n\nSOUTH SUDAN’S STRATEGIC PEACE PLAN: A PROPOSAL OF WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO END THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY\n\nBY AMER DHIEU\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt is clear that no one is going to win this current war. It is clear too that the more we keep fighting this war the more we lose lives of innocent citizens, elderly people, disables, women and children. It is also clear that this war is not just killing our people through bullets but also affecting our national economy, our international image, our regional cooperation and most importantly it is adversely dividing our national army and general public.\n\nOur nation has already fallen apart. It’s weakening. It has lost more than what it has in hand. The JUSTICE, LIBERTY AND PROSPERITY in our National Anthem have become meaningless. We are not practicing them. The hatred is taking its toll on South Sudanese communities.\n\nThey say in international relation that “war is the last resort” but to us it was the first resort. The question is: what is our last resort? What should be used as last resort instead? In my perspective, we have given war a chance, now let’s give peace a chance.\n\nThis proposal is a personal view of what should be done. You might disagree with me, but I encourage you to pen down your proposal too. Not that the government or rebel will use it but IT will give few people who will come across IT an idea of where our failing state should go next.\n\nVISION\n\nYou tell me. What else is the vision of peace strategic plan? It is simple: restore our national harmony, integrity, peace, justice, liberty and prosperity. Erase the stain of hatred, conflict, bloodshed and division. Bring back the confidence we lose in our government ability to sustain peace in the country.\n\nMISSION\n\nThe mission of peace strategic plan is to seek:\n\nStop ongoing war and urge leaders on both sides to come to the negotiating table\n\nRestore our national peace\n\nStrengthen our national economy\n\nRestore our international image\n\nHelp sustained our regional security and cooperation\n\nProvide South Sudanese citizen with a safe place to call home\n\nEncourage our 64 tribes to live in harmony: the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nYou ask me who is the enemy in South Sudan? I won’t tell you it is the rebel. I won’t even tell you it is the government. The enemy is the uneducated population, the enemy is the tribalist, the enemy is the divisionist, the enemy is the uncivilized, the enemy is the poor, the rich, the homeless, the millionaire, and the business people.\n\nAll these people do not know how to live together. They don’t know how to live in harmony. The Poor don’t know how to beg the rich; the rich don’t know how to give to the poor. The Nuer doesn’t know if Lotuho is a brother and a sister living next door in the same land. Murle doesn’t know if a Dinka and a Nuer also need cattle to survive. The Government and the Rebel don’t know if they are fighting for one position—be a leader and serve South Sudan’s people best interest. The whole country lives in a “DON’T KNOW” environment.\n\nThe purpose of this Strategic Peace Plan is to let this DON’T KNOW, KNOWS through the strategic peace plan. But how? Teach Nuer how to say “loi edi” in Dinka? Or to teach Kakwa how to say “male megwa” in Nuer? None of these is the strategic peace plan.\n\nSTRATEGIC PEACE PLAN A: DEMILITARIZATION OF SOUTH SUDANESE CAPITAL\n\nYou know how they mark around civilian’s suburbs in Juba with those ugly long guns. You know how the put army on high alert when there is disagreement in parliament. You know how government officials send their guards to haunt down people they have argument with.\n\nObjectives:\n\nMove all military barrack out of Juba to Buma.\n\nNo use of army personal guards either by government officials or other insecure citizen.\n\nNo use of a gun in civilians occupied suburbs.\n\nPLAN B: COMPULSORY PEACE TRAINING IN ALL TEN STATES\n\nEmmanuel Jal once said, “If there is any place in the world where people are most hungry and thirsty of education, it is South Sudan”. Not all educated people are wise. That is my belief but all educated people know how to construct something from nothing. It cannot always be something good but it can be peace from war. Peace training can give them skills to live in multicultural and diverse country. It can help them accept each other’s differences and embrace it.\n\nObjectives:\n\nCut national military budget by 10 percent and use it to build training centres in every county and Payam of all ten states.\n\nPeace education must be a compulsory subject throughout primary, secondary schools and colleges. May be universities too.\n\nSTRATEGIC PEACE PLAN C: RECONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL ORDER\n\nWe know in South Sudan the rich are going richer and poor are getting poorer. There is a huge gap between these socio-economic classes. Rich families are easy to gain public recognition, access quality health care, clean water, likely to get job than their poor counterparts and living a sustainable lives.\n\nObjectives:\n\nAll equal before law policy must be put in place.\n\nProvide funding for local Job agencies to help unemployed people find jobs.\n\nTo provide job training for unskilled person\n\nDepartment of Human Services to provide social security/welfare to support the poor and the unemployed person.\n\nEach adult being given 300 pound and a child with 150 pound every monthly.\n\nINTRODUCTION of effective taxation systems to pay for public schools and healthcare system\n\nSTRATEGIC PEACE PLAN D: EFFECTIVE FORM OF GOVERNMENT.\n\nNow this is where big problem is. If we don’t have very effective form of government we don’t have effective rules and laws governing the entire population in the country and whole nation will be like a flock of sheep with no shepherd. People can steal, people can kill, can be corrupt, and can do any illegal things imaginable because there is no effective government to enforce rules and regulations. Effective government consists of transparency in the system, it consists of democratic system, it consists respect for human rights and dignity, it consists of keeping law and order, it stands as a shield and source of every human needs and all living creatures in South Sudan.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo have effective government we must have effective and brainy technocrats behind every board member. To achieve this, it would be prudent for President Kiir not to run in the forthcoming general election. He should hand over the torch to a younger, educated and ‘brain-active’ candidate, whether from the SPLM ruling party or other parties or even an independent candidate, so long as that person would turn back the clock to doomsday of our beloved Republic.\n\n2015 cabinet must not include old Folks, especially those who have been in the cabinet before. They have spectacularly brought South Sudan to its knees. They are too rude and too corrupt. Cabinet must be made up of those with long vision, not short vision. Those who sees light ahead not “Dhuluma” Because if the cabinet members sees darkness ahead they only do things that will take country to darkness.\n\nNew military recruitment must take place and government must provide funding to send them abroad for Training. When they are fully trained they can come back and the current military can be put on reserved. This is because the current one only knows how to follow their bosses, how to protect (or advance the interest of) their own tribes instead of the nation. They don’t know that their main priority is, which is to protect the nation against foreign invasion and state sovereignty not the tribe.\n\nSystem! System! System out of all must be adjusted. System in all aspects. From work places, supreme and magistrate courts, in all public services. It must be fair, Democratic, transparent, equal and accessible by all persons living in South Sudan.\n\nGovernment must first serve the interest of all citizens before theirs. No child must be left homeless, uneducated and unnursed with care. That’s the ideal that all government officials must live up to or else they will risk being thrown out of office in no time by the general public whether they were democratically elected or not.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nAll media companies, bloggers and news editors must preach message of peace and development. All academicians, political analysts, activists and intellectuals must provide South Sudanese with new knowledge and strategies everyday on how to rule and keep the country going forward, not BACKWARD.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nwe have clearly read who is the enemy in South Sudan and to reduce those enemies we must immediately implement these strategic peace plans or any other plans you might comes up with. The responsibility to implement it is on your and my neck. We are the poorest and must learn how to beg the richest. We are the richest and we must learn how to give to the poorest. I am the Murle and I must know you the Nuer or Dinka also need your cattle in order to survive.\n\nIt us all who live in the environment of “don’t know” and it’s us all who need to live in the environment of knowing. GOD BLESSES SOUTH SUDAN!"
