C., July, 1880. Prof. Spencer F. Barrp, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.: Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith the first annual report of the operations of the Bureau of Ethnology. By act of Congress, an appropriation was made to continue researches in North American anthropology, the general direc- tion of which was confided to yourself. As chief executive officer of the Smithsonian Institution, you entrusted to me the immediate control of the affairs of the Bureau. This report, with its appended papers, is designed to exhibit the methods and results of my administration of this trust. If any measure 6f success has been attained, it is largely due to general instructions received from yourself and the advice you have ever patiently given me on all matters of importance. I am indebted to my assistants, whose labors are delineated in the report, for their industry, hearty co-operation, and en- thusiastic love of the science. Only through their zeal have your plans been executed. Much assistance has been rendered the Bureau by a large body of scientific men engaged in the study of anthropology, some of whose names have been mentioned in the report and accompanying papers, and others will be put on record when the subject-matter of their writings is fully published. I am, with respect, your obedient servant, J. W. POWELL. IlI-lV BNITHSONIAZ Skw YD AI LIBRARIES 7 i ; s = 5 w ‘ - Pons » PAGS er ©! Ey (COON Ey NS) REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR. Page.

By J. W. POWELL, Director. INTRODUCTORY. The exploration of the Colorado River of the West, begun in 1869 by authority of Congressional action, was by the same authority subsequently continued as the second division of the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Territories, and, finally, as the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region. By act of Congress of March 3, 1879, the various geological and geographical surveys existing at that time were discontin- ued and the United States Geological Survey was established. In all the earlier surveys anthropologic researches among the North American Indians were carried on. In that branch of the work finally designated as the Geographical and Geologi- cal Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region, such research con- stituted an important part of the work. In the act creating the Geological Survey, provision was made to continue work in this field under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, on the basis of the methods developed and materials collected by the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mount- ain Region. Under the authority of the act of Congress providing for the continuation of the work, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution intrusted its management to the former director of xI xII ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR the Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region, and a bureau of ethnology was thus practically organized. In the Annual Report of the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region for 1877, the following statement of the condition of the work at that time appears: ETHNOGRAPHIC WORK. During the same office season the ethnographic work was more thor- oughly organized, and the aid of a large number of volunteer assistants living throughout the country was secured. Mr. W. H. Dall, of the United States Coast Survey, prepared a paper on the tribes of Alaska, and edited other papers on certain tribes of Oregon and Washington Territory. He also superintended the construction of an ethnographic map to accompany his paper, including on it the latest geographic de- termination from all available sources. His long residence and extended scientific labors in that region peculiarly fitted him for the task, and he has made a valuable contribution both to ethnology and geography. With the same volume was published a paper on the habits and cus- toms of certain tribes of the State of Oregon and Washington Territory, prepared by the late Mr. George Gibbs while he was engaged in scien- tific work in that region for the government. The volume also contains a Niskwalli vocabulary with extended grammatic notes, the last great work of the lamented author. In addition to the map above mentioned and prepared by Mr. Dall, a second has been made, embracing the western portion of Washington Territory and the northern part of Oregon. The map includes the re- sults of the latest geographic information and is colored to show the distribution of Indian tribes, chiefly from notes and maps left by Mr. Gibbs. The Survey is indebted to the following gentlemen for valuable con- tributions to this volume: Gov. J. Furujelm, Lieut. E. De Meulen, Dr. Wm. F. Tolmie, and Rev. Father Mengarini. Mr. Stephen Powers, of Ohio, who has spent several years in the study of the Indians of California, had the year before been engaged to prepare a paper on that subject. In the mean time at my request he was employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to travel among these tribes for the purpose of making collections of Indian arts for the Inter- national Exhibition. This afforded him opportunity of more thoroughly accomplishing his work in the preparation of the above-mentioned paper. On his return the new material was incorporated with the old, and the whole has been printed. : At our earliest knowledge of the Indians of California they were di- vided into small tribes speaking diverse languages and belonging to radically different stocks, and the whole subject was one of great com- plexity and interest. “Mr. Powers has successfully unraveled the diffi- OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XH cult problems relating to the classification and affinities of a very large number of tribes, and his account of their habits and customs is of much interest. In the volume with his paper will be found a number of vocabularies collected by himself, Mr. George Gibbs, General George Crook, U.S. A., General W. B. Hazen, U.S. A., Lieut. Edward Ross, U.S. A., As- sistant Surgeon Thomas F. Azpell, U. S. A., Mr. Ezra Williams, Mr. J. R. Bartlett, Gov. J. Furujelm, Prof. F. L. O. Roehrig, Dr. William A. Gabb, Mr. H. B. Brown, Mr. Israel S. Diehl, Dr. Oscar Loew, Mr. Al- bert S. Gatschet, Mr. Livingston Stone, Mr. Adam Johnson, Mr. Buck- ingham Smith, Padre Aroyo, Rev. Father Gregory Mengarini, Padre Juan Comelias, Hon. Horatio Hale, Mr. Alexander 8. Taylor, Rev. An- tonio Timmeno, and Father Bonaventuré Sitjar. The volume is accompanied by a map of the State of California, com- piled from the latest official sources and colored to show the distribution of linguistic stocks. The Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, of Maryland, has been engaged for more than a year in the preparation of a grammar and dictionary of the Ponka language. His residence among these Indians as a missionary has fur- nished him favorable opportunity for the necessary studies, and he has pushed ferward the work with zeal and ability, his only hope of reward being a desire to make a contribution to science. Prof. Otis T. Mason, of Columbian College, has for the past year ren- dered the office much assistance in the study of the history and statistics of Indian tribes. On June 13, Brevet Lieut. Col. Garrick Mallery, U. 8. A., at the re- quest of the Secretary of the Interior, joined my corps under orders from the honorable Secretary of War, and since that time has been engaged in the study of the statistics and history of the Indians of the western portion of the United States. In April last, Mr. A. S. Gatschet was employed as a philologist to as- sist in the ethnographic work of this Survey. He had previously been engaged in the study of the languages of various North American tribes. In June last at the request of this office he was employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to collect certain statistics relating to the Indians of Oregon and Washington Territory, and is now in the field. His scien- tific reports have since that time been forwarded through the honorable Commissioner of Indian Affairs to this office. His work will be included in a volume now in course of preparation. Dr. H. C. Yarrow, U.S. A., now on duty at the Army Medical Museum, in Washington, has been engaged during the past year in the collection of material for a monograph on the customs and rites of sepulture. To aid him in this work circulars of inquiry have been widely circulated among ethnologists and other scholars throughout North America, and much material has been obtained which will Greatly supplement his own extended observations and researches. XIV ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR Many other gentlemen throughout the United States have rendered me valuable assistance in this department of investigation. Their labors will receive due acknowledgment at the proper time, but I must not fail to render my sincere thanks to these gentlemen, who have so cordially and efficiently co-operated with me in this work. A small volume, entitled “Introduction to the Study of Indian Lan- ~ guages,” has been prepared and published. This book is intended for distribution among collectors. In its preparation I have been greatly assisted by Prof. W. D. Whitney, the distinguished philologist of Yale College. To him I am indebted for that part relating to the representa- tion of the sounds of Indian languages; a work which could not be properly performed by any other than a profound scholar in this branch. I complete the statement of the office-work of the past season by men- tioning that a tentative classification of the linguistic families of the Indians of the United States has been prepared. This has been a work of great labor, to which I have devoted much of my own time, and in which I have received the assistance of several of the gentlemen above mentioned. In pursuing these ethnographic investigations it has been the endeavor as far as possible to produce results that would be of practical value in the administration of Indian affairs, and for this purpose especial atten- tion has been paid to vital statistics, to the discovery of linguistic affin- ities, the progress made by the Indians toward civilization, and the causes and remedies for the inevitable conflict that arises from the spread of civilization over a region previously inhabited by savages. I may be allowed to express the hope that our labors in this direction will not be void of such useful results. In 1878 no report of the Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region was published, as before its completion the question of reorganizing all of the surveys had been raised, but the work was continued by the same methods as in previous years. The operations of the Bureau of Ethnology during the past fiscal year will be briefly described. In the plan of organization two methods of operation are embraced : First. The prosecution of research by the direct employ- ment of scholars and specialists ; and Second. By inciting and guiding research immediately con- ducted by collaborators at work throughout the country. It has been the effort of the Bureau to prosecute work in the various branches of North American anthropology on a systematic plan, so that every important field should be culti- vated, limited only by the amount appropriated by Congress. OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XV With little exception all sound anthropologic investigation in the lower states of culture exhibited by tribes of men, as distinguished from nations, must have a firm foundation in language Customs, laws, governments, institutions, mytholo- gies, religions, and even arts can not be properly understood without a fundamental knowledge of the languages which ex- press the ideas and thoughts embodied therein. Actuated by these considerations prime attention has been given to language. It is not probable that there are many languages in North America entirely unknown, and in fact it is possible there are none; but of many of the known languages only short vocabu- laries have appeared. Except for languages entirely unknown, the time for the publication of short vocabularies has passed; they are no longer of value. The Bureau proposes hereafter to publish short vocabularies only in the exceptional cases mentioned above. The distribution of the Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages is resulting in the collection of a large series of chrestomathies, which it is believed will be worthy of publica- tion. It is also proposed to publish grammars and dictionaries when those have been thoroughly and carefully prepared. In each case it is deemed desirable to connect with the gram- mar and dictionary a body of literature designed as texts for reference in explaining the facts and principles of the lan- guage. These texts will be accompanied by interlinear transla- tions so arranged as greatly to facilitate the study of the chief grammatic characteristics BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NORTH AMERICAN PHILOLOGY, BY MR. J. C. PILLING. There is being prepared in the office a bibliography of North American languages. It was originally intended as a card catalogue for office use, but has gradually assumed propor- tions which seem to justify its publication. It is designed as an author’s catalogue, arranged alphabetically, and is to include XVI ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR titles of grammars, dictionaries, vocabularies, translations of the scriptures, hymnals, doctrinz christianze, tracts, school-books, etc., general discussions, and reviews when of sufficient import- ‘ance; in short, a catalogue of authors who have written in or upon any of the languages of North America, with a list of their works. It has been the aim in preparing this material to make not only full titles of all the works containing linguistics, but also to exhaust editions. Whether full titles of editions subsequent to the first will be printed will depend somewhat on the size of the volume it will make, there being at present about four thousand five hundred cards, probably about three thousand titles ; The bibliography is based on the library of the Director, but much time has been spent in various libraries, public and private, the more important being the Congressional, Boston Public, Boston Athenzeum, Harvard College, Congregational of Boston, Massachusetts Historical Society, American Anti- quarian Society of Worcester, the John Carter Brown at Provi- dence, the Watkinson at Hartford, and the American Bible Society at New York. It is hoped that Mr. Pilling may find opportunity to visit the principal libraries of New York and Philadelphia, especially those of the historical societies, before the work is printed. In addition to personal research, much correspondence has been carried on with the various missionaries and Indian agents throughout the United States and Canada, and with gentlemen who have written upon the subject, among whom are Dr. H. Rink, of Copenhagen, Dr. J. C. EK. Buschman, of Berlin, and the well-known bibliographers, Mr. J. Sabin, of New York, Hon. J. R. Bartlett, of Providence, and Senor Don J. G. Icazbalceta, of the City of Mexico. Mr. Pilling has not attempted to classify the material lin- guistically. That work has been left for a future publication, intended to embody the results of an attempt to classify the tribes of North America on the basis of language, and now in course of preparation by the Director. OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XVIL LINGUISTIC AND OTHER ANTHROPOLOGIC RESEARCHES, BY THE REV. J. OWEN DORSEY, For a number of years Mr. Dorsey has been engaged in investigations among a group of cognate Dakotan tribes em- bracing three languages: (legiha, spoken by the Ponkas and Omahas, with a closely related dialect of the same, spoken by the Kansas, Osage, and Kwapa tribes; the ,oiwere, spoken by the Iowa, Oto, and Missouri tribes; and the Hotcangara, spoken by the Winnebago. In July, 1878, he repaired to the Omaha reservation, in the neighborhood of which most of these languages are spoken, for the purpose of continuing his studies. Mr. Dorsey commenced the study of the (legiha in 1871, and has continued his researches in the group until the present time. He has collected a very large body of linguistic mate- rial, both in grammar and vocabulary, and when finally pub- lished a great contribution will be made to North American linguistics. These languages are excessively complex because of the synthetic characteristics of the verb, incorporated particles being used in an elaborate and complex scheme. In these languages six general classes of pronouns are found: 1st. The free personal. 2d. The incorporated personal. 3d. The demonstrative. 4th. The interrogative. 5th. The relative. 6th. The indefinite. One of the most interesting features of the language is found in the genders or particle classifiers. The genders or classifiers are animate and inanimate, and these are again divided into the standing, sitting, reclining, and moving; but in the Win- nebago the reclining and moving constitute but one class. They are suffixed to nouns, pronouns, and verbs. When nouns, ad- jectives, adverbs, and prepositions are used as predicants, i. ¢., I—A E XVIII ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR to perform the function of verbs, these classifiers are also suf- fixed. The classifiers point out with particularity the gender or class of the subject and object. When numerals are used “as nouns the classifiers are attached. In nouns and pronouns case functions are performed by an elaborate system of postpositions in conjunction. with the classi- fiers. The verbs are excessively complex by reason of the use of many incorporated particles to denote cause, manner, instru- ment, purpose, condition, time, etc. Voice, mode, and tense are not systematically differentiated in the morphology, but voices, modes, and tenses, and a great variety of adverbial qualifica- tions enter into the complex scheme of incorporated particles. Sixty-six sounds are found in the (egiha; sixty-two in the \\L2iwere; sixty-two in the Hotcangara; and the alphabet adopted by the Bureau is used successfully for their expression. While Mr. Dorsey has been prosecuting his linguistic studies among these tribes he has had abundant opportunity to carry on other branches of anthropologic research, and he has col- lected extensive and valuable materials on sociology, mythol- ogy, religion, arts, customs, ete His final publication of the (legiha will embrace a volume of literature made up of mythic tales, historical narratives, letters, etc., in the Indian, with inter- linear translations, a selection from which appears in the papers appended to this report. Another volume will be devoted to the grammar and a third to the dictionary. LINGUISTIC RESEARCHES, BY THE REV. S. R. RIGGS. In 1852 the Smithsonian Institution published a grammar and dictionary of the Dakota language prepared by Mr. Riggs. Since that time Mr. Riggs, assisted by his sons, A. L. and T L. Riggs, and by Mr. Williamson, has been steadily engaged in revising and enlarging the grammar and dictionary; and at the request of the Bureau he is also preparing a volume of Dakota literature as texts for illustration to the grammar and OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XIX dictionary. He is rapidly preparing this work for publication, and it will soon appear. The work of Mr. Riggs and that of Mr. Dorsey, mentioned, above, with the materials already published, will place the Dakotan languages on record more thoroughly than those of any other family in this country. The following is a table of the languages of this family now recognized by the Bureau: LANGUAGES OF THE DAKOTAN FAMILY. 1. Dakota (Sioux), in four dialects: (a) Mdéwaka*to®wa? and Waqpékute. (0) Waqpéto®wa? (Warpeton) and Sisito\"wa® (Sisseton). These two are about equivalent to the modern Isa*/yati (Santee). (ec) Ihank’to®wa\" (Yankton), including the Assiniboins. (d) Tito\"wa® (Teton). . Gégiha, in two (?) dialects: (a) Umaha® (Omaha), spoken by the Omahas and Ponkas. (b) Ugaqpa (Kwapa), spoken by the Kwapas, Osages, and Kansas. 3. yolwére, in two dialects: (a) gaiwére, spoken by the Otos and Missouris. (b) yoéyiwere, spoken by the Iowas. . Hotcaii/gara, spoken by the Winnebagos. 5. Namankaki (Mandan), in two dialects: (a) Mittitahankue. (b) Ruptari. . Hi¢atsa (Hidatsa), in two (?) dialects: (a) Hidatsa or Minnetaree. (b) Absaroka or Crow. 7. Tatelo, in Canada. 8. Kata/ba (Catawba), in South Carolina. bo _ =r) LINGUISTIC AND GENERAL RESEARCHES AMONG THE KLAMATH INDIANS, BY MR. A. 8S. GATSCHET. Of the Klamath language of Oregon there are two dialects— one spoken by the Indians of Klamath Lake and the other by the Modocs—constituting the Lutuami family of Hale and Gallatin. Mr. Gatschet has spent much time among these Indians, at their reservation and elsewhere, and has at the present time xx ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR in manuscript nearly ready for the printer a large body of Klamath literature, consisting of mythic, ethnic, and historic tales, a grammar and a dictionary. The stories were told by the Indians and recorded by himself, and constitute a valuable contribution to the subject. Some specimens will appear in the papers appended to this report. * The grammatic sketch treats of both dialects, which differ but slightly in grammar but more in vocabulary. The gram- mar is divided into three principal parts: Phonology, Mor- phology, and Syntax. In Phonology fifty different sounds are recognized, includ- ing simple and compound consonants, the vowels in different quantities, and the diphthongs. A characteristic feature of this language is described in explaining syllabic reduplication, which performs iterative and distributive functions. Reduplication for various pur- poses is found in most of the languages of North America. In the Nahuatl, Sahaptin, and Selish families it is most promi; nent. Mr. Gatschet’s researches will add materially to the knowledge of the functions of reduplication in tribal lan- ouages. The verbal inflection is comparatively simple, for in it the subject and object pronouns are not incorporated. In the verb Mr. Gatschet recognizes ten general forms, a part of which he designates as verbals, as follows: 1. Infinitive in -a. Durative in ota. Causative in -oga. Indefinite in -ash. Indefinite in -uish. Conditional in -asht. Desiderative in -ashtka. Intentional in -tki. Participle in -ank. 10. Past participle and verbal adjectives in -tko. Tense and mode inflection is very rudimentary and is mostly accomplished by the use of particles. The study of the pre- fixes and suffixes of derivation is one of the chief difficulties of N So) oS) CaO hoy CS OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. NXT the language, for they combine in clusters, and are not easily analyzed, and their functions are often obscure. The inflection of nouns by case endings and postpositions is rich in forms; that of the adjective and numeral less elaborate. Of the pronouns, only the demonstrative show a complexity of forms. Another feature of this language is found in verbs appended to certain numerals, and thus serving as numerical classifiers. These verbs express methods of counting and relate to form; that is, in each case they present the Indian in the act of counting objects of a particular form and placing them in groups of tens. The appended verbs used as classifiers signify to place, but in Indian languages we are not apt to find a word so highly differentiated as place, but in its stead a series of words with verbs and adverbs undifferentiated, each signifying to place, with a qualification, as I place upon, I lay alongside of, I stand up, by, etc. Thus we get classifiers attached to numerals in the Klamath, analogous to the classifiers attached to verbs, nouns, numerals, etc., in the Ponka, as mentioned above. These classifiers in Klamath are further discriminated as to form; but these form discriminations are the homologues of attitude discriminations in the Ponka, for the form determines the attitude. It is interesting to note how often in these lower languages _ attitude or form is woven into the grammatic structure. Per- haps this arises from a condition of expression imposed by the want of the verb éo be, so that when existence in place is to be affirmed, the verbs of attitude, 7. e., to stand, to sit, to lie, and sometimes to move, are used to predicate existence in place, and thus the mind comes habitually to consider all things as in the one or the other of these attitudes. The process of growth seems to be that verbs of attitude are primarily used to affirm existence in place until the habit of considering the attitude is established; thus participles of attitude are used with nouns, &c., and finally, worn down by the law of phonic change, for economy, they become classifying particles. ‘This XXII ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR view of the origin of classifying particles seems to be war- ranted by studies from a great variety of Indian sources. The syntactic portion is divided into four parts: Ist. On the predicative relation; 2d. On the objective relation; 3d. On the attributive relation; and the 4th. Exhibits the formation of simple and compound sen- tences, followed by notes on the incorporative tendency of the language, its rhetoric, figures, and idioms. The alphabet adopted by Mr. Gatschet differs slightly from that used by the Bureau, particularly in the modification of certain Roman characters and the introduction of one Greek character. This occurred from the fact that Mr. Gatschet’s material had been partly prepared prior to the adoption of the alphabet now in use. Mr. Gatschet has collected much valuable material relating to governmental and social institutions, mythology, religion, music, poetry, oratory, and other interesting matters. The body of Klamath literature, or otherwise the text previously mentioned, constitutes the basis of these investigations. STUDIES AMONG THE IROQUOIS, BY MRS. E. A. SMITH Mrs. Smith, of Jersey City, has undertaken to prepare a series of chrestomathies of the Iroquois language, and has already made much progress. Three of them are ready for the printer, and that on the Tuscarora language has been increased much beyond the limits at first established. She has also collected interesting material relating to the my- thology, habits, customs, &c., of these Indians, and her con- tributions will be interesting and important. WORK BY PROF. OTIS T. MASON. On the advent of the white man in America a great number of tribes were found. Fora variety of reasons the nomenclature OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XXII of these tribes became excessively complex. Names were greatly multiplied for each tribe and a single name was often inconsistently applied to different tribes. Several important rea- sons conspired to bring about this complex state of synonymy: Ist. A great number of languages were spoken, and ofttimes the first names obtained for tribes were not the names used by themselves, but the names by which they were known to some other tribes. 2d. The governmental organization of the Indians was not understood, and the names for gentes, tribes, and confederacies were confounded. 3d. The advancing occupancy of the country by white men changed the habitat of the Indians, and in their migrations from point to point their names were changed. ° Under these circumstances the nomenclature of Indian tribes became ponderous and the synonymy complex. To unravel this synonymy is a task of great magnitude. arly in the fiscal year the materials already collected on this subject were turned over to Professor Mason and clerical assistance given him, and he has prepared a card catalogue of North American tribes, exhibiting the synonymy, for use in the office. This is being constantly revised and enlarged, and will eventually be published Professor Mason is also engaged in editing a grammar and dictionary of the Chata language, by the late Rev. Cyrus Bying- ton, the manuscript of which was by Mrs. Byington turned over to the Bureau of Ethnology. The dictionary is Chata- English, and Professor Mason has prepared an English-Chata of about ten thousand words. He has also undertaken to enlarge the grammar by a further study of the language among the Indians themselves. THE STUDY OF GESTURE SPEECH, BY BREVET LIEUT. COL. GAR- RICK MALLERY, U. S. A. The growth of the languages of civilized peoples in their later stages may be learned from the study of recorded litera- XXIV ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR ture; and by comparative methods many interesting facts may be discovered pertaining to periods anterior to the develop- ment of writing. In the study of peoples who have not passed beyond the tribal condition, laws of linguistic growth anterior to the writ- ten stage may be discovered. Thus, by the study of the lan- guages of tribes and the languages of nations, the methods and laws of development are discovered from the low condi- tion represented by the most savage tribe to the highest condi- tion existing in the speech of civilized man. But there is a development of language anterior to this—a prehistoric condi- tion—of profound interest to the scholar, because in it the beginnings of language—the first steps in the organization of articulate speech—are involved. On this prehistoric stage, light is thrown from four sources: Ist. Infant speech, in which the development of the language of the race is epitomized. 2d. Gesture speech, which, among tribal peoples, never passes beyond the first stages of linguistic growth; and these stages are probably homologous to the earlier stages of oral speech. 3d. Picture writing, in which we again find some of the characteristics of prehistoric speech illustrated. 4th. It may be possible to learn something of the elements of which articulate speech is compounded by studying the in- articulate language of the lower animals. The traits of gesture speech that seem to illustrate the con- dition of prehistoric oral language are found in the synthetic character of its signs. The parts of speech are not differen- tiated, and the sentence is not integrated; and this character- istic is more marked than in that of the lowest oral language yet studied. For this reason the facts of gesture speech con- stitute an important factor in the philosophy of language. Doubtless, care must be exercised in its use because of the advanced mental condition of the people who thus express their thought, but with due caution it may be advantageously used. In itself, independent of its relations to oral speech, the subject is of great interest. OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XXV In taking up this subject for original investigation, valuable published matter was found for comparison with that obtained by Colonel Mallery. His opportunities for collecting materials from the Indians themselves were abundant, as delegations of various tribes are visiting Washington from time to time, by which the information obtained during his travels was supple- mented. Again, the method of investigation by the assistance of a number of collaborators is well illustrated in this work, and contributions from various sources were made to the materials for study. The methods of obtaining these contributions will be more fully explained hereafter. One of the papers ap- pended to this report was prepared by Colonel Mallery and relates to this subject. During the continuance of the Survey of the Colorado River, and of the Rocky Mountain Region, the Director and _ his assistants made large collections of pictographs. When Colonel Mallery joined the corps these collections were turned over to him for more careful study. From various sources these pic- tographs are rapidly accumulating, and now the subject is assuming large proportions, and valuable results are expected. An interesting relation between gesture speech and picto- graphy consists in the discovery that to the delineation of nat- ural objects is added the representation of gesture signs Materials in America are very abandant, and the prehistoric materials may be studied in the light given by the practices now found among Indian tribes. STUDIES IN CENTRAL AMERICAN PICTURE WRITING, BY PROF. E. 8. HOLDEN. In Central America and Mexico, picture writing had pro- gressed to a stage far in advance of anything discovered to the northward. Some of the most interesting of these are the rock inscriptions of Yucatan, Copan, Palenque, and other ruins of Central America. Professor Holden has devoted much time to the study of XXVI ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR these inscriptions, for the purpose of discovering the character- istics of the pictographic method and deciphering the records, and the discoveries made by him are of great interest. The Bureau has given him clerical assistance and such other aid as has been found possible, and a paper by him on this sub- ject appears with this volume. THE STUDY OF MORTUARY CUSTOMS, BY DR. H. C. YARROW. The tribes of North America do not constitute a homoge- neous people. In fact, more than seventy distinct linguistic stocks are discovered, and these are again divided by important distinctions of language. Among these tribes varying stages of culture have been reached, and these varying stages are ex- hibited in their habits and customs; and in a territory of such vast extent the physical environment affecting culture and cus- toms is of great variety. Forest lands on the one hand, prairie lands on the other, unbroken plains and regions of rugged mountains, the cold, naked, desolate shores of sea and lake at the north and the dense chaparral of the torrid south, the valleys of quiet rivers and the cliffs and gorges of the canon land—in all a great diversity of physical features are found, imposing diverse conditions for obtaining subsistence, in means and methods of house-building, creating diverse wants and fur- nishing diverse ways for their supply. Through diversities of languages and diversities of environment, diversity of tradi- tions and diversity of institutions have been produced; so: that in many important respects one tribe is never the counterpart of another. These diversities have important limitations in the unity of the human race and the social, mental, and moral homogeneity that has everywhere controlled the progress of culture. The way of human progress is one road, though wide. From the interesting field of research cultivated by Dr. Yar- row an abundant harvest will be gathered. The materials already accumulated are large, and are steadily increasing through his vigorous work. These materials constitute some- OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XXVII thing more than a record of quaint customs and abhorrent rites in which morbid curiosity may revel. In them we find the evidences of traits of character and lines of thought that yet exist and profoundly influence civilization. Passions in the highest culture deemed most sacred—the love of husband and wife, parent and child, and kith and kin, tempering, beautify- ing, and purifying social life and culminating at death, have their origin far back in the early history of the race and leaven the society of savagery and civilization alike At either end .of the line bereavement by death tears the heart and mortuary customs are symbols of mourning. The mystery which broods over the abbey where lie the bones of king and bishop, gathers over the ossuary where lie the bones of chief and shamin; for the same longing to solve the mysteries of life and death, the same yearning for a future life, the same awe of powers more than human, exist alike in the mind of the savage and the sage. By such investigations we learn the history of culture in these important branches, and in a paper appended to this report Dr. Yarrow presents some of the results of his studies. INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO CESSIONS OF LAND BY INDIAN TRIBES TO THE UNITED STATES, BY C. C. ROYCE. When civilized man first came to America the continent was partially occupied by savage tribes, who obtained subsistence by hunting, by fishing, by gathering vegetal products, and by rude garden culture in cultivating small patches of ground. Semi-nomadic occupancy for such purposes was their tenure to the soil. On the organization of the present government such theories of natural law were entertained that even this imperfect occu- pancy was held to be sufficient title. Publicists, jurists, and statesmen agreed that no portion of the waste of lands between the oceans could be acquired for the homes of the incoming civilized men but by purchase or conquest in just war. These theories were most potent in establishing practical relations, XXVIUI ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR and controlling governmental dealings with Indian tribes. They were adjudged to be dependent domestic nations. Under this theory a system of Indian affairs grew up, the history*of which, notwithstanding mistakes and innumerable personal wrongs, yet demonstrates the justice inherent in the public sentiment of the nation from its organization to the present time. The difficulties subsisting in the adjustment of rights be- tween savage and civilized peoples are multiform and complex. Ofttimes the virtues of one condition are the crimes of the: other; happiness is misery; justice, injustice. Thus, when the civilized man would do the best, he gave the most offense. Under such circumstances it was impossible for wisdom and _ justice combined to avert conflict. One chapter in the history of Indian affairs in America is a doleful tale of petty but costly and cruel wars; but there are other chapters more pleasant to contemplate. The attempts to educate the Indians and teach them the ways of civilization have been many; much labor has been given, much treasure expended. While to a large extent all of these efforts have disappointed their enthusiastic promoters, yet good has been done, but rather by the personal labors of missionaries, teachers, and frontiersmen associating with In- dians in their own land than by institutions organized and supported by wealth and benevolence not immediately in con- tact with savagery. The great boon to the savage tribes of this country, unrec- ognized by themselves, and, to a large extent, unrecognized by civilized men, has been the presence of civilization, which, under the laws of acculturation, has irresistibly improved their culture by substituting new and civilized for old and savage arts, new for old customs—in short, transforming savage into civilized life. These unpremeditated civilizing influences have had a marked effect. The great body of the Indians of North America have passed through stages of culture in the last hundred years achieved by our Anglo-Saxon ancestors only by the slow course of events through a thousand years. The Indians of the continent have not greatly diminished OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XXIX in numbers, and the tribes longest in contact with civilization are increasing. The whole body of Indians is making rapid progress toward a higher culture, notwithstanding the petty conflicts yet occurring where the relations of the Indian tribes to our civilization have not yet been adjusted by the adoption upon their part of the first conditions of a higher life. The part which the General Government, representing pub- lic sentiment, has done in the extinguishment of the vague Indian title to lands in the granting to them of lands for civ- ilized homes on reservations and in severalty, in the establish- ment and support of schools, in the endeavors to teach them agriculture and other industrial arts—in these and many other ways justice and beneficence have been shown. Thus the history of the tribes of America from savagery to civilization is a history of three: First. The history of acculturation—the effect of the pres- ence of civilization upon savagery. Second. The history of Indian wars that have arisen in part from the crimes and in part from the ignorance of either party. Third. The history of civil Indian affairs. This last is di- vided into a number of parts: Ist. The extinguishment of the Indian title. 2d. The gathering of Indians upon reservations. 3d. The instrumentalities used to teach the Indians civilized industries; and 4th. The establishment and operation of schools. From the organization of the Government to the present time these branches of Indian affairs have been in operation; lands have been bought and bought again; Indian tribes have been moved and moved. again; reservations have been estab- lished and broken up. The Government has sought to give lands in severalty to the Indians from time to time along the whole course of the history of Indian affairs. very experi- ment to teach the Indians the industries of civilization that could be devised has been tried, and from all of these there has resulted a mixture of failure and success. A review of the century’s history abundantly demonstrates that there is no short road to justice and peace; but a glance XXX ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR at the present state of affairs exhibits the fact that these tribal communities will speedily be absorbed in the citizenship of the republic. No new method is to be adopted; the work is almost done; patient and persistent effort for a short future like that of the long past will accomplish all. It remains for us but to perfect the work wisely begun by the founders of the Government. The industries and social institutions of the pristine Indians have largely been destroyed, and they are groping their way to civilized life. To the full accomplishment of this, three things are necessary: Ist. The organization of the civilized family, with its rules of inheritance in lineal descent. 2d. The civilized tenure of property in severalty must be substituted for communal property. 3d. The English language must be acquired, that the thoughts and ways of civilization may be understood. To the history of Indian affairs much time has been given by the various members of the Bureau of Ethnology. One of the more important of these studies is that prosecuted by Mr. Royce in preparing a history of the cessions of lands by Indian tribes to the Government of the United States. A paper by him appended to this report illustrates the character of these investigations. EXPLORATIONS BY MR. JAMES STEVENSON. In the early exploration of the southwestern portion of the United States by Spanish travelers and conquerors, about sixty pueblos were discovered. These pueblos were communal vil- lages, with architecture in untooled stone. In the conquest about half of the pueblos were destroyed. Thirty-one now remain, and two of these are across the line, on Mexican terri- tory. The ruins of the pueblos yet remain, and some of them have been identified. The Navajos, composed of a group of tribes of the Atha- bascan family, and the Coaninis, who live on the south side of OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XXXI the Grand Cajion of the Colorado, are now known to be the people, or part of them at least, who were driven from the pueblos. In addition to the ruins that have been made in historic times, others are found scattered throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Southern California, Utah, and Colorado. Whether the ancient inhabitants of these older ruins are represented by any of the tribes who now occupy the territory is not known. These pueblo people were not homogeneous. Among the pueblos now known at least five linguistic families are repre- sented, but in their study a somewhat homogeneous stage of culture is presented. In a general way the earlier or older ruins represent very rude structures, and the progress of development from the earlier to the later exhibits two classes of interesting facts. The structures gradually increase in size and improve in archi- tecture. As the sites for new villages were selected, more easily defensible positions were chosen. The cliff dwellings thus belong to the later stage. From the organization of the exploration of the Colorado River to the present time, the pueblos yet inhabited, as well as those in ruins, have been a constant subject of study, and on the organization of the Bureau much valuable matter had already been collected. Early in the fiscal year a party was organized to continue explorations in this field, and placed under the direction of Mr. James Stevenson. The party left Washington on the first of August last. Mr. Frank H. Cushing, of the Smithsonian Institution, and Mr. J. K. Hillers, photographer of the Bureau, with a number of general assistants, accompanied Mr. Stevenson. The party remained in the field until early winter, studying the ruins and making large and valuable collections of pottery, stone imple- ments, etc., and Mr. Hillers succeeded in making an excellent suite of photographs. When Mr. Stevenson returned with his party to Washington, Mr. Cushing remained at Zuni to study the language, my- thology, sociology, and art of that the most interesting pueblo. An illustrated catalogue of the collections made by Mr. Steven- XXXII ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR son has been printed. It was intended to form an appendix to this report, but the volume has grown to sucha size that it is thought best to issue it with the next report. RESEARCHES AMONG THE WINTUNS, BY J. W. POWELL. During the fall the Director made an expedition into North- _ ern California for the purpose of studying the Wintuns. Much linguistic, sociologic, and technologie material was collected, and more thorough anthropologic researches initiated among a series of tribes heretofore neglected. THE PREPARATION OF MANUALS FOR USE IN AMERICAN RESEARCH. In the second plan of operations adopted by the Bureau, that of promoting the researches of collaborators, aid in publi- cation and, to some extent, in preparation of scientific papers, has been given, and by various ways new investigations and lines of research have been initiated. For this latter purpose a series of manuals with elementary discussions and schedules of interrogatories have been prepared. The first is entitled Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages, by J. W. Powell. This has been widely distributed throughout North America, and the collection of a large body of linguistic material has resulted therefrom. A second volume of this character is entitled Introduction to the Study of Mortuary Customs, by Dr. H. C. Yarrow. This also has been widely circulated with abundant success. A third hand-book of the:same character is entitled Intro- duction to the Study of Sign Language, by Colonel Mallery. This was circulated in like manner with like results. A second edition of the Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages, enlarged to meet the advanced wants of the time, has been prepared. OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY. XXXIII The papers by Dr. Yarrow and Colonel Mallery, and the catalogue of manuscripts in the Bureau, prepared by Mr. Pill- ing, appended to this volume, will illustrate the value of these agencies. It is proposed in the near future to prepare similar volumes, as follows: Introduction to the Study of Medicine Practices of the North American Indians ; Introduction to the Study of the Tribal Governments of North America ; Introduction to the Study of North American Mythology. These additional manuals are nearly ready. Still others are projected, and it is hoped that the field of North American anthropology will be entirely covered by them. The series will then be systematically combined in a Manual of Anthro- pology for use in North America. SYSTEMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN TRIBES. There is in course of preparation by the Bureau a linguistic classification of North American tribes, with an atlas exhibit- ing their priscan homes, or the regions inhabited by them at the time they were discovered by white men. The foregoing sketch of the Bureau, for the first fiscal year of its existence, is designed to set forth the plan on which it is organized and the methods of research adopted, and the papers appended thereto will exhibit the measure of success attained.

ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE, AS EXHIBITED IN THE SPECIALIZATION OF THE GRAMMATIC PROCESSES, THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH, AND THE INTEGRATION OF THE SENTENCE; FROM A STUDY OF INDIAN LANGUAGES.

A ' ‘ vont - 5 a reas ai » ‘ = 5 Fy : ue. # 5 FE ? , ’ s a = ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE, AS EXHIBITED IN THE SPECIALIZATION OF THE GRAMMATIC PROCESSES, THE DIFFER- ENTIATION OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH, AND THE INTEGRATION OF THE SENTENCE; FROM A STUDY OF INDIAN LANGUAGES. By J. W. PowELt. Possible ideas and thoughts are vast in number. A distinct word for every distinct idea and thought would require a vast vocabulary. The problem in language is to express many ideas and thoughts with com- paratively few words. Again, in the evolution of any language, progress is from a condition where few ideas are expressed by a few words to a higher, where many ideas are expressed by the use of many words; but the number of all possible ideas or thoughts expressed is increased greatly out of pro- portion with the increase of the number of words. And still again, in all of those languages which have been most thor- oughly studied, and by inference in all languages, it appears that the few original words used in any language remain as the elements for the greater number finally used. In the evolution of a language the intro- duction of absolutely new material is a comparatively rare phenome- non. The old material is combined and modified in many ways to form the new. How has the small stock of words found as the basis of a language been thus combined and modified ? The way in which the old materials have been used gives rise to what will here be denominated THE GRAMMATIC PROCESSES. I._THE PROCESS BY COMBINATION. Two or more words may be united to form a new one, or to perform the office of a new one, and four methods or stages of combination may be noted. a. By juxtaposition, where the two words are placed together and yet remain as distinct words. ‘This method is illustrated in Chinese, where the words in the combination when taken alone seldom give a clew to their meaning when placed together. b. By compounding, where two words are made into one, in which case the original elements of the new word remain in an unmodified condition, as in house-top, rain-bow, tell-tale. 3 4 ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. c. By agglutination, in which case one or more of the elements enter- ing into combination to form the new word is somewhat changed—the elements are fused together. Yet this modification is not so great as to essentially obscure the primitive words, as in truthful, where we easily recognize the original words truth and full; and holiday, in which holy and day are recognized. f d. By inflection. Here one or more of the elements entering into the compound has been so changed that it can scarcely be recognized. There is a constant tendency to economy in speech by which words are gradually shortened as they are spoken by generation after generation. In those words which are combinations of others there are certain ele- ments that wear out more rapidly than others. Where some particular word is combined with many other different words the tendency to modify by wear this oft-used element is great. This is more especially the case where the combined word is used in certain categories of com- binations, as where particular words are used to denote tense in the verb; thus, did may be used in combination with a verb to denote past time until it is worn down to the sound of d. The same wear occurs where particular words are used to form cases in nouns, and a variety of illustrations might be given. These categories constitute conjugations and declensions, and for convenience such combinations may be called paradigmatic. Then the oft-repeated elements of paradigmatic combina- tions are apt to become excessively worn and modified, so that the primi- tive words or themes to which they are attached seem to be but slightly changed by the addition. Under these circumstances combination is called inflection. As a morphologic process, no well-defined plane of demarkation be- tween these four methods of combination can be drawn, as one runs into another ; but, in general, words may be said to be juxtaposed when two words being placed together the combination performs the function of a new word, while in form the two words remain separate. Words may be said to be compound when two or more words are com- bined to form one, no change being made in either. Words may be said to be agglutinated when the elementary words are changed but slightly, i. é., only to the extent that their original forms are not greatly ob- secured; and words may be said to be inflected when in the combination the oft-repeated element or formative part has been so changed that its origin is obscured. These inflections are used chiefly in the paradig- mnatic combinations. In the preceding statement it has been assumed that there can be rec- ognized, in these combinations of inflection, a theme or root, as it is sometimes called, and a formative element. The formative element is used with a great many different words to define or qualify them; that is, to indicate mode, tense, number, person, gender, etc., of verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech. When in a language juxtaposition is the chief method of combination, POWELL.] COMBINATION—VOCALIC MUTATION. 5 there may also be distinguished two kinds of elements, in some sense corresponding to themes and formative parts. The theme is a word the meaning of which is determined by the formative word placed by it ; that is, the theme is a word having many radically different meanings ; with which meaning it is to be understood is determined only by the formative word, which thus serves as its label. The ways in which the theme words are thus labeled by the formative word are very curious, but the subject cannot be entered into here. When words are combined by compounding, the formative elements cannot so readily be distinguished from the theme; nor for the purposes under immediate consideration can compounding be well separated from agglutination. When words are combined by agglutination, theme and formative part usually appear. The formative parts are affixes; and affixes may be divided into three classes, prefixes, suffixes, and infixes. These affixes are often called incorporated particles. In those Indian languages where combination is chiefly by agglutina- tion, that is, by the use of affixes, 7. ¢., incorporated particles, certain parts of the conjugation of the verb, especially those which denote gender, number, and person, are effected by the use of article pronouns ; but in those languages where article pronouns are not found the verbs are inflected to accomplish the same part of their conjugation. Per- haps, when we come more fully to study the formative elements in these more highly inflected languages, we may discover in such elements greatly modified, 7. e., worn out, incorporated pronouns. Ii.—THE PROCESS BY VOCALIC MUTATION. Here, in order to form a new word, one or more of the vowels of the old word are changed, as in man—men, where an e is substituted for a ; ran—run, where u is substituted for a; lead—led, where e, with its proper sound, is substituted for ea with its proper sound. This method is used to a very limited extent in English. When the history of the words in which it occurs is studied it is discovered to be but an instance of the wearing out of the different elements of combined words; but in the He- brew this method prevails to a very large extent, and scholars have not yet been able to discover its origin in combination as they have in Eng- lish. It may or may not have been an original grammatic process, but because of its importance in certain languages it has been found neces- sary to deal with it as a distinct and original process. 6 ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. II1.—THE PROCESS BY INTONATION. In English, new words are not formed by this method, yet words are intoned for certain purposes, chiefly rhetorical. We use the rising in- tonation (or inflection, as it is usually called) to indicate that a question is asked, and various effects are given to speech by the various intona- tions of rhetoric. But this process is used in other languages to form new words with which to express new ideas. In Chinese eight distinet intonations are found, by the use of which one word may be made to express eight different ideas, or perhaps it is better to say that eight words may be made of one. IV.—THE PROCESS BY PLACEMENT. The place or position of a word may affect its significant use. Thus in English we say John struck James. By the position of those words to each other we know that John is the actor, and that James receives the action. By the grammatic processes language is organized. Organization postulates the differentiation of organs and their combination into in- tegers. The integers of language are sentences, and their organs are the parts of speech. Linguistic organization, then, consists in the dif- ferentiation of the parts of speech and the integration of the sentence. For example, let us take the words John, father, and love. John is the name of an individual; love is the name of a mental action, and father the name of a person. We put them together, John loves father, and they express a thought; John becomes a noun, and is the subject of the sentence ; love becomes a verb, and is the predicant ; father a noun, and is the object; and we now have an organized sentence. A sentence re- quires parts of speech, and parts of speech are such because they are used as the organic elements of a sentence. The criteria of rank in languages are, first, grade of organization, 7. eé., the degree to which the grammatic processes and methods are special- ized, and the parts of speech differentiated; second, sematologic con- tent, that is, the body of thought which the language is competent to convey. The grammatic processes may be used for three purposes: First, for derivation, where a new word to express a new idea is made by combining two or more old words, or by changing the vowel of one word, or by changing the intonation of one word. i POWELL. } INTONATION—PLACEMENT. 7 Second, for modification, a word may be qualified or defined by the processes of combination, vocalic mutation or intonation. It should here be noted that the plane between derivation and quali- fication is not absolute. Third, for relation. When words as signs of ideas are used together to express thought, the relation of the words must be expressed by some means. In English the relation of words is expressed both by place- ment and combination, i. ¢., inflection for agreement. It should here be noted that paradigmatic inflections are used for two distinct purposes, qualification and relation. A word is qualified by in- flection when the idea expressed by the inflection pertains to the idea expressed by the word inflected ; thus a noun is qualified by inflection when its number and gender are expressed. A word is related by in- flection when the office of the word in the sentence is pointed out thereby; thus, nouns are related by case inflections ; verbs are related by inflections for gender, number, and person. All inflection for agree- ment is inflection for relation. In English, three of the grammatic processes are highly specialized. Combination is used chiefly for derivation, but to some slight extent for qualification and relation in the paradigmatic categories. But its use in this manner as compared with many other languages has almost disappeared. Vocalic mutation isused to a very limited extent and only by accident, and can scarcely be said to belong to the English language. Intonation is used as a grammatie process only to a limited extent— simply to assist in forming the interrogative and imperative modes. Its use here is almost rhetorical; in all other cases it is purely rhetorical. Placement is largely used in the language, and is highly specialized, performing the office of exhibiting the relations of words to each other in the sentence; 7. é., it is used chiefly for syntactic relation. Thus one of the four processes does not belong to the English lan- guage; the others are highly specialized. The purposes for which the processes are used are derivation, modifi- cation, and syntactic relation. Derivation is accomplished by combination. Modification is accomplished by the differentiation of adjectives and adverbs, as words, phrases, and clauses. Syntactic relation is accomplished by placement. Syntactic relation must not be confounded with the relation expressed by prepositions. Syntactic relation is the relation of the parts of speech to each other as integral parts of a sentence. Prepositions express relations of thought of another order. They relate words to each other as words. Placement relates words to each other as parts of speech. In the Indian tongues combination is used for all three purposes, per- forming the three different functions of derivation, modification, and re- 8 ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. lation. Placement, also, is used for relation, and for both kinds of rela- tion, syntactic and prepositional. With regard, then, to the processes and purposes for which they are used, we find in the Indian languages a low degree of specialization ; processes are used for diverse purposes, and purposes are accomplished by diverse processes. DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH. It is next in order to consider to what degree the parts of speech are differentiated in Indian languages, as compared with English. ' Indian nouns are extremely connotive, that is, the name does more than simply denote the thing to which it belongs; in denoting the ob- ject it also assigns to it some quality or characteristic. Every object has many qualities and characteristics, and by describing but a part of these the true office of the noun is but imperfectly performed. A strictly denotive name expresses no one quality or character, but embraces all qualities and characters. In Ute the name for bear is he seizes, or the hugger. In this case the verb is used for the noun, and in so doing the Indian names the bear by predicating one of his characteristics. Thus noun and verb are un- differentiated. -in Seneca the north is the sun never goes there, and this sentence may be used as adjective or noun; in such cases noun, adject- ive, verb, and adverb are found as one vocable or word, and the four parts of speech are undifferentiated. In the Pavédnt language a school- house is called pé-kint-in-in-yi-kiin. The first part of the word, pé-kint, signifies sorcery is practiced, and is the name given by the Indians to any writing, from the fact that when they first learned of writing they supposed it to be a method of practicing sorcery; in-in-yi is the verb signifving to count, and the meaning of the word has been extended so as to signify to read; kin signifies wigwam, and is derived from the verb kédri, to stay. Thus the name of the school-house literally signifies a staying place where sorcery is counted, or where papers are read. The Pavint in naming a school-house describes the purpose for which it is used. These examples illustrate the general characteristics of Indian nouns; they are excessively connotive; a simply denotive name is rarely found. In general their name-words predicate some attribute of the ob- ject named, and thus noun, adjective, and predicant are undifferentiated. In many Indian languages there is no separate word for eye, hand, arm, or other parts and organs of the body, but the word is found with an incorporated or attached pronoun signifying my hand, myeye; your hand, your eye; his hand, his eye, ete., as the case may be. If the Indian, in naming these parts, refers to his own body, he says my; if he refers to POWELL. } ARTICLE PRONOUNS—GENDERS. 9 the body of the person to whom he is speaking, he says your, &c. If an Indian should find a detached foot thrown from the amputating-table of an army field hospital, he would say something like this: I have found somebody his foot. The linguistic characteristic is widely spread, though not universal. Thus the Indian has no command of a fully differentiated noun ex- pressive of eye, hand, arm, or other parts and organs of the body. In the pronouns we often have the most difficult part of an Indian language. Pronouns are only to a limited extent independent words. Among the free pronouns the student must early learn to distinguish be- tween the personal and the demonstrative. The demonstrative pronouns are more commonly used. The Indian is more accustomed to say this person or thing, that person or thing, than he, she, or it. Among the free personal pronouns the student may find an equivalent of the pro- noun J, another signifying I and you; perhaps another signifying I and he, and one signifying we, more than two, including the speaker and those present; and another including the speaker and persons absent. He will also find personal pronouns in the second and third person, per- haps with singular, dual, and plural forms. To a large extent the pronouns are incorporated in the verbs as pre- fixes, infixes, or suffixes. In such cases we will call them article pro- nouns. These article pronouns point out with great particularity the person, number, and gender, both of subject and object, and sometimes of the indirect object. When the article pronouns are used the personal pronouns may or may not be used; but it is believed that the personal pronouns will always be found. Article pronouns may not always be found. In those languages which are characterized by them they are used alike when the subject and object nouns are expressed and when they are not. The student may at first find some difficulty with these article pronouns. Singular, dual, and plural forms will be found. Some- times distinct incorporated particles will be used for subject and object, but often this will not be the case. If the subject only is expressed, one particle may be used; if the object only is expressed, another particle; but if subject and object are expressed an entirely different particle may stand for both. But itis in the genders of these article pronouns that the greatest difficulty may be found. The student must entirely free his mind of the idea that gender is simply a distinction of sex. In Indian tongues, genders are usually methods of classification primarily into animate and inanimate. The animate may be again divided into male and female, but this is rarely the case. Often by these genders all objects are classi- fied by characteristics found in their attitudes or supposed constitution. Thus we may have the animate and inanimate, one or both, divided into the standing, the sitting, and the lying ; or they may be divided into the watery, the mushy, the earthy, the stony, the woody, and the fleshy. The gender of these article pronouns has rarely been worked: out in any “110 ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE language. The extent to which these classifications enter into the arti- cle-pronouns is not well known. The subject requires more thorough study. These incorporated particles are here called article pronouns. In the conjugation of the verb they take an important part, and have by some writers been called transitions. Besides pointing out with par- ticularity the person, number, and gender or the subject and object, they perform the same offices that are usually performed by those in- flections of the verb that occur to make them agree in gender, number, and person with the subject. In those Indian languages where the arti- cle pronouns are not found, and the personal pronouns only are used, the verb is usually inflected to agree with the subject or object, or both, in the same particulars. The article pronouns as they point out person, number, gender, and case of the subject and object, are not simple particles, but are to a greater or lesser extent compound; their component elements may be broken apart and placed in different parts of the verb. Again, the arti- cle pronoun in some languages may have its elements combined into a distinct word in such a manner that it will not be incorporated in the verb, but will be placed immediately before it. For this reason the term article pronoun has been chosen rather than attached pronoun. The older term, transition, was given to them because of their analogy in function to verbal inflections. Thus the verb of an Indian language contains within itself incorpor- ated article pronouns which point out with great particularity the gen- der, number, and person of the subject and object. In this manner verb, pronoun, and adjective are combined, and to this extent these parts of speech are undifferentiated. In some languages the article pronoun constitutes a distinct word, but whether free or incorporated it is a complex tissue of adjectives. Again, nouns sometimes contain particles within themselves to predi- cate possession, and to this extent nouns and verbs are undifferentiated. The verb is relatively of much greater importance in an Indian tongue than in a civilized language. To a large extent the pronoun is incor- porated in the verb as explained above, and thus constitutes a part of its conjugation. Again, adjectives are used as intransitive verbs, as in most Indian languages there is no verb to be used as a predicant or copula. Where in English we would say the man is good the Indian would say that man good, using the adjective as an intransitive verb, @. €., as a predi- cant. If he desired to affirm it in the past tense, the intransitive verb good would be inflected, or otherwise modified, to indicate the tense; and so, in like manner, all adjectives when used to predicate can be modi- fied to indicate mode, tense, number, person, &c., as other intransitive verbs. Adverbs are used as intransitive verbs. In English we may say he is there; the Indian would say that person there usually preferring POWELL. ] WORDS USED AS INSTRANSITIVE VERBS. i4l the demonstrative to the personal pronoun. The adverb there would, therefore, be used as a predicant or intransitive verb, and might be con- jugated to denote different modes, tenses, numbers, persons, ete. Verbs will often receive adverbial qualifications by the use of incorporated particles, and, still further, verbs may contain within themselves ad- verbial limitations without our being able to trace such meanings to any definite particles or parts of the verb. Prepositions are intransitive verbs. In English we may say the hat is on the table; the Indian would say that hat on table; or he might change the order, and say that hat table on; but the preposition on would be used as an intransitive verb to predicate, and may be conju- gated. Prepositions may often be found as particles incorporated in verbs, and, still further, verbs may contain within themselves preposi- tional meanings without our being able to trace such meanings to any definite particles within the verb. But the verb connotes such ideas that something is needed to complete its meaning, that something being a limiting or qualifying word, phrase, or clause. Prepositions may be prefixed, infixed, or suffixed to nouns, ¢. e., they may be particles incor- porated in nouns. Nouns may be used as intransitive verbs under the circumstances when in English we would use a noun as the complement of a sentence after the verb to be. The verb, therefore, often includes within itself subject, direct object, indirect object, qualifier, and relation-idea. Thus it is that the study of an Indian language is, to a large extent, the study of its verbs. Thus adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and nouns are used as in- transitive verbs; and, to such extent, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, nouns, and verbs are undifferentiated. From the remarks above, it will be seen that Indian verbs often in- clude within themselves meanings which in English are expressed by adverbs and adverbial phrases and clauses. Thus the verb may express within itself direction, manner, instrument, and purpose, one or all, as the verb to go may be represented by a word signifying go home; an- . other, go away from home; another, go to a place other than home; an- other, go from a place other than home; one, go from this place, with reference to home; one, to go up; another, to go down; one, go around ; and, perhaps, there will be a verb go up hill; another, go up a valley ; another, go up a river, ete. Then we may have to go on foot, to go on horseback, to go in @ canoe; still another, to go for water ; another for wood, ete. Distinct words may be used for all these, or a fewer number used, and these varied by incorporated particles. In like manner, the English verb to break may be represented by several words, each of which will indicate the manner of performing the act or the instrument with which it is done. Distinct words may be used, or a common word varied with incorporated particles. The verb to strike may be represented by several words, signifying We ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. severally to strike with the fist, to strike with a club, to strike with the open hand, to strike with a whip, to strike with a switch, to strike with a flat in- strument, etc. A common word may be used with incorporated parti- cles or entirely different words used. Mode in an Indian tongue is a rather difficult subject. Modes analo- gous to those of civilized tougues are found, and many conditions and qualifications appear in the verb which in English and other civilized languages appear as adverbs, and adverbial phrases and clauses. No plane of separation can be drawn between such adverbial qualifications and true modes. Thus there may be a form of the verb, which shows that the speaker makes a declaration as certain, 7. e., an indicative mode; another which shows that the speaker makes a declaration with doubt, 7. e., a dubitative mode; another that he makes a declaration on hearsay, 7. ¢., a quotative mode; another form will be used in making a command, giving an imperative mode; another in imploration, 7. ¢., an implorative mode; another form to denote permission, 7. ¢., a permissive mode; another in negation, 7. e., a negative mode; another form will be used to indicate that the action is simultaneous with some other action, i. €., a simulative mode; another to denote desire or wish that something be done, i. ¢., a desiderative mode; another that the action ought to be done, i. e., an obligative mode; another that action is repetitive from time to time, 7. e., a frequentative mode; another that action is caused, i. €., @ causative mode, ete. These forms of the verb, which we are compelled to call modes, are of great number. Usually with each of them a particular modal particle or incorporated adverb will be used; but the particular particle which gives the qualified meaning may not always be discovered; and in one language a different word will be introduced, wherein another the same word will be used with an incorporated particle. It is stated above that incorporated particles may be used to indicate direction, manner, instrument, and purpose; in fact, any adverbial quali- fication whatever may be made by an incorporated particle instead of an adverb as a distinct word. No line of demarkation can be drawn between these adverbial parti- cles and those mentioned above as modal particles. Indeed it seems best to treat all these forms of the verb arising from incorporated par- ticles as distinct modes. In this sense, then, an Indian language has a multiplicity of modes. It should be further remarked that in many cases these modal or adverbial particles are excessively worn, so that they may appear as additions or changes of simple vowel or consonant sounds. When incorporated particles are thus used, distinct adverbial words, phrases, or clauses may also be employed, and the idea expressed twice. In an Indian language itis usually found difficult to elaborate a system of tenses in paradigmatic form. Many tenses or time particles are found incorporated in verbs. Some of these time particles are excessively POWELL.] VOICE—MODE—TENSE. 13 worn, and may appear rather as inflections than as incorporated par- ticles. Usually rather distinct present, past, and future tenses are dis- covered ; often a remote or ancient past, and less often an immediate future. But great specification of time in relation to the present and in relation to other time is usually found. It was seen above that adverbial particles cannot be separated from modal particles. In like manner tense particles cannot be separated from adverbial and modal particles. In an Indian language adverbs are differentiated only to a limited ex- tent. Adverbial qualifications are found in the verb, and thus there are a multiplicity of modes and tenses, and no plane of demarkation can be drawn between mode and tense. From preceding statements it will ap- pear that a verb in an Indian tongue may have incorporated with it a great variety of particles, which can be arranged in three general classes, i. é., pronominal, adverbial, and prepositional. The pronominal particles we have called article pronouns; they serve to point out a variety of characteristics in the subject, object, and indi- rect object of the verb. They thus subserve purposes which in English are subserved by differentiated adjectives as distinct parts of speech. They might, therefore, with some propriety, have been called adjective particles, but these elements perform another function; they serve the pur- pose which is usually called agreement in language; that is, they make the verb agree with the subject and object, and thus indicate the syntac- tic relation between subject, object, and verb. In this sense they might with propriety have been called relation particles, and doubtless this function was inmind when some of the older grammarians called them transitions. The adverbial particles perform the functions of voice, mode, and tense, together with many other functions that are performed in lan- guages spoken by more highly civilized people by differentiated adverbs, adverbial phrases, and clauses. The prepositional particles perform the function of indicating a great variety of subordinate relations, like the prepositions used as distinct parts of speech in English. By the demonstrative function of some of the pronominal particles, they are closely related to adverbial particles, and adverbial particles are closely related to prepositional particles, so that, it will be sometimes difficult to say of a particular particle whether it be pronominal or ad- verbial, and of another particular particle whether it be adverbial or prepositional. Thus the three classes of particles are not separated by absolute planes of demarkation. The use of these particles as parts of the verb; the use of nouns, ad- jectives, adverbs, and prepositions as intransitive verbs; and the direct use of verbs as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, make the study of an Indian tongue to a large extent the study of its verbs. 14 ON THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE. To the extent that voice, mode, and tense are accomplished by the use of agglutinated particles or inflections, to that extent adverbs and verbs are undifferentiated. To the extent that adverbs are found as incorporated particles in verbs, the two parts of speech are undifferentiated. To the extent that prepositions are particles incorporated in the verb, prepositions and verbs are undifferentiated. To the extent that prepositions are affixed to nouns, prepositions and nouns are undifferentiated. Tn all these particulars it is seen that the Indian tongues belong to a very low type of organization. Various scholars have called attention to this feature by describing Indian languages as being holophrastic, polysynthetic, or synthetic. The term synthetic is perhaps the best, and may be used as synonymous with undifferentiated. Indian tongues, therefore, may be said to be highly synthetic in that their parts of speech are imperfectly differentiated. In these same particulars the English language is highly organized, as the parts of speech are highly differentiated. Yet the difference is one of degree, not of kind. To the extent in the English iSndaues that inflection is used for quali- fication, as for person, number, and gender of the noun and pronoun, and for mode and tense in the verb, to that extent the parts of speech are undifferentiated. But we have seen that inflection is used for this purpose to a very slight extent. There is yet in the English language one important differentiation which has been but partially accomplished. Verbs as usually consid- ered are undifferentiated parts of speech; they are nouns and adjectives, one or both, and predicants. The predicant simple is a distinct part of speech. The English language has but one, the verb to be, and this is not always a pure predicant, for it sometimes contains within itself an adverbial element when it is conjugated for mode and tense, and a con- nective element when it is conjugated for agreement. With adjectives and nouns this verb is used as a predicant. In the passive voice also it is thus used, and the participles are nouns or adjectives. In what is sometimes called the progressive form of the active voice nouns and adjectives are differentiated in the participles, and the verb “to be” is used as a predicant. But in what is usually denominated the active voice of the verb, the English language has undifferentiated parts of speech. An examination of the history of the verb to be in the English language exhibits the fact that it is coming more and more to be used as the predicant; and what is usually called the common form of the active voice is coming more and more to be limited in its use to special sig- nifications.
