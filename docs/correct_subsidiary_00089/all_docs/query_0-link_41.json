The areas where women, on average, give birth to many children in their lifetime contributes signiﬁcantly to Kenya’s rapid population growth\n\n2.8 3.4\n\n300\n\n4.4 4.7 4.8 5.4 5.6 5.9 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFILE | NATION\n\n250 Births per 1,000\n\nPopulation Day\n\n1897- 2.5m 1948- 5.4m 1962- 8.6m 1969- 10.9m 1979- 15.3m 1989- 21.4m 1999- 28.7m 2009- 38.6m\n\nAge-speciﬁc Fertility Rates by Residence (Urban and rural), Kenya 2008-09\n\nTotal fertility rates by Province\n\nPopulation in Kenya- Census\n\nProvince\n\narried women in Kenya’s arid and semi-arid north are the most active in child bearing, beating all other regions, including some that are much better endowed with economic and natural resources. During their child bearing age of between 15 and 49 years, the women give birth to twice the number of children as their counterparts in Nairobi, according to current government statistics. On average, a North Eastern Province woman would have six children during her reproductive period, compared to three for the one who lives in Nairobi.\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n200 150 100 50\n\n6\n\n0 15-19\n\n20-24\n\nFertility rate Source: NCPD\n\nrate, currently increasing by 2.9 per cent per year. This translates to an addition of one million people every year into the country’s population, which stood at 38.6 million people in 2009 when the last census was conducted. Nationally, women are preferring to have an average of 4.6 children in their reproductive period. The high fertility rates in northern Kenya appear to largely due to the fact that the region’s women seldom use contraceptives including condoms, pills of injections. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), only four in every 100 women are using contraceptives in the region. It means a large number of women are engaging in sex without the means\n\nof preventing pregnancy for those who do not wish to conceive. The low levels of contraceptive prevalence in the north is a stark contrast to that of Central Province, where the prevalence rate among married women is 67 per cent. This largely explains the low fertility rates in Central Province. However, there are other reasons that inﬂuence fertility and contraceptive prevalence rates including region of residence, religion and education.\n\nSh5,000 Amount of money Nithi MP oﬀered women who give birth\n\n25-29\n\n30-34 35-39 Age Group\n\n40-44\n\n45-49\n\nUrban Rural\n\n“Contraceptive use increases dramatically with increasing level of education,” says the KDHS report.

Last November, Nithi constituency MP Kareke Mbiuki started a campaign to oﬀer his female constituents incentive to get pregnant and give birth. He promised every woman who gives birth over the next one year Sh5,000. They would also receive a pack of diapers in a move aimed at boosting the population of the area. Mr Mbiuki said population in the area was dwindling, and urgent measures were necessary to encourage fertility.\n\nA section of the crowd during the 49th Madaraka Day Celebration at the Nyayo National Stadium on June 1.

Mr Miguna Miguna, the PM’s former advisor for coalition aﬀairs, claims in his new book that Mr Odinga has steadily built up his personal wealth over the past ﬁve years, cutting deals with regional leaders and some businessmen with questionable backgrounds in ﬁelds ranging from mining concessions in the DRC to oil deals in Uganda. Mr Miguna also asserts in his explosive new memoirs, Peeling Back the Mask: A Quest for Justice in Kenya, that some of Mr Odinga’s closest aides have become enormously wealthy since the PM took oﬃce. “I walked into Raila’s oﬃce with Caroli Omondi just before 8am one Wednesday morning in April 2011. There was something important I wanted the three of us to discuss. The previous day, I had visited Hon. (Dr)\n\nTO COMMENT ON THESE AND OTHER STORIES GO TO www.nation.co.ke/ 11072012\n\nSally Kosgei in her Ministry of Agriculture oﬃce at Kilimo House. What she had disclosed had shocked me. Dr Kosgei had informed me that she had heard that Caroli had purchased Heron (Court) Hotel, a three-star facility in Nairobi. Her information was that Caroli had purchased the hotel for between Sh800 million to Sh1 billion. Many might ask why I found that shocking. Well, Caroli happened to be Raila’s private secretary. Oﬃcially, Caroli was the Principal Administration Secretary for the Oﬃce of the Prime Minister. His take home pay was less than Sh300,000. By April 2009, Caroli had worked for the OPM for exactly two years. Even if he was saving 90 per cent of his net income — an impossible feat in any society — he would still not have saved Sh800m within two years.” Neither Dr Sally Kosgei nor Mr Omondi could be reached for comment yesterday and none responded to text messages sent to their mobile phones. Mr Omondi is reputed to have been an independently wealthy property owner even before 2007 and housed the Raila Odinga Campaign Headquarters in one of his Upper Hill premises. Mr Odinga, according to Mr Miguna, took a relaxed attitude to queries about the alleged ﬁnancial impropriety by oﬃcials within his oﬃce. Writes Miguna: “Jakom, hear what Miguna is saying…that people are saying that I bought Heron Court,” Caroli started as soon as we sat down around a small coﬀee table. He was laughing. He didn’t wait for me to introduce the subject. I also noticed the casual and joking manner Caroli was approaching the issue, which I found unnerving. “‘Hmmm…hmmm…hmmm, is that so?” (Mr Odinga said) “Miguna,\n\nFILE | NATION\n\nMr Miguna Miguna (in cap) with Prof Mutakha Kangu during a meeting hosted by the Committee of Experts on the Constitutional Review at Leisure Lodge hotel in Diani, South Coast in September 2009. what’s wrong if Caroli bought Heron Court, hmm? What’s wrong with that? What’s wrong with Luos? Why are they talking too much, hmm? Who told them not to make money?’ Raila dismissed me even before I could open my mouth.” The deals Mr Miguna describes run the gamut from oil money to mineral concessions in southern Africa to others involving a subsidised maize scheme which was subsequently found to have been abused by oﬃcials, costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of shillings. Mr Miguna links Mr Odinga to controversial South African tycoon Antònio Texeira, the chairman of Petroplus Africa, who is associated with the Branch Energy and Executive\n\nOutcomes private security-cum-paramilitary ﬁrms that have been criticised for their work in war zones such as the diamond ﬁelds of Sierra Leone. Mr Texeira has interests in gold, oil and diamonds in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. He says Mr Texeira was introduced to Mr Odinga by his former PA, Herbert Ojwang’. Those contacts, which Mr Odinga acquired while he was minister for Energy, subsequently helped Mr Texeira buy the controlling stake in one of the Odingas ﬂagship ﬁrms, Spectre International. “Then of course, are Raila’s (and through him, Caroli’s) “connections” to Rupiah Banda, President of Zambia from 2008 to 2011. Caroli frequently boasted to me of their\n\ngrandiose investments in the copper ﬁelds of Zambia. So thick were the connections that Raila sent Orengo and someone else to Zambia on the day Zambians voted in the September 2011 presidential elections.” Mr Miguna was a senior aide in Mr Odinga’s oﬃce until he was suspended by the PM in August. His new memoirs oﬀer insights into the behind-the-scenes intrigues at the highest levels of the coalition government. But some have questioned Mr Miguna’s motives for writing the book. Mr Odinga’s spokesman, Dennis Onyango, said the PM will issue a comprehensive rejoinder to the book CONTINUED ON PAGE 5\n\nNational News 5\n\nDAILY NATION Wednesday July 11, 2012\n\nDoctor to be tried in wife’s murder case\n\nDISPUTE | Group fears innocent Kenyans might be arrested\n\nDeﬁne terrorism, says lobby in row over Bill\n\nBY NATION CORRESPONDENT A medical doctor has been charged with killing his wife and then cutting her body into pieces.

Some of the issues examined by Mr Miguna are the question of the methods used by politicians to raise funds for their campaigns and some of the deals they strike once they get into oﬃce. Mr Miguna tells of an alleged deal between Mr Odinga and Uganda’s president Yoweri Museveni, two men who have uneasy ties but, if Mr Miguna is to be believed, have shared business interests. “On another occasion, Caroli talked to me – and I also heard him speaking on the telephone – about an oil deal involving Raila, Museveni and some “powerful men around Museveni”. Some of my Kenyan readers might recall that Raila made a sudden trip to Uganda and met Museveni at State House, Entebbe, around mid-2009. The agenda of the visit wasn’t publicly disclosed. During that visit Raila and Museveni purportedly agreed to work together in order to process and sell the oil currently being produced from Lake Albert in Uganda. Initially, Museveni was keen to construct a brand new reﬁnery in Uganda to handle the production but Caroli informed me that Raila had managed to convince Museveni that it would be ‘cheaper and more proﬁtable to do it in Mombasa’. Now obviously many people would say that Raila was only doing this for the economic good of\n\nKenya. That’s possible. Why, for example, was the Ministry of Energy not involved in the discussions? Why was Caroli – Raila’s Private Secretary – deeply involved in the discussions?” Mr Miguna also claims that another international businessman, Lee Jang-Soon of South Korea, “invested heavily” in Mr Odinga in the 2002 and 2007 elections. Mr Miguna claims that it is Mr Texeira who gave Mr Odinga the distinctive black helicopter, together with its pilot and mechanical crew in the 2002 election campaigns.\n\nConﬂict of interest\n\nHe claimed that Mr Odinga’s business ties with Mr Texeira presented a serious conﬂict of interest because after the 2002 election, he became Energy minister and was friends with a businessman who wanted to invest in the sector. Mr Texeira’s A1 Grand Prix series company, he claims, collapsed as a result of his heavy investment in Mr Odinga. The A1 Grand Prix Series was founded by Sheikh Maktoum Hasher Maktoum of Dubai to rival the Formula 1 Series. But it collapsed after only a few seasons after the billionaire sheikh sold out to a group led by Mr Texeira. The South Korean contributed money to Mr Odinga’s campaign in 2007, Mr Miguna claims, but the funds did not reach the campaign and were pocketed by an aide.\n\nMr Miguna writes that Mr Odinga was introduced to Mr Texeira by another businessman, Tanzanian Ali Ahmed Said of Tanganyika Investment and Oil transport company. It was Mr Said, he says, who organised the shipment of maize from South Africa to Kenya some of which was subsequently found to be bad. The Kenya Bureau of Standards, which inspected the maize, declared it unfit for human consumption and wanted it returned to South Africa but the importers resisted this decision. Mr Miguna also claims that Mr Omondi and OPM permanent secretary, Dr Mohammed Isahakia, who were suspended to pave way for investigations into the maize scandal, were never really on suspension. The two were cleared and reinstated. Dr Isahakia was unavailable for comment. But while on suspension, claims Miguna, they were allowed unlimited access to their oﬃces almost every day and were paid full salaries. Then Agriculture minister William Ruto, who was accused of issuing the allotment letters to his friends and political associates, survived a censure motion in Parliament over the scandal. Mr Ruto, who has since left ODM after falling out with Mr Odinga, maintained then that the genesis of the scandal was in the PM’s oﬃce.\n\nSERIALISATION IN DN2\n\nMuslim rights lobby yesterday asked the government to give a clear definition of terrorism before a Bill on the crime, which is on the rise in the country, can be tabled in Parliament. The Muslims for Human Rights (Muhuri) led MPs and activists yesterday in criticising the Terrorism Bill 2012, arguing that it does not bring out the precise deﬁnition of terrorism and related acts. They expressed fears that if enacted in its current form, the Bill will lead to rampant arrests of innocent Kenyans on the pretext that they were involved in terrorism. Mr Mbugua Mureithi, a counter-terrorism and human rights lawyer, said\n\nthe Bill should be scrapped for failing to isolate terror acts from other crimes. “Terrorism is relative. There is no universal deﬁnition of terrorism. The Bill should be susceptible to expansion since currently it lacks a clear deﬁnition,” Mr Mureithi said. He spoke during a forum organised by Muhuri, dubbed “Prevention of Terrorism Bill CRITICISM\n\nMPs join lobby in faulting law Nominated MPs Shakira Abdalla and Sheikh Dor aﬃrmed their support for Muhuri’s bid to block the terrorism Bill.

Participants discussed various provisions of the Bill, which they thought would undermine the war against terror in the country. Citing Section 2 of Part One that deﬁnes terror acts, Mr Mureithi said it was not clear in its wording and falls short on ways of preventing the crime. It defines terror acts as those that end up in death or bodily harm, and involve use of arms or explosives and releasing of radioactive substances that are harmful to human beings. Citing Section 21 of the Bill, Mr Mureithi argued that it amounted to an infringement on the freedom of expression, punishing Kenyans for exercising their rights to information. It proposes conviction and imprisonment of individuals who “publish, distribute or otherwise make information” which can lead to acts of terrorism. This, he said, was in breach of the new Constitution article 33.\n\n6 | National News\n\nDAILY NATION Wednesday July 11, 2012\n\nIN THE DOCK | Two suspected of being behind a kidnap ring\n\nStudents deny killing colleague Young woman was murdered after being abducted by gangsters who demanded Sh100,000 ransom\n\nPolice get leads from note left by victim\n\n[email protected]\n\nT\n\nwo students suspected of being behind a kidnap-forransom ring in Nairobi were yesterday charged with the murder of a colleague. Mr Duncan Livingstone Kimanthi, a fourth year student at the United States International University (Usiu), and Ms Winnie Wairimu Kariuki, of the Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology, denied killing Ms Sarah Akello Aruwa on the night of June 30/July 1 at Kiamiako in Githunguri, Kiambu County. Ms Aruwa, who was a fourth year International Relations student, had been kidnapped by gangsters who called her family for a Sh100,000 ransom. The prosecution told Mr Justice Nicholas Ombija that the oﬀence was committed jointly with others not in court. Prosecutors Catherine Mwaniki and Daniel Karuri asked the court to allow police to hold the suspects further in custody “as they may face additional charges depending on the outcome of\n\nan investigation still ongoing”. The suspects are scheduled to appear in a Makadara court today for mention of a separate case in which they are accused of abduction and robbery. They were charged in Makadara last week with abducting and secretly conﬁning a student at the Usiu, Ms Mellisa Omondi Ouko, on May 10. In the case, they also face a capital charge of robbing Ms Mellisa Omondi of a mobile phone and cash, all valued at Sh36,000. The prosecution at Makadara had asked the court to have the suspects detained for a week so they could help police trace Ms Omondi, who had reportedly been missing for two months since her abduction.\n\nOn June 30, the day she was abducted and detained for ransom, Ms Sarah Akello Aruwa left a note with the phone number of a male student who would have been her host. Five days after her body was found in Kiambu, police used the phone number to ﬁnd the suspect, with further investigations revealing the invitation was just a lure to kidnap her. Yesterday, State counsels prosecuting the murder case told the court that the suspects are required in Makadara for mention of the abduction case.

The gang of four men armed with an AK47 and a pistol raided a wholesale shop around 8pm on Monday, and robbed the owner, Mr Daniel Njuguna, of Sh70,000 after hitting him with the gun’s butt. “They grabbed my employee Kioko Mutili and threatened to shoot him dead if we did not co-operate. I co-operated and they took all the money,” Mr Njuguna said. A gangster crossed the road and ordered the owner of another shop to surrender all the money he had. Mr Simon Njuguna said that as soon as the saw the man approaching his shop, he lay down on the ﬂoor. “He went to the cash register and took all the money,” Mr Njuguna said.

A day after he died on May 19, a mobile telephone and an ATM card he had surrendered at the report desk the previous night before being locked in the cells disappeared. Two officers who were manning the report office — constables John Pamba and Ismael — were quizzed on the matter, according to an investigation report conducted by CID headquarters in Nairobi. The young man’s family claims 28-year-old Monson\n\nwas beaten to death while in police custody, allegations denied by oﬃcers at Diani Police Station where he was held. Inspector Ronald Kimanzi made the inquiry against his juniors and the ﬁndings are not revealed in the report signed by head of the Investigations Bureau at CID headquarters, Mr Mohamed Amin. Curiously the report adds: “On June 7, oﬃcers from CID while conducting investigations into the death arrested Saidi Ali Shepeu and recovered\n\nthe same mobile phone. He was later arraigned in a Mombasa court for the oﬀence of stealing and handling stolen goods. Later another suspect, Justin Hassan, was also arrested and will be arraigned in court on June 12.” The report does not explain how the two got the phones from the station after the owner died. Immediately after Mr Monson’s death, police investigations showed he may have died of complications due to drug use. But a new investigation, which based its conclusions on a pathologist’s, concurs with the family assertions that he died of an injury to the head, inﬂicted with an object. “Our investigations could not specifically establish how and where the injury was sustained,” reads part of the report. In total, police said they interviewed 26 witnesses, including one of his friends, Enrico Mandella Kiko, who police say visited him at the station around 3.30am, before he died.\n\nCAMPING | IDPs protest\n\nAnti-Obama ﬁlm features his brother BY KEVIN J KELLEY\n\nNation Correspondent in New York US President Barack Obama’s Kenyan half-brother features in a soon-to-be-released documentary that is intended to damage his reelection bid in November.

At the launch of his presidential bid on Monday, Mr Musyoka surprised friends and foes alike when he hit hard at his opponents after the Kamba Council of Elders gave him the blessings to ﬁght for the presidency. He described Prime Minister Raila Odinga as a fake reformer and questioned the source of money that Kilome MP John Haroun Mwau has been using in his constituency. The VP’s spokesman, Mr Kaplich Barsito, said while his boss has always embraced politics of consultation and consensus\n\nbuilding, a time comes when he is forced to abandon the approach in pursuit of what he feels is just for Kenya. “It is not his nature to throw stones. However, certain principals and values he holds dear at times force him to react the way he did in Machakos; it often pains him to see some people present a false pretext,” he said. On Monday, in an apparent reference to the PM, Mr Musyoka said: “If The Hague was there in 1982, then some of us who are seeking leadership should have been in jail somewhere in the Netherlands. “They tried to overthrow an elected government, and in the process caused many deaths and made our economy to suffer. These are the same people who today claim to be reformists.” Still on Mr Odinga, Mr Musyoka added: “And the other day,\n\nPARTY MEMBERSHIP\n\nThe G7 Alliance Vice-President is running for the presidency under the Wiper Democratic Movement party ticket.

Kangundo MP Johnstone Muthama and Philip Kaloki (Kibwezi) said yesterday the VP’s attacking style was what Kenyans have been expecting from him for a long time. “You don’t hit your challengers with kid gloves; this is the time to hit them hard with a knock-out punch and that is exactly what Mr Musyoka is doing now,” Mr Muthama said.\n\nFREE MEDICAL CAMP | Residents receive custom-made hearing aids Fourteen-year-old Isaac Kahura from Elburgon is ﬁtted with a hearing aid during a free medical camp at Ngala School for the Deaf in Nakuru yesterday.

Broadly, the court ruled that the 80 new constituencies created by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, which were vigorously opposed, were legitimate. Petitioners who lost out are still smarting from the outcome, but by and large, it must be accepted that the court has given direction based on evidence adduced before it. First, the speed with which it dispensed with the 137 cases was commendable. This eliminated earlier worries that the plaints would take too long to adjudicate, in turn, aﬀect the election timetable. Second, the litigation underscored a high level of democracy. Citizens can no longer accept decisions by those in authority unquestioningly. This is a poignant message to all institutions of governance that they must strictly adhere to the rule of law. The judges also ruled that Parliament ought to review the transitional clause in the Constitution regarding county boundaries, with a view to clearly deﬁning them to remove doubts. With the cases out of the way, the stage is now set for the electoral body to conﬁdently embark on preparing for the elections set for March next year. The election will be a litmus test for our democracy given the 2007 experience. The IEBC must henceforth move steadily to organise credible elections to restore the conﬁdence of Kenyans.\n\nNobody’s being targeted\n\nS\n\nome of our readers have expressed disquiet at our decision to serialise Peeling Back The Mask: A Quest for Justice in Kenya by Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s former advisor for coalition aﬀairs, Mr Miguna Miguna. Admittedly, Mr Miguna’s style and some of the revelations in his book will make some Kenyans uncomfortable. But Mr Miguna was gladiator in the conﬂicts of the coalition government. He was a member of the ruling class, an observer and participant in the exercise of power behind the scenes. It is the cardinal duty of journalism to provide the people with information which enables them to understand their leaders and how they exercise the power they are entrusted with when the curtains are drawn. Typically, the Daily Nation has exercised careful editorial judgement in selecting and editing excerpts from Mr Miguna’s book. Our task is to inform Kenyans, not to target individuals. If Mr Miguna’s book results in a healthy and honest debate on leadership in our country and how we can move forward as a healed and cohesive society, it will have achieved an important end. Democracy is not a game of averting our gaze from opinions that we do not like, or condemning them unexpressed. The publication of Mr Miguna’s memoirs should be viewed in this positive spirit.

How else do you explain the fact that they are unwilling to bring interests rates down even after the Central Bank of Kenya recently brought down the Central Bank Rate by a signiﬁcant margin? I am not in the habit of cramming this column with statistics and ﬁgures. Statistics will make you sound clever and learned. But when your aim is to provoke informed debate and inﬂuence public policy, cramming too many numbers in a column like this can be counterproductive. You end up crowding out the less numericallyinclined segments of society from participating in the conversation. I want to introduce just a few important pieces of statistics to substantiate my assertion that commercial banks in this country are greedy. The ﬁrst piece of statistic I wish to rely on is the Treasury Bill rate. Why is the movement of this rate important in this debate? Because this is the benchmark that all commercial banks use to price loans. Allow me to explain. Literally, every week,\n\nthe government is in the market borrowing money by issuing Treasury Bills. And, the biggest buyers of Treasury Bills are commercial banks. Put another way, commercial banks collect money from the public and then lend some of it to them at some proﬁt margin. Because lending to the government is riskfree, banks price the loans which they lend to businesses and members of the public oﬀ the Treasury Bill Rate. Going by this logic, lending rates should always come down in tandem with the Treasury Bill Rate. And, how has this bill behaved? The rate has fallen from a peak of 21 per cent in January 2012 to below 11 per cent in June this year. When the Treasury Bill Rate began the downward trend around March, commercial banks said\n\nLending rates should always come down in tandem with the Treasury Bill Rate, but it has not happened”\n\nthey would not reduce lending rates because the inﬂation rate was still too high. High lending rates were a reﬂection of inﬂationary expectations, they pontiﬁcated. Which brings me to the second piece of statistics I wish to rely on to maintain the argument that commercial banks in this country are greedy — the inﬂation rate. How has inﬂation behaved? It has fallen from a peak of 19.7 per cent in November 2011 to 10.5 in June this year. When the inﬂation rate started falling several months ago, commercial banks argued that they would not reduce lending rates because the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Kenya had not reduced the Central Bank Rate, also known as the signalling rate. Just the other day, the Monetary Policy Committee lowered the Central Bank Rate from 18 per cent to 16.5 per cent, signalling to commercial banks to ease lending rates. The response from the banks has been mute, to say the least. Granted, some of the banks have responded by cutting base rates.\n\nYou still don’t see strong commitment to bringing lending rates down. I know of several businessmen who have frozen new projects because of high lending rates. Our people are paying too much for loans. High lending rates are literally choking growth as evidenced by recent statistics, which show that the gross domestic product fell to 3.5 per cent in the ﬁrst quarter of 2012 compared to 4.9 per cent in the same period last year. Commercial banks will keep giving excuses and shifting positions. They argue that they took too many expensive deposits, which they have to clear from their books ﬁrst. Yet we all know that a substantial proportion of the deposit base of commercial banks in this country is composed of current accounts on which they do not pay interest. The truth of the matter is that the average cost of funds is much lower than they tell us. We were told that the introduction of credit reference bureaus would make things better. It has not happened.

Interestingly, the same goal can be achieved when you combine a bicycle with a mobile phone... a system for charging mobile phones. About three years ago, two students developed a device that allows bicycle riders to charge their mobile phones. Similarly, in the last few weeks, local and international media have been carrying a story about a young Kenyan who has developed a system for charging mobile phones when ﬁtted to shoe soles. The outstanding component of the product is an extremely thin crystal chip that can generate electricity when walking or running. The lesson from these two inventions is clear. First, a successful invention must be informed by a speciﬁc need in the marketplace that the product will address. Second, the entrepreneur must ensure his or her creative solution addresses the need in a simple and relevant way. These two inventions can enable a majority Kenyans who still do not have access to electricity to still be able to charge their phones. If marketed well, the innovations could have a market in areas not well-served by electricity. Africa is in need of more entrepreneurs who\n\nMr Anthony Mutua shows how to charge a cellphone using a charger ﬁxed in a shoe. are not afraid of taking calculated risks. Risk-taking is crucial because it yields the innovation that gives you the vital competitive edge. Moreover, through entrepreneurship, Africa will achieve the wealth creation and employment needed to climb the ladder to prosperity. To instil a culture of entrepreneurship, two important actions are required. First, create smaller Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises entities that can then be nurtured to grow. Second, encourage mentorship and ﬁnancial support to local entrepreneurs. Financial literacy for women and youth is a key plank in Equity Bank’s push to alleviate rural poverty through the provision of aﬀordable micro-ﬁnance. The literacy\n\nprogramme will lead to social and economic transformation across Kenya and East Africa. Every entrepreneur experiences dark hours and tough times; what makes a diﬀerence is one’s perseverance and will to succeed. Only an estimated 30 per cent of start-ups in Kenya survive beyond the third year, yet SMEs provide over 70 per cent employment in the formal economy. Low levels of ﬁnancial literacy have also prevented SMEs from adequately assessing and understanding diﬀerent ﬁnancing options, and from navigating complex loan application procedures. Survival and growth of SMEs is critical since they are the engine of growth and are essential for a competitive and eﬃcient market. SMEs also play a critical role in poverty reduction especially in the rural areas. New entrants to a market economy can beneﬁt from the presence of mentors, and develop the conﬁdence they need to make appropriate and eﬀective entrepreneurial decisions. Through mentorship and ﬁnancial support, local entrepreneurs can build internationally competitive businesses. Capacity building of SMEs in terms of preparing ﬁnancial statements and business plans, as well as improving\n\ntheir ﬁnancial literacy and management training, does have a positive impact on SME development. Because of their small size, SMEs usually lack management capacity and cannot aﬀord costly support services such as training. For a long time, mentoring has been largely in the context of the large corporations, and within the framework of career development, training, and performance. Mentorship oﬀers local ﬁrms the opportunities to overcome challenges that come with generation transition. Mentors typically support entrepreneurs as they start and grow their businesses by giving expert help and assistance in problem solving, inﬂuencing behavioural and attitudinal change. Running a business is not possible without adequate funding and understanding of basic ﬁnancial management. In conclusion, we are living in an age of networks and not hierarchies where knowledge and wisdom must be distributed, rather than contained among a select few business pioneers. Dr Mwangi is CEO, Equity Group, and chairman, Vision 2030. He recently received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of the Year award, becoming the ﬁrst business leader from Africa to achieve the feat.\n\nFAMILY PLANNING | Melinda Gates\n\nEnabling women to determine their future O ne reason I am so optimistic about global development is that I see proof of what is possible everywhere I go. Developing countries are doing innovative work that is changing the lives of their people. I recently travelled to Malawi to learn about its system of frontline health workers that provides universal access to high-quality maternal and child care. When I talked to a group of women in a village on the outskirts of Dowa, they were excited about the services they now receive, but they all had the same question for me. “We used to have contraceptive injections,” they said, “but now we can’t get them. What can you do to help us?” Almost everywhere I go, I hear a version of this question. Life is getting better by many measures. Child mortality is coming down fast. To take full advantage of these improvements, women tell me they need access to contraceptives. As far as they are concerned, being able to decide when to have children is a key part of being a good parent — because it makes it possible to provide their children with food, healthcare, and education. This makes sense to me, because it is the same basic reason I used contraceptives to plan my family. However, tens of millions of women in Africa don’t have access to contraceptives. This is about to change because\n\nAfrican governments and civil society organisations are working together to lead a new movement in family planning — one led by Africans for Africans. The new movement is being kicked oﬀ with the London Summit on Family Planning, where thousands of partners will come together around a shared goal: to provide an additional 120 million women in poor countries with contraceptives, information, and services by 2020. The event is co-hosted by our foundation and the UK Government’s Department for International Development, with additional leadership from other donor governments and charitable foundations.\n\nHealthy children\n\nMost importantly, developing countries are oﬀering up ambitious new national plans that will anchor a global eﬀort. In recent years, Kenya has made signiﬁcant progress in increasing access to family planning programmes and services. In 2010, it enacted a new Constitution that declares reproductive healthcare the right of all citizens. Kenya’s Department of Reproductive Health is now working with partners to integrate family planning services into other healthcare services, like vaccine delivery for infants and children. Family planning is not new, but having\n\nAfrican countries driving it is new — and it will change the lives of women and girls and the trajectory of development in countries throughout the continent. Women want the power to determine their future. They want to maintain their own health and bear healthy children, which means spacing their births a safe distance apart. And they want to give their children the best chance to fulﬁl their potential, which means having the resources to invest in their upbringing. The amazing thing about family planning programmes is that, by giving women the power to determine their future, they also lead to economic and social development at the national level. When parents can plan for their children, keep them healthy, and send them to school, their children are more likely to contribute to a prosperous economy and a thriving society. When you multiply this eﬀect times millions of families, you have sweeping trends that can help change the prospects for an entire country, or an entire continent. In the past, some well-intentioned people in donor countries tried to impose family planning programmes, but they didn’t always put the power in the hands of women and girls.

The investigative story shows the extent to which impunity in Kenya has become a culture. No one is accountable for anything and those who ask questions disappear. Clearly, something in our government is not working, and however much we may try to initiate police reforms, all now sounds like a hoax. I thought it was weird when I saw Omar Al Bashir walk in broad daylight in Kenya. Clearly, our government doesn’t mind harbouring fugitives wanted by the ICC. KENNEDY ARUAH, Nairobi\n\nVarsity woman’s murder shows moral decadence The kidnapping and subsequent murder of a student from United States International University is a wake-up call for the society to appreciate the decadence in our institutions of higher learning. This is not an isolated case as such cases have been reported in other universities and colleges. Students have been linked to car-jacking, prostitution and drug abuse. If the students can stretch these “adventures” to the extent of murdering their own colleagues, then society must no longer look the other way. Murderous criminals must be treated as such, or else Kenya will have no future to speak of. KIPKIRUI KOSGEI GEOFFREY, Bomet\n\nGive crime reporters government protection Nominated MP Rachael Shebesh’s call for the top three investigative journalists to be protected is commendable and calls for an expeditious guarantee. Journalists John-Allan namu, Mohammed Ali and Dennis Onsarigo have brought into the limelight major scandals. The recent one on NTV, where Mr Namu exposed genocide architect Felicien Kabuga makes the need for protection all the more urgent. A security oﬃcer who took a photo of the genocide suspect is no more. The three are not safe. Elimination is not anything new in this country. But at least all citizens are watching.

It is true that one’s circumcision status has been used to frustrate people who may have genuine ambitions of community or national leadership. She gave examples of leaders around the world who are not circumcised, but who lead more powerful nations than Kenya. I do agree that issues such as these are completely irrelevant and retrogressive in a modern and evolving society. Suﬃce it to say that I am not a victim of that type of discrimination but I still ﬁnd it deplorable. Secondly, she touched on a radio station that advertises jobs in Gujarati, which is not understood by most Kenyans. Those who use these vernacular languages should bear in mind that they bear the responsibility should things go wrong as they sometimes do. They should remember that they live in Kenya and be inclusive in everything they do and say. ELIJAH O. OMBONGI, Hull, U.K.\n\nMusicians charged\n\nI wish to agree with columnist Rasna Warah that ethnic radio stations are the main impediments to the integration process. She blamed them for spreading fallacious propaganda, citing the issue of circumcision. It’s not ﬁction that this issue has been used to demonise some lead-\n\nPHONE USE: Cellphones have become an indispensable part of our lives. It’s hard to imagine how we used to live without them. However, the way some of us use these phones leaves a lot to be desired. Some people shout in PSVs, hospitals, libraries and even places of worship. Others disrupt presentations, conversations, meetings and eulogies. Still, others air their dirty linen in public. Besides, some circumstances demand we put our phones on silent or vibration. Good phone etiquette takes just a little eﬀort. KIARIE PETER, Laikipia West\n\nFluency legal\n\nTRIVIAL ARREST: Of late, police have been dwelling on trivial matters like arresting matatu drivers whose vehicles bear graﬃti, claiming that graﬃti causes accidents. Well that’s not true because accidents are still rife, while graﬃti has always been a Kenyan culture. Police should arrest drivers who are not disciplined on our roads as they are more likely to cause accidents. Heavy ﬁnes should be imposed and their driving licences revoked as a lesson to others. Those who decorate the matatus, earn a living out of it. JOHN KAMUNYA, Nairobi\n\nI read the article “Ethnic radio stations are fuelling a culture of intolerance in this country”. In my opinion, it was intended to be populist. She states: “Going by this requirement, neither I nor the majority of fellow Kenyans are eligible to apply for these jobs (Gujarati)”. How do you conclude that it is the intention of the employer to hire someone from their own “tribe”? The requirement for ﬂuency in a language is well within the employment law. JASSI SINGH, Nairobi\n\nSUGAR WARS: Wrangles erupting between sugar companies over cane poaching is going overboard. The recent attacks of three Butali Sugar workers by their Mumias Sugar counterparts is an embarrassment. Sometime last year, a similar incident happened between two sugar companies in Nyanza in which the Provincial Administration and politicians were drawn, and were allegedly accused of being used by one company to derail another. The Kenya Sugar Board should move in and help solve the issue.

Her column was spot-on because it is only recently that the NCIC implicated three musicians in composing songs that negatively portray PM Raila Odinga. The Rwandan genocide was also linked to use of these stations to spread hate propaganda against the minority Tutsis. As the country nears the General Election, the NCIC should be ﬁrm in its eﬀorts to curb a replica of 2007 by heavily ﬁning vernacular radio stations that propagate ethnic hatred.

The company owns 10,000 acres of nuclear estate, which remains fallow, yet there’s sugar deﬁcit. Are we interested in reforming the sugar sub-sector to be globally competitive and have self-suﬃciency or we are merely seeking extensions of Comesa safeguards to let unscrupulous traders reap? The country has an annual sugar deﬁcit of 200,000 metric tones, which could be sealed and surplus exported. For instance the 10,000 acres have the capacity of producing 40,000 metric tones. DAVID K SUM, Nyando\n\nThis is with regard to an advertisement by the Rural Electriﬁcation Authority (Nation, June 28). While I commend REA for opening up rural areas through provision of power, it needs to comply with the law while at it. They bulldoze their way through farms destroying property without compensation.

I think the school’s guidance and counselling department is asleep or doesn’t exist altogether. Secondary schools lacking this crucial department are prone to rampant and uncouth behaviour from the students. Teenagers are not easy to maintain, given the peer pressure and other teenage crisis, so I believe the problem of short and appealing skirts could have been solved.

First , because of the new Constitution, many say, focus has shifted downstream to the counties, where many big sharks are now drifting. What this means is that competition, especially in the race for governorship, is going to be much more ﬁerce, hence the potential for violence will increase. This is more so in counties that have more than one ethnic group whose candidates will be competing for power and inﬂuence. And, according to an NSIS map, at least 27 of the 47 counties fall in this category. In some of these regions, including Marsabit and Isiolo, there has already been violence as politicians ﬂex their muscles and position themselves for the elections. Ms Florence Sambiri-Jaoko, former chair of the Kenya National Commission on Human rights says most of this will be caused by the widespread misconception among some in the political class and citizenry that devolution is about creating tribal kingdoms. “Devolution was meant to take services closer to the people and therefore hasten development. People should know we are still in a nation called Kenya, which is greater,” Ms Jaoko says.\n\nReduce the threat\n\nDr Kibunjia says it may be necessary for communities in such counties to negotiate pre-election power sharing deals to reduce the threat of violence. Second, is the fear arising from organised criminal gangs. These include Mungiki, who police have cautioned are re-grouping, the secessionist Mombasa Republican Council at the Coast and Al-Shabaab. MRC has already warned that there will be no elections in Coast and is ready to carry out its threat. An attack on an IEBC mock election in Kiliﬁ in March served as\n\na warning. Additionally, there are reports that the group is conﬁscating people’s identity cards to prevent them from voting. Mungiki could be going for political power as well, and this could lead to violence and clashes with security agencies and civilians in areas it was once active. In other counties like Bungoma, the Sabaot Land Defence Force ghost is never far away. And then there is the research by Kepsa Youth Alliance recently, which revealed that thousands of youth groups were organising ahead of the elections. The study reveals a lot of positive contribution by young people in politics including running websites for parties, but there are also warning signs — there are those ready to serve as guns for hire to the highest bidder to intimidate their opponents. Political analyst Kipchumba Murkomen said groups like MRC could be a recipe for violence, adding that its leaders should be told devolution will address their grievances. Then there is the threat of Al-Shabaab, the Somali militant group. It is almost certain that by the time elections come, the African Union Mission in Somalia, which includes Kenyan troops, would have driven the militants out of all territory they control in Somalia. But as they have demonstrated since October last year, the militants’ cells in Kenya have the ability to strike almost at will.\n\n27\n\nNumber of counties, out of 47 in Kenya that NSIS says have the potential to erupt in violence\n\nThere is no guarantee, therefore, that their defeat on the battle ﬁeld will stop attacks in Kenya and their potential to disrupt the elections. This threat is not just limited to the border counties of North Eastern, where election oﬃcials and material could be targeted, but elsewhere during campaigns and voting. Third, is the perennial issue\n\nGroups like MRC could be a recipe for violence, and its leaders should be told devolution will address their grievances” Political analyst Kipchumba Murkomen\n\nFILE | NATION\n\nPeople who said they were internally displaced persons from Lang’ata Constituency in Nairobi County walk past Baruku Area in Nakuru two weeks ago on their way to Uganda on foot. The 83 families said they decided to trek to Uganda because they have no hope they will be resettled in Kenya after being displaced during the 2007/08 post-election violence. Fear persists as the country gears itself for another General Election. of impunity in Kenya. Many of the foot soldiers who executed the 2008 violence still walk free. This is one of the biggest potential threats to the election. Even though the suspected big boys are facing trial at The Hague, the fact that nearly 5,000 cases of murder, arson, rape and theft reported from the post-election violence are yet to be determined represents a big danger. A committee set up by the Director of Public Prosecutions says it has reviewed some 3,500 cases, but there is no hope that the foot soldiers who wielded the pangas and struck the matches will be brought to justice before March 4, 2013. If they can get away with the crimes they committed in 2007, what will prevent them from doing the same in 2013? Fourth, The Hague process is a double-edged sword. It can act as a deterrent, but it can also increase tension and lead to violence. As it has been demonstrated elsewhere, some people lash out when their leaders are indicted. In Uganda, Joseph Kony was talking peace until he was indicted and bolted back to the bush to\n\ncontinue with his crimes. In DRC, Bosco Ntaganda had integrated his rebels into the national army but when he was indicted, he quit and resumed ﬁghting. In the end, of course, there will be nowhere to run for these two, but in the interim, their crimes may intensify. In Kenya, the ICC accused’s supporters were behaving in a similar manner with the so-called prayer rallies.\n\nKitale bishop\n\nKitale Anglican Church of Kenya bishop Stephen Kewasis says many have bought the narrative that the ICC is biased and is intervening in local politics for the beneﬁt of certain candidates. “People are having a feeling for their people (those charged) who they think have been victimised... this could trigger violence,” he says. Finally, is the question of police. In the 2007 chaos, the police force was caught totally oﬀ guard. It was obvious that the force was overwhelmed by the scale of the violence. But this was not even the biggest problem. The reality that the police were\n\nbiased, that they just looked on as Kenyans were killed, that they participated in the violence by shooting to kill and raping women was revealed in the Waki Commission report. In the run up to the elections, there were very credible rumours that some security agents, especially among the Administration Police, had been hired as agents for a political party. It is these shortcomings that informed the proposal for radical changes in the structure and command of the police force, including merging the APs within the regular police. That the proposed reforms appear to have stalled after the formation of the National Police Service Commission hit a stalemate is cause for worry. Many Kenyans are putting a lot of faith in the IEBC to deliver a free and fair election, but it cannot do this alone, warns Ms Jaoko. “Other institutions like the police should be reformed so they act independently to end the impunity on electoral oﬀences,” she says.
