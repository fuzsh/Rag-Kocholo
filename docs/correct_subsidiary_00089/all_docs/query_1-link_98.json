        "meta_description": "John W. House, MD\nRecently, medicine lost two great pioneers. William F. House, MD, died in December 2012, and William E. Hitselberger, MD, died in February 2014.\nDr. House (“Dr. Bill,” as he was affectionately known) attended Whittier College and then the University of California during World War II, completing pre-dental requirements in two years, followed by his DDS.\nDuring his two years as a dental officer in the Navy, he decided to pursue medicine at the University of Southern California to become a maxillofacial surgeon. However, instead of a plastic surgery residency, he took the otolaryngology residency at Los AngelesCountyHospital, during which he became interested in otology through his brother, Howard House, MD.\nUpon completion of the residency in 1956, he joined his brother in practice. Much of what he learned in dentistry he applied to otology (e.g., dental drill, suction irrigation), but he soon became interested in solving the problems of the inner ear.\nDr. Bill House began working on innovative approaches to acoustic neuromas in the early 1960s. One of his early patients was a young fireman with unilateral progressive hearing loss. Dr. House diagnosed an acoustic neuroma and sent the patient to a neurosurgeon, who said it was too early to operate given the risks of such surgery at the time. The patient ultimately had surgery when his tumor became larger, but did not survive.\nThis caused Dr. House to conclude that early diagnosis and treatment were crucial to obtaining better outcomes. Howard had purchased one of the first microscopes for middle ear surgery, and Bill recognized its potential. He introduced the concept of using the operating microscope for neurosurgery, developing the middle cranial fossa and translabyrinthine approaches to safely remove the tumors in the cerebellopontine angle.\nHe also recognized the need to have a neurosurgeon as a key part of his surgical team. However, the neurosurgeon with whom he had begun working, and others in the area, opposed the idea of an otologist removing acoustic tumors. It was in this arena that the “two Bills” met and together shaped the future of neurotology.\nDr. Hitselberger (“Hits”) attended the University of Wisconsin where he played football and was Phi Beta Kappa. He completed his MD degree at HarvardMedicalSchool in 1956. After his internship at the University of Minnesota, he served two years in the U.S. Army Special Forces. Following his service, he completed a fellowship in neuropathology at the Mayo Clinic, completed his neurosurgery residency at Henry Ford in Detroit in 1963, and then arrived in Los Angeles.\nDr. House was seeking a new neurosurgery colleague when their paths crossed. Dr. Hitselberger immediately saw the wisdom in Dr. House’s ideas and embraced them. He even suggested that they “cross-train,” and he worked with Dr. House in the morgue and lab to acquire his microscope and temporal bone skills. A lifelong bond was created.\nAs the two doctors began to perform acoustic tumor removals at St. VincentHospital, the head of neurosurgery objected. This led to the infamous “showdown at St. Vincent” in which the neurosurgeon asked the Board of Directors and Sisters of the hospital to essentially forbid House and Dr. Hitselberger from doing the procedures, threatening to resign from the staff if the board did not do so.\nDr. Howard House then threatened to resign if “the Bills” were not allowed to continue their work. The hospital sided with them and the neurosurgeon resigned. Together, Dr. Bill House and Dr. Hitselberger removed more than 5,000 acoustic neuromas and meningiomas, using the microscope and the approaches that Dr. House had perfected.\nAfter Dr. Bill House’s success with cochlear implants, “the Bills” conceived the idea in 1979 of placing an electrode on the brainstem of a patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 in an attempt to provide hearing after the tumor was removed. She had bilateral 8th nerve tumors and was to undergo the removal of her second tumor.\nAfter the doctors discussed this new concept with her, she agreed to have the electrode placed. The tumor removal went well, as did the placement of the electrode. They stimulated the electrode in the intensive care unit, as they were concerned about possible side effects when stimulating the brainstem. The patient heard sound without complications. To this day, she is still using her Central Electro-auditory Prosthesis as they called it (now known as an Auditory Brainstem Implant or ABI).\nBoth directly and indirectly, Dr. House and Dr. Hitselberger trained hundreds of neurotologists from around the world. Their early work and perseverance has allowed the safe removal of acoustic tumors, reducing the mortality rate of such surgery in California from the 40 percent it was when they started to the less than 1 percent it is today. And, they pioneered the means to provide hearing to those deaf after removal of bilateral tumors. We all owe a great deal to these pioneers—a winning team.",
