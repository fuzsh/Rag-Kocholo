Meet, Malungelo (Headman) Zilimbola The Black Panther. His mission is to showcase black talent in S.A’s financial services industry. Born in South Africa. He grew up on a little cattle farm. In the North West province. Malu left home at 20 to study in Cape Town. He went to Cape Peninsula University of Technology then University of Cape Town to study Quantity Surveying. Drawn by the mix of technical & commerce skills in the degree. A few years in and he knew it wasn’t for him. Even so, he went on to work for a homebuilding company after graduation. But the markets crashed in 1998. Drying up opportunities in the sector. Leaving him no option but to go back to school. Malu went back to University of Cape Town to do a BCom in Finance. In 2000, he joined Ninety One as an investment analyst. Covering construction, engineering, property and transport sectors. He rose through the ranks to be a Portfolio Manager. Managing various real estate funds. He left Ninety One in 2003 to lead RMB - Rand Merchant Bank as director & senior PM. Managing stocks portfolio of $3.1+ billion. Malu became one of the best-performing PMs. By the time he left RMB - Rand Merchant Bank, Malu had one of the strongest investing track records in the S.A equity market. During his time at RMB, he began thinking about building something permanent. That would benefit the broader society. He also wanted to debunk the myth. That blacks don’t know how to manage money. Doubters had often remarked. He was doing well only because of the Ninety One or RMB - Rand Merchant Bank brand. So, Malu started MAZI ASSET MANAGEMENT in 2006 to prove he could be successful on his merit. It was one of the first black-owned and managed hedge funds in S.A. 100% owned by its staff. And it was fitting that he named the firm Mazi, after the Nguni word for ‘cash cow’. Noted for its resilience and a symbol of wealth and status. And today, Mazi is one of the best S.A. equity funds. With 📈 Investments of over $2.5 billion in African and global stocks 🏆Investments awards from Morningstar, Personal Finance's Raging Bull, ABSIP National and HedgeNews Africa 👑One of the largest black-owned-managed entities in S.A’s asset management industry Mazi is invested in MTN Group, Safaricom PLC, airtel Africa, Tencent and many more.

Let me know in the comments 👇🏾\n\nThis African investor has led over $14+ billion worth of buyouts and investments over his investment career. Here are 8 lessons I learned on business building/investing in Africa. From studying Tope Lawani and Helios Investment Partners. 1. Be a First-Principles investor. • Break down 🧩problems into their bare essence. • Rethink🤔each element of the investing process: buying, building, selling. • Focus🎯 on identifying where capital and know-how can solve a problem at a profit. 2. Be a deal maker, not a deal taker. • Avoid 🚫 looking at what is for sale. • Identify 🕵️challenges you can solve to make money. • Make a deal 🤝when an opportunity meets scale and a long-term trend. 3. Be an active investor. • Build 🛠️ a reputation for doing what you say you will do. • Bring 📦significant operating expertise and resources to create value. • Apply 📝a hands-on approach to collaboration with portfolio company management. 4. Invest through the rough times. • Find 🔍companies with natural hedges built in to manage FX risk. • Look 🧐for companies with pricing power that can weather through rough times. • Identify 🕵️companies that are essential in allowing domestic companies to function. 5. Africa is a negotiated market. • Opportunities 🌟 are highly specific. • Understand 🤔 the consumer behavior in countries/sectors you invest in. • Have 🤲 detailed knowledge of both the business and the regulatory environment. 6. Look where the inefficiencies are greatest. • Find 🔍businesses creating efficiencies. • See 👀opportunities where there are delays in a system. • Address📦 inefficiencies by investing in critical infrastructure that solves the problem. 7. Avoid a portfolio approach to investing in Africa. • Bet 🎲on individual companies and entrepreneurs over countries. • Look 🔍for expert fund managers with detailed regional expertise. • Understand 🤔 that local exchanges do not have the liquidity to fit portfolio investors. 8. An exit is a battle that is often won/lost at the time of the investment. • Invest 💰 in businesses solving big problems in big markets. • Have 🤲at least 2 or 3 credible exit strategies before investing. • Set 🔧world-class governance and control systems in businesses to make it easy for future buyers.
