        "text": "SANDY, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PurePredictive (http://www.purepredictive.com), the leading provider of automated machine learning ensemble solutions, today announced the appointment of Dr. Karthik Balakrishnan as PurePredictive’s President.\n\n“The PurePredictive team has built an exciting business opportunity and we are very fortunate to be in a position to benefit from the experience and leadership that Karthik will bring to our organization,” said Mr. Reber, CEO of PurePredictive.\n\nKarthik holds a Ph.D. in machine learning and brings nearly 20 years of experience driving innovative businesses through advanced analytics-based products and solutions. Most recently, he served as the Senior Vice President of Fraud Solutions and Analytics in the Health division of Verisk Analytics, where he had P&L responsibility and also oversaw product innovation and advanced analytics. Prior to his move to the Health division, he directed the Analytics operations at Verisk’s Innovative Analytics center of competency in San Francisco. Karthik has also held analytical leadership roles at Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company and Obongo Inc (a subsidiary of AOL).\n\n“I am a big proponent of the ''toolkit'' approach to analytics – the use of multiple modeling algorithms, often in interesting combinations – to yield highly accurate, stable, and often novel solutions,” said Dr. Balakrishnan. “This drew me to PurePredictive, with its core IP in the automation of ensemble model discovery at big data scale, and I am thrilled to be a part of this innovative technology and a phenomenal team.”\n\nAbout PurePredictive, Inc."
