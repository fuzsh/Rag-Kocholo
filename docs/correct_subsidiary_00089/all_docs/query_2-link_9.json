        "text": "A year ago, I became the first Nigerian, 4th Black woman, and 6th Black student to defend a PhD in Computer Science from the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science at Cornell University! Since then, I‚Äôve started my career at the world‚Äôs foremost think tank, attended numerous prominent convenings, had 50+ speaking engagements, reached 200+ citations of my research, and engaged in collaborations that have produced nearly a dozen research papers, policy commentaries, white papers, and technical reports. Data from the Computing Research Association (CRA) Taulbee Survey, the principal source of information on the enrollment, production, and employment of PhDs in computer science, information science, and computer engineering in North America (United States and Canada), also indicates that I was 1/18 Black students and 1/387 women to graduate with a PhD in Computer Science during the 2022-2023 academic year. While the numbers for women CS PhD graduates have gradually increased over the past decade, the production of Black CS PhD graduates has remained dismal, never exceeding more than 2% of all awarded computer science doctoral degrees in North America. As the world continues to contemplate the harms caused by technical systems, particularly those enabled by AI, how do we reconcile that those most likely to experience disparate impacts continue to be underrepresented in researching, developing, and critically evaluating these systems? This past year has taught me much about myself, both personally and professionally. It has also helped me define the research I want to pursue and the impact I want to make within the fields of AI, global development, and technology governance. Over the next year, I look forward to pursuing new opportunities to scale my impact and create opportunities for marginalized voices to contribute to AI research and shape public policy. Stay tuned!\n\nToday I‚Äôm thrilled to announce the launch of my next venture: Beatrice Advisors. Taking the name from TLC Beatrice International, the barrier-breaking business once owned by my family, Beatrice‚Äôs mission is to provide high-quality financial services to a new generation of wealthy individuals and families. As a next gen woman who‚Äôs worked with asset managers and wealth advisors my entire life, I see a clear opportunity to build a modern, inclusive family office to serve today‚Äôs evolving group of ultra-high net worth individuals and families. I‚Äôve been working on this for over two years. It‚Äôs been harder than I expected and more fun and exhilarating than I ever imagined. Major credit is due to Beatrice President and Chief Investment Officer, Meredith Bowen, and Managing Director and Head of Client Advisory, Michael Hymes, CFP¬Æ, CPWA¬Æ, and the entire Beatrice team for all their hard work and dedication getting us to this day. For more information, read the press release and follow Beatrice Advisors to get real-time updates, including our upcoming launch press in CNBC, Institutional Investor and Forbes. https://lnkd.in/ezH6E_MQ\n\nI‚Äôve been keeping it under wraps the whole year, but I‚Äôm excited to finally announce my startup, Zimi! My co-founder Peter Nsaka and I are bringing Amazon-prime like fulfillment to African exporters - making it easy, fast, and cheap for these businesses to sell internationally. Across the continent, millions of businesses export $600 billion worth of goods every year. This is set to surpass $1 trillion by 2035. But these businesses have no affordable way to sell globally. Shipping can cost more than 100% of the value of an order. That just doesn‚Äôt make sense to us, which is why we‚Äôre building Zimi. By helping companies store inventory across the globe and fulfill orders directly, Zimi is enabling African merchants to cut logistics costs by up to 80% and deliver goods to their buyers in record time. One in every five people of working age runs a business on the continent. Like Amazon transformed logistics for books sold online and eventually almost every other product, Zimi aims to do the same for businesses in Africa. Interested in what we‚Äôre doing? Let‚Äôs talk! Special thank you to Mbwana Alliy from Savannah Fund for being our first believer!\n\nThis Nigerian investor started 1 of the 1st impact investing firms in Africa.

Let me know in the comments. üëá Join my newsletter for more stories on business, markets and investing. https://lnkd.in/d-mDKYRT\n\nHave you ever made a mistake at work that you needed to be forgiven for? Most of us have at some point, we‚Äôre human. In these situations, it‚Äôs easy to bypass conflict to get to forgiveness and peace. But Myisha Cherry, the Director of the Emotion and Society Lab üî¨ at University of California, Riverside, argues that forgiveness is not always the answer. Even when it is, she says the emotions that happen between the mistake and the moment of forgiveness are important to sit with and explore. Feelings like anger and regret don‚Äôt feel good but she says these emotions aren‚Äôt about us feeling good, they‚Äôre about us being good. üí° Paying attention to the signals your emotions send can be a protective mechanism for thriving in the communities we‚Äôre in, whether that be work or in our personal lives. With practical awareness, anger, regret and other emotions will help you avoid making the same choices in the future. ‚ÄúThis pain needs to be what it is so you won't repeat your mistakes,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the way we improve.‚Äù Listen to our conversation about her book (https://lnkd.in/d4DCzK3Y), ‚ÄúFailures of Forgiveness: What We Get Wrong and How to Do Better‚Äù: üéß Spotify: https://lnkd.in/gmS4HkCr üéß Apple: https://lnkd.in/gwiaK5qH"
