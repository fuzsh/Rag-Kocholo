This article describes four add-on sensor boards which can be used with the Flasher to control its flashing rate in response to sound, temperature, light and movement. For example, a proximity sensor sends the Star into its \"shimmer\" mode when someone passes by. You can also talk to the Star, and get a response – kids love shouting at it to \"wake up\"! It is a good \"Christmas Time\" design, which might even allow you to suitably light-up Santa!\n\nSUPER VIBRATION SWITCH This project simulates an old-fashioned vibration switch in which movement of a flexible lever makes contact with an electrical terminal. There are three significant differences, though. First, there is an indicator light, which shows that vibration has been detected. Second, the circuit's output is via a relay, allowing it to be plugged into other circuits having widely varying supply voltages. The real difference, however, lies in its sensitivity. It may justifiably be described as being \"supersensitive\". While the old-fashioned vibration switch is best suited to detecting noticeable motion, this design is capable of picking up very subtle vibrations indeed, depending on its adjustment setting. It will easily pick up a person walking across a wooden floor at virtually any distance (e.g. at the far side of a hall). The author's prototype was capable of picking up a pin striking a wooden floor at two metres distance. It reliably picked up a telephone receiver being put down in the next room!\n\nWIND DIRECTION INDICATOR Although designed originally for the use of yachtsmen, this simple wind direction indicator could equally well find use in an amateur weather monitoring station. The input device is a modified mechanical shaft encoder with 4-bit Gray-coded output. The circuit to which this is attached converts the code to a form suitable for driving 16 l.e.d.s arranged in a circle, from which the prevailing wind direction can be seen clearly.\n\nLIGHT DETECTOR This project makes use of an l.e.d. as a simple light sensor that generates a photovoltage that varies with light intensity. By comparing the photovoltage with a variable reference voltage, the circuit provides a digital output signal that changes state when the monitored light level crosses a preset threshold. The detector also provides visual indication by illuminating the sensor l.e.d. when the light exceeds the preset level. In this way, the l.e.d. provides a dual function, acting as both the sensor and the indicator. An optional, optically-isolated output is also available.\n\nNO ONE DOES IT BETTER DON'T MISS AN ISSUE – PLACE YOUR\n\nORDER NOW!

Interestingly it is also 100 years since Fleming patented the valve (tube for our USA readers) so we have come a long way in that time. PE was one of the first magazines to use printed circuit boards, introduced stripboard to many hobbyists and later published projects employing integrated circuits. Nowadays few of our projects are without i.c.s. and many of them use chips with thousands of components on. The sophistication of the electronics we use has changed dramatically over the years – who would have envisaged students programming microcontrollers for their projects – we introduced our readers to microcontrollers just over ten years ago now; or using a PC as part of a test equipment set-up, or asking about floating point maths for PIC microcontrollers?\n\nThe Future\n\nPredicting the future is always fraught with pitfalls but I do wonder where we will be in another 40 years time – I doubt I will be around to see it and I do wonder if hobbyists will still be able to keep up with cutting edge technology. At the present time it is still possible to restore and repair radio equipment from the 1920s through to the 1970s (as proved by our sister magazine Radio Bygones which, interestingly, has only been around for 15 years – still in “short trousers”!), but items made after that date are much more difficult to service due to the lack of availability of any specialist i.c.s used. Obviously as technology progresses more and more of it becomes “throw away” once it goes wrong. Although, hopefully, breakdowns become less frequent. Maybe our hobby will actually become retro in the future.\n\nAVAILABILITY Copies of EPE are available on subscription anywhere in the world (see opposite), from all UK newsagents (distributed by COMAG) and from the following electronic component retailers: Omni Electronics and Yebo Electronics (S.

This low-cost early warning monitor will indicate the possibility of a thunderstorm in advance of any thunder or lightning, greatly reducing the risk of injury.\n\nT\n\nHERE is at least one good reason why you should consider building a Thunderstorm Monitor. Scientific studies have shown that by the time you hear the most distant rumble of thunder, or see the most distant flash, it may already be too late. You are already within range of the next lightning strike. That is, as humans we are incapable, through our five senses, of receiving timely warning of a possible strike. Two leading lightning researchers in Japan (N. Kitagawa and A. Sugita) recently stated, “It is concluded that there exists no safe time interval during which a human is free from direct strikes.” In keeping with this, it has been shown that a thunderstorm’s danger zone covers a radius of at least sixteen kilometres (or 800 square kilometres’ area) beyond a given lightning strike. A classic example of this is the phrase “bolt from the blue” – that is, a lightning strike under clear skies, which often happens “within range” of a nearby thunderstorm. This phenomenon is so common that it has become an idiom of the English language.\n\nAt Risk\n\nLightning is not an insignificant risk to humans. It causes more deaths than do most other natural hazards, including hurricanes and tornadoes. The author knows several people who experienced near misses from lightning – including his wife, who was once missed by a mere four metres! She was sitting outside to admire the storm at the time. The risk is particularly acute if you should be standing out in the open, or should find yourself on open waters when a thunderstorm approaches. Patrons of golf clubs, soccer clubs, and boating clubs are at particular risk – not to speak of the clubs themselves, which might be held liable for injury or death if they have no early-warning system or lightning safety policy in place. Alas, you are not necessarily safer indoors. Another major cause of lightning strikes on humans is electrical equipment they happen to be handling at the time – a leading offender being the telephone. Moreover, when talking on the phone, you are less likely to hear that distant rumble, or to see a flash, and might quite unwittingly be speaking your “famous last words”. No less than one in four lightning injuries in the UK is caused through the telephone. Having said this, direct strikes on humans are not the only hazard. Lightning poses a significant risk to livestock, forests, power transmission and distribution apparatus, buildings, electrical\n\n760\n\nequipment, and in particular computer equipment. Conventional wisdom until recently held that computer systems should be shut down when lightning approached to within about three kilometres’ radius. This is now considered inadequate, with a minimum of ten kilometres being considered more realistic.\n\nPrinciple of Operation\n\nThere are two broad approaches to lightning detection. The design presented here represents the less common of the two. The most common approach is to detect electromagnetic pulses emitted by lightning flashes, and this is the method most often used by meteorological (met) offices. However, while it is very effective, it is still by no means a failsafe warning system – the reason being that it relies on the detection of prior lightning discharges. That is, if you should be extraordinarily unlucky, the first large discharge of a storm might be the one to strike you! The alternative is to monitor atmospheric charge – or, related to this, instability of atmospheric charge. The present circuit takes the approach of detecting and reporting an unusually high charge on the atmosphere – or rather, an unusually high potential difference between the atmosphere and the earth. At first the author sought to detect instability of atmospheric charge, which is typical of a building thunderstorm. This instability may in some cases be considerable.\n\nEveryday Practical Electronics, November 2004\n\nBut since lightning strikes average only one per square kilometre per annum in his home city Cape Town, he felt that he did not have sufficient “material” to turn out a dependable and repeatable circuit. However, not much is lost by this, since it is not a given phenomenon that thunderstorm activity will cause significant unsteadiness of atmospheric charge – and conversely, ordinary cumulus clouds, and sometimes sudden and unexplained shifts in atmospheric charge may be reported by a circuit as instability – not to mention people walking past the antenna, or electromagnetic pulses (e.g. fluorescent lighting) in the vicinity. What seemed to be the most dependable indicator of a looming thunderstorm was the overall level of atmospheric charge, which was thought to offer fair warning of potential lightning strikes. After all, without a significant potential difference between the atmosphere and the earth, there can be no lightning strike. Usually this potential difference covers a large part of the sky, so that the Thunderstorm Monitor would report a raised charge many tens of kilometres away from the epicentre of any electrical activity. In theory, therefore, the circuit should have a range well beyond that of our five senses. However, it needs to be borne in mind that sometimes a raised atmospheric charge may be localised, and the potential difference between the atmosphere and the earth can change very quickly (that is, within minutes) as a charged thunderhead races across the landscape.\n\nObservations\n\nThe author found one common factor between most of the storms which he monitored. This was a greatly increased charge on the atmosphere, which easily exceeded the average daily maximum. On an average day, at sea level, the average daily minimum charge will be roughly 100V per metre elevation, and the average daily maximum charge roughly 135V. When there is thunderstorm activity nearby, atmospheric charge may rise to hundreds if not thousands of volts per metre elevation. The present circuit switches a relay (and any alarm attached to it) when an estimated 170V per metre elevation is detected – i.e. twice the average daily maximum variation. This avoids meaningless triggering on the one hand, yet is very responsive on the other. In most cases, the Thunderstorm Monitor picked up the possibility of a thunderstorm well in advance of any thunder or lightning. However, in two cases, atmospheric charge remained unexpectedly low (about 125V per metre elevation), while lightning was seen over the Atlantic at a few kilometres’ distance. Whether these “phantom” thunderstorms would have represented any real danger is unknown, although it is thought unlikely. In one case, such lightning preceded a “real” thunderstorm which moved in about an hour later. It would therefore seem that, just as there are dangerous situations where no danger is perceived, there may be lightning and thunder within several kilometres’ distance which represents no immediate dan-\n\nFig.1. Different atmospheric activity graphs. Most days the atmospheric change meanders slowly up and down (a); on cloudy days it’s more “lumpy” (b); at times the readings become very lively without a storm, likely indicating electrical activity at a distance (c); occasionally, unexplained “quantum leaps” of charge occur (d). A breaking thunderstorm is shown in (e) and a high speed record of a thunderstorm directly overhead is shown at (f). ger. It would seem a shame, for instance, to call off a wedding reception because of some rumbling in the sky, when the atmospheric charge in fact remains within the normal daily variation.\n\nActivity Log\n\nAtmospheric activity was monitored on and off for a year, by means of a computer logger attached to IC1 output pin 6 (solder pin C in Fig.4). In practice, this output voltage is “clamped” between 1.48V and 4.16V – nonetheless, the results are very informative. (In contrast, the final prototype described here offers a full scale deflection readout.) Different vertical (atmospheric charge) and horizontal (time) axes are shown in the graphs of Fig.1a to Fig.1f. On most days, atmospheric charge meanders slowly and steadily up and down (Fig.1a). On cloudy days, the graph is more “lumpy”, with cumulus clouds in particular raising the atmospheric charge (Fig.1b). There are times when readings become very lively, even without a storm. Often such episodes are on a small scale, measuring less than 0.1V (Fig.1c), likely indicating electrical activity at a distance. Occasionally, inexplicable “quantum leaps” of charge occur (Fig.1d). The jagged ascending patterns of Fig.1e show a thunderstorm breaking, and finally, Fig.1f is a high speed record of a thunderstorm directly overhead (note that recording this was not without risk to the author’s logger and computer system).\n\nEveryday Practical Electronics, November 2004\n\nDuring a thunderstorm, a negative charge builds up in the lower regions of the clouds in relation to the earth. When the electrical difference between a thundercloud and the ground overcomes the insulating properties of the surrounding air, a cloud-to-ground lightning strike occurs, with the cloud discharging to earth. Not all strikes are of this nature, however, with many lightning flashes occurring within the clouds themselves, and a few strikes (about 10%) discharging from earth-tocloud. When a cloud discharges to earth, atmospheric charge, within milliseconds, will dramatically drop, then rapidly return close to its original level. Not only does the charge drop beneath the cloud itself, but it may drop across the entire visible atmosphere. During observations, it was noted that variations in atmospheric charge frequently predicted weather conditions – in particular, giving a good indication of likely flooding at the complex where the author works. This has him puzzled as to why weather stations seldom, if ever, incorporate measurements of atmospheric charge.\n\nBlock Diagram\n\nThe block schematic diagram for the Thunderstorm Monitor is shown in Fig.2. It begins with a 5V regulator (IC4), which is required to provide a suitable voltage for IC1 in particular, and to ensure stability for what is a very sensitive circuit.\n\n761\n\nThe “engine room” of the circuit is represented by comparator IC1, which includes an antenna and an earth. Note that the circuit is ground referenced (the earth), since one is measuring the potential difference between the atmosphere and the ground. Atmospheric charge monitors are often complex circuits – however, this does not have to be the case, as this circuit shows. Beyond IC1, all the rest of the circuit merely provides an “interface” to the user. A number of options exist for the interface, one of which is a three-stage bargraph (IC2b to IC2d), which is translated to a three-stage dot-mode “traffic light” l.e.d. display by means of decoder IC3 (an 8way bilateral switch). Therefore, when atmospheric charge is low (within daily averages), a Green l.e.d. illuminates. When it is raised, an Amber l.e.d. illuminates. When it is high, a Red l.e.d. illuminates. Further, when the red l.e.d. is on, a relay is triggered. A relay was chosen here above, say, a pulsed alarm at the output, since one might wish to use the Thunderstorm Monitor in situations where a more powerful alarm would be required, or to switch other circuits. Further options are provided to attach a VU meter, a 100µA meter, or a 200mV digital meter. In this case, IC2a is used as a buffer, to prevent the output of IC1 from being skewed through undue loading. These meters all provide full scale deflection (f.s.d.), as described below. The moving coil meters in particular give a very useful visual impression of atmospheric instability. As a thunderstorm approaches, even at a distance, they may visibly begin to twitch. A high impedance multimeter or computer logger may also be attached either at the output of IC1 – in which case the output voltage is “clamped” as described above – or may be attached to the output of IC2a (see below).\n\nCircuit Details\n\nThe author first encountered the present approach to lightning detection in an electronics publication of 1965. The core of this circuit is shown in all its magnificent detail in Fig.3. This represents a simple potential divider, with the potential at the emitter varying with atmospheric charge. The original circuit added a meter at the output. The germanium transistor, which is now obsolete, was evidently very carefully selected. However, unsatisfactory results were obtained with a modern-day equivalent and therefore, a j.f.e.t. op.amp, wired as a simple comparator, was tried and produced very good results. With the prototype antenna being about 2.2m in height, the voltage at the tips of the antenna must be in the region of 220V to 300V. However, atmospheric current is so small (a mere 2 picoamps per square metre), and the input impedance of most test equipment so low (relatively speaking), that this voltage is practically unmeasurable. If, however, input impedance is raised sufficiently, a meaningful result can be obtained, although with much reduced voltage.\n\n762\n\nFig. 2. Block diagram for the Thunderstorm Monitor. The full circuit diagram for the Thunderstorm Monitor is shown in Fig. 4. The TL071CN j.f.e.t. op.amp i.c. was chosen for IC1, chiefly for its high input impedance of around 1T, or 50pA. This reduces atmospheric charge at 2.2 metres’ height to an estimated 1V at the noninverting input (IC1 pin 3). By way of comparison, if one were to use a 741 op.amp instead, one would measure nothing at all, even though its open loop voltage gain is very similar to that of the TL071CN. All of the charge would be lost “down the tip” of the op.amp’s hungry non-inverting input (about 700nA). At the very height of a thunderstorm, the input voltage at IC1 pin 3 may rise quite high – potentially higher than the supply voltage of IC1 – and IC1 could be at risk. Yet such a situation should be rare. If protection circuitry were added at the input, this would drain away precious picoamps, which this circuit cannot afford. In a worst case scenario, the Thunderstorm Monitor could trigger an alarm for a while – then blow out! The TL071CN i.c.’s open loop voltage gain (106dB) is almost perfectly suited to measuring atmospheric charge – yet it is a little on the high side, which causes output voltage swings which are a little too wild. Therefore, a small amount of feedback is\n\napplied in the form of resistor R1 to reduce the gain.\n\nUser Interface\n\nVirtually all of the rest of the circuit represents standard electronics. Operational amplifiers IC1b to IC1d form a simple three-stage bargraph circuit (see Teach-In 2004, EPE April 2004), whose outputs read binary 100, 110, or 111. These binary numbers are decoded to decimal through IC3, an 8-way bilateral switch , giving the “traffic light” display mentioned earlier. An additional stage (binary 000) would be available through IC3 pin 13. Ballast resistor R7 is inserted before the common terminal (pin 3) of the bilateral switch. The three op.amps IC1b to IC1d are used in preference over a standard bargraph i.c., since their resistor chain R3 to R6 may be adjusted to order. As shown, the green l.e.d. D3 begins to illuminate when IC1’s output rises to around 1·9V (or a little more), the amber l.e.d. D4 when it rises to around 2·9V, and the red l.e.d. D5 when it rises to around 3·5V. There is just a little overlap between the l.e.d. colours displayed. The binary 111 output (decimal 7), at IC3 pin 4, is further used to switch a relay (RLA) via transistor TR1. In order to overcome any relay judder as amber switches to red, capacitor C1 is inserted at IC3 pin 4. The specified d.p.c.o. sub-miniature relay is rated at 2A, with a maximum switched voltage of 220V d.c. or 250V a.c. per set of contacts (two sets of contacts are twinned on the printed circuit board, thus raising the rating to 4A). Other 5V relays may be pressed into service here provided a protection diode is included against backe.m.f. , and, of course, the contact ratings are able to handle the requirements of any additional alarm device being used.\n\nMonitoring Meter\n\nFig.3.

This has been incorporated in the prototype model, and provided for in the circuit diagram. As already mentioned, the output voltage of IC1 is “clamped” between 1·48V and 4·16V, while ideally a meter would have full scale deflection (f.s.d.). With this in mind, op.amp IC2a serves as a buffer, which prevents the current drain of the meter from skewing the ouput voltage of IC1. Diodes D1 and D2 serve to drop virtually all of the “dead zone” below 1·9V. Resistor R2 and preset VR3 then adjust the current through the meter. The meter may be a Fig. 5. Adding a VU meter (a), a standard VU meter (Fig.5a) 100Am meter (b) or a 200mA digital or a 100µA d.c. moving voltmeter/multimeter. coil meter (Fig.5b). Note that the value of R2 is 4k7 and the value of VR3 10k for a VU meter, and the value of R2 is 10k and the value of VR3 20k for a 100µA meter. If R2 is replaced with a 47k resistor, and if the meter is replaced with a link wire, and if the short link wire beside preset VR3 is removed from the p.c.b. (see Fig.7), then with the VR3 wiper being taken to a 200mV digital voltmeter, one would obtain a digital readout (Fig.5c). This same arrangement could also feed a multimeter or computer logger set to its 200mV scale. Finally, a common 7805 +5V voltage regulator (IC4) is used. This will accept a supply voltage between 7V and 35Vd.c. The Thunderstorm Monitor’s power consumption (without an integral meter) is typically 15mA, therefore a quality plug-pack power supFig.4.

This board is available from the EPE PCB Service, code 470. The p.c.b. topside component layout and full-size underside copper foil master are shown in Fig.6. The author’s prototype worked satisfactorily in an ABS plastic case, although a metal case, connected to 0V on the p.c.b., would help stabilise performance in electrically “noisy” situations. By way of preparation, take preset VR1, and adjust it about half way – that is, to about 500k. Preset VR1 serves merely to match temperature coefficients, and once it has been soldered into place, is not touched again. A 470k resistor could serve just as well here, but could cause a little drift if not temperature matched with preset VR2. In its simplest form, only R1, VR1 and VR2, C2 and C3, IC1 and IC4 , as well as i.c. sockets and the various link wires and solder pins need to be soldered into place. This would be sufficient to monitor atmospheric charge with a high impedance multimeter or computer logger attached to solder pin C (TP1). The “next step up” would be to add an integral meter (ME1) or a 200mV voltmeter, for which R2, VR3, D1, D2, and IC2 (and the required 14-pin i.c. socket) would need to be inserted on the p.c.b. However, a meter, unless taken e.g. from old hi-fi equipment, may cost significantly, and this whole section of the circuit may therefore be omitted. The author used an old VU meter (250µA) with backlight, taken from a junked hi-fi system.\n\nFig.7. Modification to the p.c.b. wiring so that a 200mV digital voltmeter can be used. This same arrangement could also feed a multimeter or computer logger set to its 200mV scale.\n\n764\n\nLayout of components on the completed circuit board. Depending on the option selected, take note of the component values shown in Fig.5a to Fig.5c. If a voltmeter is used, then the link wire next to preset VR3 needs to be omitted (see Fig.5), and an additional link wire inserted between VR3 and solder pin E as shown. The meter’s control wire is taken to the solder pin marked CONT.

The author found it easiest first to mount the necessary off-board components on the case with trailing wires, then to take these wires to the respective solder pins on the p.c.b. The 0V terminals of the off-board components may be commoned before taking a single wire to the p.c.b. The antenna is attached to solder pin A on the p.c.b., and the ground wire (the screen) to solder pin B. These connections must be very secure.\n\nFig. 6.

These seven copper “javelins” are each 70mm long from the point at which they separate from their base, and they form a 70mm diameter circle at their tips in an “umbrella fashion”. At their base, the copper “javelins” are soldered to the core of a 15m to 20m length of quality screened microphone cable. This must have a good screen, which cheap substitutes sometimes do not have. The cable’s core, at the antenna end of the cable, together with its insulation, protrudes from the screen by 100mm as shown. That is, 100mm of the outer screen and outer insulation is cut away – see Fig.8. The copper “javelins” are fixed into the top of a length of p.v.c. piping by inserting them in a bung, and fixing this in the pipe with some epoxy glue. The microphone cable is then tied to the pipe with a cable tie to secure it.

Construction details for the prototype antenna.\n\n765\n\nmounted about 2·2m (at its tips) off the ground, and preferably half a metre or more away from any exterior wall. It is of no consequence whether it is located in an open or leafy area, so long as it does not come into direct contact with flora. Directly beneath the antenna, at the ground, a section of the microphone cable’s screen is exposed (to “show through” the insulation), and is securely connected to a metal stake in the ground (see photograph). The metal stake is hammered half a metre or more into the ground. For safety purposes, the remaining length of microphone cable (several metres) is buried in the ground, and its far end taken to the Thunderstorm Monitor printed circuit board. While these safety measures would probably be unnecessary, it would be preferable to err on the safe side. If the Thunderstorm Monitor should be used in a block of flats, the most sensible way to go would be to mount the aerial and earth on the ground (again burying part of the cable in the ground), and to run a quality, screened microphone cable up to the circuit in one’s flat. Bear in mind, though, that there might be more electromagnetic interference in a block of flats, and e.g. the operation of a washing machine next door could seriously upset the Monitor.\n\nNow you are ready to do an initial calibration of the “traffic light” readout. A multimeter is not essential to setting up, but it would be helpful. While monitoring the voltage at test point TP1 (C), turn back preset VR2 (anticlockwise). At a certain point (about 3·5V), red l.e.d. D5 should extinguish, and the relay disengage. At the same time, amber l.e.d. D4 should illuminate – then this should extinguish at about 2·9V. Then green l.e.d. D3 should illuminate, and finally it should flicker on the edge of going out. The voltage at test point TP1 should, at this point, read just over 1·9V. Note that over most of its range, preset VR2 will show more than 4V or less than 1·6V, and one needs to find the narrow “band” where the voltage at IC1 output pin 6 (at solder pin C) hovers between these two extremes. After this will come several days if not weeks of observation. If atmospheric charge dips so low that green l.e.d. D3 extinguishes, which it almost certainly will do at first, VR2 needs to be turned up further (clockwise) until D3 again just illuminates. This needs to be repeated only when l.e.d. D3 extinguishes – for the rest, VR2\n\nSetting Up and Use\n\nThe Thunderstorm Monitor is best set up by trial and error. In fact, there would be hardly any other way to establish the average daily minimum and maximum atmospheric charge in a particular area. First of all, before applying power, turn back VR3 (anticlockwise) as far as it will go. This would typically be 25 full turns at the most. Turn up (clockwise) VR2 as far as it will go (again, typically 25 turns). Then connect the power supply. The red l.e.d. should illuminate, and the relay click closed. If you are using a meter, turn up preset VR3 until the meter reaches its maximum deflection – or until it reaches 200mV if a voltmeter is used (or whatever maximum figure you might wish to use, e.g. 100mV).\n\nUsing a G-clamp to secure the Monitor’s “earth” lead against the metal “ground” stake.\n\n766\n\nCompleted antenna head. (e.g. if you should live on the edge of an escarpment), you could reduce the value of feedback resistor R1 to compress a greater range of atmospheric charge into the same l.e.d. display, or you could adjust the resistor chain R3 to R6 as seems to best suit your situation. As an example, red l.e.d. D5 presently illuminates (in theory) at: 5V:(R4+R5+R6); R3+R4+R5+R6) which equals 3·47V at test point TP1(C). Amber l.e.d. D4 illuminates (in theory) at 5V:(R5+R6); (R3+R4+R5+R6) which equals 2·9V at TP1. The values of the resistors could thus be adjusted to change the result of the formula. As far as possible, keep the Thunderstorm Monitor and its antenna away from any a.c. mains wiring and appliances, and away from human activity. For the less patient among us, the circuit may initially be tested by critically adjusting preset VR2 to display both green and amber (l.e.d.s D3 and D4) at the transition between the two l.e.d.s. Atmospheric charge is unlikely to remain at the same level for long, with one or the other l.e.d. extinguishing – likely within a few minutes. This would confirm that the unit is working.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nneeds to be left alone. Note again that VR1 merely serves the purpose of matching temperature coefficients, and should be left alone. Do not adjust the circuit during rain or drizzle, or when the ground is wet. Under such conditions, further adjustment needs to be temporarily suspended, no matter what the status of l.e.d. D3. In the end, one will have an adjustment for the green l.e.d. D3 that more or less corresponds with the daily minimum atmospheric charge – although there may be exceptional days where it dips still lower. Ordinarily, after adjustment is complete, the Thunderstorm Monitor will nearly always show green. Occasionally, in the author’s environment, it showed amber – namely every so many days or weeks, depending on the weather. A red l.e.d. (D5) is a definite indication of an unusually high atmospheric charge, although this need not be accompanied by a thunderstorm. Your own environment or microclimate might be more prone to thunderstorms or high atmospheric charge, and the circuit might behave differently to how it did for the author. If your area is particularly “volatile”\n\nThe US National Lightning Safety Institute warns, “Beware of a false sense of confidence from detectors. None of them will detect all of the lightning all of the time.” The first recommendation of the Institute is – rent a meteorologist! This is apparently the best way to go if you should wish to be free from public liability in particular (apart from any injuries or deaths)! Having said this, the thunderstorm Monitor will without doubt greatly reduce the risk of injury or death by lightning strike, not to mention the interesting observations of atmospheric charge it will provide. A final anecdote should well illustrate the inability of humans to assess the likelihood of lightning through our five senses alone. In the early stages of testing, the Thunderstorm Monitor indicated to the author that a thunderstorm should be overdue. The atmospheric charge had risen unusually high. When no thunder was heard, he walked outside onto the veranda. It was a cool evening, with mist rolling in from the sea – hardly the weather, he thought, for a thunderstorm. Yet while he was still peering into the mist, thunder rumbled across the sky. $\n\nEveryday Practical Electronics, November 2004\n\nNews . . .\n\nA roundup of the latest Everyday News from the world of electronics\n\nBLUE IS THE COLOUR TO WATCH Blue lasers can double the playing time of CDs – but is there a colour battle with the reds? asks Barry Fox HE electronics giants are gearing up for the fight to make blue laser recordT ing the next big thing. There are two systems (Blu-Ray and HD-DVD) which are every bit as incompatible and impossible to combine as VHS and Beta. The fight is also turning into a show down between traditional electronics companies. Now there is a third contender in the ring. Clever new technology currently reaching the shops doubles the recording time of today's red laser DVD recorders, by letting the disc record twice on the same side. These new double length home recordings will play back on the millions of DVD players already sitting in homes round the world. So consumers will soon have to choose between two completely new and incompatible blue systems that record a lot, and a compatible red system that records a bit less.\n\nDual-Layered Scenario VHS has been around so long that most people forget how it works. Slow moving magnetic tape is scanned by a rapidly rotating head. Although one cassette can store several hours of analogue video, the picture and sound quality is poor when compared to digital DVD. Rewinding the tape takes an age, and finding recordings lost in the middle is infuriating, especially when compared to skipping the laser over the surface of a CD or DVD. DVD uses a red laser to record 4·7GB of digital data on each side of a 12cm disc. The disc is made by gluing together two separately pressed – halves of a sandwich, each 0·6mm thick. Even with digital MPEG compression, 4·7GB is not enough to hold a feature length movie in full quality, with surround sound. Splitting the movie between two sides of the disc is possible, but there is nowhere to put the label and the viewer must get up from the sofa and turn the disc over half way through the movie.\n\nSkipping The Light So right from Day One the DVD standard has provided for dual layer recording. Two completely different recordings are pressed into the disc material, at slightly different depths, giving a total capacity of 8·5GB, which is enough for even the longest movie. The laser in the player skips focus from one layer to the other, half way through. There may be a slight jerk in the action on screen, but few people notice.\n\nSo far dual layer technology has only worked for movie discs pressed in factories. Now Philips, working with Mitsubishi Chemical and its subsidiary Verbatim, has found a way to make dual layer DVD recordings in the home, on a computer burner or consumer deck. The first burners go on sale in a few weeks for just 169 Euros. Home recorders, like VCRs, will go on sale before the end of the year. \"Our target is for dual layer blank discs to cost around :1·5 the price of today's single layer blanks\" says Wim Koppers of the Philips Research lab which developed the system. Single layer blanks already sell for around $1 and the price is falling. So recording to DVD will soon be a lot cheaper than VHS – as well as giving better pictures and sound and being much more fun.\n\nTall Order Making a laser burn two recordings just 55 micrometres apart in depth was a very tall order. Both the recording layers are made from a dye which changes shape and colour when heated by a laser. The upper layer has to absorb half the laser light while it is recording, and let through half the light when the laser is refocused to record onto the lower layer. Both layers need a silver alloy coating to reflect light during playback. But the reflective coating must also let through enough light to allow recording. So far the dual layer home system only works with write-once blanks, but Philips believes it can later make dual layer erasables. Whether this is needed, is a moot point, though. If write-once blanks are cheap enough, most people will not bother to reuse erasables – just as few people bother to reuse audio or video tapes.\n\nBlu-Ray Tomorrow's blue laser systems use the tighter focus of the shorter wavelength light to store around 20GB on a 12cm disc. This is good news for people in the USA and Japan who want to record the high definition TV services there. But for most viewers with ordinary TV, the prospect of buying a completely new and expensive recording system, just to get more time on a disc, is not appealing. Industry infighting makes it even less appealing. All the traditional consumer electronic companies, led by Philips, Sony, Matsushita (Panasonic) and Sharp, are backing a system called Blu-Ray. The disc\n\nEveryday Practical Electronics, November 2004\n\nis single-sided, the same size (12cm) as a CD or DVD and the same thickness, 1·2mm. But the recording layer is only 0·1mm thick. The laser only has to \"see\" through a very thin layer, so there is less risk of beam distortion if the disc is out of true. Blu-Ray stores around 25GB. Because the discs are so different, new pressing plants are needed. Toshiba and NEC came up with HDDVD. Double-sided discs are made like DVDs by gluing two 0·6mm discs back-toback. So HD-DVD discs can be pressed on modified DVD presses. But the laser has to see through 0·6mm of plastics, and beam distortion is more of a problem. So HDDVD softens focus and reduces storage capacity to 20GB per side. The DVD Forum, which sets the standards for DVD, has been comparing the two different basic approaches – 0·6mm and 0·1mm. After a change in voting rules, and massed support for HD-DVD from Microsoft, IBM and Intel, HD-DVD won by one vote.\n\nOfficial Standard Officially, HD-DVD is now the future blue laser standard. But the Blu-Ray group says it will go ahead anyway, because BluRay is so different from DVD that it does not need the Forum's blessing. Sony is already test-marketing Blu-Ray recorders in Japan. The new systems have only one thing in common; the potential to make better copies of more music and movies. This is terrible news for Hollywood which has used the short recording time of home disc blanks as a practical weapon against piracy. By spreading a movie over the two layers of a single side, the studios can stop people setting a recorder running before going out to the pub, to find a completed digital clone when they get back. Now that DVD blanks can match the capacity of a pressed movie disc, unattended cloning is possible. Says Ted Shapiro, General Counsel for Motion Picture Association: \"We aren't against new technology – the DVD is proof that we have embraced it. We are against misuse of new technologies. The DVD system already has copy-protection and the makers of all recorders, single or dual layer, are obliged by their licences to use it. We shall do whatever we can to stop anyone selling any hardware of software that defeats it.\"\n\n767\n\nValve Centenary On 16 November 1904 Dr John Ambrose Fleming filed his patent application for United Kingdom Patent No. 24,850 – one of the greatest British inventions, generally known now as a \"valve\" (\"tube\" in some parts of the world). It functioned as a diode. Although the rectifying action of an evacuated chamber containing a heated filament and an independent electrode was discovered by Thomas Edison, he did not know what to do with it. Fleming applied the \"Edison Effect\" to the new technique of wireless telegraphy. Fleming's patents show that much of his work was carried out in conjunction with Marconi. In association with Marconi's company he even filed a patent for a portable two-way wireless – drawn by one or more horses! The filed Provisional Specification of Fleming's valve patent was entitled Improvement in Instruments for Detecting and Measuring Alternating Electrical Currents, in which: \"I John Ambrose Fleming of University College, Gower Street, in the County of London, Doctor of Science, do hereby declare the nature of this invention ... to provide a means by which an ordinary galvanometer can be used to detect and measure alternating electric currents and especially high-frequency alternating currents commonly known as electric oscillations. \"... In a glass bulb, I seal two or more carbon filaments such as are used for the manufacture of electric lamps. These filaments have their own separate terminals ... A high vacuum must be made in the bulb. Two such bulbs are employed ... each associated with a small insulated primary or secondary battery of sufficient voltage to bring one of the filaments to bright incandescence of greater intrinsic brilliancy than if used as an incandescent lamp. The bulbs are connected in parallel with each other and inserted in the alternating current circuit ... In series with one of the bulbs is placed an ordinary galvanometer ...” A hundred years – and look where we are now. Would Fleming recognise any of it? Well, probably, because improvements on his valve continue to be in widespread use and development, despite the dominance of semiconductors. It has been said, of course, that had Fleming not invented the valve, the already-known attributes of basic semiconductor crystals might have been developed earlier and more significantly, rather than having to wait several decades, resulting in the transistor being invented, and first introduced to the world in 1947.\n\nDoncaster Aeroventure The Doncaster Aeroventure Military & Aviation Electronics Mart takes place on Sunday 31 October 2004 at the S.Y.A.M.

Zener and the Art of Voltage Regulation I want to switch on a circuit with a supply voltage if it reaches a predetermined threshold voltage. For example, I only want the circuit to be powered from a variable power source if the voltage exceeds 9V or so. Also, can I ask a definite newbie question… what are Zener diodes? What do they do? Posted by DanH in the EPE Chat Zone. Our Internet message board at www. epemag.wimborne.co.uk is simple to use and is an open forum where you can discuss electronics-related topics. In this month's Circuit Surgery we examine current flow and diode terminology for beginners, explaining how to use Zener diodes along the way.\n\nbased semiconductor diode displays a forward voltage (Vf) of roughly 0.7V when conducting current. In the case of a standard l.e.d., the forward voltage is typically 1.8V to 2V, and as an added bonus the device emits light when conducting as well! Using a voltmeter to check for a correct forward voltage is an easy way of testing a diode.\n\nIncrease the forward voltage even more, and the plotted line shows us that after a certain point the forward voltage is fairly constant regardless of the level of forward current passing through the diode. In this condition, circuit designers have to ensure that the forward current is limited to a safe value that prevents the destruction of the diode, e.g. by using a series currentlimiting resistor. The left-hand side of the graph shows us what happens when the diode is reverse biased. In this mode the “forward voltage”\n\nA 1N4148 signal diode.\n\nA 5·8V (5V8) Zener diode.\n\nFig.1. Symbol and apperance of a diode and Zener diode. A diode is a “unidirectional” device, i.e. it allows current to flow in one direction only. Diodes have countless applications in most electronic circuitry. A semiconductor diode has two terminals as shown in Fig.1. Current can flow through the diode in the direction from anode (a) to cathode (k) in its forward-biased mode, but in the reverse direction, current will be blocked; in this latter state the diode is said to be reverse biased. A small sensitive diode designed for use with radio or audio signals, for instance, is classed as a signal diode whilst a heavierduty diode as used in e.g. power supply rectification is termed a rectifier. More important characteristics to note: a silicon-\n\n770\n\nThere is always a maximum permissible forward current (If(max)) stated by the manufacturer, which if exceeded may destroy the device. This may be anything from a few milliamps for a signal diode to tens of amps for a rectifier. And in the reversebiased mode, there is a limit called the Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) which if exceeded will cause the diode to break down and possibly be destroyed.\n\nFig.2a. Voltage characteristic of a silicon diode.\n\nLines and Curves In Fig.2a. we show a simple graph that explains the voltage characteristics of an ordinary silicon diode. These graphs are sometimes called characteristic curves. If you're unsure how to interpret it, the top right quadrant shows the positive (forward biased) situation. As the diode's forward voltage starts to increase (move right from the centre, along the horizontal axis) the current through the diode (vertical axis) starts to rise.\n\nFig.2b. Characteristic curve of a Zener diode.\n\nEveryday Practical Electronics, November 2004\n\nseems to be negative, which occurs when the polarity of the voltage across the diode is reversed. As we move towards the lefthand side of the graph, the inverse voltage increases to the point when avalanche breakdown eventually occurs and a large reverse current flows, when the device may possibly be destroyed. A Zener diode is designed to operate in the reverse breakdown region but without the catastrophic effect of total breakdown. The Zener symbol is shown in Fig.1. and the characteristic curve in Fig.2b. When forward biased, Zener diodes behave just like an ordinary diode, but by deliberately reverse biasing it, a reasonably stable reference voltage can be produced when a Zener diode conducts usefully in the Zener breakdown region.\n\nHow to use a Zener In Fig.3 the simplest Zener application is shown. A supply voltage (Vs) is placed across the Zener, which has an all-important limiting resistor R1 placed in series, without which the device will be destroyed. VOUT is the voltage that appears across the Zener diode, which can be used to drive subsequent circuitry. It is very easy and cheap to produce a modest stabilised (or regulated) voltage this way.\n\n(Far left) Stud-mounted diode . (left) Stud-mounted Zener diode. (above) Stud-mounted rectifier diode. Using a 9.1V Zener in Fig.3, if we had, for example, an +18V supply voltage, then the voltage that we must lose or “drop” across resistor R1 is 8.9V. If the maximum current allowed through the Zener is 55mA, then using the formula R = V/I the absolute minimum resistor value should be 162 ohms. The resistor will dissipate V2/R or just under 500mW so a half-watt resistor would just suffice. As a rule of thumb, a minimum of 10% of the total current should flow through the Zener leaving the rest available to the load (say 50mA). You can increase the value of the series resistor as desired, but allow say 5mA to 10mA as a minimum diode current. Designing using rough rules of thumb is perfectly adequate for simple circuits like this, but bear in mind the 5% tolerance on D1, and allow for minimum load current/ maximum Zener current situations.\n\nEmitter follower Fig.3. How to connect a Zener diode as a voltage reference. The Zener is reversed-biased as shown. Even if the supply voltage varies, the Zener voltage remains the same within reason, and the resistor \"takes up\" any excess voltage. The entire current drawn from the supply also remains at a fixed level. Some of this current flows through the conducting Zener and the rest is taken by the load connected to the VOUT terminal. This means that when the load draws no current at all, the Zener diode has to be powerful enough to allow the total current to pass through it instead. The most popular Zener diodes are the BZY55C or old BZY88C range which have a power rating of 500mW, whilst the larger BZX85C (formerly the BZY61C) has a higher 1 . 3W rating. Voltages available are 2.7V through to 33V or more. It should be noted that a tolerance of ±5% exists so they are not too precise but are good enough for many purposes. According to the formula P=IV, power (P in watts) = Current (I in amps):Voltage (in volts), so the maximum power dissipation allowed in a Zener diode is the voltage across the device (the Zener voltage) multiplied by the current flowing through it. A typical 9.1V 500mW Zener diode, for example, therefore has a maximum allowable current of (I= P/V) of just 55mA.\n\nIn order to increase the current value and reduce Zener power dissipation, a simple emitter follower set-up can be used as shown in Fig.4. The transistor TR1 can be a low or medium power npn device with, say a 500mA or 1A collector current rating (e.g. 2N2222 or 2N3019). The transistor conducts and the Zener voltage is connected to its base (b) terminal. A 0.6V voltage drop is present between TR1's base and emitter (e) – the emitter \"follows\" the voltage at the base in this mode, less a diode voltage drop.\n\nThe choice of transistor needs some attention: its power rating and collector current must handle the worst-case current drawn by the load. The transistor's power dissipation (P=IV) is the voltage across it multiplied by the load current through the device. Assuming an 18V input voltage, an 8.5V output voltage and (say) a 100mA load current, the power dissipated by TR1 would be 950 milliwatts. A 2N3439 has a rating of 1W and could just about suffice with heatsinking: a better way might be to use a Darlington transistor configuration for TR1. This would reduce the current from the Zener network, and allow a lower power transistor to drive a higher power device. However, using a Darlington pair would mean that 1.2V (two diode drops) would be deducted from the Zener voltage.\n\nSwitch-back Back to the reader's question. If a circuit were only supposed to switch on above a certain supply voltage, the basic transistorboosted circuit might be worth experimenting with. The Zener would only start to conduct once the supply exceeded (say) 9.1V, but TR1 would only conduct once there was sufficient base current available. For a cleaner switching action, a Zener diode could be used with a comparator (even a simple 741 op.amp) which could be used to trigger at a preset voltage and turn on a load. Also consider using a three terminal variable voltage regulator such as the LM317. These have a drop-out voltage of about 3V or so, which means that the input must be 3V higher than the output before the regulator can conduct. Hence the load cannot be powered up until the supply rail has exceeded a certain level. A.R.W. ● Starting\n\nin the next Circuit Surgery, we'll be examining the Universal Serial Bus (USB), describing the specification of the versatile USB port used on almost all modern personal computers.\n\nFig.4. Using an external npn “pass” transistor to increase the currect available from the Zener. Hence a 9.1V Zener produces an 8.5V regulated voltage at TR1 emitter, and TR1's base current is the Zener's load current. Usefully, an electrolytic capacitor placed across D1 smoothes out noise and ripple. The transistor's gain has the effect of amplifying the capacitor's value, so it is similar to placing a much larger electrolytic across the output rails.\n\nEveryday Practical Electronics, November 2004\n\nCircuit Surgery will wherever possible offer advice or pointers to readers, but we cannot guarantee to do so, and the ease with which queries can be sent by email does nothing to help!

(Hons) A handy tool for tri-state monitoring of logic circuits\n\nW\n\nHEN troubleshooting digital circuits, a logic probe provides a quick and easy way of determining the logic level at a particular node. Unlike voltmeters and oscilloscopes which are able to display a range of analogue voltage levels, the logic probe is essentially a digital instrument that provides a simple yet unambiguous “yes” or “no” indication of the node’s logic level. Unlike many commercially available logic probes, the one described in this article is a precision instrument, in that it uses analogue techniques to sense the voltage levels, thereby providing an accurate indication of the true logic state. Like the author’s Volt Checker last month, this Logic Probe is a pocket-sized instrument housed in a small plastic case which is easy to construct and simple to use. The probe is powered from the circuit under test by connecting the power leads to the circuit’s positive and negative power rails. Any supply voltage in the range 3V to 15V can be accommodated, thus allowing the probe to be used on a wide range of TTL and CMOS logic families. The logic\n\nlevel at any node in the circuit is detected simply by touching the probe tip to the appropriate point. A short, detachable, lowimpedance ground lead can be fitted which improves performance when probing high frequency signals.\n\nTwo Colours are Better than One\n\nThe logic state is indicated by a single, bicolour l.e.d. mounted on the p.c.b. at the right height to protrude through a hole in the lid. Basically, we need an l.e.d. capable of indicating one of three states, namely low, high and indeterminate, where the latter state refers to a voltage level lying somewhere in between the acceptable low and high voltage ranges. Note that this cannot be achieved with a single, standard (unicolour) l.e.d. – at least two standard l.e.d.s would be required. The bicolour l.e.d., however, comprising two differently coloured light emitting diode chips encapsulated inside the same housing, provides a way of displaying all three states with a single indicator. Furthermore, as we shall see later, the bicolour l.e.d. also provides a rudimentary indication of the duty cycle of a pulsing signal.\n\nBefore examining the probe’s circuit in detail, we can understand the basic principles by considering the block diagram in Fig.1. The main element is the window comparator – this is the precision analogue section that compares the input voltage at the probe tip with two reference voltages, namely VREF(HIGH) and VREF(LOW). These two references represent the threshold voltages for the high and low logic levels, respectively. The window comparator’s outputs have insufficient current capacity to drive the bicolour l.e.d. directly, so they must be buffered to provide increased current drive. The buffer stage itself is powered by a “low dropout” (LDO) voltage regulator that provides a stable supply voltage for the buffers. This ensures that the l.e.d. has a well-defined intensity that remains constant in spite of any changes in the supply voltage to the logic probe itself. The reference voltages are derived from a potential divider network connected directly across the probe’s supply terminals. This ensures that VREF(HIGH) and VREF(LOW) always “track” the supply voltage of the circuit under test, a requirement which, as we will see shortly, is essential in maintaining a direct relationship between the logic thresholds and the test circuit’s supply voltage. A “logic family” switch connected to the divider network sets the appropriate threshold levels. This switch, mounted on the probe’s lid, is used to configure the unit for the particular family of logic device under test – either TTL or CMOS.\n\nJust in Case\n\nTwo protection mechanisms are included in the probe’s design. The reverse polarity protection diode connected in the positive supply line ensures that all of the “delicate” circuits downstream of the potential "
