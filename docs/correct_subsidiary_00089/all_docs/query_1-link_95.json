We hope you find this newsletter easy to navigate and enjoy the new look and feel.\n\nThe newsletter will continue to share similar information from past issues but we also look forward to adding new features that we hope will enhance the value of the publication. The current and archived issues of the newsletters will be in the Members’ Only Section of the web site.\n\nTo see the full text of longer articles, use the article menu on the website to navigate.\n\nWe would love to hear from you about topics you would like to see addressed in future issues of the newsletter.\n\nPlease contact Cheryl Jamall at [email protected] to submit content and share feedback.\n\nUntil Next Time\n\nScott\n\nNationwide Tournament Raises $60,000 for ABMA Rawson Scholarship\n\nFor the past 35 years, Nationwide Boiler has hosted a Charity Golf Tournament as a way to bring together colleagues, partners and friends and give back to the community. Every year but one, it has been held at the historic Pebble Beach Golf Links and this year was no different. Once again, the tournament benefited the ABMA Randy Rawson Scholarship Fund.\n\nFor golf enthusiast, Pebble Beach is definitely a bucket list experience but anyone coming to Pebble Beach recognizes that unique beauty and breathtaking views of some of the most beautiful countryside. This setting set the table for a first class event in 2015 with representation from ABMA members and staff.\n\nABMA President & CEO Scott Lynch along with Board Members Kevin Hoey, Bob Forslund, Jeff Shallcross, John Viskup, Dustin Divinia and numerous other members participated to support the ABMA Randy Rawson Scholarship Fund. In addition to the ABMA members in attendance, 18 member companies (listed below) sponsored a portion of the event. The sponsorship dollars raised from the ABMA members had a significant impact on the overall dollars raised. We thank everyone for their support.\n\nAESYS Technologies - Alezeta - Babcock & Wilcox - Clark-Reliance - Cleaver-Brooks - National Board - Nationwide Boiler - Nooter/Eriksen - NTFB Combustion - Power Flame Power Mechanical - Powerhouse - Robinson Fans -Strategic Contract Resources - Superior Boiler Works -Vector Systems - Victory Energy - Ware - Webster Engineering\n\nThe event concluded with reception & dinner that included a silent and live auctions and golf awards. ABMA members were very active during the auctions and won numerous items. Thank you goes out to our own Cheryl Jamall, who was able to secure numerous items for the live and silent auction due to her deep and trusted relationships in the hospitality community which raised about $5,000. A special thank you to Rancho Bernardo Inn, Boca Raton Resort, Nemacolin Resort, Coeurd’Alene Resort & Hershey Resorts for submitting items on behalf of ABMA.\n\nOnce all the numbers were tallied, Scott Lynch was presented with a check for $60,000 from tournament host Jeff Shallcross. This is the largest amount ever donated to ABMA.\n\nA tournament like this cannot be successful without a lot of effort in the background. Please join me in thanking the tournament coordinators Chelsey Ryker and Cindy Crumrine along with Michele Tomas. Without their efforts, the scholarship impact would be significantly less.\n\nA final thank you to Jeff Shallcross. Jeff has been longtime advocate for ABMA and instrumental in shifting the tournament proceeds to the ABMA Randy Rawson Scholarship Fund. Jeff is an ABMA Board Member and past recipient of many ABMA recognitions. He continues to be a special leader and focuses much of his attention to advancing our industry.\n\nDon’t forget to share the 2015 scholarship opportunities with your colleagues.

It was Derby Week and the city was alive with anticipation. The race featured arguably the strongest field of horses in decades. The victory by favorite American Pharaoh has once again led to hope that after a nearly forty year drought, we will FINALLY have a Triple Crown winner. Opinions vary but that is why it is horse racing.\n\nPolitics thrive on horse racing analogies, never more so than when Triple Crown season overlaps with the start of a presidential campaign (never mind that this is 2015 and not the year of the actual election). American campaigns grow ever more endless. Many envy the British who just had a five week campaign for Parliament and do not have to go through the ordeal again until 2020. Mainstream media, cable TV, and the Internet love treating presidential campaigns as horse races with daily iterations on who is the favorite, who is coming on strong, who is fading. Never mind that little of this has anything to do with substance. It is just the way we do things in the 24/7 news cycle constantly in need of new stories.\n\nSo they are off. In the last two months, two Democrats (Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders) and six Republicans (Cruz, Paul, Rubio, Carson, Huckabee, and Fiorina) have declared their intentions.\n\nThe Democrats expect three more to join the fray while another seven Republicans could jump in, bringing the total to 18 (just two short of the Kentucky Derby field).\n\nIn the spirit of handicapping, most commentators have been saying that this race remains Clinton’s to lose. This opinion relies upon recent polling data that shows in spite of concerns about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation, the public still has her winning comfortably over every single potential Republican challenger (and with higher favorability rankings).\n\nThis arises from the Electoral College advantage that the Democrats enjoy. Starting with a nearly guaranteed 247 of the 270 needed to win, the Democrats can triumph by carrying Colorado and Virginia (both states where they can take advantage of growing Hispanic populations) and either New Hampshire, Iowa, or Nevada. Forget Ohio and Florida. Part of it also may result from years of Clinton fatigue. We expect them to skirt the edges of legality so when they do it again, we no longer have the strength to care.\n\nAnd the Republican field thus far has had a difficult time gaining traction. There are too many candidates appealing to the narrow base which may be necessary to gain the nomination but too extreme to win the general election (Cruz, Huckabee). Politically inexperienced candidates (Carson, Fiorina) or those that may be still be too green (Rubio, 43 years old, a compelling backstory, articulate, no executive experience). Think about this - if he successfully runs for Governor of Florida in 2018 and then ran for president in 2024, he would still be only 52.\n\nAnd then there is Jeb Bush, he is raising a lot of money, the favorite of Establishment Republicans but is the country really ready to replace the Adams with the Bushes as our longest lasting presidential dynasty?\n\nTo compound Republican difficulties, the Democrats have diligently set up two electoral trick boxes – immigration and gay marriage. Both threaten the Republican’s ability to gain support from elements of the electorate outside of the base that may determine the nomination. Last week, Hillary Clinton double downed on immigration, saying not only would she enforce President Obama’s executive order on deportation, she would expand it. The target clearly is the Hispanic community which holds the ability to determine the winner of the election (see Colorado and Virginia above). Clinton essentially has dared the Republican field to take a stand on the issue. Former Reagan cabinet official William Bennett grudgingly expressed admiration for the strategy, “The immigration waters are treacherous which explains the muted response from Republicans. Not one of the campaigns, with the exception of Jeb Bush, have full clarity on where they want to go and people are doing a lot of moving.”\n\nSame with gay marriage. Recent polls show an amazing shift among voters in favor of gay marriage with nearly 60% of the electorate supporting it, especially among younger voters. To oppose gay marriage allows Democrats to suggest that the Republicans are out of touch and on the wrong side of history. Nuanced opposition runs head first into images of discrimination and bigotry, not a good place to be in 2016.\n\nThe Supreme Court will rule on the issue before the end of its term in late June. Ironically, it may benefit the Republicans’ if the Court endorses gay marriage. Such a ruling could provide the Republicans cover. It would likely mobilize its base while diminish the passion of the Democrats. Conversely, if the Court rejects gay marriage, it will become a more explosive issue in 2016 among Democrats with the attendant mobilization of their base, especially among younger voters.\n\nAnother issue to keep an eye on is Obamacare. The Supreme Court will rule this term on whether the federal government can provide subsidies in states that have not set up independent insurance exchanges. This decision could undermine ACA and potentially introduce millions of new uninsured voters back into the marketplace. If this happens, how both parties react in providing a new solution will have a major impact on who wins in 2016.\n\nSo, the race is on. Right now, Hillary is in the lead and no one else is even close. Bush and Rubio have potential but are just working to avoid losing ground. Keep in mind, we just broke from the gate and there is a long way to go. Hillary going wire to wire is a possibility, but remember when your trainer is named Bill, you never know where you may stumble.\n\nMember News\n\nCleaver-Brooks Receives UL Package Certification for CBEX Boilers 900 to 1,200 HP\n\nTHOMASVILLE, Ga.
