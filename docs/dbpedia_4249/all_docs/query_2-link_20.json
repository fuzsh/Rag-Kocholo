From 1927 to 1930 the political struggle between the Stalinists and these “Rightists” continued, although, unlike the early struggle with the Left, it did not become overt until the Right had been defeated and the new policies had been effectively decided on.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 26, 2024, 6:04 PM ET (AP)\n\nBiden speaks with Modi about Indian premier's recent visit to Ukraine, situation in Bangladesh\n\nAug. 19, 2024, 7:44 AM ET (AP)\n\nCorrection: Vietnam-Russia story\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 9:47 AM ET (AP)\n\nPeter Sellars' staging of Prokofiev’s `The Gambler' is Salzburg Festival's latest offbeat success\n\nAug. 9, 2024, 6:25 AM ET (AP)\n\nVeteran human rights advocate freed in swap says Russia is sliding back toward Stalinist times\n\nAug. 5, 2024, 1:13 PM ET (AP)\n\nAt the Paris Olympics, it will no longer be personal for Ukraine's athletes. This time, it's war\n\nIn the Communist Party reluctant acceptance of NEP as realist and rejection of the Left as adventurist gave way to the increasing conviction that a further struggle was now needed against all antisocialist forces, and especially in the countryside. Though they had accepted the NEP as being necessary to stave off disaster, activists remained devoted to the idea that the party’s duty was to create socialism. And the general mood, though chastened, was of a belief that (as was to become a major slogan) “There are no fortresses that Bolsheviks cannot storm.” In this contest Stalin embodied the attitudes not merely of the people he had brought in through the control of the apparatus but also of the bulk of the old party militants.\n\nMeanwhile the country was dependent on the market’s giving the peasants adequate incentive to sell their grain surplus and feed the cities. The whole feeling of the party was opposed to, suspicious of, and ignorant of the market mechanism. It was also the case that few of the leaders had much economic knowledge and, moreover, the statistics available to them were highly unreliable.\n\nIn 1928 the leadership again thought an unacceptable shortfall in agricultural supplies was imminent. It is now clear that, as in 1923, this was miscalculation; the market could have been balanced by quite a small investment. Instead the Politburo—including the Rightists—voted for supplementing normal trade by a forced requisition. Although it was stated that this was an exceptional measure and that the NEP would continue, it was carried out as a class-war operation. This led to a vicious circle. The peasant, no longer confident in the market, lost the incentive to production that had been the key to the country’s recovery. With less produced for the market, more requisitioning seemed necessary, and this was repeated on a larger scale in the winter of 1929.\n\nThe rationale of the Communist Party’s approach to the problems of the countryside was that the peasantry was divided into classes with different and opposed interests. The rich “kulaks” were implacable enemies of socialism. The “middle peasants,” constituting the great majority, vacillated but could be brought to the proletarian side. And the “poor peasants,” together with the “village proletarians,” were reliable allies.\n\nThere had indeed been a small class of rich peasants, who owned 60 to 80 acres (25 to 35 hectares) of land. These had not been attacked by peasants in the takeover of landlord property but had been liquidated by party detachments in 1918. Through the 1920s the class division in the villages was almost entirely a communist fiction; indeed, this had been shown clearly in the peasant risings of 1918–21. Under the NEP the more enterprising peasants, often former Red Army men, had certainly prospered. But the idea of the existence of a rich exploiting kulak class was false. Moreover, as official documents make clear, the poorer peasants, far from resenting the kulaks, generally regarded them as leaders and depended on them for help in adversity.\n\nAs the economy recovered over the last years of the 1920s, Stalin increasingly argued that a slow socialization was impossible. In 1928 and 1929 he increasingly undermined his former allies of the “Right,” implementing a program of faster industrialization and sharper class struggle with the errant elements of the peasantry.\n\nIt was clear that the party could no longer combine the market and brute force. Either the NEP had to be properly restored or purely confiscatory measures imposed. In 1928 and 1929 Stalin and his supporters gradually went over to the position that only collectivization would make the grain available to the authorities and that to effect this a great sharpening of “class war” in the countryside was required. Bukharin, with Rykov and Tomsky, saw that this would mean a terror regime and destroy the fruits of the NEP. But they were now almost helpless.\n\nThe revival of communist advance from 1928 also resulted in radical changes in the official attitude to the intelligentsia, both technical and creative. It was felt that the new communist specialists in every field were now well enough equipped to take over from their bourgeois predecessors. This was to give much trouble in engineering and also in such spheres as economics and agricultural science.\n\nThis purge was accompanied by the enforcement, more rigidly and more shallowly than previously, of ideological criteria in every sphere of culture, science, and philosophy. In the summer of 1928 the new course was signaled by the public trial in Moscow, amid vast publicity, of 53 engineers on charges of sabotage in the so-called Shakhty Case. The theme, repeated in endless propaganda over the following years, was that bourgeois specialists could not be trusted. Large numbers were subsequently arrested. By 1930 more than half of the surviving engineers had no proper training. In all institutes and academies, ideological hacks were intruded to ensure Marxist, or rather Stalinist, purity of theory and practice.\n\nIn literature the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP), which had a dogmatic “party” approach to writing, took effective control. In 1930 Pilnyak and Zamyatin were removed from their posts as chairmen of the Moscow and Leningrad sections of the Union of Writers, respectively, though Zamyatin was allowed to emigrate.\n\nAt the end of 1929 both bourgeois and communist economists of note who had urged prudence were arrested, and later most of them were shot.\n\nAt the same time the assault on religion was renewed. The Soviet Constitution had guaranteed “freedom of religious and anti-religious propaganda.” On May 22, 1929, this article was amended to “freedom of religious worship and anti-religious propaganda.” This presaged a campaign in which village priests were classified as kulaks, while churches were closed on a large scale and often demolished, over the next few years.\n\nThe Party versus the peasants\n\nFrom mid-1929 decisions on the extent and speed of proposed collectivization were changed almost monthly, becoming ever more extreme. The Five-Year Plan as approved in April–May 1929 envisaged five million peasant households collectivized by 1932–33; this figure was doubled by November and doubled again during December. By the turn of the year it was decreed that collectivization should be completed in Ukraine by the autumn of 1930 and in the other main grain areas by the spring of 1931.\n\nAt the same time, plans for the kulak became harsher. During 1929 many fines were imposed, and dispossessions and even deportations took place. But nothing further than mass expropriation was envisaged, and it was even held that the expropriated kulak might enter the new kolkhozes (collective farms). By the end of the year the official policy became “the liquidation of the kulak as a class.”\n\nThe view of reality that the party maintained was that the mass of the peasantry were now in favour of collectivization, that they were fighting for it against the kulak, and that when it was introduced it would result in a great increase in agricultural production. The realities contradicted all these assumptions. In fact, the collectivization operation was supervised by activists from the cities (the “Twenty-Five Thousanders”) and OGPU men, and it was economically disastrous.\n\nConcurrently with the collectivization itself came the mass arrest and deportation of kulaks. Even the most prosperous section of the peasantry now had average incomes no more than 50 to 60 percent higher than those of the least prosperous, and in any case “dekulakization” was extended by the concept of the “sub-kulak,” which could be applied indiscriminately. Stalin was to speak in 1933 of 15 percent of pre-collectivization peasant households as having been “kulak and better off”; these no longer existed. This would mean about 3.9 million households, or more than 20 million individuals. Of these about a third are estimated to have been “self-dekulakized”—that is, they abandoned their holdings and migrated to the cities—though in theory it became illegal for enterprises to knowingly employ ex-kulaks. Some 10 million, possibly more, were deported to the inhospitable areas of the Arctic and elsewhere, some directly, some after a few months landless in their own localities. The casualty rate was high: though exact totals are hard to deduce, some 2 million or more premature deaths probably occurred.\n\nIn mid-1929 only about 5 million peasants had been on collective farms. On March 1, 1930, this had risen to more than 70 million. Peasant resistance took various forms, including a number of local insurrections, but its main component was the mass slaughter of farm animals to prevent their being taken by the kolkhoz. Official figures given in 1934 showed a loss of 26.6 million head of cattle (42.6 percent of the country’s total) and 63.4 million sheep (65.1 percent of the total), and this is probably an understatement of the facts. On March 2, 1930, faced with this economic disaster, Stalin published his famous article “Dizzy from Success,” attacking “distortions” that had departed from the “voluntary principle” in collectivization and blaming local officials for this error. Over the next months 40 to 50 million peasants left the collectives.\n\nHowever, the kolkhozes now existed, located on the best land in every village and in possession of much of the surviving livestock. Large grain quotas and crippling fines were imposed on the individual peasants, and over the next year the main grain growing areas were essentially re-collectivized.\n\nOne of the most destructive effects of collectivization was in Kazakhstan, where a nomad herding population was forced, largely on ideological grounds, into permanent settlements, for which no economic basis existed. About one-quarter of a million managed to escape over the Chinese border. But, of roughly four million Kazaks, more than a million, and probably some two million, perished.\n\nThe immediate result of these measures was a catastrophic decline in agricultural output across the U.S.S.R. as a whole. The government’s reaction was to base its requirements for delivery of grain from the kolkhozes not on actual production but rather on what became the basis of Soviet agricultural statistics until 1953—the “biological yield.” This was based on the estimated size of the crop in the fields before harvesting; it was more than 40 percent higher than the reality. And in 1932 even this tenuous link to the facts failed: the figure was distorted by merely multiplying acreage by optimum yield. The grain requisitions made on this basis were ruthlessly enforced by activist squads (and, in Bukharin’s view, this experience contributed greatly to the brutalization of the party).\n\nSuch action left the peasant with a notional but nonexistent surplus on which to live. As a result, over the winter of 1932–33, a major famine swept the grain-growing areas. Some 4 to 5 million died in Ukraine, and another 2 to 3 million in the North Caucasus and the Lower Volga area. Both the dekulakization terror of 1930–32 and the terror-famine of 1932–33 were particularly deadly in Ukraine and the Ukrainian-speaking area of the Kuban. They were accompanied by a series of repressive measures against the Ukrainian cultural, political, and social leaderships, the Ukraine’s defender Skrypnik committing suicide in July 1933. During this period about 1.7 million tons (1.5 million metric tons) of grain was exported, enough to have provided some two pounds (one kilogram) a head to 15 million people over three months. There is no doubt that the Stalin leadership knew exactly what was happening and used famine as a means of terror, and revenge, against the peasantry.\n\nA census was taken in January 1937, but it was suppressed, and the Census Board was arrested. Its figures, finally revealed in 1990, showed a population of 162 million. The Soviet demographers had counted on about 177 million. The population deficit, including a decline in births, was thus some 15 million, of which premature death due to deportation and famine are believed to account for at least 10 million."
