        "text": "1914-1918\n\n1914-1918\n\nWorld War I\n\nThe Great War\n\nThe First World War demonstrated the horrors of humanity and technology on a never before seen scale. In the midst of the atrocities, Herbert Hoover, a Stanford alumnus and successful mining engineer, oversaw food relief efforts in Belgium. It was in this capacity that he was inspired to document the history of war and political change. He later reflected on this inspiration, writing, The position I held [as a relief administrator] required regular visits to several belligerent countries. It seemed to me to offer a unique opportunity to collect and preserve such records. I therefore established centers for such collections in each country and enlisted the aid of others who believed in the importance of the work.\n\n(Sources: Freedom Betrayed introduction, by George Nash)\n\n1919\n\n1919\n\nThe Hoover Institution Established\n\nThe Hoover War Collection was established as a library and archives, cementing the Institution’s roots in history and scholarship.\n\nHerbert Hoover conceived the idea for gathering materials on World War I while he was organizing humanitarian relief for Belgium. He began the collection in June 1919, when he was at the Paris Peace Conference advising President Wilson. The founding document of the Hoover Institution is a telegram from Herbert Hoover to Stanford president Ray Lyman Wilbur offering $50,000 for the collecting effort and instructing Wilbur to send Professor Ephraim D. Adams to Paris to begin work.

The founding collections include the extensive files of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, the U.S. Food Administration, and the American Relief Administration in Europe and Russia. Photo Credit: Hoover Institution Archives\n\n1922\n\n1922\n\nThe Hoover War Library\n\nThe Hoover War Collection is renamed the Hoover War Library.\n\nThe Hoover War Library was named on the basis of the collection of primary materials related to World War I. During the course of that year, the library collected forty thousand documents that were housed in the Stanford Library.\n\n1926\n\n1926\n\nHoover Institution Press Established\n\nThe Hoover Institution began publishing its bibliographical series in 1926, beginning with A Catalogue of Paris Peace Conference Delegation Propaganda in the Hoover War Library. This series, which described our library and archival collections, was jointly published with Stanford University Press. The library has since accumulated more than 1.4 million documents.

In this silent clip from the Hoover Archives, Herbert Hoover is shown giving a campaign speech at Stanford Stadium on August 11.

The celebration was brief, however, as the stock market crashed in October of the following year. During his tenure, his popularity sunk to record lows. Over time, history has taken a more objective view, examining his struggles to restore the glory of the 1920s without sacrificing American ideals. Photo Credit: Hoover Institution Archives\n\n1938\n\n1938\n\nA New Name\n\nThe Hoover Library on War, Revolution and Peace\n\nAs the Hoover War Library's collections grew and their scope broadened, the name was changed to the Hoover Library on War, Revolution and Peace.\n\n(Source: Peter Duignan's The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace: Seventy-Five Years of its History, 1989 (page 17)\n\n1938\n\nA New Home\n\nThe plans for Hoover Tower are announced\n\nSince the mid-1920s, Hoover and Stanford had been planning to move the Library into its own building. The Great Depression, however, made fund-raising nearly impossible; it was not until 1938 that Stanford decided $600,000 was sufficient for the building. The design, as seen here, was contracted to Arthur Brown Jr., who also designed Stanford's University Library, San Francisco City Hall, and San Francisco's Coit Tower.

Ours is a system where the Federal Government should undertake no governmental, social or economic action, except where local government, or the people, cannot undertake it for themselves. . . . The overall mission of this Institution is, from its records, to recall the voice of experience against the making of war, and by the study of these records and their publication, to recall man's endeavors to make and preserve peace, and to sustain for America the safeguards of the American way of life. This Institution is not, and must not be, a mere library. But with these purposes as its goal, the Institution itself must constantly and dynamically point the road to peace, to personal freedom, and to the safeguards of the American system.\" Photo Credit: Peninsula-Times Tribune photographs of Stanford University (PC0065).

The Hoover Institution provided an overview of the findings at these sessions and hosted a public panel discussion \"Revisiting the 2008 Financial Crisis: the Causes, the Panic, the Recession and the Lessons.\"\n\n2019\n\n2019\n\nHoover Centennial\n\nHoover Institution Centennial\n\nOn April 22, 2019 the Hoover Institution celebrates 100 years.\n\n2019\n\nHoover Institution Marks Its Centennial\n\nThe Hoover Institution celebrated 100 years with a lecture series examining policy issues that defined America over the past century.

Atlas and Edward Paul Lazear, aimed at providing scholarly analysis on the arguments and outcomes produced by the world’s dominant, conflicting, and most fiercely debated economic systems: Socialism and Free-Market Capitalism. The project covers a broad range of issues, from historical perspectives and examination of current policies, such as each system’s influence on national economic growth, as well as important social imperatives including broad access to ensuring quality medical care, enacting sensible immigration policies, protecting the environment, and forging strategic international relationships. Since its creation, fellows participating in the Human Prosperity Project produced essays, participated in panel discussions, and were featured on Hoover’s educational video platform PolicyEd.

Throughout his five-decade-long career, Hanushek's research has largely focused on the premise that K–12 education will not progress unless policy decisions are based on rigorous evaluations of student performance. Notably, he has concluded that solely increasing government expenditures to education does not directly correlate with greater student achievement.
