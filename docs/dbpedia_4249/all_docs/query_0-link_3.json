        "text": "Much is known about Soviet cultural life under Stalin. It has been described in a large memoir literature which, whether published in the Soviet Union or the West, basically expresses the viewpoint of the old Russian intelligentsia and tends to be a literature of moral protest, either against the Soviet regime as such or against the abuses of the Stalin period. There is an equally impressive body of Western scholarly literature analyzing the syndrome of “totalitarian control” of culture, with its characteristics of arbitrary repression, destruction of traditional associations, enforced conformity, censorship, political controls, and injunctions to writers and artists to act as “engineers of the human soul” in the Communist transformation of society. The concept of totalitarianism—developed in the postwar years, which were also the formative years of American Soviet studies—incorporated its own element of moral condemnation, making the scholarly literature strikingly similar in tone to the memoir literature of the intelligentsia.\n\n10. For the first resolution of the Central Committee, “On the elementary and middle school, ” September 5, 1931, see KPSS v resoliutsiiakh i resheniiakh s “ezdov, konferentsii i plemimov TsK, vol. 4 (Moscow, 1970), p. 569 ff. (in this edition, the date of the resolution is wrongly given as August 25, 1931). For subsequent resolutions of the Central Committee—” On teaching programs and regimes in the elementary and middle school” (August 25, 1932), “On textbooks for the elementary and middle school” (February 12, 1933), “On the structure of the elementary and middle school in the USSR” (May 1934), “On publication and sale of textbooks for the elementary, incomplete middle, and middle school” (August 7, 1935), and “On the organization of teaching work and internal discipline in the elementary, incomplete middle, and middle school” (September 3, 1935)—see Direktivy VKP(b) i postanovleniia sovetskogo pravitel'stva o narodnom obracovanii, vol. 1 (Moscow-Leningrad, 1947), p. 159 ff.\n\n30. Between July 1937 and December 1938, Gorky was the subject of 333 scholarly articles listed under literaturovcdenie in the Letopis', or 15 percent of the total. Pushkin, with 220 articles, was in second place. Four articles were published on Marx, Engels, or Marxist literary criticism; 18 on Lenin; 7 on Stalin. The Stalin articles and many of the Lenin ones were on the image of Stalin (Lenin) in folklore, the other Lenin articles being of the “Lenin on Gorky, ” “Lenin on Belinsky” type. (The first half of 1937 has been omitted from the calculation above because of distortion attributable to the Pushkin centenary: of 840 articles published January-June 1937 on literature, 429 were on Push kin, 68 on Gorky, 2 on Marx and Engels, 4 each on Lenin and Stalin.) In the category of khtidoshestvennaia literatura (poems, plays, novels, short stories) published in the journals 1937-38, Stalin was the subject of 121 works (mainly poems by Central Asian and other non-Russian writers and folk balladists), Pushkin the subject of 65 works, Lenin of 62, and Gorky of 8. An analysis for comparative purposes of the Lctopis’ for 1948 (minus two of the weekly issues) shows Gorky still in first place as the subject of 45 articles, or 9 percent of the total, as against 8 on Pushkin, 1 on Marx-Engels, 3 on Lenin, and none on Stalin. In the khudoshcstvcnnaia literatura category for that year, Stalin was the subject of 25 works, Lenin of 10, Gorky of 4, Pushkin of 4, and Marx-Engels of 2."
