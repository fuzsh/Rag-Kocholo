        "text": "Washington, D.C., September 28, 2020 – The National Security Archive mourns the death of our friend and inspiration, the human rights legend and distinguished physicist Yuri Orlov. Founder of the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1976, Yuri Fedorovich passed away on September 27 at the age of 96.\n\nThe Archive’s tribute to Yuri Orlov, published on the Web today, features an extensive collection of formerly secret Soviet and U.S. documents on Orlov’s courageous career as a Soviet dissident, including his historic 1956 speech at his physics institute in Moscow, the text of his legendary “Thirteen Questions to Brezhnev” where he proposed “glasnost” almost 15 years before Gorbachev, and KGB reports on his leadership of the Moscow Helsinki Group.\n\nThe posting also includes Orlov's complete publications list as an active research physicist, his 2009 Vernon Hughes Memorial Lecture at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and video of Orlov's White House meeting with President Ronald Reagan in 1986.\n\nThe documents include detailed KGB, Communist Party Central Committee and Politburo documents, together with parallel CIA and White House assessments, that suggest how courageous human rights activism by leading Soviet scientists like Orlov as early as 1956 fundamentally threatened the repressive Soviet system while setting the stage for the late 1980s perestroika/glasnost period that ended the Cold War.\n\nYuri Orlov and Ronald Reagan (with interpreter) in the Oval Office, October 7, 1986. Credit: Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nThe documents show that through organizing the Moscow Helsinki Group (with Lyudmila Alexeyeva) in May 1976, Orlov institutionalized human rights monitoring based on the principles in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, signed by the USSR and even published in Pravda. Multiple other Helsinki groups soon followed throughout Eastern and Western Europe, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, contributing enormous intellectual capital to the international human rights movement and to social processes that culminated in the peaceful revolutions of 1989. The Moscow Helsinki Group remains the oldest still-functioning human rights organization in Russia, and Orlov subsequently became honorary chairman of the International Helsinki Federation.\n\nOrlov survived multiple repressions by the authorities: fired from his Moscow physics institute and denounced in Pravda for his 1956 speech, he was effectively banned from working in the main institutes and had to pursue his scientific career in distant centers such as Yerevan and Novosibirsk, where sympathetic physicists supported him. In 1972 Orlov came back to Moscow at the Terrestrial Magnetism Institute but soon lost his job there for the multiple sins of co-founding the first Soviet chapter of Amnesty International and speaking out against the persecution of fellow physicist Andrei Sakharov.\n\nThe Archive’s tribute today includes Orlov’s famous letter to the General Secretary of the CC CPSU, Leonid Brezhnev, “On the causes of intellectual backwardness of the USSR and proposals to overcome it,” also known as “Thirteen Questions to Brezhnev,” which he wrote in September 1973. In this letter Orlov points to the isolation of Soviet scientists from their Western colleagues and suppression of free speech and information as causes of intellectual backwardness even when the Soviet Union has “wonderful researchers and wonderful results.” In the letter, the dissident physicist demands reforms that would build democracy on the basis of socialism, which would include dismantling of the repressive apparatus and official “scientific” ideology, introducing elements of capitalist economy, and allowing free travel abroad and exchange of ideas. He calls the Soviet system under Stalin “slavery without private property.” In the four pages of the letter, Orlov criticizes Marxism as a theoretical construct and lays out his vision of a comprehensive reform of the Soviet system starting with, “as the first step—abolition of censorship of the press, free exchange of information, glasnost.”\n\nOrlov’s open letter “Thirteen Questions to Brezhnev” (original and translation)\n\nArrested by the KGB in February 1977 for his Helsinki Group initiative, Orlov suffered through KGB prisons, a three-day farce trial in 1978, years in hard labor camps at Perm-35 and -37, and internal exile in Siberia, before being deported from the Soviet Union in 1986. According to Anatoly Chernyaev's notes of the Soviet Politburo session of September 22, 1986, President Reagan had only agreed to have a summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at Reykjavik, Iceland (it would take place in October), on the conditions that the Soviets release imprisoned American journalist Nicholas Daniloff (he was traded for Soviet spy Gennadi Zakharov, jailed in New York), and \"if there was a positive response\" to American demands for action on a list of 25 Soviet dissidents imprisoned or in internal exile. Of that list, Chernyaev's notes show Gorbachev ordered the release of only Orlov, saying \"we should not agree to more than Daniloff and Orlov in one month. The people will not understand us. We also have our limits.\"\n\nOrlov and Reagan face the media in the White House Cabinet Room, October 7, 1986.

According to Orlov's account in his memoirs, Dangerous Thoughts: Memoirs of a Russian Life (New York: William Morrow and Company, 1991), Reagan told him that the U.S. had asked for the Soviets to release Andrei Sakharov and let him immigrate to Boston, but the Soviets had said impossible because Sakharov knew too many nuclear weapons secrets. Orlov advised Reagan not to ask for Sakharov's emigration but only for his release, to stay in the Soviet Union but freely. For the next several months (and years), Orlov traveled and spoke throughout Europe and the U.S. to bring attention to the remaining dissidents in the USSR, who were subsequently released \"like drops of blood squeezed from a stone.\"\n\nOrlov went on to serve as a Visiting Fellow in 1988 at CERN, the European nuclear research center, and as Senior Scientist starting in 1987 in the Nuclear Studies Laboratory at Cornell University, where he became Professor of Physics and Government in 2008. While his early physics research in the USSR had focused on the design of particle accelerators, including a proton synchrotron at his institute (the Heat Engineering Laboratory, subsequently ITEP) in Moscow and the electron synchrotron at the Yerevan Physics Institute in Armenia, Orlov's work at CERN and in the U.S. focused on elementary particle spin physics and measurement of subatomic particles, as well as the foundations of quantum mechanics.\n\nYuri Orlov meeting White House chief of staff Donald Regan, introduction by President Reagan, October 7, 1986. Credit: Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nThe Brookhaven National Laboratory's famous Muon (g-minus-2) Collaboration (now at Fermilab) recruited Orlov in 1987 based on his early publications from Yerevan about particles in magnetic fields (g-2 rings), and he later became a founding member of Brookhaven's Electric Dipole Moment Collaboration. These collaborations have produced experimental results that suggest \"new physics beyond the Standard Model,\" according to Orlov's friend and colleague Vernon Hughes, to whom Orlov paid tribute in an eloquent 2009 memorial lecture. As a Brookhaven statement from 2002 explains, \"The g-2 value measures the effects of three of the four forces known to exist in the universe — the strong force, the electromagnetic force, and the weak force (but not the fourth force, gravity) — on a characteristic of these particles known as 'spin,' which is somewhat similar to the spin of a toy top.\" For more details on Orlov's physics career, see the Cornell Physics Department web page.\n\nOrlov received his first visa to return to the USSR in June 1989 in the middle of Gorbachev's glasnost and nationally televised sessions of the newly elected Congress of Peoples' Deputies — including Andrei Sakharov. Orlov's remarkable visit, recounted in the memoir Dangerous Thoughts, included reunions with his children and human rights activists, and even a speech on the platform of the Luzhniki sports complex where the nascent \"Memorial\" association held massive public meetings chaired by \"my physicist friend\" Lev Ponomaryov, who had helped keep Orlov alive in exile.\n\nSidney and Yuri Orlov with Archive director Tom Blanton at the 30th anniversary celebration of the Moscow Helsinki Group, 2006.

Orlov's continued engagement with the international human rights struggle was dramatically highlighted at the 30th anniversary celebration in 2006 of the founding of the Moscow Helsinki Group.\n\nThe authors of this posting express our warmest thanks and deepest condolences to Sidney Orlov, who worked so closely with us and with her late husband to memorialize the Moscow Helsinki Group and Yuri Orlov's extraordinary career.\n\nTHE DOCUMENTS"
