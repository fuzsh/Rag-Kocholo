High- lights of the discussions follow; President's Address Academician S. I. Vavilov, President of the Academy of Sciences, who made the opening address, stated that the mayor business was a review of the 1950 work plans. According to Vavilov, these plans were drawn up by the individual institutes of the acade?ly and its affiliates, reviewed by the bureaus of the various departments, and then submitted for approval to the Presidium. After much work on the part of the Scientific Council of the academy and certain sections of the Presidium, the 1950 work plan was submitted for apps-,va1 to ministries, other governmental agencies, and then edited fpr publisi;ing. All of the academicians and corresponding members of the Acade~i of Sciences had a hand in the original draft,of this 1950 plan, ,and for that purpose it is fitting that the final draft be presented at a General Assembly of the Academy of Sciences. Various parts of the 1950 plan will be presented at this general assembly by Academician A. V. Topchiyev, Academician Ye. A. Chudakov, and Academician I. P. Bardin, for Academician V. P. Volgitt, who is out of Moscow temporarily. Vavilov further stated that the past year has been a notable one; programs aimed at a rapid completion of the postwar Five-Year Plan have received an important stimulus; and great strides have been made in industry and agriculture. The inter- national stature of the Soviet Union has also increased. Today, hand in hand 'with the nations of the people's democracies, the Soviet Union is resA.hing for new goals. Much historical significance will be attached to the successes of the People's Democracy in China. The working peoples of the world are more and more uniting their efforts toward a peaceful world. Under these conditions, science and knowledge have advanced more than at any other time. Science is growing both in qualit and in quantity. Moreover, the party, the state and all nationals ~f-.the USSR~are making greater demands on science. There is no hesitation about saying that the achievements in science have permitted the rapid advance of Soviet countries to a state of ideal Communism. For that reason the work plan of the Acadeigy of Sciences ie. constant],y widening its limits. The final draft of the academy's work plan covers 150 printed pages. -1- SECRE`~ CLASSIFICATION SECRET STATE X NAW NSRB - DISTRIDUTlON ARMY AIR F61 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3 According to Vavilov, in 1949, the academy strove for greater cooperation be- tween scientific factions and industrial technology and requirements. This aspect of the academy's work is reflected in that section of the 1950 plan which calls for a greatly intensified program for the introduction of completed scientific projects into industrial practice. In its work plans, the aim of the Academy of Sciences is to free itself from those faulty conceptions, the nature of which we will not discuss at this time, but which in previous years have been wide]y dis- seminated within scientific circles to the detriment of Soviet sciettce in general. Moreover, projects purely of an incidental nature, which have no itmnediate prac- tical or theoretical value, will not be supported by the academy. Vavilov stressed the fact that 1950 is the final year for the postwar Five- Year Plan. The Academy of Sciences also has its five-year plan which was. used as a basis for drawing up the 1950 work plan. At this meeting the aims of the Academy of Sciences in the field of scienti__?ic development as well as in matters pertain- ing to the training of young scientists will be discussed. Vavilov revealed that the publishing activities of the Academy of Sciences are constantly Browning, and today the academy has become the largest publisher in the USSR. The state, therefore, expects the academy publishers to present material whose quality will be unexcelled. In addition to articles-and other pub- lications of a highly technical nature, the Academy of Sciences also publishes numerous articles on a popular-science level. Vavilov warned that another important function of the academy, which is grow- ing in importance, is the?part it plays in coordinating the scientific endeavor of the Soviet Union through its many meetings, bulletins, etc.. President Vavilov concluded by stating that Soviet science has been assigned an important duty by Stalin, and it will be up to Soviet scientists in general and members of the Academy of Sciences in particular to achieve that goal at the end of the first postwar Five-Year Plan. Morning Session The meeting was called to order by President S. I. Vavilov, who stated that the delegates were assembled primarily to hear and approve the 1950 work plans of the Academy of Sciences. Academician A. V. Topchiyev followed with his speech \"Plan for Scientific Re- search Wyk of the n~aAo,.,.. ..r ~,.: _____ ..,...., _ __ --- -- uaueIDll 1V$l1K SS.S'it, 1V0 '2, 1950 The next speech was given by Academician Ye. A. Chudakov, member of the Presi- dium, Academy of Sciences USSR, ~n the \"Plan of the Academy of Sciences USSR on the Introduction of Completed Scientific-Research Projects Into Industrial Practice.\" (Appended) Various members of the General Assembly then submitted their comments and views on the above-mentioned reports. Academician I. G. Petrovskiy, Academician Secretary of the Department of Physicomathematical Sciences, reported that the institutes of his department were all completing their 1949 plans as per schedule. In the Physics Institute, re- search is being concluded on optical phenomena in a media that is simul-taneousl,}. luminescent and absorbent. At the Leningrad Physicotechnical Institute, new methods have been devised (ultracentrifuge) which permit studies of the properties of synthetic proteins. Members of the Institute of Crystallography are completing research, conducted for a number of years, on the structure of tourmaline attd have achieved great success with respect to the adoption by industry of synthetic corun- dum. The Geophysics Institute has continued operating several large expeditions - 2 - SECRET SEC~E?~ Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3 (Ashkhabad, Garm, Northern Tien Shan). At the Mathematics Institute, new and in- teresting results have been achieved in the field of the theory of numbers, topo- logy, and the theory of probability. At the Central Astronomical Observatory, work was completed on the installation of the first Soviet meniscus photoheliograph at the Vysokogornaya Stante?iya (Righ Mountain Station) and continuous photography of the sun has been initiated. At the Crimean Astrophysics Observatory, some im- portant data was obtained on the spectra of carbon stars. Anew type of electron- optic apparatus was developed which permitted studies of the structure of the galactic centers. Some valuable information was wrought back by the Sikhote-Alin Meteorite Expedition. In his presentation of t: . 1950 plan, Petrovskiy discussed those projects which had not been included in the 1949 plans. In the field of mathematics, the 1950 plan called for solution of important theorectical problems on topology and the theory of numbers, the mathematics of elementary particles as applied to problems of the theoretically probable systems of physical processes, and quasi-conformal repre- sentations necessary for those conducting research in the field of mechanics. According to Petrovskiy, the physics institu.es of the department, in addition :o solving various basic problems in their fields (theory of the structure of the atom, studies of the nature and composition of cosmic rays, luminescence and semi- conductors), will also strive to achieve a 100y6 complete record with respect to the introduction into industrial practice of proje,=ts previously completed. Among them are daylight lamp bulbs, piezoelectric elements from barium titans+,e, the use of \"elegaz\" as an insulating material in high-tension cables, a new type of photoresist- ance fog use in the film industry, and a method for direct production of thin sheets of aluminum from melts, etc. The Institute of Crystallography hae developed a new light, yet strong, material for use in industry. The Geophysics Institute, he said, is studying zhe nature of the hard envelope of the earth for a key to a solution of the problem of forecasting earthquakes. A new project has been undertaken by this institute in its 1950 plan; it will study the physics of clouds and precipitation. In the field of astronomy, special pro- visions have been made for the reconstruction of the Central Astronomical Observa- tory at Pulkovo and the Crimean Astrophysics Observatory. The plan for this department, Petrovskiy added, also has provisions for the solution of methodological problems and problems on the history of science and re- search as they relate to the reconstruction of Moscow. Academician V. S. Nemchinov, acting chairman of the Council for the Study of the Productive Forces of the USSR, Academy of Sciences USSR, stated that in deter- mining the 1950 work plan for the council, great care was taken to have the elements of the plan comply with the provisions of the 30 ~ + 1949 resolution of the Presi- dium, Academy of Sciences USSR. He stressed the fact that the general level of the work of the council depends on the scientists and technicians who are assigned to any one problem. Nemchinov discussed those provisions of the 1950 plan which were instituted as a result of the requirements and resolutions of Gosplan SSSR, and the Presi- dium, Academy of Sciences USSR. One of the first projects will be a review of the studies conducted to determine the role of the Pechora, Karaganda, Kuznetz, and Ural coking and other types of coal in the economy of the Urals. .The council has also scheduled work leading to a technical and economic evaluation of the Ayat de- posits and a determination of their contribution to the economic status of the Urals. In November 1950, the council will convene a special meeting to discuss problems pertaining to the Urals and will also expand its work on the Far East and in Kazakhstan. There also appears to be a need for~some complex ~.e., partici- pated in by all concerned partie~ meetings on individual problems on the develop- ment of the productive pbwer of the USSR, for example a conference on cement, clays, etc. Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3 f ~ c?~~~~~ ,~ Nemchinov also indlcated. that 1950 would be a banner year fns the council, not only with respect to its compliance with resolutions of the Presidium, Acad- emy of Sciences USSR, but also in view oi' the fact that five out of seven complex expeditions will conclude operations by mid-1950. Academician A. A. Mikulin, discussing problems relative to the introduction of completed projects into industrial practive gratefully acknowledged the contri- butions afforded by the Stalin regime. He stated that the slow tempo for the in- trodr:tion of completed projects is not dve to a lack of liaison between scietttific institutes of the academy and the ministries, but rather due to a lack of liaison between individuals in institutes of the academy and the ministries. In line with this, Academician Mikulin recommended the organization of a special bureau within the Presidium, Academy of Sciences USSR, which would be responsible for contacting the proper authorities to provide for the introduction of completed projects into industrial practice. Academician D. S. Belyankin, Academician Secretary of the Department of Geo- logical and Geographical Sciences, stated that in his estimation the 1950 plan pro- vided for elimination of multiplicity of research subjects and tended toward greater consolidation of the various research projects. The plan for the Insti- tute of Geological Sciences (the major institute of the department) included re- search on iron, nonferrous metals (location of their deposits and their utiliza- tion), coal, petroleum, rare elements, etc. The Soils Institute, which for a long time has been suffering as a result of some undesirable conditions, in ac- cordance with resolutions of the Presidium has finally improved its performance. In 1950, 'his institute wiles study problems in the transformation of nature and the planting of shelter bets. Most of the other institutes of the department will continue the work they had been carrying out in 1949. Academician Belyankin discussed briefly the achievements of the Department of Geological and Geographical Sciences in 1949. The program of the Institute of Geological Sciences was completely revamped in that year, and greater emphasis was placed or, the state requirement for expansion of the mineral and raw material bases. In line with this revamping of the work program, the institute organized several large expeditions: into the northern Urals, central and eastern Siberia, the region of the Russian plain, etc. Some of the data already obtained may lead to the mining of a lead ore in certain parts of central Asia. New data has also been obtained on the mineralology and petrogrsphy of the Kola Peninsula. The Laboratory of the Physicomechanical Properties of Rocks, according to Bel- yankin has determined the possibility of utilizing Moscow limestone of the Lower Carboniferous strata as a facing stone for high Moscow buildings. .Haring the field-work season, he stated, the Geography Inetitute sent out a total of five expeditions, which had as their purpose geographical and geomor- phological studies relevant to the state shelter-belt planting program and the plan for expanding tea cultivation. Of the many projects assigned the Soils Institute, Academician Belyankin mentioned only the project \"Studies of the Baradinsk Depression for Purposes of Melioration.\" The work will include cartography as'well as a certain amount of laboratory research. The Institute of Permafrost Studies has completed a project which has resulted in the laying of gas pipelines at a depth less than that here- tofore accepted. The Oceanological Institute is compiling a report based on data obtained by a complex oceanological expedition; this report may lead to a descrip- tiott of colonies of marine life at great depths. The Laboratory of ~Ydrogeological Problems imeni F. P. Savarenskiy discussed mineral springs and submitted a pro- gram for intensified surveying for new mineral springs. -4- SECRET Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3 SECRET In his report, Academician G. F. Aleksandrov, Director of the Institute of Philosophy, stated that the 1950 plan calls for iatensified development of the theory of Soviet socialism, Academician H. A. Vvedenskiy, Academician Secretary of the Department of Tech- nical Sciences, gave an analysis of the findings of ministries and other scientific institutes which examined the 1950 work plan of his department. Academician Ye. N, Pavlovskiy, Director of the Zoological Institute, in his report stressed the need for rapid adoption of new research methods. Pavlovskiy appealed to the Presidium, Academy of Sciences, to take the necessary steps to provide sufficient financial aid for the various expeditions which the institute has scheduled. This is particularly important, he urged, in the case of expeditions which are of a strictly seasonal nature and whose success depends on prompt dis- patch. Academician A. Ye. Arbuzov deplored the fact that many of the scientists are not familiar with industrial technology, thus creating a situation where completed scientific projects are not suited for rapid adoption by industry. Arbuzov suggests the organization of a special group charged with the duty of maintaining close liai- son between scientist and industrialist. As its last act for the morning, the General Assembly approved the preliminary draft for scientific research work of the academy, the plan for the training of sci- entific personnel, and the plan for the introduction of completed projects into ' industrial practice. The morning session was adjourned by Academician S. I. Va- vilov who stated that L-he ly5v yian still had some elements which need clarification. Evening Session The highlight of the evening session was a discussion of the 1950 plan for pub- lishing work to be done by the Academy of Sciences USSR. Academician I. P. Bardin, Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences USSR, submitted the report on the proposed plan for Academician V. P. Volgin, Deputy Chairman of the Editorial-Publishing Council, Academy of Sciences USSR.. The report stated that in 1950 the publishing activities would be increased commensurate to the general increase of scientific research now taking place in the institutes of the Academy of Sciences. The 1950 plan calls for the printing of 15,350 manuscript pages, of which the greatest number are in the field of social sciences. Of the 15,350 manuscript pages, 11,641 pages will be printed into books representing 635 titles. The Department of Bio- logical Sciences submitted 1,859 manuscript pages, while the Department of Techni_al Sciences and the Department of Geological and Geographical Sciences each submitted approximately 700 manuscript pages. The Department of Chemical Sciences is credited with 500 manuscript pages while the Department of Pbysicomathematical Sciences has submitted 562 manuscript pages. The Commission of Popular-Science Literature has submitted 867 manuscript pages for publication. Bardin reported that severs? multivolume sets are also scheduled for publica- tion according to the 1950 work plan. There are provisions for the publishing of Volumes II and III of a ten-volume set on M. V. Lomonosov's works, as well as the first six volumes of a 2~-volume set on I. P. Pavlov's works. In addition, multi- volume sets will be published on the works of V. V. Dokuchayev, A. N. Krylov, V. L. Komarov, P. L. Chebyshev, L. I. N.andel'shtam, T. D. Lysen'~o, N. G. Chebotarev, A. A. Baykov and others. Preparations will also be made for the publication in the near future, of volumes on the works of I. M. Gubkin, D. N. Pryanishnikov, P. N. Yablochko, and others. Atwo-volume set of the complete works of Darwin is scheduled for com- pletion in 1950. Among the more important works to be published in 1950, according to Bardin, are: Research on the Problems of the Microstructure of Li ht, containing work by Academician S. I. Vavilov, History of Rocks Volume I by A. Ye. Fersman; -5- SECRET SECRE?~ .

Zavaritskiy, Trematoda in Man and Animals by K. I. Skryabin, and selected works of Academicians A. N. Bakh, P. P. Shor},~- gin, and S. N Bernshteyn.In all, there will be a total of 50 titles by famous Soviet scientists. Bardin stated that there are some serious defects in the operations of the publishing functions of the Acadetgy of Sciences which need immediate attention. For example, he said, there have been numerous cases of an excessive time lag be- tween the submission of manuscripts and their actual publication. In addition, there have been several cases where books have been published without sufficient editing with the result that there are numerous errors. Many of these errors are typographical but, more serious, many of the errors are of an ideological nature. This report was discussed by Academicians S. I. Vol'fkovich, Ye. N. Pavlov- skiy, V. V. Shuleykin, Corresponding Members of the Academy of Sciences A. M. Yegolin, K. A. Pazhitnov, A. M. Pankratova, K. V. Ostrovityanov, A. D. Udal'tsiv, and A. I. Nazarov, Director of the Publishers, Acadetgy of Sciences USSR. The commentators were unanimous in their opinion that the work of the publish- ing activity of the Academy of Sciences had improved greatly over the past year. A. I. Nazarov stated that the aid rendered by the state to the Publishers, Acad- emy of Sciences USSR, was instrumental in placing the publishing activity of the academy in the position of the foremost publishers of scientific literature in the Soviet Union. Some comment was also made regarding the relatively low circulation and high prices of scientific books, particularly of popular-science literature, since the purpose of popular-science literature can be accomplished only by the widest pos- sible circulation at the lowest possible cost. President Vavilov stated that this undesirable aspect of popular-science literature would be eliminated in 1950 by the initiation of new polygraphical technology, such as photography, which will permit the publishing of greater numbers of issues without appreciable increase of publishing cost, thus event~?ally leading to a decrease in the cost per issue of the publications. Vavilov also stated that one of the best methods for assuring the quality of manuscripts would be to mske each individual author fully respon- sible for the scientific and ideological quality of his work. The General Assembly approved the 1950 plan for the publication of 15,300 manu- script pages. PLAN OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES USSR ON THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPLETED SCIENTIFIC-RESEARCH PROJECTS INTO INDUSTRIAI, PRACTICE The following report .aas submitted by Academician Ye. A. Chudakov. Two statements by Stalin are the basis for the great achievements realized by Soviet science. These are: \"Not only to attain but to surpass the level of science in foreign countries\" and \"Soviet science does not hold itself aloof from the demands of the, people. It is a science ever aware of the needs of the people.\" As a result, the Academy of Sciences USSR undertakes the study and solution of various important problems, and also provides for their rapid adoption by industry to serve the people as efficiently as possible. It should be the aim of every scientist working at the Academy of Sciences to see that the results of his scientific endeavor can be rapidly adopted by in- dustry. Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3 Up to now, this aspect of the academy's work has been rather poorly emphasized; therefore, the 1950 plan calla for a system which will ensure rapid adoption of com- pleted projects. Naturally, it is difficult to determine at any one time the parti- cular state of completion of any project. For that purpose, the Presidium has de- veloped a classification system which will permit better evaluation of the stage of completeness of projects prior to their introduction into industry: 1. In process of adoption. 2. In process of preparation prior to adoption in industry. 3. In process of testing or undergoing factory testing. 4. In preparation for testing or for factory testing. 5. In state of cooperative development with industrial and scientific agencies. 6. In preparation for cooperative development. 7. Notice of intention, by publication, to adopt into industry. This system will permit greater control over the stage of completion of any project and should do much toward speeding up the program of adoption of completed scientific projects. The departments of the Academy of Sciences got together and organized a Com- mission for the Preparation and Editing of the 1950 Plan, prior to the submission of the \"Plan for the Introduction Into Industrial Practice of Completed Projects\" to the Presidium, Acadetgy of Sciences USSR. Academician I. I. Artobolevskiy (chair- man), Academician S. I. Vol'fkovich, Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sci- ences B. M. Vul, Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences USSR A. L. Kursanov, and several others were appointed to this commission. One of the first duties of the commission was to review plans for the \"intro- duction into industrial practice\" of projects of the various departments. Careful examination on the part of the commission prevented many serious errors. The final first draft listed 545 projects which were ready to be introduced into industrial practice. Of the above number, 360 had to do with new technology, rationalization of industrial processes, and other matters bearing on the nation's economy. One hundred and eighty-five works are scheduled for possible \"adoption\" by industry or will be published to inform industry oP their existence and their possible later \"adoption.\" In this latter category, 103 projects belong to the social science departments. At present, 5 6 projects are ready for adoption; of this number, Gostekhnika (State Committee for the Introduction of Advanced Techniques Into the National Economy) SSSR has urged immediate adoption of 48 projects. At this time, it is' impossible to list all of the projects which are to be adopted; however, it is possible to give a general idea of the projects. For example, the Department of Physicomathematical Sciences has perfected new highly stable anisotropic and insulating materials, luminophors for luminescent tubes, barium titanites, tech- nical and engineering fundamentals for the construction of stations in earthquake zones, and new industrial technology. In this latter category, there is the de- velopment by the Mathematics Institute imeni V. A. Steklov of a method for laying out patterns for steel bars and steel plates which will result in great savings of steel.

Department of Geological and Geographical Sciences will submit for general adoption new methods for surveying and discovering of petroleum, coal, bauxite, iron, nonferrous metals, and rare element deposits, as well as innovations in the field of construction and refractory materials. Some of the work accomplished by the Council for the Study of Productive Forces of the USSR and the Soils Institute will permit expansion of agriculture in Kalin- ingrad Oblast, cotton growing in the Transcauca and Central Asia, as well as im- provement of the water regime and general utilization of the Baradinsk depression in Siberia. A considerable contribution to the national economy was credited to the Institute of Permafrost Studies which suggested the laying of bas conduits in perma- frost ground at a depth much less than heretofore recommended. The Laboratory on Hydrogeological Problems completed some useful projects relating to mineral and artesian waters and the Oceanological Institute has available several completed projects which should aid Soviet fisheries. The Department of Technical Sciences is credited with projects: on thermal technology (binary boilers, flameless combustion, and power-chemical utilization of fuels), in the field of metallurgy (electrosmelting of titanium-magnesium ores), in the field of machine building (new method for conducting computations on ma- chine parts and determination of their wear characteristics), automatization of projective processes (automatization of drilling operations), and general matters of regulation with respect to the intensification of mining processes, as well as new methods for dressing ores (flotation, etc.). Agencies of the department have also completed new types of computers. The Department of Biological Sciences has several projects which are intended to increase harvest yields, improve animal husbandry, as well as improve the pro- duction of tea, vitamins, antibiotics, caoutchouc-bearing plants, and subtropical plants. As stated previously, the Acadetgy of Sciences has for the first time established a separate plan for the introduction of completed projects into industrial practice. The goals established by the plan are very high, but a review of the 1950 plan re- vealed certain important shortcomings. One of t.ie greatest weaknesses of the plan is its lack of complete agreement between the scientific activities of the Academy of Sciences and corresponding institutes in ministries and industries, particularly with respect to the adoption of completed scientific projects by industrial agencies. Some of the institutes (outside of +.he Academy of Sciences) are working more or less independently of the requirements of party and state. Moreover, frequently there is not sufficient technical-economical control .over projects which are scheduled for adoption by industry. All of these shortcomings are to be eliminated before the approval of the final draft of .the 1950 plan for the introduction of completed projects into industrial practice. ~~~~~~~~ Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/22 :CIA-RDP80-00809A000600360891-3"
