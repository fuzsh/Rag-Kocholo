        "text": "The Federal Research Center “Kazan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences” is the successor of the Kazan Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences\n\nDuring the World War II, the Institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences were evacuated to Kazan, the capital of the Tatar ASSR. Moscow and Kazan scientists carried out joint research. With the active participation of an outstanding scientist and public figure Alexander Erminingeldovich Arbuzov, almost a month before the end of the World War II, the Council of People’s Commissars of the USSR adopted a resolution to establish the Kazan Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. On April 13, 1945, the Kazan Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences was established in Kazan by the decision of the Council of People’s Commissars of the USSR.\n\nOn August 28, 1945, the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences approved the structure of the Kazan Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences: the Physico-Technical, Chemical, Geological and Biological Institutes, the Institute of Language and Literature, as well as the Water Management, the Energy, the Scientific and Technical Propaganda Sectors.\n\nAlexander E. Arbuzov, Full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences and representative of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Kazan, became the head of the Kazan Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He guided the formation of the original structure of the Kazan Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and the rise and development of its institutions.\n\nSince 1992 – the Kazan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences (KazSC RAS).\n\nAt this time, the Presidium of the KazSC RAS was searching for and introducing new forms of work. The KazSC RAS closely collaborated with the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tatarstan, which incorporated the Institute of Language, Literature and History in 1993. The development of the computer technology made it possible to initiate the creation of the local computer networks at all institutes. Further they served as a basis of the unified telecommunications network of the KazSC RAS.\n\nWhen Aleksandr I. Konovalov, representative of the Kazan chemical school, was elected the Chairman of the Presidium of the KazSC RAS, the scientific and organizational activities of the Presidium included the planning of the work of institutes in conducting joint interdisciplinary research and research focused on the needs of the region. The practical implementation of the results of the scientific activity was searched for.\n\nAs a part of the reform of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), by order of the Government of the Russian Federation of December 30, 2013 all institutes of the KazSC RAS were transferred to the FASO of Russia – the Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations of Russia.\n\nTo continue the reform of RAS basing on the need to most effectively address the basic challenges facing science, the Kazan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences as one of the major regional centers of academic science with the well-known scientific schools in the field of chemistry, physics, biology and other fields of knowledge, was transformed into the Federal Research Center (FRC).\n\nAccording to the administrative documents of the FASO, the institutes integrated into the FRC have to ensure breakthrough researches and practical developments in areas of strategic importance to the country (priority areas in the scientific and technical sphere). These works should both determine the formation of new sectors of post-industrial technology topical for the country and solve the tasks of consolidating the long-term global competitiveness of the basic sectors of the development of the Russian economics, scientific and technological support for the accelerated development of territories defining Russia’s global advantages, and provide the basis for the country’s long-term food independence. FRCs are the organizations that are responsible for achieving concrete results in the implementation of priority areas for the development of science and technology.\n\nThe basis of the Center should be formed by scientific academic organizations – world leaders in priority areas having scientific schools recognized by the scientific community. Taking into account that the solutions of the problems assigned to the FRC have a multi-, inter- and trans-disciplinary character, the coordination of the relevant research and development projects should be carried out within the single research program of the FRC.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, the head of the FASO of Russia issued the Order No. 353 “On the Reorganization of the Federal State Budgetary Institution of Science of the Kazan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences”.\n\nThe process of the reorganization took exactly five months.\n\nOn November 14, 2017, the Head of the FASO signed the Order No. 906 “On approval of the new version of the Charter of the Federal State Budgetary Institution of Science FRC “KazSC RAS”.\n\nOn November 15, 2017, the official opening of the Federal State Budgetary Institution of Science FRC “Kazan Scientific Center RAS” was held at a meeting of the Council for Science and Education under the President of the Republic of Tatarstan. President of the Republic of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov, Head of FASO Mikhail Kotyukov, President of the Russian Academy of Sciences Aleksandr Sergeev, Chairman of the Kazan Scientific Center RAS Oleg Sinyashin, Directors of institutes of the KazSC RAS and other officials took part in the meeting.\n\nOn November 21, 2017, the Kazan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences was renamed the Federal State Budgetary Institution of Science Federal Research Center “Kazan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences” (FRC “KazSC RAS”) in accordance with the Charter approved by the order of the FASO of Russia and on the basis of the entry sheet of the Unified State Register of Legal Entities FRC “KazSC RAS” of November 21, 2017.\n\nThe task of creating the FRC “KazSC RAS” before the end of 2017 was extremely ambitious taking into account both the tight deadlines for the project implementation and the reference of the institutes comprising FRCs to different fields of natural sciences and, accordingly, being under the scientific and methodological guidance of various Departments of RAS – Chemistry and Materials Sciences, Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, etc. However, such diversity made it possible to form the Program of the Development of the FRC “KazSC RAS” not as a compilation of “mono-profile” topics of individual institutions, but in the form of interdisciplinary topics of the fundamental and applied research in priority areas.\n\nThe Federal Research Center “Kazan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences” was established on the basis of the KazSC RAS and united eight organizations subordinated to the FASO of Russia:\n\nArbuzov Institute of Organic and Physical Chemistry\n\nZavoisky Physical-Technical Institute\n\nKazan Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics\n\nInstitute of Mechanics and Engineering\n\nTatar Research Institute of Agriculture\n\nTatar Research Institute of Agricultural Chemistry and Soil Science\n\nInstitute of Power Engineering and Advanced Technologies\n\nPolyclinic of Kazan Scientific Center of the RAS\n\nO.G. Sinyashin, Full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, is appointed the Director of the FRC “KazSC RAS”.\n\nThe Board of Trustees of the FRC “KazSC RAS” is headed by the President of the Republic of Tatarstan R.N. Minnikhanov."
