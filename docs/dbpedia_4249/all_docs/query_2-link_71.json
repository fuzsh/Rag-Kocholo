Her book, “Social Cognition” (1984), co-authored with Shelley Taylor, galvanized the cognitive approach to social psychology into one that now underpins most social psychological research, and she has used her expertise to inspire more equitable social policy and legal decisions, such as in the Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins case on gender discrimination, where her testimony was cited in the Supreme Court decision.\n\nFiske joined the Princeton faculty in 2000 and was named the Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology in 2007. She has been honored for her generous mentoring of students with the University’s Graduate School Mentoring Award, the Association for Psychological Science’s Mentor Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Ambady Award for Mentoring Excellence from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology.\n\nA member of several academic societies, including the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, Fiske received a Ph.D. from Harvard University and a bachelor’s degree from Radcliffe College.\n\nSu Friedrich\n\nFriedrich is a prolific filmmaker whose work has advanced avant-garde American cinema through a feminist lens.

He worked in the Soviet Union for two decades, conducting research and publishing papers that made a lasting mark on elementary particle physics, statistical mechanics and quantum gravity.\n\nPolyakov joined Princeton’s faculty in 1989 as a professor of physics and became the Joseph Henry Professor of Physics in 1999. While at Princeton, his research focused on two-dimensional quantum gravity, which helped provide a definition of certain low-dimensional models of string theory. He later conjectured a modification of this approach to adapt it to the problem of quark confinement and collaborated with his Princeton colleagues Steven Gubser and Igor Klebanov on a seminal paper connecting string theory with quantum gauge field theory.\n\nHe is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Foreign Member of the French Academy of Sciences. He has received numerous awards for his contributions to the field, including the Dirac Medal, the Lorentz Medal, the Oskar Klein Medal, the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics and the Max Planck Medal.\n\nRobert Prud’homme\n\nPrud’homme is a renowned chemical engineer whose expertise has led to the development of treatments for many of the world’s most devastating diseases, such as malaria, toxoplasmosis, diarrhea, tuberculosis and cancer.\n\nThe mixing process that Prud’homme and his team invented and refined, called Flash NanoPrecipitation (FNP), has made a major impact on drug manufacturing and has been adopted globally to produce inexpensive and highly stable medicines. The FNP process is also a foundational technique for manufacturing the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that were first produced in 2020.\n\nPrud’homme earned his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his bachelor’s degree from Stanford University. He joined Princeton’s faculty in 1978 as an assistant professor of chemical engineering. He founded the program in engineering biology, which ran from 1982 to 2014 and laid the groundwork for what would become the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering in 2010.\n\nA holder of more than 100 patents, Prud’homme has worked with numerous companies throughout the course of his career, including Merck, Proctor & Gamble and Schlumberger. He has served on the scientific advisory boards for American Cyanamid, Dow Chemical Company and BASF, and served for a decade on the board of directors for the American Institute for Chemical Engineering’s Materials Science and Engineering Division.

He is especially noted for his research on the social dynamics of mammalian groups and has also contributed substantially to his field’s understanding of social behavior and functional morphology in birds, fish, herps and invertebrates.\n\nFor more than two decades, Rubenstein served as the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology’s chair. He received the President’s Award for Distinguished Teaching in 1999. Rubenstein also helped establish the Mpala Foundation and Research Centre in Kenya and remains a prominent member of the board of directors for Princeton’s Mpala Research Trust.\n\nRubenstein has been involved in numerous conservation organizations around the world, including Earthwatch and Earthwatch International, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Equid Specialist Group, and the Animal Behavior Society. He has served as president of the Princeton chapter of Sigma Xi and is a longtime board member of the Friends of Hopewell Valley Open Space, which works to preserve land across New Jersey.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. from Duke University, an M.A. from Oxford University, an M.A. from Cambridge University, and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan.\n\nHarold T. Shapiro\n\nShapiro served as the 18th president of Princeton University after an illustrious career as an economist and higher education administrator. He continued to teach courses during his tenure as president, and returned to full-time teaching and research afterwards in the Department of Economics and the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.\n\nUnder Shapiro’s leadership, Princeton celebrated its 250th anniversary and saw a period of substantial growth in faculty, enrollment and resources. Through his stewardship, Princeton made history by becoming the first university in the country to remove loans from its financial aid packages.\n\nThe faculty also grew in size and stature during his presidency, and numerous academic programs were launched, including the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, an interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Religion, the Society of Fellows in the Liberal Arts, the University Center for Human Values, and new master’s programs in finance, engineering and public policy. The campus also saw substantial capital improvements, with renovations of residence halls and the construction of buildings such as Frist Campus Center and the Berlind Theatre addition to the McCarter Theatre.\n\nA national leader in matters of science and public policy, Shapiro served President George H.W. Bush as a member and vice chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and as chair of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission under President Bill Clinton.\n\nShapiro has published papers and commentaries on topics ranging from bioethics and science policy to the evolution of postsecondary education. In his book “A Larger Sense of Purpose: Higher Education and Society” (Princeton University Press, 2005), he outlined the history of the modern research university, writing on such issues as ethics, the differences between private and public higher education, and the relationship between universities and corporations.\n\nHis elected memberships include the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, among others. Additionally, Shapiro has served on the boards of dozens of public, nonprofit and private-sector institutions.\n\nIn 2000, Shapiro received the Council of Scientific Society Presidents Citation for Outstanding Leadership.
