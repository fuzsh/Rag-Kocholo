        "text": "ROME, Dec. 31— The Vatican's radio station, but not its daily newspaper, reported today on the announcement in Istanbul yesterday that Athenagoras I, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, would meet Pope Paul in Jerusalem Sunday.\n\nThe silence of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper, reflected the continuing reserve in high church quarters here on efforts toward Christian unity.\n\nL'Osservatore Romano is controlled by the Roman Curia, the Roman Catholic Church's central administrative body, which is known to view the present high‐level contacts with the Orthodox Church with great caution.\n\nWhat little has appeared in the Vatican newspaper on this subject in the last few days is reported to have been printed at theexpress wish of the Pontiff.\n\nIn the last few weeks the Vatican radio, which is entirely staffed by members of the Jesuit order, has consistently showed itself far more informative than the newspaper on the preparations for the meeting between the Pope and the Orthodox Patriarch.\n\nThe only Jesuit in the Sacred College of Cardinals, Augustin Cardinal Bea, heads the Vatican's Secretariat for the Promotion of Christian Unity, which was instrumental in starting the present “dialogue” between Rome and Istanbul.\n\nThe Secretariat is technically an organ of the Roman Catholic Church's Ecumenical Council, but actually it is operating as an autonomous and permanent church department independent of the Curia and reporting directly to the Pope.\n\nThe differences between L'Osservatore Romano and the Vatican radio in the treatment of news on the Pope's pilgrimage to the Holy Land Saturday to Monday was believed to be indicative of a differing evaluation of its ecumenical implications by the Curia and the Secretariat.\n\nThe German‐born Cardinal is the church's foremost spokesman for ecumenism, the movement toward Christian unity.\n\nIn today's news broadcasts in many languages, the Vatican radio gave prominence to yesterday's statement by the Patriarchate of Istanb uI on the program of the journey of Athenagoras I to meet the Pope.\n\nThe radio also reported on remarks by President Shneor Zalman Shazar of Israel yesterday emphasizing the importance of the papal pilgrimage.\n\nThe Vatican broadcasts called attention to the continued presence here of an official envoy of the Orthodox Patriarch in Istanbul who had an audience with the Pope Saturday. The envoy. Metropolitan Athenagoras of Thyatira, was scheduled to return to Istanbul today but has lengthened his stay."
