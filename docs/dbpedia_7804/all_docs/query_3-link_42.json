        "text": "The Portal’s editors welcome collaborative partners to provide free online access to the some of the richest content associated with the history, spirituality, educational heritage, and pedagogical approach of the Society of Jesus.\n\nThe Portal’s editors are very pleased to acknowledge the collaborative assistance they receive from the following institutions:\n\nArchivum Romanum Societatis Iesu (ARSI)\n\nARSI is located on the grounds of the Jesuit General Curia in Rome. It oversees the archives of the central government for the Society of Jesus. ARSI also has a publishing division, Institutum Historicum Societatis Iesu (IHSI). Founded in 1930, the IHSI has several book series and a biennial, peer-reviewed journal, the Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu. The Institute collaborates with ARSI to provide free access to the Jesuit Online Bibliography.\n\nBoston College Libraries\n\nConsisting of eight separate libraries, the Boston College Libraries seek to go beyond helping users find relevant information to integrate information resources into all aspects of teaching, learning, and research, with a particular focus to promote freely accessible online resources. The Institute collaborates closely with the Libraries both in developing the Portal and in providing free online access to the Libraries’ collection of Jesuitica. The Institute also collaborates with the Libraries to provide free access to the Jesuit Online Bibliography and the Jesuit Online Library.\n\nBrill Publishers\n\nBrill Publishers has been one of the world’s leading publishing houses in the humanities for more than three centuries. The Institute collaborates closely with Brill to provide free online access to the Jesuit Historiography Online, the Journal of Jesuit Studies, and selected presentations at the International Symposia on Jesuit Studies.\n\nConimbricenses.org\n\nAs the first digital project on the Coimbra Jesuit Aristotelian tradition, The Conimbricenses.org Project publishes peer-reviewed encyclopedia entries and provides free, worldwide access to digitized versions of the most important documents related to the topic. The Institute collaborates with the project’s director and editor to include the articles within the Portal’s search capabilities.\n\nJesuit Conference of Canada and the United States\n\nThe Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States acts as the liaison between the provinces of North America, various national associations, and the Society’s international headquarters in Rome. The Institute collaborates with the Jesuit Conference to secure permission to provide free online access to the Jesuit Educational Quarterly.\n\nJesuit Sources\n\nJesuit Sources, founded at St. Louis in 1961 as the Institute of Jesuit Sources, has published more than 100 volumes to fill a mission to preserve, maintain, and expand for scholars around the world important texts and studies in Jesuit history, spirituality, and pedagogy. The Institute collaborates with Jesuit Sources to provide free online access to selections of its primary sources in English translation.\n\nThe Jesuitica Project at KU Leuven\n\nThe Jesuitica Project is a collaborative initiative from the University of Leuven (KU Leuven, Belgium) and the Jesuit Region of European Low Countries, the former provinces of the Netherlands and North Belgium (Flanders). Its main goal is to stimulate research into the history and spirituality of the Jesuits by making the rich collections of Jesuit books in the Maurits Sabbe Library accessible and by hosting www.jesuitica.be, a website that offers a virtual portal with digital tools for the research community. The Institute collaborates with the Jesuitica Project to provide free access to the Jesuit Online Bibliography.\n\nMaryland Province of the Society of Jesus\n\nThe Maryland Province has roots dating back to 1634, with the arrival of the first Jesuit missionaries in Maryland, and oversees current works in nine states. The Institute collaborates with the Maryland Province to provide free online access to Woodstock Letters.\n\n(The former) Oregon Province/Jesuits West\n\nIn 2017, the Oregon Province was reunited with the California Province (the two split as distinct provinces in 1932), Jesuits West. The Institute collaborated with the Oregon Province to provide free online access to scholarship by the province’s late historian, Joseph F. Conwell, S.J.\n\nProvince d’Europe Occidentale Francophone\n\nThe Superior General of the Society of Jesus established the Province d’Europe Occidentale Francophone in 2017, combining the Jesuits in French-speaking Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Greece and Mauritius. The Institute collaborates with Europe’s Francophone province to provide free online access to Lettres de Jersey.\n\nProvíncia Portuguesa\n\nThe Jesuits’ province in Portugal was the first established by Ignatius, founded in 1546. The Institute collaborates with Província Portuguesa to provide free online access to História da Companhia de Jesus na Assistência de Portugal, the province’s seven-volume history written by Francisco Rodrigues.\n\nSeminar on Jesuit Spirituality\n\nThe Seminar on Jesuit Spirituality was founded in 1969 by George Ganss, S.J., for the education and edification of Jesuits and continues to publish scholarly essays on issues such as the vows in the Society of Jesus, historical events and figures, and spiritual doctrine of the Jesuits. The Institute collaborates with the Seminar to provide free online access to the Studies in the Spirituality of Jesuits."
