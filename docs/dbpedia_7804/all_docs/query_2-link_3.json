        "text": "Cardinals head of organs of the Roman Curia\n\nOne of the main functions of the cardinals is to act as advisors and assistants to the Roman Pontiff in the government of the Universal Church. Some of them discharge this responsibility heading the dicasteries of the Roman Curia, the central administrative organ of the Church. In the 20th century, three popes issued apostolic constitutions effecting a major reform and reorganization of the Roman Curia: Pius X's Sapienti consilio, June 29, 1908; Paul VI's Regimini Ecclesiae Universae, August 15, 1967; and John Paul II's Pastor bonus, June 28, 1988. Beginning in 1997, Pope John Paul II named some non-cardinal prelates to head Vatican dicasteries; the practice has been continued by Pope Benedict XVI. The main source used for the historical notes is Pontifical Yearbook. Supplement. Historical notes. Città del Vaticano : Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, [n.d.]. Following are the lists of Roman dicasteries headed by cardinals. On June 5, 2022, Solemnity of Pentecost, the Apostolic Constitution \"Praedicate Evangelium” on the Roman Curia and its service to the Church and the World\" went into effect.

The apostolic constitution of Non Debet Reprehensibile issued by Pope Innocent VIII on December 31, 1487 established the Secretaria Apostolica or Collegio dei Segretari Apostolici, comprising 24 apostolic secretaries, one of whom had the title Secretarius Domesticus and held a position of pre-eminence. During the pontificate of Leo X (1513-1521), the office of the Secretarius intimus was created. This office was charged with the correspondence with the apostolic nuncios, who were being appointed with diplomatic prerogatives in permanent fashion. For a long time, the Secretarius Intimus, also called Secretarius Papae or Secretarius Maior, was almost always a prelate, often endowed with episcopal rank. From these beginnings, the Secretariat of State developed, especially at the time of the Council of Trent.\n\nThe Secretariat of State began in this way and was later directed by the cardinal nephew (cardinale nipote), who acted as prime minister of the pope, and gradually developed, in particular at the time of the Council of Trent (1545-1563). The office of secretary intimus was entrusted at the beginning of the pontificate of Innocent X (1644-1655) to someone who was already a cardinal and who did not belong to the pope's family. This personage was Cardinal Giovanni Giacomo Panciroli. Pope Innocent XII (1691-1700), with the bull Romanum decet Pontificum, dated June 22, 1692, abolished the office of Cardinal Nephew, who by then had become the General superintendent of the Papal States. The cardinal secretary of State took over his powers permanently. In 1814, Pope Pius VII established the Sacred Congregation for the Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, expanding the Congregation Super Negotiis Ecclesiasticis Regni Galliarum established by Pope Pius VI in 1793. Pope Pius X, in his apostolic constitution Sapienti Consilio, June 29, 1908, divided the Secretariat of State into three sections: the first was concerned essentially with extraordinary affairs, while the second attended to the ordinary affairs, and the third, until then an independent body (the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs), had the duty of preparing and dispatching pontifical briefs, of which the first, became later the S.C. for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. This was confirmed by canon 263 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law. The apostolic constitution Regimi Ecclesiae Universae, issued by Paul VI on August 15, 1967, reformed the Roman Curia, implementing the desire expressed by the bishops in the Second Vatican Council. This gave a new face to the Secretariat of State, suppressing the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs, formerly the third section, and transforming the former first section, the Sacred Congregation for the Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, into a body distinct from the Secretariat of State, though closely related to it, which was to be known as the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church.\n\nJohn Paul II with the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus, June 28, 1988, introduced a reform of the Roman Curia and divided the Secretariat of State into two sections: the Section for General Affairs and the Section for Relations with States, which incorporated the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church. This guaranteed both unity of purpose and the specificity required in the service which the Secretariat of State is called to offer the pope.\n\nFirst Section. The Section for General Affairs or the First Section is responsible for handling matters regarding the everyday service of the Supreme Pontiff, both in caring for the universal Church and in dealing with the dicasteries of the Roman Curia. It attends to the preparation of whatever documents the Holy Father entrusts to it. It enacts the provisions for appointments within the Roman Curia and keeps custody of the Lead Seal and the Fisherman's Ring. It regulates the duties and activity of the Holy See's representatives, especially in relation to the local Churches. It attends to all that concerns the embassies accredited to the Holy See. It supervises the Holy See's official communication agencies and is responsible for publishing the Acta Apostolicæ Sedis and the Annuario Pontificio. The First Section of the Secretariat of State is headed by an archbishop, who is assisted by a prelate, the assessor for general affairs. The position of the substitute first appeared in the hierarchical listing of the Secretariat of State in 1814.\n\nSecond Section. The Section for Relations with States or Second Section has the specific duty of attending to matters which involve civil governments. It has responsibility for (1) the Holy See's diplomatic relations with states, including the establishment of concordats or similar agreements; (2) for the Holy See's presence in international organizations and conferences; (3) in special circumstances, by order of the Supreme Pontiff and in consultation with the competent dicasteries of the Curia, provides for appointments to particular Churches, and for their establishment or modification; (4) in close collaboration with the Congregation for Bishops, it attends to the appointment of bishops in countries which have entered into treaties or agreements with the Holy See in accordance with the norms of international law. The Second Section is headed by an archbishop, the secretary for relations with states, who is aided by a prelate, the undersecretary for relations with states, and assisted by cardinals and bishops.\n\nSecretaries of State:\n\nGiovanni Giacomo Panciroli (1644-1651)\n\nDecio Azzolini, iuniore, pro-secretary (1651)\n\nFabio Chigi (1651-1655)\n\nGiulio Rospigliosi (1655-1667)\n\nDecio Azzolini, iuniore (1667-1669)\n\nFederico Borromeo, iuniore (1670-1673)\n\nFrancesco Nerli, iuniore (1673-1676)\n\nAlderano Cibo (1676-1689)\n\nGiambattista Rubini (1689-1691)\n\nFabrizio Spada (1691-1700)\n\nFabrizio Paolucci (1700-1721)\n\nGiorgio Spinola (1721-1724)\n\nFabrizio Paolucci (1724-1726)\n\nNiccolò Maria Lercari (1726-1730)\n\nAntonio Banchieri (1730-1733)\n\nGiuseppe Firrao (1733-1740)\n\nSilvio Valenti Gonzaga (1740-1756)\n\nAlberico Archinto (1756-1758)\n\nLuigi Maria Torreggiani (1758-1769)\n\nLazzaro Opizio Pallavicino (1769-1785)\n\nlgnazio Boncompagni-Ludovisi (1785-1789)\n\nFrancesco Saverio de Zelada (1789-1796)\n\nIgnazio Busca (1796-1797)\n\nGiuseppe Maria Doria Pamphili (1797-1799)\n\nErcole Consalvi, pro-secretary (1800); secretary (1800-1806)\n\nFilippo Casoni (1806-1808)\n\nGiulio Gabrielli (1808)\n\nGiuseppe Maria Doria Pamphilj, pro-secretary (1808)\n\nBartolomeo Pacca, seniore, pro-secretary (1808-1814)\n\nErcole Consalvi (1814-1823)\n\nGiulio Maria della Somaglia (1823-1828)\n\nTommaso Bernetti (1828-1829)\n\nGiuseppe Albani (1829-1830)\n\nTommaso Bernetti, pro-secretary (1831); secretary (1831-1836)\n\nLuigi Lambruschini, C.R.S.P.

Its task was to erect and to divide dioceses and to appoint bishops in those cases in which it is necessary to take these matters up with civil governments, as also to discuss those matters which the pope may turn over to it through the cardinal secretary of State, especially those dealing with civil laws, concordats, or other agreements entered into between the Holy See and different countries (can. 255; Letter of Pius XI, July 5, 1925; Acta Apostolicæ Sedis, vol.

The Congregation was again reorganized and had its name changed to its present form by Pope Paul VI's motu proprio Integrae servanda, of December 7, 1965. Until 1968, the pope held the title of prefect but never exercised this office. Instead, he appointed a cardinal to preside over the meetings, first as secretary and then as pro-prefect.

Pope Gregory XIII widened its field of competence, and Pope Sixtus V entrusted to it the revision of the acts of provincial councils and, in general, the task of carrying out the reforms prescribed by the Council of Trent. When the task of interpreting the canons of the celebrated council no longer existed, the Congregation retained competence over many matters which were the object of the reforms introduced by Trent. In fact, in general it kept watch over the discipline of the clergy and the faithful (can. 250, § 1), directed catechetical instruction and saw to the observance of the precepts of the Christian life. It exercised its authority over pastors, canons, confraternities, pious associations, Catholic Action, pious legacies, benefices, offices, ecclesiastical property, taxes and tributes (can. 250, §§ 2-3), and retained the right to revise the acts of councils and of episcopal conferences (can. 250, § 4). As part of the Sacred Congregation there is the \"Studium\", which was reorganized by Pope Benedict XV with an order issued on October 28, 1919, in order that young priests may acquire practical experience in the ordinary and regular dispatching of ecclesiastical business and in the particular applications of canonical laws in the administrative field.\n\nThe dicastery was known as Congregation of the Council until August 15, 1967, when Pope Paul VI renamed it the Congregation for the Clergy and redefined its competency through the apostolic constitution Regimini Ecclesiae Universae. Pope John Paul II gave it added responsibilities on June 28, 1988 by the apostolic constitution Pastor Bonus.\n\nCurrently, the congregation has three offices with competencies concerning the life, discipline, rights and duties of the clergy (Office of the Clergy); the preaching of the Word, catechetics, norms for religious education of children and adults (Office of Catechetics); preservation and administration of the temporal goods of the Church (Administrative Office). Attached to it are the International Council for Catechetics, which was established in 1973 by Pope Paul VI; and the Institute \"Sacrum Ministerium\" for the permanent formation of the clergy, established in line with Pope John Paul II's 1992 apostolic exhortation Pastores Dabo Vobis, which was annexed to the congregation in the academic year 1994-1995. In that same year, the journal \"Sacrum Ministerium\", published twice a year, was founded. The congregation has competency over the dispensation of the obligations inherent to the sacred ordination of the diaconate and the presbyterate of the regular and diocesan clergy of the Latin and Oriental Churches, according to the letter of the Secretariat of State, no. 907 of June 21, 2005.\n\nPrefects:\n\nCarlo Borromeo (1564-1565)\n\nFrancesco Alciati (1565-1580)\n\nFilippo Boncompagni (1580-1586)\n\nAntonio Carafa (1586-1591)\n\nGirolamo Mattei (1591-1603)\n\nPaolo Emilio Zacchia (1604-1605)\n\nFrancesco Maria Bourbon del Monte (1606-1616)\n\nOrazio Lancellottti (1616-1620)\n\nRoberto Ubaldini (1621-1623)\n\nCosimo de Torres (1623-1626)\n\nBonifacio Bevilacqua Aldobrandini (1626-1627)\n\nFabrizio Verospi (1627-1639)\n\nGiambattista Pamphilj (1639-1644)\n\nFrancesco Cennini de' Salamandri (1644-1645)\n\nPier Luigi Carafa, seniore (1645-1655)\n\nFrancesco Paolucci (1657-1661)\n\nGiulio Cesare Sacchetti (1661-1663)\n\nAngelo Celsi (1664-1671)\n\nPaluzzo Paluzzi Altieri degli Albertoni (1671-1672)\n\nVincenzo Maria Orsini de Gravina, O.P.

Since the time of Pope Clement V (1305-1314), his faculties no longer expire with the death of the pope ( 1311 - 1312). From the beginning he was assisted by \"Penitentiary Chaplains\" (or \"Minor Penitentiaries \"), who still exist in the patriarchal Basilicas and other basilicas which are directly dependent on the Holy See, but without forming part of the Tribunal of the Sacred Penitentiary.\n\nAs early as the thirteenth century we find correctors, writers, distributors, and the sealer. Pope Benedict XII (1334-1342) added the office of \"Doctor Expert in Canon Law\" (April 13, 1338). The office of \"Regent\" existed under Pope Eugenius IV (April 13, 1438), and that of \"Datary\" under Pope Alexander VI (1491-1503). Pope Pius V (1566-1572), after having revoked all the faculties of the cardinal penitentiary and having suppressed the Penitentiary itself (April 23, 1569), re-established it (May 18, 1569) after a radical reform, reducing to an absolute minimum the faculties of the cardinal penitentiary in foro externo, and creating the office of \"Theologian\" which, by privilege, is reserved to the Society of Jesus, and also the Office of \"Canonist \". A further reorganization of the faculties and the procedure of the S. Penitentiary took place under Pope Benedict XIV (April I3, 1744); with some modifications, its constitutions remained unchanged under the reform of Pope Pius X, who restricted its jurisdiction exclusively to the internal forum, and under a further reform by Pope Benedict XV (1914-1922), who separated the Office of Indulgences from the Holy Office and placed it under the S. Penitentiary (March 25, 1917). These constitutions served as the basis for the apostolic constitution De poenitentiaria apostolica of Pope Pius XI (March 25, 1935). The Congresses for the Tribunal and for Indulgences are held by the regent and by the secretary, along with the substitute of the respective section. The prelates of the Penitentiary meet periodically, under the presidency of the cardinal grand penitentiary, for whom they act as a council, in the meeting which has the name of Signature of the Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary.\n\nThe apostolic constitution Pastor bonus issued on June 28, 1988, by Pope John Paul II (1978-2005), confirmed that the competence of the Tribunal of the Penitentiary comprises all that belongs to the foro interno although not sacramental and moreover all that related to the concessions and the use of the indulgences, except the right of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to examine all matters related to the dogmatic doctrine about the indulgences.\n\nGrand penitentiaries:\n\nCardinal anonymous\n\n, to whom Pope Alexander III confessionum cura iniunxerat (1179)\n\nGiovanni, of the title of Santa Prisca, qui confessiones pro papa recipiebat (ca. 1200)\n\nUgo, of the title of San Martino (1203)\n\nNiccolò de Romanis (1213-1219?)\n\nTommaso da Capua (1223-1234/1239?)\n\nOttone di Monferrato (1245-?)\n\nHugues de Saint-Cher, O.P.

There has been a permanent Office of the Signature from the time that Pope Eugenius IV (1431-1417) turned over to the referendaries themselves the signature of certain petitions. The division of this Signature, known as the Signature of favor and commissions under Pope Sixtus IV (1471-1484), into two dicasteries, had already begun under Pope Alexander VI (May 4, 1493) and was completed by Julius II (1503-1513). Beginning with the end of the fifteenth century there are cardinal prefects for the two Signatures, of which the Signature of Justice was transformed into a real Tribunal. The growing number of the referendaries of the two Signatures led as a practical measure to the formation of a select group known as the voting referendaries, which was erected on July 13, 1659 by Pope Alexander VII (1655-1667) into a college in its own right and which was to draw its members from the ranks of the simple referendaries, who had only consultative voice. With the creation of the Sacred Congregations and the widening held of competence of the Rota and the Apostolic Chamber -- which did not need special orders from the Sovereign Pontiff -- the duties of the Signature gradually diminished, and it eventually became mainly a tribunal of appeal (even for civil cases from the Papal States, according to a decree of Gregory XVI, November 10, 1834). The Signature of favor, which was transformed into a congregation on January 22, 1588 by Pope Sixtus V 1585-1590), lost its importance with the evolution of the Datary, which, from the time of Pope Clement IX (1667-1669) and in the seventeenth century, took over the granting of almost all favors.\n\nThe Holy Father Pope Pius X re-established the one sole Apostolic Signature (Constitution, Sapienti Consilio and the Lex Propria S. R. Rotae Signaturae Apostolicae, June 29, 1908) as a Supreme Tribunal, transforming it into a committee of six Cardinals, one of whom was to act as prefect. But with of the 1917 Code of Canon Law the number of cardinals composing the Signature was left unrestricted (can. 1602). Pope Benedict XV (1914-1922) re-established the College of Votanti and that of the Referendaries as consultative organs of the Tribunal (Chirograph, June 28, 1915).\n\nThe Apostolic Signature judges with ordinary power: 1) in appeals based on a violation of secrecy by the Auditors of the Rota and on damages caused by the same through unjust or invalid acts; 2) in objections of suspicion against the Auditors of the Rota; 3) in claims of nullity against decisions of the Rota; 4) in requests for restitution against Rotal decisions which have become final; 5) in appeals against Rotal decisions in matrimonial cases which the Rota has refused to admit for further investigation; 6) in conflicts of competence between ecclesiastical tribunals which are not apostolic, conformably to can. 1612, § 2. In virtue of delegated jurisdiction, it deals with petitions of commission to refer a judgment to the Sacred Rota. Lastly, through decisions to be submitted for the approval of the Holy Father, it passes judgment on any question connected with the administration of justice.\n\nThe faculties and privileges of the voting prelates and of the referendary prelates are determined by the apostolic constitution Ad incrementum, issued by Pope Pius XI (1922-1939) on August 15, 1934, and later modified by the Normae speciales Signaturae Apostolicae, approved by Pope Paul VI (1963-1978) on March 23, 1968.\n\nThe current competence of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signature was established by the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus, of June 28, 1988, art. 121-125.\n\nConcerning strictly the judicial powers of the Apostolic Signature, it judges: the complaints of invalidity, the demands for restitutio in integrum against the Rotal sentences; the recourses in the causes on the status of the persons, that the Roman Rota refused to admit to new examination; the causes against the Auditors of the Roman Rota for actions during the exercise of their functions; the conflicts of competence according to the can. 1416. As a litigation-administrative court, the Tribunal decides: the disputes resulting from an ecclesiastical administrative action, legitimately submitted; in these cases, besides the illegitimacy judgment, it can also adjudicate, if the recurrent asks for it, the approximate reparation of the damages brought by the illegitimate act; the other administrative controversies submitted to it by the Roman Pontiff or the dicasteries of the Roman Curia; and the conflicts of competence between the same dicasteries. In virtue of the administrative power concerning the judicial forum, the Tribunal is expected to: supervise the fair administration of justice; extend the competence of the courts; to promote and to approve of the erection of the courts according to canons 1423 and 1439. The Tribunal also has other duties deriving from the juridical organization of the State of Vatican City and from certain concordats (e. g. the Concordat with Italy, art. 34; the Concordat with Portugal, art. 25; the Concordat with Santo Domingo, art. 16).\n\nThe Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signature is formed by cardinals, archbishops, and bishops appointed by the pope.

In this office were absorbed the more ancient charges of vestiarius, vice-dominus, arcarius, and sacellarius. Beginning with the XIII century, this office no longer lapsed with the death of the Pope. In the XIII and XlV centuries it acquired certain jurisdictional functions, not merely in matters of finance but also in some penal and civil cases. Pope Urban VI (1378-1389) extended its competence to all causes dealing, even indirectly, with the rights and interests of the camera (September 8, 1379). The camerlengo was often a cardinal, but it became a cardinalitial office only from the XV century. Beginning at this same period there was also a permanent assistant, known as the vice-camerlengo, which office was later united with that of governor of Rome. The clerics of the camera, who assisted the camerlengo, varied in number from century to century; Pope Eugenius IV (1431-1447) organized them into a college and gave them their first statutes (July 6, 1444). For the duties connected with the collection of income, the custody of the treasury, and payments, we find, in the XIII century, the thesaurarius, or treasurer. For the handling of judicial cases, the office of auditor camerae was set up in the XIII century; the powers of this office were increased in 1485 by Pope Innocent VIII (1484-1492), and, after a brief period of suppression under Pope Paul IV (1555-1559), also in 1562 by Pope Pius IV (1559-1565) and other popes.\n\nThe individual clerics, the auditor camerae, and the treasurer had each acquired certain special prerogatives and presided over special tribunals, but the camera plena also functioned as a collegiate tribunal in which, however, beginning in the XVI century, the cardinal camerlengo no longer exercised his right to preside. On October 30, 1800, Pope Pius VII (1800-1823) formally established a certain dependence of the Camera on the camerlengo. During the XIX century the Camera was mainly a court for the Papal States.\n\nWith the apostolic constitution Sapienti Consilio (June 29, 1908), Pope Pius X (1903-1914) confirmed to the Apostolic Camera the functions of temporal power that it had exercised from antiquity. The office, powers, and privileges of the prelate-clerics of the Apostolic Camera were definitively determined by Pope Pius XI (1922-1939) in the constitution Ad incrementum, August 15, 1934. With the apostolic constitution Regimini Ecclesiae Universae (August 15, 1967), issued by Pope Paul VI (1963-1978), the Camera, under the presidency of the cardinal camerlengo of Holy Roman Church or the vice-camerlengo if he is impeded, keeps the office of caring and administering the temporal goods and rights of the Holy See during the sede vacante.\n\nThe functions of the cardinal camerlengo and of the camerali during the sede vacante, already enhanced by the apostolic constitution Vacantis Apostolicea Sedis (December 8, 1945), of Pope Pius XII (1939-1958), and by the motu proprio Summi Pontifici electio (September 5, 1962) of Pope John XXIII (1958-1963), were integrally confirmed by the apostolic constitution Romano Pontifici eligendo, no. 17 (October 1, 1975) of Pope Paul VI and reaffirmed by the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus (June 28, 1988) of Pope John Paul II (1978-2005).\n\nCamerlengos of the Holy Roman Church (1):\n\nCencio (1189-1198)\n\nOttaviano dei conti di Segni (1198-1213?)\n\nStefano di Ceccano, O.Cist.

The two Congregations are placed under the same prefect by Pope Clement VIII beginning in 1593; they are named from 1601 with the unique title of S. Congregatio negotiis et consultationibus Episcoporum et Regulariumpraeposita, known as Congregatio episcoporum et regularium.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries there were conflicts of competence with two other dicasteries of the Roman Curia: the Congregation of the Regular Discipline, instituted in 1698, and the Congregation on the Status of Regular Orders, created in 1846. In 1856, Pope Pius IX decided that from that moment the prefects of the Congregation for Bishops and Regulars assumed additionaly the charge of prefects of the Congregation of the Discipline of Regulars. Its competence included at the beginning of the 19th century all the questions related to the diocesan administration diocésaine and to the discipline of the Regular Orders, masculine and femenine. The Bull Post diuturnas (October 30, 1800) attributed to this congregation, at the expense of the auditor general of the Apostolic Chamber, the examining of all the criminal cases coming from episcopal curias. The Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, which was one of the principal dicasteries of the Curia in the 19th century, was suppressed by the Constitution Sapienti consilio (June 29, 1908) of Pope Pius X; its responsibilities were attributed to two different congregations: the old Congregation Consistorial, which in 1967 became the Congregation for Bishops; and the new Congregation for Regulars. At the dawn of the Restauration, the Congregation comprised cardinal-prefect, an elevated number of cardinals, a secretary, an under-secretary, a judge relator, and employess. Pope Gregory XVI added consultors (Decree of September 5, 1834) and one sommiste (July 14, 1842). The see of the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars was in the domicile of the secretary. In 1906 the Congregations of the Discipline of Regulars and of the Status of Regular Orders were suppressed and their competence given to the Congregatione of Bishops and Regulars.\n\nPrefects:\n\nMarco Antonio Maffei (1576-1583)\n\nNicolas de Pellevé (1583-1594)\n\nMichelle Bonelli, O.P.

Congregatio super residentia episcoporum was convoked for the first time by Pope Urban VIII on March 28, 1635 in conformity with the Constitution Sancta synodus Tridentina of December 12, 1634. This Congregation constituted a particular dicastery to control the residence of the diocesan bishops, under the supervision that since 1564 had been attributed to the Congregation of the Tridentine Council. Having been inactive during the the 17th century, the Congregation of the Residence was was reactivated with the same functions by Pope Benedict XIV in the middle of the 18th century by the Constitution Ad universae christianae reipublicae of September 3, 1746. Definitively suppressed in 1908 by Pope Pius X, its attributions were devolved to the Consistorial Congregation. Placed under the authority of the Cardinal Vicar of Rome pro-tempore, the Congregation of the Residence of Bishops was composed at the dawn of the Restoration by five cardinals members (three members by right: the cardinal pro-Datary, the cardinal Secretary of State, and the secretary of Briefs) and of a secretary who was the secretary of the Congregation of the Tridentine Council pro-tempore.

It received the attribution of ensuring compliance and the conservation of all the ecclesiastical immunities enjoyed by the Church throughout the territory of the Catholicity. Its competence was successively reinforced and precised by the Constitutions Ex quo, divina disponente of June 8, 1725, of Pope Benedict XIII; and In supremo iustitiae solio of February 1, 1735, of Pope Clement XII, Officii nostri of March 15, 1750, of Pope Benedict XIV; and Praestat Romanum Ponteficem of September 27, 1766, of Pope Clement XIII. Before the restriction of its attributions during the 19th century, in the course of the affirmation of public law and of the signature of concordats, Pope Gregory XVI confirmed and reduced its attributions for a new regulation of criminal procedure (November 5, 1831) and a motu proprio dated November 10, 1834. Progressively emptied of all substance, the Congregation of the Immunity was united «provisionally» - but, in reality, definitively - to that of the Council at the death of its last prefect, Cardinal Filippo Maria Guidi on February 27, 1879, by a decision of Pope Leo XIII inserted in Gerarchia Cattolica and confirmed in the Code of Canon Law (can 250.3).

Pope John Paul II established, among other things, that the \"Fabric of Saint Peter's basilica continue, according to its own laws, to take care itself of all that concerns Basilica of the Prince of the Apostles for the conservation and decorum of the building, for the internal discipline of the caretakers, and for the pilgrims who visit the temple\". To the Fabric of Saint Peter's is given, according to the statute, a cardinal president, assisted by a delegate. One and the other invested with the respective charges in the Committee with Administration. Within the Fabric operates the \"Study of the Vatican Mosaic\", which began its artistic activity under Pope Sixtus V (1585-1590), and was erected canonically under Pope Benedict XIII (1724-1730). The delegate is at the same time president of \"Study of the Vatican Mosaic\". The cardinal president of the Fabric is the protector of the Archconfraternity of the SS.mo Sacramento of the Vatican basilica, and the delegate is the primicerius.\n\nPrefects:\n\nMariano Rampolla del Tindaro (1908-1913)\n\nRafael Merry del Val y Zulueta (1913-1930)\n\nEugenio Pacelli (1930-1939)\n\nFederico Tedeschini (1939-1959)\n\nDomenico Tardini (1959-1961)\n\nPaolo Marella (1961-1968)\n\nTop Catalogs Home Search\n\nCongregation Ceremonial\n\nIt was founded by Pope Sixtus V, in the constitution Immensa aeterni Dei, January 22, 1588, to supervise the liturgical and the non-liturgical ceremonies of the Roman Curia.

They were in charge of drawing up the pontifical acts and, in their quality as scriniarii, also supervised the archives. Towards the end of the VIII century the duties of the primicerius passed to the Librarian who, under Pope Gelasius II (1118-1119) was a cardinal. This office disappeared in order to make way, under Pope Lucius II (1144-1145), for a cardinal chancellor. From the time of Pope Honorius III (1216-1227) onwards, the chancellorship was entrusted to persons not of cardinalitial rank and the name was changed to vice-chancellor. This name was preserved when, under Pope John XXII (1316-1334), the supervision of this office was definitively placed in the hands of a cardinal. It was only under Pope Pius X (1903-1914) that the name of chancellor of Holy Roman Church was restored. His cardinalitial title is always the church of S. Lorenzo in Damaso as mandated by Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) in the constitution Etsi ad singula issued on July 5, 1532 .\n\nFrom the end of the XIV century, the vice-chancellor has been assisted by a Regent, or Lieutenant. Side by side with the ancient notaries (who were called protonotaries from the XIV century on). We find in the XIII century, for the drawing up of bulls and because of the increased activity of the chancery, a numerous staff of abbreviatores, correctores, scriptores, and plumbstores.\n\nFrom the XV century on, the competence of the chancery was much reduced through the introduction of the Apostolic Brief and the creation of the secretariat of briefs. At the same time the functions of the protonotaries were almost completely absorbed by the abbreviatores litterarum apostolicarum, who were organized in various colleges (de parco majore et minore, de prima visione), and who, under the supervision of the vice-chancellor and the regent, also enjoyed e train jurisdictional functions. Other colleges, such as the sollicitatores etc., with less important duties, were suppressed in large part in 1678 by Pope Innocent XI (1676-1689) and Pope Pius VII (1800-1823), and then completely eliminated in 1901 by Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903). The abbreviatores de parco majore remained until the reform of Pope Pius X and were suppressed by the apostolic constitution Sapienti Consilio of June 29, 1908. Their duties were once more turned over to the college of the apostolic protonotaries de numero participantium. The chancery drew up and despatched the decretal letters of canonization the pontifical bulls dealing with appointments to consistorial benefices and offices, the erection of new dioceses and chapters and certain other affairs of major importance, on instructions from the congregations or by order of the Sovereign Pontiff personally.\n\nThe office was abolished by the motu proprio Quo aptius of February 27, 1973, issued by by Pope Paul VI (1963-1978). Its functions were transferred to the secretariat of State.\n\nVice-chancellors:\n\nPierre Arnaud de Puyanne, O.S.B. (1306)\n\nArnaud Nouvel, O.Cist.
