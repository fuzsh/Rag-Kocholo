        "text": "3. Ethical Challenges in Organoid Use\n\nOverall, organoids present with enormous potential for drug screening, disease modelling and therapeutic applications. However, their derivation and their current or future applications, raise a number of ethical issues that are discussed below. Some of the ethical dilemmas posed by organoids are similar to the ones raised by debatable issues existing for decades, such as research in human embryos and use of ESCs or informed consent and privacy of donors whose materials, e.g., cells, are used in existing technologies. Nevertheless, the use and storage of organoids pose additional, novel ethical challenges related to the potential acquisition of human “characteristics or qualities”, to their moral and legal status, to the level of acceptable organ maturation for certain applications, whether their creation constitutes life or whether they deserve special protection."
