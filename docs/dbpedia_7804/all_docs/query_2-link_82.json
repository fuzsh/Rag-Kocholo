        "text": "This request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of recital 17, Article 6(c), Article 9(2)(a) and (f), Article 9(3), Article 10(1)(d) and Article 15(a) and (b) of Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted (OJ 2011 L 337, p. 9).\n\nThe request has been made in proceedings between WS and Intervyuirasht organ na Darzhavna agentsia za bezhantsite pri Ministerskia savet (Interviewing Body of the State Agency for Refugees at the Council of Ministers; ‘the DAB’) concerning a decision refusing to open a procedure for granting international protection further to a subsequent application made by WS.\n\nWS is a Turkish national, of Kurdish ethnicity, a Sunni Muslim and divorced. She arrived legally in Bulgaria in June 2018. Thereafter, she joined a family member in Berlin (Germany), where she lodged an application for international protection. By a decision of the DAB of 28 February 2019, adopted following a request from the German authorities, WS was taken back by the Bulgarian authorities for the purpose of examining her application for international protection. During three interviews conducted by the DAB in October 2019, WS stated that she had been forcibly married at the age of sixteen and had three daughters. Her husband allegedly beat her during their married life, but her biological family, who were aware of the situation, gave her no assistance. WS fled the marital home in September 2016, entered into a\n\nreligious marriage in 2017 and had a son from that marriage in May 2018. After leaving Türkiye, she officially divorced her first husband in September 2018, despite his objections. She stated that, for those reasons, she fears that his family would kill her if she were to return to Türkiye. Before the DAB, WS produced the decision, which had become final, of the Turkish civil court which granted her divorce, together with the complaint which she had lodged against her husband, her biological family and her former husband’s family in January 2017 with the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Torbali (Türkiye), the minutes of which, drawn up on 9 January 2017, refer to the threatening telephone messages which her husband had sent her. She also produced a decision of a Turkish court of 30 June 2017 placing her in a house for women who are victims of violence, in which she claimed not to feel safe. By a decision of 21 May 2020, the President of the DAB rejected WS’s application for international protection, taking the view, first, that the reasons relied on by WS for leaving Türkiye, in particular acts of domestic violence or death threats by her husband and by members of her biological family, were not relevant for the purpose of granting that status, since they could not be linked to any of the reasons for persecution set out in Article 8(1) of the ZUB. Furthermore, WS did not claim to be the victim of acts of persecution based on\n\nher gender.\n\nThis request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of recital 17, Article 6(c), Article 9(2)(a) and (f), Article 9(3), Article 10(1)(d) and Article 15(a) and (b) of Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted (OJ 2011 L 337, p. 9).\n\nThe request has been made in proceedings between WS and Intervyuirasht organ na Darzhavna agentsia za bezhantsite pri Ministerskia savet (Interviewing Body of the State Agency for Refugees at the Council of Ministers; ‘the DAB’) concerning a decision refusing to open a procedure for granting international protection further to a subsequent application made by WS."
