        "text": "April is Donate Life Month. As of April 14, 121,185 people are waiting for an organ, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services website. Twenty-two people will die each day waiting for an organ, and one organ donor can save up to eight lives. Organ transplantation has become an accepted medical treatment for end-stage organ failure. Most major religions in the United States support organ donation and consider donation as the final act of love and generosity toward others.\n\nA baby who lived only 100 minutes in 2015 donated his kidneys to an adult.\n\nOrgan donation is a very personal yet complex decision, intertwined with medical, legal, religious, cultural, and ethical issues.\n\nAlthough the majority of religions and denominations back the idea of organ donation as a charitable action of giving and love, the need for organ donors is much higher than the number of actual donors. Religions usually support organ donation because of life-saving capabilities and as an act of charity.\n\nSome, however, restrict types of organs or means of harvesting. Some ask for the donor’s written consent in advance. Few believe that organ donation should be mandatory.\n\nPer the BBC, many followers of Shinto oppose the taking of organs because of idea of the wholeness of the physical body. Shinto traditions also state that interfering with a corpse brings bad luck.\n\nAccording to the abstract “Religious aspects of organ transplantation” (Paolo Bruzzone, May 2008) published on the U.S. National Library of Medicine website, no religion formally forbids donation or receipt of organs or is against transplantation from living or deceased donors. Only some orthodox Jews may have religious objections to \"opting in.\" However, transplantation from deceased donors may be discouraged by Native Americans, Roma Gypsies, Confucians, Shintoists, and some Orthodox rabbis. Some South Asia Muslim ulemas (scholars) and muftis (jurists) oppose donation from human living and deceased donors because the human body is an \"amanat\" (trusteeship) from God and must not be desecrated following death. No religion formally obliges one to donate or refuse organs. No religion formally obliges one to consider cadaveric organs \"a societal resource\" or considers organ donation \"a religious duty\" (except some rabbis and isolated Muslim and Christian scholars). Living organ donation is strongly encouraged only between Christians. No religion forbids this practice.\n\nPer Wikipedia, His Holiness Pope Francis is an organ donor.\n\nWe asked our panel of distinguished religious leaders of the region the following question: How does your religion/denomination view organ donation?\n\nHere is what they have to say:\n\nSAVING A LIFE\n\nElizaBeth Webb Beyer, rabbi, Temple Beth Or and N. Tahoe Hebrew Congregation\n\nIn Judaism, saving a life (pikuakh nefesh) is of the highest priority. Thus, all denominations encourage organ donation. A living person is permitted to donate organs (i.e. kidneys) as long as it does not jeopardize their health.\n\nIn the case of organ donation following death, this is also permitted. Often such a gift helps families cope with tragic circumstances. Ideally, organ procurement must be done soon after cardiac death. This means that an organ donor is removed from life support briefly in order to obtain a declaration of death. The donor is then put back on life support, to ensure that the organs to be donated remain viable. Although there has been much discussion on this issue, the official position of most rabbis and the state of Israel is that this procedure is permitted in order to save lives.\n\nCHURCH ENCOURAGES IT\n\nStephen R. Karcher, St. Anthony Greek Orthodox Church presiding priest\n\nOur teaching about human life is based on Holy Tradition, including the Scriptures and the ongoing teaching and interpretation of the Orthodox Faith. All life is precious. Human life is uniquely created by God in his image and likeness, thus deserving deep respect. As for organ donation, the Church considers it an act of love and encourages it. A living donation requires considerable consideration and should be made in consultation with medical professionals and one’s Spiritual Father. A donation from one deceased is also an act of love, suitable if the deceased donor had willed such action, or if surviving relatives permit it providing that it was in harmony with the desires of the deceased. In every situation, respect for the body of the donor should be maintained, and any donation should always be made with the intent to maintain the body’s dignity which includes providing for an open-casket funeral.\n\nTREAT ORGANS WITH RESPECT\n\nBradley S. Corbin, Baha’i teacher\n\nThe sacred writings of the Baha’i Faith do not directly address the donation of organs. Our Universal House of Justice has not made any official decree on the subject, other than at this time organ donation is left up to the individual. \"There is nothing in the teachings which would forbid a Bahá'í to bequeath his eyes to another person or for a hospital; on the contrary it seems a noble thing to do,\" said Shoghi Effendi. Organs donated while alive or after death should be treated with respect. “A Bahá'í when dissecting a human body for the purposes of medical study, should keep in mind that since the body was once the temple of the spirit it must be treated with respect even though there is no further connection between the two\" (Lights of Guidance, no. 986).Though the body dies the soul survives physical death and continues to exist forevermore in the spirit world.\n\nAN ACT OF LOVE\n\nSteve Bond, senior pastor, Summit Christian Church, Sparks\n\nThe Bible does not directly mention organ donation. However, it speaks often about self-sacrificing love. Jesus said, “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (John 13:34-35).\n\nDonating an organ to give life to another person is one of the most loving decisions we can make. It is a consummate act of self-sacrifice.\n\nAll of us struggle with an incessant tug from the flesh to put ourselves first. As infants we cry when we don’t get our way and, in one form or another, we battle selfishness until our final breath.\n\nHowever, the essence of love is living beyond ourselves. As organ donors we make our final decision on earth one of the most loving we ever make.\n\nTOUGH CHOICES\n\nKenneth G. Lucey, UNR philosophy/religion professor\n\nOrgan donation is very much a 20th-century concept. The procedure presupposes knowledge of the chemicals required to suppress the body’s rejection of foreign tissue. In the Middle Ages, Christianity was opposed to bodily dissection, and scientists had to conduct their anatomical investigations in secret to avoid condemnation by the church.\n\nA thought experiment concerning organ harvesting is used to make an ethical point. Suppose a fellow named Jim is dying. In the same hospital with him are five other patients in need of the healthy organs Jim possesses. Jim’s death is inevitable, but won’t occur for another month. All five of the others are expected to die within the week. Is it ethical to speed up Jim’s inevitable demise to save the other five? Jim himself is unwilling to have his organs harvested prior to his natural death. This displays the conflict between utilitarianism and the Hippocratic Oath.\n\nWITHOUT ANY HARM\n\nSherif A. Elfass, Northern Nevada Muslim Community president\n\nThe issue of organ donation is one of the controversial topics in Islam and has been a subject of great debate among the scholars. Violating the human body is prohibited; however, saving a human life is as saving the life of all mankind (Quran 5:32). Thus most scholars are of the view that organ donation after one’s death is permissible. They also agree on the permissibility of donating organs during one’s lifetime as long as no harm is inflicted on the donor or impairment of an essential function in donor’s body is expected. For example, donating a kidney is allowed provided the donor has another healthy kidney. While organ donation is permissible, any financial gain for being an organ donor is strictly prohibited; Muslims are not allowed to sell their organs. It is noted that Muslims can donate and receive blood as well as other organs to and from non-Muslims.\n\nVISIBLE SIGN OF GOD’S WILL\n\nRobert W. Chorey, Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno curia moderator\n\nCatholic teaching supports organ donation as “an expression of generous solidarity” (Catechism of the Catholic Church 2296). It is a gift of ourselves for the benefit of others so that they can lead healthier, fuller lives. This reflects the will of God who desires that we truly have life, and have life in abundance. We can help someone have restored sight or renewed vigor; we can help a person have more time to love those in their life and make those deep connections. What a remarkable gift to give.\n\nThat being said, the donor must be willing and must consent to this. Therefore full communication of the donor and the family needs to be in place. We must talk now if we want to be donors; let our loved ones know this, so that when the moment of our physical death occurs, the gift of our organs can be given.\n\nINTERREFLECTION OF BEING\n\nMatthew T. Fisher, Reno Buddhist Center resident priest\n\nThe Buddha uses Wisdom and Compassion to relieve the suffering of all sentient beings. Sharing organs with another is a selfless act of compassion – Life living Itself. The Flower Garland Sutra describes Indra’s Net and teaches about myriad links between all beings in the universe: “Each shining jewel reflecting every other jewel in an infinite net of interreflection.” Organ donation is an expression of the Oneness – a selfless act of giving encouraged in a wise and compassionate society.\n\nIn the Jataka stories of the Buddha’s previous lives, he often gave of his own body to save another - like the famous story of the Rabbit in the Moon. The little rabbit is willing to sacrifice himself to save his friends. For this grand gesture the little rabbit’s image was emblazoned on the full moon. You can see it there even now.\n\nPERSONAL DECISION\n\nSharla S. Hales, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints area public affairs director\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has not taken an official position on organ donation. The Church Handbook states: “The donation of organs and tissues is a selfless act that often results in great benefit to individuals with medical conditions.” It continues by explaining that the decision to donate organs should be made by the individuals involved. As is the case with other medical decisions, a decision to receive a donated organ should be made after receiving competent medical advice and confirmation through prayer (Handbook 2, paragraph 21.3.7).\n\nOrgan transplantation does not affect resurrection, since the organs would just return to the elements of the earth soon after death anyway. Either way, the promise of resurrection remains: “Every limb and joint shall be restored to its body, yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost” (Alma 40:23).\n\nA KIDNEY FOR MOUSE\n\nBrian E. Melendez, American Indian spirituality scholar\n\nFrom a tribal perspective, we as tribal people tend to take pride in our extreme resourcefulness. When it comes to MacGyvering pretty much anything in nature to survive, indigenous groups found use and purpose for every stick, bone, or fur … taking only what was necessary and leaving nothing to waste!\n\nI’d like to believe if native people could swap out damaged or defective parts for better ones, I’m sure they probably would. Look at it this way, everything has spirit — an entire existence of foreign spirits entering our bodies — I know a guy who could use a kidney if you don’t want it! Save Jerry Mouse!\n\nThe will to survive is necessary when you are healthy, but even more critical when you are not. We all have loved ones that may require spare parts, and if someone doesn’t break bread, you might have to. Organ donation saves lives and is practical.\n\nNext week’s topic:\n\nWhat should be the guiding principle for the faithful — conscience or rules?\n\nFaith Forum is a weekly dialogue on religion produced by religious statesman Rajan Zed.
