        "text": "For a decade and a half, Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson has been the friendly face and voice of Africa in the Vatican Curia. First he was president of the \"Iustitia et pax\" Council, then he became prefect of the newly created development agency; and for just over a year Turkson has been president of the renowned Pontifical Academies of Science. He turns 75 on Wednesday.\n\nAs the Vatican's \"Minister of Social Affairs\", Turkson had to update Catholic social teaching - and shed ecclesiastical light on major human issues: Justice and peace, development and social progress, human rights and religious freedom, humanitarian aid, environmental protection and the climate crisis. To this end, its office prepares dossiers and statements for the inner-church space as well as for the social discourse. It organises high-profile congresses on a wide range of topics: nuclear disarmament, abolition of the death penalty, fair health care or the human right to drinking water.\n\nParish representation in Bavaria\n\nIn addition, the cardinal, who speaks five languages - in the late 1970s he also represented a parish in Illertissen, Bavaria - had to travel a lot. He represented the Holy See at international conferences, addressed the UN in New York, spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos and at German Catholic Days. In addition, the Pope repeatedly sent him as a mediator to war and crisis zones: to the Ivory Coast, Ukraine, the Ebola regions in eastern Congo.\n\nIn Rome, the always level-headed churchman was a sought-after interlocutor. The Ministry of Social Affairs is also considered an unofficial Vatican foreign ministry - for top politicians and church leaders, but also for people who do not (yet) want to get in touch with the Secretariat of State.\n\nLike many of Africa's bishops, Turkson has a Roman past. The son of a Catholic carpenter and a Methodist saleswoman, he studied in his native Ghana, at the Biblicum in Rome and in New York. After years as a professor, he became Bishop of Cape Coast at the age of 44. A year later, he took part in the first Africa Synod in Rome in 1994 - and later several times in world bishops' meetings.\n\nNevertheless, Turkson's elevation to cardinal in 2003 - he is the first from Ghana - was a surprise; also because Pope John Paul II passed over the head pastor of the capital Accra in the process. Benedict XVI then made Turkson \"Minister of Social Affairs\" and President of \"Iustitia et pax\". Pope Francis confirmed Turkson - who was by all means considered \"papable\" before the 2013 conclave - in this office. He became a key collaborator on Francis' great encyclicals\"Laudato si\" and \"Fratelli tutti\" - for environmental and climate protection and fraternity.\n\nThe reorganisation faltered\n\nWhen in 2016, in the course of the Curia reform, the four social agencies were dissolved and reorganised in the \"Dicastery for the Integral Development of the Human Being\", he promoted Turkson to the first prefect. A Herculean task. And: Turkson's strengths include content and pastoral care rather than administrative and management competence. There was a hitch in the reorganisation.\n\nAn additional burden came from a delicate personnel situation. Pope Francis, who is concerned about migrants, made the head of the department responsible for this, Turkson's undersecretary Michel Czerny, a cardinal in 2019 - thus putting him on the same level as the prefect. A conflict was pre-programmed. A visitation carried out in the summer of 2021 had identified serious leadership deficiencies in the authority, it was said. There was no extension for Turkson from the Pope at the end of his five-year term.\n\nHowever, Turkson was given an honourable follow-up task: as chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences as well as that of the Social Sciences; two think tanks, also staffed with Nobel Prize winners, which advise the Pope on scientific and socio-ethical issues. This gives the cardinal the opportunity to further explore future issues for the earth and humanity in an interdisciplinary exchange: from climate research to combating covid, from organ trade to the food crisis."
