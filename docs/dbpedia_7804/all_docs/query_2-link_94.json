        "text": "The Roman Curia is the administrative apparatus of the Holy See and the central governing body of the entire Roman Catholic Church, together with the Pope.[1] It coordinates and provides the necessary central organization for the correct functioning of the Church and the achievement of its goals.\n\n\"In exercising supreme, full, and immediate power in the universal Church, the Roman pontiff makes use of the departments of the Roman Curia which, therefore, perform their duties in his name and with his authority for the good of the churches and in the service of the sacred pastors\"[2]\n\n– Decree concerning the Pastoral Office of Bishops in the Church, Christus Dominus\n\nCuria in medieval and later Latin usage means \"court\" in the sense of \"royal court\" rather than \"court of law\". The Roman Curia, then, sometimes anglicized as the Court of Rome, as in the 1534 Act of the English Parliament that forbade appeals to it from England,[3] is the Papal Court, and assists the Pope in carrying out his functions. The Roman Curia can be loosely compared to cabinets in governments of countries with a Western form of governance, but only the Second Section of the Secretariat of State, known also as the Section for Relations with States, and the Congregation for Catholic Education, can be directly compared with specific ministries of a civil government.\n\nIt is normal for every Latin Catholic diocese to have its own curia for its administration. For the Diocese of Rome, these functions are not handled by the Roman Curia, but by the Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome, as provided by the Apostolic Constitution Ecclesia in Urbe. The Vicar General of Rome, traditionally a Cardinal, and his deputy the Vicegerent, who holds the personal title of Archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world.\n\nUntil recently, there still existed hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the Papal States were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by Pope Pius X, was incorporated into the Code of Canon Law (promulgated 1917). Further steps toward reorganization were begun by Pope Paul VI in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the second Code of Canon Law (1983).[4]\n\nThe offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the Holy See.\n\nThe following organs or charges, according to the official website of the Holy See, compose the Curia:[5]\n\nThe Secretariat of State[]\n\nThe Secretariat of State is the oldest dicastery in the Roman Curia, the government of the Roman Catholic Church. It is headed by the Cardinal Secretary of State, currently Tarcisio Bertone, and performs all the political and diplomatic functions of Vatican City and the Holy See. The Secretariat is divided into two sections, the Section for General Affairs and the Section for Relations with States, known as the First Section and Second Section, respectively. The Secretariat of State was created in the 15th century[6] and is now the dicastery most involved in coordination of the Holy See's activities.\n\nThe Congregations[]\n\nThe Roman Congregations[7] are a type of dicastery (department with a jurisdiction) of the Roman Curia, the central administrative organism of the Catholic Church. Each Congregation is led by a prefect, who is a Cardinal. Until recently, a non-cardinal appointed to head a congregation was styled as pro-prefect until he was made cardinal in a consistory. This practice has recently been abandoned.\n\nThe Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith[]\n\nThe Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith[8](CDF) (Congregatio pro Doctrina Fidei), previously known as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, and sometimes simply called the Holy Office is the oldest of the nine congregations of the Roman Curia. Among the most active of these major Curial departments, it oversees Catholic doctrine. The CDF is the modern name for what used to be the Holy Office of the Inquisition.\n\nCardinal William Joseph Levada is the Prefect.\n\nThe Congregation for the Oriental Churches[]\n\nThe Congregation for the Oriental Churches[9] (Congregatio pro Ecclesiis Orientalibus) is the congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for contact with the Eastern Catholic Churches for the sake of assisting their development, protecting their rights and also maintaining whole and entire in the one Catholic Church, alongside the liturgical, disciplinary and spiritual patrimony of the Latin Rite, the heritage of the various Oriental Christian traditions. It has exclusive authority over the following regions: Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula, Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, southern Albania and Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, and Ukraine.\n\nThe Congregation for the Oriental Churches has its origins in the \"Congregatio de Propaganda Fide pro negotiis ritus orientalis\" founded by Pope Pius IX on January 6, 1862. Included in the Congregation's membership are all Eastern Catholic patriarchs and major archbishops, as well as the President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.[10] It was formally set up by Pope Benedict XV on 1 May 1917. The title of Prefect was held by the Popes from 1917 until 1967, with the head of the Congregation titled as Secretary.\n\nThe Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments[]\n\nThe Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments[11](Congregatio de Cultu Divino et Disciplina Sacramentorum) is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Catholic Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments.\n\nCardinal Antonio Canizares Llovera is the Cardinal Prefect, Cardinal Francis Arinze is Prefect Emeritus, Archbishop Augustine DiNoia, O.P. [12] is the Secretary, Archbishop Malcolm Ranjith Patabendige Don is Secretary Emeritus, and Father Anthony Ward, S.M., is Under-secretary.\n\nIt is the direct successor of the Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments (Sacra Congregatio de Disciplina Sacramentorum) (1908-1969).\n\nThe Congregation for the Causes of Saints[]\n\nThe Congregation for the Causes of Saints[13] (Congregatio de Causis Sanctorum) is the congregation of the Roman Curia which oversees the complex process which leads to the canonization of saints, passing through the steps of a declaration of \"heroic virtues\" and beatification. After preparing a case, including the approval of miracles, the case is presented to the pope, who decides whether or not to proceed with beatification or canonization.\n\nThe predecessor of the congregation was the Sacred Congregation for Rites, founded by Pope Sixtus V on 22 January 1588 in the Bull Immensa Aeterni Dei. The congregation dealt both with regulating divine worship, and the causes of saints.\n\nOn 8 May 1969, Pope Paul VI issued the Apostolic Constitution Sacra Rituum Congregatio, dividing it into two congregations, the Congregation for the Divine Worship and one for the causes of saints. The latter was given three offices, those of the judiciary, the Promoter General of the Faith and the historical-juridical.\n\nWith the changes in the canonization process introduced by Pope John Paul II in 1983, a College of Relators was added to prepare the cases of those declared as Servants of God.\n\nSince 9 July 2009, the Prefect is Archbishop Angelo Amato, while the current secretary (appointed 5 May 2007) is Archbishop Michele Di Ruberto.\n\nThe Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples[]\n\nThe Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples[15] (Congregatio pro Gentium Evangelisatione) is the congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for missionary work and related activities. It is perhaps better known by its former title, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide). Renamed by Pope John Paul II in 1982, its mission continues unbroken. The modern term \"propaganda\" derives from the name of the Congregation and its mission; the word did not acquire negative connotations until the nationalistic propaganda campaigns of World War I.\n\nThe Sacred Congregation for the Clergy[]\n\nThe Congregation for the Clergy[16] is the congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for overseeing matters regarding priests and deacons not belonging to religious orders. The prefect is Cláudio Cardinal Hummes, and the secretary is Archbishop Mauro Piacenza. The Congregation for the Clergy handles requests for dispensation from active priestly ministry, as well as the legislation governing presbyteral councils and other organisations of priests around the world. The Congregation does not deal with clerical sexual abuse cases, as those are handled exclusively by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\nThe Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life[]\n\nThe Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life[17](Congregatio pro Institutis Vitae Consecratae et Societatibus Vitae Apostolicae) is the congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for everything which concerns institutes of consecrated life (orders and religious congregations, both of men and of women, secular institutes) and Society of Apostolic Life regarding their government, discipline, studies, goods, rights, and privileges.\n\nThe Congregation for Catholic Education (in Seminaries and Institutes of Study)[]\n\nThe Congregation for Catholic Education[18] (for Seminaries and Educational Institutions)(Congregatio de Institutione Catholica (de Seminariis atque Studiorum Institutis)) is the Pontifical congregation of the Roman Curia responsible for:\n\nseminaries (except those regulated by the Congregations for the Evangelization of Peoples and for the Oriental Churches) and houses of formation of religious and secular institutes;\n\nuniversities, faculties, institutes and higher schools of study, either ecclesial or civil dependent on ecclesial persons; and\n\nschools and educational institutes depending on ecclesiastical authorities.\n\nThe Congregation for Bishops[]\n\nThe Congregation for Bishops[19] (Congregatio pro Episcopis) is the congregation of the Roman Curia which oversees the selection of new bishops that are not in mission territories or those areas that come under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Oriental Chuches who deal with the Eastern Catholics, pending papal approval. It also schedules the papal audiences required quinquennially for bishops and arranges the creation of new dioceses.\n\nThe Tribunals[]\n\nThe Tribunals[20] of the Curia are three: the Sacred Apostolic Penitentiaria, the Sacred Roman Rota, and the Apostolic Signatura.\n\nThe Apostolic Penitentiary[]\n\nThe Apostolic Penitentiary,[21] more formally the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Penitentiary, is one of the three tribunals of the Roman Curia. The Apostolic Penitentiary is chiefly a tribunal of mercy, responsible for issues relating to the forgiveness of sins in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe Apostolic Penitentiary has jurisdiction only over matters in the internal forum. Its work falls mainly into these categories:\n\nthe absolution of excommunications latæ sententiæ reserved to the Holy See,\n\nthe dispensation of sacramental impediments reserved to the Holy See, and\n\nthe issuance and governance of indulgences.\n\nThe Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura[]\n\nThe Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura[22] is the highest judicial authority in the Catholic Church besides the Pope himself, who is the supreme ecclesiastical judge. In addition, it is an administrative office for matters pertaining to the judicial activity of the whole Church.\n\nAppeals in standard judicial processes, if appealed to the Apostolic See, normally are not handled by the Signatura. Those go to the Roman Rota, which is the ordinary appellate tribunal of the Apostolic See. The Supreme Tribunal handles some of the more specialized kinds of cases, including the following:\n\nPetitions for a declaration of nullity against a Rotal decision;\n\nConflicts of jurisdiction between two or more tribunals or dicasteries,\n\nRecourse against administrative acts of ordinaries and dicasteries (including some penal cases decided without using a court),\n\nAlthough a Rotal decision can be appealed, if not res judicata, to a different panel (turnus) of the Rota, there is no right of appeal from the decision of the Signatura (CIC, c. 1629, §1).\n\nAs an administrative office, it exercises jurisdiction (vigilance) over all the tribunals of the Catholic Church. It can also extend the jurisdiction of tribunals, grant dispensations for procedural laws, establish interdiocesan tribunals, and correct advocates.\n\nThe Tribunal of the Rota Romana[]\n\nThe Tribunal of the Roman Rota is the highest appellate tribunal.[23] While usually trying cases in appeal in third instance (as is normally the case in the Eastern Catholic Churches),[24] or even in second instance if appeal is made to it directly from the sentence of a tribunal of first instance, it is also a court of first instance for cases specified in the law and for others committed to the Rota by the Roman Pontiff.[23][25] It fosters the unity of jurisprudence and, through its own sentences, is a help to lower tribunals.[23]\n\nThe greater Part of its decisions concern the nullity of marriage. In such cases its competence includes marriages between two Catholics, between a Catholic and non-Catholic, and between two non-Catholic parties whether one or both of the baptized parties belongs to the Latin or an Eastern Rite.[26]\n\nThe court is named Rota (Latin for: wheel) because the judges, called auditors, originally met in a round room to hear cases.[27]\n\nThe Pontifical Councils[]\n\nPart of a series on the Catholic Church Organization Pope – Pope Francis College of Cardinals Ecumenical Councils Episcopal polity · Latin Rite Eastern Catholic Churches Background History · Christianity Catholicism · Apostolic Succession Four Marks of the Church Ten Commandments Crucifixion & Resurrection of Jesus Ascension · Assumption of Mary Criticism of the Catholic Church Theology Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) Theology · Apologetics Divine Grace · Sacraments Purgatory · Salvation Original sin · Saints · Dogma Virgin Mary · Mariology Immaculate Conception of Mary Liturgy and Worship Roman Catholic Liturgy Eucharist · Liturgy of the Hours Liturgical Year · Biblical Canon Rites Roman · Armenian · Alexandrian Byzantine · Antiochian · East Syrian Catholicism topics Ecumenism · Monasticism Prayer · Music · Art Catholicism portal\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Laity[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Laity[28] has the responsibility of assisting the Pope in his dealings with the laity in lay ecclesial movements or individually, and their contributions to the Church. The President of the council is Archbishop Stanisław Cardinal Ryłko. Its secretary is Josef Clemens.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity[29] is a pontifical council of the Roman Curia dedicated chiefly to the promotion of dialogue and unity with other Christian churches and ecclesial communities, but also, through a closely linked specific commission, to advancing religious relations with Jews.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Family[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Family[30] is part of the Curia of the Roman Catholic Church. It was established by Pope John Paul II on May 9, 1981 with the Motu Proprio Familia a Deo Instituta and substituted for the Committee for the Family of Pope Paul VI, which had been established in 1973. The Council \"promotes the pastoral care of families, protects their rights and dignity in the Church and in civil society, so that they may ever be more able to fulfill their duties.\"[31]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace [32] is a part of the Roman Curia dedicated to \"action-oriented studies\" for the international promotion of justice, peace, and human rights from the perspective of the Roman Catholic Church. To this end, it cooperates with various religious orders and advocacy groups, as well as scholarly, ecumenical, and international organizations.\n\nThe Pontifical Council Cor Unum[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council Cor Unum [33] for Human and Christian Development is part of the Curia of the Catholic Church. It was established by Pope Paul VI on 15 July 1971 and is based in the Palazzo San Callisto, in Piazza San Callisto, Rome. Its mission is \"the care of the Catholic Church for the needy, thereby encouraging human fellowship and making manifest the charity of Christ\", and it undertakes this mission by carrying out humanitarian relief operations following disasters, fostering charity, and encouraging cooperation and coordination of other Catholic organizations.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants[34] (Pontificium Consilium de Spirituali Migrantium atque Itinerantium Cura) is a dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Council, established by Pope John Paul II on June 28, 1988, is dedicated to the spiritual welfare of migrant and itinerant people.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers [35] was set up by the Motu Proprio Dolentium Hominum of 11 February 1985, by Pope John Paul II who reformed the Pontifical Commission for the Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers into its present form in 1988. It is part of the Roman Curia with Archbishop Zygmunt Zimowski as its President. The apostolic constitution Pastor Bonus describes the work of the council as\n\nArt. 152 — The Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers shows the solicitude of the Church for the sick by helping those who serve the sick and suffering, so that their apostolate of mercy may ever more effectively respond to people’s needs.\n\nArt. 153 — § 1. The Council is to spread the Church’s teaching on the spiritual and moral aspects of illness as well as the meaning of human suffering [1].\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts [36] is part of the Roman Curia. Its work \"consists mainly in interpreting the laws of the Church\". (Pastor Bonus, 154). Its President is currently Archbishop Francesco Coccopalmerio, while Julián Cardinal Herranz Casado holds the position of President Emeritus. The current Vice-President is Bruno Bertagna.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue [37] is the central office of the Catholic Church for the promotion of interreligious dialogue in accordance with the spirit of the Second Vatican Council, in particular the declaration Nostra Aetate. It has the following responsibilities:\n\nto promote mutual understanding, respect and collaboration between Catholics and the followers of others religious traditions;\n\nto encourage the study of religions;\n\nto promote the formation of persons dedicated to dialogue.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Culture[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Culture[38] (Latin: Pontificium Consilium de Cultura) is a Pontifical Council of the Roman Catholic Church with a mission to oversee the relationship of the Catholic Church with different cultures. The Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers was merged with the Pontifical Council for Culture in 1993.\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Social Communications[]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Social Communications [39](Pontificium Consilium de Communicationibus Socialibus) is a dicastery of the Roman Curia. Established by Pope John Paul II on June 28, 1988, it is responsible for using the various forms of the media in spreading the Gospel.\n\nThe Synod of Bishops[]\n\nThe Synod of Bishops[40] is an innovation from the Second Vatican Council, introduced by the decree Christus Dominus. It is an advisory body of the Pope, whose members are elected by bishops from around the world. The Pope serves as its president or appoints its president, determines its agenda, summons, suspends, and dissolves the synod, and can also appoint additional members to it (can. 344). Members of the synod express their opinions on matters on an individual basis (i.e. no decrees or resolutions are issued by the synod), but the Pope, at his option, can grant it that power, in which case its decrees or resolutions are approved and promulgated by him alone (can. 343). The Synod of Bishops is suspended when the Holy See is vacant.\n\nThe Offices[]\n\nThe Holy See's financial authorities are made up of three Offices.\n\nThe Apostolic Camera[]\n\nThe Apostolic Camera,[41] or in Latin (Reverenda) Camera Apostolica or Apostolica Camera, is the central board of finance in the Papal administrative system, which at one time was of great importance in the government of the States of the Church, and in the administration of justice, led by the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church.\n\nThe Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See[]\n\nThe Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See[42] is part of the Roman Curia that deals with the \"properties owned by the Holy See in order to provide the funds necessary for the Roman Curia to function\". (Pastor Bonus, 172). It was established by Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1967. Its current President is Cardinal Attilio Nicora since 1 October 2002. Cardinals Lorenzo Antonetti and Agostino Cacciavillan are former Presidents.\n\nIt is composed of two sections. The Ordinary Section continues the work of the Administration of the Property of the Holy See, a commission to which Pope Leo XIII entrusted the administration of the property remaining to the Holy See after the complete loss of the Papal States in 1870. The Extraordinary Section administers the funds given by the Italian government to implement the Financial Convention attached to the Lateran Treaty of 1929.
