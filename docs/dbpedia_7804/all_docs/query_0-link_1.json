The General Curia community is a community like any other community around the world. We live, work and pray together.\n\nWe Jesuits are friends in the Lord, and in community life, we seek to support one another through our companionship. Community life is an important dimension of our Jesuit identity as well as an integral and fundamental element of the Jesuit mission. In our common and shared life together, we try to actualise the spirit of General Congregation 36, which declared that,"
