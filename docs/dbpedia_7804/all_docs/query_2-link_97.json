        "text": "This article is about the Roman Curia of the Holy See. For a governing body of a particular church, see Curia (Roman Catholic Church). For the building that housed the Roman Senate, see Curia Julia. For other Roman curiae, see Curia.\n\nThe Roman Curia (Latin: Romana Curia) comprises the administrative institutions of the Holy See[note 1] and the central body through which the affairs of the Roman Catholic Church are conducted. The Roman Curia is the institution which the Roman Pontiff ordinarily makes use of in the exercise of his supreme pastoral office and universal mission in the world. It is at the service of the Pope, successor of Peter, and of the Bishops, successors of the Apostles, according to the modalities that are proper to the nature of each one, fulfilling their function with an evangelical spirit, working for the good and at the service of communion, unity and edification of the Universal Church and attending to the demands of the world in which the Church is called to fulfill its mission (Praedicate evangelium, article 1).[1]\n\nThe structure and organization of responsibilities within the Curia are at present regulated by the apostolic constitution, Praedicate evangelium issued by Pope Francis on 19 March 2022, which was completely enforced on 5 June 2022. It was previously regulated by Pastor bonus issued by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988.[2] With the coming into force of Praedicate evangelium, the Pastor bonus is fully abrogated and replaced, and the reform of the Roman Curia is thus completed."
