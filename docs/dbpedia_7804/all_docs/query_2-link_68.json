Cookies may contain information about searches made on a particular web server and information that is stored on the server. The primary purpose of using cookies is to store user profile information, which primarily saves the user's preferred settings, so that the user can access the web site in the usual manner.\n\nCookies are stored in a separate directory by the browser program on the devices used by the Data subject (computer, tablet, smart phone, etc.).
