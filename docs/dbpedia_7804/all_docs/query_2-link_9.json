        "text": "The Roman Curia - usually (though inaccurately) called the Vatican - is the administrative apparatus of the Holy See, coordinating and providing the necessary organisation for the correct functioning of the Roman Catholic Church and the achievement of its goals. It is generally considered as representing the international government of the Catholic Church.\n\nCuria in medieval and later Latin usage means \"court\" in the sense of \"royal court\" rather than \"court of law\" (though those two meanings are related in history). The Roman Curia, then, sometimes anglicized as Roman Court, is the Papal Court, and assists the Pope in carrying out his functions.\n\nPurpose[]\n\nIn exercising supreme, full, and immediate power in the universal Church, the Roman pontiff makes use of the departments of the Roman Curia which, therefore, perform their duties in his name and with his authority for the good of the churches and in the service of the sacred pastors.Christus Dominus\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Roman Curia was originally established in the 16th Century by Pope Sixtus V and had both religious and civil functions, though the latter were greatly transformed in the 19th century when the expansion of the Piedmontese State to include the greater part of Italy included the seizure of most of the Papal States in 1860 and the city of Rome itself in 1870, and hence effectively ended much of the Papacy's temporal power. An agreement was reached on this issue when in 1929 the Holy See concluded the Lateran Treaties with the Italian State, which had since 1919 occupied the whole of the peninsula, plus Sicily and Sardinia. By this act, the Roman Curia gave up any claim to an administrative role in the defunct Papal States, though it has such with regard to the successor Vatican City State. In practice, the Curia is now mainly dedicated to the support of the Pope's ecclesiastical responsibilities.\n\nIn its long and eventful history, it underwent numerous organisational changes. Among its former components are:\n\nthree of the former five so-called offices: Apostolic Chancery; Apostolic Dataria; Secretariate of Briefs\n\nvarious former Roman Congregations\n\nStructure[]\n\nThe following organs or charges, according to the official website of the Holy See ([1]), compose the Curia:\n\nThe Secretariat of State - created in the 15th century, it is now the dicastery most involved in coordination of the Holy See's activities [2]. It is headed by the Cardinal Secretary of State.\n\nSection for General Affairs\n\nSection for Relations with States\n\nThe Roman Congregations [3] -\n\nThe Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (once the Sacred Congregation of the Universal Inquisition, later Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office) ([4]),\n\nThe Congregation for the Oriental Churches [5] (once the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide pro negotiis ritus orientalis)\n\nThe Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments [6]\n\nThe Congregation for the Causes of Saints [7]\n\nThe Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples [8] (better known as the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide)\n\nThe Congregation for the Clergy [9] (originated in the wake of the Council of Trent as Sacra Congregatio Cardinalium Concilii Tridentini Interpretum)\n\nThe Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life [10]\n\nThe Congregation for Catholic Education (for Seminaries and Educational Institutions) [11] (born as Congregatio pro universitate studii romani, then Congregatio de Seminariis et Studiorum Universitatibus)\n\nThe Congregation for Bishops (Congregatio pro Episcopis)\n\nThe Tribunals\n\nThe Apostolic Penitentiary\n\nThe Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura\n\nThe Sacra Rota Romana\n\nThe Pontifical Councils[12]\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Laity\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Family\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace\n\nThe Pontifical Council Cor Unum\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants\n\nThe Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Workers\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Culture\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Social Communications\n\nThe Synod of Bishops\n\nThe Offices\n\nThe Apostolic Chamber\n\nThe Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See\n\nThe Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See\n\nThe Prefecture for the Pontifical Household\n\nThe Office of the Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations\n\nThe Pontifical Commissions [13]\n\nThe Pontifical Commission for the cultural heritage of the Church\n\nThe Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archeology\n\nThe Pontifical Biblical Commission\n\nThe Pontifical Commission for revision of the Vulgata\n\nThe International Theological Commission\n\nThe Pontifical Commission for International Eucharistic Congresses\n\nThe Pontifical Committee of Historical Sciences\n\nThe Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei\n\nThe Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State\n\nThe Pontifical Commission for Latin America\n\nThe Discipline Commission of the Roman Curia\n\nThe Swiss Guard [14] [15]\n\nThe Pontifical Academies [16]\n\nThe Labour office [17]\n\nOther institutions [18]\n\nIt should be noted that it is normal for every Latin Catholic diocese to have a curia in its administration. For the Diocese of Rome, these functions are not handled by the Roman Curia, but by the Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome, as provided by the Apostolic Constitution Ecclesia in Urbe. The Vicar General, traditionally a Cardinal, and his deputy the Vicegerent, who holds the personal title of Archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but no more dependence on the Roman Curia as such than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world.\n\nSee also[]\n\nPolitics of the Vatican City\n\n[]\n\nThe Roman Curia by Giga-Catholic Information\n\nCatholic Encyclopaedia (not yet fully exploited)"
