        "text": "THE BILLIE IS ONE OF THE LAST REMAINING THEATERS FORGED IN THE AESTHETIC AND SOCIOCULTURAL KILN OF AMERICA’S CIVIL RIGHTS/BLACK ARTS MOVEMENTS.\n\nThe Obie, AUDELCO, and National Medal for the Arts award-winning Billie Holiday Theatre is a state-of-the-art creative campus located at Restoration Plaza in the historic Black cultural mecca of Bedford Stuyvesant, home to such artistic luminaries as Lena Horne, Max Roach, Eubie Blake, Stepahnie Mills, Ben Vereen, Jay Z, Yasiin Bey, and more and the only multi-platform performing arts center with a 22-year old education program led by, for, and accountable to people of African descent in the heart of the largest African American community in the nation: Central Brooklyn. For 50 years, The Billie has elevated and promoted the critical voices of Black artists, and the stories of the complex journey toward freedom for people of African descent, a journey that is far from over.\n\nHISTORY\n\nIn 1981, BHT made history when it transferred the hit play Inacent Black to Broadway with fifty percent of the financing being derived from the Black community; a first in the theatre world (as cited in The New York Times), and unheard of prior to Inacent Black.\n\nMany of today’s successful actors, writers, designers, and musicians developed their craft at The Billie Holiday Theatre. Actors such as Samuel L. Jackson, Debbie Allen, Tichina Arnold, Bill Cobbs, Phyllis Yvonne Stickney, Carol Woods, Elaine Graham and Ebony JoAnn to name but a few.\n\nThe legendary William “Smokey” Robinson had his first musical, Raisin’ Hell, produced at BHT, while other notable authors whose debut plays were produced at BHT include: Samm Art Williams, legendary jazz musician Weldon Irvine, and John Henry Redwood (The Old Settler).\n\nMISSION\n\nThe goal of the Billie Holiday Theatre is to provide audiences with complete and authentic portrayals of the experiences of people of African descent across the world. To provide artists of African descent pure and unapologetic artistic freedom. We do this by producing and presenting all forms of art, and by challenging unjust systems that would prevent artists, institutions, and communities full access to world-class arts, creative spaces, and resources.\n\n“So much of what makes this country rich in art and all manners of spiritual life is the contributions that we as African Americans have made. To give expression to the spirit that has been shaped and fashioned by our history is of necessity to give voice and vent to the history itself. It must remain for us a history of triumph.” – August Wilson\n\nThe Billie has rededicated itself to its mission with intentional programming and amplifying new voices. We look forward to welcoming you home with Y/Our Stories, Y/Our Truth, Y/Our Theater to The Billie."
