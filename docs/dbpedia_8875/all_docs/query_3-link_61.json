        "text": "Each week, Val Haller, a music-obsessed baby boomer and the founder of the Web site Valslist.com, matches tracks from her generation to those of her 20-something sons’ generation.\n\nThe dinner party. The guest list: check. Invitations: check. Menu: check. Bar stocked: check. Music: uh ...\n\nMusic often causes last-minute panic when entertaining. I know this because I’m usually on the receiving end of frantic calls from friends asking to borrow my iPod with dinner-party playlists. This week’s paired artists are always welcome guests at my dinner parties. Their silken blend of jazz and vocals provides a smooth undercurrent on which conversation can ride. Whom do you invite to your dinner party?\n\nBILLIE HOLIDAY\n\nBorn Eleanor Fagan in 1915, Billie Holiday had a life of extraordinary contrasts. On one hand: she grew up in brutal poverty, surviving bad relationships and racial cruelty. She was a teen-age prostitute, became a drug addict, battled poor health. On the other, she was one of the great celebrities of her time, an extraordinary talent, who collaborated with Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington and Count Basie. Her voice was as distinctive as the white gardenia she wore in her hair. Her big breakthrough came at age 20 when the jazz writer/producer John Hammond heard that voice. She was filling in for a better-known performer. He loved her slower tempo, husky blues vocals, her different rhythm. The saxophonist Lester Young and Holiday created some of the greatest jazz recordings of all time. She called him Prez; he called her Lady Day. As her music career took off, her emotional and physical health deteriorated. She was only 44 when she died. In the 1972 film “Lady Sings the Blues,” Diana Ross stars as Holiday. Rock band U2’s song “Angel of Harlem” is a tribute to Holiday. But really, the best way to get close to Holiday is to listen to her."
