        "text": "Jazz legend Billie Holiday – born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915 in Philadelphia - is widely considered to have one of the greatest jazz voices of all time.\n\nTune in today and tomorrow as we share some of Billie Holiday’s most notable recordings throughout the day to celebrate the centennial of her birth! And don’t miss Jazz Night In America’s tribute to Holiday – featuring Cassandra Wilson performing her take on the classics sung by “Lady Day” herself.\n\nHoliday made her singing debut in obscure Harlem nightclubs and borrowed her professional name – Billie Holiday – from screen star Billie Dove. Although she never had any technical training or learned how to read music, Holiday quickly became a part of what was then one of the most vibrant jazz scenes in the country.\n\nSpotted by John Hammond at the age of 18, Holiday cut her first record as part of a studio group led by Benny Goodman, who was then on the verge of public prominence.\n\nIn 1935 Holiday’s career got a big push when she recorded four hits – including “What a Little Moonlight Can Do” and “Miss Brown to You” - landing herself a recording contract of her own.\n\nHoliday began working with Lester Young in 1936, who pegged her with her now-famous nickname of “Lady Day.” When Holiday joined Count Basie in 1937 and then Artie Shaw in 1938, she became one of the first black women to work with a white orchestra.\n\nDuring this time, Holiday came across “Strange Fruit,” an emotional poem about the lynching of a black man. This poem inspired a song of the same title, which became one of Holiday’s classics and prompted Lady Day to continue recording more of her signature, moving ballads.\n\nHoliday’s unique diction, inimitable phrasing, and acute dramatic intensity made her the outstanding jazz singer of her day.\n\n“Singing songs like the ‘The Man I Love’ or ‘Porgy’ is no more work than sitting down and eating Chinese roast duck, and I love roast duck,” she wrote in her autobiography. “I’ve lived songs like that.”\n\nA musical legend still popular today, Holiday died an untimely death at the age of 44. Her legacy lives on in her recordings, which became an important building block of early American jazz music.\n\nA social phenomenon of the 1950s, Holiday’s trademark was wearing white gardenias in her hair.\n\nHoliday’s soulful, unique singing voice and ability to boldly turn any material she confronted into her own music made her a superstar of her time. Today, Holiday is remembered for her masterpieces, creativity and vivacity.\n\nMany of Holiday’s songs are as well known today as they were decades ago. Lady Day’s poignant voice is still considered to be one of the greatest jazz voices of all time.\n\nTune in today and tomorrow as we share some of Billie Holiday’s most notable recordings throughout the day! And don’t miss Jazz Night In America’s tribute to Holiday – featuring Cassandra Wilson performing her take on the classics sung by “Lady Day” herself.\n\nWatch video of Billie Holiday’s best loved performances here."
