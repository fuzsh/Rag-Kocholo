        "text": "Transcript\n\nBillie Holiday was one of the foremost American jazz singers in the mid-20th century.\n\nHoliday was born on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as Elinore Harris.\n\nShe later adopted the surname of her father, Clarence Holiday, and took the name Billie from her favourite film actress, Billie Dove.\n\nThough Holiday never had any formal training, she had an instinctive sense of musical structure and a unique singing style.\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1950s, Holiday performed in cabarets and concert halls, worked with other jazz musicians, recorded music, and toured across the United States.\n\nShe was nicknamed “Lady Day” by saxophonist Lester Young, one of her frequent collaborators.\n\nOne of Billie Holiday’s most famous songs was “Strange Fruit,” which was adapted into a song by writer and composer Abel Meeropol from a poem he had written.\n\nIt was a lyrical protest of lynching—violence enacted by white mobs against Black Americans.\n\nThough government officials found the song divisive and warned Holiday to stop singing it, she refused. With great dramatic effect and resonance, she would often sing “Strange Fruit” at the end of her performances and quickly leave the stage when the lights went down.\n\nBillie Holiday died on July 17, 1959, after a long struggle with drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n“If I’m going to sing like someone else, then I don’t need to sing at all.” —Billie Holiday"
