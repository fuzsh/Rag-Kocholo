        "text": "Billie Holiday is captured live at Storyville in Boston in 1951 and 1953. The discreet recordings capture Lady Day in prime emotive voice. On most selections she is accompanied by the Carl Drinkard Trio, but six others find her joined by Buster Hardingâ€™s Trio; the great tenor Stan Getz sits in on three of these numbers. Previously out of press for over 25 years, this historic recording has now been remastered and pressed on audiophile-grade vinyl at Pallas Group in Germany.\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1 I Cover The Waterfront\n\nA2 Too Marvelous For Words\n\nA3 I Love You Porgy\n\nA4 Them There Eyes\n\nA5 Willow Weep For Me\n\nA6 I Only Have Eyes For You\n\nA7 You Go To My Head\n\nB1 He's Funny That Way\n\nB2 Billie Blues\n\nB3 Miss Brown To You\n\nB4 Lover Come Back To Me\n\nB5 Ain't Nobody's Business If I Do\n\nB6 You're Driving Me Crazy"
