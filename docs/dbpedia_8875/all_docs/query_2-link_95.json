(See below for a video.)\n\nShe had a very difficult childhood, but not much is known about it. Nobody’s even sure who her father was! However she chose her surname to be that of the man most likely to be her father, Clarence Holiday.\n\nShe also had a very difficult life as a adult. She was treated badly by many men.\n\nShe was quite ill in the last years of her life. Because of this her voice didn’t sound as good as it once had. However, her late recordings are still great because she put so much more emotion into her singing.\n\nUnfortunately she was in trouble with the police a lot. In fact she was arrested as she lay dying in hospital.\n\nOfficial Website\n\nHere is a video of Billie Holiday singing The Blues are Brewin’ (with Louis Armstrong on the trumpet).\n\nBillie Holliday singing ‘The Blues are Brewin”\n\nAnd here is a video of Billie Holiday singing My Man.\n\nBillie Holiday singing ‘My Man’\n\nPicture credits:\n\nBillie Holiday.
