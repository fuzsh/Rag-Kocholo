        "text": "Billie Holiday was a legendary American singer, songwriter and social phenomenon whose soulful, unique singing voice, introspective songwriting, as well as her ability to boldly turn any material that she confronted into her own, made her a superstar of her time and decades beyond.\n\nConsidered to be one of the greatest jazz voices of all time, Holidayâ€™s intense, emotive, highly stylized and endlessly nuanced vocal style has become one of the most imitated. She changed and revolutionized the art of traditional pop vocal music forever."
