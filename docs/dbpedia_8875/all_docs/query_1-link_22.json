        "text": "Since Billie Holiday's death in 1959, an image of her has emerged based mainly on the movies Lady Sings the Blues and The United States versus Billie Holiday. In these depictions of her, she is an in-the-gutter heroin addict who is so helpless she must be rescued from herself by the men in her life. In the end, she is a failure who died estranged from her last husband, strung out, and penniless.\n\nOver the years, I assumed the portrayal of Holiday as a powerless victim was true. However, when I started researching , I was shocked to learn there was an entirely different version of Holiday to be discovered.\n\nBillie Holiday, center, with Duke Ellington and Leonard Feather in 1945.\n\nIn this “new” version I was unearthing, Holiday did not consider herself a failure at all. In my book, I quote a friend of hers as saying, “What she really felt, the Rosebud to understanding her, was that her life was a triumph.” And it was a triumph.\n\nFor years, Holiday was a vital force in the entertainment industry. She worked with some of the most prominent members of her generation. She fraternized with socialites, fellow artists, and titans in the political and show business communities. She enjoyed such success because, like other notable figures of her time—Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes—she was a persona of her own creation. And in that version of her life, often splashed across the pages of newspapers and magazines, she was a beautiful, elegant woman, always clad in evening attire whether she was playing Carnegie Hall or a local nightclub, who became a singular figure in the world of popular music.\n\nBillie Holiday with clarinetist Tony Scott photographed at a small dinner party in his Upper West Side apartment in the final months of her life.\n\nThat was her professional life. Her private life was just as rewarding primarily because it was enriched by friendships that gave her emotional sustenance when her romantic involvements with violent men collapsed (as they always did). In the mid-1940s, she formed a friendship with Elizabeth Hardwick, the novelist and literary critic, that was so intense Hardwick later made her a character in her novel Sleepless Nights. When Holiday began her rise to fame in Harlem, she met Hazel Scott (their mothers were friends first), who would go on to become a virtuoso pianist whose career Holiday championed in part by recommending her to headline at Café Society. Another close friend was Leonard Feather, who originally wrote about Holiday in an early profile before he later produced her successful 1954 European tour and presented her in numerous additional events.\n\nBillie Holiday with jazz artist Hazel Scott and producer Leonard Feather, two of her closest friends. She often visited Feather and his family at their Manhattan apartment. She spent her final Thanksgiving at a festive celebration at Scott’s flat in Paris.\n\nA never-before-seen photograph of Holiday with Scott and Feather, which is included in my book (and shown here), captures the love she felt for her friends. Holiday leans back in laugher as Scott, smiling warmly, embraces her and Feather fondly looks on. Another unpublished photograph included in my book (also shown here) captures Holiday posing for the camera as she is admired devotedly by Tony Scott, the iconoclastic clarinetist who maintained a yearslong friendship with her. It was Scott, at the end of her life when Holiday could not finish her final appearance before an audience in May 1959, who stood in the wings as she abruptly left the stage and collapsed into his arms.\n\nThese newly revealed photographs show the real Billie Holiday, not a victim or a failure but a joyful woman who, with the support of her friends, was able to triumph over the tribulations of her life to become a consummate musical artist and, ultimately, an American icon."
