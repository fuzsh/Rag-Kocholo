        "text": "We had years of earth-cracking sunshine here on the North Coast so there were even more bossa nova, psych-pop, Cal Tjader, Motown, folk-rock, and jazz-funk records on the turntable than usual.\n\nWhen months of epic storms started to hit us I broke out my Sinatra and Lady Day albums again. Each artist offers perfect accompaniment when you are staring out of rain-splattered windows with a glass of whiskey in your hand. Come to think of it, each vocalist goes perfectly with any weather or life event, “Come Rain or Come Shine” as Johnny Mercer put it.\n\nBoth singers celebrated centennials in 2016 and were important parts of the other’s artistic lives (you can read more about the Sinatra-Lady Day mutual admiration society in this NYT’s article). They mastered a sublime marriage of musicianship and lyric interpreting, expressing the minutiae of emotional detail involved in the human condition. Their music helps us explain ourselves to ourselves.\n\nBillie Holiday’s earlier recordings, especially those with Lester Young, are rightfully celebrated but I find myself listening to her later Verve albums the most on record. For one thing, Verve specialized in putting out studio albums. They knew Holiday’s time as a potential singles hit-maker was long over and she should, instead, be part of the album age. Kids bought singles. Adults bought albums.\n\nVerve’s Norm Granz also knew how to make Lady Day feel comfortable in the studio while simultaneously disturbing her comfort zone by making her learn songs she hadn’t recorded before. Granz still had Holiday revisit some of her most famous songs but he had her concentrate on cutting dozens of truly great songs she had never laid down before (the majority of them were basically the Sinatra songbook). Finally, the bands backing her at Verve were just brilliant, recalling her best sides with Teddy Wilson and others while the advent of the LP allowed for longer running times on songs played at just the right tempo.\n\nOne Billie Holiday album in particular, Songs For Distingué Lovers, is on my shortlist of greatest albums of all-time but really, she has a great catalog. For some reason, when the deluge of rain hit, Solitude was my first pick. Maybe it just came down to the sleeve??\n\nThe cover\n\nI love this one.\n\nAs I mentioned in this Miles Davis write-up, there is a side conversation about white models being on the LP sleeves of black artists but that is a separate issue from the quality of the image. Plus, nobody was trying to keep Billie Holiday herself off of record sleeves. She was iconic after all and graced the majority of covers I could find in both the 10 and 12 inch LP eras. She’s not pictured on a couple of Verve sleeves but during the Bop era the label was known for creating visually appealing illustrated covers for most of their artists.\n\nWhat the Solitude cover does speak to is Billie Holiday’s changing place in the pop landscape and how her image, and music, was sold to audiences in the 1950s.\n\nDuring the most successful parts of her career Billie Holiday recorded for major record labels though some of her most revered recordings were done for Commodore, a boutique jazz label run by Billy Crystal’s family. From 1944-1950 Lady Day was on Decca, which was the biggest label of the time. She recorded reams of singles there and I highly recommend the LP collections built from them. Decca was trying to sell Billie Holiday as a pop star, during a time when jazz was still part of popular music.\n\nBy 1952, when Lady Day started recording for the indie labels that would become Verve Records her perceived potential as a singles hitmaker was over. She was now a revered cult artist who meant one thing to jazz musicians, their fans, and to urbane urbanites and something else completely to a tisk-tisking mass media and a wider general public. Billie Holiday’s personal struggles were well-known, the authorities were actively looking to bust her (and did). As a side note, the authorities were also looking to bust black artists who were not into drugs. Norman Granz very famously put his life on the line when he discovered Houston police planting narcotics in the clean-living Ella Fitzgerald’s dressing room.\n\nBillie Holiday became synonymous with misery. She was also very photogenic. Put that and misery together and you got something you can sell. Holiday herself bit the misery bullet in 1956 with a celebrity memoir that told plenty of sad tales during an era when celebrities kept things to themselves.\n\nSo, with Solitude and other titles, Verve was selling the Billie Holiday mystique, a way for music fans to buy some instant, downbeat authenticity while clutching at a sonic teddy bear to try and soothe their own troubled souls. Take a peak at her various Verve album sleeves along with Solitude and it seems like the label was marketing Billie Holiday records as aural anti-depressives for bomb-blasted American city-dwellers who were hiding anxiety disorders, unfulfilled dreams, and an increasing reliance on alcohol. Sinatra actually did the same thing but he juggled his theme albums between ones that plumb the depths of wrist-slashing loss that actually go darker than Billie Holiday’s LP’s and ones that explore euphoric highs.\n\nWhat a cornucopia of misery!\n\nBut, an artist’s image and their actual music can be different. Solitude has a few torch songs on it but its not a set of unrelenting downers that its cover would suggest; it’s not even a straight ballad record, though it leans on ballads. Billie Holiday’s catalog, and her approach to songs, is more emotionally positive, and nuanced, than her image. There are definitely rain clouds in her songs but also plenty of light streaking through them.\n\nThe music.\n\nFirst off, while Solitude plays like a complete album its actually made up of the very first sessions Billie Holiday cut in 1952 for Clef, which would become Verve. Many of the songs on the album were originally released on a 10′ record in 1952 and then expanded in ’56 at the start of the 12′ LP era. Amazingly, this was Billie Holiday’s very first album that wasn’t compiled from singles. Geez, she had been a major star for a couple of decades!\n\nProducer Granz tapped Oscar Peterson to accompany Holiday and surrounded her with some new friends. At Verve, Granz blueprinted mainstream jazz, the sweet spot where adventurous bop and tasty small-group swing met and made beautiful music together.\n\nWhile Ella Fitzgerald would soon become the best-selling artist at Verve, Oscar Peterson was the label’s heart and soul. He defines mainstream jazz. The most technically gifted jazz pianist of any era, Peterson could be a dazzling soloist doing lightning fast bop runs, a funky, blues-soaked ivory tinkler, a musical innovator, or a relaxing master of candle lit balladry. Peterson was also a gifted accompanist who backed up pretty much every star horn player and vocalist at Verve.\n\nBassist Ray Brown and guitarist Barney Kessel completed the core Oscar Peterson Trio and were backed by Sinatra drummer Alvin Stoller. The front line soloists were saxophonist Flip Phillips (born Filipelli, he became a star with Woody Herman) and trumpeter Charlie Shavers, who played with everyone from Tommy Dorsey to Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nThe set opens with a short Charlie Shavers’ horn intro before Billie Holiday comes in with a gentle, rolling reading of “East of the Sun,” a tune that was becoming tied to the Cool, West Coast jazz scene. Phillips solos behind Holiday as she sings while Shavers returns for the solo break. Oscar Peterson’s funky intro to “Blue Moon” keeps the mood high even as Holiday, in her only studio recording of the Rodgers & Hart standard, paints darker corners into what should be a completely upbeat tune.\n\nBoth Phillips (creamy/dreamy) and Shavers (sharper/tarter) solo, a study in contrasts that go together. The horns sit it out for a lovely, otherworldly ballad reading of “You Go To My Head,” which Holiday helped turn into a standard way back in 1938. Very sweet interplay between Kessel’s guitar and Peterson’s piano on this one. The tempo, and pain quotient, increases for the first torch song, “You Turned The Tables On Me,” with Phillips echoing the bruised sentiments behind Holiday’s vocals. Oscar Peterson lays down emotionally stabbing block chords on the main solo.\n\nHoliday first cut Cole Porter’s “Easy To Love” back in 1936 with Teddy Wilson and, this reading, with Charlie Shavers taking the solo, is tastier and cuts deeper. The song can be performed as a boast but in Holiday’s hands it gets stripped of any confidence. Like the dad in 16 Candles lets his daughter know, its called a crush because it hurts. Its just the drummer-less Oscar Peterson trio on a sumptuously sad stroll through “These Foolish Things,” another revisit of a past triumph that I prefer to the original. This tune makes clear why albums from the LP era work best on vinyl — side 1 ends, the needle leaves the groove and yet the lingering sentiments from the song slowly fall through the air like autumn leaves.\n\nSide 2 kicks off with a complete mood shift. “I Only Have Eyes For You” is taken at a relatively fast clip, with Billie Holiday’s confidence back, deliciously singing behind the beat. Once again, Shavers gets a short, very bright and brassy solo while Phillips gently works behind an elated Lady Day. Barney Kessel’s guitar leads off the title cut, a brilliant slo-mo reading of Duke Ellington’s “Solitude” that features Shavers’ horn in a relaxed, warm-toned light. Its the kind of tune that allows you to happily luxuriate in the despair. This version would seem peerless until you hear Holiday’s 1946 reading for Decca, with a very Ellingtonian arrangement. It is just as wonderful.\n\nThe ballad “Everything I Have Is Yours” was a career defining hit for Billy Eckstine, though Holiday cuts all the fat off of his BIG, floridly romantic reading of the tune. Once again, Flip Phillips sadly echos Holiday’s lines, bringing darker hues to her rapturous pronouncements of devoted love. The brilliant Cole Porter gets another nod on the LP with a dramatically low-key saunter through “Love For Sale,” with all the musicians falling away except for Oscar Peterson. Written for a 1930 Broadway show, the tune was once considered so scandalous that it remained banned on radio even after the producers changed the color of the prostitute singing it from white to black.\n\nAnother complete change in tempo, and emotional direction, on “Moonglow,” with Shavers echoing just behind Holiday, then taking a solo that turns up the heat without ever burning out the romance. The most famous instrumental reading of this standard is by The Benny Goodman Quartet, with Lady Day’s most distinguished accompanist, Teddy Wilson, on piano and Lionel Hampton taking the spotlight on vibes. It’s a perfect performance that is gaining legions of new fans by being featured in the soundtrack of a huge video game franchise. Holiday’s reading is almost as tasty and is my favorite vocal interpretation. A couple years after Lady Day cut this, “Moonglow” was relaunched to a mass audience in the movie Picnic. In an outdoor, summer night dance scene between William Holden and Kim Novak, the duo hold back their emotions yet felt the moon glow so much that the entire film was banned by the Catholic Legion of Decency.\n\nThe entire ensemble is featured in the ending ballad, “Tenderly,” a song which Sarah Vaughan and Rosemary Clooney both had hit singles with. Hit this tune too hard and it breaks. Billie Holiday treats it just right and the listener ends the album enraptured.\n\nSome honest despair here but a lot of emotional notes, may of them rapturous or upbeat, are hit on Solitude. Billie Holiday sang like an actress — she inhabits the role of the song and brings out meaning to words that may fall flat on the page. A song ends and a completely new performance starts with a fresh point of view and a different set of insights. There is nothing despairing about an artist working at the top of her game.\n\n— Nick Dedina"
