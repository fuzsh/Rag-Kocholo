Billie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan, 1915-1959) was a legendary American singer, songwriter and social phenomenon. Her soulful, unique singing voice, introspective songwriting, as well as her ability to boldly turn any material that she confronted into her own, made her a superstar of her time and decades beyond. Considered to be one of the greatest jazz voices of all time, Holiday’s intense, emotive, highly stylized and endlessly nuanced vocal style has become one of the most imitated. She changed and revolutionized the art of traditional pop vocal music forever.

As a songwriter, Holiday’s own famous compositions include “Fine And Mellow”, “Deep Song”, “Lady Sings The Blues” and “Don’t Explain”, which has been covered by dozens of notable artists, including Nina Simone, Etta James, Chet Baker, John Coltrane, Sarah Vaughn and Dinah Washington. The 1972 biopic “Lady Sings The Blues”, named after Holiday’s hit song, which starred Diana Ross as Holiday, was loosely based on Holiday’s 1956 autobiography of the same title.

Her emotive voice, innovative techniques, touching songs and iconic image will forever be remembered and enjoyed as they continue to impact and be embraced by modern popular culture. Ms. Holiday is the recipient of numerous awards, including five Grammy’s as well as being an inductee of the Grammy Hall of Fame, Rock And Roll Hall of Fame and ASCAP Jazz Wall Of Fame.
