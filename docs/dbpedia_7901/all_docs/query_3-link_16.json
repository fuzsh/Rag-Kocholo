        "text": "Sound plays a huge part in telling the story and the viewer’s overall experience watching a film. The three types of sound are dialogue, sound effects, and music. The most important function of dialogue is Scorsese’s use of Henry Hill as a voice over narrator. First, this adds credibility to the fact that this is based on a true story as Henry Hill tells the story and the scene unfolds in front of our eyes. Also, had Henry used another character to narrate it would have most likely ended upon their death or imprisonment, so naturally Henry Hill was the right person to take this movie all the way to the end. Another notable piece of dialouge is the liberal use of foul language particularly the word, “fuck.” This word is used 300 times throughout the 146 minute movie according to IMdb. This is done to capture the rough, gritty, and dirty life lived by these individuals. They were flashy and refined on the outside, but utterly filthy in their dealings.\n\nScorsese uses a wide variety of music in this film that ranges from the 1950’s to the 1970’s. Not by coincidence, this is also approximately around the same time period that this film took place. Scorsese used appropriate music from the time period, but some would argue that oftentimes the music did not match the scene. For example:\n\nIn this clip the song “Atlantis” by Danovan plays in the background as Billy Batts is beat to death by Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway. However, Scorsese is a genius in that he was able to show on film and through sound how although absolute rage is going on inside the club; this is where these people are at peace as they exact sweet revenge. This type of music is different than what we see in many action movies because it does not include the quick tempo heart racing music that we are used to.\n\nAs is the case in any gangster film, sound effects are used throughout the film to highlight theme, mood, power, and intensity. You hear all kinds of sound effects from the fronted family life of pots and pans in the kitchen and televisions playing in the background. You hear the gangster grit in the gunshots, squealing tires, and bodies being plunged into the river. You also hear the glitz and glam of money being counted and deals going down. You hear the city setting in the horns honking and cars passing. Sound effects effectively create theme and mood throughout the movie.\n\nGoodfellas. (n.d.).
