        "text": "My favourite film of all time is “GoodFellas”. It’s an inspirational movie that’s all about business.\n\nIt starts with the greatest words in cinema history “as far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster”. For “gangster” read businessman. That’s all a gangster is in \"GoodFellas\". It’s all about business.\n\nThe whole concept of “GoodFellas” is business. It’s a community working together to achieve business goals. Most of the film is all about camaraderie and seeking resolutions to “business problems” . All of what the “gangsters” do and say is a mixture of negotiation, persuasion and marketing. Just like business people.\n\nThey’re also entrepreneurs. “if they wanted something they just took it”. They never felt like working for someone else, they were always working for themselves, well within their community. They were all “self-made men” just within a different more mafiosa and moral context. Everyone had to be resourceful, determined and creative to generate funds as all people business people have to be.\n\nMany a businessmen of influence and power think the same way as the “entrepreneurs” in “GoodFellas”. They ask their friends and people they know for favours, just like they do in “GoodFellas”. People ask them for favours too in return. It’s all quid pro quo.\n\nIt’s not what you know it’s who you know in “GoodFellas” just like it is in real business life. They know the right people to get the right deal, whether it’s to get a dinner seating when the restaurant is sold out (the equivalent of the American Express Black card concierge or knowing the GM personally) or a looking for a deal for sought after goods.\n\nThere’s some great lines in film too:\n\n“Hits never bothered Jimmy (De Niro), to Jimmy hits were just business”. For “hits” read eradicating the competition. Taking on the competition and winning\n\n“Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut”. If a business associate tells you something confidential you don’t tell people you shouldn’t, it’s a business code of silence and confidentiality. Those that break that code of silence in the business world won’t be trusted just like in \"GoodFellas\" where they wouldn’t be around long or be unhappy in witness protection.\n\n“Everyone takes a beating sometime” is another great line - ups and downs in business happen all the time. The business world and the \"GoodFellas\" world are very similar, it’s just a different way of life to achieve very similar business goals, to create and sustain a successful business.\n\n“What do you do?” a girl asks the main man Henry Hill. “I’m in construction” he replies. Henry Hill’s LinkedIn profile would probably say something like that and that's he’s an entrepreneur in that area. Is that any different to the multitude of people who put “entrepreneur” on their LinkedIn profile when they still work for HP or Microsoft? Spin, marketing, half truth. As in business as in “GoodFellas”.\n\nThere are many other similarities to business too in “GoodFellas”, there is great camaraderie amongst peers, they socialise together all the time to discuss business. There are also many rivalries with other “firms” that offer a similar service. They work very hard on their own company branding to differentiate their “firm” from others.\n\nReputation is key in \"GoodFellas\" both for the people involved and the \"firm\" they represent. The competition and authorities have to know who the \"boss\" is just like any other CEO. If they're weak they will fall, if they're strong they will succeed.\n\nThey all dress very well too, to impress, create the right personal branding impression. Just like in real business they realise that if they want to gain attention and make a mark that they need to dress for it and pay attention to their own personal branding. They also do love the colour black and wear it to create that ultimate branding statement.\n\nWhat do you think, what is your favourite movie that you could relate to business?"
