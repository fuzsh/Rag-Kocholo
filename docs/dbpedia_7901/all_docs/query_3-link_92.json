        "text": "Like I even need to review this one. GoodFellas is arguably one of the best gangster stories ever put to 35mm film, and what makes it so effective is not just the film and acting craft, but the fact that it's real. The main character, Henry Hill, exists.\n\nHe was one of the first mobsters to rat out his friends, sending a lot of people to jail for a long time, before disappearing into the FBI's witness protection program. He's since emerged, becoming a regular on Howard Stern's show, not to mention lots of cable TV programs discussing what's left of the Mob. With his enemies dead or in jail, Hill has little to worry about. He thinks.\n\nTo compare this film to The Godfather would be entirely wrong. Don Corleone was the head of a crime family. Henry Hill and his buddies were low-level foot soldiers. Henry and his partner Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) never could be made members because they were part-Irish.\n\nThat's what makes this film far more intense. We see the Mob life in all its blood red messiness. It opens with the trio of Henry, Jimmy and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) in a car late one night and hearing noise coming from the trunk. They pull over, open the trunk and inside is a bloody mess of a man, who is promptly knifed and shot. Romantic? Not this tale.\n\nLike so many kids from a working class New York neighborhood, Henry Hill grew up around wiseguys. He watched them on the street and saw the wealth, power and respect they commanded, even at the lowest levels. Not content to fawn along with the others, he wanted into that life, and got into it quickly.\n\nYoung Henry (played by Christopher Serrone, in his first and only acting role) takes his lumps, gets pinched and handles it properly, thus earning a place of trust. As an adult (now played by Liotta) he's a full-fledged foot soldier, working with Jimmy and Tommy. They hijacked trucks, usually with the willful assistance of the driver, robbed airports of international currency and ran protection schemes.\n\nNo one but Martin Scorsese could do this material justice. He's a New York native who grew up around people like this. I didn't know this until reading Ebert's review, but he's a life-long asthmatic, so he couldn't play like the other kids while growing up. This led him to be an observer who took in everything and put it all back into his films.\n\nI grew up in an Italian neighborhood (big shock, right?) but it was nothing like the neighborhoods of Scorsese. If GoodFellas can be considered his third masterpiece, after Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, then his denial of an Oscar is the third injustice Hollywood has heaped on him.\n\nThe first hour is so perfectly done, a testament to Scorsese's talents. Everything seems idyllic. Henry has married a Jewish girl, Karen (Lorraine Bracco) who seems to not only accept her husband's decidedly non-9 to 5 job but rationalizes it away in her voice-over narrations. Henry, Jimmy and Tommy run their scams and have a good time.\n\nThey tolerate Jimmy's violent nature because he manages to stay within the bounds. The real Tommy DeVito was a big, hulking man, around 6'2\", according to Hill. Joe Pesci falls a little shy of that mark, but he channels small man syndrome effectively, making him even more menacing than De Niro, who knows how to scare the crap out of you. His whole \"How am I funny?\" scene with Liotta will be studied in film school until they no longer make movies.\n\nThen Jimmy kills a made man, something non-made guys cannot do, and it all spirals out of control. From there on, the fun is gone, the good times become fewer and it goes down hill. By the end, Henry is on cocaine when he's not selling it, suffering the paranoia effects of it and trying to keep his wife and mistress happy.\n\nWe learn in the extras that the average life span of a mobster before incarceration or death is around seven to nine years. Henry Hill somehow put in thirty years. In the end, there was no retirement watch when he went into witness protection. He had nothing, not even a Social Security card.\n\nScore: 10 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nTime for rejoicing is here. GoodFellas was one of the first movies issued on DVD when the platform launched in 1997. It was non-anamorphic and a flipper to boot. Well, those days are done as Warner presents the film in a beautiful 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation.\n\nWell, it's not perfect. There's slight film grain, which is not surprising, Most old school directors seem to prefer a hint of film grain, as opposed to the pristine digital image younger directors like.\n\nA bigger problem is notable MPEG blocking. The one that really jumped out at me was the introduction of Jimmy Conway. The picture freezes on him, and it looks like an AVI file on your computer that's been blown up too large. You'll also notice that Jimmy's face is a little redder than is natural.\n\nBy and large, though, it's a very good print. Edge enhancement and ghosting/halos have been whacked and buried where no one will find them. There's the odd dust fleck here and there but nothing to get worked up over. Color levels are all excellent. Black levels are solid, but whites have a bit of noise present. Skin tones, as noted above, have a touch of redness to them, but nothing severe.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nGoodFellas comes with an English and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack and subtitles in English, French and Spanish. Generally speaking, films that predate the advent of Dolby Digital 5.1 don't quite match up to a film made afterwards, and in the case of GoodFellas, it doesn't really need it.\n\nGranted, there are opportunities for surround sound to immerse you in the moment - like in the Copacabana club or when the wiseguys get together at their clubs. The audio does come from those channels, if you stick your ear to them. But by and large, it's a center-channel experience because it's almost entirely dialogue-driven.\n\nIn that regard, dialogue is all clear and free of any distortion, and you do get the background effect of mumbled, unintelligible dialogue and clinking glasses. Gunshots and other loud sounds are suitable, but not stunning. In short, it gets the job done.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nPackaging and Extras\n\nGoodFellas comes in a two-disc Amaray case with no insert. You can either get the disc as a stand-alone SKU for $26.99 SRP or as part of the Martin Scorsese Collection, which includes Who's That Knocking at My Door, Mean Streets, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, After Hours and Goodfellas for $59.92. The other titles are available for $19.97.\n\nOn disc one we have two commentaries, two of the best I've heard in a while. The first is with Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Frank Vincent, Martin Scorsese, writer Nicholas Pileggi, producers Irwin Winkler and Barbara De Fina, cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.\n\nThey were clearly recorded separately and their comments stitched together, but so what? This commentary track is loaded with everything you could want to know about the movie, the world in which it takes place, real life events, you name it. After hearing the term \"wop\" thrown around for so many years I finally learned its origins.\n\nEven better is The Crook and The Cop, with Henry Hill and FBI agent Edward McDonald, who put him in witness protection. Hill is a riot, telling all kinds of stories, how things were compared to the movie, you name it. McDonald spends most of the time acting as interviewer, questioning Hill about things. There are too many great stories to pick one. Just listen to this one.\n\nFinally, on disc one, you have a three page text listing of all the awards that this film was nominated for.\n\nOn disc two, things are a little disappointing. I was hoping for more. Getting Made is a 30 minute featurettes on the making of the movie. It has current day interviews with Pileggi, Liotta and Bracco plus interviews from 1990 with Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci. This is an excellent look at how the film came together and was done, but it features too much fawning over Scorsese. We know he's brilliant, we saw the movie.\n\nThe Workaday Gangster runs eight minutes and features Hill talking about what life was like for a mobster. Fact is, these guys didn't work 9-to-5, they were working every waking hour. Some of the cast also comment.\n\nThe Goodfellas Legacy is a 13 minute piece with comments from a rich collection of directors, from Richard Linklater to the Hughes brothers to Jon Favreau to Antione Fuqua. All heap praise on the film and how it affected them.\n\nPaper Is Cheaper Than Film shows how tiny, minimal pencil sketches made by Scorsese on the script became the most memorable scenes in the movie. Film students will love it.\n\nFinally, there's the theatrical trailer. Shame there were no deleted scenes, unless there weren't any. A present-day interview with De Niro or Pesci, the one person to get an Oscar out of this movie, would have been nice, too.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nAll photos ¿ 2004 Warner Home Video, used with permission."
