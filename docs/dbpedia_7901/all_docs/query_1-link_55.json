        "text": "Goodfellas v.s. Once Upon a Time in America\n\nHi there!\n\nMy name is John Milon and I'm the founder of the Film Buffs facebook group and the Film Buffs Youtube channel. Today I'd like to talk abit about and compare two great gangster films. Once Upon a Time in America and Goodfellas. Once Upon A Time in America is the last film directed by Italian director Sergio Leone and released in 1984. Goodfellas is directed by Martin Scorcese and is based off the true life story and experiences of Harry Hill played by Ray Liotta and was released in 1990.\n\nCan these films really be compared? Apart from the obvious gangster relation and both being set in America they are quite different animals. Once Upon a Time in america is a slow moving and lengthy film...the original film cut was originally 10 hours whittled down to 6 then ultimately 4 when Leone was forced to trim further by the studios. The narrative follows a chronological mix of memories and flashbacks spanning 4 decades in the life of De Niro 's character. Goodfellas on the other hand is far more straightforward storytelling. Moves at a brisk unrelenting pace. Everything is much clearer, simpler. And it's based on a true story of course. De Niro gives a very different performance in both films...in Goodfellas he's a more brash, violent, loud and emotive character. In Once upon a Time he delivers a far more low key and modest performance and underplays most scenes...reminiscent of the kind of performance we got in Tinker Tailor Spy Soldier from Gary Oldman. Yet he's brutally effective and just as powerful. Having watched Goodfellas again last night I completely fell in love with it again. To me it is, in its own way, practically a perfect film. Overall definitely the more, instantly anyways, entertaining of the two and definitely my favourite Scorcese (Taxi Driver a very very close second )picture. Every one of the main characters are acted to perfection and you believe each of them completely. The film is also far more brutal then I remembered. The ease at which people are casually murdered is shocking. Is it Joe Pesci's best ever performance? Possibly though I'd have to rewatch casino and raging bull. Needless to say he's incredible in it as is just about everybody in the film. Sergio Leone's film by contrast is the more emotionally potent and moving of the two. It's an incredibly beautiful take on friendship trust loyalty and love amidst a backdrop of evil, violence and greed. Unlike it's rival it makes you think, nothing is handed on a silver platter. In place of instant gratification we get a slow released feeling of wonderment at witnessing something very special. At its premiere in Cannes the audience shouted and cheered, gave a 15 minute standing ovation. They couldn't believe just how good it was! And it also benefits from Ennio Morricone's score which famously was not submitted to the Oscars due to a clerical filing error. Imo it is one of the three best scores ever made for film. The others being Maurice Jarre's Lawrence of Arabia score and John Barry for Dances with Wolves. Those are two other very, very impressive film scores.\n\nSo in conclusion?\n\nBoth practically perfect films. Both the opus work of two incredibly talented masters, working at the peak of their powers.\n\nRatings wise, both films get a perfect 10/10 from me. I absolutely love both these films.\n\nThank you for listening guys hope you enjoyed this review, and stay tuned for more film reviews from myself and other reviewers at Film Buffs. Thank you very much."
