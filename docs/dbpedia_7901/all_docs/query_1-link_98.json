        "text": "The process of test-screening films is an inexact science, but it’s generally accepted that if members of the audience are baying for the director’s blood within five minutes, then something has gone wrong. A little over three decades ago, that was the situation facing Martin Scorsese and his producer Irwin Winkler, when they tried out their latest project – a gangster picture called Goodfellas – on an unsuspecting crowd.\n\nToday, it’s hard to imagine Scorsese’s signature masterpiece, which opened in British cinemas 30 years ago this month, being met with anything other than rapturous acclaim. His soul-rattling adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi’s Wiseguy – a nonfiction chronicle of the life of the Brooklyn mobster turned FBI informant Henry Hill – would go on to rejuvenate not only its director’s career, but the gangster genre outright, and has been endlessly quoted and celebrated ever since.\n\nBut on that evening in the Los Angeles suburbs, its prospects looked about as rosy as those of poor Billy Batts, the luckless mafioso who is repeatedly stabbed and shot in a car boot by Joe Pesci’s Tommy DeVito and Robert De Niro’s Jimmy Conway in the film’s opening scene.\n\n“Marty had been getting a lot of criticism from conservative groups over The Last Temptation of Christ, and the preview was in deepest Ronald Reagan country,” the 89-year-old Winker chortles down the phone in a spry New York twang from his office in Beverly Hills. “So when his name came up, some guy yelled out, ‘Hey, let’s get that guy! Let’s get Scorsese!’”\n\nThe second test screening was no more successful. “We had a lot of walkouts during that first murder,” Winkler remembers. “By the time the movie was over, I’d say three quarters of the audience had gone.” The film’s unbridled violence, plus its discombobulating moral push-pull of glamour and malevolence, was not landing as they’d hoped it would. Winkler recalls leafing through the reaction cards in the foyer afterwards and finding one which read simply: “F___ you.”\n\n“The studio executives from Warner Bros wanted to cut the movie down, and get rid of a lot of the violence,” Winkler says. But Scorsese stuck to his guns. “Marty was telling them, ‘I'll try this. I'll try that.’ And he did. And none of it worked. In the end, we kept the film exactly how we wanted it.” The following September, Goodfellas had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, and was met with rave reviews.\n\nWinkler rose up in Hollywood the old-fashioned way, starting in the mailroom of the mighty William Morris Talent Agency, before moving into management, and then producing in the late 1960s. Goodfellas was his third film with Scorsese after New York, New York and Raging Bull. (The two men would collaborate on three more, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence and The Irishman, in the years ahead.) He still remembers the moment he first encountered Pileggi’s book – or rather an extract from it published in a 1986 issue of New York magazine.\n\nHe was living in Paris at the time, and was browsing the periodicals in an English-language bookshop on the Rue de Rivoli. “The idea of doing a gangster film really didn’t interest me because I thought The Godfather one and two had said all there was to say,” he recalls. “But I started reading the excerpt and I just couldn’t put it down. I kept expecting to be thrown out of the store.”\n\nHe snapped up the film rights immediately – then heard through a friend that Scorsese, who was filming The Colour of Money in Chicago, had been wowed by the same extract. A deal was quickly struck with Warner Bros, but the film’s proposed $16 million budget – “not expensive, but not cheap either,” says Winkler – was giving the studio pause.\n\n“They wanted to ‘cast it up’, as the term goes, with big stars,” he explains. “And this became a whole, big issue.” Extraordinarily, the studio’s first choices for the roles of Henry Hill and his wife Karen – which were eventually taken by Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco – were Tom Cruise and Madonna. \"Tom Cruise was smarter than them,” Winker laughs. “He said it wasn’t for him straight away.” Scorsese had been impressed by Bracco when she’d auditioned for his 1985 black comedy After Hours, and had his heart set on Liotta too – but Winkler initially wasn’t convinced.\n\n“I thought it was a part for a truly great actor, and at the time, I didn’t consider Ray to be one of them,” he says. But while dining out with the producer Richard Zanuck and their wives one evening, Liotta spotted him, sidled over to the table, and asked if he could have a quiet word outside.\n\n\"He said, ‘Look, I know you don’t think I'm right for the role, but let me convince you.’ And he went on for 15 or 20 minutes, and I was completely enraptured. I called Marty afterwards and said, ‘I see exactly what you saw.’”\n\nThe studio may not have prevailed on the Cruise-Madonna front, but unwelcome oars were still inserted throughout the shoot. Winkler remembers being on set for the filming of Pesci’s infamous “Funny how?” scene, which the actor had devised himself based on a blood-curdling incident from his own life. (While working as a waiter in New York, he’d once made the mistake of telling a mobster he found him amusing.)\n\nThe head of the studio, Terry Semel, was also on set, and didn’t recognise the exchange from the script. “He said, ‘This isn’t supposed to be in the movie!’,” Winkler recalls. “And he told us if we were going to shoot this, then we had to give something else up in exchange.” In the end, Winkler cancelled a trip to Florida to film the sequence in which Liotta and De Niro dangle an adversary by his legs into the lion enclosure at Tampa Bay Zoo. They shot the sequence in the distinctly less tropical New York borough of Queens, with a lot of pot plants in the background.\n\nIt’s been a while since Winkler was on a film set, now that the pandemic has brought Hollywood grinding to a halt. He has “three or four” projects ready to go, including Dee Rees’s adaptation of the George Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess for MGM, and the third instalment in the Creed boxing franchise, which he lets slip will be the directorial debut of its star, Michael B Jordan.\n\nFilming on both should be underway by early spring. And he hopes that this kind of movie – bolder, nimbler and with a stronger, more distinctive voice than the hundred-million-dollar blockbusters currently mouldering away on the studios’ shelves – will be able to bring about the industry’s revival.\n\nHe’s reminded of the 1970s, “when along came Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Steven Spielberg, Sydney Pollack, who is too often forgotten, and the others, who made films that were much closer to where their audience was. The audience for the old studio films had gone, and wasn’t coming back. The business was rescued by so-called mavericks, and Scorsese was probably the biggest maverick of them all.”\n\nA Life in Movies: Stories from 50 years in Hollywood by Irvin Winkler is published by Abrams Press (£18.99)"
