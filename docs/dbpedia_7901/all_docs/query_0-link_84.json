And then I asked [editor Thelma Schoonmaker], ‘How many more we got left?’ And she says: ‘Seven.’ So okay. We didn’t need them leaving this soon, okay? We see the knife, we get it.”\n\nThe finished film shows Pesci stabbing Batts four times with the last three occurring off-screen as Ray Liotta’s character watches on.\n\nOscars: 21 great films that never won Best Picture\n\nShow all 23\n\nGoing by Rotten Tomatoes, Scorsese’s The Irishman is his best reviewed film since 1976 drama Taxi Driver.\n\nThe new film, based on Charles Brandt’s book I Heard You Paint Houses, marks the ninth collaboration between the filmmaker and Robert De Niro.\n\nAl Pacino and Joe Pesci also star in the mob drama that follows real-life Mafia hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) across several decades of his life and his experiences with labour union teamster Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and crime boss Russell Bufalino (Pesci).\n\nThe Irishman will be released in selected UK cinemas on 8 November, before arriving on Netflix from 27 November.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
