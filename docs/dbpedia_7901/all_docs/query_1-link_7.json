        "text": "They’re whacking a classic.\n\nAMC Networks added a trigger warning to the classic mob movie “Goodfellas” — rankling those who were in the film and wiseguys alike.\n\n“This film includes language and/or cultural stereotypes that are inconsistent with today’s standards of inclusion and tolerance and may offend some viewers,” a message reads at the top of the film when screened on the network.\n\nThe warning was first affixed to the movie during the height of Black Lives Matter riots when many businesses and cultural institutions made avoiding offense to various groups a core part of their missions.\n\nDisney has made a cottage industry of affixing warnings to their century-long oeuvre of content.\n\n“In 2020, we began adding advisories in front of certain films that include racial or cultural references that some viewers might find offensive,” an AMC rep told The Post.\n\nBut the warning for Goodfellas apparently doesn’t apply to other mob flicks. “The Godfather” — which also plays on AMC and features many of the same themes — is presented with a more standard “viewer discretion” warning covering “brief nudity, strong language and intense violence.”\n\n“The f–king political correctness has f–king taken everything away,” Bo Ditel, a former NYPD cop who played a police officer in “Goodfellas,” told The Post. “This is how life was back then. It was not a clean beautiful thing. You can’t cleanse history. If you want to tell true history, you gotta tell it the way it is.”\n\nMichael Franzese, a one-time captain of the Colombo crime family, said he was amused by the note\n\n“We don’t need anyone protecting mob guys. It’s crazy,” he said.\n\nThe 1990 Martin Scorsese film is widely considered one of the best mob flicks ever made, and earned Joe Pesci an Academy Award for his memorable performance as the psychotic gangster Tommy DeVito. In 2000, the United States Library of Congress declared the film “culturally significant” and added it for preservation in the National Film Registry."
