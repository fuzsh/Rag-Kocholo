        "text": "Goodfellas, a film that shows a fantastic use of sound throughout utilizes these tools to draw the audience in and to captivate each scene. Sound is such a vital part of film, as dialogue and music work together with sound effects to bring a scene together.\n\nSound in a film has multiple elements that come together to create the feeling and perception that the director is looking for in a scene. One major element of sound is dialogue. In the movie Goodfellas and films like this the quality and volume of the dialogue is very important. In the scene above, Ray Liotta (as Henry Hill) narrates the scene from a non-diegetic perspective, or to perceived coming from outside of the scene. This is a very useful element that allows the audience to experience the scene that is taking place, in this case the explanation of the fallout of the infamous Lufthansa heist and the eventual mob murder of Tommy. The scene has many elements going on with multiple bodies being discovered as well as the explanation of Tommy’s proposed assent to Mafia royalty and being “straightened out”. Overall the sound team does a fantastic job of layering the narrative dialogue over the music and sound effects.\n\nIn this same scene, we can see the effective use of scoring and music with the infamous Eric Clapton song “Layla”. While the overall song may not fit the scene, the use of the musical breakdown and overture are sampled perfectly into the scene and are as much a part of the production as any actor or scene design. When you think of this scene in the movie it is impossible to not remember the howling of Clapton’s guitar and the emotional drive that the pianist aids to the song. I cannot imagine this scene without Layla blaring over the horrific destruction occurring in the scene.\n\nFinally, sound effects may be some of the most underrated aspects of a scene. In the movie Goodfellas, with the numerous gun shootouts and altercations the use of sound effects to recreate or capture the sounds that would accompany the onscreen action are very well deployed. A favorite scene of mine to exemplify this is when Henry is bringing Karen home after her neighbor attempts to molest her in his car. The scene begins with some minor dialogue which is than accompanied by great sound effects. The sound of the car doors being shut to the sound of Henry’s shoes on the pavement are staged perfectly. In the background we can hear the sounds of dogs barking and subtle noises that place the audience int he setting of the scene. The most impact though came from the mimicked sound of Henry’s gun bluntly smashing off of the neighbors face. To see it does make you cringe, but I remember that sound as clear as day and the sound is was really curdled your stomach and made you realize the impact that Henry was placing on this man and the damage that was done. Remove this key element of sound and I truly believe the scene does not have the same impact.\n\nOverall, the sound engineering and editing in the film Goodfellas is on par with the cinematography and screenplay as well as the acting and directing. The sound, and especially the scoring of the film (probably one of the best “Mob” soundtracks out) bring the film together to make for a truly enjoyable and remember-able experience. The use of dialogue within the scenes and from a narrative point of view allow the audience to feel as if they are being shown and told a story. Any element that would be removed from this films sound would be detrimental to the overall effect that you are meant to perceive.\n\nReferences\n\nGoodfellas. (n.d.). YouTube.
