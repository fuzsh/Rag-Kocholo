        "text": "It sounds like one of that short joke that are told in the area of \"ciociaria\" (or more south than that). I can understand why 'it sounds much better in Italian'.\n\nI noticed that many of these jokes are kind of self-ironical. It's like that these people like to tease themselves.\n\nHere, there is an entire after-marriage situation that is depicted in just smart 2 lines. After marriage these countryside woman (but not only them, actually) tend to lose their beauty quite rapidly. Also there is another aspect: do you remember our discussion about the \"henpecked man\" (a defeated man).\n\nHere the 2 lines smartly depict this situation. The man has become taciturn, because he doesn't have much reason to enjoy anymore. When requested to talk, the wife, who clearly doesn't like this remark, tells him he is talking too much (implying he has to shut up).\n\nBut I guess you have to imagine the whole setting in a countryside jovial atmosphere. It's hard to explain....\n\nshamblesuk said:\n\nCiao a tutti,\n\nC'è un scherzo (basta, Lee) in Goodfellas (spoken by Joe Pesci's mum). It's about a man who's wife complains in company that he never says anything. He then says 'What am I going to say, that my wife two-times me'. His wife then says 'You talk too much'\n\nIn the film Pesci's mum then says 'it sounds much better in Italian'.\n\nQualcuno sa il scherzo originale, e mi può spiegare perché è buffo?\n\nGrazie 1000\n\nshamblesuk\n\nNo Alfry, to 'two-time' means to have an affair with someone else behind your partner's back.\n\nAlfry said:\n\nI'm not sure,\n\nmaybe as we call our wives \"la mia metà\" he is trying to play on that saying \"she two-times me\" = \"lei mi raddoppia\" meaning, in this case, that she talks more than him and/or she is bigger than he is, è il doppio di lui\n\nI should watch that film to be sure, though"
