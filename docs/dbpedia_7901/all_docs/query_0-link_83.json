        "text": "ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL'S famous pronouncement -- ''Mr. Watson, come here, I want you.'' -- was the first intelligible sentence spoken by telephone. And the last intelligible sentence spoken by a Scotsman, in any medium. Or so it would seem to unaccustomed ears. Ask the Scottish director Bill Forsyth, whose 1981 film ''Gregory's Girl'' had to be redubbed for American and English audiences. Thick burrs were rendered thinner than cock-a-leekie soup.\n\nThings have gotten worse. ''My Name is Joe,'' a Glasgow-set feature from the director Ken Loach, was recently released here with subtitles, as if it weren't even nominally in English. When we phoned him for comment, Loach was indignant. At least we think he was indignant. At least we think he was Loach. Frankly, we couldn't understand a word.\n\nThe same can be said for a whole rash of recent British movies: from the Newcastle horseracing saga ''Eden Valley'' (1994) to the Edinburgh junkie saga ''Trainspotting'' (1996) to the Nottingham boxing saga ''24-7'' (1998). To American audiences, these films might as well be in Northern Malawian CheCheewa. Moviegoers on these shores have long been baby-powdered by British actors who pamper every line as if the English language were a newborn's bottom. If we weren't savoring the plummy consonants in stuffy Merchant-Ivory productions, we were relishing the plumped vowels in stifling Elizabethan costume dramas. Lately, though, British movies have become both less mannered and less manored. And the grittier the fiction, the muddier the diction. The British cinema isn't dead, it's just not speaking as clearly.\n\n''When I was growing up in Glasgow in the 1960's, to move ahead, to make money, to get a job anywhere that required opening your mouth, you had to speak BBC English,'' says Lex Braes, an abstract painter who now lives in Brooklyn (the borough that served as the setting for ''Goodfellas'' -- a film whose dialogue was equally incomprehensible to British audiences). ''These days it's not just O.K. to have a burr or a brogue over there, it's desirable. It's like New Labor -- 'Hey, we're all included.' That attitude carries over to the British cinema, where it's suddenly fashionable to have a regional accent.''\n\nIf so, the height of British cinematic fashion may be ''My Name is Joe,'' a film about a recovering alcoholic whose name we could never quite make out. Loach has been making pointed, poignant features about England's underclass since ''Kes'' (1969), a boy-meets-falcon tale that should have been closed-captioned for the Leeds-impaired. ''Joe'' is an even harder go. If you close your eyes (and you will), it is difficult to ascertain a single line of dialogue. The cast was voice-coached, evidently, by the guy who announces stops on New Jersey Transit trains. The title character has all the elocution of Mickey Rourke, which explains why the French loved him so. Peter Mullan, who plays Joe, won the best actor prize at Cannes.\n\nAnother British export in need of explication was last year's ''Nil By Mouth.'' Even the title could use a subtitle. Alas, the newly-released video has none. Of ''Nil's'' cockamamie Cockney -- which borders on Mockney -- the director Gary Oldman has said: It's like watching Shakespeare. It all sounds like gobbledygook for the first ten minutes, you just have to work. William Shakespeare? Funny, we do not recall him writing, ''A orse, a orse, me kingdom fer a orse.'' With the exception of a very few phrases in ''Nil'' -- ''Good mornin', Guvnor''; ''a coupla geezers''; ''the ol' carrot-an'-onions'' -- what little we worked out could not be printed in a family newspaper. Volume 6 of the Encyclopedia Brittanica contains fewer F-words.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
