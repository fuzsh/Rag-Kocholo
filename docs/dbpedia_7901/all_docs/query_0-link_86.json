This is to be expected as Netflix make it harder and harder for us to pull information.\n\nIn order simplify the effort to get all the latest information, we have created this tool which will allow any user to easily submit titles which our engines will then validate and add if they are indeed missing from a particular country.\n\nIn addition to the form on this page, POST id's to:\n\nhttps://unogs.com/api/submitmissing\n\nusing the following JSON.\n\n{\"netflixID\":\"&ltid&gt\",\"countryCode\":\"&lt2 letter country code&gt\",\"user\":\"&ltusername&gt\"}\n\nGo to our Forum for more Details"
