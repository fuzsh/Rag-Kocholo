        "text": "Succinct filmmaking, satisfying performances and memorable dialogue assures Goodfellas position as a classic in the genre and Hollywood.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Feb 14, 2024\n\nGoodfellas excels in detailing the protagonist's journey within the mob, with narration that enriches rather than detracts. Despite a slower final act, it remains gripping.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Feb 14, 2024\n\nGoodfellas captures the pulse of gangster life, not just to understand what motivates these people and how they compartmentalize their choices, but to supply the audience with a shock treatment of aversion.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Jan 26, 2024\n\nIt aged perfectly, even though many imitations have emerged in the last 33 years. In dealing with shades of grey, detestable but relatable characters, brutal violence and themes of family, friendship and crime, it feels timeless. Full review in Spanish.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Nov 12, 2023\n\nThe only argument you’re bound to get into concerning Martin Scorsese’s GoodFellas is the degree of its greatness -- if it’s the most brilliant cinematic tour de force of the decade or merely this year. After 10 minutes I felt I had already seen 25 films.\n\nFull Review | Oct 18, 2023\n\nIt is intimately personal, yet so removed as to remain nonjudgmental, and therefore totally trustworthy. We give into it without reservation, because its maker assures us with every shot, every move that he knows exactly what he’s doing.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Oct 18, 2023\n\nGoodFellas, written by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese, and directed by Scorsese, is the greatest film ever made about the sensual and monetary lure of crime, and the whole perversely brilliant movie comes into focus in a single, staggering shot.\n\nFull Review | Oct 18, 2023\n\nLike everything Scorsese makes, it is crisp and clean, with exciting cinematography and superior acting. Despite its length, it is fast-moving and gripping. I walked away emotionally drained from more than two hours of tension.\n\nFull Review | Oct 18, 2023\n\nWe're taken in at our own risk, hooked on the film's speed, the power of its sights and sounds. Our nerve endings occasionally scream caveats... But we never doubt that a master at the top of his game is calling the shots.\n\nFull Review | Oct 18, 2023\n\nAll that's on the screen is a showy, humorless vaunting of directorial technique, and misplaced technique at that. Scorsese sets up the material as comedy, but he seems to consider it beneath him to let viewers find any of it funny.\n\nFull Review | Oct 18, 2023\n\nFunny and frightening, unpredictable and provocative, GoodFellas may be the most authentic Mafia picture ever made. The acting is superb, and so natural that no one -- least of all De Niro -- seems to be performing.\n\nFull Review | Oct 18, 2023\n\nThis working stiff's version of The Godfather is disappointing: It lacks depth and point of view, and a rich, sustained tone. The skin-deep style is voluptuous... But all that holds the story together is the parade of investigative revelations.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Oct 18, 2023\n\nThe simple fact, as exhilarating as it is dreadful, is that after a life of crime, Hill had but one regret -- that he had to stop. This is the engine of GoodFellas, an idea as elemental as it is radical.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Oct 18, 2023\n\nScorsese's GoodFellas is an unparalleled achievement, the most chilling and savagely droll account of mob life ever recorded on film.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Oct 18, 2023\n\nThe audience at GoodFellas spends a good deal of the movie exhilarated and laughing. It's a very funny movie, but most of the laughs are turned back on the audience. You don't get away with it.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Oct 18, 2023\n\nWith all the talent in this movie, singling out a specific performer seems capricious, but let me take a stab at it. I will grant you that De Niro is perfection... But let me reserve my loudest applause for Pesci.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Oct 18, 2023"
