        "text": "Edward James Olmos did a great job at bringing attention to the dangers of gangs and prison and life. As I was watching the film I felt extremely empathetic towards the individuals that were apart the gangs especially, since most of them joined because they felt like the other gang members were their second or only family. Olmos describes friendships as something disposable an easily broken. Although there seemed to be a strong bond in the relationships among the gang members, they were almost always destroyed by the need to maintain the other gang member’s masculinity and power. The extremes that they went through to preserve their identity as the tough guys came at deadly costs. The members had to prove their masculinity by killing their friends and in the case of\n\n\"Goodfellas\" is Martin Scorsese's movie about Henry Hill, who wants to be a gangster from an early age and becomes involved with an Italian-American crime family over three decades. The performances in this film are outstanding. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill as he lives with the benefits and dangers of mob life. Robert De Niro delivers a refined performance but as usual keeps the feel of being in charge as Jimmy Conway. Joe Pesci is memorable as the funny and psychotic Tommy DeVito. Paul Sorvino makes a convincing mob boss. Lorraine Bracco gave a wonderful and in-depth look at what it meant to be the wife of a mobster.\n\nThe movie that I chose to do my review on is the 1990 film GoodFellas. This movie chronicles the life of Henry Hill and his rise from being a small time assistant to the mob in his childhood, to when he grows up and is a full blown gangster involved in many different aspects of the organized crime group’s illegal activities. The reason that I chose GoodFellas is because it fits the requirements of this assignment nicely and it’s just a really well made movie with an all-star cast and a great story. To begin, I will cover the eight attributes of organized crime and how they are portrayed in the movie. Next I will cover the laws that were used against the organized crime group in the movie. Lastly, I will cover some of the law enforcement techniques that were used by law enforcement in the movie to capture the organized crime members. We as a society often glamorize organized crime, but in reality it is a nasty business of corruption and violence that has no business in modern society.\n\nIn the time where mobster business ruled the streets of New York, Good Fellas is a classic mafia film that brings a little bit of everything to the round table; the violence, the profanity, the sex, the drugs, and especially the money. “Forget about it!” It will have you on the edge of your seat, entertained and desiring to see more of it. Directed by Martin Scorsese, 'Good Fellas’, takes place in the 1960’s and 70’s in the beautiful state of New York. Mobsters were walking idols for the eyes of many, with nice, slick suits, puffing cigarettes with tremendous swagger. And one of them was Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, a local Irish-American kid who grows up in one of the baddest, most tough neighborhoods in the city. Dropping out of high\n\nAs Prohibition continued to drag on, the social acceptability of consuming bootlegged alcohol continued to grow alongside the increasing popularity of gangster films. As mentioned before, bootleggers had come to represent social heroes in the eyes of the public and were therefore portrayed this way in gangster films. Gangsters glamorous lifestyles began to become “glorified in the eyes of the public”, which revelled in the idea of breaking a law that they considered to be unjust. Gangsters weren’t considered to be the “bad guy”, but instead as symbols of the true desires of the American people. By the late 1920s, films such as The Underworld, The Racket, and Tenderloin, though they were all silent, continued to romanticize this idea of the gangster. However, it should also be noted that the true nature of gangster violence wasn’t explicitly depicted on screen until 1932, with the release of Scarface. Thus, audiences of the 1920s were detached from a more realistic idea of the gangster and the violence of his acts.\n\nThe film Gangs of New York is set in the mid-19th century, when violence had risen with power during the time of massive political corruption and yearning cultural assimilation. The film portrays the sociological issues that took place in this period. In 1846, a mass of Irish immigrants migrated into the city, which many natives disfavored. Narration of the multiple issues that filled the city came from the main protagonist, Amsterdam. From this, the viewer could comprehend that the issues the immigrants faced contains valid historical context behind the film like discrimination and social marginalization. Moreover, the film not only portrays a historically accurate picture about the immigrants during this century, but can be easily compared\n\nIn today’s society, when people think of organized crime they typically think of the Italian mob or the Russian mafia. This is because they are the more popular groups that society sees on the big screen and on television, as well as the ones that people talk about the most. According to the “Crime Museum”, organized crime is “a group of individuals working together to illicit profit through illegal and often violent methods”. Over the past decades, Hollywood’s film industries have fueled America’s obsession with organized crime or mafia-style films. For these types of gangster or mob movies to be effective, they must allow the audience to build a connection with one of the characters in the film, who is of questionable morals and sleazy behavior,\n\nThe Simpsons often parody many classic films. One film they parody is Goodfellas by Martin Scorsese. In this film the character Henry Hill narrates his life as a gangster. He goes through the reasons why he decided to become a gangster. He explains how being a gangster makes him feel like a somebody and how they offer him protection. The Mafia gives Henry Hill a place to call his own. The mafia becomes his family. The movie Goodfellas is based off of a book called Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi which is based on a true story. One of the reasons this film was so popular was because it was based in reality. The film details what the life of a gangster is. It also displays the message that crime does not pay. At the end of the film all the gangsters either end up dead, in jail, or in the witness protection program. Henry Hill is a great example of how crime doesn’t pay. Henry Hill during the film seems to be living the American dream. He has more money than he knows what to do with and everyone in town knows who he is. He feels as though he is living the life. These are some of the many aspects of living life outside the law that attracts the American viewer. Henry seems to be living the American dream but this dream doesn’t last very long. Before Henry knows it he is arrested for committing many crimes but the biggest one is his trafficking of cocaine. At this point it becomes clear to see that crime doesn’t pay. This film paints several of the mobster as heroes they provide"
