        "text": "It’s been 25 years since Martin Scorsese’s seminal gangster film “Goodfellas” opened to the adulation of critics, among them Vincent Canby of The New York Times, who hailed it as “breathless and brilliant.” Though it’s now considered a classic, counted by the American Film Institute as one of the country’s 100 greatest films, its foul-mouthed tale of the rise and fall of the murderous Henry Hill; his wife, Karen; and his patron, Paulie, left early audiences cold. In a nod to the anniversary, Film Forum is screening a newly restored version of the movie starting next Friday.\n\nSeveral of the film’s principals recently talked about their recollections of the production, including Nicholas Pileggi, who adapted the screenplay with Mr. Scorsese from Mr. Pileggi’s nonfiction best seller “Wiseguy.” Here are excerpts from those conversations.\n\nNicholas Pileggi I was still working at New York magazine when “Wiseguy” came out. David Denby was doing reviews. And I got a message at the magazine that Marty Scorsese called. I knew it was Denby, and I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction. Then Nora — I was married to Nora Ephron — said: “Are you crazy? Why won’t you talk to Marty Scorsese? He’s been trying to reach you, and you wouldn’t call him back?” He was in production with the same people who had worked on Nora’s movie. So I called Marty right away, and we got going. I just knew Marty was the guy to do it, no question about it. I’d go to his office. I’d do the typing, because he couldn’t type.\n\nRay Liotta (who played Henry Hill): I was on the second floor of the Excelsior Hotel [at the Venice Film Festival]. I looked down, and there was all this commotion and in the middle of it was Marty. He was there with “The Last Temptation of Christ.” I guess he was getting a lot of death threats. I beelined down there. He was surrounded by bodyguards. I started walking toward him. All the bodyguards pushed me off. I just want to say hi to Marty. I think my initial reaction was, “Get your hands off me,” acting like a tough guy, which I’m not. He said that’s when he knew.\n\nPaul Sorvino (Paulie): I would have done a “Dinner is served” role in a Scorsese picture, that’s how much I wanted to work with him. I met with him and saw immediately he wanted me for the role. I was overjoyed but very worried. I’d done a lot of comedies as well as dramas, but I’d never done a really tough guy. I never had it in me. And this called for a lethality, which I felt was way beyond me. I called my manager three days before we started shooting and said: “Get me out. I’m going to ruin this great man’s picture, and I’m going to ruin myself.” He, being wise, said, “Call me tomorrow, and if necessary I will get you out.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
