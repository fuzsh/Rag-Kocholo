        "text": "Yesterday in class I was correcting the mistakes in my translation together with my teacher. He gave us an article about the mafia in America and the Lufthansa heist at John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1978, which inspired the film Goodfellas.\n\nNear the end of the article there is this sentence:\n\n导演马丁斯科西斯年拍摄的影片 《盗亦有道》 (又译为 《好家伙》) 即根据博克的真实经历和汉莎航空大劫案改编，该片由罗伯特德尼罗主演，至今仍被认为是继 《教父》 系列之后另一部描述美国意大利黑帮的经典之作。\n\nWhich I've translated like this:\n\nThe film shooted by the director Martin Scorsese in 1990, Thieves have morals too, (also translated as The Goodfellas) is primarily based on a reconstruction of Burke's true story and the Lufthansa heist at Kennedy Airport. This film, interpreted by Robert De Niro as leading actor, is still considered today another cult movie that describes italian american mafia after the series The Godfather.\n\nMy teacher said that 美国意大利黑帮 should be \"the italian mafia in America\". I've thought about that for a while . . . If it's \"in America\", why there is no 在 before 美国?\n\nHe clarified that if it were \"italian american\", like I said, it would be something like 美意 or, better, 意美 (like in the title: 中英词典, \"Chinese-English dictionary\").\n\nI know the two translations are pretty similar in content, but I would appreciate it if someone could explain to me which is better.\n\nThank you.\n\nP.S. Sorry for my bad English; it's not my native language.\n\nChinese and English express this in different ways. Or better yet, English emphasizes the nuance that these mafiosi are of Italian descent but operate in America: Italian mafia in America.\n\nThe Chinese term 美国意大利黑帮 is just \"American-Italian\" mafia. Chinese has no proper word for demonym-adjectives, Italian will translate as 意大利人 if it is a demonym denoting a person (\"Italy-person\") and most likely 意大利的 if it is something from Italy (e.g. 意大利的经济 Italian economy) but omitting 的 is more natural in most cases, e.g. 意大利经济 Italian economy. It's a bit like headline style in English: UK minister resigns (where UK is certainly not an adjective) and not British minister resigns.\n\nSince Chinese heavily relies on context, 美国意大利黑帮 requires you to use your knowledge and understanding of the context, and put this together. English on the other hand prefers splitting this up and making clear what role Italian and American play here.\n\nanswered Nov 7, 2015 at 11:41\n\nimrekimrek\n\n7,18822 gold badges2121 silver badges3333 bronze badges"
