        "text": "The book is based on a true story, so the film follows the book fairly well except for a few changes. The character of Tommy is based mostly on mob enforcer Tommy DeSimone—in the movie, Tommy's last name is never mentioned but it's \"DeVito\" in the closing credits. Played by Joe Pesci, Tommy is shown as a small man with a violent temper and as being somewhat older than Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)—when Tommy and Henry first meet, they're both teenagers. In reality, DiSimone stood over six feet tall and was several years younger than Henry, disappearing when he was only 29 years old. When Tommy, Henry, and Jimmy (Robert De Niro), were on their way to bury Billy Batts (Frank Vincent), Tommy was driving, not Henry. It was Tuddy (Frank DiLeo), not Tommy, who wanted Henry to come with him on the double date. Tommy just vanished, no one knows how he was killed, so the scene where Tommy is actually shot and the line about Tommy's mother not being able to have an open coffin at Tommy's funeral are both fictional and thrown in for dramatic license. The major change in the film adaptation is that Tommy isn't a main character in the book. He is only mentioned in it, but is still regarded as a violent killer. Several of the characters' names were changed for the film, the most notable being Paulie Vario, who became Paul Cicero. Tommy DeSimone was changed to Tommy DeVito, and Jimmy Conway was Jimmy Burke A.K.A. Jimmy Conway-Burke.\n\nThe film also omits Henry's enlistment in the US Army in 1960 where he served for three years. While in the Army he continued to run schemes and made several connections he used after he was discharged."
