Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci), and Henry (Ray Liotta) have a lot in common. They wear expensive suits, make lots of money, and have a thing for beautiful women. They are the so-called ‘goodfellas’ – the happy few who are part of one of the most famous families of New York: the mob. But don’t be deceived by their good manners. It takes very little for hell to break loose.

Comeback to the big screen

After 30 years, the gangster epos Goodfellas returns to the big screen in 4k. This gangster film, a classic and leading film in the genre, was directed 30 years ago by Martin Scorsese and based on the book ‘Wiseguy’ by Pileggi.

Before the film starts, there will be an introduction about the importance of Scorsese as a director and Goodfellas as a film.
