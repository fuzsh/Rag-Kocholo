        "text": "Pacing of Paleozoic macroevolutionary rates by Milankovitch grand cycles.\n\nPubMed\n\nCrampton, James S; Meyers, Stephen R; Cooper, Roger A; Sadler, Peter M; Foote, Michael; Harte, David\n\n2018-05-29\n\nPeriodic fluctuations in past biodiversity, speciation, and extinction have been proposed, with extremely long periods ranging from 26 to 62 million years, although forcing mechanisms remain speculative. In contrast, well-understood periodic Milankovitch climate forcing represents a viable driver for macroevolutionary fluctuations, although little evidence for such fluctuation exists except during the Late Cenozoic. The reality, magnitude, and drivers of periodic fluctuations in macroevolutionary rates are of interest given long-standing debate surrounding the relative roles of intrinsic biotic interactions vs. extrinsic environmental factors as drivers of biodiversity change. Here, we show that, over a time span of 60 million years, between 9 and 16% of the variance in biological turnover (i.e., speciation probability plus species extinction probability) in a major Early Paleozoic zooplankton group, the graptoloids, can be explained by long-period astronomical cycles (Milankovitch \"grand cycles\") associated with Earth's orbital eccentricity (2.6 million years) and obliquity (1.3 million years). These grand cycles modulate climate variability, alternating times of relative stability in the environment with times of maximum volatility. We infer that these cycles influenced graptolite speciation and extinction through climate-driven changes to oceanic circulation and structure. Our results confirm the existence of Milankovitch grand cycles in the Early Paleozoic Era and show that known processes related to the mechanics of the Solar System were shaping marine macroevolutionary rates comparatively early in the history of complex life. We present an application of hidden Markov models to macroevolutionary time series and protocols for the evaluation of statistical significance in spectral analysis.\n\nTime-calibrated Milankovitch cycles for the late Permian.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Huaichun; Zhang, Shihong; Hinnov, Linda A; Jiang, Ganqing; Feng, Qinglai; Li, Haiyan; Yang, Tianshui\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAn important innovation in the geosciences is the astronomical time scale. The astronomical time scale is based on the Milankovitch-forced stratigraphy that has been calibrated to astronomical models of paleoclimate forcing; it is defined for much of Cenozoic-Mesozoic. For the Palaeozoic era, however, astronomical forcing has not been widely explored because of lack of high-precision geochronology or astronomical modelling. Here we report Milankovitch cycles from late Permian (Lopingian) strata at Meishan and Shangsi, South China, time calibrated by recent high-precision U-Pb dating. The evidence extends empirical knowledge of Earth's astronomical parameters before 250 million years ago. Observed obliquity and precession terms support a 22-h length-of-day. The reconstructed astronomical time scale indicates a 7.793-million year duration for the Lopingian epoch, when strong 405-kyr cycles constrain astronomical modelling. This is the first significant advance in defining the Palaeozoic astronomical time scale, anchored to absolute time, bridging the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition.\n\nA method for the division of the conglomerate depositional cycle under Milankovitch cycles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Panpan; Fang, Nianqiao; Li, Cunlei; Liu, Jianmei\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe conglomerate layer at the upper section of the 4th member of the Shahejie formation ({{{{S}}}4}{{u}}) of the Yongan district at the Donying depression is a well-developed sedimentation of several periods. It lacks stable muddy layers and sophisticated classification of the sedimentation periods and the proportion of sedimentary layering in each period has long been a difficult task for geologists. In addressing this problem, this paper attempts to introduce the theory of climatic cycles driven by astronomical periods from astronomical stratigraphy on the basis of the characteristics of the sedimentation under the turbidity current in the region of study. Through studying the conditions for the formation of the conglomerate layer and the factors of control, we pinpoint the formation of the layer in chronology and differentiate the cycle interface and correlation in the same formation period. Milankovitch analysis is conducted on the sedimentation of the conglomerate layer in the region of study to determine if the stratigraphy cycle of the region is primarily controlled by the eccentricity cycle and calculate MSC1 and MSC2 thicknesses of 189.3 m and 78.05 m, respectively. Milankovitch theory is the primary tool used in the analysis, in conjunction with petrographic analysis. The stratum at the {{{{S}}}4}{{u}} is classified into four IV-grade sequences and 11 V-grade sequences. The information on the dominant cycle frequency is used for wave filtering of the well logs and to determine the significant Milankovitch wave log. With the data from this curve, we may compare the stratigraphy cycle with the characteristics of the standard cycle and classify and compare the sedimentation periods of the conglomerate layers in further detail.\n\nA 3D Visualization and Analysis Model of the Earth Orbit, Milankovitch Cycles and Insolation.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKostadinov, Tihomir; Gilb, Roy\n\n2013-04-01\n\nMilankovitch theory postulates that periodic variability of Earth's orbital elements is a major climate forcing mechanism. Although controversies remain, ample geologic evidence supports the major role of the Milankovitch cycles in climate, e.g. glacial-interglacial cycles. There are three Milankovitch orbital parameters: orbital eccentricity (main periodicities of ~100,000 and ~400,000 years), precession (quantified as the longitude of perihelion, main periodicities 19,000-24,000 years) and obliquity of the ecliptic (Earth's axial tilt, main periodicity 41,000 years). The combination of these parameters controls the spatio-temporal patterns of incoming solar radiation (insolation) and the timing of the seasons with respect to perihelion, as well as season duration. The complex interplay of the Milankovitch orbital parameters on various time scales makes assessment and visualization of Earth's orbit and insolation variability challenging. It is difficult to appreciate the pivotal importance of Kepler's laws of planetary motion in controlling the effects of Milankovitch cycles on insolation patterns. These factors also make Earth-Sun geometry and Milankovitch theory difficult to teach effectively. Here, an astronomically precise and accurate Earth orbit visualization model is presented. The model offers 3D visualizations of Earth's orbital geometry, Milankovitch parameters and the ensuing insolation forcings. Both research and educational uses are envisioned for the model, which is developed in MatlabÂ® as a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). We present the user with a choice between the Berger et al. (1978) and Laskar et al. (2004) astronomical solutions for eccentricity, obliquity and precession. A \"demo\" mode is also available, which allows the three Milankovitch parameters to be varied independently of each other (and over much larger ranges than the naturally occurring ones), so the user can isolate the effects of each parameter on orbital geometry\n\nMilankovitch and sub-Milankovitch cycles of the Early Triassic Daye Formation, South China and their geochronological and paleoclimatic implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, H.; Zhang, S.; Feng, Q.; Jiang, G.; Li, H.; Yang, T.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe most profound mass extinction in the Phanerozoic occurred at the end of the Permian, with global loss of nearly 90% of marine invertebrate species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate genera. Recent studies suggested that volcanisms represented by the Siberian Trap were most likely cause of the end-Permian extinction. The post-extinction periods in the Early Triassic was characterized by low biodiversity, reduced abundance and size of invertebrates, hiatus in coal deposition, anomalously high sediment fluxes, and large perturbations of the carbon cycle, which have been interpreted as the consequence of persistently unfavorable environmental conditions. However, the time framework for the Early Triassic geological, biological and geochemical events is traditionally established by conodont biostratigraphy, but the absolute duration of condont biozones are not well constrained. In this study, a rock magnetic cyclostratigraphy, based on high-resolution analysis (2440 samples) of magnetic susceptibility (MS) and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) intensity variations, was developed for the 55.1-m-thick, Early Triassic Daye Formation at the Daxiakou section, Hubei province in South China. The Daye Formation shows exceptionally well-preserved lithological cycles with alternations of thin-bedded mudstone, marl and limestone, which are closely tracked by the MS and ARM variations. Power spectral, wavelet and amplitude modulation (AM) analysis of the ARM and MS series reveal strong evidence for the presence of Milankovitch to sub-Milankovitch frequencies dominated by precession index signal and 4-5 ka cycles. Cycles expressed by variations in MS and ARM were likely controlled by the input of fine-grained detrital magnetite, which in turn may be driven by astronomically induced changes in monsoon intensity in the equatorial eastern Tethys during the Early Triassic greenhouse period. On the basis of the 100-ka tuning results, the astronomically constrained duration of\n\nMilankovitch wobble?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMitchell, R. N.; Thissen, C.; Kirschvink, J. L.; Schrag, D. P.; Montanari, A.; Coccioni, R.; Slotznick, S. P.; Yamazaki, T.; Penserini, B. D.; Abrahams, J. N. H.; Cruz-Heredia, M.; Evans, D. A.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nHigh-resolution paleomagnetism of Cretaceous-aged limestone in Italy reveals evidence for a previously unrecognized ~10Ë directional variation, or \"wobble\", of either the geographic or magnetic pole on a 106-year, \"Milankovitch\" time scale. Ten ~1 million year (Myr) wobbles of magnetic inclination can be identified and correlated across Italy from 87-74 Myr ago, potentially refining the global polarity time scale and seafloor spreading rates. Milankovitch wobble is an omnipresent geophysical process that represents, irrespective of its mechanism, a new chronometer for age calibration with paleomagnetism. If Milankovitch wobble is interpreted as a geomagnetic artifactâthe long-considered but still unproven idea that astronomical variations influence the geodynamoâthe geocentric-axial dipole hypothesis would only be viable when averaged over time scales 100 times greater than currently thought, making present-day geocentricity largely coincidental. If interpreted as true geographic change, Milankovitch wobble implies an unrecognized, rapid time scale (~10Ë Myr-1) of true polar wander, possibly due to ice sheet dynamics driven by the 1.2 Myr modulation of Earth's rotational obliquity. Stable isotope data co-vary with the Milankovitch wobble, possibly favoring the polar wander mechanism that predicts rapid environmental change where the geomagnetic artifact hypothesis does not.\n\nProterozoic Milankovitch cycles and the history of the solar system.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeyers, Stephen R; Malinverno, Alberto\n\n2018-06-19\n\nThe geologic record of Milankovitch climate cycles provides a rich conceptual and temporal framework for evaluating Earth system evolution, bestowing a sharp lens through which to view our planet's history. However, the utility of these cycles for constraining the early Earth system is hindered by seemingly insurmountable uncertainties in our knowledge of solar system behavior (including Earth-Moon history), and poor temporal control for validation of cycle periods (e.g., from radioisotopic dates). Here we address these problems using a Bayesian inversion approach to quantitatively link astronomical theory with geologic observation, allowing a reconstruction of Proterozoic astronomical cycles, fundamental frequencies of the solar system, the precession constant, and the underlying geologic timescale, directly from stratigraphic data. Application of the approach to 1.4-billion-year-old rhythmites indicates a precession constant of 85.79 Â± 2.72 arcsec/year (2Ï), an Earth-Moon distance of 340,900 Â± 2,600 km (2Ï), and length of day of 18.68 Â± 0.25 hours (2Ï), with dominant climatic precession cycles of â¼14 ky and eccentricity cycles of â¼131 ky. The results confirm reduced tidal dissipation in the Proterozoic. A complementary analysis of Eocene rhythmites (â¼55 Ma) illustrates how the approach offers a means to map out ancient solar system behavior and Earth-Moon history using the geologic archive. The method also provides robust quantitative uncertainties on the eccentricity and climatic precession periods, and derived astronomical timescales. As a consequence, the temporal resolution of ancient Earth system processes is enhanced, and our knowledge of early solar system dynamics is greatly improved.\n\nTesting competing forms of the Milankovitch hypothesis: A multivariate approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaufmann, Robert K.; Juselius, Katarina\n\n2016-02-01\n\nWe test competing forms of the Milankovitch hypothesis by estimating the coefficients and diagnostic statistics for a cointegrated vector autoregressive model that includes 10 climate variables and four exogenous variables for solar insolation. The estimates are consistent with the physical mechanisms postulated to drive glacial cycles. They show that the climate variables are driven partly by solar insolation, determining the timing and magnitude of glaciations and terminations, and partly by internal feedback dynamics, pushing the climate variables away from equilibrium. We argue that the latter is consistent with a weak form of the Milankovitch hypothesis and that it should be restated as follows: internal climate dynamics impose perturbations on glacial cycles that are driven by solar insolation. Our results show that these perturbations are likely caused by slow adjustment between land ice volume and solar insolation. The estimated adjustment dynamics show that solar insolation affects an array of climate variables other than ice volume, each at a unique rate. This implies that previous efforts to test the strong form of the Milankovitch hypothesis by examining the relationship between solar insolation and a single climate variable are likely to suffer from omitted variable bias.\n\nSeafloor Age-Stacking Reveals No Evidence for Milankovitch Cycle Influence on Abyssal Hills at Intermediate, Fast and Super-Fast Spreading Rates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGoff, J.; Zahirovic, S.; MÃ¼ller, D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nRecently published spectral analyses of seafloor bathymetry concluded that abyssal hills, highly linear ridges that are formed along seafloor spreading centers, exhibit periodicities that correspond to Milankovitch cycles - variations in Earth's orbit that affect climate on periods of 23, 41 and 100 thousand years. These studies argue that this correspondence could be explained by modulation of volcanic output at the mid-ocean ridge due to lithostatic pressure variations associated with rising and falling sea level. If true, then the implications are substantial: mapping the topography of the seafloor with sonar could be used as a way to investigate past climate change. This \"Milankovitch cycle\" hypothesis predicts that the rise and fall of abyssal hills will be correlated to crustal age, which can be tested by stacking, or averaging, bathymetry as a function of age; stacking will enhance any age-dependent signal while suppressing random components, such as fault-generated topography. We apply age-stacking to data flanking the Southeast Indian Ridge ( 3.6 cm/yr half rate), northern East Pacific Rise ( 5.4 cm/yr half rate) and southern East Pacific Rise ( 7.8 cm/yr half rate), where multibeam bathymetric coverage is extensive on the ridge flanks. At the greatest precision possible given magnetic anomaly data coverage, we have revised digital crustal age models in these regions with updated axis and magnetic anomaly traces. We also utilize known 2nd-order spatial statistical properties of abyssal hills to predict the variability of the age-stack under the null hypothesis that abyssal hills are entirely random with respect to crustal age; the age-stacked profile is significantly different from zero only if it exceeds this expected variability by a large margin. Our results indicate, however, that the null hypothesis satisfactorily explains the age-stacking results in all three regions of study, thus providing no support for the Milankovitch cycle hypothesis. The\n\nAbiotic and biotic responses to Milankovitch-forced megamonsoon and glacial cycles recorded in South China at the end of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFang, Qiang; Wu, Huaichun; Hinnov, Linda A.; Tian, Wenqian; Wang, Xunlian; Yang, Tianshui; Li, Haiyan; Zhang, Shihong\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAt the end of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) from late Early Permian to early Late Permian, the global climate was impacted by a prevailing megamonsoon and Gondwanan deglaciation. To better understand the abiotic and biotic responses to Milankovitch-forced climate changes during this time period, multi-element X-ray fluorescence (XRF) geochemistry analyses were conducted on 948 samples from the late Early-late Middle Permian Maokou Formation at Shangsi, South China. The Fe/Ti, S/Ti, Ba/Ti and Ca time series, which were calibrated with an existing \"floating\" astronomical time scale (ATS), show the entire suite of Milankovitch rhythms including 405 kyr long eccentricity, 128 and 95 kyr short eccentricity, 33 kyr obliquity and 20 kyr precession. Spectral coherency and cross-phase analysis reveals that chemical weathering (monitored by Fe/Ti) and upwelling (captured by S/Ti and Ba/Ti) are nearly antiphase in the precession band, which suggests a contrast between summer and winter monsoon intensities. Strong obliquity signal in the Ba/Ti series is proposed to derive from changes in thermohaline circulation intensity from glaciation dynamics in southern Gondwana. The abundance of foraminifer, brachiopod and ostracod faunas within the Maokou Formation were mainly controlled by the 1.1 Myr obliquity modulation cycle. The obliquity-forced high-nutrient and oxygen-depleted conditions generally produced a benthic foraminifer bloom, but threatened the brachiopod and ostracod faunas.\n\nMilankovitch Modulated Eocene Growth Strata From the Jaca Piggyback Basin, Spanish Pyrenees\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnastasio, D. J.; Hinnov, L. A.; Newton, M. L.; Kodama, K. P.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nNew stratigraphic and rock magnetic data from the southern margin of the Jaca basin, Spanish Pyrenees, shows evidence of Eocene sedimentary cycles modulated by the climatic effects of Milankovitch orbital forcing. Tectonic processes simultaneously controlled larger-scale stratigraphic sequences and overall wedge-top basin development. Within the context of existing magnetostratigraphy, we described 1 km of marine basinal and prodeltaic rocks near Pico del Aguila, a large-scale synsedimentary fold, and collected samples every ~4krs for ~4myrs for lithologic and rock magnetic analysis. In magnetochrons C17r, C18n.1n, and C18n.1r (1.27myrs) anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) variations occur with strong hierarchical bundling patterns suggestive of precession-scale cycles grouped into 100 kyr eccentricity cycles, and \"super bundled\" into 400 kyr eccentricity cycles. This pattern was exploited to construct an \"eccentricity time scale\" for the series producing a minimally tuned time series that is 1.3 myrs in duration; comparing well with the magnetochron calibration. Spectral analysis of this ARM time series shows that the 100-kyr tuning has aligned power into all of the principal orbital frequency bands: long eccentricity (1/(400 kyrs)), obliquity (1/(40.4 kyrs)), long precession (1/(24.4 kyrs)), and short precession (1/(20 kyrs)). Lithologic data, including bed thickness and grain size also shows high frequency periodicity we attribute to precessional forcing. ARM variations may result from climate modulated carbonate production or more likely, variable detrital inputs such as atmospheric dust (varying wind intensity or aridity) or watershed erosion (runoff variation) rather than diagenetic sources. The Milankovitch based chronology within the growth stratigraphy was then used to calculate deformation rates. Tilt rates of 9 degrees / myr for folding are comparable to other studies in which deformation was averaged over more time. We show that Milankovitch\n\nProposed law of nature linking impacts, plume volcanism, and Milankovitch cycles to terrestrial vertebrate mass extinctions via greenhouse-embryo death coupling\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMclean, D. M.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nA greenhouse-physiological coupling killing mechanism active among mammals, birds, and reptiles has been identified. Operating via environmental thermal effects upon the maternal core-skin blood flow critical to the survival and development of embryos, it reduces the flow of blood to the uterine tract. Today, during hot summers, this phenomena kills embryos on a vast, global scale. Because of sensitivity of many mammals to modern heat, a major modern greenhouse could reduce population numbers on a global scale, and potentially trigger population collapses in the more vulnerable parts of the world. In the geological past, the killing mechanism has likely been triggered into action by greenhouse warming via impact events, plume volcanism, and Earth orbital variations (Milankovitch cycles). Earth's biosphere is maintained and molded by the flow of energy from the solar energy source to Earth and on to the space energy sink (SES). This SES energy flow maintains Earth's biosphere and its living components, as open, intermediate, dissipative, nonequilibrium systems whose states are dependent upon the rate of energy flowing through them. Greenhouse gases such as CO2 in the atmosphere influence the SES energy flow rate. Steady-state flow is necessary for global ecological stability (autopoiesis). Natural fluctuations of the C cycle such as rapid releases of CO2 from the mantle, or oceans, disrupt steady-state SES flow. These fluctuations constantly challenge the biosphere; slowdown of SES energy flow drives it toward thermodynamical equilibrium and stagnation. Fluctuations induced by impact event, mantle plume volcanism, and Milankovitch cycles can grow into structure-breaking waves triggering major perturbations of Earth's C cycle and mass extinctions. A major C cycle perturbation involves readjustment of the outer physiochemical spheres of the Earth: the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere; and by necessity, the biosphere. A greenhouse, one manifestation of a major\n\nThe Upstream and Downstream impact of Milankovitch cycles in continental nonmarine sedimentary records\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nValero, Luis; GarcÃ©s, Miguel; Huerta, Pedro; Cabrera, LluÃ­s\n\n2016-04-01\n\nDiscerning the effects of climate in the stratigraphic record is crucial for the comprehension of past climate changes. The signature of climate in sedimentary sequences is often assessed by the identification of Milankovitch cycles, as they can be recognized due to their (quasi) periodic behaviour. The integration of diverse stratigraphic disciplines is required in order to understand the different processes involved in the expression of the orbital cycles in the sedimentary records. New advances in Stratigraphy disclose the different variables that affect the sedimentation along the sediment routing systems. These variables can be summarized as the relationship between accommodation and sediment supply (AS/SS), because they account for the shifts of the total mass balance of a basin. Based in these indicators we propose a synthetic model for the understanding of the expression of climate in continental basins. Sedimentation in internally drained lake basins is particularly sensitive to net precipitation/evaporation variations. Rapid base level oscillations modify the AS/SS ratio sufficiently as to mask possible sediment flux variations associated to the changing discharge. On the other hand, basins lacking a central lacustrine system do not experience climatically-driven accommodation changes, and thus are more sensitive to archive sediment pulses. Small basins lacking carbonate facies are the ideal candidates to archive the impact of orbital forcing in the landscapes, as their small-scale sediment transfer systems are unable to buffer the upstream signal. Sedimentation models that include the relationship between accommodation and sediment supply, the effects of density and type of vegetation, and its coupled response with climate are needed to enhance their reliability.\n\nMilankovitch Modulation of the Ecosystem Dynamics of Fossil Great Lakes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWhiteside, J. H.; Olsen, P. E.; Eglinton, T. I.; Cornet, B.; Huber, P.; McDonald, N. G.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTriassic and Early Jurassic lacustrine deposits of eastern North American rift basins preserve a spectacular record of precession-related Milankovitch forcing in the Pangean tropics. The abundant and well-preserved fossil fish assemblages from these great lakes demonstrate a sequence of cyclical changes that track the permeating hierarchy of climatic cycles. To detail ecosystem processes correlating with succession of fish communities, we measured bulk Î´13Corg through a 100 ky series of Early Jurassic climatic precession-forced lake level cycles in the lower Shuttle Meadow Formation of the Hartford rift basin, CT. The deep-water phase of one of these cycles, the Bluff Head bed, has produced thousands of articulated fish. We observe fluctuations in the bulk Î´13Corg of the cyclical strata that reflect differing degrees of lake water stratification, nutrient levels, and relative proportion of algal vs. plant derived organic matter that trace fish community changes. We can exclude extrinsic changes in the global exchangeable reservoirs as an origin of this variability because molecule-level Î´13C of n-alkanes of plant leaf waxes from the same strata show no such variability. While at higher taxonomic levels the fish communities responded largely by sorting of taxa by environmental forcing, at the species level the holostean genus Semionotus responded by in situ evolution, and ultimately extinction, of a species flock. Fluctuations at the higher frequency, climatic precessional scale are mirrored at lower frequency, eccentricity modulated, scales, all following the lake-level hierarchical pattern. Thus, lacustrine isotopic ratios amplify the Milankovitch climate signal that was already intensified by sequelae of the end-Triassic extinctions. The degree to which the ecological structure of modern lakes responds to similar environmental cyclicity is largely unknown, but we suspect similar patterns and processes within the Neogene history of the East African great lakes\n\nGeophysical and topographic expression of early Mesozoic grand cycles of the Milankovitch band\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOlsen, P. E.; Reynolds, D. J.; Goldberg, D.; Kent, D. V.; Whiteside, J. H.\n\n2012-12-01\n\n/1.8m.y. (g4-g3) cycles can be clearly seen as the most coherent components of the seismic profiles across the basin (6). The topographic expression of the deeply eroded tilted strata of the Newark basin section also reveals the grand cycles which can be seen from space, with ridges reflecting time intervals of high- and valleys low-precessional variability that can be directly tied to the stratigraphy, much as bundles of plausibly obliquity-related rhythms can be seen in crater walls on Mars (7). All of these ways of observing the grand cycles of the Milankovitch band reflect their importance as major features of the sedimentary record and are complementary means to detect and empirically map the chaotic evolution of the solar system.

These elements are closely related to the two vectorial first integrals of the unperturbed two-body problem; namely, the angular momentum vector and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. After a detailed historical discussion of the origin and development of such elements, nonsingular equations for the time variations of these sets of elements under perturbations are established, both in Lagrangian and Gaussian form. After averaging, a compact, elegant, and symmetrical form of secular Milankovitch-like equations is obtained, which reminds of the structure of canonical systems of equations in Hamiltonian mechanics. As an application of this vectorial formulation, we analyze the motion of an object orbiting about a planet (idealized as a point mass moving in a heliocentric elliptical orbit) and subject to solar radiation pressure acceleration (obeying an inverse-square law). We show that the corresponding secular problem is integrable and we give an explicit closed-form solution.\n\nA response to \"Milankovitch theory viewed from Devils Hole\" by J. Imbrie, A.C. Mix and D.G. Martinson\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWinograd, I.J.; Landwehr, J.M.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe detailed and well-dated 500,000-yr record of oxygen-18 variations found in vein calcite core DH-11 taken from Devils Hole in Nevada provides several challenges to the Milankovitch theory for the occurrence of Quaternary glaciations. A recent discussion paper (Imbrie and others, 1993) has dismissed the relevance of this well-dated core for determining the timing of global climatic fluctuations and, moreover, asserts that the Devils Hole record provides support for the Milankovitch theory. Upon analysis of the arguments found in this discussion, the authors found nothing to dissuade them from the original conclusion that the Devils Hole chronology does present a serious challenge to the Milankovitch theory.\n\nMilankovitch cyclicity in the paleotropical, fluvial, Late Triassic age strata recovered by the Colorado Plateau Coring Project (CPCP)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOlsen, P. E.; Mundil, R.; Kent, D.; Rasmussen, C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTwo questions addressed by the CPCP are: 1) is Milankovitch-paced climate cyclicity recorded in the fluvial Late Triassic age Chinle Formation ( 227-202 Ma); and 2) do geochronological data from the Chinle support the Newark-Hartford astrochronological polarity time scale (1) (APTS). To these ends we examined the upper 157 m (stratigraphic thickness) of Petrified Forest National Park core 1A (Owl Rock, Petrified Forest, and upper Sonsela members), consisting mostly of massive red paleosols and less important fluvial sandstones. A linear age model tied to new U-Pb zircon CA ID-TIMS dates from core 1A, consistent with published data from outcrop (2), yields a duration of about 5 Myr for this interval. Magnetic susceptibility variations, interpreted as reflecting penecontemporaneous soil and sandstone redox conditions, show a clear 12 m cycle corresponding to a 400 kyr cycle based on Fourier analysis in both core and hole. Similar cyclicity is apparent in spectrophotometric data, largely reflecting hematite variability. Weak, higher frequency cycles are present consistent with 100 kyr variability. There is no interpretable 20 kyr signal. Such cyclicity is not an anticipated direct effect of Milankvitch insolation variations, but must reflect non-linear integration of variability that changes dramatically at the eccentricity-scale, brought about by the sedimentary and climate systems. Our results support a direct 405 kyr-level correlation between the fluvial medial Chinle and lacustrine Newark Basin section (middle Passaic Formation), consistent with new and published (3) paleomagnetic polarity stratigraphy from the Chinle, showing that the Milankovitch eccentricity cycles are recorded in lower accumulation rate fluvial systems.

M.; Scher, H.; Kirtland Turner, S.; Ridgwell, A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe pace of Earth's background climate variability is known to be driven by the Milankovitch cycles, variations in Earth's orbital parameters and axial tilt. While the Milankovitch (orbital) theory of climate change is very nearly universally accepted, the climate system mechanisms and feedbacks responsible for amplifying orbital cycles preserved in the geologic record remain uncertain. For the late Pleistocene, the ice core-derived record of atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) is strongly coupled with global temperature on orbital time scales, indicating that internal feedbacks involving the carbon cycle amplify or even cause the large changes in global temperature during orbitally driven glacial-interglacial cycles. However, for earlier time periods beyond the range of ice cores (the last 800 kyr), it is not possible to directly compare records of pCO2 to orbital climate cycles because there are no high-resolution (orbitally resolved) records of pCO2 before the Pliocene. We address this deficiency with a high-resolution ( 5-10 kyr spacing) record of planktonic foraminiferal d11B-derived surface seawater pH (as well as d13C and trace metal analyses) over a 500 kyr time window in a sedimentary record with known Milankovitch-scale climate and carbon cycle oscillations: the Middle Miocene (14.0 - 14.5 Ma) at ODP Site 926 (subtropical North Atlantic). The resulting pH record can be used to constrain atmospheric pCO2, allowing comparison of the timescale and magnitude of carbon cycle changes during a period of eccentricity-dominated variability in the response of the global climate system (the Late Pleistocene) with a period of obliquity-dominance (the middle Miocene). These new records of planktic d11B and d13C will then be used to guide simulations of astronomical climate forcing in Earth System models, resulting in refined estimates of pCO2 changes over orbital cycles and providing quantitative constraints on the mechanisms and feedbacks responsible for the\n\nMilankovitch forcing and role of Indonesian Gateway on middle Miocene climate and carbon cycle: New perspective from the South China Sea, equatorial West Pacific and East Indian Ocean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolbourn, A.; Kuhnt, W.; Schulz, M.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nThe enigmatic long-term positive carbon isotope excursion (\"Monterey excursion\") in the middle Miocene exhibits an apparent 400 ky cyclicity (long eccentricity cycle of the Milankovitch frequency band). Similar isotope excursion are known from the mid-Cretaceous and may be a characteristic feature of a greenhouse world with extreme warm climate, high sealevel, and a dominantly zonal circulation pattern in the world ocean. This period of extreme warmth (the mid-Miocene climate optimum) ended between 14.2 and 13.8 Ma, when a significant increase in deep-water oxygen isotopic values occurred that was related to the growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet. Plate tectonic movements between Australia and SE Asia, ultimately leading to the closure of the deep water gateway connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans, started prior to this paleoceanographic change. We used benthic deep water oxygen and carbon isotope curves in combination with new age models at critical locations along the northern margin of the Indonesian Gateway (South China Sea, ODP Site 1146), at the western end of the gateway (NW Australian margin, ODP Site 761) and at the eastern end of the gateway (Ontong Java Plateau, ODP Site 806) to investigate the frequency and amplitude of deep water isotope fluctuations during the middle Miocene. High resolution sediment color reflectance data, benthic carbon isotopes and foraminiferal assemblages are used as proxies of deep-water ventilation and carbon flux. Our results indicate Milankovitch forcing on virtually all proxies and a change from eccentricity to precession driven cyclicity at approximately 15 Ma. Our data reveal increased carbon flux and a restricted deep water exchange between the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Gateway during the middle Miocene climate optimum. After 13.6 Ma, the decrease in d13C was strongest at Site 806, indicating a marked change in the deep-water circulation of the equatorial West Pacific and a switch to a\n\nPlanetary Hypothesis, sub-Milankovitch frequencies and Holocene cold events\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCompagnucci, R. H.; Cionco, R. G.; Agosta, E.; Wanner, H.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe Planetary Hypothesis of solar cycles proposes that the movement of the Sun around the solar system barycenter modulates the solar cycles at several times scales. Using a 3-D model of the solar system (Cionco and Compagnucci, 2012) we derived the solar barycentric motion and various dynamic parameters such as the angular momentum (L= Lx, Ly, Lz) for the Holocene. Angular momentum inversions are sporadic and important events in the dynamics of the MSB: Lz becomes negative and giant planets are nearly aligned. These episodes are related to some grand solar grand minima such as Maunder and Dalton, and also to the recent deep minimum 2007-2010 which was preceded by a Lz inversion in 1990. During the Holocene several negative Lz episodes occur that are grouped in approximately millennia to centuries long periods. Each group is separated by ~2000 years where the Lz values remain positive, both generating a cycle between 1500 and 2500 years. The spectral analysis shows significant peaks at sub-Milankovitch frequencies. Furthermore, the analysis of the spatiotemporal variability of temperature defined six specific cold events (8200, 6300, 4700, 2700, 1550 and 550 years BP) during the Holocene (Wanner et al, 2011). During, and /or before, of these major climates cooling, a group of negative Lz episodes were presented. Oppositely the resulted during the warms periods were the lack of the angular movement inversion together with the extremes of positive Lz . Therefore, the origin of Holocene cold events seems to be linked to the gravitational influence of the planets, that is to say the planetary torque that has a non-negligible effect on the causes of the solar magnetic cycle.

These investigations demonstrated that subseafloor microbes are unevenly distributed and that cell abundances and metabolic activities are often independent from sediment depths, with increased prokaryotic activity at geochemical and/or sedimentary interfaces. In this study we demonstrate that microbial populations vary at the scale of individual beds in the biogenic oozes of a drill site in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Ocean Drilling Program Leg 201, Site 1226). We relate bedding-scale changes in biogenic ooze sediment composition to organic carbon (OC) and microbial cell concentrations using high-resolution color reflectance data as proxy for lithology. Our analyses demonstrate that microbial concentrations are an order of magnitude higher in the more organic-rich diatom oozes than in the nannofossil oozes. The variations mimic small-scale variations in diatom abundance and OC, indicating that the modern distribution of microbial biomass is ultimately controlled by Milankovitch-frequency variations in past oceanographic conditions. ?? 2010 Geological Society of America.\n\nA conceptual model for glacial cycles and the middle Pleistocene transition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDaruka, IstvÃ¡n; Ditlevsen, Peter D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMilankovitch's astronomical theory of glacial cycles, attributing ice age climate oscillations to orbital changes in Northern-Hemisphere insolation, is challenged by the paleoclimatic record. The climatic response to the variations in insolation is far from trivial. In general the glacial cycles are highly asymmetric in time, with slow cooling from the interglacials to the glacials (inceptions) and very rapid warming from the glacials to the interglacials (terminations). We shall refer to this fast-slow dynamics as the \"saw-tooth\" shape of the paleoclimatic record. This is non-linearly related to the time-symmetric variations in the orbital forcing. However, the most pronounced challenge to the Milankovitch theory is the middle Pleistocene transition (MPT) occurring about one million years ago. During that event, the prevailing 41 kyr glacial cycles, corresponding to the almost harmonic obliquity cycle were replaced by longer saw-tooth shaped cycles with a time-scale around 100 kyr. The MPT must have been driven by internal changes in climate response, since it does not correspond to any apparent changes in the orbital forcing. In order to identify possible mechanisms causing the observed changes in glacial dynamics, it is relevant to study simplified models with the capability of generating temporal behavior similar to the observed records. We present a simple oscillator type model approach, with two variables, a temperature anomaly and a climatic memory term. The generalization of the ice albedo feedback is included in terms of an effective multiplicative coupling between this latter climatic memory term (representing the internal degrees of freedom) and the external drive. The simple model reproduces the temporal asymmetry of the late Pleistocene glacial cycles and suggests that the MPT can be explained as a regime shift, aided by climatic noise, from a period 1 frequency locking to the obliquity cycle to a period 2-3 frequency locking to the same obliquity\n\nMilankovitch climate cyclicity and its effect on relative sea level changes and organic carbon storage, Late Cretaceous black shales of Colombia and Venezuela\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVillamil, T.; Kauffman, E.G.\n\n1993-02-01\n\nThe Late Cretaceous Villeta Group and La Luna Formation shows remarkable depositional cyclicity attributable to Milankovitch climate cycles. Each 30-60 cm thick hemicycle is composed of a basal gray shale, a medial black, organic-rich shale, and an upper gray shale with a dense argillaceous limestone cap. Fourier time-series analysis revealed peak frequencies of 500, 100, and 31 ka (blending 21 and 42 ka data). ThiS cyclicity reflects possibly wet cooler (shale) to dry, possibly warm (limestone) climatic changes and their influence on relative sea level, sedimentation rates/patterns, productivity, water chemistry and stratification. Wet/cool hemicycles may produce slight lowering of sealevel,moreÂ Â» increased rates of clay sedimentation, diminished carbonate production, water stratification, increased productivity among noncalcareous marine plankton, and increased Corg production and storage. Dry/warm hemicycles may produce a slight rise in sealevel, and return to normal marine conditions with low Corg storage. Source rock quality may depend upon the predominance of wet over dry climatic phases. Differences between climate-forced cyclicity and random facies repetition, are shown by contrasting observed lithological patterns and geochemical signals with litho- and chemostratigraphy generated from random models. Accomodation space plots (Fischer plots) for cyclically interbedded black shale-pelagic limestone sequences, allowed prediction of facies behavior, shoreline architecture, and quantitative analysis of relative sea level. The synchroneity of Milankovitch cycles and changes in hemicycle stacking patterns, were tested against a new high-resolution event-chronostratigraphic and biostratigraphic framework for NW South America. Geochemical spikes and hemicycle stacking patterns occur consistently throughout the sections measured, supporting the correlation potential of cyclostratigraphy.Â«Â less\n\nSub-Milankovitch millennial-scale climate variability in Middle Eocene deep-marine sediments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScotchman, J. I.; Pickering, K. T.; Robinson, S. A.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nSub-Milankovitch millennial scale climate variability appears ubiquitous throughout the Quaternary and Pleistocene palaeoenvironmental records (e.g. McManus et al., 1999) yet the driving mechanism remains elusive. Possible mechanisms are generally linked to Quaternary-specific oceanic and cryospheric conditions (e.g. Maslin et al., 2001). An alternative external control, such as solar forcing, however, remains a compelling alternative hypothesis (e.g. Bond et al., 2001). This would imply that millennial-scale cycles are an intrinsic part of the Earthâs climatic system and not restricted to any specific period of time. Determining which of these hypotheses is correct impacts on our understanding of the climate system and its role as a driver of cyclic sedimentation during both icehouse and greenhouse climates. Here we show that Middle Eocene, laminated deep-marine sediments deposited in the Ainsa Basin, Spanish Pyrenees, contain 1,565-year (469 mm) cycles modulated by a 7,141-year (2157 mm) period. Climatic oscillations of 1,565-years recorded by element/Al ratios, are interpreted as representing climatically driven variation in sediment supply (terrigenous run-off) to the Ainsa basin. Climatic oscillations with this period are comparable to Quaternary Bond (~1,500-year), Dansgaard-Oeschger (~1,470-year) and Heinrich (~7,200-year) climatic events. Recognition of similar millennial-scale oscillations in the greenhouse climate of the Middle Eocene would appear inconsistent with an origin dependent upon Quaternary-specific conditions. Our observations lend support for pervasive millennial-scale climatic variability present throughout geologic time likely driven by an external forcing mechanism such as solar forcing.

Nonetheless, these small variations influence Earthâs ice ages. For exoplanets, however, variations can be significantly larger. Previous studies of the habitability of moonless Earth-like exoplanets have found that high obliquities, high eccentricities, and dynamical variations can extend the outer edge of the habitable zone by preventing runaway glaciation (snowball states). We expand upon these studies by exploring the orbital dynamics with a semianalytic model that allows us to map broad regions of parameter space. We find that, in general, the largest drivers of obliquity variations are secular spinâorbit resonances. We show how the obliquity varies in several test cases, including Kepler-62 f, across a wide range of orbital and spin parameters. These obliquity variations, alongside orbital variations, will have a dramatic impact on the climates of such planets.\n\nSequence stratigraphy and high-frequency cycles: New aspects for a quantitative evaluation of the Gulf of Suez basin, Egypt\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNio, S.D.; Yang, C.S.; Tewfik, N.\n\n1993-09-01\n\nA new development in the application of sequence stratigraphic concepts in marine as well as continental basins is the recognition of high-frequency cyclic patterns in rock successions in the subsurface. Studies of six wells from the northern, central, and southern parts of the Gulf of Suez show the presence of well-preserved, high-frequency cycles with periodicities similar to the orbitally forced Malankovitch parameters. Subsurface rock successions, third-order sequences, and high-frequency cycles were compared with outcrops. After establishing the biostratigraphic framework for the above-mentioned wells, a sequence analysis was performed. Sequence boundaries and maximum flooding positions in each well were calibrated withmoreÂ Â» the occurrences and evaluation of the high-frequency cycles. It became obvious that there is an intimate relationship between these high-frequency Milankovitch cycles and sequence organization. In addition, a close relationship can be observed in the subsurface as well as in outcrops between high-frequency climatic changes (connected to the Milankovitch cycles) and (litho)facies variability. Quantitative evaluations of each sequence and/or systems tract can be computed with the International Geoservices' cyclicity analysis tool (MILABAR). The results are summarized in a well composite chart, rate (NAR), and ratio of preserved time. In correlations between the wells, an accuracy of 500-100 Ka can be obtained. The quantitative evaluation of the sequence and high-frequency cycle analysis gave some new aspects concerning the (litho)facies and geodynamic development during the pre- as well as the synrift stages of the Gulf of Suez Basin.Â«Â less\n\nMilankovitch cycles in an equatorial delta from the Miocene of Borneo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarshall, Nathan; Zeeden, Christian; Hilgen, Frederik; Krijgsman, Wout\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe factors controlling sedimentary cyclicity in deltaic systems are a subject of intense debate, and more research, in different deltaic environments and time periods, is needed to better understand the possible mechanisms. Offshore and Pleistocene case studies are more common than proximal and more ancient, greenhouse-climate examples. Furthermore, many studies lack a (statistical) cyclostratigraphic element. The paleo-Mahakam delta of Eastern Kalimantan, Borneo developed during the globally warm middle Miocene, in an equatorial setting, making it of interest to comprehend cyclic sedimentation in a period of warmer yet rapidly changing climate. In this study, statistical analysis of lithological changes shows that regular sandstone/shale alternations occur in a distinct pattern of cycles with thicknesses of â¼90, â¼30, and â¼17 m. Using independent dating, these thicknesses translate into periods of about 100, 40, and 20 kyr, matching the known periods of Earth's orbital eccentricity, obliquity and precession. The obliquity dominance in the middle interval is markedly similar to that observed in the global marine isotope (benthic Î´18O) and other cyclic proxy records for this time interval. Despite a mismatch in the number of 40 kyr cycles compared to the global record that can be plausibly linked to the major sea-level drop at â¼13.8 Ma and facies shifts, it appears that the proximal setting of the paleo-Mahakam's sedimentation was dominantly controlled by allogenic orbital forcing, probably as a consequence of glacioeustasy. In particular, the observed obliquity dominance at paleo-equatorial latitudes, as seen in other records, highlights the dominance of orbital forcing, and potentially glacioeustatic sea level change, during this crucial period of warmer climate.\n\nThe Sun and climate\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\n,\n\n2000-01-01\n\nMany geologic records of climatic and environmental change based on various proxy variables exhibit distinct cyclicities that have been attributed to extraterrestrial forcing. The best known of these are the changes in Earthâs orbital geometry called Milankovitch Cycles, with periodicities of tens to hundreds of thousands of years. However, many cycles seem to have subMilankovitch periodicities, commonly on decadal and centennial scales, similar to those of known solar cycles. A direct connection between solar irradiance (solar constant) and weather and climate has been suggested for more than 100 years but generally rejected by most scientists, who assume that the effect of solar variations would be small. However, recent satellite radiometer measurements and modeling studies indicate that small changes in total solar irradiance could produce global temperature changes of the magnitude suggested for climatic events such as the Little Ice Age (A.D. 1550â1700).\n\nModeling the imprint of Milankovitch cycles on early Pleistocene ice volume\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoychowdhury, R.; DeConto, R.; Pollard, D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGlobal climate during Quaternary and Late Pliocene (present-3.1 Ma) is characterized by alternating glacial and interglacial conditions. Several proposed theories associate these cycles with variations in the Earth's orbital configuration. In this study, we attempt to address the anomalously strong obliquity forcing in the Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene ice volume records (41 kyr world), which stands in sharp contrast to the primary cyclicity of insolation, which is at precessional periods (23 kyr). Model results from GCM simulations show that at low eccentricities (e<0.015), the effect of precession is minimal, and the integrated insolation metrics (such as summer metric, PDD, etc.) vary in-phase between the two hemispheres. At higher eccentricities (e>0.015), precessional response is important, and the insolation metrics vary out-of-phase between the two hemispheres. Using simulations from a GCM-driven ice sheet model, we simulate time continuous ice volume changes from Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Under eccentricities lower than 0.015, ice sheets in both hemispheres respond only to obliquity cycle, and grow and melt together (in-phase). If the ice sheet is simulated with eccentricity higher than 0.015, both hemispheres become more sensitive to precessional variation, and vary out-of-phase with each other, which is consistent with proxy observations from the late Pleistocene glaciations. We use the simulated ice volumes from 2.0 to 1.0 ma to empirically calculate global benthic Î´18O variations based on the assumption that relationships between collapse and growth of ice-sheets and sea level is linear and symmetric and that the isotopic signature of the individual ice-sheets has not changed with time. Our modeled global benthic Î´18O values are broadly consistent with the paleoclimate proxy records such as the LR04 stack.\n\nThe Milankovitch theory and climate sensitivity.

Four climate model versions were implemented to investigate the range of uncertainty in the parameterizations of three basic feedback mechanisms: the ice albedo-temperature, the outgoing long-wave radiation-temperature, and the eddy transport-meridional temperature gradient. It was found that the differences between the simulation of the present climate by the four versions were generally small, especially for annually averaged results. The climate model was also used to study the effect of growing/shrinking of a continental ice sheet, bedrock sinking/uplifting, and sea level changes on the climate system, taking also into account the feedback effects on the climate of the building of the ice caps.\n\nA post-Cassini view of Titan's methane-based hydrologic cycle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHayes, Alexander G.; Lorenz, Ralph D.; Lunine, Jonathan I.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe methane-based hydrologic cycle on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is an extreme analogue to Earth's water cycle. Titan is the only planetary body in the Solar System, other than Earth, that is known to have an active hydrologic cycle. With a surface pressure of 1.5 bar and temperatures of 90 to 95 K, methane and ethane condense out of a nitrogen-based atmosphere and flow as liquids on the moon's surface. Exchange processes between atmospheric, surface and subsurface reservoirs produce methane and ethane cloud systems, as well as erosional and depositional landscapes that have strikingly similar forms to their terrestrial counterparts. Over its 13-year exploration of the Saturn system, the Cassini-Huygens mission revealed that Titan's hydrocarbon-based hydrology is driven by nested methane cycles that operate over a range of timescales, including geologic, orbital (for example, Croll-Milankovitch cycles), seasonal and that of a single convective storm. In this Review Article, we describe the dominant exchange processes that operate over these timescales and present a post-Cassini view of Titan's methane-based hydrologic system.\n\nEvidence for Milankovitch periodicities in Cenomanian-Turonian lithologic and geochemical cycles, western interior U.S.A.\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSageman, B.B.; Rich, J.; Arthur, M.A.; Birchfield, G.E.; Dean, W.E.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe limestone/marlstone bedding couplets of the Bridge Creek Limestone Member, Cenomanian-Turonian Greenhorn Formation, were analyzed by applying spectral techniques to high-resolution lithologic and geochemical data from a core. The results suggest that the Bridge Creek contains a complex record of orbital cyclicity. The dominant signal appears to be obliquity, but signals corresponding to precession and eccentricity were also observed. The development of the bedding couplets is interpreted to have resulted from a combination of factors, including insolation-controlled changes in higher-latitude precipitation leading to dilution/redox cycles, and in lower-latitude evaporation, leading to changes in surface water conditions and productivity cycles in the calcareous plankton. The data interpreted to reflect redox cycles appear to be more strongly influenced by obliquity, and show a weak precessional signal. In contrast, trends in the carbonate record show the opposite response. The complex bedding pattern observed in the Bridge Creek Limestone is interpreted to result from the competing influences of different orbital cycles expressed through different pathways of the depositional system, and was also affected by changes in sedimentation rates related to relative sea level fluctuations, aperiodic dilution by volcanic ash, and changes in organic-matter production and redox conditions related to a global \"oceanic anoxic event\". These factors complicate cycle analysis in the lower part of the member but leave a relatively undisturbed record in the upper Bridge Creek Limestone.

High-frequency sedimentary cycles are observed throughout the Cretaceous section of the Western Interior Seaway. Even though this warm Cretaceous climate suggests an ice-free planet Earth, there has been much debate as to whether the observed high-frequency sedimentary cycles are climate-driven Milankovitch-scale cycles that would suggest glaciers during the Cretaceous Period. This study tests the hypothesis of a glacio-eustatic origin of high-frequency cyclicity in the Turonian Juana Lopez Member of the Mancos Shale in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. Data for this study was obtained from two stratigraphic measured sections which are 3.2 km apart, and located southwest of Shiprock. The two sections are found approximately 60 km away from the Turonian shoreline in an offshore marine environment. A high-resolution thin bed facies analysis on both sections reveals the Juana Lopez to be deposited in a fluvial-dominated, mixed wave- and fluvial-influenced environment. The Juana Lopez is shown to be an overall coarsening-upward sequence, displaying a shallowing regressive environment. Correlations between the two sections reveal 13 correlated parasequences identified through the violation of Walther's Law. An average cyclicity frequency of ca 90 kyr was determined for the sequences by bracketing the Inocermus dimidus and Scaphites whitfieldi biostratigraphic zones within the Juana Lopez sections. This cyclicity represents short eccentricity Milankovitch cycles. Many studies have confirmed that the observed Milankovitch-scaled cyclicity in the Cretaceous must be controlled by glacio-eustasy. With similar Milankovitch cyclicity found in the Juana Lopez, the short eccentricity Milankovitch cycles are interpreted as being glacio-eustatic in origin, which supports the presence of ice in the Cretaceous Period.\n\nMaximum cycle work output optimization for generalized radiative law Otto cycle engines\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXia, Shaojun; Chen, Lingen; Sun, Fengrui\n\n2016-11-01\n\nAn Otto cycle internal combustion engine which includes thermal and friction losses is investigated by finite-time thermodynamics, and the optimization objective is the maximum cycle work output. The thermal energy transfer from the working substance to the cylinder inner wall follows the generalized radiative law (qâÎ (Tn)). Under the condition that all of the fuel consumption, the compression ratio and the cycle period are given, the optimal piston trajectories for both the examples with unlimited and limited accelerations on every stroke are determined, and the cycle-period distribution among all strokes is also optimized. Numerical calculation results for the case of radiative law are provided and compared with those obtained for the cases of Newtonian law and linear phenomenological law. The results indicate that the optimal piston trajectory on each stroke contains three sections, which consist of an original maximum-acceleration and a terminal maximum-deceleration parts; for the case of radiative law, optimizing the piston motion path can achieve an improvement of more than 20% in both the cycle-work output and the second-law efficiency of the Otto cycle compared with the conventional near-sinusoidal operation, and heat transfer mechanisms have both qualitative and quantitative influences on the optimal paths of piston movements.\n\nGeneral phase regularized reconstruction using phase cycling.\n\nPubMed\n\nOng, Frank; Cheng, Joseph Y; Lustig, Michael\n\n2018-07-01\n\nTo develop a general phase regularized image reconstruction method, with applications to partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow imaging. The problem of enforcing phase constraints in reconstruction was studied under a regularized inverse problem framework. A general phase regularized reconstruction algorithm was proposed to enable various joint reconstruction of partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow imaging, along with parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS). Since phase regularized reconstruction is inherently non-convex and sensitive to phase wraps in the initial solution, a reconstruction technique, named phase cycling, was proposed to render the overall algorithm invariant to phase wraps. The proposed method was applied to retrospectively under-sampled in vivo datasets and compared with state of the art reconstruction methods. Phase cycling reconstructions showed reduction of artifacts compared to reconstructions without phase cycling and achieved similar performances as state of the art results in partial Fourier, water-fat and divergence-free regularized flow reconstruction. Joint reconstruction of partial Fourierâ+ water-fat imagingâ+âPIâ+âCS, and partial Fourierâ+âdivergence-free regularized flow imagingâ+âPIâ+âCS were demonstrated. The proposed phase cycling reconstruction provides an alternative way to perform phase regularized reconstruction, without the need to perform phase unwrapping.

The narrowness of the peak does suggest an astronomical origin; however the shape of the peak is incompatible with both linear and nonlinear models that attribute the cycle to eccentricity or (equivalently) to the envelope of the precession. In contrast, the orbital inclination parameter gives a good match to both the spectrum and bispectrum of the climate data. Extraterrestrial accretion from meteoroids or interplanetary dust is proposed as a mechanism that could link inclination to climate, and experimental tests are described that could prove or disprove this hypothesis.

These stratigraphic cycles have been identified in many types of proxies, e.g., gamma ray, magnetic susceptibility, oxygen isotopes, carbonate content, grayscale, etc. However, the commonly prominent spectral power of orbital eccentricity cycles in stratigraphy is paradoxical to insolation, which is dominated by precession index power. How is the spectral power transferred from precession to eccentricity in stratigraphy? Nonlinear sedimentation and bioturbation have long been identified as players in this transference. Here, we propose that in the absence of bioturbation differential compaction can generate the transference. Using insolation time series, we trace the steps by which insolation is transformed into stratigraphy, and how differential compaction of lithology acts to transfer spectral power from precession to eccentricity. Differential compaction is applied to unique values of insolation, which is assumed to control the type of deposited sediment. High compaction is applied to muds, and progressively lower compaction is applied to silts and sands, or carbonate. Linear differential compaction promotes eccentricity spectral power, but nonlinear differential compaction elevates eccentricity spectral power to dominance and precession spectral power to near collapse as is often observed in real stratigraphy. Keywords: differential compaction, cyclostratigraphy, insolation, eccentricity\n\nCharacterizing cycle-to-cycle variations of the shedding cycle in the turbulent wake of a normal flat plate using generalized phase averages\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMartinuzzi, Robert\n\n2016-11-01\n\nQuasi-periodic vortex shedding in the turbulent wake of a thin-flat plate placed normal to a uniform stream at Reynolds number of 6700 is investigated based on Particle Image Velocimetry experiments. The wake structure and vortex formation are characterized using a generalized phase average (GPA), a refinement of the triple decomposition of Reynolds and Hussain (1970) incorporating elements of mean-field theory (Stuart, 1958). The resulting analysis highlights the importance of cycle-to-cycle variations in characterizing vortex formation, wake topology and the residual turbulent Reynolds Stresses. For example, it is shown that during high-amplitude cycles vorticity is strongly concentrated within the well-organized shed vortices, whereas during low-amplitude cycles the shed vortices are highly distorted resulting in significant modulation of the shedding frequency. It is found that high-amplitude cycles contribute more to the coherent Reynolds stress field while the low-amplitude cycles contribute to the residual stress field. It is further shown that traditional phase-averaging techniques lead to an over-estimation of the residual stress field.

S.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThere are three main contributors to the glacial drawdown of atmospheric CO2 content: starvation of the supply of carbon to the ocean-atmosphere reservoir, excess CO2 storage in the deep sea, and surface-ocean cooling. In this talk, I explore a scenario in which all three play significant roles. Key to this scenario is the assumption that deep ocean storage is related to the extent of nutrient stratification of the deep Atlantic. The stronger this stratification, the larger the storage of respiration CO2. Further, it is my contention that the link between Milankovitch insolation cycles and climate is reorganizations of the ocean's thermohaline circulation leading to changes in the deep ocean's CO2 storage. If this is the case, the deep Atlantic d13C record kept in benthic foraminifera shells tells us that deep ocean CO2 storage follows Northern Hemisphere summer insolation cycles and thus lacks the downward ramp so prominent in the records of sea level, benthic 18O and CO2. Rather, the ramp is created by the damping of planetary CO2 emissions during glacial time intervals. As it is premature to present a specific scenario, I provide an example as to how these three contributors might be combined. As their magnitudes and shapes remain largely unconstrained, the intent of this exercise is to provoke creative thinking.\n\nReplicating the Ice-Volume Signal of the Early Pleistocene with a Complex Earth System Model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTabor, C. R.; Poulsen, C. J.; Pollard, D.\n\n2013-12-01\n\ngreater summer insolation variability from the cycle of precession. We find obliquity enhances the climate sensitivity to direct insolation forcing through positive high-latitude surface feedbacks between vegetation, sea-ice, and mean-annual insolation while the seasonal dichotomy of precessional forcing leads to climate counterbalancing that dampens the annual ice-volume response. Longer cycle duration further amplifies the ice-volume response to obliquity. Our results help remedy the discrepancies between Milankovitch theory and the ice-volume proxy records. However, summer insolation intensity remains the most important factor for determining ice-volume rate-of-change in our experiments. Consequently, we still find a significant ice-volume response to precession, which is inconsistent with the Early Pleistocene records. The disconnect is likely attributable to climate phenomena not accounted for in the model or our choice of initial conditions, which are poorly constrained for the Early Pleistocene and ice-sheet modeling in general. Future work will examine the importance of initial climate conditions on ice-volume response.\n\nMid-Ocean Ridge Melt Supply and Glacial Cycles: A 3D EPR Study of Crustal Thickness, Layer 2A, and Bathymetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoulahanis, B.; Aghaei, O.; Carbotte, S. M.; Huybers, P. J.; Langmuir, C. H.; Nedimovic, M. R.; Carton, H. D.; Canales, J. P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nRecent studies suggest that eustatic sea level fluctuations induced by glacial cycles in the Pleistocene may influence mantle-melting and volcanic eruptions at mid-ocean ridges (MOR), with models predicting variation in oceanic crustal thickness linked to sea level change. Previous analyses of seafloor bathymetry as a proxy for crustal thickness show significant spectral energy at frequencies linked to Milankovitch cycles of 1/23, 1/41, and 1/100 ky-1, however the effects of faulting in seafloor relief and its spectral characteristics are difficult to separate from climatic signals. Here we investigate the hypothesis of climate driven periodicity in MOR magmatism through spectral analysis, time series comparisons, and statistical characterization of bathymetry data, seismic layer 2A thickness (as a proxy for extrusive volcanism), and seafloor-to-Moho thickness (as a proxy for total magma production). We utilize information from a three-dimensional multichannel seismic study of the East Pacific Rise and its flanks from 9Â°36`N to 9Â°57`N. We compare these datasets to the paleoclimate \"LR04\" benthic Î´18O stack. The seismic dataset covers 770 km2 and provides resolution of Moho for 92% of the imaged region. This is the only existing high-resolution 3-D image across oceanic crust, making it ideal for assessing the possibility that glacial cycles modulate magma supply at fast spreading MORs. The layer 2A grid extends 9 km (170 ky) from the ridge axis, while Moho imaging extends to a maximum of 16 km (310 ky). Initial results from the East Pacific Rise show a relationship between sea level and both crustal thickness and sea floor depth, consistent with the hypothesis that magma supply to MORs may be modulated by glacial cycles. Analysis of crustal thickness and bathymetry data reveals spectral peaks at Milankovitch frequencies of 1/100 ky-1 and 1/41 ky-1 where datasets extend sufficiently far from the ridge. The layer 2A grid does not extend sufficiently far from the\n\nThe 1,800-year oceanic tidal cycle: A possible cause of rapid climate change\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKeeling, Charles D.; Whorf, Timothy P.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nVariations in solar irradiance are widely believed to explain climatic change on 20,000- to 100,000-year time-scales in accordance with the Milankovitch theory of the ice ages, but there is no conclusive evidence that variable irradiance can be the cause of abrupt fluctuations in climate on time-scales as short as 1,000 years. We propose that such abrupt millennial changes, seen in ice and sedimentary core records, were produced in part by well characterized, almost periodic variations in the strength of the global oceanic tide-raising forces caused by resonances in the periodic motions of the earth and moon. A well defined 1,800-year tidal cycle is associated with gradually shifting lunar declination from one episode of maximum tidal forcing on the centennial time-scale to the next. An amplitude modulation of this cycle occurs with an average period of about 5,000 years, associated with gradually shifting separation-intervals between perihelion and syzygy at maxima of the 1,800-year cycle. We propose that strong tidal forcing causes cooling at the sea surface by increasing vertical mixing in the oceans. On the millennial time-scale, this tidal hypothesis is supported by findings, from sedimentary records of ice-rafting debris, that ocean waters cooled close to the times predicted for strong tidal forcing.

The working substance of the GIQSRC is a particle confined in a general 1D potential which energy spectrum can be expressed as Îµn = âÏnÏ . Heat leakage and non-ideal regeneration loss are taken into account. The expressions of coefficient of performance (COP) and dimensionless cooling load are obtained. The different practical cases of the energy spectrum are analyzed. The results of this paper are meaningful to understand the quantum thermodynamics cycles with a particle confined in different potential as working substance.\n\nThe water cycle in the general circulation model of the martian atmosphere\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShaposhnikov, D. S.; Rodin, A. V.; Medvedev, A. S.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWithin the numerical general-circulation model of the Martian atmosphere MAOAM (Martian Atmosphere: Observation and Modeling), we have developed the water cycle block, which is an essential component of modern general circulation models of the Martian atmosphere. The MAOAM model has a spectral dynamic core and successfully predicts the temperature regime on Mars through the use of physical parameterizations typical of both terrestrial and Martian models. We have achieved stable computation for three Martian years, while maintaining a conservative advection scheme taking into account the water-ice phase transitions, water exchange between the atmosphere and surface, and corrections for the vertical velocities of ice particles due to sedimentation. The studies show a strong dependence of the amount of water that is actively involved in the water cycle on the initial data, model temperatures, and the mechanism of water exchange between the atmosphere and the surface. The general pattern and seasonal asymmetry of the water cycle depends on the size of ice particles, the albedo, and the thermal inertia of the planet's surface. One of the modeling tasks, which results from a comparison of the model data with those of the TES experiment on board Mars Global Surveyor, is the increase in the total mass of water vapor in the model in the aphelion season and decrease in the mass of water ice clouds at the poles. The surface evaporation scheme, which takes into account the turbulent rise of water vapor, on the one hand, leads to the most complete evaporation of ice from the surface in the summer season in the northern hemisphere and, on the other hand, supersaturates the atmosphere with ice due to the vigorous evaporation, which leads to worse consistency between the amount of the precipitated atmospheric ice and the experimental data. The full evaporation of ice from the surface increases the model sensitivity to the size of the polar cap; therefore, the increase in the\n\nInsolation-driven 100 kyr glacial cycles and millennial climate change\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbe-Ouchi, A.; Saito, F.; Kawamura, K.; Raymo, M. E.; Okuno, J.; Takahashi, K.; Blatter, H.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe waxing and waning of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over the past one million years is dominated by an approximately 100-kyr periodicity and a sawtooth pattern (gradual growth and fast termination). Milankovitch theory proposes that summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles, and statistical tests demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles. However, insolation alone cannot explain the strong 100 kyr cycle which presumably arises through internal climatic feedbacks. Prior work with conceptual models, for example, showed that glacial terminations are associated with the build-up of Northern Hemisphere 'excess ice', but the physical mechanisms of 100-kyr cycle at work remain unclear. Here, using comprehensive climate and ice sheet models, we show that the ~100-kyr periodicity is explained by insolation and internal feedback amongst the climate, ice sheet and lithosphere/asthenosphere system (reference). We found that equilibrium states of ice sheets exhibit hysteresis responses to summer insolation, and that the shape and position of the hysteresis loop play a key role in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the North American ice sheet is such that, after its inception, the ice sheet mass balance remains mostly positive or neutral through several precession cycles whose amplitude decreases towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required to turn the mass balance to negative. Therefore, once the large ice sheet is established, only a moderate increase in insolation can trigger a negative mass balance, leading to a complete retreat within several thousand years, due to the delayed isostatic rebound. The effect of ocean circulation and millennial scale climate change are not playing the dominant role for determing the 100kyr cycle, but are effective for\n\nStudents' Understanding of Analogy after a Core (Chemical Observations, Representations, Experimentation) Learning Cycle, General Chemistry Experiment\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAvargil, Shirly; Bruce, Mitchell R.

By studying the asymptotic expansion of the first order Melnikov function corresponding to the period annulus, we obtain the formulas of the first six coefficients in the expansion, based on which, we provide a lower bound for the maximal number of limit cycles bifurcated from the period annulus. As applications, two concrete systems are considered. Especially, the first one reveals that a quadratic piecewise Hamiltonian system can have five limit cycles near a generalized homoclinic loop under a quadratic piecewise smooth perturbation. Compared with the smooth case [Horozov & Iliev, 1994; Han et al., 1999], three more limit cycles are found.\n\nInsolation-driven 100,000-year glacial cycles and hysteresis of ice-sheet volume.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbe-Ouchi, Ayako; Saito, Fuyuki; Kawamura, Kenji; Raymo, Maureen E; Okuno, Jun'ichi; Takahashi, Kunio; Blatter, Heinz\n\n2013-08-08\n\nThe growth and reduction of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over the past million years is dominated by an approximately 100,000-year periodicity and a sawtooth pattern (gradual growth and fast termination). Milankovitch theory proposes that summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles, and statistical tests have demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles. Yet insolation alone cannot explain the strong 100,000-year cycle, suggesting that internal climatic feedbacks may also be at work. Earlier conceptual models, for example, showed that glacial terminations are associated with the build-up of Northern Hemisphere 'excess ice', but the physical mechanisms underpinning the 100,000-year cycle remain unclear.

Therefore, once a large ice sheet is established, a moderate increase in insolation is sufficient to trigger a negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet within several thousand years. This fast retreat is governed mainly by rapid ablation due to the lowered surface elevation resulting from delayed isostatic rebound, which is the lithosphere\n\nHigh frequency peritidal cycles in the lower member of the Late Cretaceous (Turonian, Coniasian-Santonian) El Hefhuf Formation, Bahariya Oases, Western Desert, Egypt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhalifa, M. A.; Tanner, Lawrence H.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nCarbonate lithofacies of the lower member of the El Hefhuf Formation (Turonian, Coniasian-Santonian) in the Bahariya Oases, Western Desert of Egypt comprise dolostone, burrowed dolostone, cherty dolostone, calcareous dedolostone, dolomitic quartzose lime-mudstone, and caliche. The dolostone and cherty dolostone formed in intertidal to supratidal environments, while dedolostone and caliche were formed during subaerial exposure. The dolomitic quartzose lime-mudstone was deposited in a restricted subtidal environment. Stable isotope analyses of the dolostone lithofacies are consistent with dolomitization by normal marine to evaporatively enriched dolomitizing fluids with only slight mixing of meteoric water. Therefore, dolomitization occurred in the intertidal and supratidal environments immediately following deposition. The dolostone and cherty dolostone lithofacies display pronounced cyclicity at the sub-meter scale, with individual cycles consisting of one (monolithic), two (diad) or at most three (triad) lithofacies. Most of all cycles show evidence of subaerial exposure at the top, such as brecciations, and many cycles are capped by calcareous palaeosol layers (caliche). In the absence of evidence for cycle periods at Milankovitch-scale frequencies, we reject orbital forcing as the cause of the cyclicity and suggest instead autocyclic depositional processes in the peritidal environment as the primary control on cyclicity, possibly modified by eustatic fluctuations at periods longer than the cycles recorded here. The significance of this study is to suggest formation of dolomite cycles due to high-frequency in sea level with intermittent subaerial exposure.\n\nCrack tip field and fatigue crack growth in general yielding and low cycle fatigue\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMinzhong, Z.; Liu, H. W.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nFatigue life consists of crack nucleation and crack propagation periods. Fatigue crack nucleation period is shorter relative to the propagation period at higher stresses. Crack nucleation period of low cycle fatigue might even be shortened by material and fabrication defects and by environmental attack. In these cases, fatigue life is largely crack propagation period. The characteristic crack tip field was studied by the finite element method, and the crack tip field is related to the far field parameters: the deformation work density, and the product of applied stress and applied strain. The cyclic carck growth rates in specimens in general yielding as measured by Solomon are analyzed in terms of J-integral. A generalized crack behavior in terms of delta is developed. The relations between J and the far field parameters and the relation for the general cyclic crack growth behavior are used to analyze fatigue lives of specimens under general-yielding cyclic-load. Fatigue life is related to the applied stress and strain ranges, the deformation work density, crack nucleus size, fracture toughness, fatigue crack growth threshold, Young's modulus, and the cyclic yield stress and strain. The fatigue lives of two aluminum alloys correlate well with the deformation work density as depicted by the derived theory. The general relation is reduced to Coffin-Manson low cycle fatigue law in the high strain region.\n\nLateral variations of carbonate platform facies and cycles: The Dachstein Limestone (Late Triassic, Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSamankassou, Elias; Enos, Paul\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe driving mechanisms of cyclic patterns in shallow-water platform carbonates remain controversial. The focus of the present paper is to quantify lateral facies variations for a long stratigraphic record in an extensive, continuous, well-exposed cliff of the Dachstein platform that is composed, as many other Phanerozoic carbonate platforms, of peritidal deposits. We noted the lateral continuity of the beds to the degree permitted by the outcrop, generally a few tens or hundreds of meters; exceptionally up to 1.7 km. The study demonstrates the importance of quantification to evaluate origins of sedimentary cycles. The upper 885 m of the Triassic Dachstein platform limestone at Steinernes Meer, Saalfelden, Austria, includes 241 peritidal cycles overlain by 275 m of subtidal, non-cyclic and weakly cyclic limestone. Of 558 subtidal and intertidal beds measured, 121 (21.7%) disappear laterally. An additional 74 beds (13.3%) show significant (>10%) lateral variations in thickness. Mean thickness variation is 50%. Both lateral variations and discontinuities appear to lack a spatial vector. Disappearances toward the inferred platform interior (west), total 10.4% of the beds. East toward the inferred platform margin 11.3% of the beds disappear. Thickness changes occur in 6.6% of beds in each direction. The lack of lateral continuity of beds is consistent with a non-eustatic component to stratification. Erosion of intertidal intervals is the process that can be most readily documented. Erosion, transport, and non-uniform distribution of sediments, superposed on stratigraphic sequences driven by eustacy, are the likely processes which produced the complex, randomly recorded cycle patterns. Cycle duration may not be exclusively determined by Milankovitch processes, as suggested by the discrepancies in the cycle duration and interpretation among stratigraphers of the Dachstein, as well as other Phanerozoic carbonate platforms.

S.; Whiteside, J. H.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nA series of extreme warming events, known as hyperthermals, interrupted the equable climate conditions predominant during the early Cenozoic hothouse. In marine sediments, these hyperthermals are marked by prominent negative carbon isotope excursions, indicative of dramatic and abrupt changes in the global exogenic carbon pool, as well as carbonate dissolution horizons and benthic foraminiferal extinctions. Hyperthermals are well documented in the marine record, but it is less clear how patterns of global carbon cycling manifested in early Cenozoic terrestrial environments, although some studies have documented amplified excursions relative to that of the marine record. The lacustrine Eocene Green River Formation of Utah is an excellent system for studying the continental environmental context of global carbon cycle dynamics during this time. These sediments span a ~15 Myr time interval, including the entire Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) and the transition to the long-term Cenozoic cooling trend. To investigate the relationship between the continental carbon record and global carbon cycling, climate, and orbital forcing, we studied a detailed section from the P-4 core drilled in the Uinta Basin bracketing the famous âMahogany Bedâ, a petroliferous layer of oil shale recording a period of enhanced productivity and carbon burial near the end of the EECO. Our carbon isotope measurements of high molecular weight n-alkanes across this boundary suggest a stable global carbon cycle and climate regime persisting ~400 kyr at the terminal EECO. Frequency spectra of published oil yield and gamma ray data from this section reveal concentrated power at Milankovitch frequencies, permitting the assembly of a robust age model. In concert with radioisotopic age control, our orbital chronology allows for comparison of our carbon cycle record to early Eocene astronomical solutions. We show that the Mahogany Bed corresponds to strong minima in short and long eccentricity\n\nTesting anthropic selection: a climate change example.\n\nPubMed\n\nWaltham, Dave\n\n2011-03-01\n\nPlanetary anthropic selection, the idea that Earth has unusual properties since, otherwise, we would not be here to observe it, is a controversial idea. This paper proposes a methodology by which to test anthropic proposals by comparison of Earth to synthetic populations of Earth-like planets. The paper illustrates this approach by investigating possible anthropic selection for high (or low) rates of Milankovitch-driven climate change. Three separate tests are investigated: (1) Earth-Moon properties and their effect on obliquity; (2) Individual planet locations and their effect on eccentricity variation; (3) The overall structure of the Solar System and its effect on eccentricity variation. In all three cases, the actual Earth/Solar System has unusually low Milankovitch frequencies compared to similar alternative systems. All three results are statistically significant at the 5% or better level, and the probability of all three occurring by chance is less than 10(-5). It therefore appears that there has been anthropic selection for slow Milankovitch cycles. This implies possible selection for a stable climate, which, if true, undermines the Gaia hypothesis and also suggests that planets with Earth-like levels of biodiversity are likely to be very rare.

F.\n\nHigh-resolution pollen analyses on the lignite-clay Lupoaia section (from 4.9 to 4.3 Ma) in southwestern Romania provide an accurate record of the Lower Pliocene veg- etation changes in the Danube paleodelta environment close to the Carpathians. Many major fluctuations concern thermophilous trees vs. altitudinal trees (chiefly in agree- ment with lignite-clay alternations) and have been referred to changes in temperature. Thanks to a reliable magnetostratigraphic calibration of the section, such changes are to be linked to eccentricity cycles, that provides a more precise chronologic control to the section (Popescu, in press). In addition, regular secondary fluctuations occur which oppose swamp trees (such as most of the Taxodiaceae) to marsh herbs (such as Cyperaceae). They evoke the present-day landscape of the Mississippi delta where swamp forests (constituted by Taxodium distichum mainly) are in competition with herbaceous marshes (made of Cyperaceae such as Mariscus jamaicensis in addition to some Cyrillaceae and Myrica). The latest require significantly more water than the swamps (Roberts, 1986). These plant environments cause two kinds of lignite deposition that have been also identified in the Lupoaia section (Ticleanu and Dia- conita, 1997). According to the chronologic frame previously defined, it is possible to evidence a precession forcing for these alternations. Minima in precession probably caused increasing rainfall over the region and expansion of marshes. So, it is sug- gested that during Lower Pliocene the West Asian monsoon influenced climate of the northeastern Mediterranean region. References. Popescu, S.-M., in press.
