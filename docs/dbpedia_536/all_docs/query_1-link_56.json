        "text": "Intensity formulas for triplet bands\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBudo, A.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nPrevious work in this area is surveyed and the mathematics involved in determining the quantitative intensity measurements in triplet bands is presented. Explicit expressions for the intensity distribution in the branches of the 3 Sigma-3 Pi and 1 Sigma-3Pi bands valid for all values of the coupling constant Y of the 3 Pi terms are given. The intensity distribution calculated according to the formulas given is compared with measurements of PH, 3 Pi-3 Sigma. Good quantitative agreement is obtained.\n\nInfrared band intensities of saturated hydrocarbons\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPinkley, L. W.; Sethna, P. P.; Williams, D.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nKramers-Kronig analysis is applied to measured values of spectral reflectance at near-normal incidence to determine the real and the imaginary parts of the complex index of refraction for methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, n-hexane, n-heptane, and n-decane in the liquid state. The results indicate that the strengths of the characteristic bands as measured by the integral of the imaginary part are roughly constant for all the liquid alkanes except for methane. The intensity of the CH valence vibration bands in the spectra of the alkanes except methane is directly proportional to the number of CH groups per unit volume. The relations for the intensity of the bands due to CH2 and CH3 deformations are examined. Characteristic band intensities of the type established for NH4(+) and SO4(2-) groups in solutions and crystals cannot be extended to the more closely coupled CH2 and CH3 groups in alkane molecules.\n\nInfrared line intensity measurements in the v = 0-1 band of the ClO radical\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBurkholder, James B.; Howard, Carleton J.; Hammer, Philip D.; Goldman, Aaron\n\n1989-01-01\n\nIntegrated line intensity measurements in the ClO-radical fundamental vibrational v = 0-1 band were carried out using a high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer coupled to a long-path-length absorption cell. The results of a series of measurements designed to minimize systematic errors, yielded a value of the fundamental IR band intensity of the ClO-radical equal to 9.68 + or - 1.45/sq cm per atm at 296 K. This result is consistent with all the earlier published results, with the exception of measurements reported by Kostiuk et al. (1986) and Lang et al. (1988).\n\nIntensity Measurements of the 01(sup 1)21-00(sup 0)01 Perpendicular CO2 band at 5315 cm (sup -1) and 4 related hot bands\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiver, Lawrence P.; Chackerian, Charles, Jr.; Spencer, Mark N.; Brown, Linda R.; Wattson, Richard B.; Gore, Warren J. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe near-infrared thermal emission windows in the spectrum of the night-side of Venus have stimulated new determinations of the intensities of weak CO2 bands which are prominent absorption features in Venus spectra. We have previously measured the 31(sup 1)04-00(sup 0)01 band at 4416 cm (sup -1), which dominates a portion of the 2.2 micrometer window, using the 25-meter White absorption cell at Ames. Parameters for many of the unmeasured bands have been recomputed for the HITRAN compilation using direct numerical diagonalization. This procedure has some uncertainties, particularly for higher overtone-combination perpendicular bands, and substantial differences were noted for these bands when comparing the 1986 HITRAN tabulation with the 1992 values. To clarify this situation, we decided to measure the intensities of several of these bands; L.R.B. obtained spectra using the McMath FTS and 6 meter White cell, covering the region 3800 to 7700 cm (sup -1). A table is provided in which we compare our measured intensities and Herman-Wallis al parameters for the 01(sup 1)21-00(sup 0)01 band and 4 associated hot bands with both Hitran tabulations. It is anticipated that these measured values will be useful in further DND calculations of many very weak unmeasurable bands.\n\nIntensity measurements for the /2, O/ gamma-band of O2, b 1Sigma-g/+/ - X 3Sigma-g/-/\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMiller, J. H.; Giver, L. P.; Boese, R. W.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nLine intensities for the P sub P and P sub Q branches of the (2-O) vibrational band of the magnetic dipole electronic transition for the oxygen red system at 6280 A were measured, and the sum of the R sub R and R sub Q branch intensities was taken. A large number of repetitive spectral scans were required for accuracy, because of low absorption values even at optical path lengths from 300 to 600 m. A total of 557 individual measurements of P-branch lines yielded an intensity value for the P-branches, and equivalent widths for 24 spectral scans yielded an intensity value for the R-branch. R-branch to P-branch intensity ratios were taken for the A-band, B-band, and gamma-band (respectively, O-O at 7620 A, 1-O at 6880 A, and 2-O at 6280 A). Intensities for some rotational lines are found, and effects of combined rotation-vibration interaction are probed.\n\nLine intensity measurements and analysis in the Î½3 band of ruthenium tetroxide\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVander Auwera, J.; Reymond-Laruinaz, S.; Boudon, V.; Doizi, D.; Manceron, L.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRuthenium tetroxide (RuO4) is a heavy tetrahedral molecule characterized by an unusual volatility near ambient temperature. Because of its chemical toxicity and the radiological impact of its 103Ru and 106Ru isotopologues, the possible remote sensing of this compound in the atmosphere has renewed interest in its spectroscopic properties. The present contribution is the first investigation dealing with high-resolution line-by-line intensity measurements for the strong fundamental band observed near 10 Î¼m, associated with the excitation of the infrared active stretching mode Î½3. It relies on new, high resolution FTIR spectra recorded at room temperature, using a specially constructed cell and an isotopically pure sample of 102Ru16O4. Relying on an effective Hamiltonian and associated effective dipole moment [S Reymond-Laruinaz et al, J Mol Spectrosc 2015;315:46-54], the measured line intensities were assigned and dipole moment parameters determined. A HITRAN-formatted frequency and intensity line list was generated.\n\nEffective line intensity measurements of trans-nitrous acid (HONO) of the Î½1 band near 3600 cm-1 using laser difference-frequency spectrometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaamary, Rabih; Fertein, Eric; Fourmentin, Marc; Dewaele, DorothÃ©e; Cazier, Fabrice; Chen, Changshui; Chen, Weidong\n\n2017-07-01\n\nWe report on the measurements of the effective line intensities of the Î½1 fundamental band of trans-nitrous acid (trans-HONO) in the infrared near 3600 cm-1 (2.78 Î¼m). A home-made widely tunable laser spectrometer based on difference-frequency generation (DFG) was used for this study. The strengths of 28 well-resolved absorption lines of the Î½1 band were determined by scaling their absorption intensities to the well referenced absorption line intensity of the Î½3 band of trans-HONO around 1250 cm-1 recorded simultaneously with the help of a DFB quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectrometer. The maximum measurement uncertainty of 12% in the line intensities is mainly determined by the uncertainty announced in the referenced line intensities, while the measurement precision in frequency positions of the absorption lines is better than 6Ã10-4 cm-1. The cross-measurement carried out in the present work allows one to perform intensity calibration using well referenced line parameters.\n\nLine Intensities in the Î½ 8Band of HNO 3\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, W. F.; Looi, E. C.; Tan, T. L.; Ong, P. P.\n\n1996-07-01\n\nLine intensity measurements have been made on the Î½ 8band of HNO 3using a high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrum in the region 739-800 cm -1. A least-squares fit of a total of 710 line intensities in the Pand Rbranches was performed, leading to accurate determination of five dipole moment operator constants. By utilizing these constants, the observed line intensities are well reproduced with an average random error of 6% and the integrated band intensity is found to be 15.7 Â± 0.9 cm -2atm -1at 296 K.\n\nUncertainties of the Intensity of the 1130 nm Band of Water Vapor\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiver, L. P.; Pilewskie, P.; Gore, W. J.; Chackerian, C., Jr.; Varanasi, P.; Bergstrom, R.; Freedman, R. S.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nBelmiloud, et al have recently suggested that the HITRAN line intensities in the 1130 nm water vapor band are much too weak. Giver, et at corrected unit conversion errors to make the HITRAN intensities compatible with the original measurements of Mandin, et al, but Belmiloud, et al believe that many of those line intensity measurements were too weak, and they propose the total intensity of the 1130 nm water vapor band is 38% stronger than the sum of the HITRAN line intensities in this region. We have made independent assessments of this proposal using 2 spectra obtained with the Ames 25 meter base path White cell. The first was made using the moderate resolution (8 nm) solar spectral flux radiometer (SSFR) flight instrument with a White cell absorbing path of 506 meters and 10 torr water vapor pressure. Modeling this spectrum using the HITRAN linelist gives a reasonable match, and the model is not compatible when the HITRAN line intensities are increased by 38%. The second spectrum was obtained with a White cell path of 1106 meters and 12 torr water vapor pressure, using a Bomem FTIR with near Doppler width resolution. This spectrum is useful for measuring intensities of isolated weak lines to compare with the measurements of Mandin, et al. Unfortunately, as Belmiloud et al point out, at these conditions the strong lines are much too saturated for good intensity measurements. Our measurements of the weak lines are in reasonable agreement with those of Mandin, et al. Neither of our spectra supports the proposal of Belmiloud et al for a general 38% increase of the absorption intensity in the 1130 nm water vapor band.\n\nMeasurements of Band Intensities, Herman-Wallis Parameters, and Self-Broadening Line-Widths of the 30011 - 00001 and 30014 - 00001 Bands of CO2 at 6503 cm(exp -1) and 6076 cm(exp -1)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiver, L. P.; Brown, L. R.; Wattson, R. B.; Spencer, M. N.; Chackerian, C., Jr.; Strawa, Anthony W. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1995-01-01\n\nRotationless band intensities and Herman-Wallis parameters are listed in HITRAN tabulations for several hundred CO2 overtone-combination bands. These parameters are based on laboratory measurements when available, and on DND calculations for the unmeasured bands. The DND calculations for the Fermi interacting nv(sub 1) + v(sub 3) polyads show the a(sub 2) Herman-Wallis parameter varying smoothly from a negative value for the first member of the polyad to a positive value for the final member. Measurements of the v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) dyad are consistent with the DND calculations for the a(sub 2) parameter, as are our recent measurements of the 4v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) pentad. However, the measurement-based values in the HITRAN tables for the 2v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) triad and the 3v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) tetrad do not support the DND calculated values for the a(sub 2) parameters. We therefore decided to make new measurements to improve some of these intensity parameters. With the McMath FTS at Kitt Peak National Observatory/National Solar Observatory we recorded several spectra of the. 4000 to 8000 cm(exp -1) region of pure CO2 at 0.011 cm(exp -1) resolution using the 6 meter White absorption cell. The signal/noise and absorbance of the first and fourth bands of the 3v(sub 1) + v(sub 3) tetrad of C-12O-16 were ideal on these spectra for measuring line intensities and broadening widths. Our selfbroadening results agree with the HITRAN parameterization, while our measurements of the rotationless band intensities are about 15% less than the HITRAN values. We find a negative value of a(sub 2) for the 30011-00001 band and a positive value for the 30014-00001 band, whereas the HITRAN values of a(sub 2) are positive for all four tetrad bands. Our a(sub 1) and a(sub 2) Herman-Wallis parameters are closer to DND calculated values than the 1992 HITRAN values for both the 30011-00001 and the 30014-00001 band.\n\nThe nu sub 9 fundamental of ethane - Integrated intensity and band absorption measurements with application to the atmospheres of the major planets\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVaranasi, P.; Cess, R. D.; Bangaru, B. R. P.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nMeasurements of the absolute intensity and integrated band absorption have been performed for the nu sub 9 fundamental band of ethane. The intensity is found to be about 34 per sq cm per atm at STP, and this is significantly higher than previous estimates. It is shown that a Gaussian profile provides an empirical representation of the apparent spectral absorption coefficient. Employing this empirical profile, a simple expression is derived for the integrated band absorption, which is in excellent agreement with experimental values. The band model is then employed to investigate the possible role of ethane as a source of thermal infrared opacity within the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, and to interpret qualitatively observed brightness temperatures for Saturn.\n\nTemperature dependence of intensities of the 8-12 micron bands of CFCl3\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNanes, R.; Silvaggio, P. M.; Boese, R. W.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe absolute intensities of the 8-12 micron bands from Freon 11 (CFCl3) were measured at temperatures of 294 and 216 K. Intensities of the bands centered at 798, 847, 934, and 1082 per cm are all observed to depend on temperature. The temperature dependence for the 847 and 1082 per cm fundamental regions is attributed to underlying hot bands; for the nu2 + nu5 combination band (934 per cm), the observed temperature dependence is in close agreement with theoretical prediction. The implication of these results on atmospheric IR remote-sensing is briefly discussed.\n\nRaman band intensities of tellurite glasses.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlotnichenko, V G; Sokolov, V O; Koltashev, V V; Dianov, E M; Grishin, I A; Churbanov, M F\n\n2005-05-15\n\nRaman spectra of TeO2-based glasses doped with WO3, ZnO, GeO2, TiO2, MoO3, and Sb2O3 are measured. The intensity of bands in the Raman spectra of MoO3-TeO2 and MoO3-WO3-TeO2 glasses is shown to be 80-95 times higher than that for silica glass. It is shown that these glasses can be considered as one of the most promising materials for Raman fiber amplifiers.\n\nLaboratory Measurements of the 940, 1130, and 1370 nm Water Vapor Absorption Band Profiles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiver, Lawrence P.; Gore, Warren J.; Pilewskie, P.; Freedman, R. S.; Chackerian, C., Jr.; Varanasi, P.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nWe have used the solar spectral flux radiometer (SSFR) flight instrument with the Ames 25 meter base-path White cell to obtain about 20 moderate resolution (8 nm) pure water vapor spectra from 650 to 1650 nm, with absorbing paths from 806 to 1506 meters and pressures up to 14 torr. We also obtained a set at 806 meters with several different air-broadening pressures. Model simulations were made for the 940, 1130, and 1370 nm absorption bands for some of these laboratory conditions using the Rothman, et al HITRAN-2000 linelist. This new compilation of HITRAN includes new intensity measurements for the 940 nm region. We compared simulations for our spectra of this band using HITRAN-2000 with simulations using the prior HITRAN-1996. The simulations of the 1130 nm band show about 10% less absorption than we measured. There is some evidence that the total intensity of this band is about 38% stronger than the sum of the HITRAN line intensities in this region. In our laboratory conditions the absorption depends approximately on the square root of the intensity. Thus, our measurements agree that the band is stronger than tabulated in HITRAN, but by about 20%, substantially less than the published value. Significant differences have been shown between Doppler-limited resolution spectra of the 1370 nm band obtained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and HITRAN simulations. Additional new intensity measurements in this region are continuing to be made. We expect the simulations of our SSFR lab data of this band will show the relative importance of improving the HITRAN line intensities of this band for atmospheric measurements.\n\nAbsolute band intensities in the nu19/nu23 (530 cm(-1)) and nu7 (777 cm(-1)) bands of acetone ((CH3)2CO) from 232 to 295 K\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWang, W. F.; Stevenson, A.; Reuter, D. C.; Sirota, J. M.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAbsolute band intensities of acetone ((CH3)2CO) in the nu19/nu23 and nu7 band systems near 530 and 777 cm(-1), respectively, were measured at temperatures of 232, 262 and 295 K, using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. No evident temperature dependence for the band intensities was observed. The dipole moments and the fundamental band intensities were derived in the harmonic oscillator approximation. The results are useful for the spectroscopic retrieval of acetone concentrations in the upper atmosphere.\n\nMeasurements of Lorentz air-broadening coefficients and relative intensities in the H2O-16 pure rotational and nu2 bands from long horizontal path atmospheric spectra\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRinsland, Curtis P.; Smith, Mary Ann H.; Goldman, Aaron; Malathy Devi, V.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nLorentz air-broadening coefficients and relative intensities have been measured for forty-three lines in the pure rotational band and twenty lines in the nu2 band of H2O-16 between 800 and 1150/cm. The results were derived from analysis of nine 0.017/cm-resolution atmospheric absorption spectra recorded over horizontal paths of 0.5-1.5 km with the McMath Fourier transform spectrometer and main solar telescope operated on Kitt Peak by the National Solar Observatory. A nonlinear least-squares spectral fitting technique was used in the spectral analysis. The results are compared with previous measurements and calculations. In most cases, the measured pressure-broadening coefficients and intensities are significantly different from the values in the 1986 HITRAN line parameters compilation.\n\nMeasurements of the ClO radical vibrational band intensity and the ClO + ClO + M reaction product\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBurkholder, James B.; Orlando, John J.; Hammer, Philip D.; Howard, Carleton J.; Goldman, Aaron\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThere is considerable interest in the kinetics and concentrations of free radicals in the stratosphere. Chlorine monoxide is a critically important radical because of its role in catalytic cycles for ozone depletion. Depletion occurs under a wide variety of conditions including the Antarctic spring when unusual mechanisms such as the BrO sub x/ClO sub x, ClO dimer (Cl sub 2 O sub 2), and ClO sub x/HO sub x cycles are suggested to operate. Infrared spectroscopy is one of the methods used to measure ClO in the stratosphere (Menzies 1979 and 1983; Mumma et al., 1983). To aid the quantification of such infrared measurements, researchers measured the ClO ground state fundamental band intensity.\n\nQuantitative Measurement of Integrated Band Intensities of Isoprene and Formaldehyde\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrauer, Carolyn S.; Johnson, Timothy J.; Blake, Thomas A.; Sams, Robert L.\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe OH-initiated oxidation of isoprene, which is one of the primary volatile organic compounds produced by vegetation, is a major source of atmospheric formaldehyde and other oxygenated organics. Both molecules are also known products of biomass burning. Absorption coefficients and integrated band intensities for isoprene and formaldehyde are reported in the 600 - 6500 cm^{-1} region. The pressure broadened (1 atmosphere N_2) spectra were recorded at 278, 298 and 323 K in a 19.96 cm path length cell at 0.112 cm^{-1} resolution, using a Bruker 66V FTIR. Composite spectra are composed of a minimum of seven pressures at each temperature for both molecules. These data are part of the PNNL Spectral Database, which contains quantitative spectra of over 600 molecules. These quantitative spectra facilitate atmospheric monitoring for both remote and in situ sensing and such applications will be discussed. Timothy J. Johnson, Luisa T. M. Profeta, Robert L.

Yokelson Vibrational Spectroscopy {53}(1);97-102 (2010).\n\nThe Rovibrational Intensities of Five Absorption Bands of (12)C(16)O2 Between 5218 and 5349/cm\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiver, Lawrence P.; Brown, Linda R.; Chackerian, Charles, Jr.; Freedman, Richard S.; Gore, Warren J. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAbsolute line intensities, band intensities, and Herman-Wallis parameters were measured for the (01(sup 1)2)(sub I) from (00(sup 0)0)(sub I) perpendicular band of (12)C(16)O2 centered at 5315/cm, along with the three nearby associated hot bands: (10(sup 0)2)(sub II) from (01(sup 1)0)(sub I) at 5248/cm, (02(sup 2))(sub I) from (01(sup 1)0)(sub I) at 5291/cm, and (10(sup 0)2)(sub I) from (01(sup 1)0)(sub I) at 5349/cm. The nearby parallel hot band (30(sup 0))(sub I) from (10(sup 0)0)(sub II) at 5218/cm was also included in this study.\n\nComparison of HITRAN Calculated Spectra with Laboratory Measurements of the 820, 940, 1130, and 1370 nm Water Vapor Bands\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGiver, Lawrence P.; Pilewskie, P.; Gore, Warren J.; Freedman, R. S.; Chackerian, C., Jr.; Varanasi, P.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nSeveral groups have recently been working to improve the near-infrared spectrum of water vapor on HITRAN. The unit-conversion errors found by Giver, et al have now been corrected on the recently released HITRAN-2000. The most important aspect of this article for atmospheric absorption was increasing all the HITRAN-1996 intensities of the 940 nm band by nearly 15%. New intensity measurements of this band by Brown, et al (submitted to J. Mol. Spec.) have now been included in the latest HITRAN. However, Belmiloud, et al discuss new data in the 633-1175 nm region which they expect will substantially increase the calculated absorption of solar radiation by water vapor. They suggest the 4 bands at 725, 820, 940, and 1130 nm are all stronger than the sum of the line intensities currently on HITRAN. For the 725 and 820 nm bands, their recommended intensity increases are 10% and 15%, about the same as previously noted by Grossmann and Browell and Ponsardin and Browell. Belmiloud, et al only suggest a 6% increase for the 940 nm. band over the corrected HITRAN-1996 intensities, but a large 38% increase for the 1130 nm band. The new data discussed by Belmiloud, et al have now been published in greater detail by Schermaul, et al. The intensity increase for the 1130 nm band discussed by Belmiloud, et al is very substantial; it is important to quickly determine if the HITRAN intensity values are in error by as much as they claim. Only intensity errors for the strong lines could result in the total band intensity being in error by such a large amount. To quickly get a number of spectra of the entire near-infrared region from 650 to 1650 nm, we used the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer with our 25-meter base path White absorption cell. This moderate resolution spectrometer is a flight instrument that has flown on the Sandia Twin Otter for the ARESE 11 experiment. The measured band profiles were then compared to calculated spectra using the latest HITRAN line intensities, convolved\n\nW-Band Transmission MeasurementS and X-Band Dielectric Properties Measurements for a Radome Material Sample\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCravey, Robin L.; Tiemsin, Pacita I.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis paper describes measurements which were performed on a sample of radome material in the Electromagnetic Properties Measurements Laboratory (EPML). The purpose of the measurements described in this paper was to determine the one-way transmission loss through the flat panel of radome material for a frequency range of 84 to 94 GHz, for varying incidence angles. The panel, which was manufactured by Norton Performance Plastics Corporation, was provided to the EPML by TRW. The size of the panel is 40 in x 36 in x 0.422 in and consists of a foam material with one side coated with a smooth white coating (this side will be referred to as the front side). The dielectric properties of the foam material from the inside of the panel were also determined at X-band (8.2-12.4 GHz). The W-band free space measurements are presented first, followed by the X-band dielectric properties measurements.\n\nAbsolute Rovibrational Intensities for the Chi(sup 1)Sigma(sup +) v=3 <-- 0 Band of (12)C(16)O Obtained with Kitt Peak and BOMEM FTS Instruments\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChackerian, Charles, Jr.; Kshirsagar, R. J.; Giver, L. P.; Brown, L. R.; Condon, Estelle P. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThis work was initiated to compare absolute line intensities retrieved with the Kitt Peak FTS (Fourier Transform Spectrometer) and Ames BOMEM FTS. Since thermal contaminations can be a problem using the BOMEM instrument if proper precautions are not taken it was thought that measurements done at 6300 per cm would more easily result in satisfactory intercomparisons. Very recent measurements of the CO 3 <-- 0 band fine intensities confirms results reported here that the intensities listed in HITRAN (High Resolution Molecular Absorption Database) for this band are on the order of six to seven percent too low. All of the infrared intensities in the current HITRAN tabulation are based on the electric dipole moment function reported fifteen years ago. The latter in turn was partly based on intensities for the 3 <-- 0 band reported thirty years ago. We have, therefore, redetermined the electric dipole moment function of ground electronic state CO.\n\nPhotometric intensity and polarization measurements of the solar corona.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcdougal, D. S.\n\n1971-01-01\n\nUse of a satellite photometric observatory (SPO) to measure the solar corona from Miahuatlan, Mexico during the Mar. 7, 1970, total eclipse of the sun. The SPO is equipped with a 24-in. Cassegrainian telescope, a four-channel photoelectric photometer, a Wollaston prism, and a rotating half-wave plate. Simultaneous measurements were made of the two orthogonal components of coronal light in the B and R bands of the UBVRI system. A 1-minute arc aperture was scanned from the lunar disk center out to five solar radii in a series of spirals of gradually increasing radius. For the first time, simultaneous multicolor intensity, degree, and angle of polarization profiles are computed from photoelectric measurements. Comparison of the variations of the measurements for each spiral scan yield a detailed picture of the intensity and polarization features in the K corona.\n\nOrigins of IR Intensity in Overtones and Combination Bands in Hydrogen Bonded Systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHorvath, Samantha; McCoy, Anne B.\n\n2010-06-01\n\nAs the infrared spectra of an increasing number of hydrogen bonded and ion/water complexes have been investigated experimentally, we find that they often contain bands with significant intensity that cannot be attributed to fundamental transitions. In this talk, we explore several sources of the intensity of these overtone and combination bands. A common source of intensity is mode-mode coupling, as is often seen between the proton transfer coordinate and the associated heavy atom vibration. A second important mechanism involves large changes in the dipole moment due the loss of a hydrogen bond. This results in intense overtone transitions involving non-totally symmetric vibrations as well as the introduction of intense combination bands involving intramolecular bending coupled to hindered rotations. These effects will be discussed in the context of several systems, including the spectra of complexes of argon atoms with {H}_3{O}^+, F^-\\\\cdotH_2O, Cl^-\\\\cdotH_2O, protonated water clusters,^a and HOONO.

Segmentation of the prostate from ultrasound images with weak boundaries widely exists in clinical applications. One of the most typical examples is the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Accurate segmentation of the prostate boundaries from ultrasound images plays an important role in many prostate-related applications such as the accurate placement of the biopsy needles, the assignment of the appropriate therapy in cancer treatment, and the measurement of the prostate volume. Ultrasound images of the prostate are usually corrupted with intensity inhomogeneities, weak boundaries, and unwanted edges, which make the segmentation of the prostate an inherently difficult task. Regarding to these difficulties, the authors introduce an active band term and an edge descriptor term in the modified level set energy functional. The active band term is to deal with intensity inhomogeneities and the edge descriptor term is to capture the weak boundaries or to rule out unwanted boundaries. The level set function of the proposed model is updated in a band region around the zero level set which the authors call it an active band. The active band restricts the authors' method to utilize the local image information in a banded region around the prostate contour. Compared to traditional level set methods, the average intensities insideâoutside the zero level set are only computed in this banded region. Thus, only pixels in the active band have influence on the evolution of the level set. For weak boundaries, they are hard to be distinguished by human eyes, but in local patches in the band region around prostate boundaries, they are easier to be detected. The authors incorporate an edge descriptor to calculate the total intensity variation in a local patch paralleled to the normal direction of the zero level set, which can detect weak boundaries\n\nSegmentation of prostate from ultrasound images using level sets on active band and intensity variation across edges\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Xu; Li, Chunming; Fedorov, Andriy; Kapur, Tina; Yang, Xiaoping\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPurpose: In this paper, the authors propose a novel efficient method to segment ultrasound images of the prostate with weak boundaries.

P.; Chackerian, C., Jr.; Spencer, N.; Brown, L. R.; Wattson, R. B.; Gore, Warren J. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1995-01-01\n\nCarbon dioxide is the major constituent of the atmospheres of both Mars and Venus. Correct interpretations of spectra of these atmospheres require accurate knowledge of a substantial number of absorption bands of this gas. This is especially true for Venus; many weak CO2 bands that are insignificant in the earth's atmosphere are prominent absorbers in Venus' hot, dense lower atmosphere. Yet, recent near-infrared spectra of Venus' nightside have discovered emission windows, which occur between CO2 absorption bands, at 4040-4550 cm(exp-1), 5700-5900 cm(exp-1), and several smaller ones between 7500 and 9400 cm(exp-1). This radiation is due to thermal emission from Venus' lower atmosphere, diminished by scattering and absorption within the sulfuric acid clouds on its way to space. Simulations of these data with radiative transfer models can provide improved information on the abundances of a number of constituents of the lower atmosphere (e.g. H2O, CO, HDO, HCl, HF, and OCS) and the optical properties of the clouds, whose spatial variation modulates the brightness of the emissions. However, the accuracy of these retrievals has been limited by insufficient knowledge of the opacity of some of the gas species, including CO2, at the large pathlengths and high temperatures and pressures that exist on Venus. In particular, modeling the emission spectrum did not produce a good fit for the emission window centered at 7830 cm(exp-1). In an ongoing effort to assist analyses of these Venus spectra, we have been making laboratory intensity measurements of several weak bands of CO2 which are significant absorbers in these Venus emission windows. The CO2 bands that are prominent in the 7830 cm(exp-1) region belong to the vibrational sequence 4v1+v3 and associated hot bands. Only 2 of the 5 bands of this sequence have been previously measured. Modeling Venus' emission spectrum in the 7830 cm(exp-1) region had to rely on calculated intensity values for the weak ground state band at\n\nConcentration measurement of NO using self-absorption spectroscopy of the Î³ band system in a pulsed corona discharge.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhai, Xiaodong; Ding, Yanjun; Peng, Zhimin; Luo, Rui\n\n2012-07-10\n\nNitric oxide (NO) concentrations were measured using the Î³ band system spectrum based on the strong self-absorption effect of NO in pulsed corona discharges. The radiative transitional intensities of the NO Î³ band were simulated based on the theory of molecular spectroscopy. The intensities of some bands, especially Î³(0,0) and Î³(1,0), are weakened by the self-absorption. The correlations between the spectral self-absorption intensities and NO concentration were validated using a modified Beer-Lambert law with a combined factor K relating the branching ratio and the NO concentration, and a nonlinear index Î± that is applicable to the broadband system. Optical emissive spectra in pulsed corona discharges in NO and N2/He mixtures were used to evaluate the two parameters for various conditions. Good agreement between the experimental and theoretical results verifies the self-absorption behavior seen in the UV spectra of the NO Î³ bands.\n\na Rigorous Comparison of Theoretical and Measured Carbon Dioxide Line Intensities\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYi, Hongming; Fleisher, Adam J.; Gameson, Lyn; Zak, Emil J.; Polyansky, Oleg; Tennyson, Jonathan; Hodges, Joseph T.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe ability to calculate molecular line intensities from first principles plays an increasingly important role in populating line-by-line spectroscopic databases because of its generality and extensibility to various isotopologues, spectral ranges and temperature conditions. Such calculations require a spectroscopically determined potential energy surface, and an accurate dipole moment surface that can be either fully ab initio or an effective quantity based on fits to measurements Following our recent work where we used high-precision measurements of intensities in the (30013 â00001) band of ^{12}C^{16}O_2 to bound the uncertainty of calculated line lists, here we carry out high-precision, frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy measurements in the R-branch of the ^{12}C^{16}O_2 (20012 â00001) band from J = 16 to 52. Gas samples consisted of 50 Î¼mol mol^{-1} or 100 Î¼mol mol^{-1} of nitrogen-broadened carbon dioxide with gravimetrically determined SI-traceable molar composition. We demonstrate relative measurement precision (Type A) at the 0.15 % level and estimate systematic (Type B) uncertainty contributions in % of: isotopic abundance 0.01; sample density, 0.016; cavity free spectral rang,e 0.03; line shape, 0.05; line interferences, 0.05; and carbon dioxide molar fraction, 0.06. Combined in quadrature, these components yield a relative standard uncertainty in measured line intensity less than 0.2 % for most observed transitions. These intensities differ by more than 2 % from those measured by Fourier transform spectroscopy and archived in HITRAN 2012 but differ by less than 0.5 % with the calculations of Zak et al. E.

These measurements were made with a Michelson interferometer to cover wavelength regions between 1000 nm and 2000 nm. A spectral analysis was performed to individual nights of data to acquire information on the waves in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere. It is assumed that the measured fluctuations in the intensity and temperature of the OH (3-1) airglow were caused by gravity waves propagating through the emission layer. Correlation of intensity and temperature variation revealed oscillations with periods ranging from 2 to 9 hours. We also calculated Krassovsky's parameter and compared with published values.\n\nAbsolute intensities and self-, N2-, and air-broadened Lorentz halfwidths for selected lines in the nu3 band of (C-12)H3D from measurements with a tunable diode laser spectrometer\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMalathy Devi, V.; Benner, D. C.; Rinsland, C. P.; Smith, M. A. H.; Thakur, K. B.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nAbsolute intensities and self-, air- and N2-broadened half-widths have been determined for the first time for individual lines in the nu3(A1) band of (C-12)H3D near 7.6 microns from measurements of individual vibration-rotation lines using a tunable diode laser spectrometer. The intensity measurements are believed to be accurate to within three percent. Within experimental uncertainties, equal broadening efficiencies are found for both air and nitrogen. Self-broadened half-widths determined for three transitions yield an average half-width value of 0.803 + or -0.0010/cm/atm at 296 K.\n\nPotential energy surface, dipole moment surface and the intensity calculations for the 10 Î¼m, 5 Î¼m and 3 Î¼m bands of ozone\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPolyansky, Oleg L.; Zobov, Nikolai F.; Mizus, Irina I.; Kyuberis, Aleksandra A.; Lodi, Lorenzo; Tennyson, Jonathan\n\n2018-05-01\n\nMonitoring ozone concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere using spectroscopic methods is a major activity which undertaken both from the ground and from space. However there are long-running issues of consistency between measurements made at infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. In addition, key O3 IR bands at 10 Î¼m, 5 Î¼m and 3 Î¼m also yield results which differ by a few percent when used for retrievals. These problems stem from the underlying laboratory measurements of the line intensities. Here we use quantum chemical techniques, first principles electronic structure and variational nuclear-motion calculations, to address this problem. A new high-accuracy ab initio dipole moment surface (DMS) is computed. Several spectroscopically-determined potential energy surfaces (PESs) are constructed by fitting to empirical energy levels in the region below 7000 cm-1 starting from an ab initio PES. Nuclear motion calculations using these new surfaces allow the unambiguous determination of the intensities of 10 Î¼m band transitions, and the computation of the intensities of 10 Î¼m and 5 Î¼m bands within their experimental error. A decrease in intensities within the 3 Î¼m is predicted which appears consistent with atmospheric retrievals. The PES and DMS form a suitable starting point both for the computation of comprehensive ozone line lists and for future calculations of electronic transition intensities.\n\nMeasurement of the Band-to-Band Registration of the SNPP VIIRS Imaging System from On-Orbit Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTilton, James C.; Lin, Guoqing; Tan, Bin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument was launched 28 October 2011 onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. The VIIRS instrument is a whiskbroom system with 22 spectral and thermal bands split between 16 moderate resolution bands (M-bands), five imagery resolution bands (I-bands) and a day-night band. In this study we measure the along-scan and along-track band-to-band registration between the I-bands and M-bands from on-orbit data. This measurement is performed by computing the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between shifted image band pairs and finding the amount of shift required (if any) to produce the peak in NMI value. Subpixel accuracy is obtained by utilizing bicubic interpolation. Registration shifts are found to be similar to pre-launch measurements and stable (within measurement error) over the instruments first four years in orbit.\n\n14NH_3 Line Positions and Intensities in the Far-Infrared Comparison of Ft-Ir Measurements to Empirical Hamiltonian Model Predictions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSung, Keeyoon; Yu, Shanshan; Pearson, John; Pirali, Olivier; Kwabia Tchana, F.; Manceron, Laurent\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWe have analyzed multiple spectra of high purity (99.5%) normal ammonia sample recorded at room temperatures using the FT-IR and AILES beamline at Synchrotron SOLEIL, France. More than 2830 line positions and intensities are measured for the inversion-rotation and rovibrational transitions in the 50 - 660 wn region. Quantum assignments were made for 2047 transitions from eight bands including four inversion-rotation bands (gs(a-s), Î½b{2}(a-s), 2Î½b{2}(a-s), and Î½b{4}(a-s)) and four ro-vibrational bands (Î½b{2} - gs, 2Î½b{2} - gs, Î½b{4} - Î½b{2}, and 2Î½b{2} -Î½b{4}), as well as covering more than 300 lines of ÎK = 3 forbidden transitions. Out of the eight bands, we note that 2Î½b{2} - Î½b{4} has not been listed in the HITRAN 2012 database. The measured line positions for the assigned transitions are in an excellent agreement (typically better than 0.001 wn) with the predictions from the empirical Hamiltonian model [S. Yu, J.C. Pearson, B.J. Drouin, et al.(2010)] in a wide range of J and K for all the eight bands. The comparison with the HITRAN 2012 database is also satisfactory, although systematic offsets are seen for transitions with high J and K and those from weak bands. However, differences of 20% or so are seen in line intensities for allowed transitions between the measurements and the model predictions, depending on the bands. We have also noticed that most of the intensity outliers in the Hamiltonian model predictions belong to transitions from gs(a-s) band. We present the final results of the FT-IR measurements of line positions and intensities, and their comparisons to the model predictions and the HITRAN 2012 database. Research described in this paper was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology, under contracts and cooperative agreements with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nRelative intensity calculations for nitrous oxide.\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nYoung, L.

P.; Kshirsagar, R. J.; Freedman, R. C.; Chackerian, C., Jr.; Wattson, R. B.; Gore, Warren J. (Technical Monitor)\n\n1998-01-01\n\nA substantial set of CO2 spectra from 4500 to 12000/cm has been obtained at Ames with 1500 m path length using a Bomem DA8 FTS. The signal/noise was improved compared to prior spectra obtained in this laboratory by including a filter wheel limiting the band-pass of each spectrum to several hundred per cm. We have measured positions of lines in several weak bands not previously resolved in laboratory spectra. Using our positions and assignments of lines of the Qbranch of the 31103-00001 vibrational band at 4591/cm, we have redetermined the rotational constants for the 31103f levels. Q-branch lines of this band were previously observed, but misassigned, in Venus spectra by Mandin. The current HITRAN values of the rotational constants for this level are incorrect due to the Q-branch misassignments. Our prior measurements of the 21122-00001 vibrational band at 7901/cm were limited to Q-and R-branch lines; with the improved signal/noise of these new spectra we have now measured lines in the weaker P branch. The 21122 (Gv = 790148/cm) levels are known to be perturbed by the 32211 (G(sub v) = 789757/cm) levels; new DND calculations predict that high-J lines of the forbidden 32211-00001 vibrational band 'borrow' intensity from the corresponding transitions of the 21122-00001 band. We have identified such Q- and R-branch transitions of the 32211-00001 band from 26 < J\" < 44, based on our position measurements of lines in the 32211-02201 band at 6562/cm.\n\nAbsolute intensities for the Q-branch of the 3 nu(sub 2) (-) nu(sub 1) (465.161/cm) band of nitrous oxide\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSirota, J. Marcos; Reuter, Dennis C.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe absolute intensities of four lines, Q 15-Q 18 in the 03(sup 1)0-10(sup 0)0 band, of N2O have been measured using a tunable diode laser spectrometer at temperatures between 380 and 420 K and pressures between 4 and 15 torr. Even though these transitions are weak and produced only about 2% of absorption at the line center for a pathlength of 52 m, they were measured with a signal to noise ratio of about 20 due to the high sensitivity of the instrument. The band strength derived is 1.03 x 10(exp -24) cm/molec at 296 K.\n\nMeasuring the critical band for speech.\n\nPubMed\n\nHealy, Eric W; Bacon, Sid P\n\n2006-02-01\n\nThe current experiments were designed to measure the frequency resolution employed by listeners during the perception of everyday sentences. Speech bands having nearly vertical filter slopes and narrow bandwidths were sharply partitioned into various numbers of equal log- or ERBN-width subbands. The temporal envelope from each partition was used to amplitude modulate a corresponding band of low-noise noise, and the modulated carriers were combined and presented to normal-hearing listeners. Intelligibility increased and reached asymptote as the number of partitions increased. In the mid- and high-frequency regions of the speech spectrum, the partition bandwidth corresponding to asymptotic performance matched current estimates of psychophysical tuning across a number of conditions. These results indicate that, in these regions, the critical band for speech matches the critical band measured using traditional psychoacoustic methods and nonspeech stimuli. However, in the low-frequency region, partition bandwidths at asymptote were somewhat narrower than would be predicted based upon psychophysical tuning. It is concluded that, overall, current estimates of psychophysical tuning represent reasonably well the ability of listeners to extract spectral detail from running speech.\n\nCharacterization of polarimetric and total intensity behaviour of a complete sample of PACO radio sources in the radio bands\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGalluzzi, V.; Massardi, M.; Bonaldi, A.; Casasola, V.; Gregorini, L.; Trombetti, T.; Burigana, C.; Bonato, M.; De Zotti, G.; Ricci, R.; Stevens, J.; Ekers, R.

R.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe present high sensitivity (ÏP â 0.6 mJy) polarimetric observations in seven bands, from 2.1 to 38 GHz, of a complete sample of 104 compact extragalactic radio sources brighter than 200 mJy at 20 GHz. Polarization measurements in six bands, in the range 5.5-38 GHz, for 53 of these objects were reported by Galluzzi et al. We have added new measurements in the same six bands for another 51 sources and measurements at 2.1 GHz for the full sample of 104 sources. Also, the previous measurements at 18, 24, 33, and 38 GHz were re-calibrated using the updated model for the flux density absolute calibrator, PKS1934-638, not available for the earlier analysis. The observations, carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, achieved a 90 per cent detection rate (at 5Ï) in polarization. 89 of our sources have a counterpart in the 72-231 MHz GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array) survey, providing an unparalleled spectral coverage of 2.7 decades of frequency for these sources. While the total intensity data from 5.5 to 38 GHz could be interpreted in terms of single component emission, a joint analysis of more extended total intensity spectra presented here, and of the polarization spectra, reveals that over 90 per cent of our sources show clear indications of at least two emission components. We interpret this as an evidence of recurrent activity. Our high sensitivity polarimetry has allowed a 5Ï detection of the weak circular polarization for Ë 38 per cent of the data set, and a deeper estimate of 20 GHz polarization source counts than has been possible so far.\n\nMeasuring the Epoch of Reionization using [CII] Intensity Mapping with TIME-Pilot\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCrites, Abigail; Bock, James; Bradford, Matt; Bumble, Bruce; Chang, Tzu-Ching; Cheng, Yun-Ting; Cooray, Asantha R.; Hailey-Dunsheath, Steve; Hunacek, Jonathon; Li, Chao-Te; O'Brient, Roger; Shirokoff, Erik; Staniszewski, Zachary; Shiu, Corwin; Uzgil, Bade; Zemcov, Michael B.; Sun, Guochao\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTIME-Pilot (the Tomographic Ionized carbon Intensity Mapping Experiment) is a new instrument designed to probe the epoch of reionization (EoR) by measuring the 158 um ionized carbon emission line [CII] from redshift 5 - 9. TIME-Pilot will also probe the molecular gas content of the universe during the epoch spanning the peak of star formation (z ~ 1 -3) by making an intensity mapping measurement of the CO transitions in the TIME-Pilot band (CO(3-2), CO(4-3), CO(5-4), and CO(6-5)). I will describe the instrument we are building which is an R of ~100 spectrometer sensitive to the 200-300 GHz radiation. The camera is designed to measure the line emission from galaxies using an intensity mapping technique. This instrument will allow us to detect the [CII] clustering fluctuations from faint galaxies during EoR and compare these measurements to predicted [CII] amplitudes from current models. The CO measurements will allow us to constrain models for galaxies at lower redshift. The [CII] intensity mapping measurements that will be made with TIME-Pilot and detailed measurements made with future more sensitive mm-wavelength spectrometers are complimentary to 21-cm measurements of the EoR and complimentary to direct detections of high redshift galaxies with HST, ALMA, and, in the future, JWST.\n\nA Novel Ku-Band/Ka-Band and Ka-Band/E-Band Multimode Waveguide Couplers for Power Measurement of Traveling-Wave Tube Amplifier Harmonic Frequencies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWintucky, Edwin G.; Simons, Rainee N.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper presents the design, fabrication and test results for a novel waveguide multimode directional coupler (MDC). The coupler, fabricated from two dissimilar frequency band waveguides, is capable of isolating power at the second harmonic frequency from the fundamental power at the output port of a traveling-wave tube (TWT) amplifier. Test results from proof-of-concept demonstrations are presented for a Ku-band/Ka-band MDC and a Ka-band/E-band MDC. In addition to power measurements at harmonic frequencies, a potential application of the MDC is in the design of a satellite borne beacon source for atmospheric propagation studies at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies (Ka-band and E-band).\n\nInfrared line intensities of chlorine monoxide\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKostiuk, T.; Faris, J.

J.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nAbsolute infrared line intensities of several ClO lines in the rotational-vibrational (1-0) band were measured using infrared heterodyne spectroscopy near 12 microns. A measurement technique using combined ultraviolet absorption and infrared line measurements near 9.5 microns and 12 microns permitted an accurate determination of the column densities of O3 and ClO in the absorption cell and thus improved ClO line intensities. Results indicate ClO line and band intensities approximately 2.4 times lower than previous experimental results. Effects of possible failure of local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions in the absorption cell and the implication of the results for stratospheric ClO measurements in the infrared are discussed.\n\nQ branches of the nu7 fundamental of ethane (C2H6) Integrated intensity measurements for atmospheric measurement applications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRinsland, C.

The method by which the spectra were obtained is described, and a typical spectrum covering the PQ3 branch at 2976.8/cm is shown along with a plot of equivalent width vs. optical density for this branch. The values of the integrated intensities reported for each branch are the means of five different optical densities.\n\nPassive Microwave Measurements Over Conifer Forests at L-Band and C-Band\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLeVine, D.

A series of aircraft measurements were made in July, August and November, 1999 over relatively homogenous conifer forests of varying biomass. Three radiometers participated in these measurements. These were: 1) the L-band radiometer ESTAR, a horizontally polarized synthetic aperture radiometer which has been used extensively in past measurements of soil moisture; 2) the L-band radiometer SLFMR, a vertically polarized cross-track scanner which has been used successfully in the past for mapping sea surface salinity; and 3) The ACMR, a new C-band radiometer which operates at V- and H-polarization and in the configuration for these experiments did not scan. All three radiometers were flown on the NASA P-3 aircraft based at the Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility. The ESTAR and SLFMR were mounted in the bomb bay of the P-3 and imaged across track whereas the ACMR was mounted to look aft at 54 degrees up from nadir. Data was collected at altitudes of 915 meters and 457 meters. The forests consisted of relatively homogeneous \"managed\" stands of conifer located near Waverly, Virginia. This is a relatively flat area about 30 miles southeast of Richmond, VA with numerous stands of trees being grown for the forestry industry. The stands selected for study consisted of areas of regrowth and mature stands of pine. In addition, a small stand of very large trees was observed. Soil moisture sampling was done in each stand during the aircraft over flights. Data was collected on July 7, August 27, November 15 and November 30, 1999. Measurements were made with ESTAR on all days. The ACMR flew on the summer missions and the SLFMR was present only on the August 27 flight. Soil moisture varied from quite dry on July 7 to quite moist on November 30 (which was shortly after a period of rain).

In the present work, we discuss the role of temperature- and illumination-dependent device electrical measurements in quantifying and distinguishing these performance losses - in particular, for determining bounds on interface recombination velocities, band alignment, and minority carrier lifetime. We assess the accuracy of this approach by direct comparison to photoelectron spectroscopy. Then, we demonstrate how more computationally intensive model parameter fitting approaches can draw more insights from this broad measurement space.

Computational studies on modeled Zn-coordinated chlorins allowed identification of charge transfer and d-d transitions of the Ni2+ coordinated chlorins. Two fictive Zn chlorins, M1 and M2, were designed with thiophene units based on the fluorene substituted chlorin. Substitution with thiophene altered the typical arrangement of the four Gouterman molecular orbitals (MOs) and red-shifted and greatly intensified the lowest energy absorption band (the Q band). The introduction of the thiophene-based MO as the LUMO below the usual Gouterman LUMO is predicted to increase the efficiency of electron transfer from the dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor in DSSCs. The addition of a donor group on the opposite pyrrole (M2) red-shifted the Q band further and introduced a donor-based MO between the typical Gouterman HOMO and HOMO-1. Despite the relatively small ÎHOMO, M1 and M2 exhibited remarkably intense Q bands. M2 would be a possible candidate for application in DSSCs due to its panchromatic absorption, intense and red-shifted Q band, and the presence of the substituent based MO properties. Another indicator of a successful dye is the alignment of the ground state and excited state oxidation potentials (GSOP and ESOP, respectively) with respect to the conduction band of the semiconductor. The GSOP for M2 lies 0.55 eV below the I-/I3- redox potential and the ESOP lies 0.48 eV above the TiO2 conduction band. The impact of the thiophene dominance in the LUMO also supports the prediction of efficient sensitization properties. The remarkably intense Q band of M2 predicted to be at 777 nm with a ÎHOMO of just 1.04 eV provides a synthetic route\n\nIntensity Biased PSP Measurement\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSubramanian, Chelakara S.; Amer, Tahani R.; Oglesby, Donald M.; Burkett, Cecil G., Jr.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe current pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique assumes a linear relationship (Stern-Volmer Equation) between intensity ratio (I(sub 0)/I) and pressure ratio (P/P(sub 0)) over a wide range of pressures (vacuum to ambient or higher). Although this may be valid for some PSPs, in most PSPs the relationship is nonlinear, particularly at low pressures (less than 0.2 psia when the oxygen level is low). This non-linearity can be attributed to variations in the oxygen quenching (de-activation) rates (which otherwise is assumed constant) at these pressures. Other studies suggest that some paints also have non-linear calibrations at high pressures; because of heterogeneous (non-uniform) oxygen diffusion and c quenching. Moreover, pressure sensitive paints require correction for the output intensity due to light intensity variation, paint coating variation, model dynamics, wind-off reference pressure variation, and temperature sensitivity. Therefore to minimize the measurement uncertainties due to these causes, an in- situ intensity correction method was developed. A non-oxygen quenched paint (which provides a constant intensity at all pressures, called non-pressure sensitive paint, NPSP) was used for the reference intensity (I(sub NPSP)) with respect to which all the PSP intensities (I) were measured. The results of this study show that in order to fully reap the benefits of this technique, a totally oxygen impermeable NPSP must be available.\n\nIntensity Biased PSP Measurement\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSubramanian, Chelakara S.; Amer, Tahani R.; Oglesby, Donald M.; Burkett, Cecil G., Jr.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe current pressure sensitive paint (PSP) technique assumes a linear relationship (Stern-Volmer Equation) between intensity ratio (I(sub o)/I) and pressure ratio (P/P(sub o)) over a wide range of pressures (vacuum to ambient or higher).

The compositional gradients across the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 layer cause variations in the band gap energy, which are experimentally determined using a monochromated scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The results reveal the expected band gap variation across the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 layer and therefore confirm the feasibility of local band gap measurements of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 by VEELS. The precision and accuracy of the results are discussed based on the analysis of individual error sources, which leads to the conclusion that the precision of our measurements is most limited by the acquisition reproducibility, if the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is high enough. Furthermore, we simulate the impact of radiation losses on the measured band gap value and propose a thickness-dependent correction. In future work, localized band gap variations will be measured on a more localized length scale to investigate, e.g., the influence of chemical inhomogeneities and dopant accumulations at grain boundaries.\n\nNanoscale measurements of unoccupied band dispersion in few-layer graphene.\n\nPubMed\n\nJobst, Johannes; Kautz, Jaap; Geelen, DaniÃ«l; Tromp, Rudolf M; van der Molen, Sense Jan\n\n2015-11-26\n\nThe properties of any material are fundamentally determined by its electronic band structure.

An interesting property of phononic crystals and elastic metamaterials is the presence of band gaps, which are bands of frequencies where elastic waves cannot propagate. The presence of band gaps gives this class of materials the potential to be used as vibration isolators. In many studies, the band structures were used to evaluate the band gaps. The presence of band gaps in a finite structure is commonly validated by measuring the frequency response as there are no direct methods of measuring the band structures. In this study, an experiment was conducted to determine the band structure of one dimension phononic crystals with two wave modes, such as a bi-material beam, using the frequency response at only 6 points to validate the wave superposition method (WSM) introduced in a previous study. A bi-material beam and an aluminium beam with varying geometry were studied. The experiment was performed by hanging the beams freely, exciting one end of the beams, and measuring the acceleration at consecutive unit cells. The measured transfer function of the beams agrees with the analytical solutions but minor discrepancies. The band structure was then determined using WSM and the band structure of one set of the waves was found to agree well with the analytical solutions. The measurements taken for the other set of waves, which are the evanescent waves in the bi-material beams, were inaccurate and noisy. The transfer functions at additional points of one of the beams were calculated from the measured band structure using WSM. The calculated transfer function agrees with the measured results except at the frequencies where the band structure was inaccurate. Lastly, a study of the potential sources of errors was also conducted using finite element modelling and the errors in\n\nBand Gap Distortion in Semiconductors Strongly Driven by Intense Mid-Infrared Laser Fields\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKono, J.; Chin, A. H.\n\n2000-03-01\n\nCrystalline solids non-resonantly driven by intense time-periodic electric fields are predicted to exhibit unusual band-gap distortion.(e.g., Y. Yacoby, Phys. Rev. 169, 610 (1968); L.C.M. Miranda, Solid State Commun. 45, 783 (1983); J.Z. Kaminski, Acta Physica Polonica A 83, 495(1993).) Such non-perturbative effects have not been observed to date because of the unavoidable sample damage due to the very high intensity required using conventional lasers ( 1 eV photon energy). Here, we report the first clear evidence of laser-induced bandgap shrinkage in semiconductors under intense mid-infrared (MIR) laser fields. The use of long-wavelength light reduces the required intensity and prohibits strong interband absorption, thereby avoiding the damage problem. The significant sub-bandgap absorption persists only during the existence of the MIR laser pulse, indicating the virtual nature of the effect. We show that this particular example of non-perturbative behavior, known as the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, occurs when the effective ponderomotive potential energy is comparable to the photon energy of the applied field.

The major programs running MFRSR networks in the United States include the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program, U.S. Department of Agriculture UV-B Monitoring and Research Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) Network, and NASA Solar Irradiance Research Network (SIRN). We discuss a number of technical issues specific to shadow-band radiometers and their impact on the optical depth measurements. These problems include instrument tilt and misalignment, as well as some data processing artifacts. Techniques for data evaluation and automatic detection of some of these problems are described.\n\nAbsolute Rovibrational Intensities, Self-Broadening and Self-Shift Coefficients for the X(sup 1) Sigma(+) V=3 (left arrow) V=0 Band (C-12)(O-16)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChackerian, Charles, Jr.; Freedman, R.; Giver, L.

The determination of self-broadening coefficients is improved with the inclusion of line narrowing; self-shifts are also reported.\n\n9-year distributions of rain intensities measured in Prague and their utilization in telecommunications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKvicera, V.; Grabner, M.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nExperimental research in the Department of Frequency Engineering of the Czech Metrology Institute (CMI) in Prague, the Czech Republic, is focused on stability of received signals on terrestrial radio and optical communication paths. Hydrometeors (rain, snow, fog, hails) can cause serious attenuation of electromagnetic waves in the frequency bands above 10 GHz and the availability performances of terrestrial radio communication systems are seriously affected by heavy hydrometeors events. The rain intensity data is usually used for the calculations of attenuation due to rain on terrestrial radio links in accordance with either the relevant ITU-R Recommendation or other methods. Therefore, our experimental research is also focused on our own meteorological measurements in the vicinity of experimental radio and optical paths. The heated tipping-bucket rain gauge with the collector area of 500 cm2 and the rain amount per tip of 0.1 mm is used at CMI for the measurements of intensities of hydrometeors. The time of tips is recorded with uncertainty of 1 second. Hydrometeors intensity data obtained from January 2003 to December 2011 (9 years of observation) was statistically processed over the individual years. All the recorded individual hydrometeor events were compared with the concurrent meteorological conditions and were carefully categorized according to the types of individual hydrometeors, i.e. rain, rain with snow, rain with hails, snow, fog, fog with rain, fog with snow, and fog with rain and snow. The obtained cumulative distributions (CDs) of intensities of individual hydrometeors over 9 years of observation will be presented and compared with the CD of intensities of all hydrometeors together. The rain amounts were examined too. The obtained rain amounts for individual years and the average rain amounts for individual months over the 9-year period will be given.

Even when a grid of sufficient resolution is chosen to ensure scan points within the twins, the interaction volume of the electron beam often encapsulates a region that contains both the parent grain and the twin, confusing the twin identification process. The degradation of the EBSD pattern results in a lower image quality metric, which has long been used to imply potential twins. However, not all bands within the pattern are degraded equally. This paper exploits the fact that parent and twin lattices share common planes that lead to the quality of the associated bands not degrading; i.e. common planes that exist in both grains lead to bands of consistent intensity for scan points adjacent to twin boundaries. Hence, twin boundaries in a microstructure can be recognized, even when they are associated with thin twins. Proof of concept was performed on known twins in Inconel 600, Tantalum, and Magnesium AZ31. This method was then used to search for undetected twins in a Mg AZ31 structure, revealing nearly double the number of twins compared with those initially detected by standard procedures.

J.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe vibration rotation bands of the hydroxyl radical are the strongest features in the night airglow and are exceeded in intensity in the dayglow only by the infrared atmospheric bands of oxygen. The variation of intensity during evening twilight is discussed. Using a ground-based Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), hydroxyl intensity measurements as early as 3 deg solar depression were made. Models of the twilight behavior show that this should be sufficient to provide measurement of the main portion of the twilight intensity change. The instrument was equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled germanium detector whose high sensitivity combined with the efficiency of the FTS technique permits spectra of the region 1.1 to 1.6 microns at high signal-to-noise to be obtained in two minutes. The use of a polarizer at the entrance aperture of the instrument reduces the intensity of scattered sunlight by a factor of at least ten for zenith observations.\n\nComparison of intense electrostatic waves near f/sub UHR/ with linear instability theory\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKurth, W.S.; Frank, L.A.; Gurnett, D.A.\n\n1979-06-01\n\nIntense electrostatic waves beyond the plasmapause have recently been identified at frequencies near the upper hybrid resonance frequency. In addition, the waves occur within a band at an odd, half-harmonic of the local electron gyrofrequency. These bands of electrostatic turbulence are among the most intense waves detected within the earth's magnetosphere. Measurements obtained with the ISEE 1 plasma wave receiver show that the intense waves appear to be intensifications of an electrostatic cyclotron harmonic band near the upper hybrid resonance frequency. A straightforward explanation of intense waves at the upper hybrid resonance frequency exists in the electrostatic multi-cyclotron emission theory.moreÂ Â» For a broad range of plasma parameters nonconvective instability or large spatial growth rates occur within the cyclotron band encompassing the cold upper hybrid frequency. Comparison of spatial growth rate spectra with measured wave spectra shows that there is excellent qualitative agreement between the linear theory and the observed wave characteristics.Â«Â less\n\nDimensions and Measurements of Debuncher Band 3 and 4 Waveguide-Coax Launchers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSun, Ding; /Fermilab\n\n2000-09-13\n\nThis note is a document about dimensions and measurement results of waveguide-coax launchers (Band 3 and 4) installed on the arrays in debuncher cooling upgrade. Shown in Figure 1 and 5 are schematic drawings of launchers (pick-up) in the cross section along the longitudinal direction (beam direction) of the arrays. The unit in these drawings is inch. Note: although there are upper band and lower band for pickup arrays, the launchers are the same to avoid possible confusion during installation. Launchers for band 3 and 4 kickers were made by Penn-engineering Inc., therefor no schematic drawings are presented in thismoreÂ Â» note. RF Measurements were made on all launchers (port) and printed in hard copies for future reference. Since the measurement results are similar to each other, only a few plots for each type of launcher/band are presented in this document. There are two types of measured S11 parameters. One is the measurement made at the end of design/tuning stage using a launcher and a straight section of band 3 or 4 waveguide terminated with a cone of absorber. I use 'Original' to denote this kind of measurement. As shown in Figure 2, 6, 9 and 12, the original S11 of all launchers are below or around -20 db over the full band 3 or 4. The other type of measurement is the one made after these launchers were installed onto the array including several type N feedthrough or connectors, elbows, waveguide bends (kicker) and magic Ts (kicker) etc. The kicker arrays were terminated with wedges of absorber. During all measurements (pickup array or kicker array) when one launcher was being measured, all other launchers were terminated with 50 ohm terminator. As shown in Figure 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14 these 'final' S11s are around -15 db.Â«Â less\n\nEMI survey for maritime satellite, L-band, shipboard terminal\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTaylor, R.

Significant EMC results include: (1) antenna noise temperature measurements indicate a maximum of 70 K steady background component at 1.6 GHz at sea for elevation angles of 5 degrees and higher; (2) field intensity measurements from 1-10 GHz show that a L-band terminal can operate simultaneously with onboard S-band and X-band navigation radar; (3) radar transmitter case emissions, below deck, in-band from 1535-1660 MHz, at 1 m distance from the cabinet, are equivalent, or greater than above-deck emissions in the same frequency range; and (4) conducted-emission tests of a ship's power lines to both radars show both narrow band and broad band emissions are 15 dB to 50 dB higher than equivalent U.S. commercial power lines from 150 kHz to 32 MHz.\n\nBand-filling of solution-synthesized CdS nanowires.\n\nPubMed\n\nPuthussery, James; Lan, Aidong; Kosel, Thomas H; Kuno, Masaru\n\n2008-02-01\n\nThe band edge optical characterization of solution-synthesized CdS nanowires (NWs) is described. Investigated wires are made through a solution-liquid-solid approach that entails the use of low-melting bimetallic catalyst particles to seed NW growth. Resulting diameters are approximately 14 nm, and lengths exceed 1 microm. Ensemble diameter distributions are approximately 13%, with corresponding intrawire diameter variations of approximately 5%. High-resolution transmission electron micrographs show that the wires are highly crystalline and have the wurtzite structure with growth along at least two directions: [0001] and [1010]. Band edge emission is observed with estimated quantum yields between approximately 0.05% and 1%. Complementary photoluminescence excitation spectra show structure consistent with the linear absorption. Carrier cooling dynamics are subsequently examined through ensemble lifetime and transient differential absorption measurements. The former reveals unexpectedly long band edge decays that extend beyond tens of nanoseconds. The latter indicates rapid intraband carrier cooling on time scales of 300-400 fs. Subsequent recovery at the band edge contains significant Auger contributions at high intensities which are usurped by other, possibly surface-related, carrier relaxation pathways at lower intensities. Furthermore, an unusual intensity-dependent transient broadening is seen, connected with these long decays. The effect likely stems from band-filling on the basis of an analysis of observed spectral shifts and line widths.\n\nHydrogen-Saturated Saline Protects Intensive Narrow Band Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in Guinea Pigs through an Antioxidant Effect\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Liwei; Yu, Ning; Lu, Yan; Wu, Longjun; Chen, Daishi; Guo, Weiwei; Zhao, Lidong; Liu, Mingbo; Yang, Shiming; Sun, Xuejun; Zhai, Suoqiang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe purpose of the current study was to evaluate hydrogen-saturated saline protecting intensive narrow band noise-induced hearing loss. Guinea pigs were divided into three groups: hydrogen-saturated saline; normal saline; and control. For saline administration, the guinea pigs were given daily abdominal injections (1 ml/100 g) 3 days before and 1 h before narrow band noise exposure (2.5â3.5 kHz 130 dB SPL, 1 h). The guinea pigs in the control group received no treatment. The hearing function was assessed by the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) recording. The changes of free radicals in the cochlea before noise exposure, and immediately and 7 days after noise exposure were also examined. By Scanning electron microscopy and succinate dehydrogenase staining, we found that pre-treatment with hydrogen-saturated saline significantly reduced noise-induced hair cell damage and hearing loss. We also found that the malondialdehyde, lipid peroxidation, and hydroxyl levels were significantly lower in the hydrogen-saturated saline group after noise trauma, indicating that hydrogen-saturated saline can decrease the amount of harmful free radicals caused by noise trauma. Our findings suggest that hydrogen-saturated saline is effective in preventing intensive narrow band noise-induced hearing loss through the antioxidant effect.

We find the occupied bandwidth to be 1.60{plus minus}0.05 eV, which is narrower than the free-electron bandwidth of 2.12 eV and agrees with recent calculations of the quasiparticle self-energy. A narrow peak near the Fermi level which did not disperse with photon energy was observed for photon energies which, according to the nearly-free-electron model, should yield no direct transitions. A comparison of the binding energy and intensity of the anomalous peakmoreÂ Â» as functions of photon energy is made to the calculations of Shung and Mahan (Phys. Rev. B 38, 3856 (1988)). The discrepancies found are discussed in terms of an enhanced surface photoeffect in the photon energy range 20{le}{h bar}{omega}{le}30 eV. For low photon energies, a bulk peak was also observed due to a surface umklapp process with an intensity comparable to the standard bulk (110) peak. The possible contributions to this strong surface umklapp process from a shear instability at the first few (110) atomic planes is discussed.Â«Â less\n\nElectrically detected magnetic resonance in a W-band microwave cavity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLang, V.; Lo, C.

The advantages of this approach are demonstrated by experiments on silicon field-effect transistors. A comparison with conventional low-frequency measurements at X-band (9.7 GHz) on the same devices reveals an up to 100-fold enhancement of the signal intensity. In addition, resonance lines that are unresolved at X-band are clearly separated in the W-band measurements. Electrically detected magnetic resonance at high magnetic fields and high microwave frequencies is therefore a very sensitive technique for studying electron spins with an enhanced spectral resolution and sensitivity.\n\nSlant path L- and S-Band tree shadowing measurements\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVogel, Wolfhard J.; Torrence, Geoffrey W.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis contribution presents selected results from simultaneous L- and S-Band slant-path fade measurements through a pecan, a cottonwood, and a pine tree employing a tower-mounted transmitter and dual-frequency receiver.

In this paper, an enhancement of the near band edge emission intensity from ZnTe/ZnMgTe core/shell nanowires grown on Si substrates is reported. A special role of the use of Si substrates instead of GaAs substrates is emphasized, which results in an increase of the near band edge emission intensity by at least one order of magnitude accompanied by a simultaneous reduction of the defect related luminescence. A possible explanation of this effect relies on the presence of Ga-related deep level defects in structures grown on GaAs substrates, which are absent when Si substrates are used. Monochromatic mapping of the cathodoluminescence clearly confirms that the observed emission originates, indeed, from the ZnTe/ZnMgTe core/shell nanowires, whereas individual objects are studied by means of microphotoluminescence.\n\nApplication of the Strong Scatter Theory to the Interpretation of Ionospheric Scintillation Measurements along Geostationary Satellite Links at VHF and L-band\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarrano, C.

E.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nIn a previous work, we demonstrated that ionospheric turbulence parameters may be inferred from amplitude scintillations well into in the strong scatter regime [Carrano et al., International Journal of Geophysics, 2012]. This technique, called Iterative Parameter Estimation (IPE), uses the strong scatter theory and numerical inversion to estimate the parameters of an ionospheric phase screen (turbulent intensity, phase spectral index, and irregularity zonal drift) consistent with the observed scintillations. The optimal screen parameters are determined such that the theoretical intensity spectrum on the ground best matches the measured intensity spectrum in a least squares sense. We use this technique to interpret scintillation measurements collected during a campaign at Ascension Island (7.96Â°S, 14.41Â°W) in March 2000, led by Santimay Basu and his collaborators from Air Force Research Laboratory. Geostationary satellites broadcasting radio signals at VHF and L-band were monitored along nearly co-linear links, enabling a multi-frequency analysis of scintillations with the same propagation geometry. The VHF data were acquired using antennas spaced in the magnetic east-west direction, which enabled direct measurement of the zonal irregularity drift. We show that IPE analysis of the VHF and L-Band scintillations, which exhibited very different statistics due to the wide frequency separation, yields similar estimates of the phase screen parameters that specify the disturbed ionospheric medium. This agreement provides confidence in our phase screen parameter estimates. It also suggests a technique for extrapolating scintillation measurements to frequencies other than those observed that is valid in the case of strong scatter. We find that IPE estimates of the zonal irregularity drift, made using scintillation observations along single space-to-ground link, are consistent with those measured independently using the spaced antenna technique.

These measurements demonstrate the utility of making W-Band polarimetric and Doppler spectrum measurements from an airborne platform in investigations of cloud microphysical properties. Comparison of copolar correlation coefficient measurements with aircraft in situ probe measurements verifies that polarimetric measurements indicate phase transitions, and hydrometeor alignment in ice clouds. Melting layers in clouds were measured by the W-Band system on board the King Air during 1992 and 1994. Both measurements established the use of the linear depolarization ratio, LDR, to locate the melting layer using an airborne W-Band system. The measurement during 1994 allowed direct comparison of the magnitude of the copolar correlation coefficient with the values of LDR. The relation between the measurements corresponds with a predicted relationship between the two parameters for observation of particles exhibiting isotropy in the plane of polarization. Measurements of needle crystals at horizontal and vertical incidence provided further evidence that the copolar correlation coefficient values agreed with the expected response from hydrometeors possessing a preferred alignment for the side looking case, and hydrometeors without a preferred alignment for the vertical incidence case. Observation of significant specific differential phase at vertical incidence, the first reported at W-Band, corresponded to a significant increase in differential reflectivity overhead, which was most likely produced by hydrometeor alignment driven by cloud electrification. Comparison of the drop size distributions estimated using the Doppler spectra with those measured by the wingtip probes on the King Air reveals that the radar system is better suited under some liquid cloud conditions to provide microphysical measurements\n\nSatellite Ka-band propagation measurements in Florida\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHelmken, Henry; Henning, Rudolf\n\n1995-01-01\n\nCommercial growth of interactive, high data rate communication systems is expected to focus on the use of the Ka-band (20/30 GHz) radio spectrum. The ability to form narrow spot beams and the attendant small diameter antennas are attractive features to designers of mobile aeronautical and ground based satellite communication systems. However, Ka-band is strongly affected by weather, particularly rain, and hence systems designs may require a significant link margin for reliable operations. Perhaps the most stressing area in North America, weatherwise, is the Florida sub-tropical climatic region. As part of the NASA Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) propagation measurements program, beacon and radiometer data have been recorded since December 1993 at the University of South Florida (USF), Tampa, Florida.\n\nComparison of Columnar Water Vapor Measurements During The Fall 1997 ARM Intensive Observation Period: Optical Methods\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchmid, Beat; Michalsky, J.; Slater, D.; Barnard, J.; Halthore, R.; Liljegren, J.; Holben, B.; Eck, T.; Livingston, J.; Russell, P.;\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIn the fall of 1997 the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM program conducted an intensive Observation Period (IOP) to study water vapor at its Southern Great Plains (SGP) site. Among the large number of instruments, four sun-tracking radiometers were present to measure the columnar water vapor (CWV). All four solar radiometers retrieve CWV by measuring solar transmittance in the 0.94-micrometer water vapor absorption band. As one of the steps in the CWV retrievals the aerosol component is subtracted from the total transmittance, in the 0.94-micrometer band. The aerosol optical depth comparisons among the same four radiometers are presented elsewhere. We have used three different methods to retrieve CWV. Without attempting to standardize on the same radiative transfer model and its underlying water vapor spectroscopy we found the CWV to agree within 0.13 cm (rms) for CWV values ranging from 1 to 5 cm. Preliminary results obtained when using the same updated radiative transfer model with updated spectroscopy for all instruments will also be shown. Comparisons to the microwave radiometer results will be included in the comparisons.\n\nDSN 70-meter antenna X- and S-band calibration. Part 1: Gain measurements\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRichter, P. H.; Slobin, S. D.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAperture efficiency measurements made during 1988 on the three 70-m stations (DSS-14, DSS-43, and DSS-63) at X-band (8420 MHz) and S-band (2295 MHz) have been analyzed and reduced to yield best estimates of antenna gain versus elevation. The analysis has been carried out by fitting the gain data to a theoretical expression based on the Ruze formula.
