        "text": "Getting my teeth into the new Sustainable Residential Development and Compact Settlements Guidelines released this month, some interesting initial takeaways from the development standards section: üèò SPPR1 introduces 16m minimum separation distance for rear/side opposing windows, where 22m is the historical figure that we've been working too. There's some exciting recent precedents for this type of dense housing such as the #StirlingPrize winning Goldsmith Street project by Mikhail Riches in the UK, so excited to see this spreading in Ireland. üöó SPPR3 requires that parking in city centres of the 5 cities be \"minimised, substantially reduced or wholly eliminated\" with max of 1 space per dwelling. Peripheral areas get a max of 2 spaces per dwelling. Nice detail provided in that the counts include visitor parking, but exclude car-club or accessible spaces. üö≤ SPPR4 balances the above with good standards for bike parking: 1 space per bedroom where there is no ground level open space with secure, permanent storage structures expected. ‚òÄ Some clarity on daylighting to avoid overly onerous assessments at planning stages - the document notes that \"it should be clear from the assessment of architectural drawings (including sections) in the case of low-rise housing with good separation from existing and proposed buildings that undue impact would not arise.\" #housing #planning #sustainability https://lnkd.in/esBpv4eg\n\nMakeover for Melbourne's Legal Precinct! 1930s Building to Transform into 23-Storey Tower. The Department of Transport and Planning (DTP) is proposing a major revamp of the State Public Offices building on Lonsdale Street. Ô∏è The plan involves: üî∑Demolishing a significant portion of the existing 1930s building üî∑Constructing a modern 23-storey tower behind the preserved Lonsdale Street facade üî∑Creating new office space for Victorian Government departments Designed by architects Wardle, the proposal offers a significant increase in workspace and includes: üî∑Office space from levels 1 to 22 üî∑Dedicated bicycle storage in the basement and ground floor This project is another sign of Melbourne's ongoing development and focus on modern, sustainable workspaces. However, there are still hurdles to clear. The proposal needs approval from the City of Melbourne's planning committee before a final decision is made by the Victorian Government. What are your thoughts on this development? Would a modern office tower complement the legal precinct? Let me know in the comments! Want to learn more? The full article dives deeper into the project's history and the approval process. Check out the comments section for all the details! #BuildingTalks #MelbourneDevelopment #MelbourneProperty\n\nPaul Smith, managing director at Strategic Land Group, sheds light on the Duchy of Cornwall's ambitious proposal for a new 2,500-home Poundbury-style scheme in Faversham, Kent. In light of the government's emphasis on creating beautiful and enduring places, Smith argues that greater competition, rather than regulation, holds the key to improving housing design. With beauty featuring prominently in the National Planning Policy Framework and the establishment of an Office for Place dedicated to crafting aesthetically pleasing environments, the government aims to garner support for new developments by emphasising quality design. Drawing parallels with Poundbury's success as a model community developed under a comprehensive design code, the South East Faversham project seeks to replicate this approach. Extensive consultations and meticulous planning, including a detailed Housing Manual and masterplan by Ben Pentreath, underscore the commitment to environmental sustainability and community well-being. Despite these efforts, local opposition persists, reflecting broader scepticism towards new developments even when designed with care. Smith highlights research showing that only a small fraction of the population is swayed by improved design in housing projects. While regulation plays a role in setting quality standards, Smith contends that increasing land availability is the real catalyst for fostering competition among developers. By offering consumers a choice among various developments, market dynamics will incentivise higher design standards, akin to the competitive drive behind innovative consumer products like the iPhone. In Smith's view, prioritising increased housing supply over stringent design regulations will ultimately lead to more aesthetically pleasing developments. Competition, he argues, is the true engine of progress in the housing sector. #housing #architecture #designguides #buildingbeautiful THE STRATEGIC LAND GROUP LIMITED https://lnkd.in/e-6Bw_6T\n\nExciting new milestone at 5 Chancery Lane! We‚Äôve appointed Ardmore Group to lead on the redevelopment and retrofit of the 20th century building into flexible high-end office space. Keeping with the current demands and changing nature of the office sector, the redevelopment will provide 105,637 sqft of workspace strategically designed to reduce operational carbon and water consumption. The comprehensive plan for the project includes the retention and reuse of 86% of the original building with Upfront Embodied Carbon costs 33% lower than the GLA‚Äôs aspirational benchmark. Using a circular approach to retrofit, the redevelopment has been pre-assessed BREEAM Excellent. Andrew Parker at Cushman & Wakefield and Frances Warner Lacey at RX London have already started pre-leasing activities ahead of completion in Q1 2026. 5 Chancery Lane illustrates how a building can adhere to both new #netzero regulations and occupier demands, through sustainable retrofit. #Retrofit #offices #London https://shorturl.at/gouY2"
