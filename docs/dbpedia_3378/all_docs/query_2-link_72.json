        "meta_description": "Background Duck is an economically important poultry and animal model for human viral hepatitis B. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying host–virus interaction remain unclear because of limited information on the duck genome. This study aims to characterize the duck normal liver transcriptome and to identify the differentially expressed transcripts at 24 h after duck hepatitis A virus genotype C (DHAV-C) infection using Illumina–Solexa sequencing.  Results After removal of low-quality sequences and assembly, a total of 52,757 unigenes was obtained from the normal liver group. Further blast analysis showed that 18,918 unigenes successfully matched the known genes in the database. GO analysis revealed that 25,116 unigenes took part in 61 categories of biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Among the 25 clusters of orthologous group categories (COG), the cluster for “General function prediction only” represented the largest group, followed by “Transcription” and “Replication, recombination, and repair.” KEGG analysis showed that 17,628 unigenes were involved in 301 pathways. Through comparison of normal and infected transcriptome data, we identified 20 significantly differentially expressed unigenes, which were further confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 20 unigenes, nine matched the known genes in the database, including three up-regulated genes (virus replicase polyprotein, LRRC3B, and PCK1) and six down-regulated genes (CRP, AICL-like 2, L1CAM, CYB26A1, CHAC1, and ADAM32). The remaining 11 novel unigenes that did not match any known genes in the database may provide a basis for the discovery of new transcripts associated with infection.  Conclusion This study provided a gene expression pattern for normal duck liver and for the previously unrecognized changes in gene transcription that are altered during DHAV-C infection. Our data revealed useful information for future studies on the duck genome and provided new insights into the molecular mechanism of host–DHAV-C interaction.",

        "text": "Analysis of differentially expressed genes\n\nThrough comparison of the transcriptome data of the two libraries, we identified 20 significantly differentially expressed unigenes after DHAV-C infection. Among these 20 differentially expressed unigenes, nine matched the known genes in the database, including replicase polyprotein, CRP, activation-induced C-type lectin 2 (AICL-like 2), leucine rich repeat containing 3B (LRRC3B), neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM), Cyp26a1, cation transport regulator-like protein 1 (CHAC1), PCK1, and disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 32 (ADAM32), all of which are host genes, except for the replicase polyprotein gene, which is a viral gene. Replicase polyprotein, a conserved protein in many RNA virus, contains the activities necessary for the transcription of the viral RNA genome [26], [27]. In the present study, the expression of the replicase polyprotein gene of DHAV-C was up-regulated in the infected group, whereas it was not be detected in the control group. This result showed that the host liver was infected with DHAV-C successfully, during which DHAV-C started to reproduce. However, common innate immune related genes, such as Toll-like receptors, Nod-like receptors, and interferon (IFN) genes, were not screened in 20 differentially expressed genes. In addition, the novel non-annotated unigenes accounted for a large proportion of the differentially expressed unigenes (11/20, 55%), which may provide a clue for the discovery of new transcripts associated with immune and infection in duck. This observation may serve as a basis for further investigation of new transcripts associated with duck infection.\n\nAn important characteristic of many viral infections is the induction of host cell apoptosis, which is an important means of host resistance to the virus [28]. However, apoptosis inhibition also exists in many viral infections, which is conducive to viral replication through the extension of the survival time of infected cells [29]–[31]. A previous apoptotic morphological study revealed that DHAV-C infection could cause apoptosis and necrosis in different tissues, especially in the liver [9]. However, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by DHAV-C infection remains unclear. In the present study, two novel genes (CHAC1 and CYP26A1) associated with apoptosis were screened. CHAC1, a highly conserved protein between mammals and bacteria, is a new member of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, which is a stress-signaling pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum [32]. It acts as a pro-apoptotic component of the unfolded protein response pathway by mediating the pro-apoptotic effects of the ATF4-ATF3-DDIT3/CHOP cascade [33]. In this study, CHAC1 expression was significantly down-regulated in the infected group. The repression of CHAC1 expression may inhibit host apoptosis to facilitate DHAV-C replication in viral infection.\n\nIn addition to CHAC1, another apoptosis-related gene, CYP26A1, was also detected. As an isoform of the CYP26 family, CYP26A1 is a major enzyme that controls retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis by catalyzing RA into bio-inactive metabolites [34]. It is moderately induced by RA in numerous tissues but is highly responsive in liver [35]. Recent studies have shown that the cells expressing CYP26A1 gain significant resistance to apoptosis because of the state of reduced bioavailability caused by the metabolic inactivation of RA [36]. This finding supports the idea that CYP26A1 expression levels may play a role in determining cellular commitment to apoptosis. In this study, the expression of CYP26A1 in the liver was significantly down-regulated in the infected group. DHAV-C infection may induce an anti-apoptotic mechanism to facilitate viral propagation by suppressing CYP26A1 expression to the extension of RA biological activity. These results indicated that apoptosis resistance and apoptosis both existed during DHAV-C infection, proving that host–virus interaction is a dynamic process.\n\nInnate immune antiviral response first identifies pathogens through the pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors and then releases the related cytokine to induce an antiviral immune reaction. In this study, the common innate immune recognition receptors, such as TLRs, NLRs, and RIG-I-like receptors, were not screened. Only one member of the C-type lectin receptor gene family, AICL-like 2, was detected. AICL-like 2, is a member of the natural killer (NK) receptor subfamilies of C-type lectin. It was first found as an activation-induced receptor encoded by the human NK gene complex, predominantly in NK and hematopoietic cells [37]. Other subfamily members of C-type lectin receptors, such as DC-SIGN, L-SIGN and Dectin-1, recognize the pathogens as the innate immune receptor [38]. In addition, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have been proven to be major receptors of virus entry, which promote efficient viral replication in filoviruses and HIV infection [39], [40]. However, the exact function of AICL-like 2 and its pathogen recognition ability remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus can escape the attack of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by down-regulating the expression of C-type lectin receptors in NK cells, including AICL [41]. The down-regulation of AICL may also suppress tumor necrosis factor production by infected monocytes [42]. In this study, the expression level of AICL-like 2 was significantly down-regulated in the infected group, indicating that NK cell evasion may also exist in DHAV-C infection and may contribute to the ability of the virus to provide a reservoir for viral replication and transmission within the lesion.\n\nIFN is a cytokine with a wide spectrum of antiviral and immunoregulatory functions. IFN plays an important role in the host resistance to infection. However, direct IFN and IFN signaling genes were not screened. Only one novel IFN related to the LRRC3B gene was detected in this study. LRRC3Bis a novel gene cloned from lymphocytic cells in relapsed leukemia [43]. Previous studies showed that LRRC3B is regulated by DNA methylation [44] and plays an important role in DNA repair [45]. Recent studies have proven that it could be a putative tumor suppressor gene in many types of cancer in human [46]. Interestingly, the transfection and expression of LRRC3B in gastric cancer cell line showed that immune response-related genes and IFN signaling genes can be activated effectively [47], suggesting that LRRC3B may be involved in immune-related processes that trigger the innate immune response through activation of the IFN signaling pathway. However, the gene involved in virus infection has not been reported. In the present study, the expression of LRRC3B was significantly up-regulated in the infected group compared with the control group. The high expression of LRRC3B indicates that the host resisted the virus through the induction of immune response. However, the direct immune-related genes were not screened in this study. These findings may be attributed to the infection time and IFN signaling genes not induced in this infection stage.\n\nAside from the above four known genes, other four genes (CRP, L1CAM, ADAM32, and PCK1) with different features were also screened. CRP is an acute phase protein produced by hepatocytes predominantly in response to inflammation and infection [48]. The level of CRP is correlated with the infection progress and could be considered as a disease progression prognostic factor in many types of hepatitis virus infection in human, including hepatitis A, B, and C [49]–[52]. Interestingly, the present study showed that the expression of CRP was significantly down-regulated in the infected group. This finding agrees with several study results previously reported in human hepatitis C infection. CRP levels were proven to be significantly lower in HCV+ patients than in HCV- patients [53]. Therefore, DHAV-C infection could promote a disturbance in CRP production.\n\nL1CAM (also known as CD171), a member of the immunoglobulin super family, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates calcium-independent cell–cell adhesion [54]. L1CAM has long been characterized as a cell recognition molecule with an important role in the development of the nervous system [54]. Aside from the nervous system, recent studies have shown that L1CAM regulates the transendothelial migration and trafficking of dendritic cells (DCs). Under inflammatory conditions, the expression of L1CAM could enhance the transmigration of DCs [54]. In this study, the expression level of L1CAM was significantly down-regulated in the infected group. This phenomenon may be related to the resistance of the virus to host immunity by inhibition of transendothelial migration and trafficking of the DCs to escape the host antigen presentation.\n\nADAM32 is a member of the ADAM family. ADAMs are a family of transmembrane and secreted proteins that play important roles.in many biological processes, including sperm–egg interactions, cell migration, axon guidance, and muscle and nervous system development [55]. A recent study has shown that ADAM family members, as key responders to TGF-β1, could induce lesion-like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in alveolar epithelial cells under several stimulating conditions, including Epstein Barr virus infection [56]. ADAM32 is predominantly expressed in the testis and may play a role in sperm development or possibly fertilization [57]. However, its involvement in other biological processes is still unclear. In this study, the expression of ADAM32 was significantly declined compared with the control group, suggesting the deregulation of ADAM32 in DHAV-C infection. An important characteristic in DHV is liver injury, and the down-regulated expression of ADAM32 may be associated with the host reduce infection lesion.\n\nPCK1 (also known as PECK) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in gluconeogenesis. Hepatocytes play an important role in maintaining glucose homeostasis by regulating the balance between the hepatic gluconeogenic and glycolytic pathways [58]. PCK1 catalyzes a rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, which has become an important marker for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Recent studies have proven that the expression level of PCK1 is closely related to blood glucose control and diabetes development. Human Hepatitis C virus infection also causes liver diseases and extrahepatic manifestations, including metabolic disorders [59]. HCV promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis by significantly up-regulating the transcription of PCK1, leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in predisposed individuals [60]. In this study, the expression of PCK1 was significantly up-regulated in the virus infected group, which agrees with the results of previous studies in hepatitis C infection. The result indicates that hepatic gluconeogenesis, which leads to glucose abnormalities, also existed in DHAV-C early infection.\n\nIn summary, we explored the gene expression patterns in normal duck liver and the changes in gene transcription that are altered during DHAV-C early infection using de novo transcriptome sequencing. A total of 52,757 non-redundant unigenes were obtained, which contribute greatly to future studies on the duck genome. In addition, 20 differentially expressed unigenes (9 known genes and 11 novel unigenes) were screened during DHAV-C infection, which may serve as a basis for the discovery of new transcripts associated with infection and may provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of host–DHAV-C interaction in DHAV-C infection."
