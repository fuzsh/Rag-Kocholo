ACE‑2 was detected in immersion fixed paraffin-embedded sections of hamster lung using Goat Anti-Human/Mouse/Rat/Hamster ACE‑2 Antigen Affinity-purified Polyclonal Antibody (Catalog # AF933) at 3 µg/mL for 1 hour at room temperature followed by incubation with the Anti-Goat IgG VisUCyte™ HRP Polymer Antibody (VC004). Before incubation with the primary antibody, tissue was subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval using Antigen Retrieval Reagent-Basic (CTS013). Tissue was stained using DAB (brown) and counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Specific staining was localized to respiratory bronchioles. Staining was performed using our protocol for IHC Staining with VisUCyte HRP Polymer Detection Reagents.\n\nACE‑2 in Rat Lung.

The lentiviral backbone incorporates enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) that is expressed upon integration into target cells. The fluorescence was recorded at 48 h post transduction. Magnification 4X. (E) Transduction efficiency of pLV pseudotyped with CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein in Vero E6, hACE2-HEK293T and 293T cells. The fluorescence was recorded at 48 h post transduction. The experiments were done in triplicates and standard error of mean was plotted as error bars. (F) Whole cell lysates from Vero E6, hACE2-293T and 293T cells were run on SDS-PAGE and probed with anti ACE2 antibody. Beta-actin was used as a loading control.

Not internally tested by R&D Systems.\n\nDetection of Mouse ACE-2 by Western Blot Immunoblot analysis of ACE2 protein in the media from high glucose- or Ang II-stimulated mouse PT cells.(A) Mouse PT cells were incubated for 72 hrs in normal media (C, 7.8 mM D-glucose), with or without Ang II (10−7 M), high D-glucose (D-G, 25 mM), or high L-glucose (25 mM). Above graph is representative immunoblot for ACE2 in the media, showing bands at ∼90 kDa and ∼70 kDa. (B) Graphical representation of densitometry analysis of two ACE2 bands on immunoblots. For the ∼90 kDa band, *p<0.05 vs C, **p<0.001 vs C, **p<0.003 vs L-G; n = 5. For the ∼70 kDa band, *p<0.04 vs C; **p<0.001 vs C or L-G, **p<0.03 vs Ang II; n = 5.

Lanes 1 and 3: wildtype PT cells, Lanes 2 and 4: ACE2 knockout (KO) PT cells transfected with a human ACE2 vector, Lane 5: mouse kidney cortex. Lanes 1+ and 2+ show a reduction in the sizes of ACE2 fragments in media fractions to ∼75 kDa and ∼60 kDa for mouse ACE2, and to ∼80 kDa and ∼65 kDa for human ACE2, respectively. Lanes 3+ and 4+ show a reduction in the sizes of ACE2 in cell lysates to ∼85 kDa for both mouse and human ACE2 treated with the PNGase F, respectively. Lane 5+ shows a reduction in size of ACE2 in mouse cortex from ∼100 kDa to ∼85 kDa after treatment with PNGase F.

Lanes 1 and 4: wildtype cells, Lanes 2 and 5: ACE2 knockout (KO) cells, Lanes 3 and 6: ACE2 KO cells transfected with a human ACE2 expression vector, Lane 7: mouse kidney cortex showing a band at ∼100 kDa, used as a positive control. Lane 1 shows two bands in the media at ∼90 kDa and ∼70 kDa for mouse ACE2. Lane 3 shows two bands in the media for human ACE2 in transfected cells, at ∼110 kDa and ∼95 kDa. Lanes 4 and 6 show a single band in cell lysates at ∼100 kDa for mouse ACE2, and ∼120 kDa for human ACE2, respectively. Lanes 2 and 5 show no ACE2 bands detected on immunoblots of both media and cell lysates from untransfected ACE2 KO cells. (B) Increased ACE2 activity in the media from ACE2 KO cells transfected with a human ACE2 expression vector (HA-hACE2, 3.75 µg on 35 mm culture dishes). Untransfected cells and cells transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vector had no detectable ACE2 activity in the media. Numbers in parentheses represent mean values for ACE2 activity. *P<0.001 vs untransfected control or empty pcDNA3 vector, n = 4.
