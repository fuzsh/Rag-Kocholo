        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique and critical challenge for the world and a greater understanding of the mechanisms of disease overall and in different patient groups, is crucial in determining effective therapeutic responses that so far remain elusive. The SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein adheres to the ACE2 receptor and enters the host cell with the aid of the serine proteases, TMPRSS2, furin and CTSL by endocytosis (3, 5, 20). We have confirmed that ACE2 receptor gene and protein are present in AECs. We found expression is present in equal amounts in children and adults. Expression from lower airway cells is greater in older individuals and males. There appeared to be no differences with smoking or BMI. We also determined that ACE2 gene and protein levels were lower in subjects with asthma. This was also associated with reduced furin expression. Interestingly we also found increased ADAM-17 expression in the epithelium from subjects with asthma, demonstrating a potential mechanism through which IL-13-induced airway inflammation may down regulate ACE2 expression.\n\nViral respiratory tract infections are common triggers of acute asthma(27), and initially there was great concern that people with asthma would be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. This was the case during the last influenza pandemic in 2009 where asthma patients were overrepresented in those hospitalized with infection (28). Early reports from China (7) and Italy (14) though did not suggest that people with asthma were overrepresented in those hospitalized or who had died from SARS-CoV-2. Age, smoking and male sex though were associated with more severe disease (8). More recently the largest cohort review of more than 17,000 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 from the UK has been pre-published demonstrating that older age, being male, and social deprivation were strongly associated with mortality (29). While chronic lung disease, including COPD was associated with mortality, only those with asthma that had required the recent use of oral corticosteroids had increased mortality (29). We found increased ACE2 was associated with older age and male sex in two independent cohorts in keeping with the epidemiological studies. This suggests that increased lower airway ACE2 expression may be associated with increased risk of more severe disease, and this is consistent with increased ACE2 expression in the small airway epithelium from current smoker and those with COPD (11, 30). Asthma alone is not overrepresented in people with COVID-19 nor is it associated with greater disease severity. This raises the question as to why people with asthma are not at increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus transmitted by airway droplets (31). Cell entry is the first step necessary and cell tropism is key to infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor as its point of entry and this receptor has been found to be highly expressed in the upper airway (32, 33). Unlike other coronaviruses (OC43, 229E and NL63) that cause mild upper respiratory tract infections, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are able to spread to the lower respiratory tract resulting in pneumonia (34). While ACE2 is expressed in the lower respiratory tract, in keeping with our results, there is relatively lower levels of expression compared to the upper regions. SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect firstly ciliated columnar epithelial cells and then appears to spread to surrounding secretory cells (35). ACE2 expression is critical for lower airway infection to occur, and mice deficient in the receptor had greatly reduced SARS-CoV infection and replication (36). Thus, it is likely that the level of ACE2 expression in lower airway cells may be an important factor in determining more severe infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHigher pre-infection levels of ACE2 may lead to an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. This was proposed by Leung et al., where they demonstrated increased ACE2 expression from resected lung tissue and endobronchial brushings from 26 subjects who were current or former smokers as well as subjects with COPD (30). This phenomenon is seen with the relationship between infection and influenza strains between species where tropism for sialic acid residues determines the ability of influenza strains to be transmitted between species (37).\n\nThe entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into cells is facilitated by the interaction between viral S-protein with the extracellular domain of the transmembrane ACE2 protein. Endocytosis of the virus then results in downregulation of surface ACE2 expression (3, 38, 39). Once infection is established SARS-CoV has been shown to upregulate ADAM-17 that facilitates further viral endocytosis with ACE2, while knockdown of ADAM-17 by siRNA prior to infection substantially attenuates SARS-CoV entry (40). In 12 selected patients with COVID-19 and the 6 of these who developed ARDS, circulating angiotensin II levels were markedly elevated, which correlated with viral load as measured by PCR and the degree of pathology. This suggests a link in SARS-CoV-2 infection with tissue ACE2 downregulation facilitating the development of ARDS (41). The spread of infection to the lower airways is reflected in the clinical presentation of the illness, with the first 4-5 days often asymptomatic, followed by dry cough and fever, with viral load peaking at day 10, with those who go onto to develop severe disease, ARDS and severe systemic immune responses 7-10 days after infection (7, 42).\n\nThe biologic importance of reduced ACE2 gene expression and protein levels that we find in asthma is also supported by the observation of reduced expression of furin, a protease that together with TMPRSS2 has been found to be critical in facilitating SARS-COV-2 endocytosis (20). We also found enhanced expression of ADAM-17. Phosphorylation of ACE2 enhances its catalytic activity and increases its shedding from the epithelial surface (43). The role of ADAM-17 is not well defined in asthma but its presence in airway epithelial cells has been proposed to be anti-inflammatory and linked to increased airway remodelling and goblet cell hyperplasia (44). Enhanced ADAM-17 activity is a potential mechanism by which ACE2 receptor expression could be downregulated specifically in asthma.\n\nTwo other studies have examined reduced ACE2 mRNA expression in epithelial cells from people with asthma. Similar to us Jackson et al., showed reduced ACE2 expression in nasal samples from children and adults and bronchial epithelial cells from 10 steroid na√Øve allergic asthma patients (45). They demonstrated a negative correlation of ACE2 expression with type 2 airway inflammation, exhaled nitric oxide and nasal epithelial IL-13 expression.\n\nIn contrast Bradding et al examined bronchial brushings and endobronchial biopsies and looked for expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin(46). Results were available from 356 patients (88 healthy volunteers and 268 patients with asthma (mild to severe). They did not see any difference between participants with asthma or healthy controls but did find weak though statistically significant positive correlations between a TH-17 gene signature and negative correlation with a TH-2 gene signature. We saw reduced ACE2 expression in asthma, we not find a difference in ACE2 expression with atopy alone, nor did we see a significant relationship between ACE2 and bronchial lavage eosinophil count. Our cells had been cultured after harvest without stimulation. There is now evidence that treatment of AEC cultures with IL-13 reduces the expression of ACE2 (47). Interestingly it has been shown that IL-13 induced epithelial proliferation is mediated by ADAM-17 (48). This could provide a unifying mechanism by which the effect of IL-13 on tissue remodelling of the airway epithelium as occurs in severe allergic disease and asthma may lead to down regulation of ACE2 expression in the lower airways.\n\nIn contrast to our results increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found in over 300 induced sputum samples from a cohort with severe asthma, though the use of inhaled steroids was associated with lower ACE2 expression (49). These results however are from induced sputum and the RNA content will have largely come from immune cells and not the airway epithelium. Interferons have also been shown to influence ACE2 expression, and it is possible that a deficient interferon response in asthma, may be associated with reduced airway expression of ACE2(50). Another alternate possibility is that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may reduce ACE2 expression. All our participants with asthma were on ICS and the majority were taking moderate to high doses. We did not see a negative correlation between ICS dose and ACE2 expression and subjects on ICS independent of asthma did not have lower ACE2 expression. The effect of ICS on antiviral immunity is unclear and there is as yet no data to determine if the risk with COVID-19 is increased or decreased (51).\n\nOur study has some weaknesses. We examined specimens of AECs from a relatively large cohort, who were recruited to study chronic airways disease and were enriched for subjects with moderate to severe asthma and COPD. Our numbers overall and with asthma though were not large enough to give a clear answer with multivariate analysis to define if this was independent of age and sex, and it is likely we would need to have included younger people with asthma. All of our subjects were on ICS and had required either GINA step 3 or above treatment. The majority, 28/39(72%) had evidence of type 2 high airway inflammation, with either atopy or elevated airway eosinophils. We had relatively few participants with other diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease and relatively few on ACE inhibitors, meaning we cannot make any reliable predictions about these groups.\n\nSimilarly, we had relatively few current smokers, though a larger number of former smokers, and the effect may have been confounded by the fact that all these smokers had been selected because of chronic airways disease. ACE2 expression and associated proteases are but one factor that will be associated with susceptibility to infection. Similarly, the risk of severe disease or the development of complications from COVID-19 will be more complex than receptor expression alone for the virus.\n\nWe present the largest pathology study that looks at ACE2 expression from lower airway bronchial epithelial cells enriched with people with asthma and COPD. We have confirmed the presence of ACE2 in samples from children and adults in two independent cohorts and determined with bivariate analysis that age and male sex is associated with increased lower airway ACE2 expression. Our data provides further evidence for the differences observed in RNA expression confirming reduced ACE2 protein levels in subjects with asthma by immunohistochemistry. We are now the second group to find that people with asthma have reduced ACE2 expression in lower airway cells. We propose that this may provide a degree of protection from the complications of SARS-CoV-2. The next step is to determine from current epidemiological studies of COVID transmission what is the risk of infection in asthma and whether these people are relatively protected. We find reduced ACE2 expression associated with reduced furin expression in asthma and observe increased expression of ADAM-17. This provides a potential mechanism by which chronic airway inflammation associated with asthma and the action of IL-13 on the airway epithelium could down regulate ACE2 expression via ADAM17 prior to infection. Further studies should now be done to define this mechanism and determine whether this can be manipulated as a therapeutic target to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection of the airway epithelium."
