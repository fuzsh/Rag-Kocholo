        "text": "This is the family line of Anthony Collett from Earls Barton in Northamptonshire,\n\nthe line of descent denoted by the names in capital letters.\n\nBy May 2010 the size of this file was such that it was too large for emailing, so\n\nit was therefore decided to separate the details and provide two files,\n\none for the village of Wolvercote and one for the village of Combe.\n\nAs the title indicates, this line is inextricably linked to the prominent family occupation of being stonemasons and affects the families in the Oxfordshire villages of Wolvercote and Combe. There are clues that perhaps suggest the families in these two villages are related but for now they are shown as two separate families.\n\nThe information in the revised version issued in May 2010 was kindly provided by Brian Taylor\n\nand relates to Mary Anne Collett (Ref. 38N8), about whom nothing was previously known\n\nIt is thanks to Sue Massen, the daughter of Helen Annie May Collett (Ref. 38R8), that\n\nthis file was previously updated with new details going back to Henry Collett (Ref. 38P4)\n\nPart 37  The Oxford City Line is the family line of Kevin Mark Collett (Ref. 37S4) who, on 2nd September 2006 married Lynda Davies whose own family had early Collett ancestors. This second Oxford Line is therefore an attempt to prove the earlier link between the two families\n\nThanks therefore go to Lyndas father Martin Davies (Ref. 38Q34) of Stourton in the West Midlands who provided the initial family information that has enabled this line to be developed, the line denoted by the underlined names.\n\nSECTION ONE  WOLVERCOTE (1784 to 1945)\n\nJames Collett (Ref. 38M8), who starts this family line, was the youngest son of Thomas (Ref. 38L1) and Elizabeth Collett of Combe, whose complete Combe family feature in Section Two  Combe\n\n38M8\n\nJAMES COLLETT was born at Combe in 1784 and it was there that he was baptised on 7th November 1784. He was a stonemason, a trade that was passed along to at least four of his five sons. He married Mary Ladson at St Ebbes in Oxford on 16th April 1809. Mary was born at Wolvercote in 1786 where she was baptised on 26th March 1786. Wolvercote lies immediately to the north of the City of Oxford and it was there that the couple set up home and where all nine of their children were born and baptised.\n\nIn the first national census of 1841 the family living at Wolvercote was recorded as James Collett who was 57, his wife Mary Collett who was 55, and just four of their nine children. They were Matthew, who was 19, Charles, who was 15, Mary, who was 13, and Emma who was eight years old. Over the next decade, all bar one of their child left the family home in Wolvercote so, in 1851, it was just James aged 66, with his wife Mary who was 65, and their youngest child Emma who was 18. Sadly, it was four year later that their daughter Emma died and was buried at Wolvercote in 1855.\n\nUnfortunately, it would seem that, no records for Wolvercote, and in particular for any member of the Collett family, are available from the census conducted in 1861 when it is well established that there were many of them living there on that occasion. However, it is known that James Collett had been killed in a tragic accident just three months before the day of that census, although his wife Mary may still have been alive. James was still working as a stonemason when he fell to his death from scaffolding on which he was still working. He died during December 1860 and the Wolvercote parish burial record stated that he was buried in the parish churchyard on 19th December 1860 at the age of 76.\n\n38N1\n\nElizabeth Collett\n\nBaptised on 15.04.1810 at Wolvercote\n\n38N2\n\nJames Collett\n\nBorn in 1812 at Wolvercote\n\n38N3\n\nJoseph Collett\n\nBaptised on 02.12.1815 at Wolvercote\n\n38N4\n\nAnn Collett\n\nBaptised on 05.05.1818 at Wolvercote\n\n38N5\n\nWilliam Collett\n\nBaptised on 31.10.1819 at Wolvercote\n\n38N6\n\nMatthew Collett\n\nBaptised on 01.09.1822 at Wolvercote\n\n38N7\n\nCHARLES COLLETT\n\nBaptised on 18.09.1825 at Wolvercote\n\n38N8\n\nMary Anne Collett\n\nBaptised on 22.06.1828 at Wolvercote\n\n38N9\n\nEmma Collett\n\nBorn in 1832 at Wolvercote\n\n38N2\n\nJames Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1812 where he was baptised on 17th May 1812 and where he worked as a stonemason like his father and his brothers. He married Sarah Woodward at Wolvercote on 7th October 1833. Sarah was also born at Wolvercote in 1812 and it was there that they lived all of their life and where their eight children were born and baptised.\n\nThat was just one of four marriages between the Collett and the Woodward families, the other three being listed in SECTION TWO - COMBE. They were Phoebe Woodward, who was born in 1801, who married (1) William Collett (Ref. 38n5), who later married (2) Richard Collett (Ref. 38n9), and Rachel Woodward, who was born in 1822 who also married the aforementioned Richard Collett (Ref. 38n9)\n\nIn 1841 James, a mason, and Sarah were both 29 when they were living at Wolvercote with their first three children, William who was six, Joseph who was four, and Ann who was just one year old. According to the same census record, living in the house next door to James and Sarah were William Collett (below) and his wife Sarah, William being James brother.\n\nBy the time of the 1851 Census for Wolvercote, the family was still living there and had increased in size by the addition of four more children. Head of the household was named as Jas Collett aged 39, who was a mason, and his wife Sarah was also 39. Six children were living with them and they were Wm Collett who was 16, Jos Collett who was 13, Jas Collett who was seven, Anne Collett who was five, Eliza Collett who was three, and Emma Collett who was only eleven months old. Every member of the family was listed as having been born at Wolvercote.\n\nSometime during the year following the 1851 Census Sarah gave birth to the couples last child Julia. However, it seems very curious that no member of the family has been positively identified within the next census of 1861, particularly as they were back living in Wolvercote in 1871. On that occasion James Collett was 59 and a stonemason, Sarah was also 59, and by then just two of their children were still living with them. They were Sarah A Collett, who was 25 and a domestic servant, and Julia Collett who was 18. Ten years later the census in 1881 confirmed that all of the children of James and Sarah had left the family home except for their youngest child Julia.\n\nThe census return that year stated that stonemason James Collett and his wife Sarah were both 69. Both were confirmed as having been born at Wolvercote, while they were living in a house on the main road through the village simply referred to as village street. Living with them was the aforementioned daughter Julia Collett, who was unmarried at 28, who appeared to be looking after her elderly parents as she was not credited with an occupation. Also listed in the 1881 census with them were two grandchildren of head of the household James. Joseph Collett was 21 and a stonemason, while his sister Mary A Collett was 16, and both of whom had been born at Wolvercote.\n\nJoseph Collett (Ref. 38P3) and Mary A Collett (Ref. 38P6) were two of the fourteen children of James and Sarahs eldest son William Collett who lived close by in Wolvercote. It was very likely due to overcrowding in Williams home, together with the fact his wife was due to give birth to the couples last child, that had forced Joseph and Mary to go and live with their grandparents.\n\nOver the following entries in this family line, it will be noted that eight individual Collett families were recorded as living in houses along the main village street in Wolvercote in 1881, indicating the prominence of the family within the local community.\n\n38O1\n\nWilliam Collett\n\nBorn in 1834 at Wolvercote\n\n38O2\n\nJoseph Collett\n\nBorn in 1836 at Wolvercote\n\n38O3\n\nAnn Collett\n\nBorn in 1839 at Wolvercote\n\n38O4\n\nJames Collett\n\nBorn in 1843 at Wolvercote\n\n38O5\n\nSarah Anne Collett\n\nBorn in 1845 at Wolvercote\n\n38O6\n\nEliza Collett\n\nBorn in 1847 at Wolvercote\n\n38O7\n\nEmma Collett\n\nBorn in 1850 at Wolvercote\n\n38O8\n\nJulia Collett\n\nBorn in 1852 at Wolvercote\n\n38N3\n\nJoseph Collett was baptised at Wolvercote on 2nd December 1815. And it was there that he died and was buried on 22nd March 1835, nine months before his twentieth birthday.\n\n38N4\n\nAnn Collett was baptised at Wolvercote on 5th May 1818 and where, later that same year she died and was buried on 22nd September 1818.\n\n38N5\n\nWilliam Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1819 and was baptised there on 31st October 1819. His occupation was that of a stonemason just like his brothers. It was just prior to June 1841 that he married Sarah Ann Langford, a young lady who was a year older than William, having been born at Wolvercote during 1818. The couple lived the majority of their life in Wolvercote, where all of their children were born and where in 1841 William and Sarah were living right next door to Williams brother James Collett (above) and his wife Sarah.\n\nThe 1851 Census for Wolvercote revealed that William Collett was 32 and a stonemason, while his wife was recorded as S A Collett who was 32, both of them born at Wolvercote. By that time their marriage had produced three children, daughter M Collett who was four, J W Collett who was two, and E Collett who was ten months old. Over the next decade three more children were added to their family and they were Daniel, Henry and Rhoda, although as with Williams older brother James (above), no record of either family has been located within the census of 1861. After a further ten years stonemason William Collett was 51, Sarah A Collett was 52, and the only children living with them Wolvercote were Daniel Collett who was 18 and also a stonemason, Henry Collett who was 13, and Rhoda Collett who was nine years old, all born at Wolvercote. The couples three oldest children Mary, James and Frederick had already left the family home by then. Living just one house away at that time was Williams brother Matthew (below).\n\nBy the time of the next census in 1881, when every member of the household had been born at Wolvercote, William Collett was 61 and a stonemason, Sarah A Collett was 62, while their two youngest and unmarried children were Henry Collett who was 23 and a master carpenter, and Rhoda Collett who was 19 and a dressmaker. Also living with the family at Wolvercote that day were two of the couples grandchildren, and they were Lydia Robinson who was nine and the child of their married daughter Mary, and Horace J Collett who was one year old and the base-born son of the couples youngest daughter Rhoda.\n\nSadly, it was five years later that Sarah Ann Collett nee Langford died at Wolvercote, the event recorded at Woodstock register office (Ref. 3a 583) during the first quarter of 1886 when her age was noted as being 67. William Collett survived his wife and was still living at Wolvercote, on the High Street in 1891 at the age of 71, when he was a dairyman who had living with him his two unmarried daughters Emma Collett who was 39 and Rhoda Collett who was 29. Also living at the same address were two of Williams grandchildren, Frederick W Robinson aged 29 and another dairyman, and Horace J Collett who was 11, who had been one year old ten years earlier. Frederick was the son of Williams eldest married daughter Mary. Just less than three years after that, the death of William Collett was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 147) during the first quarter of 1894, when he was 74.\n\n38O9\n\nMary E Collett\n\nBorn in 1846 at Wolvercote\n\n38O10\n\nJames William Collett\n\nBorn in 1848 at Wolvercote\n\n38O11\n\nEmma Collett\n\nBorn in 1850 at Wolvercote\n\n38O12\n\nDaniel Collett\n\nBorn in 1852 at Wolvercote\n\n38O13\n\nEmily Collett\n\nBorn in 1857 at Wolvercote\n\n38O14\n\nHenry Collett\n\nBorn in 1858 at Wolvercote\n\n38O15\n\nRhoda Collett\n\nBorn in 1861 at Wolvercote\n\n38N6\n\nMatthew Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1822 where he was baptised on 1st September 1822, the son of James Collett and his wife Mary Ladson. He was 19 in the census of 1841 when he was the oldest of the four children still living at Wolvercote with his parents. He too followed in the family tradition by becoming a stonemason and it was just over six years later that he married Ann Collett, from Combe, their wedding recorded at the Headington (Ref. xvi 22) during the last quarter of 1847.\n\nFor details of the family of Ann Collett of Combe see Section Two  Combe (Ref. 38o11)\n\nAnn Collett was born at Combe and was baptised there on 29th October 1820, her marriage to Matthew Collett of Wolvercote proving to be another link between the two villages. Ann was the daughter of Thomas Collett and Sophia Smith who were married at Combe, just nine days before Ann was baptised and presumably just prior to the birth. Matthew and Ann lived all their life in the village of Wolvercote, where all of their children were born. By the time of the census in 1851 Ann had presented Matthew with their first two children. The census return that year recorded the young family as Mathew Collett aged 28 and a mason, Ann Collett who was 30 and from Combe, T J Collett who was two and born at Summertown, and J Collett who was three months old and born at Wolvercote, where the family of four was living that day.\n\nWith no census information available for Wolvercote in 1861, the family had greatly increased in size by 1871, even though the couples eldest daughter, who was 17, was living and working within the city of Oxford by then. Still together in Wolvercote were Matthew, aged 48 who was a stonemason, his wife Ann who was 50 and of Combe, Thomas J Collett aged 22, Joseph aged 20 and a stonemason, Alfred aged 15 and a servant, Annie S Collett who was 13, John who was 10, and Edwin who was eight. Their youngest son Benjamin, who was four years old, was not with his family that day but was with them in 1881. The census in 1871 also revealed that Matthew and his family were living just one house away from his brother William (above) and his family in Wolvercote.\n\nWithin the next ten years another three of their children left the family home so, by the time of the 1881 Census, the family had reduced to being just Matthew and Ann and their four youngest sons. At that time in April 1881 the family was living at village street just a few doors along the road from Matthews brother William and his son Frederick. Matthew was 59, Ann was 60, while their sons were Alfred who was 25, John who was 20, Edwin who was 18 and Benjamin who was 14 years of age.\n\nMatthew and Ann were still together in 1891, by which time all of their children had left the family home in Wolvercote and Matthew was 68 and Ann was 70. Ann must have died sometime during the last decade of the century, since Matthew was still living at Wolvercote in March 1901 when he was a widower and a retired stonemason at the age of 78. It was not long after that when Matthew Collett also passed away.\n\n38O16\n\nThomas James Collett\n\nBorn in 1848 at Wolvercote\n\n38O17\n\nJoseph Collett\n\nBorn in 1850 at Wolvercote\n\n38O18\n\nElizabeth Mary Collett\n\nBorn in 1853 at Wolvercote\n\n38O19\n\nAlfred Collett\n\nBorn in 1855 at Wolvercote\n\n38O20\n\nAnnie Sophia Collett\n\nBorn in 1858 at Wolvercote\n\n38O21\n\nJohn Collett\n\nBorn in 1860 at Wolvercote\n\n38O22\n\nEdwin Collett\n\nBorn in 1862 at Wolvercote\n\n38O23\n\nBenjamin Collett\n\nBorn in 1866 at Wolvercote\n\n38N7\n\nCHARLES COLLETT was born at Wolvercote in 1825 and it was there that he was baptised on 18th September 1825. He was 15 at the time of the census in 1841 when he was still living with his parents in Wolvercote, by which time he had left school and had taken up the occupation of a stonemason. It may have been through his work that Charles met his future wife in the neighbouring county of Northamptonshire, where Ann Bell was baptised at Benefield on 6th March 1825, the daughter of Robert and Susanna Bell. As a result, the marriage of Charles and (1) Ann was recorded at Oundle, near Benefield, during the second quarter of 1848 (Ref. xv 35). Ann presented Charles with six children, before her untimely death in 1863, when she was buried at Wolvercote in September that year. However, it was only the first two of those six children that had been born by the time the census was conducted in 1851. The Wolvercote census return that year, listed the family as Charles Collett who was 25 and a mason, Ann Collett from Benefield who was also 25, Fk Collett who was one year old and Charles Collett (junior) who was only one month old. All three male members of the household had been born at Wolvercote.\n\nThe next four children were also born at Wolvercote, after which their mother died, perhaps even during the birth of a seventh child, who also did not survive. All six children were baptised at Wolvercote, when the parents were confirmed as Charles Collett, a mason, and his wife Ann. Unfortunately, no record of the family at Wolvercote has been found in 1861. Widowed Charles Collett, with six children to care for, then married (2) Elizabeth Butler Simms, who was made a widow when her twenty-nine-year-old husband died at The Friars in Oxford on 15th May 1864, with whom she already had a son. The marriage of Charles and Elizabeth was recorded at Oxford (Ref. 3a 229) during the third quarter of 1866. Elizabeth was originally an Oxford girl, and the former wife of cellarman Robert Simms, who was born Elizabeth Butler Harris, the daughter of Joseph and Maria Harris of Lucas Yard, and baptised at St Giles on 22nd June 1836. Prior to marrying Charles, Elizabeth had been living at Camden Town in London when her son John Simms was born on 14th March 1861 and baptised there on 12th May 1861.\n\nIn 1871 Charles Collett from Wolvercote was still living there at the age of 45, when his occupation was confirmed as being that of a mason. Living with him was his much younger wife Elizabeth from Oxford who was 35, with her son John Simms who was 10 years old and described as son-in-law (stepson) to head of the household Charles. Also living with the family were Charles two sons, Charles Collett junior, who was 20 and a mason, and Walter Collett, who was 16 and a carpenter and a joiner, together with his daughter Eliza Collett, who was nine years old. All three children born at Wolvercote. Living in the adjoining dwellings, one on both sides of Collett home, were other members of the Collett family. On one side was Charles eldest son Frederick Robert Collett with his wife Elizabeth and their son Frederick junior, while on the other side was Charles nephew James Collett (Ref. 38O4) and his young wife Elizabeth.\n\nAfter a further ten years, according to the census in 1881, Charles Collett was 55 and a stonemason of Wolvercote who was living at village street with wife Elizabeth aged 44. Living with them was Charles stepson John Simms aged 19, who was working at one of the university colleges as a domestic servant. Also listed with them was one-year-old Alfred Collett who had been born at Wolvercote and was described as the grandson of Charles Collett. He was the base-born son of Charles and Anns unmarried daughter Emily Collett and continued to live with his grandfather, even after he was widowed, until he was old enough to make his own way in life.\n\nTen years later, Charles Collett was 65 in the Wolvercote census of 1891 when he and his wife Elizabeth aged 54, still had their eleven-year-old grandson Alfred Collett living with them. In March 1901 Charles and Elizabeth were still living at Wolvercote. By then Charles was 76 and Elizabeth from the Parish of St Giles in Oxford was 64, by which time the couples grandson had left their home a few years earlier. It was just a few months later, that same year, when the death of Charles Collett was recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 307) during the third quarter of 1901. When his Will was proved at Oxford on 2nd October 1901, the three beneficiaries were named as Elizabeth Collett, his widow, Frederick Robert Collett, his son, and John Sims stepson. The probate documents also confirmed that he passed away on July 19th August 1901. By the time of the census in 1911, Elizabeth Collett aged 74 and a widow was still residing at Lower Wolvercote. Fifteen years after that census day, the death of Elizabeth B Collett was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 1277) during the first three months of 1926, when she was still 89.\n\n38O24\n\nFrederick Robert Collett\n\nBorn in 1849 at Wolvercote\n\n38O25\n\nCHARLES THOMAS COLLETT\n\nBorn in 1851 at Wolvercote\n\n38O26\n\nClara Ann Collett\n\nBorn in 1852 at Wolvercote\n\n38O27\n\nWalter Collett\n\nBorn in 1854 at Wolvercote\n\n38O28\n\nEmily Collett\n\nBorn in 1857 at Wolvercote\n\n38O29\n\nEliza Collett\n\nBorn in 1861 at Wolvercote\n\n38N8\n\nMary Anne Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1827 where she was baptised on 22nd June 1828, the daughter of James Collett and Mary Ladson. It was simply as Mary Collett aged 13, that she was just one of four children still living with her parents at Wolvercote in 1841. Ten years later Mary was 23 when she was again living in the village, although by then her father had been dead for just three months. Mary Anne Collett was 24 when she married William Saxton at Wolvercote on 29th November 1852. William was a blacksmith and a farrier and worked at the paper-mill in the village.\n\nThe marriage produced ten children for the couple, one of whom was Annie Saxton who was born in 1865, who later married Charles Taylor at Wolvercote on 18th September 1897. This is the family line of Brian Taylor who kindly provided the details of the life of his great grandmother Mary Anne Collett and her family. At the time of the census in 1871 the family was listed as William Saxton, age 46, Mary who was 41, and their children William Saxton aged 18, Henry Saxton aged 17, Eliza Saxton aged 11, Sarah Saxton who was eight, Edith Saxton who was seven, Annie Saxton who was five, and Kate Saxton who was three. During the following year Mary Anne presented William with their last child Albert Saxon.\n\nBy 1881 the majority of the children had left the family home which, by that time was at Mill Road in Wolvercote. William was 56 and was described as a blacksmith at the paper-mill, his wife Mary was 53 and was a paper sorter at the mill, and just three of their children were still living with them. They were Mary Saxton 23, an unemployed domestic servant, Kate Saxton 13, and Albert Saxton who was nine.\n\nDuring their later life together at Wolvercote, Mary Anne and William lived at 93 Godstow Road where William had a forge in the outbuildings. Mary Anne Saxton nee Collett died during April 1889 and was buried at Wolvercote on 22nd April 1889. William survived for another seventeen years, but on his death in 1906 the house at 93 Godstow Road was taken over by Charles and Annie Taylor nee Saxton who raised their family there. Curiously the census in 1901 placed William Saxton of Wolvercote living in the Cowley area of Oxford at the age of 76.\n\nAt a later time, on the occasion of the marriage on Charles and Annies son, the outbuildings were demolished and replaced with a new home that was 95 Godstow Road, which today stands on the corner of Rowland Close. In addition to the forge at 93 Godstow Road, the Saxon family of blacksmiths also operated a forge at the Red Lion Public House in Wolvercote. All of the above information on the life and family of Mary Anne Saxton has been kindly provided by her great grandson Brian Taylor.\n\n38N9\n\nEmma Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1832 or 1833 and was baptised there a little later during June 1834, the youngest child of James Collett and Mary Ladson. She was eight years old in the census of 1841, and was 18 in 1851 when she was still living at Wolvercote with her elderly parents. It was just over four years later that she tragically died at Wolvercote, where she was buried on 29th October 1855.\n\n38O1\n\nWilliam Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1834, the eldest child of James Collett and his wife Sarah Woodward. As Wm Collett, aged 16, he was still living with his family in 1851, following which he eventually entered the family business and became a stonemason. He married Mary Ann Jones at Wolvercote on 5th January.1856, where Mary had also been born during 1836 the daughter of shoemaker William Jones. The marriage produced sixteen children for the couple, although only fifteen are listed below. All of the children were born at Wolvercote, and they all lived at village street in Wolvercote until they left the family home, as confirmed by the census returns for 1871, 1881 and 1891.\n\nAccording to the census of 1871 William Collett was 36 and Mary A Collett was 34. Their children at that time were William aged 14, Ellen aged 13, Joseph aged 11, Henry aged 10, George who was eight, Mary A Collett who was six, Edward who was five, Vincent who was two, and Emma who was one year old. Ten years later Mary was pregnant with the couples last, having already given birth to a further five children during the 1870s. The census therefore recorded the family in 1881 as William, who was 46, his wife Mary A Collett, who was 44, together with ten of the fourteen children up to that time. They were Henry aged 20, George aged 18, Edward aged 15, Vincent aged 12, Emma aged 11, Ellis who was nine, Lydia who was seven, Edith who was five, Thomas who was four, and Agnes who was two.\n\nThe two eldest children, William and Ellen, had already left the family home prior to April 1881, William to be married, and Ellen who was employed in domestic service in Oxford. The other two missing children were Joseph and Mary A Collett who were both living nearby in Wolvercote with their grandparents to ease the overcrowded Collett household. Ten years later in 1891 the family was somewhat reduced. William was 56 and Mary was 54, and the only children still living with them at Wolvercote were Edward who was 24, Ellis who was 19, Lydia who was 18, Thomas who was 13, Agnes who was 11, and latest arrival Gertrude, who was nine years old. By that time Williams daughter Emma had given birth to a base-born son during 1889, but was married by 1891, although she had not married the boys father.\n\nBy March 1901 William was 66 and was still working as a stonemason at Wolvercote. There was no record of his wife in the census that year, so it is assumed that William had been widowed sometime during the 1890s. It would appear that William passed away sometime during the next few years since no record of him has been found in the census of 1911. It is interesting that the brother of Mary Ann Collett nee Jones, Henry, was living with her eldest son William James Collett from before 1891 until after 1911, first at Wolvercote and then at Bampton.\n\n38P1\n\nWilliam James Collett\n\nBorn in 1856 at Wolvercote\n\n38P2\n\nEllen Collett\n\nBorn in 1858 at Wolvercote\n\n38P3\n\nJoseph Collett\n\nBorn in 1859 at Wolvercote\n\n38P4\n\nHenry Collett\n\nBorn in 1860 at Wolvercote\n\n38P5\n\nGeorge Collett\n\nBorn in 1862 at Wolvercote\n\n38P6\n\nMary A Collett\n\nBorn in 1864 at Wolvercote\n\n38P7\n\nEdward Collett\n\nBorn in 1865 at Wolvercote\n\n38P8\n\nVincent Collett\n\nBorn in 1868 at Wolvercote\n\n38P9\n\nEmma Collett\n\nBorn in 1869 at Wolvercote\n\n38P10\n\nEllis Collett\n\nBorn in 1871 at Wolvercote\n\n38P11\n\nLydia Collett\n\nBorn in 1873 at Wolvercote\n\n38P12\n\nEdith Collett\n\nBorn in 1875 at Wolvercote\n\n38P13\n\nThomas Herbert Collett\n\nBorn in 1876 at Wolvercote\n\n38P14\n\nAgnes E Collett\n\nBorn in 1878 at Wolvercote\n\n38P15\n\nGertrude Doris Collett\n\nBorn in 1881 at Wolvercote\n\n38O2\n\nJoseph Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1836, the son of James and Sarah Collett, who by 1851 was 13 and was recorded with his family as Jos Collett from Wolvercote. It is more than likely that he was a stonemason like his father, the profession also being taken up by his eldest son. When in his early twenties he met and married Lavinia Lindsey who was born at Witney in 1836. The wedding ceremony took place around 1858 and by 1871 the marriage had produced four children for Joseph and Lavinia and all of them born while the family was living at nearby Summertown in north Oxford.\n\nIn April 1871 Joseph and Lavinia were living in the Headington & St Clements area of Oxford where they were both 33 years old. Lavinia was expecting the imminent birth of their fourth child on the day of the census, while their three previous children were listed as Henry J Collett, who was 11, Samuel T Collett, who was seven, and Ernest H Collett who was five years old. Tragically for the family, it was around his fortieth birthday, that Joseph Collett died on 13th November 1876 from cirrhosis of the liver while living at Rose Cottage on Banbury Road in Summertown.\n\nApproximately one year after the death of her husband, Lavinia married another stonemason, Richard Stroud. Richard was fifteen years older than Lavinia and had been born at Wootton, north of Woodstock in Oxfordshire. Shortly after they were married Richard and Lavinia were living within the Iffley area of south Oxford, where their son Frank Stroud was born in 1878. Just after he was born the family had moved again, that time to Howard Street in the Cowley district of the City of Oxford where they were living in 1881.Howard Street runs between Iffley Road (A4158) and Cowley Road to the east and is virtually the same today as it was at that time.\n\nLiving with Richard, aged 59, and Lavinia Stroud, aged 44, and their son Frank Stroud, who was two years old, were two of the children of the late Joseph Collett, they being his son Samuel Collett and his daughter Lavinia Collett. Of his other two children missing from the 1881 census return, his son Ernest was serving in the navy, but it is not known what had happened to Henry. Lavinia was expecting the birth of Richard Strouds second child on the day of the census in 1881, which was confirmed in the following census of 1891. The family was still living within the Headington St Clements district of Oxford where Richard Stroud was 71, Lavinia Stroud was 53, and their two sons were Frank R Stroud aged 12 and George W Stroud who was nine.\n\n38P16\n\nHenry J Collett\n\nBorn in 1859 at Summertown, Oxford\n\n38P17\n\nSamuel Thomas Collett\n\nBorn in 1863 at Summertown, Oxford\n\n38P18\n\nErnest Henry Collett\n\nBorn in 1865 at Summertown, Oxford\n\n38P19\n\nLavinia J Collett\n\nBorn in 1870 at Summertown, Oxford\n\n38O3\n\nAnn Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1839 but died in 1842 and was buried at Wolvercote on 3rd September 1842, the daughter of James and Sarah Collett.\n\n38O4\n\nJames Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1843, his birth recorded at Woodstock (Ref. xvi 1) during the third quarter if the year. It was as Jas Collett, that he was seven years old in the census of 1851. Unlike other members of his family who had entered the traditional family business of being a stonemason, James took up the profession of clock and watch maker. It was at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 85) during the second quarter of 1870, when James Collett married Elizabeth who was eight years younger than James, having been born at Woodstock in 1851. Once married they settled in Wolvercote, where they were living in 1871 when James was 27 and a watch and clock maker and his wife was 19. Elizabeth was already awaiting the birth of their first child who was born shortly after the census day that year. The two adjacent dwellings on one side of the home of James and Elizabeth Collett were occupied by the families of James uncle Charles Collett (Ref. 38N7) right next door, and Charles eldest son, cousin Frederick Robert Collett (Ref. 38O24).\n\nAt least two more children were born to the couple during the following decade, with the larger family still living in Wolvercote in 1881. According to the census that year James was 37 and Elizabeth was 29 when they were living with their three children at Woodview Cottages in Wolvercote, where Elizabeth was employed at the local paper-mill in Wolvercote as a rag cutter. Their children on that occasion were their daughters Blanche, who was nine, and Evelyn, who was seven, and their son Charles James who was one year old. The fact that no further children were added to the family for almost another ten years raises an interesting possibility, bearing in mind what happened next to the family.\n\nWith Elizabeth being eight years younger than James, there is a chance that a liaison with another man resulted in the birth of her last child. On discovering that his wife had been unfaithfully, James may have assaulted the gentleman concerned, and it may have been that action which caused him to be jailed during the first few years of the child life. All of this is purely supposition in the absence of anything more positive.\n\nWhat is known for sure, is that by the time the child was born in 1889, Elizabeth had been moved to the Oxford Union Workhouse following the familys eviction from the house in Woodview Cottages, when her husband was incarcerated in jail. Due to his misdemeanour, hereto not confirmed, James Collett spent time in the Oxford H M Prison on New Road in the city and was recorded as still being there at the time of the census of 1891 when he was 47. At that same time in their lives, James wife Elizabeth was an inmate at the Oxford Union Workhouse, where she was recorded as Elizabeth Collett who was 39. Listed there with her, at the workhouse in the St Clement area of the city, was her son Roland who was two years old, who was described as Roland of Summertown.\n\nAs regards to the couples eldest child, Blanche Collett was 19 and was employed as the only general domestic servant at the home of baker William Lanburn and his seamstress wife Elizabeth at 3 St Mary's Road in the Cowley district of Oxford.\n\nJust after the start of the new century, James and Elizabeth were living at Littlemore in the Rose Hill area of Cowley, two miles south of Oxford city. According to the census return for 1901, James Collett, aged 57 and from Wolvercote, was continuing to work as a watch and clock matcher, while Elizabeth was 49 and a laundress also from Wolvercote. Still living with the couple were two of their children and they were Evelyn Collett, who was 27 and from Wolvercote who was a packer at a laundry, and Roland H Collett who was 11 and born at Summertown in Oxford. During the next decade Elizabeth passed away, and by 1911, James Collett of Wolvercote was 67 when he was still living at Littlemore with his unmarried daughter Evelyn who was 37, and his youngest son Roland who was 21 years of age. James was described as a widower and a former watch and clock maker, who was currently unemployed. Five years later, the death of James Collett, of Wolvercote, was recorded at Headington register office (Ref. 3a 1270) during the last three months of 1916, when he was 73.\n\n38P20\n\nBlanche Collett\n\nBorn in 1871 at Wolvercote\n\n38P21\n\nEvelyn Collett\n\nBorn in 1874 at Wolvercote\n\n38P22\n\nCharles James Collett\n\nBorn in 1880 at Wolvercote\n\n38P23\n\nRoland Herbert Collett\n\nBorn in 1890 at Summertown\n\n38O5\n\nSarah Anne Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1845, the daughter of James and Sarah Collett. At the time of the Wolvercote census in 1851 her parents informed the census enumerator that she was Anne Collett who was five years old and born Wolvercote. No record of the family has so far been found in 1861, but they were still living in Wolvercote in 1871, when Sarah A Collett, aged 25, was a domestic servant and one of only two children still living there with their parents. It seems very likely that she was married prior to 1881, since there was no record of a Sarah Anne Collett of Wolvercote at that time.\n\n38O7\n\nEmma Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1850 and was baptised there on 19th May 1850. She was eleven months old in the census of 1851. Her location in 1871 has not been determined, but when she was 30, she was unmarried and was working as a live-in housemaid and servant at the homes of 68-year-old master draper John C Cavell at his extensive properties at 11 to 12 Magdalen Street and 1 to 2 Friars Entry in the St Mary Magdalen district of Oxford.Both addresses were just off Cornmarket Street and Broad Street in the centre of the city centre and are still there today - see note below. In the mid-1900s, and perhaps for many decades earlier, there was a large and very grand departmental store in the centre of Oxford at the intersection of Cornmarket Street, Broad Street and George Street that was Ellison & Cavell. It can therefore safely be assumed that draper John Cavell may have been the co-founder of the emporium, which was later taken over by Debenhams.\n\nAt the age of 39 in 1891 and 49 in 1901 Emma Collett was still a spinster, but at that time she was a shopkeeper selling dairy produce in the St Giles district of Oxford. The census return for 1901 described Emma as the aunt of head of the household Joseph F Richardson from Leake in Lincolnshire who was only 20 years of age and a civil engineer. A third person living at the property was Emmas niece Lydia Robinson from Wolvercote who was 31 and also a shopkeeper selling dairy produce, the daughter of Emmas sister Mary Robinson nee Collett (below). However, no record has been found for Emma after that time which might mean that she had married late in her life, or that she had died during the years between 1901 and 1911.\n\n38O8\n\nJulia Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1852 and was 18 years old in 1871 when she was just one of two children still living with her parents in Wolvercote. It was the same ten years later in 1881 when she was still living with her parents at their home in village street in Wolvercote. The census that year indicated that she was 28 and was unmarried with no stated occupation or employment. It can perhaps therefore be assumed that her role in life was to care for her elderly parents James and Sarah Collett who were both approaching their seventieth birthdays.\n\nSometime during the following twenty years her parents James and Sarah passed away and by the time of the census of 1901 Julia Collett was listed as being unmarried at 47, while being a boarder at a house in Wolvercote from where she was working as a paper sorter at the Wolvercote paper-mill. Early in the new century Julia Collett of Wolvercote married John Carey of Launton near Bicester and by April 1911 the couple were living within the Woodstock area where Julia was 57 and John was 54. In 1901 John had been living at Launton and was employed as a platelayer on the railway.\n\n38O9\n\nMary E Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1846. She later married Mr Robinson, probably in Wolvercote, with whom she had a son and a daughter before he died prior to 1881. Both of the children were born at Wolvercote. According to the 1881 Census, Mary E Robinson, a widow of 34, was still in Wolvercote where she was living and working at the vicarage for the unmarried Reverend Henry A Redpath who was 32 and of Forest Hill in Kent. Living at the vicarage with Mary was her son Frederick W Robinson aged 12 who, whilst still at school, was listed in the census record as being a servant at the house, supporting his mother with her domestic and general servant duties.\n\nMarys other child, Lydia Robinson who was nine years old, was living with her grandparents William and Sarah Collett in village street in Wolvercote. From other information within the census of 1881, it is likely that Marys husband was the brother of cattle dealer and farmer of 56 acres William Robinson, aged 29 of Ramsden north of Witney, who was living with his wife Fanny in village street in Wolvercote at that time. By 1901 Marys daughter Lydia was 31 and was still a spinster living and working with her maiden aunt Emma Collett (above) in the St Giles area of the City of Oxford, where they were both described as shopkeepers selling dairy produce.\n\n38O10\n\nJames William Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1848 and was the second child and eldest son of stonemason William Collett and his wife Sarah Ann Langford. In the 1851 census for Wolvercote he was simply listed with his family as J W Collett aged two years. No record of James or any member of his family has been identified in the following census of 1861 and by 1871 James was no longer living in the family home at Wolvercote and may have been living and working in the Aston district of Birmingham where a James Collett from Oxfordshire was 23. Ten years later stonemason James Collett, aged 33 and from Oxfordshire, was single and a lodger at 12 Market Place in Hinckley, the Leicestershire home of cowman John Linney and his family. What happen to him after that time is not yet known.\n\n38O11\n\nEmma Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1850, the third child of William Collett and Sarah Ann Langford. Her birth was recorded at Woodstock (Vol. 6) during the second quarter of the year, and was ten months old on the day of the census in 1851 when, like all of her family, she was recorded just using her initial letter, E Collett. With no census available for the village of Wolvercote in 1861, by 1871 Emma Collett of Wolvercote was working as a domestic servant at a property on Queens Lane, just off the High Street, in the centre of Oxford, at the age of 19. The younger servant at the same address was Emily Collett from Wolvercote, Emmas younger sister who was 13. Eight years after that, it would appear that Emma married John Margetts, a carpenter from Chipping Norton, their wedding recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 24) during the second quarter of 1879.\n\nTwo years after their wedding day, carpenter John Margetts was 30, Emma Margetts was 29 and a washerwoman, when there were two children living at New Yard in Salford, near Chipping Norton in 1881. The older child was three-year-old Thomas Margetts, who may have been the child of a previous marriage, while Emily Margetts was still under one year old. At the end of that decade, the family was again residing in Salford, where two more children had been added to the family. The 1891 census return for Salford recorded the family as John who was 44, Emma who was 40, Thomas who was 14, Emily who was 10, George who was eight and Harry who was five. The Chipping Norton census in 1901, recorded at family as John Margetts aged 56, Emma Margetts aged 49, and their four children as Emily Margetts 20, George Margetts 17, Henry Margetts 15, and William Charles Margetts who was 10 years of age. All of the children had been born in the nearby village of Salford. Emma Margetts died during the next decade, leaving widow John, aged 69 and a carpenter, still living in Chipping Norton with his three sons George, Henry and William Charles.\n\n38O12\n\nDaniel Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1852, the son of William and Sarah Collett, whose birth was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 19) during the third quarter of that year. He was 18 in 1871, by which time he had entered the family business as a stonemason. Two years later, when he was around twenty years old, he met nineteen-year-old Ellen Trinder who was born in Abingdon-on-Thames at the end of 1853, the youngest child of William and Martha Trinder. The marriage of Daniel Collett and Ellen Trinder was conducted at Abingdon on 7th July 1874, and was recorded there (Ref. 2c 271), when Daniels father was confirmed as William Collett and Ellens father was confirmed as William Trinder. Like the vast majority of the Colletts of Wolvercote, the couple lived in a house in village street where all of their children were born. At the time of the census in 1881, the family still living in Wolvercote comprised Daniel Collett was 28 and a stonemason, his wife Ellen Collett from Abingdon was 27, William Collett who was five, Albert Collett who was four, Percy Collett who was three, and Sidney Collett who six months old.\n\nTen years later, more children had been added to the family which, by then, was residing on the High Street in Wolvercote. Stonemason Daniel Collett was 38, Ellen Collett was 37, William J Collett was 15, Albert E Collett was 14, Percy T Collett was 13, Sidney H Collett was 10, Ethel M Collett was seven, Augustus D Collett was five, Helen E Collett was four, and Lilian M Collett was just one year old. The birth of Ethel Mary Collett was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 187) during the first month of 1883, following her birth at Wolvercote just before then of 1882. Curiously, no further record of her has been found after the census in 1891.\n\nAccording to the 1901 Census, most of Daniel and Ellens children were still living in the village of Wolvercote with them, although the three oldest sons had left the family home by then. Still living with mason Daniel Collett, aged 48, and his wife Ellen Collett from Abingdon, who was 47, were Albert Ernest Collett aged 24, Sidney H Collett aged 20, Augustus D Collett aged 15, Helena E Collett aged 14, Lillian M Collett aged 11, Harry T Collett who was nine, Merrick F Collett who was eight, and Rose E Collett who was five.\n\nBy April 1911, the family had moved the very short distance from Wolvercote to Godstow on the banks of the River Thames. Daniel Collett was 58 and still working as a stonemason, together with his unmarried sons who were still living with him, Ellen Collett was 57, Sidney Collett was 30, Augustus Collett was 25, Lillian Collett was 21 and assisting her mother in the family home, Harry Collett was 19, Merrick Collett was 18, and Rose Collett was 15. Only Daniels daughter Helena had left home during the previous decade. Daniel Collett was still living in Wolvercote, at Providence House, when he died on 29th April 1933 at Whitehouse Road in Oxford. Probate for his estate of £1,816 7 Shillings and 1 Penny was granted at Oxford on 7th June 1933 in favour of his two sons Sidney Henry Collett and Augustus Daniel Collett, both of whom were described as stonemasons.\n\n38P24\n\nWilliam John Collett\n\nBorn in 1875 at Wolvercote\n\n38P25\n\nAlbert Ernest Collett\n\nBorn in 1876 at Wolvercote\n\n38P26\n\nPercy Thomas Collett\n\nBorn in 1877 at Wolvercote\n\n38P27\n\nSidney Henry Collett\n\nBorn in 1880 at Wolvercote\n\n38P28\n\nEthel Mary Collett\n\nBorn in 1882 at Wolvercote\n\n38P29\n\nAugustus Daniel Collett\n\nBorn in 1885 at Wolvercote\n\n38P30\n\nHelen Elsie Collett\n\nBorn in 1886 at Wolvercote\n\n38P31\n\nLilian May Collett\n\nBorn in 1889 at Wolvercote\n\n38P32\n\nHarry Trinder Collett\n\nBorn in 1891 at Wolvercote\n\n38P33\n\nMerrick Frederick Collett\n\nBorn in 1892 at Wolvercote\n\n38P34\n\nRose Edna Collett\n\nBorn in 1895 at Wolvercote\n\n38O13\n\nEmily Collett was born in 1857 at Wolvercote, her birth recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 40) during the second quarter of that year, another daughter of William and Sarah Collett. No census records for Wolvercote are available for 1861 and by 1871, Emily Collett from Wolvercote was 13, when she was a general domestic servant working alongside her older sister Emma Collett, at a property in the centre of the City of Oxford. Eight years later, on reaching full age, it is possible that Emily Collett from Wolvercote was married, the event recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 127) during the last quarter of 1879. However, no record of her has been found thereafter.\n\n38O14\n\nHenry Collett was born at Wolvercote near the end of 1857, his birth as the youngest son of William and Sarah Collett was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 12) during the first quarter of 1858. He was 13 years old and still at school in 1871, while living with his family at Wolvercote. Ten years later he was a master carpenter at the age of 23, when he was unmarried and still living at home with his parents at village street in Wolvercote. Nothing further is known about Henry, or though no death record for him has been found.\n\n38O15\n\nRhoda Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1861 and was nine years old in 1871, the last child born to William Collett and Sarah Ann Langford. On leaving school she became a dressmaker, as confirmed in the census of 1881 when Rhoda was 19 and was still living at home with her elderly parents at village street in Wolvercote. Also living there, with her, was her base-born son Horace J Collett, who was one year old. Five years later, Sarah Ann Collett nee Langford died at Wolvercote, leaving Rhoda aged 29, living with her widowed father and her son Horace aged 11, and her older unmarried sister Emma Collett in 1891, by which time they were living on the High Street in Wolvercote. One other member of the family was living there, and was Rhodas nephew Frederick W Robinson, a son of Rhodas eldest married sister Mary (above). Around fourteen months after that census day, Rhoda Collett was married, her wedding recorded at Headington (Ref. 3a 108) during the second quarter of 1892.\n\n38P35\n\nHorace James Collett\n\nBorn in 1880 at Wolvercote\n\n38O16\n\nThomas James Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1848, the eldest child of Matthew Collett of Wolvercote and Ann Collett from Combe, whose birth was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. xvi 25) during the last three months of the year. In the census of 1851, it was only his fathers name that was recorded in full, whereas his mother and himself and his brother were simply included with the initial letter of their first names, when T Collett was two years old. However, in the census of 1871, he was recorded as Thomas J Collett, aged 22 and born at Summertown, when he was still living at the family home in Wolvercote from where he was working as a compositor for a printing company. No record of Thomas James Collett has been found anywhere after that census day.\n\n38O17\n\nJoseph Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1850, with his birth registered at Woodstock (Ref. xvi 158), while it was at Wolvercote that he was baptised on 29th December 1850, the second child of Matthew and Ann Collett. He was three months old in the census of 1851 when he was listed with his family as J Collett. The next census in 1871 confirmed that Joseph Collett, aged 20, was a stonemason who had been born at Wolvercote, when he was still living there with his family. Although he continued to follow in the family tradition of being a stonemason, for some reason he left home in Wolvercote at an early age and moved to the neighbouring county of Buckinghamshire.\n\nTowards the end of the 1870s he met Ellen who was born at Waddesdon, west of Aylesbury, who was eleven years younger than Joseph. The birth of Ellen Marlow was registered at Aylesbury (Ref. 3a 424) during the last three months of 1861, after which she was baptised at Waddesdon on 29th December 1861. That difference in their ages may have been the reason for the split from his own family, and may have even been the reason for the later separation from his wife and only known surviving child. It was also at Waddesdon where Joseph Collett married Ellen Marlow, the daughter of Benjamin Marlow and Alice Saunders, on 14th April 1879 when she was only seventeen years old, with their wedding recorded at Aylesbury (Ref. 3a 743).\n\nThis family would seem to have a difficult back story about which we may never know the full details, with the next census in 1881 being the only time that Joseph and Ellen were recorded under the same roof. By that time they had a daughter whose place of birth was reported to be Bow in London, although no record of her birth has been found anywhere. It is possible that Ellen was already with-child on her wedding day, and the move to London, if in fact that was where Alice was born, may have been the opportunity to secretly present Joseph with the child away from both families.\n\nEither way, by the time of the census conducted on the third of April in 1881, all three of them were living at Wharf Row in the village of Buckland between Aylesbury and Tring.Wharf Row backs onto the Grand Union Canal and is still there today.The census return listed stonemason Joseph Collett as being 30 years old and from Wolvercote in Oxford, Ellen Collett his wife was 19 and from Waddesdon, while their daughter Alice Collett was said to be one year old and from Bow in Middlesex. After a further seven years the birth of their son was registered at Headington in Oxford, maybe an indication that the family had moved there from Buckinghamshire during the intervening years. No obvious births have been found for the couple during those years. However, by 1891, it was only Ellen and her son who were recorded in the census that year, when they were living at Percy Street, off the Iffley Road in Oxford.\n\nEllen Collett from Waddesdon was 29, married, but with no stated occupation, when her relationship to the absent head of the household was wife. Two others were recorded at her Percy Street home, and they were her son Frederick J Collett who was three, and her niece Clarisa M Cripps who was seven and also from Waddesdon, the likely child of one of her married sisters. On that same day in 1891, Joseph Collett from Wolvercote was married and a 40-year-old stonemason who was a lodger at Rutland Street in the Mile End Old Town district of London, Middlesex, the home of joiner Thomas Ansell, his wife and grown up son. It was a similar situation in 1901 when married Joseph from Wolvercote was 50 and continuing to work in London as a stonemason, by which time he was described as a boarder at the Stewarts Road, Battersea home of masonry machinist Arthur Hazel.\n\nOn that occasion his wife Ellen Collett from Waddesdon was residing at Magdalen Road, between Iffley Road and Cowley Road in south Oxford, just a few yards from Percy Street where she had been living ten years earlier. She was 39 and described as a housekeeper who was married, but now the head of the household, confirming the separation from her husband. Still living with her was her Oxford born son Fred Collett who was 13 who had left school, but was not credited with a job of work. Curiously living with them that day, was Alice M Cripps from Waddesdon who was also 13 and unlike Clarisa M Cripps in 1891, Alice was not recorded as a niece, but was a servant and general domestic labourer.\n\nJosephs younger brother John Collett (below) was a journeyman stonemason and in April 1911 the two brothers were staying at the Royal Oak Inn in West Dean on the county boundary between Wiltshire and Hampshire, from where they were most likely working somewhere in the local area. Joseph Collett from Wolvercote was 60 and his brother John Collett from Wolvercote was 50, both of them described as stonemasons working at a stone quarry, and both of them married, when the family home of John Collett was at Summertown in Oxford. Less than three years after that census day, the death of Joseph Collett was recorded at London Lambeth register office (Ref. 1d 440) during the first three months of 1913, at the age of 63.\n\nNo record of Ellen Collett has been found within the census of 1911, who was still living in Oxford when she died, when the death of Ellen Collett aged 91, was recorded at the Oxfordshire register office (Ref. 6c 1315) in 1951.\n\n38P36\n\nAlice Collett\n\nBorn in 1879 at Bow, London\n\n38P37\n\nFrederick J Collett\n\nBorn in 1888 at Oxford\n\n38O18\n\nElizabeth Mary Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1853, her birth recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 27) during the second quarter of the year. She would have been seven years old in the census of 1861, even though no records that year have been found for Wolvercote or the Collett families who lived there. On completing her schooling Elizabeth found work in domestic service within the city of Oxford, where she was recorded as Elizabeth M Collett who was 17 and from Wolvercote, one of four servants with elderly Thomas and Martha Combe. After a further ten years, unmarried Elizabeth M Collett from Oxfordshire was a lodger at the home of the large Bostell family, in Regency Square, Brighton, from where Elizabeth was working as a nurse at the age of 27 in 1881.\n\nAccording to each of the three census returns in 1891, 1901 and 1911 she was confirmed as having been born at Wolvercote, when she was still unmarried and living and working at the Grantchester, Cambridge, home of Francis P Willington from Tamworth in Staffordshire. Elizabeth Mary Collett was his housekeeper who was 37, 47 and 57, on each of those census days. Just over thirty years later Elizabeth Mary Collett was residing at 348 Banbury Road in Oxford when she was taken into the North Oxford Nursing Home where she died on 2nd January 1942. The death of Elizbeth M Collett was recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 128), when she was 88 years of age. Administration of her personal effects amounting to £105 15 Shillings and 1 Penny was granted at Oxford on 23rd March 1942 in favour of John Collett, a retired stonemason, Elizabeths younger brother (below).\n\n38O19\n\nAlfred Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1855, his birth recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 40) during the third quarter of the year and, also immediately after, she was baptised at Wolvercote on 19th August 1855, another son of Matthew Collett of Wolvercote and Ann Collett of Combe. He was 15 in the Wolvercote census of 1871 when he was still living in the village with his family. By the time he was 25 he was a carpenter and a joiner, but was not married and was still living at the family home in Wolvercote. Seven years later, on 30th April 1888, Alfred Collett married Alice Moore by the reading of banns at Worth in Sussex. Alfred was 32 and a carpenter, the son of stonemason Matthew Collett, while Alice was 23 and the daughter of farmer George Moore. Alfreds address was St Michaels and All Angels in Paddington, with Alice of Worth, who was born at Burgh near Louth in Lincolnshire in 1865. One of the witnesses was John Collett, Alfreds younger brother (below). The marriage produced three children for Alfred and Alice and all of them were born at Wolvercote.\n\nHe and his young family were recorded in the Wolvercote census of 1891 when Alfred Collett was 35 and a carpenter and a joiner, his wife Alice Collett was only 25, and their daughter was Dorothy F Collett who was eleven months old. By 1901 Alfred was 45 and Alice was 34, when they were living with their three children at Wolvercote. Alfred was continuing with occupation of a carpenter and a joiner and was working for a local building company, while his three children were Dorothy Collett who was 10, Herbert Collett who was nine, and Wilfred Collett who was two years old.\n\nDuring the next ten years the family moved to nearly New Marston within the Headington district of Oxford, where they were living in 1911. Alfred Collett was 55 and was a carpenter and joiner, his wife Alice Collett was 45, and their three children were confirmed again as Dorothy Collett aged 20, who was a daily governess, Hubert Collett aged 19, who was working with his father as a carpenter and joiner, and Wilfred G Collett who was 12. All members of the household had been born at Wolvercote, except Alice, whose place of birth was said to be Burgh in Lincolnshire. The death of Alfred Collett, aged 81, was recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 37) during the third quarter of 1936.\n\n38P38\n\nDorothy Frances Collett\n\nBorn in 1890 at Wolvercote\n\n38P39\n\nHubert John Collett\n\nBorn in 1892 at Wolvercote\n\n38P40\n\nWilfred George Collett\n\nBorn in 1898 at Wolvercote\n\n38O20\n\nAnnie Sophia Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1858 where she was baptised on 14th March 1858, her birth recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 588) during the first three months of the year. She was one of the children of Matthew Collett of Wolvercote and his wife Ann from Combe whose maiden-name was also Collett. It was as Annie S Collett, aged 13 and still attending school, that she was living at Wolvercote with her family in 1871. After a further ten years, and at the age of 23, she was working as a cook for the Vicar of St Philip & James Church, the Rev. Edward C Denner of Lambeth in Surrey in his home at 24 Leckford Road in the St Giles district of Oxford. By 1891 Annie Collett was 32 and employed as a cook domestic servant at a house on Winchester Road in the St Giles district of the city of Oxford.\n\nIt was during the third quarter of 1892 that the marriage of Annie Sophia Collett and Tom Morris was recorded at Headington (Ref. 3a 88). within the Cowley area of south Oxford that the couple was living in 1901, when cemetery superintendent Tom Morris from Uffingham in Berkshire was 50 and Annie S Morris from Wolvercote was 42. From an earlier marriage, Tom had a son George H Morris who was born at Guildford in Surrey in 1883. He was still living with his father that day, the family completed by Tom M Morris who was not yet one year old, being the son of Tom and Annie. The couples daughter was born at Rose Hill almost a year later, four years after which the death of Annie Sophia Morris was recorded at Headington (Ref. 3a 336) during the first quarter of 1906, when she was only 48 years of age. Widower Tom Morris, with two very young children, then married Edith, as confirmed in the Cowley census of 1911, when Tom Morris was 58, Edith Agnes Morris was 38, Tom Morris Morris was 10, and Edith May Morris was nine years old.\n\n38O21\n\nJohn Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1860 and was baptised there on 9th September 1860, the son of Matthew and Ann Collett. It was earlier in the year, when Johns birth was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 163) during second quarter of 1860. He was 10 years old in the Wolvercote census in 1871 when he was recorded with his family, and according to the new census in 1881 he was 20 and an unemployed stonemason who was still living at village street in Wolvercote with his parents and his two brothers. In order to secure employment, John took up being a journeyman stonemason and in 1891 there was a John Collett at Christchurch in Hampshire who was 30 years old and recorded as a journeyman stonemason. It may have been Johns occupation that took him to Kent during the 1890s, since it was there that he was married in 1897.\n\nThe marriage of John Collett and Ellen Goldup took place in the village of Wye, just a few miles north-east of Ashford in Kent, on 31st July 1897. Both the bride and the groom were 37 years of age, John confirmed as the son of Matthew Collett, and Ellen the daughter of George Goldup. Ellen had been born at Wye, as confirmed in the subsequent census returns, and she presented John with two sons after the couple had initially made their home in Wolvercote. However, following the birth of their second child, the family left Wolvercote when they moved the few miles to Summertown in the St Giles district of north Oxford, where they were living in March 1901. John Collett was 40 and was confirmed as being a journeyman stonemason from Wolvercote, his wife Ellen Collett from Wye in Kent was 41, and their two sons were David J Collett who was two, and Christopher B Collett who was six months old. Their address at that time was 26 Thorncliffe Road in Summertown.\n\nJohns work continued to involve travelling round the country and in April 1911 he was working with his older brother Joseph Collett (above), when the pair of them were recorded as stonemasons working at a stone quarry, while staying at a boarding house at West Dean between Wiltshire and Hampshire. John Collett was 50 and from Wolvercote, while his brother was 60 and also from Wolvercote. Back home in Summertown was his wife Ellen Collett, aged 50, together with their sons David John Collett who was 12, and Christopher Betts Collett who was 10. Once again Ellens place of birth was stated as being Wye in Kent, while the birthplace of her sons was Wolvercote.\n\nBy the time of the death of his unmarried sister Elizabeth Mary Collett (above) at Oxford in early 1942 John Collett was described as a retired stonemason when he was the sole administrator for his sisters personal effects. Four years after losing his sister, the death of John Collett was recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 44) during the second quarter of 1946, when he was 86 years old.\n\n38P41\n\nDavid John Collett\n\nBorn in 1898 at Wolvercote\n\n38P42\n\nChristopher Betts Collett\n\nBorn in 1900 at Wolvercote\n\n38O22\n\nEdwin Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1862 and was baptised there on 12th October 1862, having been born only a short while before the day of his baptism, his birth recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 140). He was eight years old in 1871 and was still living in Wolvercote with his family ten years later. Edwin Collett, aged 18, and his family were residing in a dwelling on village street when, like his older brother John (above), he too was described as an unemployed stonemason in 1881. Towards the end of that decade, Edwin Collett married Sarah Ann Walne, the event recorded at Headington (Ref. 3a 259) during the second quarter of 1889. The marriage produced four children for Edwin and Sarah before the start of the new century.\n\nBy 1891 Edwin and his wife and their first child were living in the Summertown district of Oxford, when Edwin Collett was 28 and a stonemason, Sarah A Collett was 35, and William G E Collett was one year old. Sarah was with-child on the day of the census that year, and gave birth to the couples second son just a few months after. The family was completed during the next five years following the births or their last two children, all four of them born in Oxford. The family was residing within the Cowley St John district of Oxford in 1901, when the census return listed them as Edwin aged 38 and a stonemason from Wolvercote, and his wife Sarah, who was 45 and from Blackwall in Kent. Their four children were William who was eleven, Francis who was nine, Sidney who was eight, and Florence who was three.\n\nTen years later, the family was living at New Marston, still within the Cowley area, where stonemason Edwin Collett was 49, Sarah Ann Collett was 55, William George Edward Collett was 21, Francis Arthur Collett was 19, Sidney Thomas Collett was 18, and Florence May Collett was 14 years old. Also staying with the family at that time was Edwins 17-year-old nephew from Berkshire, Alfred George Clinhard, a railway porter with the Great Western Railway. Midway through the First World War it is established that Edwin and Sarah were living at 50 Argyle Street off the Iffley Road in Cowley. It was while living here that they received the tragic news that their son Sidney had been killed in action during the Battle of the Somme. It was during the second quarter of 1940, that the death of Edwin Collett was recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 27), when he was 77 years old,\n\n38P43\n\nWilliam George Edwin Collett\n\nBorn in 1889 at Oxford\n\n38P44\n\nFrancis Arthur Collett\n\nBorn in 1891 at Oxford\n\n38P45\n\nSidney Thomas Collett\n\nBorn in 1893 at Oxford\n\n38P46\n\nFlorence May Collett\n\nBorn in 1896 at Oxford\n\n38O23\n\nBenjamin Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1866 and was the youngest child born to Matthew Collett and his wife Ann. For some peculiar reason Edwin was not recorded with his family in 1871 when he was living in the same area at the age of four. He was still attending the village school in Wolvercote in 1881 when he was 14 and when he and his family were recorded at village street in Wolvercote. However, having left school shortly after that census day, he eventually left Oxfordshire and was living and working in Leicester by the time he was 24, when the census in 1891 confirmed he was from Wolvercote. On that day, Benjamin was an elementary teacher at a Leicester school, who was a boarder at the boarding house on Berners Street run by William and Selina Gotheridge. Ten year after that, in March 1901, he was living and working at a school in Caverswall, near Stoke-on-Trent, where his occupation was that of a school master.\n\nBetween three and six months later, the marriage of Benjamin Collett and Nellie Marguerite Carter was recorded at West Bromwich register office (Ref. 6b 266) during the third quarter of 1901. Three of their four children were born in Derbyshire, within the area known as Derby Hills, which lies to the south of the town of Derby. However, by the time the next census was conducted in 1911, the family had settled at Calne in Wiltshire, where Nellie was anticipating the birth of her fourth and last child. According to that census, Benjamin Collett from Wolvercote was 44 and the Head Teacher with the Wiltshire County Council Education Authority. His wife Nellie Marguerite Collett was 34 and from the Kings Heath area of Birmingham, and their three children were Eric John Cyril Collett who was eight, Mary Elizabeth Collett who was four, and Robert Charles Collett who was three years old.\n\nThere is one unanswered puzzle surrounding the family, in that, while the 1911 stated the first three children were born in Derbyshire, all of their births were recorded at Calne register office. One logical suggestion could be that Benjamin was offered the position at the Calne school soon after being married, but before the birth of the couples first child. In that way, the birth would have been recorded by Benjamin at Calne, his family later joining him there, after the birth of son Robert. Other than that, the question might be, was the 1911 Census incorrect in recording they were born in Derby Hills.\n\nFor completeness, the registration details for the births of Eric, Mary and Thomas, are as follows: Eric John C Collett during the fourth quarter of 1902 (Ref. 5a 135); Mary Elizabeth Collett during the first three months of 1907 (Ref. 5a 345); and Thomas G Collett, with weeks of the day of the census in 1911, during the second quarter of that year (Ref. 5a 125).\n\n38P47\n\nEric John Cyril Collett\n\nBorn in 1902 at Derby Hills, nr Derby\n\n38P48\n\nMary Elizabeth Collett\n\nBorn in 1906 at Derby Hills, nr Derby\n\n38P49\n\nRobert Charles Collett\n\nBorn in 1908 at Derby Hills, nr Derby\n\n38P50\n\nThomas George Collett\n\nBorn in 1911 at Calne, Wiltshire\n\n38O24\n\nFrederick Robert Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1849, where he was baptised in July that year, the first-born child of mason Charles Collett and Ann Bell. In the Wolvercote census of 1851, Fk Collett was one year of age when living there with his parents and his younger baby brother Charles (below). It is a great shame that no details are available for the Wolvercote census in 1861, which would have confirmed Frederick was eleven years old and hopefully still living with his family. What is known, is that it was during the third quarter of 1870 when the marriage of Frederick Robert Collett and Elizabeth Ann Chamberlain was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 63). Around seven months later, the couple was recorded residing at village street in the Wolvercote census of 1871. Frederick Robt Collett was 21 and a stonemason, Elizabeth Collett was 19 and their son Frederick C Collett was just five months old. All three of them had been born at Wolvercote, as were all of the couples subsequent children. Living in the dwelling next door to the family that year, was Fredricks father Charles Collett (Ref. 38N7) with his second wife Elizabeth Simms, and in the dwelling next door to them was Fredericks cousin, watch and clock maker, James Collett (38O4), who had only just married his much younger wife Elizabeth.\n\nTen years later, in the Wolvercote census of 1881, the extended family of stonemason Frederick R Collett, aged 31, was listed as Elizabeth A Collett who was 29, Fredrick C Collett who was ten, Walter Collett who was six, Philip Collett who was two, and an unnamed Collett baby who was just one month old, who was given the name Arthur. Even though she was the mother of five children, Elizabeth earned income for the family by working as a rag sorter for the nearby paper-mill, the major employer in the area. It seems very likely that she carried out her duties at home, enabling her to care for her young family at the same time.\n\nBy 1891 the even large family had possible left village street for a larger home on the High Street. On that census day, the family comprised Frederick R Collett was 41 and continuing his work as a stonemason, his wife Elizabeth A Collett was 39, and six of their nine children, who were Frederick C Collett who was 20, Walter Collett who was 17, Philip Collett who was 12, Arthur Collett who was 10, Ralph Collett who was six, and Ernest E Collett who was three years old.\n\nFrederick R Collett was 51 in the March census of 1901 when, just for a change, he said he was a mason. His wife Elizabeth Ann Collett was 49, when both of them were still living at Wolvercote with the seven youngest members of their family. Walter Collett was 27, Philip Collett was 22, Arthur Collett was 20, George Collett was 17, Ralph Collett was 16, Ernest Collett was 13, and Leah Collett was six years of age. Just six years later, the death of Frederick Robert Collett was recorded at Woodstock register office (Ref. 3a 141) during the second quarter of 1907, when he was 57 years old. The Will of Frederick Robert Collett was proved at Oxford on 2nd July 1907, when the sole beneficiary was his widow. The probate office documentation also gave that date that he died as 22nd May 1907. After nearly four years as a widow, Elizabeth Ann Collett was living in the neighbouring hamlet of Godstow in 1911, with three of her children. Elizabeth from Wolvercote was 59, Ralph Collett was 26, Ernest Edward Collett was 23, and her daughter Leah Collett was 16.\n\n38P51\n\nFrederick Charles Collett\n\nBorn in 1870 at Wolvercote\n\n38P52\n\nWalter George Collett\n\nBorn in 1873 at Wolvercote\n\n38P53\n\nPhilip Collett\n\nBorn in 1878 at Wolvercote\n\n38P54\n\nArthur Collett\n\nBorn in 1881 at Wolvercote\n\n38P55\n\nGeorge Mitchell Collett\n\nBorn in 1883 at Wolvercote\n\n38P56\n\nRalph Collett\n\nBorn in 1885 at Wolvercote\n\n38P57\n\nErnest Edward Collett\n\nBorn in 1887 at Wolvercote\n\n38P58\n\nLeah Collett\n\nBorn in 1894 at Wolvercote\n\n38O25\n\nCHARLES THOMAS COLLETT was born at Wolvercote in 1851, with his birth recorded at Woodstock (Ref. xvi 3) during the second quarter of the year. Not long after, he was baptised at Wolvercote on 20th April 1851, the eldest of the two sons of Charles and Ann Collett. Two years after his youngest sibling was born, his mother died, and his father was married for a second time. That new relationship was confirmed by the Wolvercote census in 1871, when unmarried Charles Collett was 20 and a mason who was living with his father and his new wife Elizabeth, his brother Walter and his youngest sister Eliza. Also living with them was Charles stepmothers son, from her previous marriage, John Simms from Camden Town.\n\nJust under five years later, the marriage of Charles Thomas Collett and Eliza Cross was recorded at Oxford (Ref. 3a 189) during the first three months of 1876. Eliza was born at Marcham, to the west of Abingdon-on-Thames, on 1st September 1856. Once married, the young couple temporarily settled in Wolvercote, where their first child was born but, within a couple of years, had moved into the City of Oxford. And it was there that they were living at 1 Clarendon Buildings on Walton Crescent in the Jericho area of the city within the Parish of St Thomas, where their next two children were born.\n\nThat situation was confirmed by the census in 1881, in which stonemason Charles T Collett from Wolvercote was 30, Eliza Collett was 25 and from Marcham in Berkshire, and their three children were Thomas W Collett who was six, Francis C Collett who was four, and Clarice L A Collett who was just nine months old. By that day, two of their un-named children had already died. Also living with the family in 1881, was lodger and medical nurse, 61-year-old Eliza Wood of Oxford. Further children were added to the family during the following ten years and, on the day the census was conducted in 1891, the family was still living at 1 Clarendon Buildings on Walton Crescent in the Jericho area of Oxford. Charles Collett from Wolvercote was 40 and a mason, his wife Eliza from Marcham was 36, and their children were named as Thomas Collett from Wolvercote who was 16 and a domestic house porter, Francis Collett who was 14 with no stated occupation, Charles Collett who was six years old and attending school, as was Bertha Collett who was four. Three further children had died by then, including son Francis and daughter Clarice. Lodging with the family was Jane Boyd, a widow of 73, from Hinton in Berkshire.\n\nBy the end of the century just one more child had been added to the family, which had moved across the city from Jericho in the west to the parish of St Barnabas, to the east of the city centre. According to the census in March 1901 the Collett family was residing at 35 Union Street, which runs between Cowley Road and Morrell Avenue. Charles Collett from Wolvercote was 50 and employed as a stonemason, his wife Eliza from Marcham was 46, and it was just their three youngest children who were still living with them. They were Charles Collett who was 16 and an apprentice print compositor, Bertha Collett who was 14 and working as a domestic housemaid, and Agnes Collett who was five. Still living with the family was boarder Jane Boyd from Hinton, a widow at 83. Hinton was very likely Hinton Waldrist, which lies a few miles west of Marcham, so Jane may have been related in some way to Eliza Collett nee Cross.\n\nCharles and Eliza were still living in the 5-roomed dwelling that was 35 Union Street in the St Barnabas area of Oxford in April 1911 and still living there with them were just two of their children. Charles Thomas Collett from Wolvercote was 60 and a mason working in the building trade. His wife of thirty-eight years, Eliza Collett from Marcham, was 56 and during their years together Eliza had given birth to nine children, only four of whom were still alive. The two children still living with the couple were Charles Collett who was 26, unmarried and a compositor working at Oxford University Press, and Agnes M L Collett who was 15 and working as a dressmaker at a business in the local area. Curiously under Birthplace, both of the children were said to have been born at 35 Union Street, when clearly Thomas had been born at 1 Clarendon Building in Jericho.\n\nAt that same time in April 1911, Charles eldest son Thomas was a married man with a family of his own, who was also living in the Cowley area of Oxford, just a few streets away from his parents. Although only six of their recorded nine children are named below, the four who were still living in 1911 were Thomas, Charles, Bertha and Agnes. Daughter Bertha, absent from the family home in 1911 was, at that time in her life, employed by an elderly lady to the north of the city centre. The three un-named children in the list below could, it would appear, have been born around 1878, 1882 and 1888 or shortly thereafter. After a further twenty years, the death of Charles T Collett was recorded at Headington register office (Ref. 3a 109) during the third quarter of 1931, when he was 80 years of age. Two years after being made a widow, the death of Eliza Collett was recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 104) during the third quarter of 1933, at the age of 77.\n\n38P59\n\nTHOMAS WALTER COLLETT\n\nBorn in 1876 at Wolvercote\n\n38P60\n\nFrancis Charles Collett\n\nBorn in 1877 at Oxford\n\n38P61\n\na Collett child  infant death\n\nBorn in 1878 at Oxford\n\n38P62\n\nClarice Lena A Collett\n\nBorn in 1880 at Oxford\n\n38P63\n\na Collett child  infant death\n\nBorn in 1882 at Oxford\n\n38P64\n\nCharles Collett\n\nBorn in 1884 at Oxford\n\n38P65\n\nBertha Mary Collett\n\nBorn in 1886 at Oxford\n\n38P66\n\na Collett child  infant death\n\nBorn in 1890 at Oxford\n\n38P67\n\nAgnes Margaret L Collett\n\nBorn in 1895 at Oxford\n\n38O26\n\nClara Ann Collett was born at Wolvercote near the end of 1852, the only daughter of Charles Collett and his first wife Ann Bell, her birth recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 10) during the first month of 1853. She was then baptised at Wolvercote in January 1853 but tragically, two years after her youngest sister Eliza (below) was born, her mother died. Sometime after that sad event, her father re-married. By 1871 Clara had left the new family home, and had moved into Oxford, where she was working as a domestic servant at 73 Banbury Road, the St Giles home of elderly couple Thomas and Mary Cousins, when she was 18 years old and the younger of two servants at the house.\n\nJust under seven years later, the marriage of Clara Ann Collett and Alfred Eugene Goodall was recorded at Oxford (Ref. 3a 337) during the first quarter of 1878, when her father was confirmed as Charles Collett, a stonemason. One of the witnesses was Claras sister Emily Collett (below). Two years later the pair was residing at Clarendon Street within the Oxford parish of St Thomas, where Alfred E Goodall was 26 and a tailor from Oxford, and Clara Ann Goodall from Wolvercote was 28. By that time, Clara had given birth to two children, Eugene Charles Goodall who was two, and Georgina E Goodall who was only a few months old.\n\nFour more children were added to the family during the 1880s although, by the time of the census in 1891, the couples eldest son was not listed with the family. On that day, the family was living on Hayfield Road, just north of the Jericho area of Oxford, where tailor Alfred was 36, Clara was 38, Georgina was ten, Frederick was seven, Florence was four, Elsie was two, and Lilian had only just been born. Only the five youngest children were still living with their parents in Oxford by 1901, when Alfred Goodall was still working as a tailor aged 47, Clara Goodall was 48, Frederick Goodall was 17 and a tailors apprentice working alongside his father, Florence Goodall was 14, Elsie Goodall was 12, Lilian Goodall was 10, and Nellie Goodall was two years old.\n\nThe family was still living in that same area of Oxford in 1911, by which time only the two youngest daughters were again recorded with Alfred, aged 56 and born at Great Clarendon, and Clara, aged 58 from Wolvercote. Elsie was 22 and Nellie was 20, both of them said to have been born at Hayfield Road. Rather curiously, Alfred was described being a tailor waisteral hand, while Elsie was working as a domestic general servant, with Nellie still attending. Twenty-seven years after that census day, the death of Alfred E Goodall was recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 4) during the second quarter of 1938, when he was 83 three years old. When his Will was proved at Oxford on 21st May 1938, it was perhaps surprising that his widow was not named as the main beneficiary. Instead, that was Frederick Ernest Goodall, his only surviving son, together with John Fathers.\n\nJohn Fathers (Jack) was the husband of daughter Florence Clara E Goodall, whose marriage was recorded at Oxfords Headington register office (Ref. 3a 157) during the first quarter of 1909. After their first child, Eric Fathers, was born in Oxford, the family moved to Wolvercote, where the three of them were recorded in 1911. Jack Fathers from Summertown was 24 and a grocers assistant, Florence Fathers was also 24, and son Eric was one year old. Three more children were added to the family over the following years, Reginald S J Fathers in 1912, Robert A Fathers in 1915, and Florence D Fathers in 1923, all of the births recorded at Headington when the mothers maiden-name was confirmed as Goodall. Alfreds widow survived him by just over five years when, the death Clara A Goodall was recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 105) during the third quarter of 1943, at the age of 90.\n\nAfter Alfred Goodall passed away in 1938, Clara Ann eventually moved to East Oxford to live with her married son Frederick Ernest Goodall and his wife Alice White. Having spent the last five years of her life as a widow, Clara was 90 years old when she died in Oxford, where her death was recorded there (Ref. 3a 105) during the third quarter of 1943. Fredericks wife Alice also died four years later at the same address, when she was 67. Frederick and Alice Goodall were the grandparents of Marian E Cambanakis, nee Goodall, who was born at Oxford in 1949, where her mothers maiden-name was Korassidou, and it was at Oxford in 1980 that Marian E Goodall married Demostheris-Andreas Cambanakis. A big thank goes to Marian for being the catalyst for the update of this file in 2021, having generously provided a tremendous number of new details about members of this branch of the Collett family.\n\nIt is fascinating that a party celebration of the Goodall family of Wolvercote brought together two branches of the Collett of Oxfordshire. The owner of the photograph, the aforementioned Marian Cambanakis, relates that the picture includes her great great grandmother Clara Ann Goodall, nee Collett (Ref. 38O26), with her husband Alfred Eugene Goodall, next is Frederick Jesse Collett (Ref. 37O17) with his wife Edith May Collett, nee White. On the other side of Clara and Alfred are Edith Colletts sister Alice Goodall, nee White, and her husband Frederick Goodall, who are Marians grandparents.\n\n38O27\n\nWalter Collett was born at Wolvercote near the end 1854, the son of Charles Collett, a mason, by his first wife Ann Bell. He was baptised at Wolvercote in December 1854, with his birth later recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 29) during the first three months of 1855. He was eight years old when his mother died, after which his father re-married. Upon leaving school, he initially became a carpenter and a joiner, which was how he was described in the Wolvercote census of 1871, when he was 16 and was living with his father and his stepmother. It was eight years later during the first three months of 1879 that he married Elizabeth Ann Hearn at Brackley (Ref. 3b 349) in Northamptonshire, close to Finmere, where she was born in 1852. Eight years earlier, dressmaker Elizabeth Hearn of Finmere was 18, when she was living at Brackley with her widowed father Luke, a butcher, and her younger brother Frederick Hearn. Just over a year after they were married, Elizabeth gave birth to a son when the couple was living in Oxford.\n\nThe family of three was recorded in the Oxford census of 1881 as living at 43 Nelson Street in the St Thomas district of the city, where Walter was 26 and a carpenter from Wolvercote and his wife Elizabeth was 28 and from Brackley. Their son Albert Collett was just ten months old having been born in Oxford during the summer of the previous year, and may have been born at 43 Nelson Street. It is established the at least one other child was added to their family, although there may have been others who did not survive.\n\nBy 1891 Walter Collett was 36 and a carpenter living at Hayfield Road, the same address as his older married sister Clara Ann Goodall (above). His wife Elizabeth was 38, and their two children were Albert H Collett who was 10, and Emily M Collett who was six years old. At that time in their lives the family was recorded in the Jericho area of Oxford, close to the Church of St Philip & St James. Staying with the family, was Elizabeths father, Luke Thomas Hearn, who was 65. No more children appear to have been born into the family which, by the time of the census in March 1901, was residing within the St Giles district of Oxford. Walter from Wolvercote was still working as a carpenter at the age of 46, his Elizabeth from Brackley was 48, and their two children Albert aged 20, and Emily who was 16, were still living with them. Walters son was very likely working with him, as he too was a carpenter.\n\nSometime during the first decade of the new century, their son Albert left the family home, perhaps to go abroad, since no record of him has been found anywhere in Great Britain in 1911. Instead, at that same time, the remaining members of the family had moved to New Marston in north Oxford, where Walter Collett was 56 and continuing his occupation of a carpenter, Elizabeth Collett was 58 and had been born at Finmere near Brackley, and their daughter Emily Maud Collett was 26 and a dressmaker. It was just over twenty-one years later that the death of Walter Collett was recorded at Headington register office (Ref. 3a 99) during the third quarter of 1932, when he was 77. By that time in his life, he had already been a widower for the previous five years, following the death of Elizabeth Ann Collett on 31st March 1927, at the age of 75. Her Will was proved at Oxford on 24th May 1927, the main beneficiary being Walter Collett.\n\n38P68\n\nAlbert Hearn Collett\n\nBorn in 1880 at Oxford\n\n38P69\n\nEmily Maud Collett\n\nBorn in 1884 at Oxford\n\n38O28\n\nEmily Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1857 and her birth was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 40) during the second quarter of the year, following which, she was baptised at Wolvercote in June 1857. Emily was the penultimate child of Charles Collett and Ann Bell and when she was almost twenty-one years old, Emily was one of the witnesses at the marriage of her older sister Clara Ann Collett and Alfred Eugene Goodall early in 1878, when her father was confirmed as Charles Collett, a stonemason. It was during the following, when Emily gave birth to a son when she was not married, the child raised by his grandfather Charles Collett at Wolvercote, where he was one-year-old in 1881 and eleven years of age in 1891. Emily was in domestic service on the day of the national census was conducted in 1871 and again in 1881.\n\nIt is thanks to contributions from Marian Cambanakis, nee Goodall, in 2020, that Emily has been confirmed as the mother of son Alfred, and that she married Edwin Judd in 1888, when Alfred continued to be looked after by Emilys father Charles Collett and his second wife. We also now know that Edwin Judd died in 1897, after which Emily continued to work in domestic service as a cook and a housekeeper in order to survive. At the time of her passing in 1939, Emily was recorded as residing at Godstow Road in Wolvercote, most likely following many years living there at the home of her son and his wife. When probate was resolved, the personal effects of Emily Judd were bequeathed to Alfred Collett, a joiner. It is also interesting to note that, on the later death of Alfred Collett, he was living at the address where his mother was when she passed away.\n\n38P70\n\nAlfred Collett\n\nBorn in 1879 at Wolvercote\n\n38O29\n\nEliza Collett was born at Wolvercote around 1860 and was the last child of mason Charles Collett and his first wife Ann Bell, whose birth was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 25) during the second quarter of the year. It was during the month of July 1861 that she was baptised at Wolvercote. Eliza Collett was nine years old in the census of 1871 when she was living in Wolvercote with her widowed father and two older brothers Charles and Walter Collett, and John Simms the son of her fathers second wife. On leaving school she entered into domestic service and, by 1881, when she was 21, Eliza was working as a live-in servant and housemaid at the home of 80-year-old widower and clergyman Richard Greswell at 39 St Giles Street in Oxford, where she was one of six servants. In 1911 Bertha Mary Collett (Ref. 38P65) was a parlour for Helen Margaret Greswell at 70 Woodstock Road in Oxford, not far from St Giles Street. Bertha was Elizas cousin, their fathers being brothers.\n\nIt was six years after the census in 1881, that the marriage of Eliza Collett and Josiah Charles Watson was recorded at Woodstock (Ref. 3a 216) during the second quarter of 1887. Josiah was a civil servant employed as a rural post messenger and the son of James and Susanna Watson of Islip Hill in the Oxfordshire village of Noke, where he was born during the summer of 1857. Shortly after they were married the pair left Oxfordshire, when they moved to London, where their son was born and where they were living in 1891, 1901 and 1911. Josiah Charles Watson had switched from being a postman, to being a tram conductor, as confirmed in 1891 when he was 33 and living at Olinda Road in Hackney. Eliza Watson from Wolvercote was 29, and Frederick Josiah Watson was two years of age, whose birth was recorded at Hackney. Eight years later the death of their 10-year-old son was also recorded at Hackney, where Josiah and Eliza were still living in 1901.\n\nAccording to the census that year, Josiah C Watson from Islip was 43 and still employed as a tram conductor, while his wife Eliza from Wolvercote was 39. Ten years after that, the couple was recorded in the Stoke Newington area of Hackney, with exactly the same details when they were 53 and 49 respectively, the only addition information being tram conductor Josiah was working for the London County Council. Twenty-six years later, when Eliza was 76, she passed away. However, at some time during those years, maybe with the outbreak of war in 1914, the couple returned to Oxford, where the death of Eliza Watson was recorded (Ref. 3a 110) during the second quarter of 1937. Just less than seven years after being widowed, the death of Josiah C Watson was also recorded at Oxford register office (Ref. 3a 86) during the first three months of 1944, when he was 86 years old. The Will of Josiah Charles Watson was proved at Oxford on 25th September 1944, when the only beneficiary was his sister Ada Edith Faulkner. The legal documents also confirmed that he had passed away six months earlier, on 16th March 1944.\n\n38P1\n\nWilliam James Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1856, the eldest child of William Collett and Mary Ann Jones. William was another member of the family to take up the occupation of stonemason and lived on village street in Wolvercote like many of his relatives. It was around 1880 that he married Ann Marie Corke who had been born as Ann Marie Collett at Bampton, south of Witney, towards the end of 1856 or early in 1857. Ann Maria Collett (Ref. 47O8) was one of the four base-born children of unmarried mother Esther Elizabeth Collett of Bampton, the later wife of Alfred Corke. Further details of Anns family can be found in Part 47  The Fyfield & Eastleach Martin Line.\n\nAccording to the census in 1881 William J Collett, aged 24 and from Wolvercote, was a stonemason residing in a dwelling on village street in Wolvercote with his wife Annie M Collett. She was also 24 and was described as a former domestic servant who had been born at Bampton in Oxfordshire. On the day of the census that year Annies youngest half-sister Edith M Corke, who was nine years old and also of Bampton, was described as a visitor in the Collett household. It was the stating of Anns recent occupation, and the fact that they had no children, which suggests that she and William were only very recently married. However, it was later that same year that Ann presented William with their first child.\n\nOver the next decade the marriage produced a total of three children. So, by the spring of 1891 the family comprised William J Collett and Annie M Collett, both 34 years of age, and their children Alfred T Collett, who was nine and born at Wolvercote, William H Collett, who was five and born at Sunnymead, and Percy V Collett who was two years old and also born at Wolvercote. Sunnymead is situated very close to Wolvercote and lies just north of the Summertown district of Oxford. Also staying as boarders with the family that day in 1891 at their home in Meadow View were (a) Alma L Corke from Bampton who was 25 and the younger half-sister of Ann Marie, (b) Vincent Collett aged 25 from Wolvercote, Williams younger brother (below) and (c) Henry Jones, the brother of Williams mother, who was an army pensioner who was still living with the Collett family ten years later and with whom a reduced Collett family was still living ten years after that.\n\nDuring the middle of the 1890s the family left Wolvercote and moved away from Oxford to settle in Bampton, where Ann had been born some forty years earlier. Also, during that decade two further children were added to family, the first was born before the move to Bampton, with the second born after the family had settled there.\n\nBy the turn of the century Williams and Anns eldest son Alfred had already left the family home and was a soldier based in London. In addition to that, head of the house William was also missing from the Bampton based family according to the census return for 1901. The family on that occasion, residing at Church View in Bampton, comprised Annie Collett who was 44, her sons William aged 15 of Sunnymead and Percy aged 12 of Wolvercote, and her daughters Marion, who was eight and also of Wolvercote, and Florence who was two and born at Bampton. For the past ten years the family had living with them, both at Wolvercote and Bampton, Henry Jones who was described as a widower and an uncle, being the brother of Williams mother.\n\nIn 1911 it was the reverse situation, insofar that it was Ann who was missing from the family still living in Bampton, while her husband William had returned and was listed in the census that year. That was because the death of Ann Marie Collett nee Corke, formerly Ann Marie Collett, was recorded at Witney register office (Ref. 3a 729) during the first quarter of 1909 when she was 51. Her eldest son Alfred was married by then and was living nearby in Bampton, while living with 54 years old widower William Collett in 1911 at Church Street in Bampton were his two daughters Marion who was 17 and Florence who was 13. On that occasion the head of the household was Henry Jones from Wolvercote who was 67, with the three members of the Collett family described as boarders.\n\nIt is assumed that family group remained together until Henry Jones passed away four years later, his death recorded at Witney (3a 1361) during the second quarter of 1915. It was six years later that the death of William J Collett was recorded at Witney register office (Ref. 3a 1232) during the first three months of 1921 when he was 64.\n\n38Q1\n\nAlfred Thomas Collett\n\nBorn in 1881 at Wolvercote\n\n38Q2\n\nWilliam Henry James Collett\n\nBorn in 1885 at Sunnymead\n\n38Q3\n\nPercy Victor Collett\n\nBorn in 1888 at Wolvercote\n\n38Q4\n\nMarion Collett\n\nBorn in 1893 at Wolvercote\n\n38Q5\n\nFlorence Collett\n\nBorn in 1897 at Bampton, Oxon\n\n38P2\n\nEllen Collett was born at Wolvercote in 1858, the eldest daughter of William Collett and Mary Ann Jones. Like so many young girls at that time, Ellen entered into domestic service upon leaving school.\n\nAt the age of twenty-two in 1881 she was not married and was working as a live-in servant and cook for forty-five years old annuitant Anne Petch in her home at 6 Wellington Square in the St Giles district of the City of Oxford.\n\nIt was towards the end of the following year that Ellen married George Giles, a rural messenger, carrier and postman in Wolvercote.\n\nThe marriage produced ten children for the couple, the most notable being their first child, Alice Agnes Giles who was born in Headington.\n\nThe couples next two children where Henry Giles and George Giles who were both born while the family was living within the St Clements area of Oxford, after which the family moved to Beckley where their family was completed with a further seven children.\n\nOnce their children had grown up and left their Beckley home, Ellen and George went to live at St Marys Road in Oxford, the same road where Ellens niece Blanche Collett was living and working in 1891. It was while at their St Marys Road home that Ellen and George provided a meeting ground for their large extended family and where Ellen always served fresh doughnuts to her grandchildren seated around a table covered with a snowy white cloth.\n\nThe family built a theatre in the basement of the house, complete with seating, stage curtains and lighting, for which the children devised endless performances. Ellen found them hugely entertaining and would laugh soundlessly, her body trembling and with tears rolling down her cheeks.\n\nSuch was Ellens prominence within the family that it is completely understandable she was seen by all as the real matriarch of the Collett family. And so, to return to her most notable child, that being Alice Agnes G"
