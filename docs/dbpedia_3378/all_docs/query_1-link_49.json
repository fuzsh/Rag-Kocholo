        "text": "Oncotarget (a primarily oncology-focused, peer-reviewed, open access journal) aims to maximize research impact through insightful peer-review; eliminate borders between specialties by linking different fields of oncology, cancer research and biomedical sciences; and foster application of basic and clinical science.\n\nIts scope is unique. The term \"oncotarget\" encompasses all molecules, pathways, cellular functions, cell types, and even tissues that can be viewed as targets relevant to cancer as well as other diseases. The term was introduced in the inaugural Editorial, Introducing Oncotarget.\n\nAs of January 1, 2022, Oncotarget has shifted to a continuous publishing model. Papers will now be published continuously within yearly volumes in their final and complete form and then quickly released to Pubmed.\n\nOn August 25, 2022, the Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a new government policy legislating the immediate public release of all United States-funded research publications by 2025. Learn more here and here.\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the Council of the European Union adopted conclusions on high-quality, transparent, open, trustworthy, and equitable scholarly publishing. The Council calls for immediate and unrestricted open access to publishing research involving public funds. Learn more."
