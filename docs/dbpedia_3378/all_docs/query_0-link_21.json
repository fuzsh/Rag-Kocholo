        "text": "#FCA #ESG #sustainability #greenwashing FCA is consulting on new guidance („Anti-Greenwashing“) on their expectations for FCA-authorised firms making claims about the sustainability of a product or service. Consumers are increasingly demanding more sustainable products and services. As a result, there has been a growing number of products and services which claim to meet that demand. As this demand continues to grow, so does the risk of ‘greenwashing’ as there are concerns that some of these claims may be exaggerated and misleading. All sustainability-related claims made by FCA-authorised firms about their products and services must be fair, clear and not misleading, as FCA ´ s anti-greenwashing rule sets out. This proposed guidance is designed to help firms better understand our expectations under the anti-greenwashing rule and other existing, associated requirements. Very interesting statements, looking forward to your comments. Best regards Hartmut Renz https://lnkd.in/db9nyHsH\n\nThe FCA’s anti-greenwashing rule comes into force on May 31, 2024. This regulation, a pivotal component of the FCA's Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) regime, aims to bolster transparency in sustainable investment products and safeguard consumers from deceptive sustainability claims. Martin Lovick - Director of Capital Markets, provides insights into this regulatory measure, and looks at the applicability of the rule, extending to all FCA-regulated firms, whether or not they consciously provide or promote products or services with a sustainability or ESG theme. The article outlines the guidance from the FCA, offering examples that will fail to meet their expectations in the following areas: substantiating claims, ensuring clear communication, maintaining information completeness, and fairness in comparisons.

Assess if the firm is making any sustainability-related statements in relation to its products, services, or business strategy. 2. Assess if all communications and marketing materials, offering documents and regulatory disclosures are accurate and consistent with the sustainability characteristics of products and services. 3. Review whether there are appropriate governance and oversight controls over the sustainability communications that the firm makes. If you need support to understand the anti-greenwashing rule, the SDR regime more broadly, please get in touch.

This follows notably the ban on green claims by the Advertising Standards Authority against several entities such as BMW, MG, and Transport for London. 𝐅𝐂𝐀’𝐬 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞: 1.

𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐞𝐬: - Fines, operational restrictions, or prohibitions; mandatory withdrawal of misleading communications/documents; increased litigation risk if the FCA’s \"naming and shaming\" policy is implemented; 𝐩𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐢𝐜 𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐦𝐬 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐞𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.

𝐃𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐔𝐊 & 𝐄𝐔 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 - The FCA’s rule applies specifically to FCA-authorized firms, while the EU’s regulations apply to all traders marketing products to EU consumers. -The EU regulations include specific bans on certain types of claims and require the use of approved certification schemes or public authorities for sustainability labels, which is not explicitly mentioned in the FCA’s rule. No Impunity #Greenwashing #Regulations #FCA #EUDirectives #Compliance #Litigation\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has unveiled new sustainability disclosure requirements to improve consumer trust and ensure claims aren’t misleading. Commercial litigation partner Elaina Bailes commented: “How much the rules will affect firms’ approaches to marketing sustainable financial products will play out next year once the rules come into force.” “Though the FCA has published some clear examples of descriptions that may be problematic, the possibility of greenhushing remains, with firms not wanting to fall foul of untested rules and so playing down sustainability credentials out of an abundance of caution.” Read more here: https://lnkd.in/eY7SRq5q #greenwashing"
