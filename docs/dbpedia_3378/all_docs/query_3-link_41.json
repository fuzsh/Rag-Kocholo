        "text": "And neighbours Billericay improved their bid for a top-half finish with a six-wicket success at bottom club Southend.\n\nEssex and England under-19 youngster Jack Plom proved the pick of the Shenfield attack with a stunning haul of 7-12.\n\nThe home side chose to bat first after winning the toss but Plom quickly reduced them to 6-2 and Essex staffer Aaron Beard claimed a third wicket with only 16 runs on the board.\n\nCharlie Haddon got in on the act to make it 32-4, before Adam Soilleux and Max Holmmes put on 53 for the fifth wicket.\n\nPlom ended their stand and struck for his fourth wicket just two balls later, with Arshad Ali leaving Hadleigh 85-7.\n\nThe last three Hadleigh wickets fell to Plom as the hosts were dismissed for 101, with Ali hitting 20 off 21 balls at the top of Shenfield’s innings.\n\nOllie Ekers and Jamie Walton fell cheaply as the visitors slipped to 53-3, but Mitchell Edwards held firm to finish unbeaten on 48 from 43 balls, having hit a six and eight fours.\n\nAlan Jones (30 not out) gave support in an unbroken 51-run stand, hitting six boundaries as Shenfield reached their target in 18 overs and moved out of the bottom two, two points above Hadleigh with three games left.\n\nBillericay saw basement boys Southend make 283-4 from 64 overs at Southchurch Park, led by Charlie Lockhart’s unbeaten 103.\n\nRobert Rayner (2-52) nabbed a brace for the visitors, who slipped to 74-3 in reply as Aaron Curtis hit 46 off 45 balls.\n\nDarren Ironside put on 174 for the fourth wicket with captain Lee Knight, who struck 10 fours on his way to 88 off 129 balls.\n\nAnd Ironside saw Billericay to the finish, making an unbeaten 104 from 144 balls after hitting 13 fours.\n\nVictory leaves Billericay in fifth place, following promotion last year, on 185 points."
