        "text": "Having won their regional group, Essex saw off holders Surrey in the quarter finals with Robbins scoring an impressive 78 to guide his team to victory by 44 runs.\n\nSoilleux then hit a superb 32 not in the semi-finals as Essex beat a strong Warwickshire side.\n\nBoth Hadleigh stars were then in fine form in the final as they beat Northern champions Cheshire.\n\nRobbins caught the eye in the field with a superb run out and a catch to help reduce their opponents to just 79 from 44 overs.\n\nHe then scored a quick 20 off 11 balls to ensure Essex reached the required target in just 21 overs to make sure they lifted the County Cup for the first time in their history.\n\nThis completed an outstanding year for Robbins and Soilleux as they also played a huge part in helping Hadleigh reach the last eight of the National Portman under-15 cup and the semi-finals of the Match-play under-16 cup.\n\nThey have both also played in Hadleigh's senior team this season and will be lining up in the semi-final of the Peters Cup later this week."
