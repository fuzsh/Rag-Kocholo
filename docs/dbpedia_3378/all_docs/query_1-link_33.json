Further, the rising prevalence of treated thyroid cancer in women of child-bearing age means that survivors of thyroid cancer are frequently presenting for obstetric care, occasionally in the setting of persisting structural disease. To ensure that optimal health outcomes are achieved for mother and child, it is essential that pre-pregnancy issues are comprehensively addressed, and that management decisions during pregnancy remain both patient and child focused, best achieved through a woman-centered multidisciplinary team. As new data emerge regarding the impact of radioactive iodine on fertility, careful balancing of risk and benefits of this treatment is required.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThyroid nodules are common in women of childbearing age. Thyroid nodules may be detected due to symptoms of local compression (either due to larger size, or pressure on the trachea or esophagus), but are more commonly detected incidentally on imaging performed for other reasons. As well as determining if compressive symptoms are present, all thyroid nodules must be risk-stratified for the presence of malignancy. A third factor is to determine whether the nodule is functional (i.e., autonomously producing thyroid hormone), however this cannot be reliably assessed during pregnancy as it is dependent on radionucleotide imaging which is contra-indicated during pregnancy.\n\nIn general, the investigation or treatment of any new or co-existent medical conditions in pregnancy should be weighed against the separate risks and benefits to both the mother and fetus. Although most thyroid nodules will not grow during pregnancy, and therefore permit management decisions to be deferred to after birth (thus prioritizing fetal wellbeing), a small proportion of cases will require emergent management within pregnancy to prioritize maternal wellbeing (1).\n\nThyroid carcinomas generally develop from follicular epithelial cells (termed differentiated thyroid cancer, DTC) and present morphologically as papillary (PTC) or follicular (FTC) subtypes. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, highly aggressive de-differentiated variant of DTC. Rarely, parafollicular, neuro-endocrine derived C-cells can give rise to medullary thyroid cancers (MTC). Thyroid lymphoma and metastases from other solid organ cancers are rare. In general, DTC has an greater than 98% 10 year survival in women of child-bearing age (2).\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY OF THYROID NODULES AND THYROID CANCER\n\nThyroid Nodules\n\nThere is a clear female preponderance for the development of thyroid nodules that is demonstrated in studies from varied ethic groups, and in populations that are iodine-replete and iodine deficient (3-5). Thyroid nodules are also more prevalent with increasing age (6){Reiners, 2004 #1161}. This may partly be explained by exposure to female reproductive hormones, as studies have demonstrated associations with increasing thyroid nodularity and multiparity, older age at menopause, and the presence of uterine fibroids (6-9). In a single study, use of oral contraceptive hormones was associated with reduced thyroid volume, but not a change in thyroid nodularity (10).\n\nCarcinoma of the Thyroid Gland\n\nThe increased prevalence of thyroid nodules in females is matched by an increased prevalence of thyroid cancer amongst women. SEER data from the United States cancer registry reports thyroid cancer incidence at 21 cases per 100,000 females, compared to 7.1 per 100,000 males (11). When stratified by age, it is evident that this gender-based divergence is seen as early as puberty (Figure 1). The peak incidence of thyroid cancer amongst females occurs in midlife (age 35-59), and occurs earlier than the peak incidence in males (age 65-75), which corresponds with exposure to female reproductive hormones. ATC and MTC have equal incidence between genders.\n\nAlthough epidemiological data would suggest a strong link between exposure to female reproductive hormones and development of thyroid cancer, firm evidence linking reproductive factors to thyroid cancer risk is less clear. Some studies have shown a small (or transient) increase risk of DTC following pregnancy compared to nulliparous women (12). Age of menarche, menopause, and menstrual cycle patterns present conflicting data (12), however in general, longer exposure to reproductive hormones appears associated with increased thyroid cancer risk (13-15). Conversely, extended periods of breastfeeding (resulting in prolonged reductions in cirulating estradiol), have been associated with with decreased incidence of thyroid cancer (14, 16, 17).\n\nIncidence of Thyroid Carcinoma in Pregnancy\n\nMultiple studies confirm that carcinoma of the thyroid gland is the second most frequent pregnancy-associated cancer, behind carcinoma of the breast. Registry studies suggest that thyroid cancer is present in between 14-27 per 100,000 mothers giving birth (18, 19). In most cases, this represents newly diagnosed thyroid cancer during pregnancy, which is usually organ-confined. However, a combination of increasing diagnosis of thyroid cancer amongst young women and excellent prognosis has resulted in an increasing cohort of survivors of thyroid cancer requiring obstetric care (20). This is demonstrated by data from Taiwan, showing thyroid cancer prevalence amongst women (175 cases per 100,000 women) is 9-fold higher than the incidence (18 cases per 100,000 women) (21). Occasionally, pregnancy occurs in a woman with known or suspected metastatic disease. A recent study from the USA reports that a historical diagnosis of thyroid cancer was the most common cancer present in women presenting for obstetric care (22).\n\nIMPACT OF A PREGNANCY ON NUMBER AND SIZE OF THYROID NODULES\n\nImpact of Pregnancy Hormones on Thyroid Follicular Epithelium\n\nPregnancy represents a stimulatory environment for thyroid follicular cells. The pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein. Although the beta subunit is unique, the alpha subunit is common to follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). As a result, this structural homology causes cross-stimulation of the TSH receptor by HCG, leading to physiological TSH-independent stimulation of the TSH-receptor, predominantly in the first trimester when HCG levels are highest. As well as contributing to gestational hyperthyroidism, in this way HCG mediated TSH-receptor signaling acts to stimulate growth of the thyroid follicular epithelium (23). Sustained activation of the signaling cascade mediated by the TSH-receptor has been associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer in large observational studies. However, it is not known whether more limited periods of increased TSH-receptor signaling, such as would occur during pregnancy, materially contributes to thyroid cancer risk (24).\n\nIodine (not a pregnancy hormone) is a trace element required for normal maternal thyroid function and fetal thyroid development and function. Pregnancy increases maternal demands for iodine and a daily intake of approximately 250-300mcg is recommended (25). Iodine excess and iodine deficiency states are both associated with an increased prevalence of thyroid nodules (3, 26).\n\nChanges in Number and Size of Thyroid Nodules During Pregnancy\n\nAs previously outlined, the hormonal environment of pregnancy is associated with the development of new thyroid nodules, and with potential growth of existing thyroid nodules. Using ultrasound screening, thyroid nodules are demonstrated in 3-21% of pregnant women (26-28), although most nodules are small (<1cm) and not detectable clinically (26). Prospective studies of pregnant women show an increase in thyroid nodule number and size during pregnancy. In a study of 221 women in China using repeated sonographic evaluation, an increase in nodule volume during pregnancy was shown in 15% of women in whom nodules were already present at baseline evaluation. New thyroid nodules were detected in 13% of the cohort. Post-partum, the number of women with thyroid nodules had increased from 15% to 24% (26). All nodules had a benign sonographic appearance. Similarly, a study of 726 pregnant women in Belgium identified a 3% incidence of thyroid nodules at baseline (determined by two-step screening with palpation followed by ultrasound). Of those with nodules, 60% showed an increase in size of at least 50%. Further, 20% (4/20) of women with regular sonographic surveillance developed new nodules during pregnancy (27).\n\nPRESENTATION OF A NEW THYROID NODULE IN THE PREGNANT PATIENT\n\nA thyroid nodule usually comes to attention in pregnancy following the identification of a palpable abnormality. Screening for thyroid nodules in asymptomatic individuals without risk factors, both in the pregnant and non-pregnant population, is not recommended (29).\n\nThyroid nodules should be assessed using a triple assessment, including clinical assessment, sonographic risk stratification, and biopsy (in selected cases). Scintigraphy, which is part of the standard workup for functional nodules in the non-pregnant population, is contra-indicated in pregnancy due to the risk of ionizing radiation to the fetus.\n\nImportant historical factors that increase the chance of a nodule being malignant include the presence of:\n\nA familial cancer syndrome, including multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2), familial PTC, Cowdenâs syndrome, familial adenomatosis polyposis, and Carney Complex.\n\nNeck irradiation in childhood, e.g., treatment for cancers of the head and neck\n\nExposure to ionizing radiation in early life (age <18 years)\n\nOn clinical examination, a palpable lump should be characterized. The presence of a large, very firm or rapidly growing nodule should raise concern for malignancy. Neck lymph nodes should be evaluated. Symptoms and signs of compression of local adjacent structures should be sought.\n\nMany thyroid nodules are functional, however the determination of the functional status of a thyroid nodule in pregnancy is limited. Firstly, although TSH should be checked, a low TSH may reflect gestational hyperthyroidism and should be interpreted with reference to the current gestational age. Most functional nodules progress slowly, therefore a pre-pregnancy TSH level which is at, or below, the lower limit of the reference range may provide a helpful clue. Secondly, radioactive isotopes used for thyroid scintigraphy readily cross the placenta, and the radiation exposure to the fetus does not justify the use of this modality in pregnancy. Therefore, conclusive determination of whether a thyroid nodule is functional (and thus of very low malignant potential), or non-functional, during pregnancy is usually not possible.\n\nSerum biomarkers for thyroid cancer are not currently in routine use. Although serum calcitonin is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of MTC (30), it is not validated for use in pregnancy, especially as calcitonin levels rise over the course of a normal pregnancy. Further, its use in assessment of thyroid nodules in non-pregnant women is not universally established. Carcino-embryonic antigen, also a marker of MTC, can rise during pregnancy, and should be interpreted with caution (31).\n\nNeck ultrasound is the definitive tool for assessment of thyroid nodules, and is safe in pregnancy. A high-frequency linear transducer is optimal to provide detailed characterization of the sonographic features, including size, echogenicity, shape, margins, the presence of calcification, and the presence of abnormal lymph nodes in the central and lateral neck. All nodules should be risk stratified according to a validated scoring system, such as from the American Thyroid Association (32) or the American College of Radiology (33). If fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is required, this can be safely performed in all trimesters of pregnancy, with indications identical to that of the non-pregnant population (32).\n\nNodules with higher risk features, such as larger size, growth in pregnancy, suspicion of extra-thyroidal extension, presence of large-volume nodal metastases, or suspicion for MTC or ATC should be considered for biopsy and surgery during pregnancy. However, for smaller nodules without any high-risk features, consideration should be given to deferring biopsy (and any planned intervention) until the post-partum period, as several studies have confirmed that there is no survival benefit for surgery during pregnancy for low risk DTC (34).\n\nIMPACT OF PREGNANCY ON A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF THYROID CANCER\n\nImpact of Pregnancy on Outcome of Thyroid Cancer\n\nA diagnosis of thyroid cancer during pregnancy has the same excellent long term survival outcomes as seen in other settings. Large retrospective studies in the US population between 1962-1999 (35-37) show similar mortality data irrespective of the diagnosis setting (inside or outside pregnancy) or the timing of surgery (during pregnancy or post-partum). Although these studies have the benefit of long follow up periods, they are inherently retrospective. Further, the ability of these studies to assess impact of pregnancy on thyroid cancer recurrence is limited, not only due to their retrospective nature, but also due to lack of availability of highly sensitive thyroglobulin assays and high resolution neck ultrasound in historic series (34).\n\nIn contrast, recent studies suggest that thyroid cancer diagnosed in pregnancy may have a higher risk of recurrence. A retrospective study from Italy showed higher rates of persistent or recurrent thyroid cancer in women diagnosed either during pregnancy or within 12 months after birth (60% persistent or recurrent disease), compared to women diagnosed with thyroid cancer more than 12 months after a pregnancy (4% persistent or recurrent disease) or women who were never pregnant (13% persistent or recurrent disease) (38). However, it is important to note that most of the pregnant women with thyroid cancer underwent surgery in the second trimester (73%), and it is possible that a more limited surgical approach in this setting may have confounded these results.\n\nSimilarly, a second retrospective Italian study found a higher rate of persistent or recurrent disease in women with thyroid cancer diagnosed within two years of a pregnancy (11%), compared to women diagnosed more than two years after a pregnancy (1%) or those who were never pregnant (5%) (39).\n\nA pathology study from Australia found that DTC diagnosed within 12 months of pregnancy were more likely to be larger, and have nodal metastases than matched controls (40).\n\nOverall, these data should reassure clinicians and patients that the impact of pregnancy on a newly diagnosed thyroid cancer is low, with excellent overall survival outcomes. Epidemiological and clinical data would suggest that the stimulatory milieu of pregnancy may contribute to a slightly higher overall risk of recurrence, which should be taken into consideration when planning follow up strategies.\n\nTiming of Thyroidectomy\n\nExpert consensus affirms that thyroidectomy can safely be performed in the second trimester, but is often more appropriately deferred to the post-partum period (34). Clinical markers of aggressive pathology, such as large primary size, rapid growth, or bulky lateral neck nodal disease, would support a strategy of earlier surgery. At present, these clinical markers of aggressiveness are detected by specialized thyroid and neck ultrasound, which should occur at first assessment, and subsequently around 20 weeks (to allow for planning of thyroidectomy in the second trimester, if indicated). Suspicion of non-DTC pathology, such as MTC and ATC, should warrant strong consideration of early surgery.\n\nThe optimal timing of surgery in the peri-partum period is uncertain. Whist many women undergo safe surgery and anesthesia in the second trimester, small risks for mother and fetus remain. However, deferring surgery to the post-partum period potentially disrupts dyadic attachment between mother and child, and may interrupt breast-feeding. As evidence is lacking, patient-centered decision making, with inputs from a multi-disciplinary team, is appropriate.\n\nSmall case series support a strategy of deferred surgery for low-risk lesions. For example, 19 women with PTC diagnosed around the time of conception were followed sonographically in pregnancy (41). Nearly 70% were microcarcinomas, and 3 cases had sonographic N1 disease. During pregnancy, 3 tumors had a detectable increase in maximal diameter, while 5 increased in volume. In 2 out of 3 with N1 disease, lymph nodes increased in size although no new nodal disease was detected, and the extent of surgery was not changed. Post-partum, 16 cases proceeded to surgery around 12 months following diagnosis.\n\nMaternal Supportive Management During Pregnancy\n\nThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a trophic factor for follicular thyroid cells and is associated with progression of thyroid cancer (23). However, there is no evidence to support the practice of pharmacological suppression of TSH to minimize growth of a primary tumor in pregnancy, and exogenous maternal hyperthyroidism is associated with fetal risk. Maintaining maternal serum TSH within the lower half of the pregnancy-specific reference range is a reasonable therapeutic goal, and levothyroxine should be initiated, if required, to achieve this target.\n\nDietary iodine should not be restricted, as it is essential for fetal thyroid development. Maternal physiological demands for iodine increase in pregnancy, and maternal iodine deficiency is associated with development of goiter in the mother.\n\nA recent cohort study found that pregnancies complicated by a diagnosis of thyroid cancer prior to or during pregnancy had a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (odds radio 2.4) and blood transfusions (odds ratio 2.1), however there was no impact on neonatal outcomes (42). Similarly, the rate of post-partum hemorrhage in women with a history of thyroid cancer was higher than controls (odds ratio 1.23) in a large retrospective observational study, however no other adverse maternal, neonatal, or child outcomes (followed to 80 months post-partum) were found (43).\n\nMeasurement of Serum Thyroglobulin\n\nDuring pregnancy, maternal serum thyroglobulin levels are higher than pre-pregnancy. This may be an effect of stimulation of maternal thyrocytes by estrogen and HCG. Therefore, maternal thyroglobulin levels during pregnancy must be interpreted with caution. Maternal serum thyroglobulin levels return to baseline values within 1-6 months of pregnancy (44-46). In general, thyroglobulin status should be assessed no earlier than 6 weeks post-partum.\n\nConsiderations in the Planning of Radioiodine Therapy\n\nRadioactive iodine therapy following total thyroidectomy, either for remnant ablation, or as adjuvant therapy, is recommended for a subset of DTC with higher risk of recurrence (32). The administration of radioiodine following pregnancy poses unique challenges, both medically and socially. Firstly, radiation safety precautions necessitate that close contact between the mother and her infant (as well as other young children) must be avoided for around 7 days following a radioactive iodine dose (precise recommendations are determined at the time of therapy) (47). Radioactive iodine is contra-indicated in pregnancy, and if administered, the risks to the fetus must be carefully assessed, based on administered dose and gestational age (48). Secondly, breast tissue expresses the sodium-iodide symporter, which is upregulated during lactation to concentrate iodine in breast milk (48, 49). Consequently, to minimize exposure of breast tissue to ionizing radiation, lactation should cease a minimum of 8 weeks before radioactive iodine and should not be recommenced so as to avoid potential breast-milk associated radioactive iodine exposure.\n\nIn light of this, the timing of radioactive iodine (if required) should be considered, balancing the potential risk of DTC progression without treatment, the benefits of a period of breastfeeding, and family unit dynamics. The literature is conflicting as to whether radioiodine administered early (within 3 months) or late (within 12 months), has any impact on prognosis. For example, a large retrospective database study including more than 9,000 patients diagnosed with high-risk PTC (primary tumor >4cm, N1 disease, positive surgical margins) found that timing of radioactive iodine within the first 12 months did not impact mortality (the median survival in this cohort was 75 months), after adjustment for confounders (50). In contrast, a small retrospective study of patients with lower risk DTC (235 cases classified as either ATA Low- or ATA-Intermediate- risk) found that deferring radioactive iodine longer than 3 months post-operatively was associated with higher rates of biochemical incomplete or structural incomplete responses compared to earlier radioactive iodine ablation(19% vs 4%) (51).\n\nPRE-CONCEPTION CARE OF WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF THYROID CANCER\n\nPregnancy following diagnosis and treatment for thyroid cancer is common, and presents specialized management issues. Nonetheless, excellent obstetric outcomes are expected (52). Pre-conception counselling is recommended for all women with a past history of thyroid cancer.\n\nChecklist: Management issues prior to pregnancy in survivors of thyroid cancer.\n\nAssessment of thyroid cancer status:\n\nRemission?

Evidently, counselling and management discussions will differ depending on what treatment has previously been received (total thyroidectomy vs hemithyroidectomy), the presence of any functional thyroid hormone production (if prior hemithyroidectomy only), the timing of any radioactive iodine administration, and the presence of any residual cancer. MicroPTC under active surveillance is a distinct management issue which is discussed separately.\n\n2015 American Thyroid Association Risk Stratification for DTC, tabulated from Haugen et al. (2016). Refer to ATA Guideline (32) for full discussion of each class and qualifying criteria (Table 13).\n\nIn women with a history of MTC, the tumor markers calcitonin and CEA are sensitive to detect residual or recurrent disease, and allow for post-operative risk stratification (53). There are no studies examining whether pregnancy impacts the prognosis of MTC.\n\nDiscussing Impact of Pregnancy on Risk of Recurrence\n\nThere is a growing body of evidence reporting the long-term oncological outcomes in the setting of pregnancy following treatment for thyroid cancer. Key studies are reviewed below.\n\nLeboeuf et al. (46) reported outcomes of 36 women between 1997 and 2006, with pregnancy a median 4 years following treatment for DTC. Three women had structural disease present prior to pregnancy, and of these, one showed growth in a cervical lymph node. A further two women developed recurrence following pregnancy that was not present on pre-operative physical examination. Of the full cohort, 22% had a sustained >20% rise in serum thyroglobulin post-partum.\n\nRosario et al. (54) describe the outcome of 64 pregnancies, occurring a median of 2.4 years after treatment for DTC. In this cohort, no patient had evidence of structural disease either prior to or following pregnancy. Of the subset 49 women with undetectable thyroglobulin prior to pregnancy, this remained undetectable in the post-partum period. Of the 8 patients with low level thyroglobulin prior to pregnancy, no significant post-partum change was observed.\n\nHirsch et al. (55) studied the outcome of 63 women, where pregnancy occurred a median of 5 years after treatment for PTC. Of the subset of 6 women with known structural disease prior to conception, 80% were found to have progressed within 12 months of birth (2 with biochemical progression, 3 with structural progression). Of the subset of 5 women with detectable pre-pregnancy thyroglobulin, no significant change was observed post-partum. Of the remaining 39 women with undetectable pre-pregnancy thyroglobulin, no progression was observed.\n\nFinally, Rakhlin et al. reported the outcome of pregnancy in 235 women following treatment for DTC (56), retrospectively grouped into ATA Response to Therapy criteria (Table 1). In the 197 women without structural disease prior to pregnancy, no new structural disease was detected following post-partum evaluation. However, 8% had a significant rise in thyroglobulin.\n\nOverall, these data are reassuring that women with an ATA Excellent response to therapy have a very low risk of DTC progression occurring during pregnancy, and a low risk of DTC progression following pregnancy. As such, additional monitoring of thyroid cancer status during pregnancy for these women is not required (34).\n\nHowever, women with biochemical or structural evidence of disease may have a progression of their thyroid cancer status as a result of pregnancy. Based on the above studies, the degree of disease progression appears minor, only affects a subset of women, and does not appear to have an impact on the outcome of the pregnancy.\n\nReducing the Impacts of Prior Thyroid Cancer Treatment on Pregnancy.\n\nLEVOTHYROXINE REPLACEMENT\n\nIt is essential that all women who are planning pregnancy receive written instructions for the management of thyroid hormone replacement prior to, and immediately following conception. Requirements for thyroid hormone rise early in gestation, in part as a result of an increase in thyroid-binding globulin. Adequate levels of thyroid hormones are required for healthy fetal development and pregnancy progression.\n\nWomen previously treated with hemithyroidectomy may unmask relative thyroid hormone deficiency following conception, and may require early initiation of levothyroxine therapy in the first trimester.\n\nWomen who have been treated with total thyroidectomy will always require an increase in thyroid hormone replacement at conception, of a magnitude between 15-40% of the total weekly dose. A common practice is to advise women to âdouble the doseâ of levothyroxine that they take on two days of the week as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, with further adjustment based on regular thyroid function tests throughout pregnancy (34, 57). Women who adhered to this advice were more likely to have TSH at the pregnancy target than those that deferred thyroxine adjustment until the first specialist consultation (58).\n\nImportantly, pregnancy multivitamins, iron supplements, or calcium supplements may interfere with the absorption of thyroxine, and women should be specifically instructed to take such supplements at a different time of day to minimize interference (59).\n\nWomen should be reassured that levothyroxine is both safe and essential for a healthy pregnancy, as inadvertent discontinuation in early pregnancy has been reported (60). In most cases, the TSH target prior to pregnancy (usually targeting the lower half of the normal range) will remain appropriate in pregnancy. Pharmacological suppression of TSH with supra-physiological doses of levothyroxine could be continued in the setting of persistent structural disease, however care should be taken to avoid overt hyperthyroidism, which increases pregnancy risk. In settings where a TSH-suppression strategy has been pursued outside of pregnancy, but in the absence of known structural disease, a careful balancing of risk and benefit should be considered, as although mild hyperthyroidism in pregnancy has not been shown to lead to maternal or fetal complications, greater degrees of hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (34, 61, 62).\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF PREVIOUS RADIOIODINE\n\nWomen should defer conception for at least 6 months after radioactive iodine administration. This period includes the expected time for radioactive iodine to fully decay (approximately 10 weeks), thus avoiding exposing the fetus to gamma-particle emission). A recent large population-based cohort study found that pregnancy occurring within 5 months of radioactive iodine had a higher rate of congenital malformations (odds ratio 1.74, 95%CI, 1.01-2.97; P = .04), which was not seen if conception occurred after 6 months (63). Deferring pregnancy for at least 6 months has the additional benefit of permitting assessment of the response to radioactive iodine therapy, and to determine that no additional treatment with radioactive iodine would be recommended in the following 15 months (conception, pregnancy and the post-partum period) (64). Stabilization of levothyroxine replacement can also take a period of months.\n\nIn the 12 months following radioactive iodine, 8-16% of women experience amenorrhea, and 12-31% have menstrual irregularities (65). Several studies (including a meta-analysis) have confirmed a small but significant fall in AMH levels following radioactive iodine, and a slightly earlier age of menopause than women who did not receive radioactive iodine (49.5 vs 51 years) (65, 66).\n\nMost studies have not shown that radioactive iodine has an impact on future fertility (65, 67, 68). However, in a retrospective database study comparing survivors of thyroid cancer, women in the age 35-39 subgroup who received radioactive iodine had a lower birth rate (11 vs 16 births per 1000 woman-years) than women who did not receive radioactive iodine. However, as the time from diagnosis of thyroid cancer to first live birth was also prolonged in this study, it is not clear whether this finding is due to physician recommendation to delay pregnancy, or the biological effects of radioactive iodine (68). In addition, a recent population case-control study found a higher rate of infertility diagnosis amongst survivors of thyroid cancer (69), however this analysis did not take into account any disease-specific factors such as type of treatment received.\n\nIn women with a history of thyroid cancer requiring assisted reproductive techniques, pregnancy outcomes were not different compared to controls, although the number of retrieved oocytes was lower (70). A history of radioactive iodine treatment was not associated with differing rates of clinical pregnancy or live birth rates in this group (71).\n\nA large longitudinal study followed 2,673 pregnancies and did not show an increase in maternal or fetal adverse events in women previously administered radioactive iodine (72). A population-based cohort study of women with thyroid cancer in Korea, comparing 59,483 women who underwent thyroidectomy alone, with 51,976 women who had thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine found no difference in pregnancy or obstetric outcomes in the 9.7% of the cohort where pregnancy occurred (63). A further systematic review (67), and meta-analysis (73), pooling additional studies reported similar findings, providing sufficient time had elapsed following radioactive iodine administration.\n\nIn men, radioactive iodine may transiently impact testicular function, with a short-term rise in FSH, and decrease in normal sperm morphology seen in prospective studies (74). It is suggested that men avoid fathering children for 4 months following radioactive iodine (75, 76). In men who desire fertility, and who are expected to require high cumulative activities of radioactive iodine, sperm banking should be considered.\n\nSurveillance and Monitoring During Pregnancy\n\nBased on available data, women with no structural or biochemical evidence of thyroid cancer do not require DTC-specific monitoring during pregnancy. At present, there is no evidence to guide whether additional post-partum surveillance should be instituted beyond that womanâs current surveillance strategy, however consideration of neck ultrasound and serum thyroglobulin at least 6 months post-partum is reasonable.\n\nFor women with âATA Biochemical Incompleteâ or âATA Indeterminateâ classification, surveillance during pregnancy could include periodic neck ultrasound, and determination of thyroglobulin and Tg-Ab levels. Clear evidence of progression of thyroid cancer could prompt an increase in the level of TSH suppression, or rarely prompt expedited delivery. Management in the context of a multidisciplinary team is advised.\n\nCONTINUED ACTIVE SURVELLANCE OF PAPILLARY THRYOID MICROCARCINOMA DURING PREGNANCY\n\nNon-operative management of microPTC (<10mm in maximal dimension) is increasing, with emerging data on implications for active surveillance during pregnancy. Shindo et al report 9 women with microPTC followed during pregnancy, finding demonstrable growth in 44% (compared to microPTC growth of 11% in non-pregnant controls) (77). Ito et al reported outcomes of 50 pregnancies with microPTC, finding growth of >1mm in 8%, reduced size in 2%. The remaining 90% of cases showed no growth in pregnancy, and there were no nodal metastases detected (78). Oh et al described 13 microPTC in pregnancy, with a single lesion demonstrating growth (41). The available evidence supports the continuation of active surveillance during pregnancy, monitored with periodic neck ultrasound. However, women contemplating pregnancy who are under active surveillance should be advised that a small number of microPTC will grow during pregnancy, and this may result in anxiety for the patient and clinicians. Further studies are awaited in this population (32).\n\nGermline RET Mutations\n\nWomen with clinically diagnosed MEN2, or who carry a germline mutation in the REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene, should be under the care of a specialized clinical team, and should be offered detailed pre-natal genetic counselling. Individual RET mutations can be characterized for their risk of early-onset MTC, allowing personalized management decisions. The highest risk mutations should prompt consideration of total thyroidectomy in early childhood (53). The presence of hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma should be biochemically excluded prior to pregnancy in any woman with MEN2.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF KNOWN RESIDUAL STRUCTURAL DISEASE IN PREGNANCY\n\nCase series of pregnancy in women with co-existent thyroid cancer metastases have been reported. The largest study retrospectively studied a cohort of 124 women from China, aged 16-35 years, with lung metastases from thyroid cancer, stratified by whether pregnancy occurred (n=35) and followed for a median 68-82 months after completing treatment with radioactive iodine (79). This study found that pregnancy after thyroid cancer had no measurable difference in 5 year or 10-year progression free survival or overall survival. 10-year overall survival in the pregnancy group was 86%, compared to 82% in the non-pregnant group. Although the groups appeared to have similar characteristics, it remains possible that women who chose pregnancy had a lower severity of disease than those who avoided pregnancy.\n\nAnother study retrospectively described outcomes for 38 women at a large cancer center in the USA (56). Included in the cohort were 10 women with pulmonary metastases at the time of diagnosis (and of whom 7 had persistent structural disease prior to pregnancy). During pregnancy, 29% of women had progression of structural disease (11/38, with 5/38 increasing size of known abnormal nodes, 3/38 with newly abnormal lymph nodes, and 1/38 with progression of distant metastases). In total, 3/38 (~8%) were considered âclinically significantâ by the study team (required further treatment within 12 months of birth).\n\nThese data are reassuring that the clinical impact of pregnancy in the setting of persistent structural disease appears low, despite in vitro studies and smaller case series confirming that pregnancy represents a potentially stimulatory setting for thyroid cancer cells.\n\nIn general, TSH suppression should be maintained where benefit is felt to outweigh risk to the pregnancy. Serial neck ultrasound during pregnancy will monitor the status of neck disease, however imaging the chest is usually avoided to minimize ionizing radiation to the chest. Where progression of lung metastases is to be monitored, serial lung function testing may be informative.\n\nCurrently approved small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to have embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits (80, 81), and pregnancy should be avoided in women on this treatment. A case report of a pregnancy in a women treated with vandetanib up until 6 weeks gestation described no fetal adverse outcomes (82).\n\nREFERENCES\n\nOduncu FS, Kimmig R, Hepp H, Emmerich B.

Between thirty and seventy percent of patients with diabetes mellitus, both type 1 and type 2, will present with a cutaneous complication of diabetes mellitus at some point during their lifetime. A variety of dermatologic manifestations have been linked with diabetes mellitus; these conditions vary in severity and can be benign, deforming, and even life-threatening. Such skin changes can offer insight into patientsâ glycemic control and may be the first sign of metabolic derangement in undiagnosed patients with diabetes. Recognition and management of these conditions is important in maximizing the quality of life and in avoiding serious adverse effects in patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe changes associated with diabetes mellitus can affect multiple organ systems. Between thirty and seventy percent of patients with diabetes mellitus, both type 1 and type 2, will present with a cutaneous complication of diabetes mellitus at some point during their lifetime (1). Dermatologic manifestations of diabetes mellitus have various health implications ranging from those that are aesthetically concerning to those that may be life-threatening. Awareness of cutaneous manifestations of diabetes mellitus can provide insight into the present or prior metabolic status of patients. The recognition of such findings may aid in the diagnosis of diabetes, or may be followed as a marker of glycemic control. The text that follows describes the relationship between diabetes mellitus and the skin, more specifically: (1) skin manifestations strongly associated with diabetes, (2) non-specific dermatologic signs and symptoms associated with diabetes, (3) dermatologic diseases associated with diabetes, (4) common skin infections in diabetes, and (5) cutaneous changes associated with diabetes medications.\n\nSKIN MANIFESTATIONS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES MELLITUS\n\nAcanthosis Nigricans\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nAcanthosis nigricans (AN) is a classic dermatologic manifestation of diabetes mellitus that affects men and women of all ages. AN is more common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (2) and is more prevalent in those with darker-skin color. AN is disproportionately represented in African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans (3). AN is observed in a variety of endocrinopathies associated with resistance to insulin such as acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and thyroid dysfunction. Unrelated to insulin resistance, AN can also be associated with malignancies such as gastric adenocarcinomas and other carcinomas (4).\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nAN presents chronically as multiple poorly demarcated plaques with grey to dark-brown hyperpigmentation and a thickened velvety to verrucous texture. Classically, AN has a symmetrical distribution and is located in intertriginous or flexural surfaces such as the back of the neck, axilla, elbows, palmer hands (also known as âtripe palmsâ), inframammary creases, umbilicus, or groin. Affected areas are asymptomatic; however, extensive involvement may cause discomfort or fetor. Microscopy shows hyperkeratosis and epidermal papillomatosis with acanthosis. The changes in skin pigmentation are primarily a consequence of hyperkeratosis, not changes in melanin. AN can present prior to the clinical diagnosis of diabetes; the presence of AN should prompt evaluation for diabetes mellitus and for other signs of insulin resistance.\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nThe pathogenesis of AN is not completely understood. The predominant theory is that a hyperinsulin state activates insulin growth factor receptors (IGF), specifically IGF-1, on keratinocytes and fibroblasts, provoking cell proliferation, resulting in the aforementioned cutaneous manifestations of AN (5,6).\n\nTREATMENT\n\nTreatment of AN may improve current lesions and prevent future cutaneous manifestations. AN is best managed with lifestyle changes such as dietary modifications, increased physical activity, and weight reduction. In patients with diabetes, pharmacologic adjuvants, such as metformin, that improve glycemic control and reduce insulin resistance are also beneficial (7). Primary dermatologic therapies are usually ineffective especially in patients with generalized involvement. However, in those with thickened or macerated areas of skin, oral retinoids or topical keratolytics such as ammonium lactate, retinoic acid, or salicylic acid can be used to alleviate symptoms (8-10).\n\nDiabetic Dermopathy\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nDermopathy (DD), also known as pigmented pretibial patches or diabetic shin spots, is the most common dermatologic manifestations of diabetes, presenting in as many as one-half of those with diabetes (11). Although disputed, some consider the presence of DD to be pathognomonic for diabetes. DD has a strong predilection for men and those older than 50 years of age (12). Although DD may antecede the onset of diabetes, it occurs more frequently as a late complication of diabetes and in those with microvascular disease. Nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy are regularly present in patients with DD. An association with cardiovascular disease has also been identified, with one study showing 53% of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with DD had coexisting coronary artery disease (13).\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nDD initially presents with rounded, dull, red papules that progressively evolve over one-to-two weeks into well-circumscribed, atrophic, brown macules with a fine scale (figure 1). Normally after about eighteen to twenty-four months, lesions dissipate and leave behind an area of concavity and hyperpigmentation. At any time, different lesions can present at different stages of evolution. The lesions are normally distributed bilaterally and localized over bony prominences. The pretibial area is most commonly involved, although other bony prominences such as the forearms, lateral malleoli or thighs may also be involved. Aside from the aforementioned changes, patients are otherwise asymptomatic. DD is a clinical diagnosis that should not require a skin biopsy. Histologically, DD is rather nonspecific; it is characterized by lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding vasculature, engorged blood vessels in the papillary dermis, and dispersed hemosiderin deposits. Moreover, the histology varies based on the stage of the lesion. Immature lesions present with epidermal edema as opposed to epidermal atrophy which is representative of older lesions (14).\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nThe origin of DD remains unclear, however, mild trauma to affected areas (15), hemosiderin and melanin deposition (16), microangiopathic changes (17), and destruction of subcutaneous nerves (18) have all been suggested.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nTreatment is typically avoided given the asymptomatic and self-resolving nature of DD as well as the ineffectiveness of available treatments. However, DD often occurs in the context of microvascular complications and neuropathies (12); hence, patients need to be examined and followed more rigorously for these complications. Although it is important to manage diabetes and its complications accordingly, there is no evidence that improved glycemic control alters the development of DD.\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nDiabetic Foot Syndrome (DFS) encompasses the neuropathic and vasculopathic complications that develop in the feet of patients with diabetes. Although preventable, DFS is a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, and reduction in quality of life of patients with diabetes. The incidence and prevalence of DFS in patients with diabetes is 1% to 4% and 4% to 10%, respectively (19). Furthermore, DFS is slightly more prevalent in type 1 diabetes compared with type 2 diabetes (20). A more comprehensive review of diabetic foot syndrome can be found in The Diabetic Foot chapter of Endotext.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nDFS presents initially with callosities and dry skin related to diabetic neuropathy. In later stages, chronic ulcers and a variety of other malformations of the feet develop. Between 15% and 25% of patients with diabetes will develop ulcers (21). Ulcers may be neuropathic, ischemic, or mixed. The most common type of ulcers are neuropathic ulcers, a painless ulceration resulting from peripheral neuropathy. Ulcers associated with peripheral vascular ischemia are painful but less common. Ulcers tend to occur in areas prone to trauma, classically presenting at the site of calluses or over bony prominences. It is common for ulcers to occur on the toes, forefoot, and ankles. Untreated ulcers usually heal within one year, however, fifty percent of patients with diabetes will have recurrence of the ulcer within three years (22). The skin of affected patients, especially in those with type 2 diabetes, is more prone to fungal infection and the toe webs are a common port of entry for fungi which can then infect and complicate ulcers (23). Secondary infection of ulcers is a serious complication that can result in gangrenous necrosis, osteomyelitis, and may even require lower extremity amputation. Another complication, diabetic neuro-osteoarthropathy (also known as Charcot foot), is an irreversible debilitating and deforming condition involving progressive destruction of weight-bearing bones and joints. Diabetic neuro-osteoarthropathy occurs most frequently in the feet and can result in collapse of the midfoot, referred to as ârocker-bottom foot.â Moreover, a reduction of the intrinsic muscle volume and thickening of the plantar aponeurosis can cause a muscular imbalance that produces a clawing deformation of the toes. An additional complication of diabetes and neuropathy involving the feet is erythromelalgia. Erythromelalgia presents with redness, warmth, and a burning pain involving the lower extremities, most often the feet. Symptoms may worsen in patients with erythromelalgia with exercise or heat exposure and may improve with cooling (24).\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nThe pathogenesis of DFS involves a combination of inciting factors that coexist together: neuropathy (25), atherosclerosis (25), and impaired wound healing (26). In the setting of long-standing hyperglycemia, there is an increase in advanced glycosylation end products, proinflammatory factors, and oxidative stress which results in the demyelination of nerves and subsequent neuropathy (27,28). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that there is a unique subset of fibroblasts that overexpress factors associated with healing within the wound bed as opposed to the wound edge (28A). Additionally, wound healers demonstrate an increase in M1 macrophages as opposed to non-wound healers which have an increase in M2 macrophages. The effect on sensory and motor nerves, can blunt the perception of adverse stimuli and produce an altered gait, increasing the likelihood of developing foot ulcers and malformations. Also damage to autonomic nerve fibers causes a reduction in sweating which may leave skin in the lower extremity dehydrated and prone to fissures and secondary infection (29). In addition to neuropathy, accelerated arterial atherosclerosis can lead to peripheral ischemia and ulceration (30). It has been reported that diabetic patients with Charcot neuroarthropathy are associated with greater impairment of cutaneous microvascular reactivity when compared to non-complicated diabetic groups (30A). Finally, hyperglycemia impairs macrophage functionality as well as increases and prolongs the inflammatory response, slowing the healing of ulcers (31).\n\nTREATMENT\n\nTreatment should involve an interdisciplinary team-based approach with a focus on prevention and management of current ulcers. Prevention entails daily surveillance, appropriate foot hygiene, and proper footwear, walkers, or other devices to minimize and distribute pressure. An appropriate wound care program should be used to care for ongoing ulcers. Different classes of wound dressing should be considered based on the wound type. Hydrogels, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, topical growth factors, and biofabricated skin grafts are also available (19). The clinical presentation should indicate whether antibiotic therapy or wound debridement is necessary (19). In patients with chronic treatment resistant ulcers, underlying ischemia should be considered; these patients may require surgical revascularization or bypass.\n\nDiabetic Thick Skin\n\nSkin thickening is frequently observed in patients with diabetes. Affected areas of skin can appear thickened, waxy, or edematous. These patients are often asymptomatic but can have a reduction in sensation and pain. Although different parts of the body can be involved, the hands and feet are most frequently involved. Ultrasound evaluation of the skin can be diagnostic and exhibit thickened skin. Subclinical generalized skin thickening is the most common type of skin thickening. Diabetic thick skin may represent another manifestation of scleroderma-like skin changes or limited joint mobility, which are each described in more detail below.\n\nScleroderma-Like Skin Changes\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nScleroderma-like skin changes are a distinct and easily overlooked group of findings that are commonly observed in patients with diabetes. Ten to fifty percent of patients with diabetes present with the associated skin findings (32). Scleroderma-like skin changes occurs more commonly in those with type 1 diabetes and in those with longstanding disease (33). There is no known variation in prevalence between males and females, or between racial groups.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nScleroderma-like skin changes develop slowly and present with painless, indurated, occasionally waxy appearing, thickened skin. These changes occur symmetrically and bilaterally in acral areas. In patients with scleroderma-like skin changes the acral areas are involved, specifically the dorsum of the fingers (sclerodactyly), proximal interphalangeal, and metacarpophalangeal joints. Severe disease may extend centrally from the hands to the arms or back. A small number of patients with diabetes may develop more extensive disease, which presents earlier and with truncal involvement. The risk of developing nephropathy and retinopathy is increased in those with scleroderma-like skin changes who also have type 1 diabetes (33,34). The aforementioned symptoms are also associated with diabetic hand syndrome which may present with limited joint mobility, palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren's contracture), and stenosing tenosynovitis (âtrigger fingerâ) (35). The physical exam finding known as the âprayer signâ (inability to flushly press palmar surfaces on each hand together) may be present in patients with diabetic hand syndrome and scleroderma-like skin changes (36). On histology, scleroderma-like skin changes reveal thickening of the dermis, minimal-to-absent mucin, and increased interlinking of collagen. Although on physical exam scleroderma may be difficult to distinguish from these skin changes, scleroderma-like skin changes are not associated with atrophy of the dermis, Raynaudâs syndrome, pain, or telangiectasias.\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nAlthough not fully understood, the pathogenesis is believed to involve the strengthening of collagen as a result of reactions associated with advanced glycosylation end products or a buildup of sugar alcohols in the upper dermis (37,38).\n\nTREATMENT\n\nScleroderma-like skin changes is a chronic condition that is also associated with joint and microvascular complication. Therapeutic options are extremely limited. One observational report has suggested that very tight blood sugar control may result in the narrowing of thickened skin (39). In addition, aldose reductase inhibitors, which limit increases in sugar alcohols, may be efficacious (38). In patients with restricted ranges of motions, physical therapy can help to maintain and improve joint mobility.\n\nLimited Joint Mobility\n\nLimited Joint Mobility (LJM), also known as diabetic cheiroarthropathy, is a relatively common complication of long-standing diabetes mellitus. The majority of patients with LJM also present with scleroderma-like skin changes (38,40). The prevalence of LJM is 4% to 26% in patients without diabetes and 8% to 58% in patients with diabetes (41). LJM presents with progressive flexed contractures and hindered joint extension, most commonly involving the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the hand. The earliest changes often begin in the joints of the fifth finger before then spreading to involve the other joints of the hand (38). Patients may present with an inability to flushly press the palmar surfaces of each of their hands together (âprayer signâ) (figure 2) or against the surface of a table when their forearms are perpendicular to the surface of the table (âtabletop signâ) (42). These changes occur as a result of periarticular enlargement of connective tissue. The pathogenesis likely involves hyperglycemia induced formation of advanced glycation end-products, which accumulate to promote inflammation and the formation of stiffening cross-links between collagen (43). LJM is strongly associated with microvascular and macrovascular changes and diagnosis of LJM should prompt a workup for related sequela (44). Patients with LJM may also be at increased risk for falls (45). There are no curative treatments. Symptomatic patients may benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or targeted injection of corticosteroids (43). LJM is best managed with improved glycemic control (46), as well as, regular stretching to maintain and minimize further limitations in joint mobility.\n\nScleredema Diabetocorum\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nScleredema diabeticorum is a chronic and slowly progressive sclerotic skin disorder that is often seen in the context of diabetes. Whereas 2.5% to 14% of all patients with diabetes have scleredema, over 50% of those with scleredema present with concomitant diabetes (47). Scleredema has a proclivity for those with a long history of diabetes. It remains unclear whether there is a predilection for scleredema in those with type 1 diabetes (48) compared to those with type 2 diabetes (48). Women are affected more often than men (49). Although all ages are affected, scleredema occurs more frequently in those over the age of twenty (48,49).\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nScleredema presents with gradually worsening indurated and thickened skin. These skin changes occur symmetrically and diffusely. The most commonly involved areas are the upper back, shoulders, and back of the neck. The face, chest, abdomen, buttocks, and thighs may also be involved; however, the distal extremities are classically spared. The affected areas are normally asymptomatic but there can be reduced sensation. Patients with severe longstanding disease may develop a reduced range of motion, most often affecting the trunk. In extreme cases, this can lead to restrictive respiratory problems. A full thickness skin biopsy may be useful in supporting a clinical presentation. The histology of scleredema displays increased collagen and a thickened reticular dermis, with a surrounding mucinous infiltrate, without edema or sclerosis.\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nAlthough many theories center on abnormalities in collagen, there is no a consensus regarding the pathogenesis of scleredema. The pathogenesis of scleredema may involve an interplay between non-enzymatic glycosylation of collagen, increased fibroblast production of collagen, or decreases in collagen breakdown (50,51).\n\nTREATMENT\n\nScleredema diabeticorum is normally unresolving and slowly progressive over years. Improved glycemic control may be an important means of prevention but evidence has not shown clinical improvements in those already affected by scleredema diabeticorum. A variety of therapeutic options have been proposed with variable efficacy. Some of these therapies include immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and electron-beam therapy (52). Phototherapy with UVA1 or PUVA may be effective in those that are severely affected (52). Independent of other treatments, physical therapy is an important therapeutic modality for patients with scleredema and reduced mobility (53).\n\nNecrobiosis Lipoidica\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nNecrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a rare chronic granulomatous dermatologic disease that is seen most frequently in patients with diabetes. Although nearly one in four patients presenting with NL will also have diabetes, less than 1% of patients with diabetes will develop NL (54). For unknown reasons, NL expresses a strong predilection for women compared to men (55). NL generally occurs in type 1 diabetes during the third decade of life, as opposed to type 2 diabetes in which it commonly presents in the fourth or fifth decades of life (54). The majority of cases of NL presents years after a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus; however, 14% to 24% of cases of NL may occur prior to or at the time of diagnosis (56). One study evaluating comorbidities and diabetic complications in patients with NL found high rates of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, thyroid disease, poor kidney function, and poor glucose control (56A). The highest comorbidity rates in patients with NL were patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nNL begins as a single or group of firm well-demarcated rounded erythematous papules (figure 3). The papules then expand and aggregate into plaques characterized by circumferential red-brown borders and a firm yellow-brown waxen atrophic center containing telangiectasias. NL occurs bilaterally and exhibits Koebnerization. Lesions are almost always found on the pretibial areas of the lower extremities. Additional involvement of the forearm, scalp, distal upper extremities, face, or abdomen may be present on occasion, and the heel of the foot or glans penis even more infrequently. If left untreated, only about 15% of lesions will resolve within twelve years. Despite the pronounced appearance of the lesions, NL is often asymptomatic. However, there may be pruritus and hypoesthesia of affected areas, and pain may be present in the context of ulceration. Ulceration occurs in about one-third of lesions, and has been associated with secondary infections and squamous cell carcinoma. The histology of NL primarily involves the dermis and is marked by palisading granulomatous inflammation, necrobiotic collagen, a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, blood vessel wall thickening, and reduced mucin.\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nThe pathogenesis of NL is not well understood. The relationship between diabetes and NL has led some to theorize that diabetes-related microangiopathy is related to the development of NL (54). Other theories focus on irregularities in collagen, autoimmune disease, neutrophil chemotaxis, or blood vessels (57).\n\nTREATMENT\n\nNL is a chronic, disfiguring condition that can be debilitating for patients and difficult for clinicians to manage. Differing degrees of success have been reported with a variety of treatments; however, the majority of such reports are limited by inconsistent treatment responses in patients and a lack of large controlled studies. Corticosteroids are often used in the management of NL and may be administered topically, intralesionally, or orally. Corticosteroids can be used to manage active lesions, but is best not used in areas that are atrophic. Success has also been reported with calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine), anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (e.g., infliximab), pentoxifylline, antimalarials (e.g., hydroxychloroquine), PUVA, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, dipyridamole, and low-dose aspirin (54). Appropriate wound care is important for ulcerated lesions; this often includes topical antibiotics, protecting areas vulnerable to injury, emollients, and compression bandaging. Surgical excision of ulcers typically has poor results. Some ulcerated lesion may improve with split-skin grafting. Although still recommended, improved control of diabetes has not been found to lead to an improvement in skin lesions. Patients with newly diagnosed NL should be screened for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and thyroid disease (56A).\n\nBullosis Diabeticorum\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nBullosis diabeticorum (BD) is an uncommon eruptive blistering condition that presents in those with diabetes mellitus. Although BD can occasionally present in early-diabetes (58), it often occurs in long-standing diabetes along with other complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. In the United States, the prevalence of BD is around 0.5% amongst patients with diabetes and is believed to be higher in those with type 1 diabetes (13). BD is significantly more common in male patients than in female patients (59). The average age of onset is between 50 and 70 years of age (59).\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nBD presents at sites of previously healthy-appearing skin with the abrupt onset of one or more non-erythematous, firm, sterile bullae. Shortly after forming, bullae increase in size and become more flaccid, ranging in size from about 0.5 cm to 5 cm. Bullae frequently present bilaterally involving the acral areas of the lower extremities. However, involvement of the upper extremities and even more rarely the trunk can be seen. The bullae and the adjacent areas are nontender. BD often presents acutely, classically overnight, with no history of trauma to the affected area. Generally, the bullae heal within two to six weeks, but then commonly reoccur. Histological findings are often non-specific but are useful in distinguishing BD from other bullous diseases. Histology, typically shows an intraepidermal or subepidermal blister, spongiosis, no acantholysis, minimal inflammatory infiltrate, and normal immunofluorescence.\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nThere is an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of BD and no consensus regarding a leading theory. Various mechanisms have been proposed, some of which focus on autoimmune processes, exposure to ultraviolet light, variations in blood glucose, neuropathy, or changes in microvasculature (60).\n\nTREATMENT\n\nBD resolve without treatment and are therefore managed by avoiding secondary infection and the corresponding sequelae (e.g., necrosis, osteomyelitis). This involves protection of the affected skin, leaving blisters intact (except for large blisters, which may be aspirated to prevent rupture), and monitoring for infection. Topical antibiotics are not necessary unless specifically indicated, such as with secondary infection or positive culture.\n\nNONSPECIFIC DERMATOLOGIC SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\n\nIchthyosiform Changes of the Shins\n\nIchthyosiform changes of the shins presents with large bilateral areas of dryness and scaling (sometimes described as âfish scaleâ skin) (figure 4). Although cutaneous changes may occur on the hands or feet, the anterior shin is most classically involved. These cutaneous changes are related to rapid skin aging and adhesion defects in the stratum corneum (61). The prevalence of ichthyosiform changes of the shins in those with type 1 diabetes has been reported to be between 22% to 48% (33,62). These changes present relatively early in the disease course of diabetes. There is no known difference in prevalence between males and females (33). The development of ichthyosiform changes of the shins is related to production of advanced glycosylation end products and microangiopathic changes. Treatment is limited but topical emollients or keratolytic agents may be beneficial (61).\n\nXerosis\n\nXerosis is one of the most common skin presentations in patients with diabetes and has been reported to be present in as many as 40% of patients with diabetes (63). Xerosis refers to skin that is abnormally dry. Affected skin may present with scaling, cracks, or a rough texture. These skin changes are most frequently located on the feet of patients with diabetes. It has been reported that diabetic patients that are obese will experience more severe hypohidrosis of the feet (63A). In patients with diabetes, xerosis occurs often in the context of microvascular complications (40). To avoid complications such as fissures and secondary infections, xerosis can be managed with emollients like ammonium lactate (64).\n\nAcquired Perforating Dermatosis\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nPerforating dermatoses refers to a broad group of chronic skin disorders characterized by a loss of dermal connective tissue. A subset of perforating dermatoses, known as acquired perforating dermatoses (APD), encompasses those perforating dermatoses that are associated with systemic diseases. Although APD may be seen with any systemic diseases, it is classically observed in patients with chronic renal failure or long-standing diabetes (65). APD occurs most often in adulthood in patients between the ages of 30 and 90 years of age (65,66). The prevalence of APD is unknown. It is estimated that of those diagnosed with APD about 15% also have diabetes mellitus (67). In a review, 4.5% to 10% of patients with chronic renal failure presented with concurrent APD (68,69).\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nAPD presents as groups of hyperkeratotic umbilicated-nodules and papules with centralized keratin plugs. The lesions undergo Koebnerization and hence the extensor surfaces of the arms and more commonly the legs are often involved; eruptions also occur frequently on the trunk. However, lesions can develop anywhere on the body. Lesions are extremely pruritic and are aggravated by excoriation. Eruptions may improve after a few months but an area of hyperpigmentation typically remains. Histologically, perforating dermatoses are characterized by a lymphocytic infiltrate, an absence or degeneration of dermal connective tissue components (e.g., collagen, elastic fibers), and transepidermal extrusion of keratotic material.\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nThe underlying pathogenesis is disputed and not fully understood. It has been suggested that repetitive superficial trauma from chronic scratching may induce epidermal or dermal derangements (70). The glycosylation of microvasculature or dermal components has been suggested as well. Other hypotheses have implicated additional metabolic disturbances, or the accumulation of unknown immunogenic substances that are not eliminated by dialysis (65). APD is also considered a form of prurigo nodularis (70A).\n\nTREATMENT\n\nAPD can be challenging to treat and many of the interventions have variable efficacy. Minimizing scratching and other traumas to involved areas can allow lesions to resolve over a period of months. This is best achieved with symptomatic relief of pruritus. Individual lesions can be managed with topical agents such as keratolytics (e.g., 5% to 7% salicylic acid), retinoids (e.g., 0.01% to 0.1% tretinoin), or high-potency steroids (71). Refractory lesions may respond to intralesional steroid injections or cryotherapy (71). A common initial approach is a topical steroid in combination with emollients and an oral antihistamine. Generalized symptoms may improve with systemic therapy with oral retinoids, psoralen plus UVA light (PUVA), allopurinol (100 mg daily for 2 to 4 months), or oral antibiotics (doxycycline or clindamycin) (72). Additionally, as APD is a form of prurigo nodularis, the use of immunomodulating agents such as dupilumab may be effective in treating the condition. There is evidence of dupilumab monotherapy effectively treating certain forms of APD (72A). Nevertheless, effective management of the underlying systemic disease is fundamental to the treatment of APD. In those with diabetes, APD is unlikely to improve without improved blood sugar control. Moreover, dialysis does not reduce symptoms; however, renal transplantation can result in the improvement and resolution of cutaneous lesions.\n\nEruptive Xanthomas\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nEruptive xanthomas (EX) is a clinical presentation of hypertriglyceridemia, generally associated with serum triglycerides above 2,000 mg/dL (73). However, in patients with diabetes, lower levels of triglycerides may be associated with EX. The prevalence of EX is around one percent in type 1 diabetes and two percent in type 2 diabetes (74,75). Serum lipid abnormalities are present in about seventy-five percent of patients with diabetes (76).\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nEX has been reported as the first presenting sign of diabetes mellitus, granting it can present at any time in the disease course. EX presents as eruptions of clusters of glossy pink-to-yellow papules, ranging in diameter from 1 mm to 4 mm, overlying an erythematous area (figure 5). The lesions can be found on extensor surfaces of the extremities, the buttocks, and in areas susceptible in Koebnerization. EX is usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic or tender. The histology reveals a mixed inflammatory infiltrate of the dermis which includes triglyceride containing macrophages, also referred to as foam cells.\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nLipoprotein lipase, a key enzyme in the metabolism of triglyceride rich lipoproteins, is stimulated by insulin. In an insulin deficient state, such as poorly controlled diabetes, there is decreased lipoprotein lipase activity resulting in the accumulation of chylomicrons and other triglyceride rich lipoproteins (77). Increased levels of these substances are scavenged by macrophages (78). These lipid-laden macrophages then collect in the dermis of the skin where they can lead to eruptive xanthomas.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nEX can resolve with improved glycemic control and a reduction in serum triglyceride levels (79). This may be achieved with fibrates or omega-3-fatty acids in addition to an appropriate insulin regimen (80). A more comprehensive review of the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia can be found in the Triglyceride Lowering Drugs section of Endotext.\n\nAcrochordons\n\nAcrochordons (also known as soft benign fibromas, fibroepithlial polyps, or skin tags) are benign, soft, pedunculated growths that vary in size and can occur singularly or in groups (figure 6). The neck, axilla, and periorbital area, are most frequently involved, although other intertriginous areas can also be affected. Skin tags are common in the general population, but are more prevalent in those with increased weight or age, and in women. It has been reported that as many as three out of four patients presenting with acrochordons also have diabetes mellitus (81). Patients with acanthosis nigricans may have acrochordons overlying the affected areas of skin. Although disputed, some studies have suggested that the amount of skin tags on an individual may correspond with an individual's risk of diabetes or insulin resistance (82). Excision or cryotherapy is not medically indicated but may be considered in those with symptomatic or cosmetically displeasing lesions.\n\nDiabetes-Associated Pruritus\n\nDiabetes can be associated with pruritus, more often localized than generalized. Affected areas can include the scalp, ankles, feet, trunk, or genitalia (83,84). Pruritus is more likely in patients with diabetes who have dry skin or diabetic neuropathy. Specifically, for type 2 diabetes, risk factors for pruritus were identified to be age, duration of disease, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic chronic kidney disease, and fasting plasma glucose levels (84A). Involvement of the genitalia or intertriginous areas may occur in the setting of infection (e.g., candidiasis). Treatments include topical capsaicin, topical ketamine-amitriptyline-lidocaine, oral anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin or pregabalin), and, in the case of candida infection, antifungals.\n\nHuntleyâs Papules (Finger Pebbles)\n\nHuntleyâs papules, also known as finger pebbles, are a benign cutaneous finding affecting the hands. Patients present with clusters of non-erythematous, asymptomatic, small papules on the dorsal surface of the hand, specifically affecting the metacarpophalangeal joints and periungual areas. The clusters of small papules can develop into coalescent plaques. Other associated cutaneous findings include hypopigmentation and induration of the skin. Huntleyâs papules are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes and may be an early sign of diabetic thick skin (85,86). Topical therapies are usually ineffective; however, patients suffering from excessive dryness of the skin may benefit from 12% ammonium lactate cream (87).\n\nKeratosis Pilaris\n\nKeratosis pilaris is a very common benign keratotic disorder. Patients with keratosis pilaris classically present with areas of keratotic perifollicular papules with surrounding erythema or hyperpigmentation (figure 7). The posterior surfaces of the upper arms are often affected but involvement of the thighs, face, and buttocks can also be seen. Compared to the general population, keratosis pilaris occurs more frequently and with more extensive involvement of the skin in those with diabetes (33,62). Keratosis pilaris can be treated with various topical therapies, including salicylic acid, moisturizers, and emollients.\n\nPigmented Purpuric Dermatoses\n\nPigmented purpuric dermatoses (also known as pigmented purpura) are associated with diabetes, more often in the elderly, and frequently coexists with diabetic dermopathy (88,89). Pigmented purpura presents with non-blanching copper-colored patches involving the pretibial areas of the legs or the dorsum of the feet. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic. Pigmented purpuric dermatoses occur more often in late-stage diabetes in patients with nephropathy and retinopathy as a result of microangiopathic damage to capillaries and sequential erythrocyte deposition (90).\n\nPalmar Erythema\n\nPalmar erythema is a benign finding that presents with symmetric redness and warmth involving the palms. The erythema is asymptomatic and often most heavily affects the hypothenar and thenar eminences of the palms. The microvascular complications of diabetes are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of palmar erythema (91). Although diabetes associated palmar erythema is distinct from physiologic mottled skin, it is similar to other types of palmar erythema such as those related to pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nPeriungual Telangiectasias\n\nAs many as one in every two patients with diabetes are affected by periungual telangiectasias (92). Periungual telangiectasias presents asymptomatically with erythema and telangiectasias surrounding the proximal nail folds (71). Such findings may occur in association with âraggedâ cuticles and fingertip tenderness. The cutaneous findings are due to venous capillary dilatation that occurs secondary to diabetic microangiopathy. Capillary abnormalities, such as venous capillary tortuosity, may differ and can represent an early manifestation of diabetes-related microangiopathy (93).\n\nRubeosis Faciei\n\nRubeosis faciei is a benign finding present in about 7% of patients with diabetes; however, in hospitalized patients, the prevalence may exceed 50% (94). Rubeosis faciei presents with chronic erythema of the face or neck. Telangiectasias may also be visible. The flushed appearance is often more prominent in those with lighter colored skin. The flushed appearance is thought to occur secondary to small vessel dilation and microangiopathic changes. Complications of diabetes mellitus, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy are also associated with rubeosis faciei (90). Facial erythema may improve with better glycemic control and reduction of caffeine or alcohol intake.\n\nYellow Skin and Nails\n\nIt is common for patients with diabetes, particularly elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, to present with asymptomatic yellow discolorations of their skin or fingernails. These benign changes commonly involve the palms, soles, face, or the distal nail of the first toe. The accumulation of various substances (e.g., carotene, glycosylated proteins) in patients with diabetes may be responsible for the changes in complexion; however, the pathogenesis remains controversial (95).\n\nOnychocryptosis\n\nOnychocryptosis, or ingrown toenails, have been reported in patients with diabetes, specifically type 2 diabetes (95A). The great toes are most affected. It is hypothesized that this nail change can occur in diabetic patients because onychocryptosis is correlated with increased body mass index, trauma, weak vascular supply, nail plate dysfunction, and subungual hyperkeratosis.\n\nDERMATOLOGIC DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES\n\nGeneralized Granuloma Annulare\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nAlthough various forms of granuloma annulare exist, only generalized granuloma annulare (GGA) is thought to be associated with diabetes. It is estimated that between ten and fifteen percent of cases of GGA occur in patients with diabetes (96). Meanwhile, less than one percent of patients with diabetes present with GGA. GGA occurs around the average age of 50 years. It occurs more frequently in women than in men, and in those with type 1 diabetes (97).\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nGGA initially presents with groups of skin-colored or reddish, firm papules which slowly grow and centrally involute to then form hypo- or hyper-pigmented annular rings with elevated circumferential borders. The lesions can range in size from 0.5 cm to 5.0 cm. The trunk and extremities are classically involved in a bilateral distribution. GGA is normally asymptomatic but can present with pruritus. The histology shows dermal granulomatous inflammation surrounding foci of necrotic collagen and mucin. Necrobiosis lipoidica can present similarly to GGA; GGA is distinguished from necrobiosis lipoidica by its red color, the absence of an atrophic epidermis, and on histopathology: the presence of mucin and lack of plasma cells.\n\nPATHOGENESIS\n\nThe pathogenesis of GGA is incompletely understood. It is believed to involve an unknown stimulus that leads to the activation of lymphocytes through a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, ultimately initiating a proinflammatory cascade and granuloma formation (98).\n\nTREATMENT\n\nGGA has a prolonged often unresolving disease course and multiple treatments have been suggested to better manage GGA. However, much of the information stems from small studies and case reports. Antimalarials, retinoids, corticosteroids, dapsone, cyclosporine, PUVA, and calcineurin inhibitors have been suggested as therapies (98).\n\nPsoriasis\n\nPsoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder that may present with a variety of symptoms, including erythematous, indurated, and scaly areas of skin. Psoriasis has been found to be associated with a variety of risk factors, such as hypertension and metabolic syndrome, that increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. The development of diabetes mellitus, an additional cardiovascular risk factor, has been strongly associated with psoriasis (99). In particular, younger patients and those with severe psoriasis may be more likely to develop diabetes in the future (99)\n\nLichen Planus\n\nLichen planus is a mucocutaneous inflammatory disorder characterized by firm, erythematous, polygonal, pruritic, papules. These papules classically involve the wrists or ankles, although the trunk, back, and thighs can also be affected. A number of studies have cited an association between lichen planus and abnormalities in glucose tolerance testing. Approximately one in four patients with lichen planus have diabetes mellitus (100). Although the association is contested, it has been reported that patients with diabetes may also be more likely to develop oral lichen planus (101).\n\nVitiligo\n\nVitiligo is an acquired autoimmune disorder involving melanocyte destruction. Patients with vitiligo present with scattered well-demarcated areas of depigmentation that can occur anywhere on the body, but frequently involves the acral surfaces and the face. Whereas about 1% of the general population is affected by vitiligo, vitiligo is much more prevalent in those with diabetes mellitus. Vitiligo occurs more frequently in women and is also more common in type 1 than in type 2 diabetes mellitus (96,98). Coinciding vitiligo and type 1 diabetes mellitus may be associated with endocrine autoimmune abnormalities of the gastric parietal cells, adrenal, or thyroid (102). A more comprehensive review of polyglandular autoimmune disorders can be found in the Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndromes section of Endotext.\n\nHidradenitis Supparativa\n\nHidradenitis supparativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by inflamed nodules and abscesses located in intreginious areas such as the axilla or groin. These lesions are often painful and malodorous. HS is frequently complicated by sinus formation and the development of disfiguring scars. HS occurs more often in women than men and usually presents in patients beginning in their twenties (103). Compared to the general population, diabetes mellitus is three-times more common in patients with HS (104). It is recommended that patients with HS be screened for diabetes mellitus. There is no standardized approach to the treatment of HS, although some benefits have been reported with the use of antibiotics, retinoids, antiandrogens, or immunomodulators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (105).\n\nGlucagonoma\n\nGlucagonoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that most frequently affects patients in their sixth decade of life (106). Patients with glucagonoma may present with a variety of non-specific symptoms. However, necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is classically associated with glucagonoma and presents in 70% to 83% of patients (106) (107). NME is characterized by erythematous erosive crusted or vesicular eruptions of papules or plaques with irregular borders. The lesions may become bullous or blistered, and may be painful or pruritic. The abdomen, groin, genitals, or buttocks are frequently involved, a"
