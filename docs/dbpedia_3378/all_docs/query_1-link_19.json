        "text": "We assessed the relative sensitivity of EZH2-KO (EZH2-KO1 cells, unless specified) and EZH2-WT cells to an in-house curated library of 219 commercially available compounds targeting specific chromatin-modifying enzymes, cell cycle, and DNA-repair processes, including small-molecule inhibitors that are already in clinical use for the treatment of cancer (Supplementary Table S1). The majority of drugs had similar effects on cell viability in both EZH2-WT and EZH2-KO cells (Fig. 1C and D; Supplementary Table S2). However, MK8776, a CHK1 inhibitor that has been tested in early-phase clinical trials in solid tumors (18), demonstrated a significant differential reduction on cell viability in EZH2-KO cells compared with WT cells (P = 0.03 by two-tailed Student t test; Fig. 1C and D). By evaluating the dose response to MK8776, we observed that both EZH2-KO1 and EZH2-KO2 Jurkat clones had a significant reduction of the IC50 compared with EZH2-WT Jurkat cells (IC50 805 nmol/L, 825 nmol/L vs. 1,777 nmol/L, respectively, P < 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA test; Fig. 1E). Both EZH2-deficient clones displayed a consistent and similar sensitization to three structurally distinct CHK1 inhibitors, CCT245737, LY2603618, and CHIR-124, validating the specificity of this interaction (Fig. 1F–H; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Importantly, the differential reduction in cell viability on CHK1 inhibition was mediated through a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis, as confirmed by Annexin V-PI staining (84% vs. 25% Annexin V+/PI+ apoptotic cells in EZH2-deficient vs. WT Jurkat cells; Fig. 1I and J; Supplementary Fig. S2B).\n\nThe replication stress checkpoint protein kinase CHK1 has a central role in the cellular response to replication stress (RS) and is essential to prevent replication stress–induced DNA damage (19–23). We hypothesized that EZH2-KO cells might be under higher levels of replication stress with increased dependency on CHK1 function for cell survival. Replication stress is characterized by the slowing and/or stalling of replication forks. To test our hypothesis, we used the DNA fiber assay to study replication fork dynamics in EZH2-WT and EZH2-KO cells at single-molecule resolution. DNA replication tracks were labeled with the nucleotide analogue CldU (red) followed by the second analogue IdU (green; Fig. 3A). These nucleotide analogues incorporated during ongoing replication were then visualized by confocal microscopy, and the length of replication tracks (red–green track) was measured. EZH2-KO cells showed a significantly greater population of short tracks in comparison with EZH2-WT cells (Fig. 3B; 14.4 ± 4.7 vs. 19.3 ± 5.9 μm respectively, P < 0.001 by two-tailed Student t test) corresponding to a significantly reduced replication fork speed (Fig. 3B and C). Moreover, a significantly higher percentage of origin firing (green–red–green tracks) was observed in EZH2-deficient cells compared with control (Fig. 3D; P = 0.003 by two-tailed Student t test).\n\nSlowing down of replication forks causes a decoupling between the DNA polymerases and the helicase that unwinds DNA, resulting in an accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). ssDNA is bound and protected by the ssDNA-binding protein RPA, which serves as the signal for activation of the replication stress checkpoint protein kinase ATR and its downstream effector CHK1 (24–27). Activation of the replication stress checkpoint can thus be monitored by the phosphorylation levels of RPA, ATR, and CHK1, which become phosphorylated upon checkpoint activation. Consistent with previous work showing that CHK1 inhibition increases activation of replication stress markers (28, 29), CHK1 inhibition with MK8776 markedly increased phosphorylation of RPA (pRPA S33) and CHK1 at S345 (pCHK1 S345), with concomitant reduction of CHK1 autophosphorylation point at S296 (pCHK1 S296; Fig. 3E). This response was more robust in EZH2-KO cells in comparison with WT, suggesting that these cells experience elevated levels of replication stress (Fig. 3E). Acute inhibition of CHK1 in cells experiencing replication stress has been shown to cause replication fork collapse whereby replisome components dissociate from the DNA, leading to double-strand breaks and increased apoptotic death (30). In line with this, EZH2-KO cells, but not EZH2-WT cells, showed increased double-strand breaks as determined by TUNEL (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γH2AX), with cleavage of caspase-3 after exposure to MK8776 (Fig. 3E), further supporting an essential role of the replication checkpoint response for their survival.\n\nTo analyze this in finer detail, we made use of the fluorescent ubiquitination–based cell-cycle indicator system (Fucci2), based on the expression of two chimeric proteins (mCherry-hCdt1 and mVenus-hGeminin) that accumulate reciprocally in the nuclei of transduced cells during the cell cycle (32). In this system, the red fluorescence of mCherry becomes detectable in early G1 phase, the mVenus fluorescence appears in early S phase and disappears rapidly in late M phase, and during the G1–S transition both fluorophores are present (Fig. 4B). When Fucci-EZH2-WT Jurkat cells were incubated with MK8776, we observed an increased percentage of cells at G1, accompanied by a decreased percentage of cells at early S phase, indicative of G1 phase arrest. Interestingly, MK8776 did not induce this effect in EZH2-KO cells, which instead accumulated in S/G2–M (Fig. 4C and D). Importantly, we observed that upon exposure to the CHK1 inhibitor, there was a significant increase in apoptosis in Fucci-EZH2-KO cells, but not in WT cells, with Annexin V+ staining occurring in early S phase, at a time point when replication forks are first formed, and then notably in cells in S/G2–M, where we also observed increased cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 4E and F; Supplementary Fig. S5A).\n\nGiven the role of the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 in transcriptional repression, we next evaluated whether the observed phenotype in EZH2-KO cells was due to changes in gene expression. Through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of EZH2-WT, EZH2-KO1, and EZH2-KO2 Jurkat cells, we observed a marked downregulation of genes associated with T-cell differentiation (36, 37) such as RAG1, PTCRA, and LCK (Fig. 5A, left), and these changes were also observed phenotypically as indicated by downregulation of the cortical cell surface marker CD1a when analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B). Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 38) in EZH2-KO cells versus EZH2-WT control showed significant enrichment of genes upregulated in ETP-ALL as compared with more mature T-ALL cases (Supplementary Fig. S6A; ref. 1), with notable upregulation of early thymic genes such as LYL1, HHEX, KIT, and MYCN (Fig. 5A, right). When these gene-expression data were compared with those from normal thymic subtypes (37) using principal component analysis (PCA), EZH2 deficiency reflected the disparity between less-differentiated thymic subsets (Thy 1–3) as compared with more mature ones (Thy 4–6) at a global transcriptional level (principal component 2, Supplementary Fig. S6B). We hypothesized that a similar mechanism may occur in patients with T-ALL, whereby loss-of-function mutations in PRC2 are acquired at a relatively advanced thymic developmental stage, but cause reprogramming to give an ETP immunophenotype. To explore this possibility, we analyzed the V(D)J recombination status of the T-cell receptor γ (TRG) gene in a published dataset of pediatric ETP-ALL (1). Recombination of TRG occurs at the pro-T stage of T-cell development (39), such that cells that have undergone biallelic deletion at the TRG locus have matured well beyond the ETP stage to the cortical stage of thymic development (Supplementary Fig. S6C; ref. 40). Remarkably, of the 22 cases of ETP-ALL that also had loss-of-function mutations in PRC2 members, 13 (59%) had biallelic TRG deletions (1), consistent with our hypothesis (Supplementary Fig. S6D).\n\nTo ascertain whether an inverse association is observed between H3K27me3 levels and MYCN expression in patient samples, we analyzed gene-expression and mutational data from a large cohort of patients with pediatric T-ALL (3). Patients with mutations predicted to lower H3K27me3 levels had significantly higher levels of MYCN expression as compared with those with mutations predicted to lead to high H3K27me3 (7.9 vs. 1.1 FPKM, respectively; P = 0.029 by two-tailed Student t test). Furthermore, patients with low H3K27me3 had a trend toward higher MYCN expression than those patients who did not have a defined mutation in PRC2 components (“neither group,” which likely represent patients with a wide variety of H3K27me3 levels; 7.9 vs. 4.8 FPKM; P = 0.046; Fig. 5G; Supplementary Table S3). This result is supported by previous work in transgenic mice, where there is approximately 4-fold upregulation of MYCN in EZH2 KO Th CD4+ cells compared with their WT counterpart (Supplementary Fig. S6F; ref. 42).\n\nGiven that we had previously identified MYB as a key regulator of the majority of active enhancers in T-ALL cells (44), we interrogated MYB binding around the MYCN locus by ChIP-seq. Within the MYCN topologically associated domain (TAD), as defined in Jurkat cells by ChIA-PET for the cohesin subunit SMC1A (45), we noted a site of MYB occupancy +540 Kb distal to the MYCN transcriptional start site that appeared significantly enriched in EZH2-KO as compared with EZH2-WT cells (Fig. 6A), and we were able to validate differential MYB binding by ChIP-qPCR (Fig. 6B). To ascertain whether increased MYB enrichment at this site was responsible for MYCN upregulation, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to delete approximately 400 bp of this region, by targeting two guide RNAs flanking either side of the MYB binding peak (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). Although there was no significance difference in MYCN expression upon MYCN enhancer deletion in EZH2-WT clones, there was a striking downregulation of MYCN mRNA and protein levels in EZH2-KO-MYCN enhancer–deleted clones (Fig. 6C and D), confirming that this site acts as a MYCN enhancer in these cells.\n\nWe found that genetically inactivating EZH2 in T-ALL cells led to marked changes in its gene-expression pattern, with downregulation of expression of T-cell differentiation–associated genes and concomitant upregulation of ETP signature genes. This finding is in line with previous work that associates EZH2 loss with stem cell–associated transcriptional programs (57), and in correlation with the high frequency of genetic lesions in PRC2 components observed in the ETP-ALL subtype of T-ALL (1, 3). Furthermore, these results suggest that PRC2 loss-of-function mutations acquired in T-cell lineage cells of a relatively advanced thymic developmental stage may cause epigenetic deregulation leading to aberrant expression of myeloid and stem cell markers characteristic of less-differentiated subtypes. Therefore, the increased frequency of PRC2 mutations within the ETP-ALL subgroup of T-ALL might be a consequence of such epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming, explaining the observation that these phenotypically immature ALL cases have frequently undergone the types of T-cell receptor rearrangement characteristic of more differentiated T-ALL subtypes (1, 4, 58).\n\nThe px335-CRISPR-Cas9-D10A plasmid was obtained from Addgene (catalog no. 42335) and modified to express BFP or GFP by the UCL-CI Genomics and Genome Engineering Core Facility. A pair of guide RNAs (gRNA) targeting exon 2 of EZH2, obtained from the MIT CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/; gRNA #1: ACACGCTTCCGCCAACAAACTGG, quality score: 84; gRNA #2: TGCGACTGAGACAGCTCAAGAGG, quality score: 74) were each cloned into either BFP-px335 or GFP-px335, respectively. The plasmids were electroporated into Jurkat cells using AMAXA Nucleofector (Lonza), and BFP/GFP double-positive cells were single-cell–sorted by FACS (BD FACSAria Fusion, BD Biosciences) into 96-well plates and incubated under standard tissue culture conditions in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Once the clones had grown to confluency, genomic DNA was extracted using the QuickExtract DNA Extraction solution (Epicentre) following the manufacturer's instructions, and clones were screened for mutations by genomic PCR and Sanger sequencing. Briefly, PCR was performed using primers located approximately 150 bp on each side of the target site (forward: 5′- TGATTGTTAGTTTGCTGCGGA; reverse: 5′ CAGATCAAGAACCTAAGCTTCCA). The PCR product was cleaned by Qiagen spin column and sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Oligos cloned into BFP-px335, Ex2_EZH2 G1-UP: 5′-CACCGACACGCTTCCGCCAACAAAC, Ex2_EZH2 G1-DOWN: 5′-AAACGTTTGTTGGCGGAAGCGTGTC. Oligos cloned into GFP-px335, Ex2_EZH2 G2-UP: 5′- CACCGTGCGACTGAGACAGCTCAAG, Ex2_EZH2 G2-DOWN: 5′-AAACCTTGAGCTGTCTCAGTCGCAC.\n\nProtein lysates were prepared from 4 × 106 cells, in either Nuclear Extraction Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology) or prechilled RIPA buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100). Buffers were supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma; Roche). Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (NuPAGE; 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gels or NuPAGE; 3% to 8% Tris-Acetate Protein Gels; Invitrogen). Spectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder was used as a size marker. Proteins were transferred to a 0.22-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Maine Manufacturing), preactivated with 100% methanol, using the Trans–Blot SD semi-dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated overnight with a primary antibody in 2.5% BSA or milk at 4°C. Membranes were then washed in PBS-T, before probing with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody in 2.5% BSA or milk PBS-T for 1 hour. Membranes were washed and developed on X-ray film using either Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Luminata Forte Western HRP Substrate (Millipore). In some cases, membranes were stripped using Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and reprobed with another primary antibody.\n\nExponentially growing Jurkat cells were pulse labeled with 25 μmol/L CldU followed by 250 μmol/L IdU for 15 minutes each. Labeling reaction was stopped by placing cells on ice. Cells were pelleted, washed in cold PBS immediately, and resuspended in PBS at a final concentration of 1 × 106. Two microliters of cell suspension was placed on each slide and allowed to partially dry for maximum 5 minutes; afterward 7 μL of spreading buffer (200 mmol/L Tris pH 7.4; 50 mmol/L EDTA; 0.5% SDS) was added to the cells and incubated for 2 minutes, then the slides were tilted to allow the stretching of DNA fibers along the slide. After drying for 2 minutes at room temperature, slides were fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1 volume) for 10 minutes, air-dried, and either placed at 4°C for storage or treated for immunofluorescence detection. From this time onward, the slides were protected from direct light. Slides were denatured by incubation at room temperature in freshly made 2.5 mol/L HCl for maximum 1 hour 15 minutes. After repeated wash in PBS, slides were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween) for 30 minutes. Incubation with primary antibodies rat anti BrdU (AbD SeroTec; catalog no. OBT0030G), and mouse anti BrdU (Becton Dickinson; catalog no. 347580), 1:750 and 1:100 in blocking buffer, respectively, was carried out overnight at 4°C. Washes in PBS were followed by an incubation with 4% formaldehyde for 10 minutes. Slides were washed in PBS and a final wash in blocking buffer. Incubation with secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) and AlexaFluor 555–conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes), 1:500 in blocking buffer, was carried out for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed in PBS and mounted with mounting medium (Sigma; catalog no. F6182). Imaging was performed using a Leica TCS SPE microscope with a 63× objective. The lengths of CldU (AF 555, red) and IdU (AF 488, green) labeled patches were measured using the ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Origin structures (green–red–green) were quantified as a percentage of all ongoing structures (red–green).\n\nJurkat EZH2-WT, EZH2-KO1, and EZH2-KO2 RNA was extracted from 1,000,000 cells per sample using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For library preparation, samples were processed using the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kit (catalog no. KK8580) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, mRNA was isolated from total RNA using Oligo dT beads to pull down polyadenylated transcripts. The purified mRNA was fragmented using chemical hydrolysis and primed with random hexamers. Strand-specific first strand cDNA was generated using Reverse Transcriptase in the presence of Actinomycin D. The second cDNA strand was synthesized using dUTP in place of dTTP, to mark the second strand. The resultant cDNA was then “A-tailed” at the 3′ end to prevent self-ligation and adapter dimerization. Truncated adaptors containing a T-overhang were ligated to the A-Tailed cDNA. Successfully ligated cDNA molecules were then enriched with limited cycle PCR (13 cycles using 500 ng of total RNA). High-fidelity polymerase was used in the PCR to make the library strand-specific. Samples were sequenced on the NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) using a 43-bp paired end run. Run data were demultiplexed and converted to Fragments Per Kilobase of sequence per Million mapped reads (FPKM) files using Illumina's BaseSpace RNA-Seq Alignment and Cufflinks Assembly and DE applications.\n\nFor MYB ChIP-seq, a ChIPmentation protocol was adapted from ref. 66. Briefly, protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were washed with PBS/BSA 0.5% using lo-bind tubes (Eppendorf). After washing, Dynabeads were resuspended in PBS/BSA 0.5%, 2 μg of antibody added (MYB Millipore Mouse IgGak 1 μg/μL) and incubated on an orbital shaker for 2.5 hours at 4°C. 5 × 106 cells were harvested per IP and washed twice in PBS. Cells were double cross-linked in PBS with 2 mmol/L disuccinimidyl glutarate (Sigma, catalog no. 80424) for 45 minutes, with the addition of formaldehyde to 1% w/v final for the final 15 minutes. Cross-linking was quenched with glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 mol/L. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS plus 1× complete proteinase inhibitor (Sigma, catalog no. 11836145001) and 5 mmol/L sodium butyrate (Sigma, catalog no. B5887) and resuspended in 100 μL sonication buffer (Tris pH 8.0 10 mmol/L, NaCl 100 mmol/L, EDTA 1 mmol/L, EGTA 0.5 mmol/L, sodium deoxycholate 0.1%, 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, plus proteinase inhibitors and butyrate). Cells were sonicated in a Diagenode Bioruptor Pico using lo-bind tubes (Eppendorf). Sonicated material was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4°C for 10 minutes and supernatants transferred to a fresh tube. Two percent of the sonicated chromatin was removed for input controls. The samples were incubated at 65°C overnight in elution buffer (Tris pH 8.0 50 mmol/L, EDTA 10 mmol/L, SDS 1%) with the addition of proteinase K (20 μg/μL) and acidified with 10 μL 3 mol/L sodium acetate prior to purification over a MinElute column (Qiagen). Sonication efficiency was assessed by 2% agarose gel and eluted DNA quantified by Qubit (Invitrogen). The antibody-Dynabead conjugates were washed three times in PBS/BSA. The remainder of the sonicated chromatin was adjusted to a volume of 100 μL, 10 μL of 10% Triton X-100 was added, and then 10 μL of washed beads were added per IP. The chromatin-bead mix was incubated overnight at 4°C on an orbital shaker. The following day, the antibody-bead-chromatin mix was washed three times in wash buffer (Hepes pH 7.6, EDTA 1 mmol/L, LiCl 0.5 mol/L sodium deoxycholate 0.7%, NP-40 1%), followed by 2 washes in 10 mmol/L Tris pH 8.0 before resuspension in 25 μL of tagmentation reaction mix [10 mmol/L Tris pH 8.0, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 μL Nextera tagmentation enzyme (Illumina, catalog no. FC-121-1030)]. Chromatin was tagmented for 10 minutes at 37°C in a thermocycler, and reaction was stopped by addition of ChIP dilution buffer (Tris pH 8.0 10 mmol/L, NaCl 100 mmol/L, EDTA 1 mmol/L, EGTA 0.5 mmol/L, sodium deoxycholate 0.1%, N-lauryl-sarcosine 0.5%, SDS 0.1%), followed by two further washes in ChIP dilution buffer. Beads were then washed twice with low-salt TE (Tris pH 8.0 10 mmol/L, EDTA 1 mmol/L, NaCl 50 mmol/L) before de–cross-linking in 48 μL elution buffer supplemented with 2 μL proteinase K (20 μg/μL) incubation at 55°C for 1 hour and 65°C overnight. All buffers prior to this were supplemented by proteinase inhibitor and sodium butyrate as above.\n\nThe next day, beads were magnetized, and supernatants were saved to fresh lo-bind tubes. The remaining beads were further digested in 19 μL elution buffer with 1 μL proteinase K (20 μg/μL) at 55°C for 1 hour. The supernatants were pooled, acidified with sodium acetate, and purified over a MinElute column (Qiagen) into 22 μL Qiagen elution buffer EB. Two microliters of each IP was test-amplified by real-time qPCR in a 10 μL reaction [2× KAPA HiFi ready mix (preheated to 98°C for 30 seconds), primer Ad1-Ad2.1 each to final concentration of 0.75 μmol/L, 1:10,000 dilution of SYBR dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. S7563)] using the following program (72°C 5 minutes, 98°C 30 seconds; 25 cycles of 98°C 10 seconds, 63°C 30 seconds, 72°C 30 seconds; 72°C 1 minute). Fluorescence was plotted using a linear scale against cycle number, and the number of cycles that resulted in 50% total amplification chosen for amplification of the bulk ChIP DNA. The remaining DNA was amplified in the following conditions [25 μL KAPA HiFi 2× master mix (preactivated), 20 μL ChIP DNA, Nextera primer Ad1/Ad2.x at 0.75 μmol/L, were Ad2 primers were indexed per sample in a 50 μL reaction volume] and cycled as above to the number of cycles judged from the above qPCR. Input controls were tagmented in the following conditions [2.5 ng input DNA, 1 μL tagmentation enzyme, 1 μL 5× tagmentation buffer (Tris pH 8.0 50 mmol/L, MgCl2 25 mmol/L) in a total volume of 5 μL at 55°C for 5 minutes]. Tagmentation was stopped by the addition of 1 μL 0.6% SDS at room temperature for 5 minutes. Inputs were amplified in the following conditions [25 μL KAPA HiFi 2× master mix (preactivated), 1.5 μL Ad1 primer, 1.5 μL Ad2.x index primer, 25 μL, 6 μL tagmented DNA in a 50 μL reaction] for 12 cycles as above. The resulting PCR products were purified using 90 μL magnetic SPRI beads (Agencourt AMPure XP Beckman Coulter, catalog no. A63881) and after two 80% ethanol washes were resuspended in 50 μL water. Size separation was performed by incubation with 32.5 μL SPRI beads, transfer of supernatant to a new tube, and then addition of 12.5 μL fresh SPRI beads. Following two further 80% ethanol washes, the size-selected libraries were eluted into 15 μL water. Libraries were checked and quantified by Qubit (Invitrogen) and Tapestation (Agilent). Normalized libraries were pooled and sequenced using a NextSeq (Illumina) 75 bp paired end short read sequencer using standard protocols.\n\nTo delete the putative MYCN enhancer in EZH2-WT and EZH2-KO1 Jurkat cells, the Alt-R CRISPR RNP system from IDT was used, which is comprised of three components: crRNA, tracrRNA, Cas9. We used the crRNA:tracrRNA duplex, in which crRNA must be used in conjunction with tracrRNA to form a functional gRNA duplex. In the crRNA:tracrRNA duplex, tracrRNA serves as a universal 67mer tracrRNA that is attached to a fluorophore-ATTO550, whereas the crRNA provides sequence specificity against the target gene. We designed two gRNAs (crRNA) flanking the observed MYB peak (Chr2: 16,438,737-16,439,346; hg19) using MIT CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/; Guide #1: GGCTTTGCTCAATGTGGTAC; Guide #2: TAATCCCCAAAAACTCCATC). The crRNAs were incubated with tracrRNA at 95°C for 5 minutes to form a duplex. This was subsequently incubated with recombinant Cas9 protein at room temperature for 20 minutes to form the RNP complex. The RNP complex was then delivered to Jurkat EZH2-KO cells by electroporation using AMAXA nucleofector I (Lonza). Following electroporation, cells were recovered in 2 mL prewarmed RPMI complete medium and were incubated at 37°C overnight. The following day, electroporated cells were single-cell sorted into 96-well plates using BD FACS Aria Fusion flow cytometer. The electroporation efficiency was determined by the percentage of ATTO 550–positive cells, which was about 80%. Ninety-six–well plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 weeks to allow formation of colonies. Genomic DNA from clones was extracted using Quick DNA extract solution (Epicentre), and PCR screening was performed to amplify across the gRNA break sites (primer pairs used forward: 5′- GAAGTGGTTTCCCCACCACA; reverse: 5′-TAGCCCTAGTTGAAGCC CCA) products were run on 1.5% agarose gel. The expected PCR product size was 604 bp in Jurkat parental lines with intact MYCN enhancer. The CRISPR/Cas9–induced excision of the enhancer was expected to result in a 144 bp PCR product. Sanger sequencing of the PCR products of EZH2-KO-MYCNenh-mut2 showed the upper band (∼604 bp) contained an inversion of the WT sequence, resulting in a compound heterozygous clone.\n\nFor the PDX in vivo model, ETP-ALL-13 cells harvested from the spleen of an engrafted mouse were transduced to stably express firefly luciferase and engrafted back in female NSG mice by intravenous injection of 4 × 106 cells. Eight weeks postinjection, luciferase-expressing ETP-ALL-13 cells (ETP-ALL-13-Luciferized-mCherry+) were harvested from the spleen of a mouse and sorted by flow cytometry to ensure a homogeneous population expressing luciferase was obtained. ETP-ALL-13-Luciferized cells were then expanded in two NSG female mice before using them to test CCT245737. For in vivo administration of CCT245737 in this model, female NSG mice were intravenously injected with approximately 0.4 × 106 ETP-ALL-13–luciferized cells. Four weeks postinjection, engraftment was confirmed by BLI (as described above) and 200 mg/kg CCT245737, prepared in DMSO and diluted 1:10 into prefiltered PTW before dosing, was administered for 10 days by oral gavage (5 consecutive days per week, for 2 weeks). Control mice received a similar volume of vehicle."
