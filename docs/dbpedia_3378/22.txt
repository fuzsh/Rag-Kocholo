The MCC won the toss and elected to bat first, reaching a respectful 216-8 off their allotted 50 overs.

Arfan Akram top-scored with 45, while Adam Soilleux made 36 and Johnny Charles carried his bat for an unbeaten 30.

Slough bowled with discipline on a pitch that suited spin with N. Aslam taking 3-30 and A. Mohammed 3-33.

The home side started their chase positively and had 71 runs on the board before losing the second wicket.

However, man-of-the-match Charles then bowled an excellent spell to take 4-27 and Slough were eventually all out for 166 runs.

MCC match manager and captain Arfan Akram said: “The ECB earlier this summer launched the South Asian Action Plan to ensure cricket in accessible for everyone with an integrated approach.

“The MCC has embraced the initiative by incorporating the fixtures to their out-match programme, which already consists of over 500 games.

“I was delighted with all the conversations between players, officials, guests and spectators who all appreciated the support MCC are providing to ensure cricket is a game for everyone.”
