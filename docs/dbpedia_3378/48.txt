Adam Soilleux’s side trail leaders Colchester & East Essex by two points and will have high hopes of success against their struggling hosts.

Kellon Carmichael took a brace of wickets and plundered 78 runs against Woodford Wells last Saturday as Hadleigh secured a six-wicket win.

And Soilleux is hoping that victory will provide a platform for a win which would keep the pressure up on Colchester, who were relegated from the Premier Division last summer and host eighth-placed Hainault & Clayhall this afternoon.

Fifth-placed Southend & EMT welcome Harlow to Southchurch Park and will be looking for a win to close the nine-point gap on fourth-placed Hutton.

The Seasiders lost ground last weekend when their match against Colchester at Castle Park was abandoned due to rain with the visitors on 55-4 chasing 269.

Wickford defeated Southend’s visitors Harlow by eight-wickets on Saturday in a rain-hit match.

The win left Wickford in seventh, although they face a stern test today when third-placed Buckhurst Hill visit the Patmore Memorial Ground.

Hill go into the match on the back of an eight-wicket triumph over fourth-placed Hutton, but Wickford will be hoping Tinotenda Mawoyo can maintain his form with the bat following his 109 against Harlow.
