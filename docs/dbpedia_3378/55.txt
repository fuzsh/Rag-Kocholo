A couple of old boys – and one old opponent – are at Weetwood today as Leeds Bradford play hosts to a MCC XI in a 50 over game.

Andrew Rennison (2006/7) and former captain Will Vanderspar (2012-2014) are pictured below in younger, more carefree pre-graduate days!!

Ex Loughborough players Adam Soilleux is also representing the visitors. Good to see them all back on another cracking day of sunshine!!
