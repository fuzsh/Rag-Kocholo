HOUSTON (AP) - The Houston Rockets sent Shane Battier to Memphis Thursday in a deal for center Hasheem Thabeet to Houston, according to a person familiar with the specifics of the trades.

The Rockets also recieved a first round draft pick, and sent Ish Smith to the Grizzlies.

Battier, 32, is valued as much for his play and leadership as for his contract. He's to make about $7.4 million this season.

Memphis originally selected Battier with the sixth overall pick in the 2001 draft. He played five seasons in Memphis, helping the Grizzlies to three playoff appearances, before he was traded to the Rockets in July 2006 for Stromile Swift and the draft rights to Rudy Gay.
