From his childhood, Battier stood out as an outlier. He entered Country Day as a seventh-grader\n\nFurthermore, he attended Duke, playing four years under coach Mike Krzyzewski and frequently proving to be the best defender on the court.\n\nAfter the NBA drafted him in 2001, he played for teams such as the Memphis Grizzlies, Houston Rockets, and Miami Heat before retiring in 2014.\n\nAdditionally, he worked for ESPN and recently became a board member of Yext, an online marketing company.\n\nOn December 1, 2021, an announcement revealed that Battier and former NBA players had joined an investing group to launch the East Asia Super League.\n\nWho Is The Wife Of Shane Battier? Age And Wikipedia\n\nShane Battier is a married man. He has been wed to his high school sweetheart, Heidi Ufer, for almost two decades, and has been together for three decades.\n\nAccording to some sources, Heidi Ufer and Shane Battier dated for 10 years, starting in 1994, before they exchanged vows in the summer of 2004.\n\nOn June 2, 2008, they welcomed their first son, Zeke Edward Battier. Their second child, a daughter named Eloise, was born on April 17, 2011.\n\nHeidi, believed to be the same age as her husband, is American by nationality. Additionally, she is the biggest supporter of her husbandâs work.\n\nIn 2010, she and her husband Shane established an organization called âThe Battier Take Charge Foundation.â\n\nThe Battier Take Charge Foundation aims to provide resources for developing and educating under-served youth.\n\nMoreover, their foundation has awarded nearly $3 million dollars in college scholarships and programming.\n\nDid The Former Player Run For Public Office?\n\nAlmost a decade ago, Shane Battier, one of the smartest players in the NBA, was allegedly in the running for a US Senate seat.\n\nIn 2014, Zach Lowe published a report on Grantland stating that Shane Battier claimed the Michigan Democratic Party had contacted him to inquire if he would consider running for a US Senate seat.\n\nMoreover, the offer was to replace longtime US Senator Carl Levin.\n\nHe announced his retirement in 2013. Then, multiple sources mentioned Battier as a potential candidate.\n\nHowever, the two-time NBA champion declined and chose not to run for office.\n\nAlthough the news of Shane Battier rejecting an offer to run for office was significant at the time, many members of the Democratic Party believe that no such offer was made in the first place.\n\nAccording to Josh Pugh, Communications Director for the Michigan Democratic Party, Battier was not even considered a potential candidate.\n\nAdditionally, he said, âLike many fans of basketball and politics, we at the Michigan Democratic Party were surprised to hear Shane Battier mentioned for the first time this afternoon as a possible candidate for US Senate.â\n\nThe issue sparked debate as many believed such an offer was possible, albeit unlikely.\n\nncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC0xKKbomWlm7KzedKhmKedXZeutcDInqlmr5mbsm6txp5kmq%2BZoLaxscOimGg%3D"
