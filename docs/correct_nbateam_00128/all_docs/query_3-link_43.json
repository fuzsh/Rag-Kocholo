During the LG “Beyond the Arc” event and through the remainder of the tournament, LG will donate $3 each time #LGTrivia is used, with the goal of raising $20,000 for The Battier Take Charge Foundation’s scholarship program, which awards four-year college scholarships to deserving young leaders from the greater Miami, Houston and Detroit areas.\n\nFans who wish to participate and help drive donations using #LGTrivia can go to the new LG NCAA fan engagement Web site, www.LGGameDayHub.com, try their hand at online trivia games and tweet their results.

The new site is a place for all things NCAA and features a variety of games, contests and sweepstakes, plus information about LG products that help fans do game day right.\n\n“LG and I share a passion for inspiring and empowering others, whether that’s through innovative technology or educational opportunities,” said Battier, co-founder of The Battier Take Charge Foundation and former Duke University and NBA standout. “I’m thrilled to join forces with LG to launch a social campaign that embodies the game day spirit by bringing people together to support a common cause.”\n\n“LG’s ‘Do Game Day Right’ initiative is aimed at rallying passionate fans for the ultimate game day experience with the help of LG’s innovative products.
