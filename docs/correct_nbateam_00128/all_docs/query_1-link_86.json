        "text": "As is usually the case, the lure of Miami was too strong for a prominent NBA free agent to pass up.\n\n[Follow Ball Don’t Lie on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr]\n\nInstead of nailing a free agent player signing this time, the Heat have lured in a formidable ex-player: Shane Battier, who chose the Heat in 2011 during his final major free agent turn, has joined the team’s front office, the club revealed on Thursday:\n\nAccording to a statement, Battier’s “duties will include the development of analytics in evaluating all talent, including college, free agents and current Miami players.” In the same statement, the 38-year old said that he is “thrilled to be joining the front office” of the franchise he won titles with in 2012 and 2013.\n\n[ | Mock Draft | The Vertical | Latest news]\n\nKnown as a cerebral on-court contributor, Battier’s acknowledged gifts as a heady forward tend to overshadow the fact that he was a celebrated prep and college star at Duke (he also likes quoting Jimmy Buffett, so let’s get all the gnarly stuff out of the way) prior to working his way toward acting as the No. 4 pick in the 2001 draft.\n\nTaken by a Vancouver Grizzlies team that was about to move to Memphis, Battier established himself as a successful two-way player, but as he approached his prime years (faster than most of his contemporaries from the preps-to-pros heavy 2001 draft) it became clearer and clearer that Battier was best served as a top of the line role player for a group featuring several stars.\n\nThe first of those teams to glom onto the idea in practice was the Houston Rockets, which dealt lottery pick Rudy Gay for Battier in 2006 during the first season that general manager Daryl Morey ran the team. Battier flourished with the Rockets, in spite of the team’s ongoing injury woes to stars Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady, earning a reputation that was artfully characterized by author Michael Lewis in his 2009 New York Times piece, “The No-Stats All-Star.”\n\nRead an excerpt:\n\nIt would seem that pairing with Morey in Houston would be ideal for Battier, who was honored by the Rockets for his work with the team earlier in February. From that night’s event, as documented by the Houston Chronicle:\n\nAlas, despite a house full of Texans, Battier chose the Heat yet again.\n\nWe suspect that he’ll do exceedingly well in Miami, as we thank Shane Battier for deigning to delight us with his presence in the NBA family, as opposed to chasing down pursuits far nobler than sizing up the No. 12 pick in this year’s NBA draft.\n\n– – – – – – –"
