        "text": "Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey and Shane Battier had a duet for the ages on Thursday. At the retired forward's Battioke charity event in Houston, the two of them teamed up for a rendition of \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked.\" They were in costume, too -- Battier was the Wicked Witch of the West and Morey was the Good Witch of the South.\n\nNaturally, they altered the lyrics so Morey was begging Battier to join the Rockets front office in song. There were also jokes about Hasheem Thabeet, DeAndre Jordan and Joey Crawford. Here's the whole thing, via the Houston Chronicle:\n\nBefore the performance, Battier tweeted that they were doing a dress rehearsal and had \"taken it too far this year.\" I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not that was the case.\n\nBoth of them were pleased with how it went in the end. It's so rare you hear the phrase \"holy majoly,\" but this performance demanded it:\n\nRockets forward Donatas Motiejunas was in attendance and said they made his day. I doubt anyone who was there will forget it."
