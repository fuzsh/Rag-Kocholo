        "text": "Shane Battier has plans for retirement with Miami Heat\n\nMIAMI â€” As his time winds down with the Miami Heat, forward Shane Battier has started to think about his future.\n\nHe has one year and $3,270,000 left on his contract. After his current deal expires, he would have played 13 seasons. And, there's a strong possibility the 34-year-old will retire from the NBA.\n\n\"I think I have one more year,\" Battier told USA TODAY Sports. \"My contract is up next year, and I'll reassess where I am, but we'll see. It's a good possibility, a good possibility. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, and everything in this league is negotiable, but at that point I'll be 36 and it may be time to do something else.\"\n\nBefore joining the Heat in 2011, Battier played for the Houston Rockets and Memphis Grizzlies. He has averaged 9.0 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 1.0 blocks over 904 games.\n\nWhen asked how he wants to be remembered when his career does come to an end, Battier responded, \"As a guy who won games and did it the right way.\"\n\nThe former Duke star has been to the playoffs in nine of his 12 seasons in the NBA. He won his first NBA championship with Miami last season, to go with his title at Duke in 2001.\n\nHe became one of the team's veteran leaders with his ability to knock down three-point shots that helped the Heat during their postseason run.\n\n\"I play to win, obviously, but I don't play for the ring, if that makes sense,\" Battier said. \"I play to maximize my career and maximize my opportunities. If that leads to the mountaintop then it leads to the mountaintop, like it did last year.\""
