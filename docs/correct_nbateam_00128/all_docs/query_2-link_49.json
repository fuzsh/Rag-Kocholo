        "text": "James Schmidt@ @james_schmidt1Correspondent I\n\nRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nThe Rockets traded away Shane Battier to Memphis in a deal that brought Hasheem Thabeet and a 2013 lottery-protected pick.\n\nExamining this deal you think: OK, so they got a huge draft bust and a 2013 first-rounder and they probably got worse because Battier was their best defender.\n\nBut could they have actually gotten better dumping their (and one of the league's) best defenders?\n\nFirst, let's go over a couple of reasons why they didn't get better:\n\nLeadership: Battier was the guy everybody looked up to in the locker room. One of them most respected and well-spoken players in the league, everybody looked up to him for inspiration or if they needed some help with an aspect of the game.\n\nHard Work: Battier was constantly watching game tape and doing whatever he could to prepare himself for his challenge the next game.\n\nDefense: Battier has the reputation for being one of the best defenders in the league and almost propelled the Rockets to defeating the Lakers in a seven-game playoff series by shutting down Kobe and making him almost toxic to his team some nights.\n\nHow could they have possibly gotten any better by trading that away for a bust and a draft pick? Let's take a look.\n\nChase Budinger: Chase was drafted in the second round of the 2009 draft and had a great rookie season, averaging nine points per game. He is averaging 15.6 points per game since the trade and is shooting with great efficiency from three-point land. He has really added another dimension to the Rockets' already powerful offense, something Battier couldn't do.\n\nTerrence Williams: Terrence was selected eighth overall in the 2009 draft and was traded to the Rockets for a first-round draft pick. He has gotten almost no playing time since coming to Houston and upset Rockets fans have started using the hashtag #FreeTwill on Twitter. He is a skilled defender and is an athletic freak who can create off the dribble and is an excellent passer and rebounder. He's like a poor man's Andre Iguodala.\n\nSo, did the Rockets get better?\n\nThey've only played five games since the deadline, so you can't really tell. But so far, it looks like it.\n\nYou can vote and tell me what you think and comment down below as well.\n\nEmail me at jameschmidt1@gmail.com\n\nYou can also follow me on twitter at http://twitter.com/#!/James_Schmidt1"
