        "text": "Our Athlete’s Voice series gives athletes a forum to talk about how technology has impacted their careers and their lives away from sports. This week, retired two-time NBA champion, and the Miami Heat’s current director of basketball development and analytics, Shane Battier talked about the first days of the NBA’s analytics movement, his investments in sports technology and the importance of youth sports.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAfter the publication of Michael Lewis’s book Moneyball in 2003, MLB was brimming with new data-driven theories about baseball. But the rest of the sports world was much slower to catch up. If there was a singular introduction of basketball to analytics, that too came from the pen of Lewis, in a 2009 New York Times Magazine story headlined “The No-Stats All-Star.”\n\nThe subject of Lewis’s feature was Houston Rockets small forward Shane Battier, a defensive specialist. Battier never made an actual NBA All-Star Game but, as the story explained, had made essential contributions to his team, albeit in ways that until then had not been properly quantified. A few months later, Sports Illustrated’s Chris Ballard also profiled Battier, this time in the context of his success slowing Lakers star Kobe Bryant. The secret was out.\n\nBattier graduated from Duke as the winningest player in men’s college basketball history with 131 wins in his four seasons from 1997 through 2001, including two Final Four trips and one national championship. (Gonzaga’s Przemek Karnowski overtook Battier in 2017, finishing his career with 137.) The Vancouver Grizzlies picked Battier No. 6 overall in the 2001 NBA draft, and the 6’8” player went on to play 13 years in the league, notching two NBA titles with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAfter retiring in 2014, Battier spent a year as an ESPN commentator and then began exploring sports technology with investments in LeagueApps and SeatGeek. In February 2017, he rejoined the Heat as director of basketball development and analytics. Though Battier declined to talk specifics about his current role, he did explain why he came back. “When I retired, I missed the juice of being part of a team and trying to vie for a championship.”\n\nOn being the poster child for basketball analytics…\n\n\"At the time, I didn’t have a great appreciation for it as much because I was just doing what I did my entire career. The same things I was doing in high school, I was doing in the NBA—just trying to make the coach play me and keep me on the floor. After going to Houston and learning a different way of looking at the game, thankfully, I rated up high in a lot of the new models, and it made me appreciate the different way in which you can look at sports and basketball. So it was fun. I like looking at old problems in new ways.”\n\nOn how data influenced his game …\n\n“I don’t know how other teams do it today, but I know when I dealt with Sam [Hinkie] and Daryl [Morey], I was always looking for an edge. I was always looking [for] every little edge that I could gain on the basketball court. I saw the data as just another way to gain an advantage over my opponent. Just like having a better jump shot or maybe working harder in the weight room, it was a tool. The dirty joke is that players will do anything they can within legal bounds to give themselves a chance to win a game, be a better player, get the next contract. So, for me, working with Sam and Daryl made all the sense in the world. Why wouldn’t I use this to my advantage?\n\n“[But] to be honest, I didn’t want any of my metrics. As much as I wanted every little piece of data and weakness on my opponent, I wanted to know nothing about what I did because I was so neurotic that I would have obsessed about my weak points. I probably would have been a better player if I looked at my weaknesses, looking back at it.\n\n“But it changed the way I played because I knew what was really bad for the offensive guy I was defending, so I did the opposite on offense. I never would shoot two-point jumpers. I think, my last two years, I shot four or five two-point jumpers because it was a bad shot. Consciously, as much as it helped me on the defensive end, I thought it really sapped my creativity on the offensive end, which was a trade-off I was willing to make.\n\n“We’re in the winning business. As much as we’re in the aesthetics business, we’re in the winning business. Anything we can do to get closer to that victory, we’re going to do. Maybe aesthetics be damned. If I could go back, I would probably still do it the same way—maybe shoot more threes. I talked to my shooting coach who I worked with growing up and said, ‘If we could go back, I don’t think I would ever have shot a two-point jumper. Ever. Ever, ever, ever.’ I’d try to take 15 threes a game.”\n\nOn investing in sports technology …\n\n“I met [LeagueApps president Jeremy Goldberg] through the tech boondoggles that I was on after I retired. I’ve always been very passionate about youth sports. They played such a huge part in my development and, still to this day, the lessons I learned were instrumental in me being here today. When he talked about how to influence youth sports and bring some organization and some clarity and improve the youth sports experience, I said, ‘Let me know how I can help.’ It’s an amazing platform.\n\n“I went through a phase where I was vetting a lot of companies and trying to get in on the angel level. Whether it was SeatGeek or LeagueApps, they were fun projects. I like the people that are running the ship, so to speak, and I tend to bet on the jockey as much as I do the horse. That’s certainly the case with Jeremy and [CEO Brian Litvack] at LeagueApps.”\n\nOn finding his place in sports …\n\n“I learned what I needed to learn and the most important lessons about sports and being a part of a team when I was in kindergarten and when I was in first grade. I was a foot taller than everybody else. I was mixed—my dad’s black, my mom’s white. And I was poor. I lived on the poor side of town. So I always stuck out. I never fit in. I was always different. But there was one place where I always fit in and that was on the kickball court at recess, the basketball court, the sandlot. I realized at an early age, when I help my friends win, they love me. They want me on their team. They want me around. Kindergarten for me wasn’t like, ‘Let’s go play fun games like kickball.’ It was like, ‘win or die.’ It was a matter of social survival for me. And that was my mentality my entire career.\n\n“I wasn’t the most talented guy but, from kindergarten to my last day in the NBA, I don’t think you’ll ever find a teammate that I played [with who won’t say], ‘You know what, Shane was never about himself. He was always about what it took for the team to win.’ ”\n\nOn encouraging youth athletes ...\n\n“[Today] 70% of kids retire from sports by the age of 13. That’s a travesty. 70%! Of those 70%, you know what the worst part of the sports experience was for them? The ride home. The ride home! Doesn’t that break your heart?\n\n“I heard a great talk from famed sports psychologist Bob Rotella, who said, ‘You know what the best thing to say to your kids after a game is? The best thing you can say to your kids is nothing.’ If they want to talk about it, they will. And if they do, they’ve given you permission to give feedback and coaching and tell them all the wonderful things that they did. But, until then, shut it.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nNew Athlete’s Voice stories appear earlier in our newsletter, which you cansubscribe to here.\n\nRead more in our ongoingAthlete’s Voice series …\n\nWheelchair Racer Daniel Romanchuk: Technology Can Make a Huge Impact on Inclusion in Sports\n\nNBA Player Anthony Tolliver: ‘Peer-to-Peer Companies Are the New Wave.
