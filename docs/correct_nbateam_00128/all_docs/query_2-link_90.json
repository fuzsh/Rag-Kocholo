        "text": "Video courtesy Florida Sun-Sentinel\n\nShane Battier is perhaps the most statistically inclined player in the NBA. When he joined the Miami Heat this season, Battier tried with minimal success to spread the gospel to new teammates LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, who are two of the league’s most gifted athletes.\n\n“They’ve never asked me for sabermetric analysis,” Battier said before Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals last night. “I’ve offered it a few times. I don’t know how they’ve taken it. It’s sort of like handing Michelangelo a different type of brush and saying, ‘Hey, try this while you’re painting the Sistine Chapel.’â€‰”\n\nJames respects Battier’s dedication to statistics, even if he hasn’t adopted the methods.\n\n“He prepares with a unique style,” James said. “He’s his own guy so there’s nothing I’ve really stolen from him. But you know how in-tuned he is and how smart he is, and his basketball IQ definitely shows. I don’t break it down as thoroughly as he does, but he definitely helps us out on the floor.”\n\nBattier, a Duke graduate, wasn’t always a slave to numbers. The 33-year-old had an epiphany when he was traded to the Houston Rockets before his sixth season.\n\nLearning from Houston general manager Daryl Morey and vice president of basketball operations Sam Hinkie, Battier became devoted to their approach to the game.\n\n“They’re on the cutting edge of sort of the sabermetric analytics of the NBA,” Battier said. “I really learned a lot from them. The way I think about the game is totally different than how I used to. It just makes sense. I think I’m a logical guy and every player has strengths and weaknesses. If you quantify that, you have a better understanding of what actually wins and what loses and you take a lot of the emotion out of the game.”\n\nIn his first week in Miami, Battier examined his new team’s scouting report. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra is known for his meticulous preparation and his reliance on statistics, but the report was nowhere near detailed enough for Battier.\n\n“It’s not like we’re not detail-oriented, going all the way back to (former Heat coaches) Pat (Riley) and Stan (Van Gundy). In most circles, people thought we were over the top,” Spoelstra said. “(Battier) said, ‘No, this is not good enough. I need something else.’ That kind of floored us.”\n\nVideo courtesy Florida Sun-Sentinel\n\nSpoelstra said the team has two scouting reports, one for players and one for the coaching staff.\n\n“Shane can digest information equivalent to an assistant coach, which is remarkable,” Spoelstra said.\n\nBattier arrived with a notebook full of numbers and thoughts he’s compiled throughout his career. There have been some growing pains adjusting to the Heat’s way of doing things, but things have smoothed out.\n\n“They’re not as numbers-oriented as Houston was from a personnel standpoint,” Battier said. “They look at certain numbers — not the numbers I’m used to, so I’ve had to work with them. We’ve had to find a middle ground here. That’s my goal in the offseason: to find a better level for all of us.”"
