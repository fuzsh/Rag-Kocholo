        "text": "Miami Heat forward Shane Battier played only 6:11 in Game 1, which was 6:11 more than he played in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals against Indiana.\n\nBattier's playing time has been steadily declining for the last two weeks. The Pacers' big lineups were partly to blame last series, but a shooting slump certainly isn't helping his case, either. Battier went 0 for 3 - all of them 3-pointers - against the Spurs on Thursday night and has made just 2 of his last 19 shots in the postseason.\n\nBattier is shooting 21.9 percent in the playoffs and hasn't cracked double digit minutes since Game 4 against Indiana.\n\n\"I'm at a point now where it's not about percentages. I could make every shot from here on out and my percentage is still going to be bunk,\" Battier said with his trademark sense of humor. \"So I'm past percentages. That's the good news. I'm buying low on myself at this point. I'm buying low. And if I'm worthless after this series, that's life.\"\n\nBattier said that it's his job to give Heat coach Erik Spoelstra \"nightmares and make him stay up at night and say, 'How can I sit Shane?' That's my task. That's it. Make his life miserable by playing well. Everything else, that's on him.\"\n\nThat can be hard to do when you're playing just six minutes a night.\n\n\"Everyone wants to harp on the shooting. The shooting's only been a sliver of what I do,\" he said. \"I haven't lasted this long in the NBA by only being a shotmaker. I impact the games in different ways, and that's what I need to do.\"\n\nFlop study\n\nDallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is taking on flopping, and one of his companies is putting up more than $100,000 to study the problem.\n\nResearchers at Southern Methodist University say that Radical Hoops Ltd., a Cuban-owned company, has awarded a grant to fund an 18-month \"scientific study of the unsavory practice of player flopping in basketball and other sports.\"\n\n\"The issues of collisional forces, balance and control in these types of athletic settings are largely uninvestigated,\" said SMU biomechanics expert Peter G. Weyand, who leads the research team. \"There has been a lot of research into balance and falls in the elderly, but relatively little on active adults and athletes.\"\n\nResearchers will investigate the forces involved in typical basketball collisions and look at how much force is required to cause a legitimate loss of balance, among other flopping-related matters.\n\nThe NBA has been fining players who are deemed guilty of flopping in order to try and trick an official into making a certain call, and the matter will be discussed more next week when the league's competition committee meets.\n\nEtc."
