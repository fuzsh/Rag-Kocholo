        "text": "Shane Battier was recruited by the Spurs and Thunder last offseason, with the Spurs envisioning him as a “stretch four,” which is the position he’s playing with Chris Bosh out. That doesn’t mean he’s watching their series. “I haven’t watched San Antonio, other than one time we played them,” Battier said.\n\nIn a pregame media availability on Friday, Cheryl Miller ripped the league’s record new broadcast rights package and the negotiators who put it together. Miller called for a number four-times higher than the reported $2.2 billion over 11 years that the WNBA reportedly will receive starting in 2025. The new deal could be as much as six-times higher than the current deal struck in 2016. “I’m not great with numbers,” Miller told reporters in Phoenix. “That’s a lowball.”"
