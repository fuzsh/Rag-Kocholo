        "text": "Shane Battier will be 36 years old by the time his current contract with the Miami Heat expires after the 2013-14 season, but he's already thinking about the end of his career. Battier told USA Today that there's a likely shot he hangs up his court shoes after next season.\n\n\"I think I have one more year,\" Battier told USA TODAY Sports. \"My contract is up next year, and I'll reassess where I am, but we'll see. It's a good possibility, a good possibility. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, and everything in this league is negotiable, but at that point I'll be 36 and it may be time to do something else.\"\n\nMore coverage available at our Heat blog, Hot Hot Hoops\n\nAveraging 9.0 points and 4.4 rebounds over a 12-year NBA career, Battier played for the Memphis Grizzlies and Houston Rockets before joining the Heat last season.\n\nThe Grizzlies selected Battier sixth overall in 2001 and in his rookie season he put up his best statistical numbers of his career, averaging 14.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.8 assists while playing nearly 40 minutes per game. As Battier matured, he filled in as a role player especially known for his defense and hustle.\n\nAfter winning a title during his first year in Miami in 2012, Battier was successful as an undersized power forward where he helped the Heat with his 43 percent three-point accuracy this season.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• Tony Parker's miracle shot saves Spurs | GIF: So close!\n\n• How the Spurs beat the traps\n\n• Rodman: LeBron would have been average in 80s&90s\n\n• George Karl's legacy in Denver\n\n• NBA mock draft: Let's collaborate! | Scouting reports | Big Board"
