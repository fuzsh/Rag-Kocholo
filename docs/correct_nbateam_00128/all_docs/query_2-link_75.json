        "text": "AFTER thirteen years in the NBA, a two-time champion has found success in the world of business.\n\nNow 45 years old, Shane Battier recently embarked on a new challenge, appearing on Celebrity Jeopardy!\n\nOriginally from Michigan, Battier enjoyed a hugely decorated collegiate career at Duke.\n\nAn NCAA National Champion in 2001, the 6-foot-8 guard/forward was also named the tournament's MVP and the National College Player of the Year that same season.\n\nA two-time First-Team All-ACC selection, Battier was drafted sixth overall by the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, ahead of future All-Stars such as Gilbert Arenas, Zach Randolph, and Tony Parker.\n\nHe proved an instant hit, being named an NBA All-Rookie First-Teamer after starting all 78 of his appearances that season.\n\nOver the course of the next four seasons, Battier would start 201 of his 318 appearances for the Grizzlies.\n\nDealt to the Houston Rockets in 2006, he would go on to be named an All-Defensive Second-Teamer twice during his tenure in Texas.\n\nAfter 348 games in H-Town, Battier was traded again, this time back to Memphis in 2011.\n\nBut his return to the Grizzlies was short-lived, signing for the Miami Heat the following offseason, joining the likes of LeBron James, Juwan Howard, and Dwayne Wade.\n\nOver the next three seasons, Battier and the Heat would win two NBA Championships - the second of which proved to be his final game.\n\nSince retiring, he has continued to work with his foundation, The Battier Take Charge Foundation, which he founded back in 2008, as per his LinkedIn.\n\nIn 2020, he joined investment management firm BOA Acquisition Corp. as a member of their board of directors.\n\nHe subsequently joined the boards of tech firm Yext and Authentic Restaurant Brands.\n\nBattier also works as an operations advisor for the private investment company Arctos and as a consultant for the IT firm Plusgrade.\n\nAnd if this wasn't enough, he also founded the Sport and Organization Dynamics Institute in 2021.\n\nFast forward to 2023, and Battier shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he had starred in an episode of Celebrity Jeopardy! in October.\n\nAppearing on behalf of his foundation, he appeared alongside actors Melissa Fumero and Steven Weber.\n\n\"Had the best time at @CelebJeopardy! Congrats to @melissafumero and Steven Weber for braving public shame and raising money for amazing charities. A dream come true tonight!\" he wrote."
