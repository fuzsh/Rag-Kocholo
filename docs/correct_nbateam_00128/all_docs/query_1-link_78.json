My thoughts on how the Rockets match up with the Suns (when Raja is available, at least) are here. -TexSUN]\n\nPhoenix Suns vs.\n\nHouston Rockets 46-22 47-22 7:00 PM Pacific / 10:00 PM Eastern TV: FSN AZ HD, NBA League Pass Probable starters: Steve Nash PG Rafer Alston Leandro Barbosa? SG Tracy McGrady Grant Hill SF Shane Battier Amare Stoudemire PF Luis Scola Shaquille O'Neal C Dikembe Mutombo\n\nMatch-ups with the Rockets\n\nI had some time w/ my coffee and was thinking about tonight's matchups:\n\nThe word still seems to be that Raja isn't going to play except the official team game notes shows him as a probably starter and lists him as \"questionable\".\n\nAssuming he doesn't play - which I am thinking is the most likely scenario - then the talk is about LB starting and then who does he cover. Coro seems to think they will play Hill on T-Mac and have LB try and cover Battier. Since Shane isn't a tremendous scorer other then spot up three's this isn't a terrible idea but I have two others:\n\nStart Diaw. With Nash, Diaw, Hill, Amare and Shaq you have a pretty big line up but that matches up well with Houston's size if they indeed start Deke. Deke didn't play last night at all against the Warriors btw and I except him to start on Shaq. You can switch Diaw and Hill on the perimeter and even Amare can switch on to Battier giving you Nash on Alston and Shaq on Deke.\n\nIf you do start LB or during the various rotations, then I think you let LB cover T-Mac at least in the first half. Can LB cover T-Mac? No way. But Tracy played 40 minutes last night and has said that his legs are getting tired after back to back games. And of course GG can come in and play Tracy as well.\n\nIf you put LB on T-Mac you are basically baiting him into scoring early which does two things: It wears him down faster so late in the game he's not a threat and even better it prevents the other guys from going off.\n\nThe last thing you want is guys other then Tracy getting hot. That's how they beat LA. LB on Battier is too big a mismatch even w/ Shaq in the post to help.\n\nOh, and Nash really, really needs to stay glued to Alston and not let him get hot early in the game. The guy defines streaky and if you can keep him from getting open looks early that will help.\n\nCoach D? Are you listening to me!!"
