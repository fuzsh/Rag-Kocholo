        "text": "You’ve heard it asked here plenty of times by now — can the Rockets get back to great defense?\n\nIf they can, they’re a legitimate contender. No question. They have enough offensive firepower to wreak serious havoc. But if they can’t, if the handcuffs on Yao or the anchor of a backcourt that won’t be mistaken for lockdown prove to be too big of burdens, the Rockets could fall to middle-of-the-pack in the West.\n\nNo player represents the Rockets’ defensive identity more than forward Shane Battier. The 6-foot-8 veteran has anchored the team’s defense since he arrived in a Draft Day trade in 2006.\n\nHe might be a good person to ask.\n\n“You have to understand — we were so small last year,” said Battier on Tuesday. “We had to become an offensive team to overcome our defensive shortcomings. We were just a very small team. With the influx of big guys, with Yao Ming back, we feel we can protect the rim better, and as a result, I think our defense will improve dramatically.”\n\nBattier says the Rockets, just a few days into training camp, aren’t there yet, but he feels they can get there in short order.\n\n“I don’t think it will take a long time,” said Battier. “You just have to keep hammering the themes and the principles that we are trying to teach. Again, last year we couldn’t do some of the things because we were just limited physically. This year we don’t have that excuse. It’s just a matter of staying on top of guys and reinforcing the different philosophies every single day.”\n\nShane’s belief about defense doesn’t synch up with the idea that there are “poor defenders” — in the backcourt or anywhere.\n\n“As long as you play with effort on defense, you can become a good defender,” said Battier. “There’s no secret. If you play hard and you give the effort, you can do some pretty good things on the defensive end.”\n\nThe Rockets made a surprise trade on Thursday, sending the contract of Victor Oladipo and three second-round picks to Memphis for center Steven Adams.\n\nThe deal came together quickly and the Rockets had a small window to get it done, hence why this trade was made with a week to go until the trade deadline.\n\nThe Price\n\nWhen you consider that Memphis did this for cost savings primarily and that Adams would not play for any team in the league this season, the price seemed a little high to me. The Rockets gave up the OKC second-round pick this year, which is no big loss, but they also give up the better of Brooklyn’s or Golden State’s second-round pick this season. That’s a pretty good pick (likely in the late 30’s). They also give up the better of Houston’s or OKC’s second-round pick in 2025. If things go as planned for the Rockets, that pick should be in the 45-55 range.\n\nBut they didn’t sacrifice a first-round pick, which would have been brutal, and they were not going to use all those seconds this season. So it’s just a matter of opportunity cost — who else could they have gotten for this package?\n\nMy understanding is they (particularly Ime Udoka) are very high on Adams.\n\nThe Rockets also did this move for cap purposes as well. By moving out the Oladipo contract, which was expiring, and bringing in Adams’ deal, which is signed for $12.4M next season, the window for the Rockets to put together a trade package for a star player is extended out until the 2025 trade deadline. They continue to wait to see which players, if any, shake loose here and become available. They want flexible (see: expiring) contracts that they can combine with assets and this gives them another year to be in that position.\n\nThe Trade\n\nIt’s not often that the Rockets acquire a player I had not considered beforehand but that’s the case with Steven Adams. The Rockets sorely need a big with size that provides more traditional center strengths, making Clint Capela, Robert Williams, Nick Richards or Daniel Gafford potential candidates, but Adams was overlooked for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, the 30-year old big man is out for the season after knee surgery cost him the entire 2023-24 campaign, so the Rockets won’t get any benefit from this trade this season. Secondly, Adams is not your traditional center either when it comes to rim protection.\n\nBut what Adams does do, he’s really good at and he has some of the same strengths of Brook Lopez, who the Rockets tried to sign in the offseason. Adams is quite possibly the strongest guy in the league and a legitimate 6-foot-11 with a 7-foot-5 wingspan. He’s an outstanding screen-setter, something that could really benefit the likes of Fred VanVleet, Amen Thompson and Jalen Green. He was also an elite rebounder last season, finishing 6th in the league in caroms at 11.5 a game despite playing just 27.0 minutes a contest.\n\nAfter watching Jonas Valanciunas absolutely bully the Rockets inside on Wednesday, it should be apparent by now to everyone that this was a pretty big need.\n\nIn 2021-22, the Memphis Grizzlies finished #2 in the West at 56-26. Their top two players in Net Rating that season were Dillon Brooks (+11.0) and Adams (+8.3), key cogs in a defense that held opponents to 108.6 points per 100 possessions. They’re both now Houston Rockets.\n\nSo this adds another trusted vet to Ime Udoka’s rotation.\n\nThe question is will the 30-year old Adams return to form after the knee injury? Adams sprained the posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee a year ago, which cost him the end of that season and the playoffs. He tried rehabbing it and it never got better, so surgery became the option just as this season was kicking off.\n\nI like to think the Rockets did their due diligence on that, despite the short time it took for this deal to come together, but that’s unclear.\n\nIf he does bounce back, then Udoka has a big man he can turn to reliably in situational matchups or on nights when the younger bigs struggle. He wouldn’t be Boban or even Jock Landale in that scenario — he’s going to play, so the frontcourt depth in 2024-25 should be better. In the end, they got a starting-caliber center who will have no problems coming off the bench, and that’s what they were looking for."
