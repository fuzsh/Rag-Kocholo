The Houston Rockets finalized a proposed trade for forward Shane Battier on Wednesday.

Battier, 27, is headed to Houston from the Memphis Grizzlies, who received forward Stromile Swift and the rights to Rudy Gay.

"For someone who has never been traded, it is a shock," Battier said. "But then you start looking at the situation and it's a very positive situation for me."

Battier averaged 10.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 1.2 steals and 32.2 minutes in 396 NBA games with the Grizzlies upon being drafted sixth overall in 2001.

He departs Memphis as the franchise leader in games played (396) and steals (507), second in three-point baskets (389), third in blocked shots (418) and fourth in points scored (4,160).

"The thing I'm most looking forward to is playing for an organization that's hungry to return to the playoffs," Battier said. "It's an exciting challenge."

Swift also was drafted by the Grizzlies (second overall in 2000) and played five seasons between Vancouver and Memphis before joining Houston as a free agent last Aug. 2.

With the Rockets, the 26-year-old averaged 8.8 points, 4.4 rebounds and 20.3 minutes over 66 appearances.

"We missed his ability to change the game, through his shot blocking and versatility to play multiple positions," Grizzlies president of basketball operations Jerry West said. "We are thrilled with his return."

Gay, a 19-year-old forward drafted eighth overall out of Connecticut last month, promptly signed a two-year contract with the Grizzlies upon the completion of Wednesday's trade.

Financial terms were not disclosed, but the pact includes team options for a third and fourth year.

"We are hopeful people will enjoy watching this special kind of athlete," West said.
