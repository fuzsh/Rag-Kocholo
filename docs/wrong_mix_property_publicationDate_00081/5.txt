John was a quiet man of faith, with a love for his country and family. He graduated from Fort Supply High School in 1954 and immediately joined the United States Air Force. While stationed in Casablanca, French Morocco he met Esther "Katy' where she was working at the uso. They fell in love and were married in Morocco before returning to Fort Supply to start their family. They were blessed with two sons, Glen and Mike. John was a farmer and rancher, but also worked as a heavy equipment operator for the State of Oklahoma until his retirement. He enjoyed woodworking, hunting and fishing. John played basketball as a youth and loved watching football. He especially loved the family fishing trips to South Fork, Colorado. But his greatest joy was spending time with his family, grandchildren and great grandchildren. They moved to Piedmont, Oklahoma in April 2014 to be close to family after spending his entire life in Fort Supply. John is preceded in death by his parents, Robert and Georgia Norman; sisters, Virginia Keeton, Ruby Fleming, Frances Mitchell; brother, Bobby Norman, and son Glen Norman.
