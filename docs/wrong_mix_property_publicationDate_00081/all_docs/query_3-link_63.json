        "text": "The John Norman Collins press collection is an accumulation of press materials, clippings, press releases, and video collected in the month preceding and years after John Collins was formally arraigned for the murder of Karen Sue Beineman, a student enrolled at Eastern Michigan University. Once on trial, Collins became linked to 6 other murders that took place in Southeast Michigan between 1967 and 1969. Known as the Michigan Murders, the young female victims were between the ages of 13 and 21, and while Collins was only sentenced in the murder for the final victim it is believed that he is responsible for the 5 remaining murders and a sixth girl in California. Collins was a graduate of St. Clement High School and was 24 credits short of degree completion at Eastern Michigan University in the School of Education. The materials in the collection include Newspapers clippings that date from 1969-2007, with the bulk of materials collected during the 1969 trial they are organized chronologically; Research and press materials that include official press releases and statements from the University; and audio visual materials with clips from news coverage in the 1980s and 90s. There is nothing in the collection from the original court case or investigative files."
