        "text": "I’m planning on sending my husband’s small collection (I think it’s the first 8 books) of Gor novels to a friend who is unfamiliar with them.\n\nDid I mischaracterize or malign John Norman by calling the Gor novels “soft porn”? I read the first half of the first book (and saw some of the covers of the others) and thought it seemed like thinly, very thinly, disguised erotica (and I’ve got nothing against erotica, thinly disguised or no), but maybe there’s a whole heap of plot and characterization that comes later or that I missed already?\n\nNo so much “porn” as the novels are actually pretty chaste when it comes to talking about sex. The porn part to the extent you want to consider it “porn” is the endless, and ultimately tedious philosophical wanking on how good (Gorean) women really want to be slaves and need a good, strong master to guide them. There’s also a lot of discussion on binding techniques and guides to properly enslaving a woman. The most explicit the novels ever got would be considered downright prudish by romance novel standards.\n\nWoven through the enslaving meme there are a few decent adventure stories being told, but I don’t think it’s going to be any woman’s cup of tea unless she enjoys submission fantasies as women are largely chattel in the Gorean universe.\n\nYou might also want to see about the value of the books before shipping them. The Gor books were out of print for some time and IIRC some of them (even the paperbacks) are quite valuable as collector’s items\n\nYes, the first eight or so novels were mostly adventure stuff (Priest Kings being my favorite). It wasn’t until they hit double digits that he started going really deeply into the slavery thing. And it was never sexually explicit.\n\nThe first dozen or so are pretty easy to find in used book stores, but the later ones are really rare (I think there are about 26 all together). So I doubt that your collection has a lot of monetary value, unless they are pristine first editions. By the way, I don’t think they were *ever *published in hardcover.\n\nThe first book is a good fantasy book read. Norman knew he had to keep the bondage issues relatively low-profile to sell the first book. Books 2 and 3 are not bad reads, though the direction of the bondage issue becomes more ovbious. Book 4 (Nomads) was both the best book of the series (it’s actually interesting seeing where he goes with his stylized nomadic peoples) and the worst of the series to that point (he takes the wrapping paper off and simply gets to the heart of the bondage issue). Books 5 and 6 were more of the same as 4, with pretty decent plots going on.\n\nThe whole thing went totally South starting with Book 7 (Captive), which is the first book not dealing with Tarl Cabot, the main protagonist. From that point forward, the plot-line of the books (the struggle of the Priest-Kings against the Kurii, and the efforts of Tarl Cabot to find his ex-“wife” from the first book, modified by his efforts on behalf of the Priest-Kings) takes back seat to the various philosophical wanderings by the author through the concept of sex and bondage, as applied to the “proper” role of men and women in life. As a teen in the 70s, I was hooked on the first books (both because of the plots and because of the implied sex). I simply gave up buying the books after about #12, though I seem to recall having read 13-16 either by borrowing or reading in the bookstore. I simply got tired of the message, and impatient with the plots, which never seemed to be headed towards any resolution of the underlying themes.\n\n“John Norman”, btw, is a professor of Philosophy at Queens College, CUNY."
