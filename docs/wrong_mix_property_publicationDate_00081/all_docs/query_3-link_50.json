Ed had recently lost his father, Ed Sr., who had spent over 20 years in the FDNY with Ladder Company 124. That is Ed Sr. with the irons in the photo at the 10-alarm fire in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in July 1977, at Knickerbocker Avenue and Bleecker St., one block south of Myrtle Ave.\n\nI had met Ed Sr. and his lovely wife at their home last spring, and he mentioned that this fire occurred on his first day back from vacation. That's a heck of a way to get back into the swing of things!\n\nEd told me that the Tower Ladder was saved by the chauffeur who, while operating under the constant drenching of a hoseline operated by Engine 218, was able to get back to the apparatus and remove all the manually operated pins from the 4 jacks and 2 outriggers, and drive the rig out of harmâ€™s way with only minor paint damage and a few melted warning lights. The radiant heat from the 5 floors of fire in the original fire building was so bad that the nozzle team operating the hoseline to cover TL-124's chauffeur had to be protected with a second hoseline playing directly on the first team.\n\nEddie Jr. spent over 20 years as a firefighter in another busy Brooklyn Ladder Company, L-175. He was injured in the line of duty and placed on long-term light duty. That is when we became friends. He was assigned as my aide when I became a staff chief, and we drove to and from work together, usually driving up Bushwick Avenue to Myrtle Avenue before heading west to Headquarters.\n\nOn the afternoon of Ed's last day on the job, we were driving home along Myrtle Avenue when Battalion 28 transmitted a 2nd alarm at Myrtle Ave and Knickerbocker Ave. Since we were only 10 blocks away, we took it in. The fire ended up a 4th alarm with fire in about 8 attached row frames. Eddie went to his last fire at the same box that his father had responded to 26 years earlier.\n\nIt was great seeing you again, pal. I hope you stay well and maybe we can drive up Bushwick Ave. again some day.\n\nPhoto by Ff.
