        "text": "April 9, 2015\n\nIt was not a regular book 4 star, but it was a Gor book 4 star. Those who read the series would understand:)\n\nMay 8, 2009\n\nThis was actually the best of the rest, those books after the first 10. I liked the focus on the Gorean chess and found it interesting from a cultural perspective.\n\nAugust 24, 2017\n\nSince PLAYERS OF GOR and MAGICIANS OF GOR share some of the same characters I consider MAGICIANS the sequel; if not that then a solid companion volume. Conditions differ in each book, in PLAYERS Ar had yet to be defeated and sacked. When Tarl Cabot returns to Port Kar he learns the Priest-Kings crave his head on a stick. Why? He'd just busted his hump for them in the Barrens, collared as well. And before that little escapade, in the course of running other dangerous errands for them, he'd sweated in jungles and almost frozen on polar ice caps. His failure to take out the Kur war general Zarendargar on more than one occasion might ultimately be the reason the Priest-Kings are a little hot under the carapace. Cabot blows town and hits the road with the humorous Boots Tarsk-Bit (one of John Norman's very best characters) and his traveling troupe of actors and magicians.\n\nHighlights in PLAYERS include a grand carnival scene early on and, later, the distinguished protagonist donning leather gloves for purposes unknown. Levity is provided in the book by that disreputable free spirit Boots Tarsk-Bit, thespian, illusionist and fringe-element criminal with only the best interests in mind, his own. This outing also marks the last time a Kur figures into a story arc for many a year and many another book. It is, however, not the last time a slave girl does.\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\nJust a normal day on Gor with there attitudes toward the division of the sexes and classes playing a major part in this book. The writing was rather predictable ( for those of us who have read so many of those Counter-earth novels ) the plot takes an interesting twist or two near the end. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in life as it it could be but isn't.\n\nSeptember 19, 2022\n\nAn OK read but great when you actually get to the story line. The constant slave portion gets old as it is the same through each and every book written in the series.\n\nNovember 18, 2016\n\nExcellent\n\nI tried reading this out of order because the synopsis said it could be read out of sequence, don't believe it some of the stories are in 2 or 3 parts, or end in a cliffhanger, this is one of those. This one didn't drag on too much about the women longing to be mastered by a man, though it did explain a little too much about the game of Kaiassa (similar to chess). Bosk or Tarl becomes a member of a troupe of actors (Players) so he can enter the city of Brundisium on Priest Kings business and get some codes that will help him decipher Kaiassa plays that might be strategic plans to invade the city of Ar, I really enjoyed this story, it had some intense moments and some that were exciting, I hope you enjoy.\n\nApril 12, 2014\n\nSo we embark on another long story arc, and Tarl takes up with a band of travelling performers as part of a ruse to get into Brundisium unnoticed. It's because he believes dark deeds are afoot between Kurii & Priest Kings, leading to Priest Kings declaring him persona non grata & launching (or so he at first thinks) attempts on his life.\n\nIn the course of gaining entrance to the city, naturally, a few women become enslaved. Funny how that always happens, isn't it?\n\nBy the end, a massive full-scale assault on Ar is launched by the forces of Cos & Tyros. And Tarl learns that none other than Talena is at the heart of the conspiracy!\n\nSeptember 3, 2011\n\nI read this whole series in a marathon session, while stationed in England. The depth and volume of the stories is humbling for any writer and I consider this series very influential in my own approach to writing and world building in general; generic post for all the books in this series as I am finally getting around to recording my reading list in Goodreads."
