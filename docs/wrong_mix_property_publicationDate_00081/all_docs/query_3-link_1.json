        "text": "American professor and writer\n\nFor other uses, see John Norman (disambiguation).\n\nJohn Frederick Lange Jr. (born June 3, 1931) is an American writer who, as John Norman, has authored the Gor series of science fantasy novels. Norman is also a philosophy professor.\n\nLange was born in Chicago, Illinois, to John Frederick Lange and Almyra D. Lange (n√©e Taylor).\n\nHe began his academic career in the early 1950s, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Nebraska in 1953, and his Master of Arts degree from the University of Southern California in 1957.\n\nLange married Bernice L. Green on January 14, 1956 while he was still a student at USC. The couple have three children: John, David, and Jennifer.\n\nLange earned his PhD in 1963 from Princeton University. His dissertation was named: \"In defence of ethical naturalism: an examination of certain aspects of naturalistic fallacy, with particular attention to the logic of an open question argument\". Lange summed it up in an interview by saying \"if one cannot make sense of morality within some sort of satisfying, natural context, then one is likely to end up with no morality, which is less than societally reassuring, or is likely to end up with a competitive plethora of moralities in which ninety-nine percent of the world's population is convinced that the other ninety-nine percent is unclean, stupid, uninformed, vicious, depraved, in need of coercive correction, and such. That too, seems less than reassuring.\"[1]\n\nHe was a professor at Queens College of the City University of New York[2] before retirement.\n\nNorman's fiction attained popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s with an estimated 6[3] to 12[4] million copies sold.\n\nJohn Norman's Gorean Saga is a long-running series of adventure science fantasy novels, starting in December 1966 with Tarnsman of Gor. The series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment, Magicians of Gor, in 1988, when DAW refused to publish its successor, Witness of Gor. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet, the series was brought back into print in 2001 with the publication of Witness of Gor. Norman has also produced a separate science fiction series, the Telnarian Histories, plus three other fiction works, five non-fiction works, and a collection of thirty short stories.\n\nNorman has said that the three major influences on his work are Homer, Freud, and Nietzsche.[5]\n\nAccording to Norman, his Gor books are science fiction or adventure fantasy works which are also \"intellectual, philosophical, and psychological novels\".[6] His fiction depicts fantastic worlds where male-dominated bondage relationships are natural and widely practiced and respected culturally, whereas characteristics of modern society are criticized and philosophical themes are explored, especially from a Nietzschean view.\n\nAlthough the bondage in his Imaginative Sex guide is directed to sexual practices, the bondage and slavery presented on \"Gor\" follows along the lines of societal or legal slavery; a common way of life as reflected in ancient Rome and other societies. While the philosophy presented is unquestionably that of male dominance, male characters are themselves occasionally enslaved by powerful females. In an interview[1] with Polygraff magazine, Norman stated that he believes that it is obvious that all societies are based on dominance and hierarchy.\n\nDespite his books being associated with BDSM, Norman is openly critical of the community. In a 2011 interview with Gizmodo, he stated, \"I dissociate myself from BDSM, at least as I understand it. I may, of course, misunderstand it. I wonder if one would settle merely for 'real-life Gorean slavery', because, as I understand it, BDSM is not Gorean. If something is not beautiful, it is not Gorean.\"[7]\n\nHis non-fiction works cover philosophy, ethics and historiography.\n\nA fandom based on his Gor novels, known as the Gorean subculture, has developed[8][9][10] without Lange's direct involvement. Scholars have discussed the way that Gorean subculture groups on media such as IMVU, Second Life,[8] and Internet Relay Chat have influenced the development of online role-playing and even the MMORPG genre.[9]\n\nTarnsman of Gor (1966) ISBN 0-345-27583-7\n\nOutlaw of Gor (1967) ISBN 0-345-27136-X\n\nPriest-Kings of Gor (1968) ISBN 0-7592-0036-X\n\nNomads of Gor (1969) ISBN 0-7592-5445-1\n\nAssassin of Gor (1970) ISBN 0-7592-0091-2\n\nRaiders of Gor (1971) ISBN 0-7592-0153-6\n\nCaptive of Gor (1972) ISBN 0-7592-0105-6\n\nHunters of Gor (1974) ISBN 0-7592-0130-7\n\nMarauders of Gor (1975) ISBN 0-7592-0141-2\n\nTribesmen of Gor (1976) ISBN 0-7592-5446-X\n\nSlave Girl of Gor (1977) ISBN 0-7592-0454-3\n\nBeasts of Gor (1978) ISBN 0-7592-1125-6\n\nExplorers of Gor (1979) ISBN 0-7592-1167-1\n\nFighting Slave of Gor (1980) ISBN 0-7592-1173-6\n\nRogue of Gor (1981) ISBN 0-7592-1179-5\n\nGuardsman of Gor (1981) ISBN 0-7592-1368-2\n\nSavages of Gor (1982) ISBN 0-7592-1374-7\n\nBlood Brothers of Gor (1982) ISBN 0-7592-1380-1\n\nKajira of Gor (1983) ISBN 0-7592-1926-5\n\nPlayers of Gor (1984) ISBN 0-7592-1932-X\n\nMercenaries of Gor (1985) ISBN 0-7592-1944-3\n\nDancer of Gor (1985) ISBN 0-7592-1950-8\n\nRenegades of Gor (1986) ISBN 0-7592-1956-7\n\nVagabonds of Gor (1987) ISBN 0-7592-1980-X\n\nMagicians of Gor (1988) ISBN 0-7592-1986-9\n\nWitness of Gor (2001) ISBN 0-7592-4235-6\n\nPrize of Gor (2008) ISBN 0-7592-4580-0\n\nKur of Gor (2009) ISBN 0-7592-9782-7\n\nSwordsmen of Gor (2010) ISBN 1-6175-6040-5\n\nMariners of Gor (2011) ISBN 0-7592-9989-7\n\nConspirators of Gor (2012) ISBN 1-6175-6731-0\n\nSmugglers of Gor (Oct. 2012) ISBN 1-6175-6865-1\n\nRebels of Gor (Oct. 2013) ISBN 1-6175-6123-1\n\nPlunder of Gor (August 2016) ISBN 1-5040-3406-6\n\nQuarry of Gor (June 2019) ISBN 1-5040-5832-1\n\nAvengers of Gor (May 25, 2021), Open Road Distribution, ISBN 1-5040-6714-2\n\nWarriors of Gor (Aug 30, 2022), Open Road Distribution, ISBN 1-5040-7672-9\n\nTreasure of Gor (April 23, 2024), Open Road Distribution, ISBN 1-5040-8949-9\n\nThe Chieftain (1991) ISBN 1-58586-717-9\n\nThe Captain (1992) ISBN 1-58586-721-7\n\nThe King (1993) ISBN 1-58586-725-X\n\nThe Usurper (2015) ISBN 978-1497679269\n\nThe Emperor (May 2019) ISBN 1-5040-5816-X\n\nGhost Dance (1970) ISBN 0-7592-9774-6\n\nTime Slave (1975) ISBN 0-7592-9778-9\n\nThe Totems of Abydos (2012) ISBN 978-1-6175-6476-5\n\nNorman Invasions (2009) ISBN 0-7592-9577-8\n\nValues and Imperatives: Studies in Ethics.
