        "text": "Professor Norman (Ph.D. London School of Economics, 1988) is the Mike and Ruth Mackowski Distinguished Professor of Ethics in Philosophy and the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke. He previously held Chairs in Business Ethics at the Université de Montréal and the University of British Columbia, and before that taught at the University of Ottawa and the University of Western Ontario. He has held visiting appointments in eight countries and been published in 10 languages. He has taught mainly in philosophy departments, but also in two MBA programs, and a political science department.\n\nNorman plays blues guitar and sings in a band called Mona Lisa's Highway Blues, which won “Most Original Performance” at the 2015 Triangle Battle of the Bands charity event, and in Yoga Imposters. He is working on a collection of \"Ivory Tower Rocks\" songs about philosophical arguments, like this one on the Trolley Problem.\n\nProfessor Norman is a cat person.\n\nRESEARCH & TEACHING INTERESTS\n\nMost of Norman's recent research falls under two broad headings:\n\nBUSINESS ETHICS.He has looked critically at a number of frameworks for identifying and justifying beyond-compliance obligations (e.g. CSR, corporate citizenship, sustainability, triple bottom line, stakeholder theory...). His working hypothesis is that beyond-compliance obligations can be justified in large part by using the same concepts and methods we use in justifying particular regulations. (\"Business ethics as self-regulation.\") His most recent research looks at the ways theories of justice and democracy require an account of political economy that takes corporations, corporate law, and regulation seriously -- and on the near-complete neglect of these issues in the post-Rawlsian tradition of political philosophy.\n\nPOLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. Norman has published extensively on nationalism, citizenship, constitutionalism, federalism, secession, and multiculturalism. His most recent research concerns the design and justification of the administrative agencies responsible for most law-making (especially concerning the regulation of business) in a modern state -- and in particular, it asks whether contemporary democratic theory is of much use for helping us to address these institutional and normative issues.\n\nHe is currently writing three books:\n\nBusiness Ethics on the Fly. A short tool-kit-style alternative to a textbook.\n\nThe Ethical Adversary: Can you play fair when you're playing to win? An enquiry into the challenges posed to standard accounts of justice and ethics by institutions that are deliberately designed to harness competition (such as sports, markets, the adversarial legal system, and democratic politics).\n\nWhiteface: What midcentury vinyl album covers teach us about race and gender in American, then and now. An \"intellectual coffee table book\" featuring ~300 LPs from Norman's private collection.\n\nSelected Recent Publications (5 books, 90+ articles; 8 articles have been re-published in other journals or books, in English or in translation, at least 27 times):\n\nSELECTED RECENT BOOKS\n\nNegotiating Nationalism: Nation-building, Federalism, and Secession in the Multinational State, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. xxi + 250.\n\nD.
