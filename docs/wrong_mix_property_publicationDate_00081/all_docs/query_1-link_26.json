He was formerly a member of the United Brethren Church, but for the past eight years has had membership with the Wesley Methodist Church.\n\nThe cause of education finds in him a warm friend and he gives his support to all social and moral interests. He is a pleasant, agreeable gentleman, very popular in the community and his hospitable home is a favorite resort with his many friends."
