        "text": "1556 Di Gastaldi. New France\n\nThe following description comes from the Library of Stony Brook University.\n\nGastaldi’s map of New France is the earliest printed map focusing on what is now northeastern Canada and the United States. Published in the third volume of J.B. Ramusio's Viagi (Voyages), it is largely based on the voyages of Cartier and Verrazano. The Hudson River, the St. Lawrence River, and the islands near the Gulf of St. Lawrence are the most prominent features on this map. A curious snake-like projection in the Atlantic Ocean has been the subject of much speculation. It is probably an attempt to depict the Grand Banks. An “Island of Sand” (Isola della Rena) is part of this feature--possibly it is Sable Island. The depiction of the area between New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay is based on the voyage of Verrazano in 1524. The area around New York Harbor is named Angoulesme. The large bay to the east of New York Harbor is probably Jamaica Bay, which was more open to the ocean at that time. Long Island, which Verrazano thought was a peninsula, is labeled Flora. Newport Bay is Port Real on the map, and Narragansett Bay is Port du Refuge. Block Island appears as Brisa. Note that the Hudson River is shown joining the St Lawrence. This curious feature may derive from the use of information gathered from Native American informants. Some early maps drawn by American Indians show canoe routes, and do not distinguish between waterways and portages.\n\n1610 Simancas. Northeastern Coast.\n\nAlso called The Velasco Map. An incredibly detailed early map that has alternatively been extolled by many scholars and described as a forgery in an article below by David Allen at Stony Brook University.\n\nThe following comes from Stokes, I. N. Phelps. The Iconography of Manhattan Island, 1498–1909. New York: Robert Dodd, 1915–1928. (6 vol) The Velasco Map: v2, pl. 22; 67–68\n\nOn 22 March 1611 Don Alonso de Velasco, the Spanish ambassador to England, sent a letter written in cipher with intelligence on English activities in Virginia to King Philip III of Spain. Enclosed with the letter was a pirated four-sheet manuscript “plan or map of that Province” reportedly made by an English surveyor in 1610 and drawn by an anonymous English cartographer. The Velasco map ended up in the General Archive of Simancas, where it remained forgotten until it was rediscovered by the historian Alexander Brown in 1887.\n\nThe map, a composite of not only English, but French and Dutch information, shows the discoveries of Hudson between Newfoundland and Virginia with close fidelity to Juet’s journals. It is the first map to show the (relatively) accurate course of the Hudson River, which is labelled with the Lanape names “Manahata” and “Manahatin.”\n\nThe map is “Drawn in colors on four sheets of paper pasted together and is 81 by 111 centimeters.\n\nOverall the map presents a remarkably accurate outline of North America. Perhaps too remarkable; as Samuel Adams Drake stated in 1892, “it is entirely too good for the state of discovery at that early period of the seventeenth century.” Early historians, such as Brown or Stokes thought the map to be authentic but current researchers are much more critical, considering it an expert forgery.5 Nevertheless, it remains the only early map of Hudson’s journeys.\n\nThe So-Called “Velasco Map”: A Case of Forgery?\n\nDavid Allen, Stony Brook University\n\nThis article examines a well-known map of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada allegedly made in or around 1610. The map was uncovered in the Spanish Archives at Simancas in 1887. Supposedly, it is a copy of an anonymous English map, which was sent to King Phillip III of Spain by the Spanish ambassador to London, Don Alonzo de Velasco. This article raises the possibility that the map may actually be a nineteenth-century forgery. The map is based primarily on information found on early seventeenth-century maps, most of which were not published in 1610, although it is possible that manuscript copies of these maps might have been available as early as 1610. The overall geographic framework of the map seems to be improbably accurate for its supposed date of creation. The map contains numerous oddities, and many features on the map do not appear on other maps made in the early seventeenth century. Overall it seems anachronistic and it stands in isolation from other maps made around 1600. Although no single feature on the map proves beyond a doubt that it is a forgery, the overall weight of the evidence makes it seem highly probable that it is a fake. Tests on the paper, pigment, and handwriting of the map should be made to prove conclusively whether or not it is a forgery.\n\n1676 John Speed. New England and New York.\n\nFrom Barry Lawrence Ruderman Antique Maps\n\nDecorative example of John Speed's map of the Northeast, from the 1676 edition of Speed's Prospect of the World. Speed's map is one of the earliest maps to illustrate dramatic shift from Dutch to English dominance in the Northeast in the latter part of the 17th Century and one of the earliest to use the term New York for both Manhattan (formerly New Amsterdam) and New York State, as well as one of the earliest appearances of New Iarsey (Jersey). As noted by Michael Buehler, Speed's map shares the traits of many other regional maps of the period: a haphazard depiction of the St. Lawrence, no sign of Lake Ontario, Lake Champlain offset far to the East of its actual location, Cape Cod at essentially the same latitude as New York City, and the Delaware River curving eastward to connect with the Hudson. Many of these errors can be traced far back to early 17th-century prototype maps by Samuel Champlain, Adrien Block and others.\n\nOne of only a small group of English maps of New England, prior to 1700. Based on Jansson's map of 1651, it illustrates the territories acquired by the British with the capture of New Amsterdam in 1664, which radically adjusted the landscape of North American politics. While the map's geographical features are largely drawn from Jansson, the map's nomenclature is substantially anglicized, including the first appearance of name Boston (omitted from the Jansson maps), and the use of the names New York and Cape Cod.\n\nThe map is richly embellished with various animals in the interior of the map, two compass roses, two cartouches and a coat of arms. Engraved by Francis Lamb after Speed's death, the map appeared in the 1676 edition of Speed's Prospect of the Most Famous Parts of the World.\n\n1735 Southack. The Sea Coast from New York to Cape Breton.\n\nAn early and very detailed map of a large coastal region showing fairly good portrayal of Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket and the Elizabeth Islands. Depicts Chappaquiddick as “Indian Town” and as separate from Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nA number of excellent versions of this map are available at the Boston Public Library.\n\nOne is provided here along with a reproduction from Wigglesworth’s thesis.\n\nBelow, by Clara Egli LeGear, John Nickelis, and George Martin. 1954. The New England Coasting Pilot of Cyprian Southack. Imago Mundi 11: 137-144.\n\nOne of the cartographical rarities of colonial America is a pilot guide of the northeast coast, of which only three copies are known. It bears the lengthy and descriptive title of The New England Coasting Pilot from Sandy Point of New York, unto Cape Canso in Nova Scotia, and Part of Island Breton. With the Courses and Distances from Place to Place, and towns on the Sea-Board; Harbours, Bays, Islands, Roads, Rocks, Sands: The Setting and Flowing of tides and Currents; with several other Directions of great Advantage to this Part of Navigation in North-America. By Capt. Cyprian Southack, who has been Cruizing in the Service of the Crown of Great Britain Twenty-two years.\n\nSouthack, who was for seventeen years captain of the Massachusetts Province Galley, often supplied information to his fellow captains for bringing their vessels safely into port. As sailing charts were inadequate and harbor charts non-existent, Southack undertook the task of preparing some of these essential aids to navigation. He is known to have prepared upward of twenty maps. His most ambitious undertaking was The New England Coasting Pilot.\n\nThe eight maps in the Coasting Pilot contain a wealth of information gathered by Southack as he sailed up and down the coast. There are over 100 descriptive notes on the places named, the longest of which accompanies the inset of Louisburg Harbor on the last map. Some of the notes mention Southack's participation in the several English expeditions against the French in Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. Others reflect his interest in safe harbors, navigational hazards, water depths, tides and currents, as well as natural resources, potential industries, fishing grounds, fish drying sites, timber for masts and for ship building. In the note on the Strait of Canso between Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, Southack claims to have been the first Englishman ever to have sailed through it in 1690.\n\nThe arm of Cape Cod shown as an island is a characteristic of Southack's New England coast charts. He had good reason to draw a strait in the vicinity of Eastham, Massachusetts, for he sailed a boat through it on April 26, 1717, when he was commissioned to take charge of a pirate ship which had been wrecked near there. Southack was not averse to naming places for himself, so we find the present Chedabucto Bay in northeastern Nova Scotia called Southack Bay, and Monhegan Island on the coast of Maine called \"Southacks Island or Monhegan\", in the Coasting Pilot, though neither name has survived.\n\nThe New England Coasting Pilot was published by subscription and the leaf following the title page lists \"The Names of those persons that have Subscribed Towards the Charge of Engraving and Printing This Work, for the Publick Good. His Excellency Francis Nicholson, Esq; was pleased to subscribe near One half part of the whole Expence.\n\nThe following Persons, One Guinea each\". There follow two columns of 73 names to which eight have been added in ink. Little wonder, then, that Southack dedicated the Coasting Pilot \"To His Excellency Francis Nicholson Esqr. Governour, Captain General, and Commander in chief, in and over His Majesty's Province of South Carolina, and Vice Admiral of y same ...\" (4).\n\nThe three [original] copies of the map are located in the British Public Record Office, British Museum, and in the Library of Congress.\n\n1776 Des Barres. Eastern Half of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket.\n\nSource: Library of Congress\n\nA fascinating early map that is equally tantalizing for what it does not show: the rest of Martha’s Vineyard. It would be great to be able to evaluate the housing, fencing, shoreline and other features for the remainder of the Island. [But, see 1781 Des Barres for the rest of the Island in less detail and 1781 Des Barres Buzzards Bay for the western half with fencelines]. In this view the patterns are intriguing and likely emblematic rather than accurate for most of Katama is broken into similarly sized and shaped fields bounded by fences and containing scattered houses. Enigmatically, many of the fencelines portrayed run north to south, whereas in 1850 and today the length of fencelines running east to west is much greater. In contrast the broad details of the coastline as portrayed here matches well with that a century later. There are incomplete patterns of fences elsewhere to the west and north along the coast, along Sengekontacket, and up towards East Chop where Des Barres showed less detail. Chappaquiddick, which is shown as a separate island with a breach near Waque Point.\n\nDetails are unclear but it appears that a near connection exists between Poucha Pond and the marshes and pond at Wasque. At west end of “Matakies Bay” a series of small ponds appears to provide much of a connection to Edgartown Great Pond.\n\nOn East Chop houses are concentrated up at Eastville.\n\n1782 Crèvecœur. Nantucket.\n\nSource: Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library\n\nThe map come from J. Hector St. John De Crevecoer’s Letters from an American Farmer, which includes a lengthy description of Nantucket with considerably less information on Martha’s Vineyard. However, the map of Martha’s Vineyard is filled with great and interesting details on physical features and land-use history.\n\nIn contrast to the map of Martha’s Vineyard, more wind mills appear on Nantucket but the details on land use and variation across the island is less. Most of the land is depicted as broken into a handful of extremely large pastures separated by fences. A fulling mill (for making woolen cloth from the large sheep herd) is depicted and cultivated fields occur to the west of the harbor. The numbers scattered across the island refer to a legend and list of place names that are depicted on the low resolution 1787 French-titled version of the map.\n\nCrevecoeur (1735 – 1813) was a French – American writer who immigrated to New France in 1755 and subsequently moved to New York where he became a citizen and purchased a large and prosperous farm. Relocating to London in the early 1780s he published his series of essays Letters from an American Farmer, which became a major success. The work described American life, principles, and character to Europeans in terms of the new country. Crevecoeur had many important American friends, including Benjamin Franklin. According to local legend St. Johnsbury, Vermont was named by Ethan Allen, who proposed St. John to honor his friend De Crevecoeur. De Crevecoeur suggested St. Johnsbury to differentiate it from Saint John, New Brunswick.\n\nThere are English and French titled versions of both the Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard maps. See 1787\n\n1784 Crèvecœur. Carte De L’Isle de Martha’s Vineyard avec ses dependencies.\n\nSource: Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library\n\nThe map come from J. Hector St. John De Crevecoer’s Letters from an American Farmer, which includes a lengthy description of Nantucket with considerably less information on Martha’s Vineyard. However, the map of Martha’s Vineyard is filled with great and interesting details on physical features and land-use history. Large woodlands are depicted across the Great Plain, down towards Pohogonot, and out on Chappaquiddick. Squibnocket and Katama are referred to as sheep pastures, peat lands (presumably important as a source of fuel), are identified in Chilmark towards the shore of Menemsha Pond (where there are large swamps west of State Road) and out on Gay Head. Little Pond is termed the “Pond never dry” and the south coast is labeled as “The Great Beach against which the Sea continually beats”. The Poucha Pond salt marshes are not depicted.\n\nThough it is reported that De Crevecoeur relied extensively on correspondence for some of the details in the map one gets the strong sense that he examined the Island closely on his visit.\n\nNote the Elizabeth Islands and report on the number of houses: three on Nashawena, two on Slocum’s (Pasque) and two on Nonamisset. Penikese is shown as aligned with the rest of the chain of islands, and Woods Hole is reported as 90 houses\n\nIn contrast to the map of Martha’s Vineyard, more wind mills appear on Nantucket but the details on land use and variation across the island is less.

Squibnocket and Katama are referred to as sheep pastures, peat lands (presumably important as a source of fuel), are identified in Chilmark twoards the shore of Menemsha Pond (where there are large swamps west of State Road) and out on Gay Head, Little Pond is termed the “Pond never dry” and the south coast is labeled as “The Great Beach against which the Sea continually beats”.\n\nThough it is reported that De Crevecoeur relied extensively on correspondence for some of the details in the map one gets the strong sense that he examined the Island closely on his visit.\n\nNote the Elizabeth Islands and report on the number of houses: three on Nashawena, two on Slocum’s (Pasque) and two on Nonamisset. Penikese is shown as aligned with the rest of the chain of islands and Woods Hole is reported as 90 houses\n\nIn contrast to the map of Martha’s Vineyard, more wind mills appear on Nantucket but the details on land use and variation across the island is less. Most of the land is depicted as broken into a handful of extremely large pastures separated by fences. A fulling mill is depicted and cultivated fields occur to the west of the harbor. The numbers scattered across the island refer to a legend and list of place names that are depicted on the low resolution 1787 French-titled version of the map.\n\nCrevecoeur (1735 – 1813) was a French – American writer who immigrated to New France in 1755 and subsequently moved to New York where he became a citizen and purchased a large and prosperous farm. Relocating to London in the early 1780s he published his series of essays Letters from an American Farmer, which became a major success. The work described American life, principles, and character to Europeans in terms of the new country. Crevecoeur had many important American friends, including Benjamin Franklin. According to local legend St. Johnsbury, Vermont was named by Ethan Allen, who proposed St. John to honor his friend De Crevecoeur. De Crevecoeur suggested St. Johnsbury to differentiate it from Saint John, New Brunswick.\n\nThere are English and French titled versions of the Martha’s Vineyard map.\n\n1830 Crapo. Chappaquiddick.\n\nSource: Martha’s Vineyard Museum\n\nIn 1830 the legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts required that every town produce a map showing the features of its land. The majority of towns responded with products of variable quality that are especially of ecological interest as they depict land cover (forest, open agriculture, wetland), roads, houses and occasionally other features such as pine plains, mills, ponds and streams). The Harvard Forest assembled all of the available maps from the Massachusetts State Archives, interpreted and digitized these and made them broadly available for use in academic and applied studies (see Harvard Forest 1830 Map). Since the mapping was done as the landscape approached its peak of forest clearing and agricultural land use, the resulting charts provide key insights into arguably the most important historical processes that continue to shape the forests today. As a consequence, wide use has been made of these, including incorporation of the widely employed state BioMap project that identifies the biodiversity priorities for land protection across the state. To our knowledge Massachusetts is the only state in the US where detailed land cover information was comprehensively mapped at such an early date.\n\nWhile some towns hired local surveyors to meet the state mandate many others commissioned accomplished surveyors and cartographers for this work. Henry Crapo (1804 – 1869), who produced maps on the Vineyard, including this version for Chappaquiddick lay somewhere between these extremes. Born in Dartmouth , Massachusetts he lived in New Bedford into the 1840s and was a land surveyor, auctioneer, town clerk and collector of taxes who developed a advanced ability as a map and chart maker. The map of Chappaquiddick is fairly detailed in terms of land cover and some aspects of land use as it shows the separation of Indian lands to the north, major roads, some fences, extensive woodlands and salt marshes, and place names. Much more could be done with a better version of this map.\n\nSubsequently, Crapo was drawn by investments in pine forests to Flint, Michigan where he became mayor and eventually developed a thriving timber industry and became heavily invested in lucrative railroad businesses. He ultimately served as governor of Michigan from 1865 – 1869.\n\nFor more on the 1830 map see the Harvard Forest web page:\n\n1830 Massachusetts Map Documentation\n\n1830 Map of Land Cover and Cultural Features in Massachusetts\n\n1858 Walling. Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket Counties.\n\nSource: Library of Congress; Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library\n\nOne of the many maps from among the state, county, and town maps produced by Henry F. Walling of New York City. The colorful map, in which adjoining towns are distinguished by different colors, is most notable by the fact that the owners of houses and other buildings are identified and industries and uses such as gristmills, shops, schools, fisheries,\n\nDetailed insets of each town and village center provide considerable detail that, among other things are helpful in locating the various buildings associated with Dr. Daniel Fisher’s oil and candle businesses in Edgartown.\n\nOn the Vineyard a number of notable enterprises are shown in 1858: the Camp Meeting Ground, Lagoon Fishery (at the south end), Dr. Fisher’s oil shed, a wind-powered grist mill and school in the middle of the Edgartown plain above Katama, a fish house at Mattakeset Creek, the “Indian Lands” on North Neck, Herring Fishery, the Look, Luce and Athearn Grist Mills in West Tisbury, the Grist Mill and Brick Works on Roaring Brook, and the wind mill, Baptist Church, School, and Indian Lands out in Gay Head. The 1871 version has considerably less detail.\n\nHenry F. Walling was one of the most prolific and accomplished commercial map publishers in the U.S. in the late nineteenth century. In the 1850s and 60s, he focused on mapping of Massachusetts, first producing detailed maps of Massachusetts towns and then a set of wall-size Massachusetts county maps. The latter were produced though Walling’s commission by the legislature as “Superintendent of the State Map” where he had access to the best data including “Original Surveys.” A note on the 1858 map indicates that a “large portion of the Coast is laid down from materials obtained from the archives of the U.S. Coast Survey. Thus, it appears that Walling utilized existing state and federal data to play out the topographical and substantial geographical data for his mapping and then filled in details through ground-based work by himself and his staff.\n\nLater in his career Walling worked for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and then the U.S. Geological Survey, primarily on projects related to the mapping of New England and the Appalachians.\n\n1871 US Coastal Survey. Edgartown Harbor and Cotamy Bay.\n\nSource: Digital Commonwealth; NOAA\n\nThis map marks one of the great collaborations between two of the coastal Survey’s greatest scientists: Henry Whiting, cartographer who provided the topography and features of the land and Henry Mitchell (and in this case H. L. Marindin), hydrographer who provided the details on the bathymetry for the map. As related in The Meeting of Land and Sea, Mitchell and Whiting used this and subsequent work on the Vineyard, Katama Bay, and the opening at Norton Point to explain the broad dynamics of coastal erosion and the specific details of the forces that open and maintain, or lead to the closure of the bays and ponds on the south shore of the Vineyard. These studies are related in a series of U.S. Coastal Survey reports that are referenced in the volume’s bibliography. As noted on this map this specific chart relates to the report for 1869. The release of the report was delayed when the original was destroyed in the great Boston Fire of 1872, which destroyed 65 acres of downtown Boston.\n\nAspects of the long-standing research by these two men are apparent in the details and insets of this 1871 map. From Whiting these include the light tracing of the position of the southern opening of Katama Bay (1776, 1846, 1856) and vertical cross-sections of the barrier beach that seals the bay along with comparative cross-sections from the barrier beach at the Nantucket haulover and at Scituate on Cape Cod. Whiting’s papers reference the tremendous erosion and movement of material from the beach out into the bay and beyond and so he feasibly collaborated with Mitchell to produce the inset depicting the Section (AB) running from Chappaquiddick Point to the West Shore. Note also how the topographical survey is tied into the location and elevation, above sea level, of the Martha’s Vineyard National Bank.\n\nAs noted in the book Mitchell spent considerable effort studying the range, variation, and timing of the tides around the coast and especially on various positions inside and out of Katama (Cotamy) Bay. His inset graph comparing the tides inside and out served to bolster his explanation that the opening in the barrier beach was maintained by the tremendous erosive forces of the currents that sweep through that narrow channel, driven by the height differential of the water inside and outside the bay.\n\n1880 Plat & Environs of Lagoon Heights.\n\nSource: Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library\n\nThe oblique angle of this map provides a tremendous perspective on the character of the landscape across the broader area of East Chop, the north end of the Lagoon, Vineyard Haven, and out onto West Chop in 1880. Eastville remains thriving with two wharfs – New York and Norris (named for Howes Norris); the detailed insets help interpret the busy scene in Oak Bluff with the two tabernacles, Union Chapel, Cottage City and Highlands wharfs, and many hotels including the Highland House adjacent the Agassiz Summer Institute; to the south the road traversed Island Lake (Farm Pond) in the direction of a much exaggerated Lagoon Heights and to the west of town most of the area between Eastville, the Lagoon and the Heights remained empty; towards Vineyard Haven the Beach Road was fully connected over a bridge and two small bridges or walkways provided access out towards Cedar Neck; and out on West Chop the land remained largely forested.\n\nThe details for the Lagoon Heights development owned and marketed by the Lagoon Heights Land Company, State Street in Boston, are fleshed out well beyond those on the 1873 map by Pease. Many modern streets are depicted – among them Lindon, California, Columbia, Washington and Pennsylvania Avenues – but Maine has become Barnes Road and Front Street has been reduced to just a vestige of a planned formal eastern end to the new neighborhood.\n\n1887 U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.

A nearly identical description is provided for the second version of this map # CP2731C, which differs in minor details, including not showing the Martha’s Vineyard Railroad, which had been removed. Notes on the map indicate that this was first published in 1848, the topography was conducted by H.L. Whiting and W.I. Vinal between 1886 and 1891, and the map was published in 1894.\n\nView CP2396C at NOAA\n\nBackground: Office of Coast Survey's Historical Map & Chart Collection covers the land and waters of the United States of America, including territories and possessions (past and present).

Map of Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nSource: Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library\n\nThe map by G.W. Eldridge is considered decorative rather than detailed and is sold as a reproduction in Vineyard shops today. In addition to main roads, regional ferry routes, and major sights, the map identifies the locations of a number of major landowners (e.g., Butler at Windy Gates, Hammond at Squibnocket), many south shore camps, and the location of various life saving stations. It has at least one glaring error: Duartes Pond is both mis-spelled and incorrectly located much further west of the head of Lagoon Pond than it occurs.\n\nBackground on Eldridge and his related 1892 map are provided by Boston Rare Maps. The 1892 version provides a few names of the houses of local residents but omits the camps and large estates.\n\n“The map was published by G.W. Eldridge of Chatham, Mass. (1845-1914), the son and heir to the business of George Eldridge (1821-1900). The senior Eldridge produced his first chart (of the waters around Chatham) in 1851, and the firm bearing his name continued issuing charts until 1932, while the Eldridge Tide and Pilot Book remains in publication to this day. In contrast to the complex charts issued by the U.S. Coast Survey, Guthorn praises those issued by the Eldridges for their “good design, simplicity, and omission of extraneous shore topography, legible sounding and notes, and the use of compass courses only… Their loyal public; fishermen, coaster, tug masters, and yachtsmen, often continued to use obsolete Eldridge charts until the beginning of World War II.” (p.12)\n\nA second edition of the map appeared in 1913 with a number of changes and additions and is much more common than the first edition offered here."
