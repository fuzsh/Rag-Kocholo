        "text": "Biography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nJohn Norman Collins was born on June 17, 1947, in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He later moved to the United States with his family, settling in the Detroit, Michigan area. Raised in a seemingly ordinary environment, Collins' early life provided little indication of the dark path he would eventually follow.\n\nEducation and University Life[]\n\nCollins attended Eastern Michigan University in the late 1960s, where he pursued studies in education. During his time at the university, he became known for his involvement in social activities and sports, presenting a facade that contrasted with the sinister actions he would later be accused of committing.\n\nCriminal Activities[]\n\nIn the late 1960s, a series of gruesome murders occurred in and around the Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor areas of Michigan. These crimes, often targeting young women, were later attributed to John Norman Collins. His victims were typically college students, and the nature of the crimes shocked the local community.\n\nModus Operandi[]\n\nCollins' modus operandi involved abducting, sexually assaulting, and brutally murdering his victims. The crimes were marked by a disturbing pattern of violence and showed signs of sadistic tendencies. The brutality of the murders added to the terror that gripped the community during that period.\n\nArrest and Trial[]\n\nCollins was arrested in July 1969, following the discovery of evidence linking him to the crimes. In 1970, he stood trial for the murder of Karen Sue Beineman. Despite maintaining his innocence, Collins was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nVictims[]\n\nConfirmed victims[]\n\nName Age Disappeared Body Found Cause of Death\n\nSuspected victims[]\n\nName Age Disappeared Body Found Cause of Death\n\nTimeline[]\n\nBibliography[]\n\nLiterature[]\n\nArticles[]\n\nDocumentaries[]\n\nTelevision[]\n\nYouTube Documentaries[]\n\nPodcasts[]\n\nJohn Norman Collins - Part 1.
