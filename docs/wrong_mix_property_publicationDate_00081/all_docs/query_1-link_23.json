        "text": "John C. Norman, age 77, passed away suddenly on February 2, 2024, at Baptist Health South in Jacksonville, FL. He was born on November 15, 1946, in Lawtey, FL to Leonard and Sarah Pagett Norman. After graduating from high school, he joined the US Army and proudly served his country for two years. Following his military service, John embarked on a long and fulfilling career as a Correctional Officer at Union Correctional Institution. He faithfully carried out his duties for over 37 years until his well-deserved retirement in 2003.\n\nOutside of work, John loved spending time outdoors hunting and fishing. He also found solace in listening to bluegrass and gospel music that touched his soul. One of John's greatest passions was working on home projects, particularly anything mechanical. His hands were always busy fixing things around the house or lending a helping hand to friends and family. Described as outgoing and witty, John had an endearing presence among friends and family. He was also a faithful member of Fellowship Baptist Church.\n\nJohn is survived by his loving wife of many years, Linda Norman and his two daughters; Donna (JJ) Harvey and Jennifer (Don) Andrews; his siblings Floyd \"Bud\" (Beadie Mae) Norman and Rachel Prescott; and took pride in being a Papa to his two grandchildren, Taylor Andrews and Chase Shadd. John was preceded in death by his parents, Leonard and Sarah Norman, as well as his siblings Carl Norman and Evelyn Griffis.\n\nA service to honor John's life will be held at 11:00am on February 6, 2024, at his church, Fellowship Baptist Church in Raiford, FL. A visitation time will begin an hour prior at 10:00am. John will be laid to rest immediately following the service at Highland First Baptist Church Cemetery in Lawtey with military honors. Arrangements are under the care and direction of Archer-Milton Funeral Home. 386-496-2008 www.archerfuneralhome.com"
