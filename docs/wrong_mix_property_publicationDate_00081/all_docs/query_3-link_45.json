        "text": "Violet Ferguson, who graduated last year, was one of those students.\n\n“He found a way to make every single person in the school feel special and feel wanted and feel like part of the community.” Ferguson said, “He made you feel like he truly knew not just you, but your soul. And found a way to make you feel like you were part of God’s mission.”\n\nKatie Owen teaches at Lexington Catholic High School where Fr. Norman served as chaplain. She called him an “incredible shepherd.”\n\n“Father Norm was the kind of guy that every time he walked in the room, light just followed him.”\n\nMathew George, Principal of Lexington Catholic said Father Norman was more than a parish priest.\n\n“He could connect with people, even on the street that he didn’t know. He will be a loss to our students, our faculty, our staff, our alums. Our entire community.”\n\nAnd George added that Fr. Norman’s gifts went far beyond ministry.\n\n“He had many talents that people knew about, didn’t know about you know?” George continued, “his singing, his painting, his just way with words, working with other people. It was phenomenal that the gifts he was able to share with us in his 50 years here.”\n\nFuneral arrangements are still pending, but a memorial service for the Lexington Catholic family including alumni and members of Fr. Norman’s parish, St. Peter Claver Catholic Church will be held at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday at Lexington Catholic High School."
