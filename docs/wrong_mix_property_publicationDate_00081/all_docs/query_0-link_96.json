        "text": "Assassin of GorAssassin of Gor By : John Norman Chronicles of Counter-Earth Volume 5 Kuurus Kuurus, of the Caste of Assassins, crouched on the crest of the small hill, leaning with both hands on the shaft of his spear, looking down into the shallow valley, waiting. He would not yet be welcome. In the distance he could see the white walls, and some of the towers of the city of Ko-ro-ba, which was being rebuilt. It is an old word in Gorean, Ko-ro-ba, meaning a village market, though few considered its archaic meaning. Kuurus looked on the city. It had once been destroyed by Priest-Kings, but now it was being rebuilt. Kuurus was not much interested in such matters. His was the Caste of Assassins. He had been called to this place. In the early part of the eighth Gorean hour the distant white walls took the sun and blazed like light in the green hills. The Towers of the Morning, thought Kuurus, the Towers of the Morning. The Assassin shifted a bit and turned his attention again to the valley, when the men below were almost ready. The logs had been prepared and carefully placed. There were hundreds of them, trimmed and squared, mostly of Ka-la-na wood, from the sweet-smelling wine trees of Gor. They crossed one another in the intricate traditional patterns, spaces between to permit the rush of air, forming a carefully structured, tiered, truncated pyramid. Kuurus observed, curious, as the last log was placed by two men in the red of Warriors. Then free women, veiled and in Robes of Concealment, each carrying a jar or canister, approached the structure. Even from where Kuurus waited he could smell the perfumed oils, the unguents and spices, which the women, climbing and moving about the pyramid slowly, as though on stairs, sprinkled about or poured over the wood. Beyond the wood, toward the city, Kuurus could see the procession. He was surprised for, judging from the colors of the garments of those who marched, it contained men of many castes, perhaps all castes of the city, only that he did not see among them the white of the Caste of Initiates. That puzzled Kuurus, for normally men of the Initiates are prominent in such events. These men of Ko-ro-ba, he knew, when their city had been destroyed by the Priest-Kings, had been scattered to the ends of Gor but, when permitted by the Priest-Kings, they had returned to their city to rebuild it, each bearing a stone to add to its walls. It was said, in the time of troubles, that the Home Stone had not been lost, and it had not. And even Kuurus, of the Caste of Assassins, knew that a city cannot die while its Home Stone survives. Kuurus, who would think little of men on the whole, yet could not despise such men as these, these of Ko-ro-ba. The procession did not chant, nor sing, for this was not a time for such things, nor did it carry boughs of Ka-la-na, nor were the sounds of the sista or tambor heard in the sunlight that morning. At such a time as this Goreans do not sing\n\nnor speak. They are silent, for at such a time words mean nothing, and would demean or insult; in such a time there can be for Goreans only silence, memory and fire. The procession was led by four Warriors, who supported on their shoulders a framework of crossed spears, lashed together, on which, wrapped in the scarlet leather of a tarnsman, lay the body. Kuurus watched, unmoved, as the four Warriors carried their scarlet burden to the height of the huge, sweet-smelling, oil-impregnated pyre. Averting their eyes the Warriors threw back the scarlet leather that the body might lie free on the spears, open to the wind and sun. He was a large man, Kuurus noted, in the leather of a Warrior. The hair, he remarked, was unusual. The procession and those who had been earlier at the pyre now stood back from it, some fifty yards or so, for the oil-impregnated wood will take the torch quickly and fiercely. There were three who stood near the pyre; one wore the brown robes of the Administrator of a City, the humblest robes in the city, and was hooded; another wore the blue of the Caste of Scribes, a small man, almost tiny, bent now with pain and grief; the last was a very large man, broad of back and shoulder, bearded and with long blond hair, a Warrior; yet even the Warrior seemed in that moment shaken. Kuurus saw the torch lit and then, with a cry of pain, thrown by the Warrior onto the small mountain of oiled wood. The wood leaped suddenly alive with a blaze that was almost a burst of fire and the three men staggered backward, their forearms thrown across their eyes. Kuurus bent down and picked up a stalk of grass and chewed on it, watching. The reflection of the fire, even in the sunlight, could be seen on his face. His forehead began to sweat. He blinked his eyes against the heat. The men and women of Ko-ro-ba stood circled about the pyre, neither moving nor speaking, for better than two Ahn. After about half an Ahn the pyre, still fearful with heat and light, had collapsed with a roar, forming a great, fiercely burning mound of oil-soaked wood. At last, when the wood burned only here and there, and what had been the pyre was mostly ashes and glowing wood, the men of a dozen castes, each carrying a jar of chilled wine, moved about, pouring the wine over the fire, quenching it. Other men sought in the ashes for what might be found of the Warrior. Some bones and some whitish ash they gathered in white linen and placed in an urn of red and yellow glass. Kuurus knew that such an urn would be decorated, probably, since the man had been a Warrior, with scenes of the hunt and war. The urn was given to him who wore the robes of the Administrator of the City, who took it and slowly, on foot, withdrew toward Ko-ro-ba, followed by the large blond Warrior and the small Scribe. The ashes, Kuurus judged, since the body had been wrapped in the scarlet leather of a tarnsman, would be scattered from tarnback, perhaps over distant Thassa, the sea. Kuurus stood up and stretched. He picked up his short sword in its scabbard, his helmet and his shield. These he slung over his left shoulder. Then he picked up his spear, and stood there, against the sky, on the crest of the hill, in the black tunic. Those who had come to the pyre had now withdrawn slowly toward the city. Only\n\none man remained near the smoking wood. He wore a black robe with a stripe of white down the front and back. Kuurus knew that it would be this man, who wore the black, but not the full black, of the Assassin, who would deal with him. Kuurus smiled bitterly to himself. He laughed at the stripe of white. Their tunic, said Kuurus to himself, is as black as mine. When the man near the smoking wood turned to face him, Kuurus descended the hill. He was now welcome. Kuurus smiled to himself. The man did not greet him, nor did Kuurus lift his hand to the man, palm inward, saying \"Tal.\" The man was a strange man, thought Kuurus. His head was totally devoid of hair, even to the lack of eyebrows. Perhaps he is some sort of Initiate, thought Kuurus. Without speaking the man took twenty pieces of gold, tarn disks of Ar, of double weight, and gave them to Kuurus, who placed them in the pockets of his belt. The Assassins, unlike most castes, do not carry pouches. Kuurus looked curiously down at the remains of the pyre. Only a bit o fwood now, here and there, missed by the chilled wine, clung to flame; some of the logs, however, still smoked, and the others held as though within themselves the redness of the fire they remembered; but most were simply charred, now dead, stained with the oil, wet from the wine. \"Justice must be done,\" said the man. Kuurus said nothing, but only looked at the man. Often, though not always, they spoke of justice. It pleases them to speak of justice, he said to himself. And of right. It eases them and gives them peace. There is no such thing as justice, said Kuurus, to himself. There is only gold and steel. \"Whom am I to kill?\" asked Kuurus. \"I do not know,\" said the man. Kuurus looked at him angrily. Yet he had in the pockets of his belt twenty gold tarn disks, and of double weight. There must be more. \"All we know is this,\" said the man, handing him a greenish patch. Kuurus studied the patch. \"It is a faction patch,\" said he. \"It speaks to me of the tarn races of Ar.\" \"It is true,\" said the man. The faction patches are worn in Ar by those who favor a given faction in the racing. There are several such factions, who control the racing and compete among themselves, the greens, the reds, the golds, the yellows, the silvers. \"I shall go to Ar,\" said Kuurus. \"If you are successful,\" said the man, \"return and you will receive a hundred such pieces of gold.\" Kuurus looked at him. \"If it is not true,\" he said, \"you will die.\" \"It is true,\" said the man. \"Who is it,\" asked Kuurus, \"that was slain? Who is it that I am to avenge?\" \"A Warrior,\" said the man. \"His name?\" asked Kuurus. \"Tarl Cabot,\" said the man. Chapter 2: Ar Kuurus, of the Caste of Assassins, entered the great gate of Ar. Guardsman did not detain him, for he wore on his forehead the mark of the\n\nblack dagger. Not for many years had the black tunic of the Assassins been seen within the walls of Ar, not since the siege of that city in 10,110 from its founding, in the days of Marlenus, who had been Ubar; of Pa-Kur, who had been Master of the Assassins; and of the Ko-ro-ban Warrior, in the songs called Tarl of Bristol. For years the black of the Assassins had been outlawed in the city. Pa-Kur, who had been Master of the Assassins, had led a league of tributary cities to attack Imperial Ar in the time when its Home Stone had been stolen and its Ubar forced to flee. The city had fallen and Pa-Kir, though of low caste, had aspired to inherit the imperial mantle of Marlenus, had dared to lift his eyes to the throne of Empire and place about his neck the golden medallion of a Ubar, a thing forbidden to such as he in the myths of the Counter-Earth. Pa-Kur's horde had been defeated by an alliance of free cities, led by Ko-ro-ba and Thentis, under the command of Matthew Cabot of Ko-ro-ba, the father of Tarl of Bristol, and Kazrak of Port Kar, sword brother of the same Warrior. Tarl of Bristol himself on the windy height of Ar's Cylinder of Justice had defeated Pa-Kur, Master of the Assassins. From that time the black of the Assassins had not been seen in the streets of Glorious Ar. Yet none would stand in the way of Kuurus for he wore on his forehead, small and fine, the sign of the black dagger. When he of the Caste of Assassins has been paid his gold and has received his charge he affixes on his forehead that sign, that he may enter whatever city he pleases, that none may interfere with his work. There are few men who have done great wrong or who have powerful, rich enemies who do not tremble upon learning that one has been brought to their city who wears the dagger. Kuurus stepped between the great gates and looked about himself. A woman carrying a market basket moved to one side, watching him, that she might not touch him, holding a child to her. A peasant moved away that the shadow of the Assassin might not fall across his own. Kuurus pointed to a fruit on a flat-topped wagon with wooden wheels, drawn by a small four-legged, horned tharlarion. The peddler pressed the fruit into his hands and hurried on, not meeting his eyes. Her back against the bricks of a tower near the gate, a slender, slim-ankled slave girl stood, watching him. Her eyes were frightened. Kuurus was apparently the first of the Caste of Assassins she had seen. Her hair was dark, and fell to the small of her back; her eyes were dark; she wore the briefly skirted, sleeveless slave livery common in the northern cities of Gor; the livery was yellow and split to the cord that served her as belt; about her throat she wore a matching collar, yellow enameled over steel. Biting into the fruit, the juice running at the side of his mouth, Kuurus studied the girl. It seemed she would turn to leave but his eyes held her\n\nwhere she stood. He spit some seeds to the dust of the street within the gate. When he had finished he threw the core of the fruit to her feet and she looked down at it with horror. When she looked up, frightened, she felt his hand on her left arm. He turned her about and thrust her down a side street, making her walk in front of him. At a Paga Tavern, one near the great gate, cheap and crowded, dingy and smelling, a place frequented by strangers and small Merchants, the Assassin took the girl by the arm and thrust her within. Those in the tavern looked up from the low tables. There were three Musicians against one wall. They stopped playing. The slave girls in Pleasure Silk turned and stood stock still, the Paga flasks cradled over their right forearms. Not even the bells locked to their left ankles made a sound. Not a paga bowl was lifted nor a hand moved. The men looked at the Assassin, who regarded them, one by one. Men turned white under that gaze. Some fled from the tables, lest, unknown to themselves, it be they for whom this man wore the mark of the black dagger. The Assassin turned to the man in a black apron, a fat, grimy man, who wore a soiled tunic of white and gold, stained with sweat and spilled paga. \"Collar,\" said the Assassin. The man took a key from a line of hooks on the wall behind him. \"Seven,\" he said, throwing the Assassin the key. The Assassin caught the key and taking the girl by the arm led her to a dark wall, in a low-ceilinged corner of the sloping room. She moved woodenly, as though numb. Her eyes seemed frightened. There were one or two other girls there, kneeling, who drew back, with a sound of chain. He thrust the dark-haired girl to her knees by the seventh collar and snapped it about her neck, turning the key, locking it. It gave her about a two-foot length of chain, fastened to a slave ring bolted into the stone. Then he looked down on her. Her eyes were lifted to his, frightened. The yellow of her livery seemed dark in the shadows. From where she knelt she could see the low-hanging tharlarion oil lamps of the main portion of the Paga tavern, the men, the girls in silk who, in a moment, belled, would move among them, replenishing the paga. In the center of the tables, under a hanging lamp, there was a square area, recessed, filled with sand, in which men might fight or girls dance. Beyond the area of the sand and the many tables there was a high wall, some twenty feet or so high, in which there were four levels, each containing seven small curtained alcoves, the entrances to which were circular, with a diameter of about twenty-four inches. Seven narrow ladders, each about eight inches in width, fixed into the wall, gave access to these alcoves. She saw Kuurus go to the tables and sit cross-legged behind one, a table against the wall on her left, that there might be no tables behind him, but only the wall. The men who had been at that table, or near it, silently rose and left\n\nthe area. Kuurus had placed his spear against the wall behind him, and he had taken from his left shoulder his shield, his helmet and the sheathed short sword, which blade he had placed at his right hand on the low table. At a gesture from the proprietor, the grimy man in the tunic of white and gold, one of the serving slaves, with a flash of ankle bells, hurried to the Assassin and set before him a bowl, which she trembling filled from the flask held over her right forearm. Then, with a furtive glance at the girl chained at the side of the room, the serving slave hurried away. Kuurus took the paga bowl in both hands and put his head down, looking into it. Then, somberly, he lifted it to his lips and drank. Putting the bowl down he wiped his mouth on his forearm and looked at the Musicians. \"Play,\" he said. The three Musicians bent to their instruments, and, in a moment, there were again sounds of a paga tavern, the sounds of talk, of barbaric music, of pouring paga, the clink of bowls, the rustle of bells on the ankles of slave girls. Scarcely a quarter of an Ahn had passed and the men who drank in that room had forgotten, as is the way of men, that a dark one sat with them in that room, one who wore the black tunic of the Caste of Assassins, who silently drank with them. It was enough for them that he who sat with them did not this time wear for them the mark of the black dagger on his forehead, that it was not they whom he sought. Kuurus drank, watching them, his face showing no emotion. Suddenly a small figure burst through the door of the tavern, stumbling and rolling down the stairs, crying out. It bounded to its feet, like a small, hunched animal, with a large head and wild brown hair. One eye was larger than the other. It could stand, even if it straightened, no higher than a man's waist. \"Do not hurt Hup!\" it cried. \"Do not hurt Hup!\" \"It is Hup the Fool,\" said someone. The little thing, misshapen with its large head, scrambled limping and leaping like a broken-legged urt to the counter behind which stood the man in the grimy tunic, who was wiping out a paga bowl. \"Hide Hup!\" cried the thing. \"Hide Hup! Please hide Hup!\" \"Be off with you, Hup the Fool!\" cried the man slapping at him with the back of his hand. \"No!\" screamed Hup. \"They want to kill Hup!\" \"There is no place for beggars in Glorious Ar,\" growled one of the men at the tables. Hup's rag might once have been of the Caste of Potters, but it was difficult to tell. His hands looked as though they might have been broken. Clearly one leg was shorter than the other. Hup wrung his tiny, misshapen hands, looking about. He tried foolishly to hide behind a group of men but they threw him to the center of the pit of sand in the tavern. He tried, like a frantic animal, to crawl under one of the low tables but he only spilled the paga and the men pulled him out from under the table and belabored his back with blows of their fists. He kept whimpering and screaming, and running one place or the other.\n\nThen, in spite of the angry shout of the proprietor, he scrambled over the counter, taking refuge behind it. The men in the tavern, with the exception of Kuurus, laughed. Then, a moment later, four men, armed, brawny men, with a streamer of blue and yellow silk sewn diagonally into their garments, burst through the door and entered the room. \"Where is Hup the Fool?\" cried their leader, a large fellow with missing teeth and a scar over his right eye. The men began to hunt about the room, angrily. \"Where is Hup the Fool?\" demanded the leader of the four men of the proprietor. \"I shall have to look around for him,\" said the proprietor, winking at the fellow with missing teeth, who grinned. \"No,\" said the proprietor, apparently looking about with great care behind the counter, \"Hup the Fool does not seem to be here.\" \"It looks like we must search elsewhere,\" said the leader of the four men, attempting to sound disappointed. \"It appears so,\" said the proprietor. Then, after a cruel pause, the proprietor suddenly cried out. \"No! Wait! Here is something!\" And, reaching down to his feet behind the counter, picked up the small animal mass that was Hup the Fool, which shrieked with fear, and hurled it into the arms of the man with missing teeth, who laughed. \"Why,\" cried the man with missing teeth, \"it is he! It is Hup the Fool!\" \"Mercy, Masters!\" cried Hup, squealing, struggling in the grasp of his captor. The other three men, hired sworks, perhaps once of the Caste of Warriors, laughed at the frantic efforts of the tiny, sniveling wad of flesh to free itself. Many in the crowd laughed at the small fool's discomfort. Hup was indeed an ugly thing, for he was small, and yet thick, almost bulbous, and under the dirty tunic, perhaps that of the potters, there bulged the hump of some grotesque growth. One of his legs was shorter thatn the other; his head was too large for his body, and swollen to the left; one eye was larger than the other. His tiny feet thrashed about, kicking at the man who held him. \"Are you truly going to kill him?\" asked one of the patrons at the low table. \"This time he dies,\" said the man who held Hup. \"He has dared to speak the name of Portus and beg a coin from him.\" Goreans do not generally favor begging, and some regard it as an insult that there should be such, an insult to them and their city. When charity is in order, as when a man cannot work or a woman is alone, usually such is arranged through the caste organization, but sometimes through the clan, which is not specifically caste oriented but depends on ties of blood through the fifth degree. If one, of course, finds oneself in effect without caste or clan, as was perhaps the case with the small fool named Hup, and one cannot work, one's life is likely to be miserable and not of great length. Moreover, Goreans are extremely sensitive about names, and who may speak them. Indeed, some, particularly those of low caste, even have use names, concealing their true names, lest they be discovered by enemies and used to conjure spells against them. Similarly, slaves, on the whole, do not address free men by their names. Kuurus surmised that Portus, doubtless a man of importance, had been troubled\n\nby the little fool Hup on more than one occasion, and had now decided to do away with him. The man who held the sniveling Hup held him with one hand and struck him with the other, and then threw him to one of his three fellows, who similarly abused him. The crowd in the tavern reacted with amusement as the small, animal-like body was buffeted and thrown about, sometimes flung against the wall or on the tables. At last, bleeding and scarcely able to whine, Hup curled himself into a small, trembling ball, his head between his legs, his hands holding his ankles. The four men, then having him between them in the pit of sand, kicked him again and again. Then the large man with missing teeth seized Hup's hair and pulled up the head, to expose the throat, holding in his right hand a small, thick, curved blade, the hook knife of Ar, used sheathed in the sport of that name, but the knife was not now sheathed. The eyes of tiny Hup were screwed shut, his body shivering like that of an urt clenched in the teeth of a sleen. \"Keep him on the sand!\" warned the proprietor of the tavern. He with the missing teeth laughed and looked about the crowd, his eyes bright, seeing that they waited with eagerness for his stroke. But his laugh died in his throat as he looked into the eyes of Kuurus, he of the Caste of Assassins. Kuurus, with his left hand, pushed to one side his bowl of paga. Hup opened his eyes, startled at not yet having felt the deep, cruel movement of the steel. He too looked into the eyes of Kuurus, who sat in the darkness, the wall behind him, cross-legged, looking at him, no emotion on his face. \"You are a beggar?\" asked Kuurus. \"Yes, Master,\" said Hup. \"Was the begging good today?\" asked Kuurus. Hup looked at him in fear. \"Yes, Master,\" he said, \"yes!\" \"Then you have money,\" said Kuurus, and stood up behind the table, slinging the sheath of the short sword about his shoulder. Hup wildly thrust a small, stubby, knobby hand into his pouch and hurled a coin, a copper tarsk, to Kuurus, who caught it and placed it in one of the pockets of his belt. \"Do not interfere,\" snarled the man who held the hook knife. \"There are four of us,\" said another, putting his hand on his sword. \"I have taken money,\" said Kuurus. The men in the tavern, and the girls, began to move away from the tables. \"We are Warriors,\" said another. Then a coin of gold struck the table before the Assassin, ringing on the wood. All eyes turned to face a paunchy man, in a robe of blue and yellow silk. \"I am Portus,\" he said. \"Do not interfere, Assassin.\"\n\nKuurus picked up the coin and fingered it, and then he looked at Portus. \"I have already taken money,\" he said. Portus gasped. The four Warriors rose to their feet. Five blades leaped from the sheath with but one sound. Hup, whining, crawled away from the sand on his hands and knees. The first Warrior lunged toward the Assassin but in the darkness of the side of the room, in the dim light of the tharlarion lamps, it was difficult to tell what happened. No one heard the striking of sword steel, but all saw the turning body of the man with the missing teeth falling sprawled over the low table. Then the dark shape of the Assassin seemed to move like a swift shadow in the room, and each of the three Warriors leaped toward him, but seemed to fail to find him, and another man, without even the flash of sword steel, dropped to his knees and fell forward in the pit of sand; the other two men struck as well, but their blades did not even meet that of the Assassin, who did not seem to deign to cross steel with them; the third man, soundlessly, turned away from the blade of the Assassin, seeming surprised, took two steps and fell; the fourth man had fallen, the shadow had resheathed its blade. Now the Assassin picked up the coin of gold and looked at the startled and sweating Portus. Then the Assassin threw the coin to the feet of Hup the Fool. \"A gift to Hup the Fool,\" said the Assassin, \"from Portus, who is kind.\" Hup seized up the coin of gold and scrambled from the room, like an urt running through the open gate of a trap. Kuurus returned to his table, and sat down cross-legged as before. Once more the short sword lay at his right hand on the table. He lifted his paga bowl and drank. Kuurus had not finished the bowl of paga when he sensed a man approaching. The right hand of Kuurus now lay on the hilt of the short sword. The man was Portus, heavy, paunchy, in blue and yellow silk. He approached gingerly, his hands open, held from his body, ingratiatingly, smiling. He sat down, wheezing, across from Kuurus, and placed his hands deliberately on his knees. Kuurus said nothing but observed him. The man smiled, but Kuurus did not smile. \"Welcome, Killer,\" said the man, addressing the Assassin by what, for that caste, is a title of respect. Kuurus did not move. \"I see you wear on your forehead,\" said the man, \"the dagger.\" Kuurus examined him, the paunchy flesh beneath the blue and yellow silken robe. He noted the hang of the garment on the man's right arm. The short sword moved from the sheath. \"I must protect myself,\" said the man, smiling, as the blade of Kuurus lifted itself through the sleeve, parting the silk, revealing the sheath strapped to his forearm. Not taking his eyes from the man, Kuurus cut the straps on the sheath from the man's forearm, and with a small movement of his blade, threw the sheath and\n\nits dagger some feet to the side. \"I am of the opinion,\" said the man, \"that it is a good thing we have those in the black tunic back amongst us. Kuurus nodded, accepting the judgement. \"Bring paga!\" called the paunchy man imperiously, impatiently, to one of the girls, who hastened to obey him. Then he turned again to Kuurs, and smiled ingratiatingly. \"It has been hard in Ar,\" said the man, \"since the deposition of Kazrak of Port Kar as Administrator of the City, and since the murder of Om, the High Initiate of the City.\" Kuurus had heard of these things. Kazrak, who had been Administrator of the City for several years, had finally been deposed, largely due to the agitations of certain factions among the Initiates and Merchants, who had had their various grievances against the Administrator. Kazrak had offended the Caste of Initiates primarily by levying taxes on their vast holdings throughout the city and upon occasion upholding the rulings of the administrative courts over the courts of the Initiates. The Initiates, in the interpretations of sacrifices and in their preachments, primarily to the low castes, had led many of the city to fear that Kazrak might not long enjoy the favor of the Priest-Kings. After the murder of Om, who had been on tolerable terms with the Administrator, the new High Initiate, Complicius Serenus, in studying the omens of the white bosk slain at the Harvest Feast had, to his apparent horror, discovered that they had stood against Kazrak. Other Initiates wished to examine these omens, being read in the state of the bosk's liver, but Complicius Serenus, as though in terror, had cast the liver into the fire, presumably that such dark portents might be immediately destroyed. He had then collapsed weeping on the pillar of sacrifice, for it was well known that he had been a beloved friend of the Administrator. It was from this time that Kazrak might clearly have been said, particularly among the lower castes, to have lost the confidence of the city. He was Further in danger by virtue of his controlling measures restricting certain monopolies important to certain factions among the Merchants, in particular those have to do with the manufacture of bricks, and the distribution of salt and tharlarion oil. He had further imposed restrictions on the games and contests of Ar, such that the loss of life had become infrequent, even among competing slaves. It was argued that the citizens of Ar could scarcely remain strong and fearless unless accustomed to the sight of blood, of danger and death. And since Kazrak was originally, perhaps surprisingly, of Port Kar, a city not on particularly good terms with Ar, or any other Gorean city, there was the hint of sedition in such matters. Moreover, Kazrak had been one of the leaders of the forces that had preserved Ar in the time of its troubles with Pa-Kur, master of the Assassins; as the tale was now told in the streets, the men of Ar themselves, alone, had overthrown the invader; Kazrak seemed a living reminder that Glorious Ar had once needed the aid of other cities, and men other than her own.\n\nWhereas it is only the men of high caste who elect members to the Council of the City, the gold of merchants and the will of the general populace is seldom disregarded in their choices. Accordingly, Kazrak of Port Kar, for years Administrator of Ar, was by vote deposed and banished from the city, being publicly denied salt, bread and fire, as had been Marlenus, long years before him, once Ubar of Ar. Kazrak, with loyal followers, and the beautiful Sana of Thentis, his consort, had left the city months before. Their whereabouts were unknown, but it was thought they had hoped to found a colony on one of the islands of Thassa, farther north than even Cos and Tyros. The new Administrator of Ar was a man named Minus Tentius Hinrabius, an unimportant man except for being of the Hinrabian family, prominent among the Builders, having the major holdings in the vast, walled Hinrabian kilns, where much of Ar's brick is produced. \"It is hard in Ar,\" said the paunchy man, Portus, \"since Kazrak has gone.\" Kuurus said nothing. \"There seems little law now,\" said Portus. \"When one goes out at night, even on the high bridges, one must have men with one. It is not well to walk among the cylinders after dark without torches and steel.\" \"Do the Warriors no longer guard the streets?\" asked Kuurus. \"Some,\" said Portus. \"But not enough. Many are engaged in the border disputes as far distant as the Cartius. Moreover, the caravans of Merchants are now given large and free guard.\" \"Surely there are many Warriors in the city,\" said Kuurus. \"Yes,\" said Portus, \"but they do little----they are well paid, more than twice what was done before, but they spend the mornings in practices with arms, and the afternoons and evenings in the taverns, the gaming rooms and baths of the city.\" \"There are swords for hire?\" asked Kuurus. \"Yes,\" said Portus, \"and the rich Merchants, and the great houses, those on the Street of Coins, and on the Street of Brands, hire their own men.\" He smiled. \"Further,\" said he, \"Merchants arm and train squads of such men and rent them, for high wages, to the citizens of given streets and cylinders.\" Kuurus lifted his paga bowl and drank. \"What has this to do with me?\" he asked. \"For whom do you wear on your forehead the mark of the black dagger?\" queried Portus discreetly. Kuurus said nothing. \"Perhaps I could tell you where to find him,\" proposed Portus. \"I will find him,\" said Kuurus. \"Of course,\" said Portus. \"Of course.\" The heavy man, sitting cross-legged, opposite the Assassin, began to sweat, fiddled with the damp blue and yellow silk covering his knee, and then with a nervous hand lifted a shaking bowl of paga to his lips, spilling some down the side of his face. \"I meant no harm,\" he said. \"You are alive,\" said Kuurus. \"May I ask, Killer,\" asked Portus, \"if you come to make the first killing---or the second?\" \"The second,\" said Kuurus. \"Ah!\" said Portus. \"I hunt,\" said Kuurus.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Portus. \"I come to avenge,\" said Kuurus. Portus smiled. \"That is what I meant,\" he said, \"that it is good those in the black tunic are once again amongst us, that justice can be done, order restored, right upheld.\" Kuurus looked at him, the eyes not smiling. \"There is only gold and steel,\" said he. \"Of course,\" hastily agreed Portus. \"That is very true.\" \"Why did you come to speak with me?\" \"I would hire a sword such as yours,\" said Portus. \"I hunt,\" said Kuurus. \"Ar is a vast city,\" said Portus. \"Perhaps it will take you time to find he whom you seek.\" Kuurus' eyes flickered. Portus leaned forward. \"And meanwhile,\" he said, \"you might earn considerable sums. I have work for such men as you. And much of the time you would be free, to hunt as you wished. Matters might well work out to our mutual advantage.\" \"Who are you?\" asked Kuurus. \"I am that Portus,\" said he, \"who is Master of the House of Portus.\" Kuurus had heard of the House of Portus, one of the largest of the slave houses in the Street of Brands. He had known, of course, from the gown of blue and yellow silk that the man was a slaver. \"What is it that you fear?\" asked Kuurus. \"There is a house greater than mine, or any on the Street of Brands,\" said he. \"You fear this house?\" asked Kuurus. \"Those of this house stand near the Administrator, and the High Initiate,\" said Portus. \"What do you mean?\" asked Kuurus. \"The gold of this house is heavy in the councils of the city.\" \"The Administrator and the High Initiate,\" asked Kuurus, \"owe their thrones to the gold of this house?\" Portus laughed bitterly. \"Without the gold of this house, how could the Administrator and the High Initiate have sponsored the races and the games that won them the favor of the lower castes?\" \"But the lower castes do not elect the Administrator or the High Initiate,\" said Kuurus. \"The Administrator is appointed by the High Council of the City and the High Initiate by the High Council of the Initiates of the City.\" \"These councils,\" said Portus scornfully, \"know well the way the lower castes yelp in the tiers.\" He snorted. \"And there are many in the High Councils of the City who, if forced to decide between the steel of the hook knife and the feel of gold in their pouch, will choose gold to steel.\" Portus winked at Kuurus. \"There is only gold and steel,\" he said. Kuurus did not smile. Portus hastily pushed his paga bowl up to his mouth, and swilled again, his eyes wary of the Assassin across from him. \"Where does this house obtain riches such that they may so easily outbid all other factions in Ar?\"\n\n\"It is a rich house,\" said Portus, looking about himself. \"It is a rich house.\" \"That rich?\" asked Kuurus. \"I do not know where the gold comes from---all of it---,\" said Portus. \"My own house could not begin to sponsor the games of even two days---we would be bankrupt.\" \"Of what interest is this house to you?\" asked Kuurus. \"It wants to be the single slave house of Ar,\" whispered Portus. Kuurus smiled. \"My house,\" said Portus, \"is twenty generations old. We have bred, captured, trained, exchanged and sold slaves for half a millenium. The house of Portus is known on all Gor.\" Portus looked down. \"Already six houses on the Street of Brands have been purchased or closed.\" \"There has never been a monopoly on slaves in Ar,\" said Kuurus. \"That is the wish, however, of the house of which I speak,\" said Portus. \"Does it not offend you? Are you not outraged? Even in terms of merchandise and prices cannot you see what it would mean? Even now the lesser houses find it difficult to acquire premium slaves, and when we obtain them, we are undersold. Few go to the lesser houses to buy slaves this year in Ar.\" \"How can this house of which you speak,\" asked Kuurus, \"undersell so consistently? Is it that the number of slaves is so great that the profit taken on each is less?\" \"I have thought long on it,\" said Portus, \"and that cannot be all of it. I know this business well, the costs of information, organization, planning, acquisition, transportation and security, the care and feeding and training of the animals, the guards, the costs of the auctions, the taxes on sales, the deliveries to distant cities---and the staff of the house I speak of is large, skilled and highly paid---and their facilities are unparalleled in the City, both in size and appointments. They have interior baths which could rival the pools even of the Capacian Baths.\" Portus nodded in puzzlement. \"No,\" said Portus, \"they must have sources of gold other than the income on their merchandise.\" Portus pushed one finger around in a puddle of splashed paga on the low table. \"I thought for a time,\" he said, \"that they intended to sell at a radical loss until the other slave houses were forced to close, and then recoup their losses with profit by setting their own prices---but then when I considered again the gold which sponsored the games and races honoring the men who were to become Administrator and High Initiate, I decided it could not be. I am convinced the house of which I speak has major sources of gold other than the income on their merchandise.\" Kuurus did not speak. \"There is another strange thing about that house I do not understand,\" said Portus. \"What?\" asked Kuurus. \"The number of barbarian women they place on the block,\" said Portus. \"There have always been barbarian women on Gor,\" said Kuurus, dismissing the remark of Portus. \"Not in such numbers,\" grumbled Portus. He looked at Kuurus. \"Have you any\n\nidea of the expense of acquiring a barbarian woman from beyond the cities---the distances involved? Normally they can be brought in only one at a time, on tarnback. A caravan of common slave wagons would take a year to go beyond the cities and return.\" \"A hundred tarnsmen, well organized,\" said Kuurus, \"could strike barbarian villages, bind a hundred wenches, and return in twenty days.\" \"True,\" said Portus, \"but commonly such raids take place on cylinders in given cities---the distances beyond the cities are great, and the prices paid for mere barbarian girls are less.\" Kuurus shrugged. \"Moreover,\" said Portus, \"these are not common barbarian wenches.\" Kuurus looked up. \"Few of them have even a smattering of Gorean,\" he said. \"And they act strangely. They beg and weep and whine. One would think they had never seen a slave collar or slave chains before. They are beautiful, but they are stupid. The only thing they understand is the whip.\" Portus looked down, disgusted. \"Men even go to see them sold, out of curiosity, for they either stand there, numb, not moving, or scream and fight, or cry out in their barbarian tongues.\" Portus looked up. \"But the lash teaches them what is expected of them on the block, and they then present themselves well---and some bring fair prices---in spite of being barbarian.\" \"I gather,\" said Kuurus, \"that you wish to hire my sword, that you may in some degree protect yourself from the men and the plans of the house of which you have spoken.\" \"It is true,\" said Portus. \"When gold will not do, only steel can meet steel.\" \"You say that this house of which you speak is the largest and richest, the most powerful, on the Street of Brands?\" \"Yes,\" said Portus. \"What is the name of this house?\" asked Kuurus. \"The House of Cernus,\" said Portus. \"I shall permit my sword to be hired,\" said Kuurus. \"Good!\" cried Portus, his hands on the table, his eyes gleaming. \"Good!\" \"By the House of Cernus,\" said the assassin. The eyes of Portus went wide, and his body trembled. He rose unsteadily to his feet, and staggered backwards, shaking his head, turned, and stumbled over one of the low tables, and fled from the room. His drink finished, Kurrus rose and went to the darkened corner of the room, where the wall sloped down. He looked into the eyes of the girl in the yellow slave livery, who knelt there. Then he turned the key in the lock of collar seven and released her. Thrusting her to her feet and forcing her to walk before him, he went to the counter, behind which stood the man in the grimy tunic of white and gold. Kuurus threw the key to him. \"Use twenty-seven,\" said the man, handing Kuurus a bit of silk, Pleasure Silk, wrapped about a set of slave chains. Kuurs threw the silk and chains over his shoulder and motioned the girl to move ahead of him and, numbly, she did so, crossing the room, going between the tables, and stopping before the narrow ladder at the right side of the high wall, in which were found the ledges with their alcoves. Not speaking, but woodenly, she climbed the ladder and crawled onto the shelf near the tiny\n\nalcove marked with the Gorean equivalent of twenty-seven and entered, followed by Kuurus, who drew the curtains behind them. The alcove, with its enclosing, curved walls, was only about four feet high and five feet wide. It was lit by one small lamp set in a niche in the wall. It was lined with red silk, and floored with love furs and cushions, the furs being better than some six to eight inches deep. In the alcove the demeanor of the girl changed and she suddenly rolled onto her back and lifted one knee. She looked at him saucily. \"I have never been in one of these places before,\" she said. Kuurus tossed the silk and the chains to one side of the alcove and grinned at her. \"I now understand,\" she said, \"why it is that free women never enter Paga taverns.\" \"But you are only a slave girl,\" said Kuurus. \"True,\" she said forlornly, turning her head to one side. Kurrus removed her slave livery. The girl sat up, her eyes bright, holding her ankles with her hands. \"So this is what these places are like,\" she said, looking about her. \"Do you like them?\" asked Kuurus. \"Well,\" she said, demurely, looking down, \"they make a girl feel---rather---well---.\" \"Precisely,\" agreed Kuurus. \"I see that I shall have to bring you here more often.\" \"That might be pleasant,\" said she, \"Master.\" He fingered the collar on her throat, yellow enameled over steel. It bore the legend: I am the property of the House of Cernus. \"I would like,\" he said, \"to remove the collar.\" \"Unfortunately,\" said she, \"the key reposes in the House of Cernus.\" \"It is a dangerous thing you are doing, Elizabeth,\" said Kuurus. \"You had best call me Vella,\" said she, \"for that is the name I am known by in the House of Cernus.\" He gathered her in his arms, and she kissed him. \"I have missed you,\" said she, \"Tarl Cabot.\" \"And I have missed you, too,\" I said. I kissed her. \"We must speak of our work,\" I mumbled, \"our plans and purposes, and how we may achieve them.\" \"The business of Priest-Kings and such,\" said she, \"is surely less important than our present activities.\" I mumbled something, but she would hear nothing of it, and suddenly feeling her in my arms I laughed and held her to me, and she laughed, and whispered, \"I love you, Tarl Cabot,\" and I said to her, \"Kuurus, Kuurus---of the Caste of Assassins,\" and she said, \"Yes, Kuurs---and poor Vella of the House of Cernus---picked up on the street and brought to this place, given no choice but to serve the pleasure of a man who is not even her master---cruel Kuurus!\" We fell to kissing and touching and loving, and after some time she whispered, eyes bright, \"Ah Kuurus, you well know how to use a wench.\" \"Be quiet,\" Kuurus told her, \"Slave Girl.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master,\" she said. I reached over and put the bit of Pleasure Silk under her, that it might be wrinkled and bear the stains of her sweat. \"Clever, Master,\" said she, smiling. \"Be silent, Slave Girl,\" I warned her, and she heeded my injunction, for she then, for better than an Ahn, served in a silence that was exquisite, broken only by our breathing, her small moans, and cries. Chapter 3: The Game When I deemed it wise to depart from Vella, I knotted her yellow slave livery about her neck and cried out, \"Be gone, Slave!\" and then slapped my hands together at which juncture she let forth a howl as though she had been struck, and then, blubbering hysterically and crying out, she scrambled from the alcove, hastily and awkwardly, half falling, descended the narrow ladder and fled weeping from the Paga tavern, much to the delight and amusement of the customers below. A few moments later I emerged, descended the ladder and went to the proprietor of the shop, throwing the bit of soiled Pleasure Silk and the slave chains to the counter. I looked at him and he did not ask for pay, but looked away, and so I left the tavern and entered the street. It was still light and in the early evening. I was not much afraid of being recognized. I had dyed my hair black. I had not been in Ar in several years. I wore the habiliments of the Caste of Assassins. I looked about myself. I have always been impressed with Ar, for it is the largest, the most populous and the most luxurious city of all known Gor. Its walls, its countless cylinders, its spires and towers, its lights, its beacons, the high bridges, the lamps, the lanterns of the bridges, are unbelievably exciting and fantastic, particularly as seen from the more lofty bridges or the roofs of the higher cylinders. But perhaps they are the most marvelous when seen at night from tarnback. I remembered the night, so many years ago, when I had first streaked over the walls of Ar, on the Planting Feast, and had made the strike of a tarnsman for the Home Stone of Gor's greatest city, Glorious Ar,. As I could I put these thoughts from my mind, but I could not fully escape them, for among them was the memory of a girl, she, Talena, the daughter of the Ubar of Ubars, Marlenus, who so many years before had been the Free Companion of a simple Warrior of Ko-ro-ba, he who had been torn from her at the will of Priest-Kings and returned to distant Earth, there to wait until he was needed again for another turn of play in the harsh games of Gor. When the city of Ko-ro-ba had been destroyed by Priest-Kings and its people scattered, no two to stand together, the girl had disappeared. The Warrior of Ko-ro-ba had never found her. He did not know whether she was alive or dead. For those who passed in the street some might have been startled had they noted, standing in the shadows, one who wore the black of the Assassins, who wept. \"Game! Game!\" I heard, and quickly shook my head, driving away the memories of Ar, and of the girl once known, always loved. The word actually cried was \"Kaissa,\" which is Gorean for \"Game\". It is a general term, but when used without qualification, it stands for only one game. The man who called out wore a robe of checkered red and yellow squares, and the game board, of similar squares, with ten ranks and ten files, giving a hundred\n\nsquares, hung over his back; slung over his left shoulder, as a warrior wears a sword, was a leather bag containing the pieces, twenty to a side, red and yellow, representing Spearmen, Tarnsmen, the Riders of the High Tharlarion, and so on. The object of the game is the capture of the opponent's Home Stone. Capturings of individual pieces and continuations take place much as in chess. The affinities of this game with chess are, I am confident, more than incidental. I recalled that men from many periods and cultures of Earth had been brought, from time to time, to Gor, our Counter-Earth. With them they would have brought their customs, their skills, their habits, their games, which, in time, would presumably have undergone considerable modification. I have suspected that chess, with its fascinating history and development, as played on Earth, may actually have derived from a common ancestor with the Gorean game, both of them perhaps tracing their lineage to some long-forgotten game, perhaps the draughts of Egypt or some primitive board game of India. It might be mentioned that the game, as I shall speak of it, for in Gorean it has no other designation, is extremely popular on Gor, and even children find among their playthings the pieces of the game; there are numerous clubs and competitions among various castes and cylinders; careful records of important games are kept and studied; lists of competitions and tournaments and their winners are filed in the Cylinder of Documents; there is even in most Gorean libraries a section containing an incredible number of scrolls pertaining to the techniques, tactics and strategy of the game. Almost all civilized Goreans, of whatever caste, play. It is not unusual to find even children of twelve or fourteen years who play with a depth and sophistication, a subtlety and a brilliance, that might be the envy of the chess masters of Earth. But this man now approaching was not an amateur, nor an enthusiast. He was a man who would be respected by all the castes in Ar; he was a man who would be recognized, most likely, not only by every urchin wild in the streets of the city but by the Ubar as well; he was a Player, a professional, one who earned his living through the game. The Players are not a caste, nor a clan, but they tend to be a group apart, living their own lives. They are made up of men from various castes who often have little in common but the game, but that is more than enough. They are men who commonly have an extraordinary aptitude for the game but beyond this men who have become drunk on it, men lost in the subtle, abstract liquors of variation, pattern and victory, men who live for the game, who want it and need it as other men might want gold, or others power and women, or others the rolled, narcotic strings of toxic kanda. There are competitions of Players, with purses provided by amateur organizations, and sometimes by the city itself, and these purses are, upon occasion, enough to enrich a man, but most Players earn a miserable living by hawking their wares, a contest with a master, in the street. The odds are\n\nusually one to forty, one copper tarn disk against a forty-piece, sometimes against an eighty-piece, and sometimes the amateur who would play the master insists on further limitations, such as the option to three consecutive moves at a point in the game of his choice, or that the master must remove from the board, before the game begins, his two tarnsmen, or his Riders of the High Tharlarion. Further, in order to gain Players, the master, if wise, occasionally loses a game, which is expensive at the normal odds; and the game must be lost subtly, that the amateur must believe he has won. I had once known a Warrior in Ko-ro-ba, a dull, watery-eyed fellow, who boasted of having beaten Quintus of Tor in a Paga Tavern in Thentis. Those who play the game for money have a hard lot, for the market is a buyer's market, and commonly men will play with them only on terms much to their satisfaction. I myself, when Centius of Cos was in Ko-ro-ba, might have played him on the bridge near the Cylinder of Warriors for only a pair of copper tarn disks. It seemed sad to me, that I, who knew so little of the game, could have so cheaply purchased the privilege of sitting across the board from such a master. It seemed to me that men should pay a tarn disk of gold just to be permitted to watch such a master play, but such were not the economic realities of the game. In spite of having the respect, even to some degree the adulation, of almost all Goreans, the Players lived poorly. On the Street of Coins they found it difficult even to arrange loans. They were not popular with innkeepers, who would not shelter them unless they paid in advance. Many were the nights a master would be found rolled in robes in a Paga tavern, where, for a bit of tarsk meat and a pot of paga, and an evening's free play with customers, he would be permitted to sleep. Many of the Players dreamed of the day they might be nominated for intercity competitions at the Fairs of the Sardar, for a victor in the Sardar Fairs earns enough to keep himself, and well, for years, which he then would devote to the deeper study of the game There is also some money for the masters in the annotation of games, printed on large boards near the Central Cylinder, in the preparation or editing of scrolls on the game, and in the providing of instruction for those who would improve their skills.. On the whole, however, the Players live extremely poorly. Further, there is a harsh competition among themselves, for positions in certain streets and on certain bridges. The most favorable locations for play are, of course, the higher bridges in the vicinity of the richer cylinders, the most expensive Paga taverns, and so on. These positions, or territories, are allotted by the outcome of games among the Players themselves In Ar, the high bridge near the Central Cylinder, housing the palace of the Ubar and the meeting place of the city's High Council, was held, and had been for four years, by the young and brilliant, fiery Scormus of Ar. \"Game!\" I heard, an answering cry, and a fat fellow, of the Caste of Vintners, puffing and bright eyed, wearing a white tunic with a representation in green cloth of leaves about the collar and down the sleeves of the garment, stepped forth from a doorway. Without speaking the Player sat down cross-legged at one side of the street,\n\nand place the board in front of him. Opposite him sat the Vintner. \"Set the pieces,\" said the Player. I was surprised, and looked more closely, as the Vintner took the wallet filled with game pieces from the man's shoulder and began, with his stubby fingers, to quickly arrange the pieces. The Player was a rather old man, extremely unusual on Gor, where the stabilization serums were developed centuries ago by the Caste of Physicians in Ko-ro-ba and Ar, and transmitted to the Physicians of other cities at several of the Sardar Fairs. Age, on Gor, interestingly, was regarded, and still is, by the Castes of Physicians as a disease, not an inevitable natural phenomenon. The fact that it seemed to be a universal disease did not dissuade the caste from considering how it might be combated. Accordingly the research of centuries was turned to this end. Many other diseases, which presumably flourished centuries ago on Gor, tended to be neglected, as less dangerous and less universal than that of aging. A result tended to be that those susceptible to many diseases died and those less susceptible lived on, propagating their kind. One supposes something similar may have happened with the plagues of the Middle Ages on Earth. At any rate, disease is now almost unknown among the Gorean cities, with the exception of the dreaded Dar-kosis disease, or the Holy Disease, research on which is generally frowned upon by the Caste of Initiates, who insist the disease is a visitation of the displeasure of the Priest-Kings on its recipients. The fact that the disease tends to strike those who have maintained the observances recommended by the Caste of Initiates, and who regularly attend their numerous ceremonies, as well as those who do not, is seldom explained, though, when pressed, the Initiates speak of possible secret failures to maintain the abservances or the inscrutable will of Priest-Kings. I also think the Gorean success in combating aging may be partly due to the severe limitations, in many matters, on the technology of the human beings on the planet. Priest-Kings have no wish that men become powerful enough on Gor to challenge them for the supremacy of the planet. They believe, perhaps correctly, that man is a shrewish animal which, if it had the power, would be likely to fear Priest-Kings and attempt to exterminate them. Be that as it may, the Priest-Kings have limited man severely on this planet in many respects, notably in weaponry, communication and transportation. On the other hand, the brilliance which men might have turned into destructive channels was then diverted, almost of necessity, to other fields, most notably medicine, though considerable achievements have been accomplished in the production of translation devices, illumination and architecture. The Stabilization Serums, which are regarded as the right of all human beings, be they civilized or barbarian, friend or enemy, are administered in a series of injections, and the effect is, incredibly, an eventual, gradual transformation of certain genetic structures, resulting in\n\nindefinite cell replacement without pattern deterioration. These genetic alterations, moreover, are commonly capable of being transmitted. For example, though I received the series of injections when first I came to Gor many years ago I had been told by Physicians that they might, in my case, have been unnecessary, for I was the child of parents who, though of Earth, had been of Gor, and had received the serums. But different human beings respnd differently to the Stabilization Serums, and the Serums are more effective with some than with others. With some the effect lasts indefinitely, with others it wears off after but a few hundred years, with some the effect does not occur at all, with others, tragically, the effect is not to stabilize the pattern but to hasten its degeneration. The odds, however, are in the favor of the recipient, and there are few Goreans who, if it seems they need the Serum's, do not avail themselves of them. The Player, as I have mentioned, was rather old, not extremely old but rather old. His face was pale and lined, and his hair was white. He was smooth shaven. The most startling thing to me about the man was not that he was older than one commonly sees in the streets of a Gorean city, but rather that he was clearly blind. The eyes were not pleasant to look upon, for they seemed empty of iris and pupil, and were simply ovoid glazes of massed scar tissue, ridged and irregular. Even the sockets of the eyes were ringed with white tissue. I knew then how the man had been blinded. A hot iron had been pressed into each of his eyes, probably long ago. In the center of his forehead, there was a large brand, the capital initial of the Gorean word for slave, in block script. But I knew that he was not a slave, for it is not permitted that Players be slave. That a slave should play is regarded as an insult to free men, and an insult to the game. Further, no free man would care to be beaten by a slave. I gathered, from the blinding and the mark on his forehead, that the man had once offended a slaver, a man of power in the city. \"The pieces are set,\" said the Vintner, his fingers trembling. \"Your terms?\" asked the Player. \"I move first,\" said the Vintner. This, of course, was an advantage, permitting the Vintner to choose his own opening, an opening he may have studied for a lifetime. Moreover, having the first move, he might more speedily develop his pieces, bringing them into the central areas of the board where they might control crucial squares, the crossroads of the board. And further, having the first move, he would probably be able to carry the initiative of the aggressor several moves into the game, perhaps to the conclusion. Players, when playing among themselves, with men of equal strength, frequently play for a draw when they do not have the first move. \"Very well,\" said the Player. \"Further,\" said the Vintner, \"I declare for the three-move option at my time of choice, and you must play without the Ubar and Ubara, or the first tarnsman.\" By this time there were four or five other individuals gathered about, besides myself, to observe the play. There was a Builder, two Saddle Makers, a Baker, and a Tarn Keeper, a fellow who wore on his shoulder a green patch, indicating he favored the Greens. Indeed, since there were no races this day in Ar, and\n\nhe wore the patch, he perhaps worked in the tarncots of the Greens. None of this crowd seemed much to object to my presence there, though, to be sure, none would stand near me. In the prospect of a game, Goreans tend to forget the distances, amenities and trepidations of more sober moments. And through this small crowd, when it heard the terms of the Vintner, there coursed a mutter of irritation. \"Very well,\" said the Player, looking out over the board placidly, seeing nothing. \"And the odds I choose,\" said the Vintner, \"are one to eighty.\" At this a real growl of anger coursed through the onlookers. \"One to eighty,\" said the Vintner, firmly, triumphantly. \"Very well,\" said the Player. \"Ubar's Tarnsman to Physician Seven,\" said the Vintner. \"The Centian Opening,\" said one of the Saddle Makers. The Baker looked over his shoulder and called down the street to some men gathered there. \"The Centian!\" The men ambled over to watch. I supposed they were interested in seeing what the Player's response would be to yellow's fourteenth move, a move on which authorities disagreed sharply, some favoring Ubar's Initiate to Scribe three, and others the withdrawal of Ubara's Spearman to cover the vulnerable Ubar's two. To my surprise, the Player chose the withdrawal of Ubara's Spearman to cover Ubar two, which seemed to me rather defensive, and surely cost him the possibility of a dangerous but promising counterattack, which would eventually, if all went well, culminate with his second tarnsman at his opponent's Initiate two. When this move was made I saw two or three of the observers look at one another in disgust, and wink, and then turn about and walk away. The Vintner, however, did not seem to notice, but made the standard aggressive response, pressing his attack forward by moving Second Spearman to Initiate Five. The face of the Player seemed placid. I myself was keenly disappointed. It seemed reasonably clear to me, at that point, that the Player had made a presumably weaker move in order to prejudice the game against himself, a move which could be defended, however, on the grounds that certain authorities favored it. I myself, in Ko-ro-ba, had seen Centius of Cos playing his own opening more than a dozen times and he had never drawn back the Ubara's Spearman at that point. When I saw the excitement of the Vintner and the calm, stoic placidity of the Player I felt sad, for I recognized, as did several of the others, that this game, expensive though it might be, was to be the Vintner's. The Vintner, you must understand, was not a bad player. He was actually quite skilled, and would have played well among even gifted Goreans, to whom the game is almost second nature, but he was not of Player caliber, by far. I continued to watch, but not happily. At one or two points I noted the Player had made subtly ineffective moves, apparently sound but yet leaving weaknesses which could be, even four or five moves in the future, exploited rather decisively. Late in the game, the Player seemed to rally, and the Vintner\n\nbegan to sweat, and rubbed his fingers together, and held his head in his hands, studying the board as though he would bore through it with his gaze. No one watching was much impressed, incidentally, that the Player was blind and yet remembering each move and the complexities of the board. Goreans often play without the board and pieces, though generally they prefer them because then less effort need be expended on the purely mnemonic matters of keeping the pattern in mind, move to move. I myself had seen chess masters on Earth play twenty boards simultaneously and blindfolded. Yet I, of Earth origin, while recognizing that what I was witnessing was actually not as astonishing as it might seem, was nonetheless impressed. The Vintner, of course, seemed to give no heed to anything but the game. At one point, when the Vintner seemed hard pressed, I, and several of the others, noted that his hand strayed to the board, moving his Second Spearman to Builder Four from Physician Four, thus placing him placing him on an open column. One of the Saddle Makers cried out in anger. \"Watch out there!\" He moved Second Spearman to Builder Four!\" \"I did not!\" cried the Vintner---almost a shriek. The Player looked puzzled. All eyes turned to the Player and he put his head down for a moment, apparently reconstructing the game from memory, through all of its better than forty moves to that point, and then he smiled. \"His Second Spearman,\" he said, \"should be at Builder Four.\" \"You see!\" cried the Vintner, gleefully. Angrily the Saddle Maker turned away and strode down the street. No one else said anything further. From time to time others would come to watch, but, as it became clear what was occurring, they would leave. At most times there were, however, some seven or eight individuals, including myself, who were watching. Finally, it grew late in the end game and it would be but a matter of four or five moves and the Player's Home Stone must be lost. The Vintner had taken his three-move option late in the game to build up an incredibly devastating attack. The Player was now in such a predicament that I doubted that Centius of Cos, or Quintus of Tor, or even the city champion, Scormus of Ar, could have done much. I, and others in the crowd, were angry. I spoke. The Player, of course, could only hear my voice. \"A tarn disk of gold and of double weight,\" said I, \"to red, should red win.\" The crowd gasped. The Vintner acted as though struck. The Player lifted his sightless eyes toward my face. I took from my belt a tarn disk of double weight, and of gold, and gave it to the Player, who took it in his fingers and felt its weight, and then he put it between his teeth and bit it. He handed it back to me. \"It is truly gold,\" he said. \"Do not mock me.\"\n\n\"A double tarn,\" said I, \"to red, should red win.\" Such an amount I knew would not be likely to be earned in a year by a Player. The Player turned his head toward me, lifting the scarred remains of his eyes, as though he might see. Every nerve in that old face seemed strained, as though trying to understand what might lie there beyond him in the darkness that was his world, save for the memory of the movement of pieces on a checkered board. He put out his hand over the board, and I grasped it, firmly. I held his hand for a moment and he held mine, and I felt his grip, and smiled, for I knew then, blinded and branded, weak and old, he was yet a man. He released my hand and sat back, cross-legged, his back straight as that of a Ubar, a smile playing across the corners of his mouth. The sightless eyes seemed to gleam. \"Second Tarnsman,\" said he, \"to Ubara's Builder Nine.\" A cry of astonishment coursed through the crowd. Even the Vintner cried out. He must be insane, I said to myself. Such a move was utterly unrelated to the game. It was random, meaningless. He was subject to one of the most devastating attacks that could be mounted in the game. His Home Stone, in four moves, would fall. He must defend, for his very life! With a trembling hand, the Vintner shoved his Second Spearman to the left, capturing the Player's First Spearman, which had not been defended. I inwardly groaned. \"Ubar's Rider of the High Tharlarion,\" said the Player, \"to Ubar's Physician Eight.\" I closed my eyes. It was another meaningless move. The crowd looked on, staggered, puzzled, speechless. Was this man not a Player? Relentlessly the Vintner forced through again with his Second Spearman, this time capturing the Player's Ubara's Rider of the High Tharlarion. \"Ubar's Scribe to Ubara's Scribe Six,\" said the Player. Under other conditions I would have left at this point, but as I held the gold piece in question I knew that I would have to remain until the end, which, as some consolation, would be but shortly now. Even the Vintner seemed disturbed. \"Do you wish to reconsider your last move?\" he asked, offering a rare concession among players of the game, and one I had never expected from the Vintner, from what I had seen of him, to offer. I decided he was perhaps not such a bad fellow, though perhaps winning meant more to him than it should. \"Ubar's Scribe to Ubara's Scribe Six,\" repeated the Player. Mechanically the Vintner made the move on the board for the Player. \"My first tarnsman,\" said the Vintner, \"captures Ubara's Scribe.\" The capture of the Player's Home Stone would take place on the next move. \"Do you wish to reconsider you move?\" asked the Player, looking across the board, not seeing, but smiling. There seemed something grand about him in that moment, as though it were a gesture of magnanimity worthy of a victorious Ubar. The Vintner looked at him puzzled. \"No,\" he said. \"I do not.\" The Player shrugged. \"I capture your Home Stone on the next move,\" said the Vintner. \"You have no next move,\" said the Player. The crowd gasped and they and I, and the Vintner, studied the board. \"Aii!\" I cried, though the outburst was scarcely in keeping with the somber black I wore, and an instant later the Tarn Keeper and the Saddle Maker cried\n\nout, and began to stamp their feet in the dust, and pound their fists against their left shoulders. Then others watching cried out with glee. I myself remove my sword from its sheath and with it struck my shield. Then the Vintner began to howl with pleasure and slap his knees so pleased he was at the wonder of it, though he himself was the victim. \"Magnificent!\" he cried weeping, taking the Player by the shoulders and shaking him. And then the Vintner himself, as proud as though it had been his own, announced the Player's next move. \"Scribe takes Home Stone.\" The crowd and I cried out with delight, marveling on it, the now apparent simplicity of it, the attack which had been not so much mounted as revealed by the apparently meaningless moves, intended only to clear the board for the vital attack, coming from the improbable Ubara's Scribe, one of the least powerful pieces on the board, yet, when used in combination with, say, a tarnsman and a rider of the high tharlarion, as devastating as the Ubar itself. None of us, including the Vintner, had so much as suspected the attack. The Vintner pressed the copper tarn disk, which the Player had won from him, into the Player's hands, and the Player placed the coin in his pouch. I then pressed into the hands of the Player the tarn disk of gold, of double weight, and the man held it clenched in his hands, and smiled and rose to his feet. The Vintner was picking up the pieces and putting them back in the leather game bag, which he then slung about the man's shoulder. He then handed him the board, which the Player hung over his other shoulder. \"Thank you for playing,\" said the Vintner. The Player put out his hand and touched the Vintner's face, remembering it. \"Thank you for playing,\" said the Player. \"I wish you well,\" said the Vintner. \"I wish you well, said the Player. The Vintner then turned and left. As he did so I heard some of the bystanders, the Saddle Maker and the fellow who was the Tarn Keeper, he who wore the patch of the Greens, discussing the game. \"It was really quite simple,\" the Saddle Maker was explaining, \"even obvious.\" I smiled and I noted that the Player, too, smiled. \"You are a Merchant?\" asked the Player. \"No,\" I said. \"How is it then,\" asked he, \"that you have such riches?\" It means nothing,\" I said. \"Can I help you to your home?\" \"You are surely of High Caste,\" said the Player, \"to have such gold.\" \"May I take you to your home?\" I asked. The Tarn Keeper, breaking away from the Saddle Maker, came over to us. He was a short man, with close-cropped brown hair, a squarish face. I noted the patch of the Greens on his shoulder. He smiled at me. \"You did well,\" said he, \"Killer,\" and with a grin turned and left. I turned again to the Player, but he was now standing there in the street, seeming somehow alone, though I stood at his side. \"You are of the Assassins?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" I said, \"it is my caste.\"\n\nHe pressed the piece of gold into my hand and turned away, stumbling from me, reaching out with his right hand to guide himself along the wall. \"Wait!\" I cried. \"You have won this! Take it!\" I ran to him. \"No!\" he cried, striking out wildly with a hand, trying to force me away. I stepped back. He stood there, panting, not seeing me, his body bent over, angry. \"It is black gold,\" he said. \"It is black gold.\" He then turned away, and began to grope his way from the place of the game. I stood there in the street and watched him go, in my hand holding the piece of gold which I had meant to be his. Chapter 4: Cernus \"Place your first sword before me,\" I said, \"that I may kill him.\" Cernus of Ar, of the House of Cernus, studied me, his large face impassive, his eyes revealing nothing, like gray stones. His large hands rested over the arms of the curved curule chair in which he sat, which was mounted on a platform of stone, about a foot high and twelve feet square. In the base of the platform there were mounted six slave rings. Cernus of Ar wore a course black robe, woven probably from the wool of the bounding, two-legged Hurt, a domesticated marsupial raised in large numbers in the environs of several of Gor's northern cities. The Hurt, raised on large, fenced ranches, herded by domesticated sleen and sheared by chained slaves, replaces its wool four times a year. The House of Cernus, I had heard, had interests in several of the Hurt Ranches near the city. The black of the garment of Cernus was broken only by three stripes of silk sewn length-wise on his left sleeve, two stripes of blue enclosing one of yellow. When I had spoken several of the men-at-arms of Cernus had shifted uneasily. Some had grasped their weapons. \"I am the first sword in the House of Cernus,\" said Cernus. The room in which I stood was the Hall of the House of Cernus. It was a large room, some seventy feet square and with a ceiling of some fifty feet in height. Set in the wall to my left, as in the base of the stone platform, were slave rings, a dozen or so. The room was innocent of the energy bulbs of the Caste of Builders. In the walls were torch racks, but there were now no torches. The room was lit, and grayly, by sunlight now filtering in through several narrow, barred windows set very high in the thick stone of the walls. It reminded me, in its way, of a room in a prison and such, in its way, it was, for it was a room in the House of Cernus, greatest of the slave houses of Ar. Cernus wore about his neck, on a golden chain, a medallion which bore the crest of the House of Cernus, a tarn with slave chains grasped in its talons. Behind Cernus, on the wall, there hung a large tapestry, richly done in red and gold, which bore the same sign. \"I have come,\" I said, \" to rent my sword to the House of Cernus.\" \"We have been expecting you,\" said Cernus. I revealed no sign of surprise. \"It is understood by me,\" said Cernus, evidently relaying certain reports which had reached him, \"that Portus, of the House of Portus, sought to hire your\n\nsword in vain.\" \"It is true,\" I said. Cernus smiled. \"Otherwise,\" he said, \" surely would not have come here---for in this house we are innocent.\" This was an allusion to the mark which I wore upon my forehead. I had spent the night following the game in an inn, had washed away the mark and this morning, early, when I had arisen, had placed it again on my forehead. After a bit of cold bosk, some water and a handful of peas, I had come to the House of Cernus. It was not yet the seventh Gorean hour but already the slaver was up, conducting his affairs, when I had been ushered into his presence. At his right hand there was a Scribe, an angular, sullen man with deep eyes, with tablets and stylus. It was Caprus of Ar, Chief Accountant to the House of Cernus. He lived in the house and seldom went abroad in the streets. It was with this man that Vella had been placed, her registration, papers and purchase having been arranged. In the House of Cernus, after the sheet, bracelets, leash and collar had been removed, agents of the House of Cernus had checked her fingerprints against those on the papers. She had then been examined thoroughly by the Physicians of the House of Cernus. Then, found acceptable, she had knelt while agents of the House signed the receipt of her delivery and endorsed her papers, retaining one set, giving one set to the seller's agent, for forwarding to the Cylinder of Documents. Then she had submitted herself to the House of Cernus, kneeling before one of its agents, lowering her head, extending her arms, wrists crossed. She had then been collared and turned over to Caprus, to be combed and cleaned, for the smell of the pens was on her, given two sets of slave livery and instructed in her duties. Caprus was said to be a friend of Priest-Kings. There had been no difficulty, it seemed, in placing Vella in the House of Cernus. Yet I feared for her safety. It was a dangerous game. \"May I ask,\" inquired Cernus, \"for whom you wear on your forehead the mark of the black dagger?\" I would speak of these things, to some extent, with Cernus, for it was important, though perilous, that he should understand what purported to be my mission. It was now time that certain things should be revealed, that they might leak into the streets of Ar. \"I come to avenge,\" I said, \"Tarl Cabot, he of Ko-ro-ba.\" There were cries of astonishment from the men-at-arms. I smiled to myself. I had little doubt but that in an Ahn the story would be in all the Paga taverns of Ar, on all the bridges and in all the cylinders. \"In this city,\" said Cernus, \"Tarl Cabot, he of Ko-ro-ba, is known as Tarl of Bristol.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I have heard sing of him,\" said Cernus. I observed the slaver closely. He seemed troubled, shocked. Two of his men rushed from the room. I heard them shouting in the corridors of the house. \"I regret to hear it,\" said Cernus, at last. Then he looked at me. \"There will be few in Ar,\" he said, \"who would not wish you well in your dark work.\" \"Who could kill Tarl of Bristol?\" cried out a man-at-arms, not even thinking that Cernus had not acknowledged his right to speak. \"A knife on the high bridge,\" said I, \"in the vicinity of the Cylinder of Warriors---at the Twentieth Ahn---in the darkness and the shadows of the lamps.\" The men-at-arms looked at one another. \"It could only have been so,\" said one. I myself felt bitterly about a poorly lit bridge in the vicinity of the Cylinder of Warriors---and about a certain hour on a certain day---for it was on that bridge that a young man, of the Warriors, had walked perhaps not more than a quarter of an Ahn before I myself would have passed that way. His crime, if he had had one, was that his build was rather like mine, and his hair, in the shadows, the half-darkness of the lamps and the three moons of Gor, might have seemed to one who watched like mine. The older Tarl, the Koroban master of arms, and myself had found the body, and near it, the patch of green caught in a crack in the grillwork of one of the lamps on the bridge, where perhaps it had been torn from the shoulder of a running, stumbling man. The older Tarl had turned the body in his hands, and we had looked on it, and both of us had regarded one another. \"This knife,\" said the Older Tarl, \"was to have been yours.\" \"Do you know him?\" I asked. \"No,\" he had said, \"other than the fact that he was a warrior from the allied city of Thentis, a poor Warrior.\" We noted that his pouch had not been cut. The killer had wanted only the life. The older Tarl, taking the knife by the hand guard, withdrew it. It was a throwing knife, of a sort used in Ar, much smaller than the southern quiva, and tapered on only one side. It was a knife designed for killing. Mixed with the blood and fluids of the body there was a smear of white at the end of the steel, the softened residue of a glaze of kanda paste, now melted by body heat, which had coated the tip of the blade. On the hilt of the dagger, curling about it, was the legend, \"I have sought him. I have found him.\" It was a killing knife. \"The Caste of Assassins?\" I asked. \"Unlikely,\" had said the Older Tarl, \"for Assassins are commonly too proud for poison.\" Then, not speaking, the Older Tarl had slung the body over his shoulders. I took the patch from the grillwork. We took the body, fortunately meeting no one at that late hour, to the nearby compartment of my father, Matthew Cabot, Administrator of the City. The older Tarl, my father and I long discussed the matter. We were confident that this attempt on my life, for that it seemed to be, had something to do with the Sardar, and the Priest-Kings, and the Others, not Priest-Kings, who desired this world of Priest-Kings and men, and, surreptitiously and cruelty, were fighting to obtain it, though as yet, perhaps fearing the power of Priest-Kings or not fully understanding how severely it had\n\nbeen reduced in the Nest War of more than a year ago, they had not dared to attack openly. Accordingly, biding our time, we let it be known in the city that Tarl Cabot had been slain. Now, in the Hall of the House of Cernus, my thoughts became bitter. I had indeed come to avenge. But I did not even know his name. He had been a tarnsman of Thentis. He had come to the allied city of Ko-ro-ba, and had there found his death, for no reason that was clear to me other than the fact that he had had the misfortune to resemble me. \"Why,\" asked Cernus, breaking into my reverie, \"did not Warriors of Ko-ro-ba come to Ar, to search out the killer?\" \"It was not an act of war,\" said I. \"Further,\" I pointed out, \"now that Kazrak of Port Kar is no long Administrator of Ar it seemed unlikely that Ar would welcome Koroban Warriors within her walls.\" \"It is true,\" said one of the men-at-arms. \"Do you know the name of the man whom you seek?\" asked Cernus. \"I have only this,\" I said, drawing forth from my belt the wrinkled patch of green cloth. \"It is a faction patch,\" said Cernus. \"There are thousands of such in Ar.\" \"It is all I have,\" I said. \"This house itself,\" said Cernus, \"is allied with the faction of the Greens, as certain other houses, and various of the establishments of the city, are associated with other factions.\" \"I know,\" I said, \"that the House of Cernus is allied with the Greens.\" \"I now see,\" said Cernus, \"that there is more reason than I suspected in your desire to rent your sword in this house.\" \"Yes,\" said I, \"for all I know, the man I seek may be of this house.\" \"It is unlikely though,\" said Cernus, \"for those who favor the Greens are numbered in the thousands and come from all castes of Gor. The Administrator of Ar himself, and the High Initiate, are partisans of the green.\" I shrugged. \"But you are welcome in this house,\" said Cernus. \"As you presumably know these are difficult times in Ar, and a good sword is a good investment, and steel in these days is upon occasion more valuable than gold.\" I nodded. \"I will upon occasion,\" said Cernus, \"have commissions for you.\" He looked down on me. \"But for the time,\" he said, \"it is valuable for me simply for it to be known that your sword is in this house.\" \"I await your commands,\" I said. \"You will be shown to your quarters,\" said Cernus, gesturing to a nearby man-at-arms. \"Incidentally,\" said he, \"Killer.\" I turned to face him. \"It is known to me that in the tavern of Spinduis, you slew four Warriors of the House of Portus.\" I said nothing. \"Four pieces of gold,\" said Cernus, \"double tarns, will be sent to your rooms.\" I nodded my head. \"Also,\" said Cernus, \"it is understood by me that you picked up one of my\n\ngirls on the street.\" I tensed slightly, my hand dropping to the hilt of the short sword. \"What was her number?\" Cernus was asking Caprus, who stook near him. \"74673,\" said the Scribe. I had anticipated that there would be some mention of Vella, for it was unlikely that Cernus would be unaware of my contact with her. Indeed, I had instructed her, when she had returned late to the House of Cernus, to bewail and protest what had theoretically happened to her in no uncertain terms. Accordingly, I was not surprised that the Scribe had her number ready for Cernus. Moreover, he probably knew it anyway, as she had been assigned to his staff, primarily to run errands in the city, for Caprus, it was said, seldom cared to leave the House of Cernus. I wished to be able to work closely with Vella in the House of Cernus. I was gambling on the unpleasant sense of humor not uncommonly found among slavers. \"Do you object?\" I asked. Cernus smiled. \"Our Physicians ascertained,\" said he, \"that she is only a Red Silk Girl.\" \"I scarcely supposed,\" said I, \"that you would permit a White Silk Girl to go alone on the streets of Ar.\" Cernus chuckled. \"Indeed not,\" he said. \"The risk is too much, sometimes as much as ten gold pieces.\" Then he leaned back. \"74673,\" he said. \"The girl!\" cried out the Scribe. From a side entrance to the hall, where she had been kept, Elizabeth Cardwell, Vella, was thrust into the room. She was dressed as she had been when first I saw her near the great gate of Ar, barefoot, the yellow slave livery, the unbound dark hair, the yellow collar. She ran rapidly to a place before the stone platform, before the curule chair of Cernus, where she fell to her knees in the position of pleasure slave, head bowed. I was amused, for she had run as a slave girl is sometimes taught to run, with rapid short steps, her legs almost straight, her feet scarcely leaving the ground, back straight, head turned to the left, arms at her sides, palms out at a forty-five degree angle, more of a dancer's motion than a true run. Elizabeth, I knew, would hate that. I remembered her on the Plains of Turia, in the Land of the Wagon Peoples. There were few girls with her wind and stamina, her strength and vitality, few who could run at the stirrup of a Warrior as well as she. How offensive she must find some slave keeper's notion of the pretty hurrying of a slave girl. \"Lift your head, Girl,\" said Cernus. She did so, and I gathered it was the first time she had actually looked on the face of the master of the House of Cernus. Her face was pale. \"How long have you been with us?\" asked Cernus. \"Nine days, Master,\" said she. \"Do you like it here?\" asked Cernus. \"Oh yes,\" she said, \"Master.\" \"Do you know the penalty for lying?\" asked Cernus. Elizabeth, trembling, lowered her head to the floor and crossed her wrists under her, kneeling, as it is said, to the whip. One of Cernus' men-at-arms looked at him, to see if he wished him to secure her to one of the slave rings in the\n\nbase of the platform for punishment. Cernus, with a finger, indicated negativity. \"Lift you head, Slave,\" said Cernus. Elizabeth did so. \"Remove your clothing,\" said Cernus. Without a word Elizabeth did so, standing and pulling the loop at her left shoulder. \"You are very pretty, Little Slave,\" said Cernus. \"Thank you, Master,\" said the girl. \"What is you name?\" asked Cernus. \"74673,\" she responded. \"No,\" said Cernus, \"what name would you like to be called by?\" \"Vella,\" said she, \"if it pleases Master.\" \"It is a pretty name,\" he said. She dropped her head. \"I see,\" said Cernus, \"that you wear the brand of the four bosk horns.\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"Kassar,\" he said, \"isn't it?\" \"No, Master,\" said she, \"Tuchuk.\" \"But where is the ring?\" he asked. Tuchuk women, both slave and free, have fixed in their noses a tiny ring of gold, small and fine, not unlike the wedding rings of Earth. The ponderous bosk, on which the Wagon Peoples live, among which are numbered the Kassars and the Tuchuks, also wear such rings, but there, of course, the ring is much larger and heavier. \"My last master,\" said she, \"Clark of the House of Clark in Thentis, removed it.\" \"He is a fool,\" said Cernus. \"Such a ring is marvelous. It bespeaks the barbarian, the promise of pleasures so wild and fierce a man of the cities could scarcely conceive of them.\" Elizabeth said nothing. \"I had a Tuchuk girl once,\" said Cernus, \"a wild girl of the wagons, of whom I was fond, but when she tried to kill me, I strangled her in the chain of the House of Cernus.\" He fingered the chain and medallion about his neck. \"I am not truly Tuchuk,\" said Elizabeth. \"I am only a girl from the islands north of Cos, taken by pirates of Port Kar, sold to a tarnsman, carried to and sold again in the city of Turia, and hence for twenty boskhides traded to the Tuchuks, where I was ringed and branded.\" \"How came you to Thentis?\" asked Cernus. \"Kassars raided Tuchuk wagons,\" she said. \"I was abducted, later sold to Turians.\" She spoke numbly. \"I was later sold in Tor,\" she said, \"far to the north of Turia. A year later, by slave wagon, I reached the fair of Se'Var near the Sardar, where I was sold to the House of Clark, from which house I and many others were fortunate enough to be purchased by the House of Cernus, in Glorious Ar.\" Cernus leaned back again, seemingly satisfied. \"But without the ring,\" said he, \"no one will believe the brand of the four bosk horns.\" He smiled. \"You will be regarded, my dear, as inauthentic.\" \"I am sorry,\" said Elizabeth, her head down. \"I will have a smith replace the ring,\" he said.\n\n\"As master wishes,\" she said. \"I will not hurt much the second time,\" said Cernus. Elizabeth said nothing. Cernus turned to Caprus, who stood near him. \"Is she trained?\" he asked. \"No,\" said Caprus. \"She is Red Silk but she knows almost nothing.\" \"Slave,\" said Cernus. \"Yes, Master,\" said Elizabeth. \"Stand straight and place your hands behind your head, head back.\" She did so. \"Turn slowly,\" ordered Cernus. When Elizabeth had done so once, she remained standing before him, as he had commanded. Cernus turned to Caprus. \"Was she touched by the leather?\" he inquired. \"The Physician Flaminius conducted the test,\" reported Caprus. \"She was superb.\" \"Excellent,\" said Cernus. \"You may lower your arms,\" he said to the girl. She did so, and stood there, standing before him, her head down. \"Let her be fully trained,\" said Cernus to Caprus. \"Fully?\" asked Caprus. \"Yes,\" said Cernus, \"fully.\" Elizabeth looked at him, startled. I had not counted on this, nor had Elizabeth. On the other hand, there seemed to be little that could be done about it. The training, exhaustive and detailed, I knew would take months. On the other hand it would be done presumably in the House of Cernus. Further, such training, though spread over a period of months, normally consumes only about five of the Gorean hours daily, that the girls have time to rest, to absorb their lessons, to recreate themselves in the pools and gardens of the house During this time, since Elizabeth was nominally of the staff of Caprus, we could surely find time to be about our work, for which purpose we had arranged to enter the House of Cernus. \"Are you not grateful?\" inquired Cernus, puzzled. Elizabeth dropped to her knees, head down. \"I am unworthy of so great an honor, Master,\" said she. Then Cernus pointed to me, indicating that the girl should turn. Elizabeth did so, and suddenly, superbly, she threw her arm before her mouth and cried out, as though just seeing me for the first time, and remembering me with horror. She was marvelous. \"It is he!\" she cried, shuddering. \"Who?\" inquired Cernus, innocently. I then began to suspect that my gamble, based on the often unpleasant sense of humor common among slavers, might begin to bear fruit. Elizabeth had her head down to the stone floor. \"Please, Master!\" she wept. \"It is he, the Assassin, who forced me in the streets to accompany him to the tavern of Spindius! Protect me, Master! Please, Master! Protect me, Master!\" \"Is this the slave,\" asked Cernus sternly, \"whom you forced to accompany you to the tavern of Spindius?\" \"I think she is the one,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Hateful beast!\" wept Elizabeth. \"You are only a poor little slave,\" said Cernus. \"Was he cruel to you?\" \"Yes,\" she cried, her eyes gleaming. \"Yes!\" Elizabeth, I had to admit, was a really remarkable actress. She was an extremely intelligent and talented girl, as well as beautiful. I hoped she would not be too successful in her exhibition or I might end up bubbling in a vat of boiling tharlarion oil. \"Would you like me to punish him, for you?\" asked Cernus, kindly. Elizabeth threw him a look of incredible gratitude, her eyes wide with tears, her mouth trembling. \"Yes!\" she wept. \"Please, oh Master! Punish him! Punish him!\" \"Very well,\" said Cernus, \"I will punish him by sending to his quarters an untrained slave girl.\" \"Master?\" she asked. Cernus turned to Caprus. \"When she is not in training, 74673 will keep the quarters of the Assassin.\" Caprus noted this with his stylus on his tablet. \"No!\" howled Elizabeth. \"Please Master! No! No!\" \"Perhaps,\" said Cernus, \"if your training proceeds rapidly and favorably you may, after some months, find other quarters.\" Elizabeth collapsed weeping before the stone platform. \"Let that be an incentive to be diligent, Little Slave,\" said Cernus. I threw back my head and laughed, and Cernus threw back his head and laughed, pounding on the arms of the curule chair, and the men-at-arms, too, roared with laughter. Then I turned and followed a man-at-arms, who would lead me to my quarters. Chapter 5: In the House of Cernus Kneeling back on her heels in my quarters, in the traditional fashion of Gorean women, Elizabeth laughed merrily and slapped her knees, so pleased was she. I, too, was pleased. \"How smoothly it has all gone!\" she laughed. \"And poor Vella, who must keep the quarters of the Assassin! Poor, poor Vella!\" \"Do not laugh so loudly,\" I cautioned her, smiling, while moving about the room. I had closed the door, which was of wood and heavy, and barred it with the double beam. When not barred it might be opened from the outside, if the latch string were thrust through the latch hole. Otherwise one would have to cut through the wood. I reminded myself to remember and put the latch string through when I left the room. The disadvantage of such a door, naturally, is that when no one is in the room and the latch string is out, anyone might enter, and either search the room, or wait within. Valuables, in such a room, are kept in a heavy, iron-banded chest which is bolted to the wall and kept locked. Most doors giving entry into a compartment, or set of compartments, on Gor do, however, have locks, generally hand-crafted, highly ornate locks, usually set in the center of the door and controlling a long bolt. Most of these locks, interestingly, though hand-crafted, are of the pintumbler variety, in which the locking is secured by a set of heavy pins extending into the lock plug; when the key is inserted the pins, of various lengths, are\n\nlifted to the surface of the lock plug, freeing it, so that when the key turns the plug may rotate, thereby moving the bolt. There are a number of other forms of lock also found upon occasion, a common variety being the disk lock in which moving disks, rather than pins are used. The small, heavy lock on a girl's slave collar, incidentally, may be of several varieties, but almost all are cylinder locks, either of the pin or disk variety. In a girl's collar lock there would be either six pins or six disks, one each, it is said, for each letter in the Gorean word for female slave, Kajira; the male slave, or Kajirus, seldom had a locked collar; normally a band of iron is simply hammered about his neck; often he works in chains, usually with other male slaves; in some cities, including Ar, an unchained male slave is almost never seen; there are, incidentally, far fewer male slaves than female slaves; a captured female is almost invariably collared; a captured male is almost invariably put to the sword; further, the object of slave raids, carefully scouted, organized and conducted expeditions, is almost always the acquisition of females; commonly one cylinder is struck, its bridges sealed off, its compartments broken into and ransacked for gold and beauty; the men of the compartment are slain and the women stripped; those women who do not please the slavers are slain; those that do have the goods of the compartment tied about their necks and are herded to the roof, with whip and slave goad, either to be bound across tarn saddles or thrust bound into wicker slave baskets, covered and tied shut, carried beneath the great birds in flight; sometimes, after only a quarter of an Ahn, before adequate reinforcements can be summoned, the slavers depart with their booty, leaving behind a flaming cylinder; slavers can strike any city but they are particularly a scourge to those cities which have not trained the tarn, but depend on the ponderous tharlarion. On Gor, though most locks are of metal, wooden locks are not altogether unknown. In the most common variety there are two sets of matching pins, one fixed on a wooden spatula like key and the other set, movable, falls into the bolt, securing it. With the key placed under the bolt, and pressed upward, the movable pins are lifted over the bolt, permitting its movement. This form of lock, however, as one might suspect, provides a poor sort of security, for the pins may be lifted individually by tiny sticks wedged in the holes until the bolt is free. Another form of lock, providing perhaps even less security, is the notched beam lock which may be opened by a heavy sickle-like key which is inserted through a hole in the door, fitted into the notch, and then rotated to the left or right, depending on whether the door is being locked or opened. These keys are quite heavy and are carried over the shoulder, and can, if necessary, even function as weapons. Padlocks, it might be mentioned, are common on Gor. Also, combination locks are not unknown, but they are infrequently found. The most common combination lock\n\nconsists of a set of lettered rings which conceal a bolt. When the letters are properly aligned the bolt may be withdrawn. Some locks, on the compartments of rich persons, or on the storehouses of merchants, the treasuries of cities, and so on, are knife locks or poison locks; the knife lock, when tampered with, releases a blade, or several of them, with great force, sometimes from behind the individual at the lock. On the other hand, knife locks are seldom effective against an individual who knows what to look for. Much more dangerous is the poison lock, because the opening through which the tiny pins, usually coated with a paste formed from kanda root, can emerge can be extremely small, almost invisible to the eye, easy to overlook in the crevices and grillwork of the commonly heavy, ornate Gorean lock. Another form of lock difficult to guard against is the pit lock, because of the natural crevices in Gorean tiling commonly found in corridors of cylinders; when tampered with a trap falls away beneath the individual, dropping him to a pit below, usually containing knives fixed in stone, but upon occasion osts, or half-starved sleen, or water tharlarion; sometimes, however, the pit may be simply a smooth-sided capture pit, so that the individual may later be interrogated and tortured at length. Lastly it might be mentioned that it is a capital offense for a locksmith, normally a member of the Metal Workers, to make an unauthorized copy of a key, either to keep for himself or for another. The door to my compartment, however, in the House of Cernus, did not have a lock. The two beams, of course, could effectively secure it, but they could only be used when someone was inside. The fact my compartment did not have a lock was, I assumed, no accident. I decided it would not be wise to insist that a lock be placed on the door. Such a demand might seem importunate or to evince a concern for secrecy, not in place in a house where I, supposedly, had taken gold fo"
