        "text": "A key factor in the case of Walter McMillian was that he was an African American man who at one point was respected by his community. However, an extramarital affair with a white woman is what crossed the line. Affairs were not out of the norm in the Monroeville community, but given the fact that McMillian was black dramatically changed what was perceived as socially acceptable behavior. The significant questioning of McMillian’s character came into play when a young woman, Ronda Morrison was murdered. The profound change in the community’s view toward McMillian was an incentive to point to him as the mastermind behind the murder. The police were unable to produce any viable suspects which led to pressure from the community to find and convict a killer – even if the person accused was innocent. The interrogation tactics used during the questioning of suspects and witnesses produced false allegations. Tactics such as intimidation and bargaining. These practices encompassed covert operations that allowed the law enforcement – police, district attorneys, judges – to navigate the case. Several people were instrumental in concocting the false story placing McMillian at the center of the crime. After his initial lie, Ralph Myers’s was pushed by police to produce additional information which although false, was used by police to arrest McMillian. As the story gained traction in the town,\n\nGacy was a well respected man who wouldn’t be suspected of committing multiple murders. “His first known killing was in 1972, taking the life of Timothy McCoy after luring the teen to his home” (Biography 1). Gacy’s strategy into luring kids (mostly boys) into his home was to roam the streets in search for these young kids and force them to go with him. In 1978 Robert Piest who was 15 years old went missing. His mother said Robert had went to Gacy’s home in search of a job but Robert never came back. “This time the Des Plaines police got involved and searched Gacy’s home” (Crime museum 1). When the police got involved they found things that weren’t his and items that were suspicious. Later on, “On December 22, 1978, facing mounting physical evidence against him from subsequent searches of his home, Gacy confessed that he had killed thirty-three young men and boys and buried most on his property” (Luongo 1). Gacy would torture, strangle, and rape these young men. Gacy was found guilty on all of the murders he committed and he was sentenced to the lethal injection.\n\nIn the video “The Confessions” presented by Frontline, a murder of a women that was committed by one man, quickly resulted into a false gang murder-rape scene committed by eight men. The victim, Michelle Bosko, was seen to be raped and killed in her apartment in Norfolk, Virginia. From the video, it has been proven that seven out of the eight men that confessed were innocent, but somehow they all received an unequal punishment. Because the innocent men admitted to a murder that they didn’t commit out of fear, they were all sentenced to some time in prison. The head detective, Glenn Ford, intimidated the men so much that they either were convinced that they were at the crime scene or they told him every detail that he wanted to hear.\n\nOn Saturday, December 1, 1900, a man named John Hossack was killed in his sleep with a hatchet by his wife, Margaret Hossack. The story told by Margaret was that she had heard what sounded like two boards banging together and by that time the attacker had fled and she didn’t catch a glimpse of him. The next thing she saw was her extremely wounded husband, John, who had a five-inch cut into his head and a fractured skull. A doctor, who came and examined John, and said there was no hope and John died the next morning. As an investigation started, a burglary was thought of as the first motive but the idea flawed because nothing was stolen so the idea was quickly abandoned. In the 4 days between the murder and the funeral, the police talked to\n\nNicole LaFreniere drove drunk and killed 3 people. She was just starting off her career. She had finish cosmetology school and had just gotten a job at a salon in Livermore, California. She decided to let loose and celebrate her accomplishments. She went to the Livermore Saloon bar with a couple of friends, Kyle and Jennifer and ran into some other friends she knew at the bar. She was 20 years old with a fake ID in order to buy some drinks but the bar did not ID her. She had a couple of mixed drinks, had a shot of Jagermeister and downed some Vodka. She then started dancing to the music and just having fun. Her and her friends then walked down the street to\n\n14 year old Steven Truscott gave his classmate Lynne Harper a ride on his bicycle on June 9, 1959. Truscott had dropped her off before they parted ways. Lynne was reported missing later that night, and two days later, her body was found on a nearby farm. She was sexually assaulted and strangled to death. The community was horrified by what happened to this young girl and everyone was determined to find the killer. Immediately, investigators became fixated on Truscott as the prime suspect since he was the last person to see Lynne. They didn’t consider any other suspects, even though there was no physical evidence linking him to the murder. He was arrested 24 hours later, and stood trial as an adult. (Steven Truscott |\n\nOn the night of April 19th, 1989 in New York City’s Central Park there were a number of assaults and attacks happening. Trisha went out for her routine jog through Central Park. She did not make it home and was found by a police officer in a wooded area beaten almost to death (Innocent Project, 2016). There were about 30 teenagers out that night causing chaos in Central Park. The police had picked up Raymond Santana and many others that night from the streets. Raymond Santana was one of the five young men who later would falsely confess to the assault and rape of Trisha Meilli (Innocence Project, 2016). According to the Innocence Project (2016), Santana also gave a videotaped confession along with four of the other suspects. The other young men were Yusef Salaam, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Korey Wise. All of these men, including Santana, were convicted of the attacks (Innocence Project, 2016). However, Santana was a juvenile at the time and was sentenced to five to ten years. Then, in 2002 Matias Reyes, confessed to the attack on the Central Park jogger and admitted that he was alone in the act. DNA from Reyes was cross matched with DNA from the rape kit and the hairs found on the victim (Innocence Project, 2016). The five young men’s convictions were then overturned. Santana spent five years in prison for a crime that he falsely confessed\n\nAlthough the Gilgo Beach killer had been active for years his presence was made known in 2010. In May 1, 2010 Shannan Gilbert a sex worker form New Jersey disappeared after leaving a clients (Joe Brewer) home. Ms. Gilbert responded to an AD she posted on Craigslist and went out to meet her client in Oak Beach, Long Island. The night she disappeared Shannan Gilbert called 911 claiming that someone was out to get her and that they were trying to kill her. Ms. Gilbert was last seen banging on someone’s door before she completely disappeared. Meanwhile on June 5, 2010 another sex\n\n\" On July 29, 1994, seven year old Megan Kanka, from Hamilton Township, New Jersey, was walking home after playing at a friends house. She had almost reached her front door when Jesse Timmendequas, 33, a landscaper who had lived across the street for a year invited her over to pet his new puppy ( Richard 1 ).\" \" When Megan followed him inside, he led her to an upstairs bedroom, strangled her unconscious with his belt, raped her and then asphyxiated her to death with a plastic bag. Timmendequas then placed Megan’s body in a tool box, drove it in his pick-up truck to a near-by soccer field and dumped her body in some bushes ( Jerome 1 ).\" This, and the tragic murder of Amanda Wengert, was how the name was developed. But in my paper I did not discuss the murder and raping of Amanda Wengert."
