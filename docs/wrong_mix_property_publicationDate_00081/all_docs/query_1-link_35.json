I did a quick search and quite a few NORMAN references popped up - it could be useful for you.\n\nThere are also these 4 NORMAN Monumental Inscriptions for St Matthew, Pentrich:\n\nNORMAN ANN wife of John NORMAN born 3rd September 1783, died 21st September 1861\n\nNORMAN John late of White Lee born 23rd March 1760 died 16 April 1832\n\nNORMAN John son of William Henry & Catherine died 9 February 1848, aged 4 months.\n\nNORMAN Samuel Grundy son of William Henry and Catherine died 6 December 1850, aged 7 months.\n\nThere is also the marriage in Phillimores Marriage Index of Pentrich of a Daniel NORMAN to an Eliz. COWPER, by licence on 5 June 1759 - perhaps they could be the parents of the John NORMAN born 1760.\n\nJanet"
