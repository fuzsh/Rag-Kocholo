The State sold 49.9 percent of its shares in the airport company for a total of €341,292,805 to CASIL (China Airport Synergy Investment Limited), a company owned by a Chinese consortium comprising Shandong Hi-Speed Group and Friedmann Pacific AM. The ministerial order dated April 15, 2015 also provides that the French State has a put option for its remaining 10.01 percent of the shares in the airport company. Nevertheless, the government said it was not its intention to exercise this option.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
