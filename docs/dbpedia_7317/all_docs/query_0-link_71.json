        "text": "BY THE END OF THE 1970s, the crisis of the dominant Fordist postwar regime of accumulation had become painfully obvious across the advanced capitalist world, even if the severity and symptoms of that crisis varied from country to country. Within the labor market, Fordism came to be associated above all with a range of rigidities: in the ability to hire and fire workers; in the deployment of labor; in work organization; in skill sets; in work time; and in pay and benefits.\n\nSince the eighties, France has been experiencing high rates of unemployment, which, in comparison to certain European countries, appear to be especially hard to reduce. France is often stigmatised for the extreme rigidity of its economic framework and especially its labour market. According to these critiques, excessive protections of certain categories of employee, in particular, would hinder companies in their efforts to become more competitive and aggressive on international markets. However, in past times, France appeared more successful, precisely on the basis of a certain ability to take advantage of its propensity to protect firms and employees against market and competition processes. In the 1950s and 1960s, industrial disputes, softened by state intervention, lay the basis of a strong and lasting process of growth based on the extension of Taylorism and Fordism and on a social compromise giving employees and employers a shared access to the dividends of growth (Boyer, 1994)...\n\nW. Rand Smith compares socialist policies of industrial retrenchment in France and Spain during the 1980s and 1990s. Both governments sought to adapt their national economy to change in the global market, through investment incentives and labor policies, in a way that would avoid sectoral crisis or even collapse. They sought to achieve an “orderly exit” of labor from redundancy-plagued industrial sectors, notably steel and automobiles, through job retraining, help in establishing small businesses, relocation incentives, and improvements in the job market, not to mention such standard support mechanisms as severance payments and preretirement systems that supported the incomes of unemployed workers. There was a distinct convergence between French and Spanish policy around this kind of adaptive policy. Neither country after 1983 resisted global market trends through price controls or subsidies or trade protection, and neither government embraced market adjustment through more liberal ..."
