        "text": "So proud of Renault Group‚Äôs historical results this semester! We've reached our highest-ever operating profit at 8.1% of revenue! For more than 3 years, we‚Äôve been working hard to provide the group with outstanding flexibility. On one hand, we have Ampere, our #EV and #software champion. On the other hand, we‚Äôve built cash generating businesses for #ICE and hybrid engines, with Horse Powertrain and Power. But this is only the appetizer. In this rapidly evolving industry, we are committed to transforming our company into the most progressive European car maker, by going beyond OEM‚Äôs traditional recipes. This means addressing the new automotive value chains smartly with Mobilize and THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL, while investing in high-end technology with Alpine. On top of that, our ecosystemic approach, involving more than 20 partners, allows us to boost our agility. To turn this company into a faster animal, we also launched \"Speed of Lightness\", a program to double the execution pace of major company processes. And finally, we leverage Augmented Intelligence as a turbo that further boosts our capabilities. Many thanks to the women and men of Renault Group, to our clients, distribution partners, suppliers and shareholders. As you may expect, we‚Äôre just getting started!\n\nWhat better occasion than this #WorldEnvironmentDay to recall Renault Group's commitments? We dare and we innovate, for example when we decide to address decarbonization on our products' entire lifecycle, from cradle to grave. And we walk the talk! We have reduced the Group's overall carbon footprint by 28% between 2010 and 2023! It is the result of more than a decade of investment and work. And that puts us on track to achieve carbon neutrality in 2040 in Europe and by 2050 globally, with Ampere leading the way from 2035 onwards. Renault Group is recognized as a frontrunner also in the #circulareconomy, with decades of experience. It shows in our vehicles: our car of the year Scenic is 90% recyclable, 24% made of recycled materials. Behind the scenes, we‚Äôre building our circular value chain. In 2021 we've turned our plant of Flins into a living lab: the ReFactory. In 2022 we‚Äôve initiated THE FUTURE IS NEUTRAL: the first 360-degree circular economy enterprise in the automotive world. A new kind of enterprise, open to partners and designed to serve all automotive players with integrated solutions, including the first offer dedicated to #EVs in Europe. These solutions are already running and generated almost 1billion euros last year. But the race towards #carbonneutrality can't be a solo play. That is why we created a robust ecosystem all along our electric value chain including downstream for the end-of-life with our long-term partner SUEZ, which I met this morning. Thank you Sabrina Soussan for our insightful exchange about the challenges ahead of us and the solutions that we can provide together. The road is still long, but I believe we have all it takes to tackle mobility‚Äôs biggest challenges as a team!\n\nAs always, we are happy to explain our circular economy activities on site. ‚ôªÔ∏è üè≠ We were delighted to welcome a delegation of top executives from Mitsubishi Corporation, led by Mr Takao Kato, President and CEO, and from Nissan Motor Corporation, notably Mr Hideaki Watanabe, Chief Strategy & Corporate Affairs at the Flins #Refactory, the first industrial site in Europe dedicated to the circular economy of mobility. As part of the visit they got to see: ‚û°Ô∏èThe #GAIAAutorecycling battery repair centre of expertise: 2,400 batteries treated last year ‚û°Ô∏èThe remanufacturing activities of our newly created subsidiary #TheRemakers: 11,000 references of mechanical and electronic parts and the first European offer for #electric vehicles ‚û°Ô∏èThe #Renew factory: 34,000 used cars remanufactured since 2021 Thanks to Radut Stephane Caroline de Beaumont Jean-Philippe B. Claude Leaurnet Rafael Tr√©guer Xavier Kaufman V√©ronique Sarlat-Depotte Guido Haak Xavier Gruson for organising this visit. üòä #TheFutureIsNeutral #CircularEconomy\n\nWhat a journey the last 1000 days have been! From experiencing historical loss in 2020, we‚Äôve achieved a record operating margin of 7.9% and generated ‚Ç¨3bn of free cash flow in 2023! Today I wanted to express my gratitude to the people of Renault Group for making the #Renaulution a reality. You can all be proud of yourselves! I would also like to thank Renault Group‚Äôs board of directors for their support and our shareholders who renewed their trust in me for a second mandate. When I started the Renaulution 4 years ago, the company was at its lowest point. We started our Resurrection phase by undertaking structural work on performance, while the Renovation was about putting the product at the center of the company. We also announced that we would turn Renault Group into a next-gen automotive company, focused on a team of teams, for 5 specific sports: #EV, #software, #circulareconomy, #mobility services, and #ICE. Since then, we‚Äôve set Renault Group back where it deserves: at the forefront of innovation. In only one year, we have carved out HORSE and launched Ampere. We've also prepared the best range in 30 years, with 10 launches this year alone, and set up more than 20 partnerships. But don't count on us to stop here! With our program \"Speed of Lightness\", we aim to accelerate on a dozen key processes in our company. Thanks to this program, our new Twingo will be developed in 2 years instead of 3 or 4! I can‚Äôt wait to write the next chapter with our bold and passionate teams. Now, on to the next challenge! Check out our 2024 car lineup : https://lnkd.in/eU-iMsAN\n\nI am a headlight, but do you know what makes me special? I am the beacon that lights the way to sustainable practices! üí´ I am the embodiment of INDRA AUTOMOBILE RECYCLING's commitment to the reuse of end-of-life vehicles. Instead of being discarded, I have been revitalised and made available for purchase via a circular economy platform. An ingenious solution, reminiscent of a shining car headlight! According to ADEME, INDRA achieves a recycling and recovery rate of 96.8%, above the European standard. Ready for more revelations? Stay tuned for the unveiling of new components... #TheFutureIsNeutral #CircularEconomy #Headlight\n\nWe are delighted to introduce THE REMAKERS, our new remanufacturing venture dedicated to breathing new life into disused car parts. Welcome to the future where sustainability is the new normal! üôå THE REMAKERS, based at the Flins Refactory, is now part of The Future Is NEUTRAL‚Äôs portfolio and brings its contribution to extend the life of the products in use. This unit continues a rich heritage of expertise dating back to 1949. It consists of remanufacturing automotive components using the same industrial process as for new parts. Why is this so important? By doing so, THE REMAKERS limits the impact on virgin resources, saves energy, water and CO2 emissions, while offering customers parts that are as good as new at an average cost of 30% less. Spanning across 9 product families with over 11,000 references, from mechanical components to electronic parts, THE REMAKERS is a step ahead in the electric vehicle area, with the 1st circular economy remanufacturing offer for electric vehicles in Europe. THE REMAKERS's ambition is to become a European leader in the reconditioning of parts. We fully support this ambition as part of our commitment to develop all our activities. üöÄ Congratulations to all THE REMAKERS' team and stakeholders for bringing this new adventure to life: Rafael Tr√©guer, Patrice PARICHOUT, Thibault HUGUET, Radut Stephane, Caroline Beaumont, J√©r√©mie BRASSAUD, Xavier Kaufman and Francois Delion.
