        "text": "The French government ousted Regis Turrini as head of the state shareholding agency after less than a year in the job as it seeks to add a more industrial focus to the handling of its interests.\n\nTurrini, 56, a former deals specialist at Vivendi SA, only joined the Agence des Participations de l’Etat, or APE, in September. His departure is part of a reorganization “in line with the state’s strategy as a shareholder with a more industrial dimension,” a spokeswoman for Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron said."
