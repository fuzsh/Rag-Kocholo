        "text": "PARIS (AFP) - The French government on Thursday (Nov 2) launched the sale of a 4.73 per cent stake in automaker Renault, a state agency handling public assets said.\n\nThe sale will cut France's stake in Renault back to the 15.01 per cent level that it stood at two-and-a-half years ago, but still leaves it the automaker's biggest single shareholder.\n\nIn April 2015, the French government acquired the same 4.73 per cent stake that it is now selling to gain a blocking minority stake.\n\nAt the time, it said it would use its increased power in the company to push through measures designed to reward long-term investors, including with double voting rights.\n\nThis had now been achieved, said the Agence des Participations de l'Etat (APE), which handles state-owned shareholdings on behalf of the French government.\n\nThe stake sale, representing 14 million shares, will add much-needed cash to the coffers of the French government which is struggling to meet this year's deficit targets.\n\nBased on Renault's closing share price on the Paris bourse on Thursday it is worth over 1.2 billion euros (S$1.9 billion).\n\nThe sale is likely to be well perceived by Renault's alliance partner Nissan which took a dim view of the French government hiking its stake in 2015.\n\nRenault itself also opposed the higher stake as it aggravated long-simmering questions about whether Renault and Nissan should change their ownership stakes in each other.\n\nUnder an agreement struck in 1999 Renault owns about 43 per cent of Nissan, which holds about 15 per cent of the French's automaker's shares, but does not have voting rights."
