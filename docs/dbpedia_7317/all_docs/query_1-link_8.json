But he's really a covert capitalist.\n\nSince September, the former deals specialist from Vivendi SA has headed a French government fund that oversees $130 billion in shares in 74 companies. While serving his socialist masters, Turrini says his goal is to make the fund less of a cudgel for implementing government policies and more like any other investor, managing his holdings to maximize returns."
