        "text": "Coordinated by: Hadrien Coutant (CSO), Antoine Ducastel (ART-Dev, CIRAD) and Scott Viallet-Thévenin (CSO and LISST)\n\nProposals (1 page) should be sent to the three coordinators by the 29th of September 2019 to the following three addresses:\n\nhadrien.coutant@sciencespo.fr\n\nantoine.ducastel@cirad.fr\n\nscott.viallet-thevenin@m4x.org.\n\nThe authors of the selected proposals will send their full papers by the 2nd of February 2020.\n\nThe abstract and the paper may be written in English.\n\nA 2017 report issued by the French Cour des Comptes asked whether the French State was a “good shareholder” (Cour des Comptes, 2017). It concluded by underlining the heterogeneity of the institutions (Agence de Participation de l’état, Caisse des Dépôts et Consignation, etc.), objectives and practices that constitute the “shareholding State” and called for a greater harmonization. This report was written in a long-lasting context characterized by constant privatization operations since 1986, but also the most unfamiliar buyout by the State of shares in large failing groups – PSA, Vallourec, etc. Contrary to what happened after World War II for example (Andrieu, Le Van & Prost, 1987), the recent operations have not necessarily proposed – at least not explicitly – management practices that would differ from private firms’. What was then the purpose of these operations? Were they inly finance-oriented? These issues concern many countries beyond the French case, albeit with variations.\n\nThe “shareholding State” refers as much as to a public policy instrument – holding a firm’s equity – as to an eclectic group of actors and to institutions. It also constitutes a political “myth”.\n\nThe “shareholding State” first describes political economy government practices and techniques that rely on the holding of shares of commercial or financial firms. These equity stakes that result in an inflow of equity allow a certain control over firms – through the board – and generate revenues – dividends and gains on disposal. As well as credit granting, an equity stake is both a public policy instrument (Halpern et al., 2014) and a financial instrument. It structures a “State-centered financial circuit” (Frétigny, 2015) that enables the State irrigating and formatting the economy through the organization of the capital (Morin, 2000) or the design of industrial policies (Cohen, 1992).\n\nThe origins of the State’s equity stakes are manifold: former administrations or State departments, nationalization processes (such as 1936’s, 1945’s or 1982’s in France), support of failing groups (in France, Alstom in 2004, PSA in 2014, or, in the United Kingdom, the East Coast Line in 2018), or the intake of equity as part of a strategy of economic development – particularly towards the SMEs (BPI’s portfolio in the French case). The State buys, sells and manages equity as part of various public policies (industrial policy, environmental policy or social policy such as employment). In this special issue, we are looking for papers that analyze this instrument in specific historical and sectorial variations, but also through transversal issues.\n\nSecondly, the shareholding State is embodied in a variety of agencies and administrations in charge of the day-to-day management of the State’s equity. In the French case, the report written by the Cour des Comptes studied three “armed wings”: the Agence des Participations de l’état (APE), the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations and its subsidiary the Banque publique d’investissement (BPI). But the States owns equity though other bodies such as the development bank Agence Française de Développement that invests in firms abroad – through its subsidiary Proparco, specialized in the private sector – or regional institutions such as the Banque Publique d’Investissement. The operators of the shareholding State are neither rigid nor immutable. In the 1980’s institutions such as the sociétés de développement régionales (SDR) [regional development companies] or the Institut de développement industriel (IDI) [Institute for Industrial Development] – privatized in 1987 – were for example key actors of the public shareholding policy. Does this diversity really reflect various trade specializations, various kinds of risk or various fields of State operation? Does the functioning of these operators escape the suspicions of regulator’s capture (Scialom, 2019) or instrumentalization (Jobert & Muller, 1987)?\n\nThirdly, the historical mutations of State-owned firms regarding their shape, control mode and relationship with the administrations in charge of their monitoring have to do with the legitimacy of State intervention in the economy – and the related political ideologies. The acquisition of stakes is an important feature of the relationship between the State and the economy, and also of the “economic regime of the political order” (Théret, 1992; Gayon & Lemoine, 2010). Even if the instrument remains the same, it has been part of the evolution of the dominant development paradigms since 1945 – the political “independence” in the 1950s and 1960s (especially for newly created States), the “modernization” and planning of the economy later on, and nowadays, the balance of public accounts and sustainable development. The legitimizing work and how it is contested both shape the “representations of society and of State interventions” (Samuel, 2017).\n\nDespite its role in the public debate, the shareholding state has rarely been studied —let alone conceptualized— in social sciences. Recent studies analyze the agencies and public institutions in charge of the equity stakes of the state (Frétigny, 2015; Coutant, 2016; Viallet-Thévenin, 2016; Ducastel, 2019). But no systematic and historical analysis of this peculiar public policy can be found. Nor has the ‘shareholding state’ been investigated as a concept like it has been done in law (Delion, 2007 ; Boudet, 2013).\n\nResearch in social sciences has particularly investigated the waves of nationalizations and privatizations in order to assess their scope and characterize their causes (Clarke & Pitelis, 1993 ; Lawton-Smith, 1995 ; Clifton et al., 2006 ; Toninelli, 2000). By way of comparative studies it has shown that privatization is a political action rather than the mechanical outcome of economic logics. The existence of state-owned corporations could even stand for an indicator of the state’s involvement in economy (Feigenbaum et al., 1998). It is one of Schmidt’s (1996) or Culpepper’s (2006) evidences to characterize the transformation of the French economy from a statist to a neoliberal model. Studies in industrial economics have questioned the efficiency of this organizational form (Charreaux, 1997 ; Morin, 1996) from a financial point of view and in terms of state’s control (Cohen & Bauer, 1985). Among European countries, the idea of the return to an interventionist and planning state —although under budgetary constraints— by way of public investments and equity stakes is backed by recent results (Ansaloni & Smith, 2018 ; Mertens & Thiemann, 2018) and in Africa (Samuel, 2017).\n\nThis special issue aims to characterize the various faces of the shareholding State by putting together works in social sciences that are interested in its actors and instruments. Privileging comparisons across various operators – historical and contemporaneous – across their management and across different national economies, the contributions will question the shareholding State ways of governing firms and the economy.\n\nThe purpose of this special issue is to come to a better understanding of how financial, political and administrative issues articulate: public service objectives; balance between industrial investments and sustainable development issues; budgetary balance and financial and structural policies. To achieve that goal, we propose to identify the various organizations that constitute the shareholding State – in particular by mapping its equity stakes – and characterize the shape and content of the State’s stakes – in particular their specificities compared with private equity stakes or other States’. The historical transformations of the shareholding State are of particular interest, especially to discuss the gradual ‘financialization” (Van der Zwan, 2014) of that policy instrument.\n\nWe shall stress that the “State” is meant in a broader meaning. Papers proposal should not be limited to State administrations, but also address public local authorities.\n\nSome – non exhaustive – specific issues can fuel this investigation:\n\n1. How does the State manage its equity on a daily basis?\n\nCareers and status of the staff and organizations in charge\n\nWork division/internal organization of work\n\nCollaboration of employees of the shareholding State organizations with other stakeholders (especially private shareholders and management of the firm)\n\nObjective setting by the State; evaluation and control devices\n\nFinancing circuit between the State and State-owned firms\n\n2. Are State’s capital investments public policies?\n\nTo which public policies do these equity stakes contribute? What economic, social, fiscal policy is implemented through public ownership?\n\nHow do they interact with other public policy instruments?\n\nWhat legitimacy do these capital investments enjoy (according to their advocates)? Who contests them? To what extend do they play a part in the legitimacy of the State interventions in the economy? In its efficiency?\n\nHow do production, human resources, commercial strategies of a specific State-owned enterprise interact with portfolio management strategies and macro-economic strategies?\n\n3. How does the shareholding State fit in the administrative and political structure?"
