        "text": "In Greek mythology, Hypnos (/ËhÉªpnÉs/; Greek: á½ÏÎ½Î¿Ï, \"sleep\")[1] is the personification of sleep; the Roman equivalent is known as Somnus. His name is the origin of the word hypnosis.[2]\n\nDescription\n\nHypnos is the son of Nyx (\"The Night\") and Erebus (\"The Darkness\"). His brother is Thanatos (\"Death\"). Both siblings live in the underworld (Hades) or in Erebus, another valley of the Greek underworld. According to rumors, Hypnos lived in a big cave, which the river Lethe (\"Forgetfulness\") comes from and where night and day meet. His bed is made of ebony, on the entrance of the cave grow a number of poppies and other soporific plants. No light and no sound would ever enter his grotto. According to Homer, he lives on the island Lemnos, which later on has been claimed to be his very own dream-island. He is said to be a calm and gentle god, as he helps humans in need and, due to their sleep, owns half of their lives.[3][4]\n\nEuphronios Krater, Hermes (Psychopompos) in the Middle with the twin brothers Thanatos and Hypnos (Death and Sleep) moving Sarpedon, the son of Zeus to Hades the world of the dead. Calyx-krater, ca. 515 BC; Archaic; red-figure, Metropolitan Museum of Art Signed by Euxitheos, as potter; Signed by Euphronios, as painter, Greek, Attic ( Etruscan Sculpture )\n\nFamily\n\nHypnos lived next to his twin brother, Thanatos (ÎÎ¬Î½Î±ÏÎ¿Ï, \"death personified\") in the underworld.\n\nHypnos' mother was Nyx (ÎÏÎ¾, \"Night\"), the deity of Night, and his father was Erebus, the deity of Darkness. Nyx was a dreadful and powerful goddess, and even Zeus feared to enter her realm.\n\nNyx hides Hypnos\n\nHis wife, Pasithea, was one of the youngest of the Charites and was promised to him by Hera, who is the goddess of marriage and birth. Pasithea is the deity of hallucination or relaxation.\n\nHypnos in the Iliad\n\nHypnos and Thanatos carrying the body of Sarpedon from the battlefield of Troy; detail from an Attic white-ground lekythos, ca. 440 BC.\n\nHypnos used his powers to trick Zeus. Hypnos was able to trick him and help the Danaans win the Trojan war. During the war, Hera loathed her brother and husband, Zeus, so she devised a plot to trick him. She decided that in order to trick him she needed to make him so enamoured with her that he would fall for the trick. So she washed herself with ambrosia and anointed herself with oil, made especially for her to make herself impossible to resist for Zeus. She wove flowers through her hair, put on three brilliant pendants for earrings, and donned a wondrous robe. She then called for Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and asked her for a charm that would ensure that her trick would not fail. In order to procure the charm, however, she lied to Aphrodite because they sided on opposite sides of the war. She told Aphrodite that she wanted the charm to help herself and Zeus stop fighting. Aphrodite willingly agreed. Hera was almost ready to trick Zeus, but she needed the help of Hypnos, who had tricked Zeus once before.\n\nHera called on Hypnos and asked him to help her by putting Zeus to sleep. Hypnos was reluctant because the last time he had put the god to sleep, he was furious when he awoke. It was Hera who had asked him to trick Zeus the first time as well. She was furious that Heracles, Zeus' son, sacked the city of the Trojans. So she had Hypnos put Zeus to sleep, and set blasts of angry winds upon the sea while Heracles was still sailing home. When Zeus awoke he was furious and went on a rampage looking for Hypnos. Hypnos managed to avoid Zeus by hiding with his mother, Nyx. This made Hypnos reluctant to accept Hera's proposal and help her trick Zeus again. Hera first offered him a beautiful golden seat that can never fall apart and a footstool to go with it. He refused this first offer, remembering the last time he tricked Zeus. Hera finally got him to agree by promising that he would be married to Pasithea, one of the youngest Graces, whom he had always wanted to marry. Hypnos made her swear by the river Styx and call on gods of the underworld to be witnesses so that he would be ensured that he would marry Pasithea.\n\nHera went to see Zeus on Gargarus, the topmost peak of Mount Ida. Zeus was extremely taken by her and suspected nothing as Hypnos was shrouded in a thick mist and hidden upon a pine tree that was close to where Hera and Zeus were talking. Zeus asked Hera what she was doing there and why she had come from Olympus, and she told him the same lie she told Aphrodite. She told him that she wanted to go help her parent stop quarrelling and she stopped there to consult him because she didn't want to go without his knowledge and have him be angry with her when he found out. Zeus said that she could go any time, and that she should postpone her visit and stay there with him so they could enjoy each other's company. He told her that he was never in love with anyone as much as he loved her at that moment. He took her in his embrace and Hypnos went to work putting him to sleep, with Hera in his arms. While this went on, Hypnos travelled to the ships of the Achaeans to tell Poseidon, God of the Sea, that he could now help the Danaans and give them a victory while Zeus was sleeping. This is where Hypnos leaves the story, leaving Poseidon eager to help the Danaans. Thanks to Hypnos helping to trick Zeus, the war changed its course to Hera's favour, and Zeus never found out that Hypnos had tricked him one more time.[5]\n\nHypnos in Endymion myth\n\nAccording to a passage in Deipnosophistae, the sophist and dithyrambic poet Licymnius of Chios[6] tells a different tale about the Endymion myth, in which Hypnos, in awe of his beauty, causes him to sleep with his eyes open, so he can fully admire his face.\n\nHypnos in art\n\nHypnos appears in numerous works of art, most of which are vases. An example of one vase that Hypnos is featured on is called \"Ariadne Abandoned by Theseus,\" which is part of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston's collection. In this vase, Hypnos is shown as a winged god dripping Lethean water upon the head of Ariadne as she sleeps.[7] One of the most famous works of art featuring Hypnos is a bronze head of Hypnos himself, now kept in the British Museum in London. This bronze head has wings sprouting from his temples and the hair is elaborately arranged, some tying in knots and some hanging freely from his head.[8]\n\nSleep and hist half brother Death, Waterhouse\n\nHypnos, Tivoli Massimo\n\nHypnos British Museum\n\nWords derived from Hypnos\n\nThe English word \"hypnosis\" is derived from his name, referring to the fact that when hypnotized, a person is put into a sleep-like state (hypnos \"sleep\" + -osis \"condition\").[9] The class of medicines known as \"hypnotics\" which induce sleep also take their name from Hypnos.\n\nThe 97th PokÃ©mon, Hypno, derives from Hypnos, as one of its signature move puts others to sleep.\n\nAdditionally, the English word \"insomnia\" comes from the name of his Latin counterpart, Somnus. (in- \"not\" + somnus \"sleep\"),[10] as well as a few less-common words such as \"somnolent\", meaning sleepy or tending to cause sleep and hypersomnia meaning excessive sleep, which can be caused by many conditions (known as secondary hypersomnia) or a rare sleep disorder causing excessive sleep with unknown cause, called Idiopathic Hypersomnia.[11]\n\nSarpedon's body carried by Hypnos and Thanatos (Sleep and Death), while Hermes watches, Attic red-figured calyx-krater signed by Euxitheos (potter) and Euphronios (painter)\n\nThanatos (Death) and Hypnos (Sleep) carry the body of the dead Sarpedon to Lycia, Johann Heinrich FÃ¼ssli\n\nSee also\n\nAergia, a goddess of sloth and attendant of Hypnos\n\nTheogony\n\nMorpheus, god of dreams\n\nNyx, goddess of the night\n\nHypnos, a short story written by H.
