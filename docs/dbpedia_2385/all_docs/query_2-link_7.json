Mattusch, Classical bronzes (Cornell University Press, 1996)īronze head of Hypnos (god of sleep), 1st - 2nd century AD, copy of a Hellenistic original, found at Civitella d'Arno (near Perugia, Italy), British Museum, London Walters, Catalogue of bronzes, Greek, R (London, 1899)Ĭ.C.\n\nBronze head of hypnos series#\n\nThis head shows how wings sprouted from his temples, and his hair was elaborately arranged into a series of luxurious locks, some falling freely, others tied in a knot at the back of the head. He was shown running forwards, holding poppies in his right hand and a drinking-horn in his left, from which presumably he poured a sleeping potion. The statue type represented Hypnos either as an adolescent or, in some variants, as an even younger child. This bronze head belongs with a series of similar heads and figures found mostly in the western Mediterranean, particularly in France, Italy and Spain. His son was Morpheus, the personification of dreams.Īlthough he was frequently shown in vase painting, sculptural representations of Hypnos were rare.\n\nHypnos' wings allowed him to move swiftly over land and sea, and to fan the foreheads of the weary until they fell asleep. The god was frequently mentioned in literary sources, and associated with poppies and sleep-inducing herbs. Hypnos was, however, generally viewed as benevolent to mankind. Hypnos first appears in mythology in the works of one of the earliest Greek poets, Hesiod (lived around 700 BC), where Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death) were the terrible sons of Nyx (Night).
