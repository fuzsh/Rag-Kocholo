        "text": "Here’s my latest painting; it’s called 'The Hypnos Bedroom' and it shows a room in my house. This painting isn’t named after the manufacturer of the bed that you see but because of the ancient Greek bronze that’s behind it. The painting is oil on canvas and it measures 60 x 60 cm. This is not a good photo of it, dark and shiny paintings are notoriously difficult to photograph, but it’s the best I can do for the moment. Inspired by Vermeer, my cue to paint this didn’t just come from the magic and mystery of his paintings but also from the old advice that’s often given to creative writer’s – ‘write about what you know about’ and he must have known the interiors he painted very well. There’s nothing more familiar to any of us than our own home or our own face, and if you look carefully at this painting you’ll see both. This painting will be for sale once it’s been varnished and framed and after I’ve had it professionally photographed, but this won’t be for a while, maybe not until the next Chichester Open Studio event in May this year (q.v. chichesteropenstudios.org). I haven’t worked out its price yet but I will try to keep the price down as much as possible. As always, please remember two things – firstly that this is my job and not a hobby, and secondly whatever price it is this’ll be far cheaper if you buy it from me directly than if you bought a painting of such quality from a gallery or dealer!"
