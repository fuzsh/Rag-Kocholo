        "text": "This slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nPortraits of a Child I & II\n\nI scanned two privately held, traditional busts of children and remixed them with two powerful, otherworldy, and futuristic sculptures I admire: Constantin Brancusi’s 1910 Sleeping Muse at the Met, and Jacob Epstein’s 1915 Portrait of Iris Beerbohm Tree at Tate Britain.\n\nOnce the busts of the children were scanned, I digitally edited them to incorporate features and styling from the century-old museum pieces, which I modeled by eye from photo references. I 3D printed the results in plastic and finished them in bright and patinated brass.\n\nI’m not sure what it says about my own perception, or about the current (stale?) state of science fiction imagery, but the futuristic iconography that most resonates with me is from futures conceived long ago. William Gibson giving up on predicting the future comes to mind, and fits into the picture somehow. I also think of Disneyland restyling Tomorrowland, moving away from a 1960s brute-force engineered future, and toward hundred-year-old Jules Vernesque fantasy imagery.\n\nIn any case, the surreal, Promethean spread of creative power via easy 3D scanning and printing hints at very cool, unpredictable things to come.\n\n.\n\nLife-size 3D Printed Portrait\n\nMy client asked for a life-sized 3D printed portrait of a colleague. Because the portrait was to be a surprise gift, there was no opportunity to scan the subject. The piece had to be modeled from photos of him culled from the web.\n\nI proposed a bust, roughly from the shoulders up, with classical allusions, but I was vague about the details beyond that. The final design references the Artemision Bronze, Leighton’s An Athlete Wrestling with a Python at Tate Britain, and a few pop culture sources.\n\nI took a risk and bet that they’d like something other than a standard chairman-of-the-board type treatment. And what’s the point of having rock & roll hair if you aren’t going to do the whole heroic barbarian-warrior-champion-god thing when you have your life-size 3D printed portrait done?\n\nThis is the result.\n\nThis kind of remixing is just one small reason the world’s back catalog of public domain sculptural artwork should be digitized and published, freely, and without restriction. More on that front soon…\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n.\n\nEric Gill, ‘Ecstasy’, 1910-1\n\nI captured Gill’s 1910 limestone Ecstasy at Tate Britain in August 2012, and have cast it in bright bronze, 21 inches tall.\n\nSee 3D Scanning, 3D Printing, Bronze Casting, and the Art of the Living Dead for its story.\n\nDownload the 3D printable model here: thingiverse.com/thing:528162\n\n.\n\nThe Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\n\nShark, glass, silicone, plastic, 1.5% Red Bull solution\n\n30 x 15 x 20 cm\n\nThis original work is offered for sale directly from the artist’s studio, and will be delivered to the buyer by the artist himself (pending helipad proximity). Serious inquiries only, please.\n\nDownload the 3D printable model here: thingiverse.com/thing:25339\n\n.\n\nOctober 27, 2013\n\nThese pieces will be on display in a gallery space at the shows:\n\nVenus de Milo, 130 BCE\n\n1850 plaster cast by the Louvre atelier, 3D captured in the Skulpturhalle Basel museum 9/2013\n\nThis print of Venus de Milo is derived from my recent 3D capture of the Skulpturhalle Basel museum’s 1850 plaster cast of the original. That high quality cast, likely made by the Louvre’s own atelier, was part of a vibrant 19th century tradition of museums, universities, art schools, and wealthy collectors buying and trading plaster reproductions of famous works from each other so that they could be seen by larger audiences. That tradition is about to be brought back to life — when I publish my 3D capture and 3D printable files of Venus de Milo, anyone will be able to print their own copy.\n\nMaterials: PLA plastic with patinated copper finish\n\n.\n\nWinged Victory of Samothrace, 200 BCE\n\n1892 plaster cast by the Louvre atelier, 3D captured in the Skulpturhalle Basel museum 9/2013\n\nThis print of Nike, Winged Victory of Samothrace is derived from my recent 3D capture of the Skulpturhalle Basel museum’s plaster cast of the original. That high quality cast was made by the Louvre atelier in 1892, and was one of the most popular plasters to be collected by museums, universities, art schools, and wealthy collectors around the world. Now that Winged Victory has been unveiled here as a 3D print, I will publish my 3D capture and 3D printable files, and she’ll be unleashed for everyone to enjoy.\n\nMaterials: PLA plastic with patinated copper finish\n\n.\n\nGetty Villa Caligula in Bronze, 40 AD\n\nMarble original 3D captured at the Getty Villa, 11/2012\n\nIn early 2013, I produced a life-size bronze adaptation of my capture of the Getty Villa’s marble portrait of Caligula. In the onscreen design, I added a fracture to his neck to match that of the Met’s bronze portrait of his grandfather, Marcus Agrippa. I also deleted his eyes. When a bronze or marble has its eyes intact, the viewer can put themselves in the center of the sculpture’s field of view, as though it were looking back at them. The overall effect is proximity and familiarity. But when the eyes are lost, the piece never looks back. It is always looking through, or past, the observer. The subject becomes distant and enigmatic, even glamourous. Or perhaps dead, ghostly, or lost — a vacant, uninhabited shell of what once was, suggesting a previous life. It becomes an artifact.\n\nMaterial: Bronze\n\n.\n\nColossal Bust of Ramesses II / Ozymandias, 1250 BCE\n\nGranite original 3D captured at the British Museum, 11/2012\n\nI digitally cut away the damaged surfaces of my 3D capture of the British Museum’s famous Ramesses II, The Younger Memnon, the size, face, and incompleteness of which were the inspiration for Shelley’s Ozymandias. The pretty design is 3,200 years old, originally part of a mortuary temple in Thebes. All involved in its creation are long dead, unable to interfere with or protest its reuse and new life as data, plastic, or bronze. I printed and cast only the intact parts, creating a decorative bronze bauble, broken and patinated with age, worn bright where it has been touched.\n\nMaterial: Bronze\n\n.\n\n“Ecstasy” by Eric Gill, 1910\n\nHoptonwood stone original 3D captured in the Tate Britain, 8/2012\n\n“Death plus seventy years” is the magic spell that buries most art from the modern era along with its creators. Fortunately, if that’s the right way to put it, Eric Gill has been dead just long enough for all his work to have passed out of limbo and into the public domain. He’s been dead since 1940, so his work no longer has to be buried with him, or confined to a single place, instance, or iteration — or displayed in mausoleum-like museums. I captured Gill’s 1910 limestone Ecstasy at the Tate Britain in August 2012, and have given it a new life in bronze.\n\nFrom Lost PLA Bronze Casting and the Art of the Living Dead\n\nBy Cosmo Wenman\n\nMaterial: Bronze\n\n.\n\nSketch of Perikles’ Helmet, 2nd century AD\n\nModelled after the original marble Portrait of Perikles 3D captured in the British Museum, 8/2012\n\nI made a quick 3D capture of the British Museum’s Marble portrait bust of Perikles. I used the results as a template, taking its measurements and contours as a guide in order to design this rough 3D printed sketch of his helmet, making a copy of an artifact that has never been discovered.\n\nMaterials: PLA plastic with patinated bronze and brass finish.\n\n.\n\n“Georges Méliès” by Renato Carvillani, 1951\n\n“Créateur du spectacle cinématographique”\n\nBronze original 3D captured in Père Lachaise Cemetery, 11/2012\n\nI scanned several graves in Père Lachaise cemetery, Paris, in October, 2012. There are so many incredible sculptures to choose from there, monuments to incredible people. This one is special — the verdigris bronze bust by Renato Carvillani that graces the grave of French illusionist and cinematography pioneer Georges Méliès — the father of special effects and science fiction movies. It seems fitting to render him in a new medium.\n\nMaterials: PLA plastic with patinated bronze finish.\n\n.\n\nThese pieces will be on display at Autodesk’s exhibit:\n\nThe Inopos / Alexander the Great, circa 100 BCE\n\nMarble original 3D captured at the Louvre, 11/2012\n\nOriginally thought to represent the Cycladic river god Inopos, the nearly one meter tall fragmented bust known as “The Inopos” is now accepted as a portrait of Alexander the Great. If the full figure had survived intact, it would stand at well over eight feet tall—god scale. At the Louvre, the imposing, larger-than-life figure hides in plain sight, largely unnoticed, staring down at the crowds that flock to see the Venus de Milo just twenty feet away.\n\nI captured the original in the Louvre in October 2012 and digitally restored its damaged nose using a nose I captured from a portrait of Alexander at the British Museum.\n\nFrom 3D Printed Portraiture: Past, Present, and Future\n\nBy Cosmo Wenman\n\nMaterials: PLA plastic with patinated bronze finish.\n\n.\n\nHead of a Horse of Selene, from the Parthenon, 438-432 BCE\n\nMarble original 3D captured at the British Museum, 8/2012\n\nI originally printed this horse and finished it in metal, in an effort to show that consumer-grade 3D printers can produce objects of art worthy of display. I made it life-size because I thought doing so would be jarring; it would help break consumer-grade 3D printing out of the toy and trinket realm and make it all seem more real somehow.\n\nBut I chose this and a few other archetypical subjects (like Alexander the Great) in particular to try to advance the idea that with 3D scanning and 3D printing, private collectors and museums have an opportunity to turn their collections into living engines of cultural creation. They can digitize their three-dimensional collections and project them outward into the public realm to be adapted, multiplied, and remixed.\n\nIf I can do it with just a camera and some free software, the Getty, the Met, the British Museum, or the Louvre–or a wealthy collector–can do it too. In fact, they’ve already done a lot of the scanning, they just haven’t done much of the publishing. But they should, in my opinion, because these technologies offer a way to break great art out of mausoleum-like settings, and put them where they can come alive and reach and influence many more people, in a vibrant, lively, and anarchic popular culture.\n\nMaterials: PLA plastic with patinated brass finish.\n\n."
