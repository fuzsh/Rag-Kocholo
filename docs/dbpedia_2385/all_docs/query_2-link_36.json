        "meta_description": "The Bronze Statue of Sleeping Eros in the Metropolitan Museum has long been recognized as one of the finest bronze statues to survive from antiquity. It was first published by Gisela Richter as an original Hellenistic sculpture or very close replica dated between 250 and 150 B.C. Many subsequent scholars tend to agree with Richter’s assessment although not her precise dating. Others believe it to be a very fine Roman copy of one of the most popular sculptures ever made in Roman Imperial times known from hundreds of copies, variants and adaptations. This article presents a new assessment based on careful scientific and technical examinations of the statue itself and a close study of other existing sculptures of this type. The research supports Richter’s identification of the statue as a Hellenistic work, but also makes apparent that it was restored in antiquity, most likely in the Early Imperial period. Consideration of the cult and mythology of Eros, other major Late Classical and Hellenistic sculptures, as well as the different meanings of the Sleeping Eros in later periods, enable a more cogent understanding of the original display of the Metropolitan Museum’s bronze statue of Sleeping Eros and its significance in antiquity.",

        "text": "The Mythology and Iconography of Eros\n\nThe Place of the New York Sleeping Eros in the Replica Series – Its Original Date of Manufacture and Provenance\n\nScientific and Technical Analysis\n\n5Gisela Richter offered some comments about how the Sleeping Eros was made but since the publication of her study, seventy years ago, practically no technical analysis had been done. The present study, utilizing X-radiography, chemical and metallographic analyses, non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analyses, and careful visual examination after new cleaning of parts of the interior presents a more accurate understanding of how the statue was made. Of particular importance is the discovery that a large section of the drapery appears to have been restored in antiquity, likely during the Roman Imperial period.\n\n7The left arm of the statue is broken just above where it was joined in antiquity near the shoulder. Considerable excess metal visible on the interior near the break has a green patina and is likely remains of flow weld metal used to join the arm in antiquity. Since the statue is open at the bottom, it is in many ways like a deep relief (see fig. 3). Consequently, the founder had unusual access to the interior of the statue, enabling him to join the head, legs and right wing to the body from the inside instead of the outside as was more typically necessary. This condition helps to explain the economy of metal used in the joins of the statue. The head is attached only along part of the back of the neck by what must be a flow weld that has very little excess metal. Narrow gaps were left open on the underside of the chin and part of the back. The slightly rougher surface at the back of the neck may be an indication of this join on the exterior. After the recent cleaning, the excess metal of the flow weld join between the body and the left leg is clearly visible on the interior as is part of the edge of the two cast sections at the join. A similar join is visible on the right leg with less excess metal visible. Likewise, the location of the weld used to attach the top of the right wing and a second weld near the tip of the wing are clearly visible from the interior. The smooth splattered metal of the weld near the tip of the wing looks like it was poured from within and must have overflowed around the area of the join thus creating a broader bond on the interior.\n\nTable 1. Chemical analysis of seven samples from the Metropolitan’s Bronze Statue of Sleeping Eros (weight %)\n\nReconstructing the Missing Parts of the Sleeping Eros Statue\n\nA New Genre: Representations of Sleep in Hellenistic Sculpture\n\n25The varied sculptural monuments of sleeping figures from the Hellenistic period demonstrate that Greek artists were interested in exploring sleep as an altered state of consciousness – its different manifestations as well as its consequences. Like the Sleeping Eros, most of the statues appear to have been free-standing works that did not require additional sculptures. Arguably, the most successful of these Hellenistic representations was the Sleeping Eros, of which many more copies survive than of any other sleeping types. It is not possible to date any of these statues with precision, but it is tempting to see the Sleeping Eros as the earliest representation of this genre and, in spite of its charming conceit, it is also in many ways the most radical.\n\nInterpretation in Light of Later Images of Eros Sleeping\n\n31The notion of art history was first introduced by Hellenistic Greeks. Its study was cultivated at great centers of learning, Alexandria and Pergamon, for example, established through the patronage of the Hellenistic kings, as well as at Athens. The sculptor of the original Sleeping Eros would have been well aware of statues of the god from earlier periods in Greek art. The contrast between Lysippos’s statue, where Eros is stringing his bow in preparation for action, and the Sleeping Eros may well have been intentional. Whereas references to Praxiteles’s statue of Eros emphasize the god’s ardent gaze, the sculptor of the Sleeping Eros achieved a masterpiece in which the eyes of the god are not even open.\n\nConclusion\n\n36Like Caravaggio’s Sleeping Cupid, the Metropolitan’s Sleeping Eros would have looked incredibly life-like to the ancient viewer (fig. 1). Part of the success of the statue is the way the sleeping figure draws in the viewer to become a part of the scene as he or she looks down at this loveliest of heavenly creatures. They say that children look like angels when they sleep. The artist of the Sleeping Eros has captured that serenity and beauty. Remarkably enough, with its widespread usage in Roman times, the Sleeping Eros is likely to have been one of the major inspirations for the cherubs and putti that become so prevalent in Renaissance and later art. The sleep of the Metropolitan’s bronze Eros is not the troubled sleep of the Hermaphrodite or Sleeping Ariadne. The god of love is at peace and the pure innocence of love is clearly represented. Although the quiver around his neck and the presence of his bow allude to his ability to wound, it is not the side of Eros that wins out in this representation. While it is a most unusual representation for a deity, there is precedent for the notion of a sleeping Eros in the myth of Eros and Psyche. The sculpture became one of the most popular sculptural types in Roman times, displayed in baths and nymphaeums as part of fountains as well as in private villas, even tavernas and as funerary monuments.\n\n37Comparison of the Metropolitan’s Sleeping Eros with other extant examples of the New York type shows it to be a work apart – one of the highest quality. However, the other replicas enable us to restore in the mind’s eye the missing elements of the composition, notably the bow and quiver, the placement of the left arm and the missing drapery. The technical analysis proves the statue to be a tour de force of craftsmanship, expertly restored in antiquity, possibly after damages occurred to the drapery between the legs. The repairs may have been made as late as the Early Imperial period given the high lead content of the drapery. When the statue was first made in the Hellenistic period, probably in the 3rd century B.C., the Sleeping Eros was most likely a religious dedication set up at a sanctuary like the famous bronze Eros by Lysippos (see fig. 2) dedicated at Thespiae in Boeotia. In later times, it could have remained in its original location or been removed as a valuable antique Greek sculpture and displayed in a private setting such as a Roman villa.\n\nSeán Hemingway wishes to thank Thomas P.
