She played in many other television serials, including Wild, Wild Women, Doctor Who and Z Cars. From its inception until her death in 1983 she played the part of Maud, the eccentric housekeeper, in the Hinge and Bracket radio series.

During the 1950s and 1960s she was a member of the teaching staff at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.

She died in 1983 in Bristol, aged 78.
