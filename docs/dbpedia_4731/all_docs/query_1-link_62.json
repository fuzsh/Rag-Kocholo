        "text": "Tomorrow is my wedding anniversary so my thoughts go to love - and to marriage. There are many different kinds of love. According to where you look, there are 3, 4, 7, 8, or 12 types of love, but we mostly hear about these three:\n\nAgape — Unconditional Love. This one is hard for mere mortals. We like to think that God loves us unconditionally, and we hope that parents will love their children unconditionally.\n\nEros — Romantic Love. This seems to be hard for a lot of people to master, as well, but it is a topic that dominates advice columns, books, movies, and popular songs.\n\nPhilia — Affectionate Love, love between friends. The ancient Greeks thought this kind of love was better than eros (sexual love), because it represented love between people who considered themselves equals. This doesn't seem to be any easier than the other forms of love. Sadly, BFFs end up in plenty of toxic relationships.\n\nThe good news is that love works out quite beautifully, quite often.\n\nHere are some lovely books (and a movie):\n\nAmour DVD F AMO\n\nCyrano /McCaughrean, Geraldine.
