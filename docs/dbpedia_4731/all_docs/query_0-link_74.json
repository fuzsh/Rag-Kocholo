        "text": "More is more in the restaurant business. Open one restaurant, and then go back for seconds, and thirds and, in the case of Stephen Starr, 37ths.\n\nMy crystal ball of new restaurants for 2024 is alight with more than 75 projects, and most are from people expanding their empires.\n\nFelicia Wilson and chef Darryl Harmon of Amina are about to open their second restaurant and have two more on the books. Chloe Grigri and Vincent Stipo of the Good King Tavern, le Caveau, and Superfolie are coming to East Passyunk Avenue with a French market/wine bar. Davide Lubrano and Vinny Gallagher of Rittenhouse hole-in-the-wall Pizzata Pizzeria are adding a bar and a dining room on East Passyunk. Fishtown’s Fabrika is opening a new spot up the block, showcasing Georgian cuisine. Chef Tyler Akin of Wilmington’s Le Cavalier is also branching out, heading back to Fishtown. Dumpling darling Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao is expanding to King of Prussia and University City. Joe Beddia and his partners from Defined Hospitality (Suraya, Kalaya, Condesa) have something new cooking in Kensington. Amma’s, the South Indian destination, is eyeing two additional suburban locations. Russ Cowan of Famous 4th Street Deli thinks he’ll pop the lox on the front door of Radin’s Deli in Cherry Hill in February.\n\n“Why are you opening more places?” I asked Jason Evenchik, who has at least three more bars planned for 2024.\n\n“If we don’t, someone else will,” he said.\n\nNewcomers are making a go of ownership, too, including Tam Dang and Raquel Villanueva Dang with the Filipino market/cafe Baby’s Kusina & Market in Brewerytown, and chef Nicholas Bazik with the posh French-seafood Provenance on Head House Square.\n\nThe 2024 lineup also includes a new home in South Philadelphia for Kampar (formerly Sate Kampar); the expanded Dizengoff in Rittenhouse; the rebuilt Tequila’s; the rebuilt and expanded Jim’s Steaks; the steakhouse 9 Prime in West Chester; and a Mediterranean restaurant in Rittenhouse from the Schulson Collective.\n\nOverall, the scene seems to be thriving — e.g. openings are outpacing closings, just as they did last year. Fishtown, Kensington, and Rittenhouse are retaining their cachet, as is South Philadelphia.\n\nFun is the theme, at least in Center City. Barcade just opened with its bar-arcade theme, to be followed by Flight Club (darts), Puttshack (golf), and Beat the Bomb (escape room).\n\nIt’s too soon to discuss some far-off restaurants. The team from CookNSolo is deflecting questions about a restaurant, possibly called Jaffa, planned for a former Kensington firehouse. The crew from Pub & Kitchen is hashing out its plans for the former Lou Bird’s across the street at 20th and Lombard Streets. I’ve heard of two restaurants coming to Chestnut Hill, including a new use of the Wells Fargo Bank building at Germantown and Evergreen Avenues. There is something new cooking at the former Bourbon Blue in Manayunk, and at the former Hook & Master in Kensington. That huge development with a food hall, Laurent Tourondel restaurant, and Gertie’s deli at the Piazza Alta in Northern Liberties is about a year away. Starr’s still-unnamed Italian restaurant at the former Barnes & Noble store on Rittenhouse Square likely won’t open before December. Eataly’s debut at King of Prussia Mall, where it will replace the former Rite Aid and Forever 21, is not due to open before 2025.\n\nHere’s a list of what’s coming in 2024, and a few things that opened in the last week of 2023. Opening dates are rough guidelines only.\n\nAVANA (2200 Ben Franklin Parkway): Felicia Wilson and chef Darryl Harmon have much on their plate, including Amina in Old City and the soon-to-open BlackHen, and the just-announced Amina Ocean. They’re also headed to the former, short-lived Hadley in the east tower of Park Towne Place on the Parkway for a 200-seat American restaurant whose name is Swahili for “beautiful flower.” March\n\nThe Cormorant (2301 Frankford Ave.): This is the working name of a Kensington neighborhood bar replacing Bob’s Happy Hour Tavern at Frankford Avenue and Dauphin Street by Vintage Syndicate, the crew behind such spots as Time, Heritage, Starbolt, and Vintage. Late spring\n\nILU (2118 Dauphin St.): Vintage Syndicate is also behind a changeover of Kensington’s former Old Philadelphia Bar into a cocktail bar with Spanish tapas. Partner Patrick Iselin, who is Spanish, joined Jason Evenchik on a recent scouting trip to Madrid. Evenchik said ILU doesn’t mean “I love you” — it’s the nickname of Iselin’s grandmother Iluminada. Other partners include Scott Coudriet (of Lloyd) and Sal D’Amato. Early fall\n\nKilimandjaro (4223 Chestnut St.): This is a comeback for Senegalese-born chef Youma Ba, whose West African restaurant at this location was demolished for a new, mixed-use building. In the meantime, she opened Youma, a cozy 12-seater, seven blocks away. She’ll keep Youma and add this new version of Kilimandjaro, which will have 80 seats and a larger menu. Spring\n\nKinto (1144 Frankford Ave.): Most of the crew from Fishtown’s cabaret/restaurant Fabrika (Nataliya Matkivski, with Lasha Kikvidze, Alex Gritsyuk, Boris Khanataev) is behind what is shaping up to be a snazzy but far-more-low-key Georgian bar-restaurant, with an extensive Georgian wine list, in a new building just up the block. The name refers to the long-ago entertainers found in Georgian restaurants. Executive chef Georgi Lobzhanidze, in his U.S. debut, is stocking his menu with such dishes as ajapsandali, beef kharcho, chkmeruli, pkhali, and khinkali. Early 2024\n\nPicnic (2421 Martha St.): The crew from Defined Hospitality and pizza whisperer Joe Beddia aren’t sharing much about their new Kensington restaurant, which is coming together in the former Weisbrod & Hess Brewery. Spring\n\nPizzata Birreria (1700 E. Passyunk Ave.): Davide Lubrano and Vinny Gallagher of Rittenhouse’s top-rated Pizzata Pizzeria are taking over LaScala’s Birra at 12th and Morris Streets for a second location, and it will kick them up to the big leagues with a full bar and seating. Menu will include Italian dishes, as well as 12-inch and 16-inch pizzas, and slices to go. Mid- to late January\n\nShiso Noodle Bar (604 South St.): Alan Su (Nom Nom Ramen, Umami Steak & Sushi Bar) is taking over the former Serpico on South Street with an open-kitchen noodle bar, with a liquor license. His focus will be on Japanese noodles such as soba, udon, and ramen. Late January\n\nSuperette (1538 E. Passyunk Ave.): The former Primal Supply Meats shop will become a neighborhood market, bottle shop, and wine bar inspired by French épiceries from Chloe Grigri, Vincent Stipo, and the team behind The Good King Tavern, le Caveau, and Superfolie as well as restaurateur and Good King designer Owen Kamihira (El Camino Real and the forthcoming Joe & Kay). It will be open from lunchtime through apéro for grab-and-go and dine-in service. They call it “a place where you can pit stop for seasonal produce and a hunk of cheese on the way home, or shuffle to the counter for a splash of wine and a snack in the middle of an afternoon.” Spring\n\nUrbanspace (3101 Market St.): The former Bulletin Building across from 30th Street Station, a.k.a. the Brandywine Realty Trust’s Schuylkill Yards development, will house a food hall with room for 16 national and local vendors, none of whom have been named. TBD\n\nAl Pastor (13 W. Benedict Ave., Havertown): Delco offshoot of Exton’s modern Mexican bar. Spring\n\nAmma’s South Indian Cuisine, with two locations in Philadelphia and one in Voorhees, has two more on the way: 7000 Midlantic Drive in Mount Laurel (spring) and at Goodnoe Corner, the former Zoes Kitchen at Route 532 and Durham Road in Newtown, Bucks County (summer).\n\nCantina Feliz in Fort Washington will move to nearby Ambler to take over for the Lucky Well. Cantina Feliz will remain in place until the new space is ready at 111 E. Butler Ave. Spring\n\nCarina Sorella (864 W. Lancaster Ave., Bryn Mawr): The team from Center City’s Trattoria Carina and Pub & Kitchen is headed to the Main Line for an Italian restaurant with a 15-seat bar and pizza oven. Early spring\n\nChicken Guy (King of Prussia Mall): Chef Kevin “Steek” Cooper, who won the Guy’s Chance of a Lifetime show last year, will run Guy Fieri’s forthcoming Chicken Guy stand in King of Prussia.

Late April\n\nHoneygrow (500 W. Germantown Pike, Plymouth Meeting): The Philly-born salad/stir-fry chain will expand more in 2024, including a Lancaster location in late 2024.

March\n\nTesta Rossa (919 Baltimore Pike, Glen Mills): Fearless Restaurants had planned to open a second location of its stylish Wayne Italian restaurant Rosalie in the former Ruby’s Diner at the Shoppes at Brinton Lake in Glen Mills.

Spring\n\nAngelo’s Pizza in Berlin, Camden County, is fixing to move to a new building two minutes away at 168 Haddon Ave., West Berlin. Owner Sal Cusumano then says he will revive his long-held plans to open the artisan Pizzeria Cusumano in Collingswood. (Note that this Angelo’s has other locations only in Voorhees and Riverside.) January\n\nDolsot House (3747 Church Rd., Mount Laurel): Craig Vogt will bring tabletop Korean barbecue cooking and sushi to a former Korean restaurant space next to Mount Laurel Wine & Spirits.
