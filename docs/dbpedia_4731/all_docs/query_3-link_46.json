Her voice is the only part of herself she will give to him. When she dies, the house falls into ruin. The prince’s son, despising his father’s unconsummated attachment to the singer, builds the Bibighar, meaning “house of women\" (Part 3: p. 138)--where he keeps his own private brothel, a mile away. The selfish, dissipated son is a bad ruler and comes to a bad end.\n\nLearn more from Sister Ludmila's account: \"They [the Bibighar and MacGregor House] are only one mile distant. Not far, but far enough for a girl running at night” (Part 3: p. 138). She alludes to Daphne Manners' rape: “…after that day in August 1942, the names Bibighar and MacGregor become special ones. They passed into our language with new meanings” (139).\n\nEarly - Mid 19th century: The decayed house of the singer is rebuilt by a Scottish merchant called MacGregor, said to fear God, favor Muslims, and fear Indian temples. The house becomes known as the MacGregor House--a house of the white. MacGregor burned the Bibighar to the ground, according to British versions of the story, because it had been an abomination. The Indian version maintains that MacGregor fell in love with one of the Indian girls in the Bibighar, but he retrieves a young white woman from England to become his bride and has the MacGregor House built for her: Janet MacGregor. Meanwhile, the Indian woman spurned MacGregor for a \"black\" Indian lover, so MacGregor kills them both and destroys the Bibighar by fire.\n\nLearn more: Sister Ludmila discusses the history of the Bibighar and the MacGregor House (Part 3: 138, 140-142);\n\nLater, MacGregor, his young bride Janet, and their newly born child are murdered by mutinous Indian Sepoys (members of the British Indian army)--and the MacGregor's Muslim servant Akbar Hossain dies defending his mistress (Part 2: p. 68).\n\n[Historical Notes: Raj = Hindi for \"rule,\" refers to British colonial rule over India. The British deliberately followed a policy of “divide and rule” in India, which exploited and increased internal conflicts such as those between Hindus and Muslims (as well as Sikhs in the Punjab). The British favored the Muslims and the Islam religion, over the Hindus and Hinduism (which the British considered “weaker”).\n\nLearn more about the history of British-Indian relations from Cora's Hum 210 Asian Timelines of India:\n\nIndia Timeline 3: The British Raj (17th - early 20th c.):\n\nhttp://www.cocc.edu/cagatucci/classes/hum210/tml/IndiaTML/indiatml3.htm\n\nIndia Timeline 4: Independence of India and Pakistan (20th c.)\n\nhttp://www.cocc.edu/cagatucci/classes/hum210/tml/IndiaTML/indiatml4.htm\n\nThe ghost of Janet MacGregor is believed to haunt the MacGregor House, and, after 1943, another ghost seems to have joined her-- according to the unnamed Narrator: MacGregor House echoes with unaccountable sounds of the clumsy young Daphne Manners breaking glass, clumping about in her sensible boots, violating flower beds, nervously chattering, and singing pre-WWII popular songs.\n\nSister Ludmila also speaks of the “special connection between the house of the singer [MacGregor House] and the house of the courtesans [Bibighar]”: between then “have flowed the dark currents of a human conflict, even after the Bibighar was destroyed, a current whose direction might be traced by following the route taken by the girl running in the darkness from one to the other. A current. The flow of an invisible river. No bridge was ever thrown across it and stood. You understand what I am telling you? That MacGregor and Bibighar are the place of the white and the place of the black? To get from one to the other you could not cross by a bridge but had to take your courage in your hands and enter the flood and let yourself be taken with it, lead where it may. This is a courage Miss Manners had” (Part 3: p. 142).\n\n1885: Edwina Crane is born in London “of moderately well-to-do middle-class parents” (7).\n\n1888: Duleep Kumar (Hari Kumar’s father) is born, “the youngest of a family of four boys and three girls,” the baby and last born son (Part 5: p. 203). In India, he completes Government Higher School; at age 16 [in 1904?], he enters Government College, which he family considered “as waste of time” (Part 5; p. 204). Duleep develops three goals: “to break away from a landlocked family tradition,” to become a man who granted rather than received favors, “and to save Shalini [his younger sister] from the ignorance and domestic tyranny” typically forced upon Indian women (Part 5; p. 204). He also appreciates the importance of learning to speak proper English (205-206).\n\n1899 (?): Shalini Kumar, younger sister of Duleep Kumar and aunt of Hari Kumar, is born (Part 5; p. 204).\n\n1906 or 1907 (?): Edwina Crane comes out to India employed by the Nesbitt-Smiths as nanny to their children (7, 8).\n\n1907 (?): At age 19, Duleep Kumar wants to go to England—“passage across the black water”—to take his Indian Civil Service examinations (206-207). But before his family allows him to go, they arrange his marriage to Kamala Prasad (Part 5; pp. 207-209). He marries, then goes to England, but his first experience there as a foreigner, is depressing. He returns to India, “a half-man—unclean by traditional Hindu standards and custom because I had crossed the black water” (217) and laboring “under the weight of many burdens” (215).\n\n1909 (?): Edwina Crane decides to stay on India after she learns that Major Nesbitt-Smith’s regiment has been recalled to England (Part 1: pp. 10-13). She is employed as a teacher in the School of the Church of England Mission in Muzzafirabad (18).\n\n[Miss Edwina Crane will become supervisor of Mayapore district Church of England mission schools, self-described [in indirect narration] as \"a teacher without real qualifications, a missionary worker who did not believe in God,\" who had \"never been wholly accepted by Indians and had tended to reject the generality of the English\" (4-5). She is \"an intelligent and perceptive woman\" with pro-Indian sympathies, in India for 35 years (7).]\n\n1913-1916: Duleep Kumar’s wife Kamala bears three daughters, none of whom survive past the age of one (219). Their marriage deteriorates. During this time, Duleep’s father becomes sannyasi (221-223).\n\n1914: In the riots of Muzzafirabad, Edwina Crane turns away a threatening crowd at the door of the mission school. Afterwards she asks for transfer, uncomfortable with expectations that she will perform further acts of magic and bravery. Upon leaving she is given the painting, “The Jewel in Her Crown” (Part 1: pp. 18-20, 22, 24). Crane is transferred to Ranpur.\n\n\"The Jewel in Her Crown\" [Title Allusion] is a painting depicting Queen Victoria on a throne, having just accepted the title \"Empress of India,\" attended by Prime Minister Disraeli, with a map of India, as well as other Indian figures, in 1877, twenty years after the \"Sepoy Mutiny\" when rule of India was passed from the British East India Company to the British Crown. \"In this imaginary picture an Indian prince is offering the old queen a fine gem, the jewel of the title is meant to be India\" itself (Brann 182). Missionaries Edwina Crane (and later in v. 3, Towers of Silence, Barbie Batchelor) used this painting to teach English to Indian children.\n\n1917: Shalini Kumar (Duleep’s sister and Hari’s aunt) marries Prakash Gupta Sen at age 15 or 16 (219).\n\n1919: British General Dyer slaughters hundreds of unarmed Indian men, women, and children at Jallianwallah Bagh, Amritsar, in the Punjab (northern India). This massacre provokes a crisis rivaling the “Sepoy Mutiny” of 1857, in British-Indian history. Miss Crane’s references to the “troubles of 1919” (Part 1; p. 49) connect them to the Mayapore situation as handled by Brigadier Reid in 1942-- “almost as bad as in the days of General Dyer in Amritsar in 1919” (61).\n\n1920: Hari Kumar is born (223), and two days later his mother Kamala dies.\n\n1921 - Oct: Duleep Kumar’s mother dies, shortly after his father dies (223-224).\n\n1922: Duleep Kumar leaves India, taking his two-year-old son Hari to England. He told Hari sometime later: “To learn the secret of the Englishness of the English . . . you had to grow up among them. For him, it was too late. But it was not too late for his son” (Part 5; p. 215). Duleep tries to persuade his sister Shalini to go with him, but she refuses because she feels her duty is in India. Yet she loves Hari, “my English Nephew” (220).\n\n1934(?): “Sister\" Ludmila Smith comes to Mayapore and begins her charity work at the Sanctuary.\n\n1935: Edwina Crane is made superintendent of Anglican schools in Mayapore district, with responsibility for the Anglican mission schools in the civil lines, in Chillianwallah bazaar, and in Dibrapur, 75 miles from Mayapore (28, 33)\n\n1936-1938: Duleep Kumar’s luck in investments and enterprises in England “began to go down hill” (224-225). Too Indian, a source of shame, Duleep had kept himself separated from his son Hari in “his son’s best interests” (225), and when Duleep became bankrupt in 1938, he committed suicide unable to “face what he knew those consequences would mean to that boy of his. Back home to India, in other words, with his tail between his legs” (225). This Mr. Lindsay [Colin Lindsay's father] hears from his lawyer. Although initially, the Lindsays urged “Harry” At this juncture, the family of Colin Lindsay refuses to aid his best friend “Harry Coomer” [Hari Kumar] (227).\n\n1938:\n\nRonald Merrick, born of a poor, working-class family in England—an intelligent “grammar school” boy--comes out to India, where opportunities he could never have had at home open up to him. Here, by virtue of white skin, Merrick can claim superiority (to millions of “black” Indians) for the first time in his life, and socialize with upper class whites who would have had nothing to do with him in England. He is an adamant guardian of the British cantonment’s privilege and physical isolation, and the white man’s biological purity and superiority.\n\nHari Kumar—known in England as Harry Coomer, a carefree, attractive Indian athlete who had lived in England since the age of two and been educated Chillingborough, a prestigious British “public school’ [i.e. private school]-- is forced to return to India (and becomes Hari Kumar), after his father Duleep Kumar [who called himself David Coomer in England, p. 202] loses his fortune and commits suicide in England during Easter holidays, 1938 (Part Five: p. 201). Hari is taken in by his Aunt Shalini in Chillianwallah Bagh, Mayapore; he finds “black” Indian life hateful and foreign. His upper class British manners, accent and education will work insidiously against him with whites like Ronald Merrick of socially inferior educations and accents.\n\nRobin White becomes Deputy Commissioner of Mayapore (33).\n\nMayapore (first introduced Part 1: p. 3) A fictionalized Indian city, its layout described in much detail by various narrators in the novel —particularly the details of the British cantonment, the Indian “native” town, Bibighar gardens and MacGregor House. See the opening of Part 4, pp. 161-164 for details of the British cantonment, the maidan, the Gymkhana club.\n\nCantonment - civil and military (Part 1: p. 3) = The white quarters, exclusive, privileged, “safe” sites of physical, cultural, psychological isolation from the “black” natives.British life in India was carried on by most, in carefully segregated, jealously guarded all-white enclaves that sought to duplicate, mirror, as closely as possible,the cultural environment of “home” while in exile.\n\n1939, May: Deputy Commissioner Robin White sticks his neck out and tries to get the Indian Minister for Education, Indian lawyer Srinivasan, and another Indian Desai admitted to the white-only Gymkhana club for a drink (Part 4: pp. 185-189, 191-192) Srinivasan describes Robin White (187-189) and the “All-India Congress” (189-190), and explains to the unnamed Narrator why his friendship with Robin White was cemented that night when White tried to gain his Indian colleagues admittance to the club, how the incident helped him understand what “men like Robin White stood for…against all narrow opposition,” and made him love the club ever after (191-192).\n\n1940: Ronald Merrick becomes District Superintendent of Police in Mayapore (33).\n\n1941 (?): Daphne Manners joins her aunt and only living relative, Mrs. Henry [Ethel] Manners, in Rawalpindi [abbreviated ‘Pindi], India. Henry Manners had been a just and benevolent provincial governor in India some years, and Henry and Ethel became good friends with Sir Nello and Lili Chatterjee during that time. Daphne’s father and her brother David Manners were recently killed in the war (her mother had died of cancer shortly before WWII began). Daphne had driven an ambulance during the London Blitz, but a doctor warned her to quit because of her heart. Daphne, like Hari Kumar, was born in India but moved to England when she was very young. Daphne’s father loved India but left it for her mother’s sake, and Daphne feels a responsibility to love India, where her father had been happy as he had never been in England\n\nLearn More: In her journals, Daphne speaks of her mother, who hated India, and her father, who loved India (Part 7: p. 377).\n\n1942:\n\nFeb.: After living with her aunt for several months in Rawalpindi, Daphne Manners comes to Mayapore to live with her “aunt” Lili Chatterjee in MacGregor House. Here, Ronald Merrick first meets Daphne Manners.\n\nAfter her first weeks in Mayapore, Daphne went through a period of hating everything about India, and felt the need to break \"my vow, never to go to the [white-only Gymkhana] club because Lili [being an Indian, however well born] couldn't go with me\" (Part 7: pp. 370-371). But Daphne’s initial fear and repulsion toward a very foreign-seeming India eventually dissolve, and she develops an attraction that turns to love for India. Somewhat shamefully, she still will occasionally frequent the white-only cantonment “club,” despite her distaste for its self-righteous racial prejudice, because of her need at times to “be with her own kind.”\n\nMar: Hari Kumar, reporting on a cricket match for the Mayapore Gazette, has a chance encounter with his former English school friend Colin Lindsay on the Mayapore maidan--but Colin does not “see” Hari, who has become just another “invisible” Indian. This rejection drives home Hari's conviction that white and black can never meet on equal terms in India. Learn more from Sister Ludmila's narrative (Part 3: pp. 152-153).\n\nThat night Hari gets drunk and passes out in the waste land. Sister Ludmila finds him and takes him back to the Sanctuary. The next day, Sister Ludmila witnesses the first meeting of the cultured, well-educated “black Englishman” Hari Kumar and District Commissioner of Police Ronald Merrick, who arrests Kumar and takes him in for questioning. Hari is released shortly thereafter through the efforts of the lawyer of his uncle, a rich Indian bania (merchant).\n\n[The unnamed Narrator learns more about the history of Hari Kumar and his Indian relatives from an interview with Mr. Srinivasan, the family lawyer in 1942, whom Hari’s rich bania (merchant) uncle Romesh Chand sent for when Ronald Merrick arrested first arrested Hari at the Sanctuary (Part 4: pp. 174-177).\n\nLearn more: Sister Ludmila's narrative of the day of Hari’s arrest (Part 3: pp. 146-148), in which she reveals her interpretation of the relationship between Hari Kumar and Ronald Merrick, begun the day of Hari's arrest: Merrick “had long ago chosen Hari Kumar, chosen him as a victim, having stood and watched him washing at the pump, and afterwards taken him away for questioning, to observe more closely the darkness that attracted darkness in himself. A different darkness, but still a darkness. On Kumar’s part a darkness of the soul. On Merrick’s a darkness of the mind and heart and flesh. And again, but in an unnatural context, the attraction of white to black, the attraction of an opposite, of someone this time who had perhaps never even leapt into the depths of his own private compulsion, let alone into those of life or of the world at large, but had stood high and dry on the sterile banks, thicketed around with his own secrecy and also with the prejudice he had learned because he was one of the white men in control of a black man’s country” (Part 3: p. 150). In “the imagination” of the unnamed Narrator, Colin Lindsay’s dated entry is connected to “his old friend Harry Coomer [Hari Kumar] who round about this time was found drunk by Sister Ludmila in the waste ground where the city’s untouchables lived in poverty and squalor” (Part 4: p. 182). The unnamed Narrator imagines how Hari Kumar might have felt: from this and other such British enclaves like the maidan “there issues a darkness of the soul, a certain heaviness that enters the heart and brings to life a sadness such as might grow in, and weigh down (year by year until the burden becomes at once intolerable and dear) the body of someone who has become accustomed to but has never quite accepted the purpose or conditions of his exile . . .” (182).\n\nMar: Daphne Manners meets Hari Kumar at a cocktail party given by Lili Chatterjee at the MacGregor House. Daphne discusses her first impressions of Hari at Lili's cocktail party: \"horribly prickly,\" \"except for the colour of his skin he wasn't an Indian at all,\" \"a terribly sad man\" (Part 7: pp. 367-370).\n\nSister Ludmila observes the irony that white women were attracted to Hari Kumar—though he called himself “invisible to white people,” he had “not noticed the way the white women eyed him,” but only the way “they pushed past him, or turned their backs…” (Part 3: p. 152).Sister Ludmila intuits that Hari Kumar still had “a terrible longing to . . . become again part of them [the British in India], because of their Englishness, because England was the only world he knew, and he hated the black town on this side of the river as much as any white man fresh out of England would hate it. Hated it more, because for him the black town was the place where he had to live . . .” (152).\n\nLate Apr. War Week Exhibition on the maidan in the British cantonment, Mayapore. Ronald Merrick sees Daphne Manners talking to Hari Kumar and inviting him back to MacGregor House; this is Daphne’s second meeting with Hari. Sister Ludmila believes that \"It was Kumar that Merrick wanted. Not Miss Manners. And it was probably her association with Kumar that first caused Merrick to look in her direction. This is the way I see it” (Part 3: p. 155).\n\nDaphne Manners recalls the Saturday she went to the War Week Exhibition, met Deputy Commissioner Robin White and Brigadier Reed, saw Hari Kumar again on the maidan, and went up and talked to him, and then ran into Ronald Merrick at the club that evening (Part 7: pp. 372-376). In retrospect, Daphne believes Ronald first took an interest in her because he saw her speak to Hari Kumar that day on the maidan during War Week Exhibition, to head her off from “getting mixed up with the ‘wrong’ type of Indian,” but perhaps afterwards found himself unexpectedly attracted to Daphne (Part 7: pp. 391-392).\n\nMeanwhile, Hari is skeptical of Daphne’s gestures of friendship; he has learned to view such white overtures as calculating and hypocritical, or condescending and pitying--and to doubt his own value. Their friendship develops haltingly in the Raj atmosphere of white disapproval and hostility for mixed racial relationships.\n\nMay/\n\nSummer: Gandhi demands that the British “Quit India” and leave her “‘to God, or to anarchy’” (35). Edwina Crane takes down Gandhi's portrait and the Indian ladies stop coming to tea (36).\n\nDaphne invites Hari to dinner at MacGregor House, explaining that she knew he would never just \"drop by\"; they spend a pleasurable evening together (Part 7: pp. 380-384).\n\nThe following Saturday, Daphne is invited by Mrs. Gupta Sen [Hari's Aunt Shalini] to dinner at her home in Chillianwallah Bagh; Hari is late picking her up, the tonga-wallah gives him trouble because of his pidgin Hindi, but gracious Aunt Shalini sets all to rights, and they have a lovely evening (385-389).\n\nDifferent worlds open to Daphne through Hari Kumar, meeting his Aunt Shalini and getting involved with Sister Ludmila’s work at the Sanctuary. After dinner at Aunt Shalini's, \"Mayapore seemed to change for me,\" expanded from the narrow confines of MacGregor house and the British cantonment out \"to the other side of the river\" [the native town] (Part 7: p. 390). Daphne feels her life has \"split...into three parts\": her white life at the hospital and the club, her home life at MacGregor House with Lili, mixing with Indians and English trying to \"work together,\" and her relationship with Hari . . .\" (390).\n\nIn her journal to her aunt, Daphne Manners discusses \"Bibighar\" as \"the one place in Mayapore where we [Daphne and Hari] could be together and be utterly natural with each other,\" and Daphne explains how difficult it was for them to meet anywhere else, even though they did nothing more that sit \"side by side on the edge of the mosaic 'platform' with our feet dangling, like two kids sitting on a wall\" (Part 7: pp. 378-379).\n\nSister Ludmila’s interpretation of the relationship between the white English girl Daphne Manners and Hari Kumar unfolds (Part 3: pp. 142 & following). Daphne’s initial “powerful compulsion” mixed with “horror” of mixing white and black, grew into love: “And then she rejected the notion of horror entirely, realizing that it was no good waiting for a bridge to be built, but a question of entering the floor, and meeting there, letting the current take them both. It is as if she said to herself: Well, life is not just a business of standing on dry land and occasionally getting your feet wet. It is merely an illusion that some of stand on one bank and some on the opposite. So long as we stand like that we are not living at all, but dreaming. So jump, jump in, and let the shock wake us up. Even if we drown, at least for a moment or two before we die we shall be awake and alive” (142; & see Part 7)\n\nJune Ronald Merrick and Daphne Manners share an intimate dinner—which Merrick has planned carefully to lead up to his proposal of marriage to her.\n\nDaphne later accuses herself on contributing to a kind of \"conspiracy\" of silence--\"rooted in love as well as fear\"--surrounding her \"association\" with Hari Kumar that Daphne herself contributed to by never telling Lili Chatterjee of Ronald Merrick's marriage proposal (Part 7: pp. 365-367). A \"fundamental law\" seemed to be in operation: \"that although a white man could make love to a black girl, the black man and white girl association was still taboo\" (367).\n\nSummer [World War II is raging]: The British are run out of Burma and Malaysia by the invading Japanese, another of the so-called inferior races of the earth in the British imperial view. British losses of men and pride deflated their claims to white superiority. “What sort of white Imperial power was it that could be chased out of Malaya and up through Burma by an army of yellow men? It was a question the Indians asked openly. The British only asked it in the unaccustomed stillness of their own hearts” (Part III, p. 158). At this crucial moment, Gandhi attempts to mobilize India in a civil disobedience campaign against the British—Indians are enjoined to “Quit India”—through Gandhi’s tactics of non-violent non-cooperation. It is at this point that Edwina Crane takes down Gandhi’s picture.\n\nThe rains finally came that year [1942]: Daphne explains how she came to know Sister Ludmila (Part 7: pp. 394-395). Daphne describes Sister Ludmila’s image of the dancing S[h]iva, and the Biblical text framing it (395)—connecting Hindu and Christian. The smiling “winged” god made Daphne think “you could leap into the dark with him and come to no harm” (396).\n\n“What an extraordinary woman she was,” Daphne says of Sister Ludmila, and they “took to each other” (396).\n\nDaphne reflects on how “I’d “divided my life up into these watertight compartments” and describes everything she did in 1942 as “adventures” because they were done “in defiance of others. I was breaking every rule there was” (397). The people in each compartment of Daphne’s lives were “hedged about” by a different set of rules, so they could never be certain “which rule I was breaking in what way” because “they could only follow me far enough to see that I’d broken it and gone away, and become temporarily invisible” (397). That Daphne could not be pinned down into one of these compartments and live by one set of rules—“To be neither one thing nor the other is probably unforgivable” (397), she sees in retrospect. And she genuinely liked the girls and boys at the club, and Ronald Merrick, she loved Lili Chatterjee and Hari Kumar—even as she could see many of their failings—but she tells Auntie Ethel might sound like Daphne is “a paragon of broad-mindedness, until you remember the horrible mess I made of everything” (398).\n\nAfter Hari takes Daphne to Sanctuary the first, Daphne visits several times by herself: Sister Ludmila views Daphne as having a kind of “wholeness I never had” (Part 3: p. 143). She describes her impressions of Daphne and Daphne’s reaction to the “dancing S[h]iva” (Part 3: p. 143).\n\nJuly: Ronald Merrick starts sending his car for Daphne Manners and warns her against her association with Hari Kumar.\n\nOn a Saturday afternoon, Daphne and Hari pick up her birthday photographs for Auntie Ethel [Lady Manners], and then shelter from the rain in the Bibighar. Daphne leaves feeling as if she and Hari had had a “lover’s quarrel. But we weren’t lovers and there’d been no quarrel” (Part 7: pp. 399-400).\n\nDaphne writes a note to Hari asking if he could take her to visit the Tirupati Temple, and a day or two later, Hari responds, a bit coolly, that he will try to arrange it for the following Saturday (Part 7: pp. 400-401).\n\nThe following Saturday, Daphne has dinner with Ronald Merrick at the club. Afterwards he warns her against her “against this association with Mr. Kumar” (401), Daphne gets angry saying she doesn’t “care what colour people are” (402), and Merrick bursts out with: “That’s the oldest trick in the game, to say colour doesn’t matter. It does matter. It’s basic. It matters like hell” (402). He then adds he “put it badly.But I can’t help it. The whole idea revolts me” (402). Daphne feels sorry for Ronald: his honesty is that of a self-centered child, but also “ignorance and cruelty” (402).\n\nHari confirms the Temple visit by note on Friday evening (Part 7: p. 402).\n\nJuly 18: Daphne and Hari visit the Tirupati Temple. Until this excursion, Hari distrusted Daphne, believing she knew all along that Ronald Merrick was the officer that had arrested him earlier in March. Hari tries to offend her. In Part 7, Daphne recounts how she and Lili Chatterjee first came to hear of Hari Kumar, and then meet him at Lili's cocktail party, but she didn't know the \"full story\" of Hari's arrest by Ronald Merrick until Hari told her later after their visit to the Tirupati Temple (364-365).\n\nDaphne feels angry and foolish when she finally discovers that Ronald and Hari had been “what?—enemies—since that day in the Sanctuary” when Ronald arrested Hari (392). Daphne analyzes examples that made her growing relationship with Hari Kumar so difficult—“these repeated experiences of finding myself emotionally out on a limb” (Part 7: pp. 393-394).\n\nDaphne describes their Saturday visit to the Tirupati Temple: the evening is strained from the outset (402 – 410). It is after the temple visit that Daphne learns it was Ronald Merrick who arrested Hari at the Sanctuary that first time—Hari thought she had known all along and was playing him for a fool (408-410). Daphne realizes that she and Hari might be enemies, or strangers, or lovers—“but never friends because such a friendship was put to the test too often to survive. We were constantly having to ask the question, Is it worth it? Constantly having to examine our motives for wanting to be together” (410).\n\nWeeks go by without Daphne hearing from Hari, and when Daphne next sees Ronald she feels hatred for him (410-411).\n\nJuly [some time after the visit at the Tirupati Temple:] Hari Kumar, drunk on a second occasion, visits Sister Ludmila at the Sanctuary at night and tells her why she had found him drunk on the waste land earlier in March, 1942: he had met Colin Lindsay (152), his best friend in England, on the maidan that day, but Colin had passed Hari by without seeming to recognize him: Hari, an “Englishman with black skin who in Mayapore became what he called invisible to white people” (152)—though not invisible to white women, or Daphne Manners, or to Ronald Merrick (153).\n\nDaphne can’t take Hari’s waiting: “In the end I couldn’t bear the silence, the inaction, the separation, the artificiality of my position.I wrote to him [Hari]. I had no talent for self-denial. It is an Anglo-Saxon failing, I suppose” (412). She asks Hari to meet her on Saturday evening at the Sanctuary” (Part 7: p. 413).\n\nAug. 8: All-India Congress votes in favor of Gandhi’s “Quit India” resolution. The British government arrests Congress members. Country-wide riots and arrests will ensue. Not heeding warnings of unrest, Edwina Crane drives to Dibrapur for her weekly inspection of the mission school, and stays the night.\n\nAug. 9: Edwina Crane insists on driving back to Mayapore, and the Dibrapur mission school teacher Mr. Chaudhuri accompanies her because he fears serious trouble. They are attacked on the road from Dibrapur, and Mr. Chaudhuri is killed. Holding the dead teacher’s hand, Miss Crane begs forgiveness for herself and her country, but none is forthcoming: “There was nothing I could do.” Her illusions and hopes for India are dead.\n\nAug 9: That day, August 9, 1942, after Gandhi and his Congress colleagues were locked up, the British began to get scared because of the riots breaking out (Part 7: p. 413). Edwina Crane is taken to the Mayapore General Hospital, and Daphne Manners, on duty at hospital that day, attends Miss Crane (143).\n\nAfter work, Daphne bicycles to the Sanctuary, hoping to see Hari Kumar. He is not there. She talks with Sister Ludmila for a while (Part 7: p. 414). Then Daphne leaves on her bicycle at dusk, and Sister Ludmila \"felt that she was going beyond my help,” just as Sister Ludmila had felt about Hari Kumar when Ronald Merrick had taken him away that day in March 1942, months before (144).\n\nDaphne crosses the Bibighar bridge on her way home (Part 7: p. 415), then stops in at the Bibighar because “I’d had a strong impression of Hari in the Bibighar, sitting in the pavilion alone, not expecting me, but thinking of me, wondering whether I would turn up” (416).\n\nEarly that same evening, Ronald Merrick checks first at the British Gymkhana Club looking for Daphne Manners, then with Lili Chatterjee at MacGregor House to see if Daphne has arrived home from work safely, but she has not yet come home.\n\nDaphne finds Hari at the Bibighar. When Daphne takes hold of Hari’s hand to light a cigarette, Hari asks her what she is trying to prove—“That you don’t mind our touching?” Daphne says, “I thought we’d got beyond that,” but Hari retorts no, “we can never get beyond it.” But Daphne asserts, “But we have. I have. It was never an obstacle anyway. At least not for me” (Part 7: p. 416). Hari then insists she see her home, but Daphne “couldn’t bear it, having him so near, knowing I was about to lose him.” Then somehow they are kissing, touching, and “we were both lost. There was nothing gentle in the way he took me” (417).\n\nThat night in the Bibighar gardens, Daphne Manners makes love with Hari Kumar, and then is raped by unknown Indian ruffians. “They came when we lay half-sleep . . . . Five or six men. Suddenly” (Part7: p. 417). Daphne is raped and Hari is tied up (417-418). In Daphne’s bad dreams, she is blind and it is the image of S[h]iva, leaving “his circle of cosmic fire” to cover and imprison Daphne “in darkness” (417-418). Daphne crawls to ungag and untie Hari, gathering him in her arms because he is crying (418).\n\nAfterwards, they cannot find Daphne's bicycle, Hari carries her down the path, and then Daphne takes charge. She won't let Hari see her home and states: “I’ve got to go home alone. We’ve not been together. I’ve not seen you” (419). She is deaf to Hari’s plea: “I’ve got to be with you. I love you. Please let me be with you” (419). Daphne panics thinking of what “they might to do to him if he said to them, ‘I love her. We love each other’” (419). Daphne beats at Hari, “trying to beat sense and reason and cunning into him. I kept saying, ‘We’ve never seen each other. You’ve been at home. You say nothing. You know nothing. Promise me’” (419). Hari promises. Daphne cannot then turn back, though she feels “I’d done it all wrong” (420).\n\n”I said, ‘There’s nothing I can do, nothing, nothing,’ and wondered where I’d heard those words before” (420) [they are Edwina Crane’s words: see Part One].\n\nDaphne begins running, the girl running in the darkness . . . (420).Their lies about the night in the Bibighar—even less, probably, the truth, had it been told—cannot save Hari from the cruel and unjust aftermath awaiting him. Daphne’s later repeated refusals to identify her rapists are intended to protect Hari and keep the truth of their love hidden, but will give Merrick and others the license to punish him.\n\nDaphne tells her story of these events and their aftermath in her journal to Lady Ethel Manners, Part 7.\n\nMeanwhile that night, Ronald Merrick continues his search for Daphne Manners at the Sanctuary. Sister Ludmila responds to his questions by suggesting that \" Perhaps she [Daphne] has called in a Mrs. Gupta Sen’s [Hari’s Aunt Shalini whom he lives in Chillianwallah Bagh]” (Part 3: p. 155). In retrospect Sister Ludmila believes that her responses to Merrick’s questions were a “betrayal of the boy” [Hari Kumar] and contributed to setting “a tragic course of action” in motion (Part 3: p. 149). Sister Ludmila later regrets mentioning Hari's Aunt because, however unintentionally, she put Hari Kumar in Merrick’s mind and opened up a way for Merrick to punish Kumar, “whom he had already chosen, chosen as a victim. For Merrick was a man unable to love. Only he was able to punish. In my heart I feel this is true. It was Kumar that Merrick wanted. Not Miss Manners. And it was probably her association with Kumar that first caused Merrick to look in her direction.This is the way I see it\" (Part 3: p. 155).\n\nLater that night, Merrick and his policemen go to the Bibighar gardens, find Daphne's abandoned bicycle - which Merrick will \"plant\" as false evidence against Hari Kumar outside his Aunt Shalini's home in Chillanwallah Bagh; there Merrick will arrest Hari Kumar for the rape of Daphne Manners, as well as other Hindu young men he finds drinking hooch in a hut near the Bibighar bridge. Testimony regarding their interrogation, torture, and abuse at Merrick's hands is offered in Part 6, “THREE: (Appendix to 'Civil and Military') A Deposition by S. V. Vidyasagar” (pp. 343-357).\n\nMid - Late Aug: For days afterwards, rioting continues and the British Raj community initially views Edwina Crane and Daphne Manners as innocent victims and martyrs. But neither woman will deliver up to the Raj the Indian assailants demanded, both are found at fault for being too sympathetic and cultivating personal associations with the “blacks,” and both come to viewed as traitors to the white cause.\n\nLearn more: Sister Ludmila recounts the version of Daphne's rape that was adopted by the British Mayapore community (Part 3: pp. 156-157), in contrast to the version remembered and retold by the Indian community (Part 3: pp. 157-158).\n\nHari Kumar and the other young men that Ronald Merrick arrested for Daphne Manners' alleged rape are imprisoned, interrogated, humiliated and tortured. See Part 4: \"Civil and Military: Three: (Appendix to 'Civil and Military') A Deposition by S. V. Vidyasagar” (pp. 343-357). Because of insufficient evidence--especially because Daphne Manners refuses to try to positively identify them as her assailants, they cannot be publicly tried or convicted of rape; however, the British Raj invokes the martial \"Defence of India\" laws to keep Hari Kumar and the other accused imprisoned indefinitely as political prisoners.\n\nOct. Edwina Crane, dressed in white mourning garments, commits suttee (or sati), enacting her own version of the Hindu ritual of the exemplary wife, who enters a state of grace by throwing herself on the funeral pyre of the dead husband—an ultimate act of renunciation for Hindus. For Edwina Crane, it is a final expression of loss, defeat, and despair—a victim of her own and the British Raj's illusions and failed promises to the Indian people.\n\nAlso Oct [?] Sister Ludmila's last visit with Daphne Manners, after the rape, when Daphne comes to say goodbye: “She was pregnant,\" Sister Ludmila observes and is struck that Daphne has “the calmness of a beautiful woman” (150). Sister Ludmila tells the unnamed Narrator that she believes Daphne had made love with Kumar (if not on the night of the Bibighar affair then some other time), that Daphne believed she carried Hari's child, and that Daphne seems in a state of grace during her pregnancy (Part 3: p. 155).\n\nDaphne does not know where they have taken Hari Kumar, who was “arrested, that night of Bibighar, with some other boys” (150-151). Daphne “will go through” with the pregnancy, refuses to abort her baby though for the European community, especially other white women “To get rid. . . . To tear the disgusting embryo out of the womb and throw it to the pi-dogs,” as Sister Ludmila heard a white woman say, seems an “obligation” (151). To such people, Daphne had become “’that Manners girl’” (151).\n\nTo Daphne during this last visit, Sister Ludmila confesses that her response to Ronald Merrick the night of the rape has “been on my conscience” (Part 3: p. 153) and she tries to “unburden” (p. 154), but Daphne cannot help Sister Ludmila “unburden” herself “Of blame, of guilt, of treacherously saying to Merrick: Perhaps she has called in a Mrs. Gupta Sen’s [Hari’s Aunt Shalini which whom he lives in Chillianwallah Bagh]” (155).\n\n1943, May:Parvati Manners is born and Daphne dies in childbirth. Though sensing this will be her fate, Daphne had refused an abortion, defying white prejudice and remaining faithful to her forbidden love.\n\nAfter Daphne's death, Lady Manners reads Daphne's journal addressed to her aunt posthumously (see Part 7). In the journals, Daphne asks her aunt to provide for her child even if \"you can't bear to have it near you\" and gives directions about what to name the child (Part 7: pp. 376-377). Daphne recounts key events in her life in Mayapore, 1942; then speaks of the “awful weight on my mind about Ronald” [Merrick], like a “dark shadow, just on the edge of my life” (391). She suspects “things about Ronald that no one is prepared to discuss in front of me,” that he has “hurt Hari [Kumar] in some special horrible way” (391). She refers to her talk with Sister Ludmila [see Part Three], that “Ronald Merrick was on Sister Ludmila’s conscience too” (391). ”Before I tell you what actually happened in the Bibighar, I must say something about Ronald, and . . . about Sister Ludmila” (391 & see what follows).\n\n1944, May: [Later in the Raj Quartet] Nigel Rowan interviews Hari Kumar in Kandipat Prison, where he has been locked up since 1942.\n\n1947, Aug. [Later in the Raj Quartet] Guy Perron [who may be the unnamed Narrator] returns to India; the British officially withdraw from India, the country is partitioned into two nations: predominantly Hindu India and predominantly Muslim Pakistan, amid monumental human migrations and slaughter.\n\n1964 & Notes on Narrative Method\n\nAn inquisitive “stranger” or “traveller” comes to Mayapore, India, with an interest in the [Daphne] Manners case of 1942—at a crisis in the history of British-Indian racially-charged relations, recalling the Sepoy Mutiny and the Amritar massacre of 1919. Author Paul Scott has stated that he is “Nearly,” but “not quite” this stranger-narrator. “Basically, this writer/traveller/stranger is a mechanism for achieving both detachment and involvement” (quoted in Moore 171). The unnamed Narrator's interest in Mayapore of 1942, has been aroused by his coming upon the unpublished memoir of Brigadier Reid [reproduced in Part 6: \"Civil and Military: One: Military,\" pp. 273-319). In Mayapore, the stranger collects oral and written testimony, interviewing people-- witnesses who are still alive--about events and people of the past, in order to examine and understand the final phases of British / Indian history.\n\nInterviews with Lili Chatterjee: See Part 2.\n\nInterview #1 with \" Sister Ludmila\" [AKA: Mrs. Ludmila Smith] (Part 3: pp. 121-137): Sister Ludmila is now blind and mostly bedridden, allowed a room in what was formerly the Sanctuary (124). She occasionally addresses the unnamed Narrator directly: e.g. “It is not for this you have come” (121). Mrs. Ludmila Smith speaks of the name \"Sister Ludmila\" that the Indians called her, and the nun-style habit she designed and wore in Mayapore, ca. 1942. She has had a close relationship with God, who speaks directly to her (121-125).She discusses her childhood, particularly an incident in Brussels, when her mother’s money is refused by Roman Catholic nuns because it is “tainted” (122). After being ashamed of her mother's money for awhile, “suddenly I saw the truth! How could I have been so blind? How angry He [God] would have been with them [the sisters] for refusing the money my mother had offered!” (123).\n\nInterview #2 with \" Sister Ludmila\" (Part 3: pp. 137-158): her interpretations of the character of Daphne Manners and her relationship with Hari Kumar (142-143, 153); her meeting with Daphne at the Sanctuary earlier on the evening of her rape, just after Daphne had met Edwina Crane at the Mayapore General Hospital (143-144); her recollections of retrieving Hari Kumar from the waste land and his arrest the next day by Superintendent of Police Ronald Merrick, and her interpretation of the relationship between Kumar and Merrick (146-150); her last meeting with pregnant Daphne Manners before she leaves Mayapore (150-151); her insights into Hari Kumar's character (152) gained from the second occasion when she saw Hari drunk--when he talks of Colin Lindsay (152-153); the connection she sees between Edwina Crane and Daphne Manners (155-156); and she recounts the version of Daphne's rape that was adopted by the British Mayapore community (156-157), in contrast to the version remembered and retold by the Indian community (157-158).\n\nInterview with Srinivasan at the Club and on the car tour of Mayapore in a Studebaker afterwards: See Part 4. When the unnamed Narrator asks, “And young Kumar? Where is he now? Srinivasan shrugs. Dead perhaps” (Part 4: p. 197). As the group drives back, they pass the Bibighar in silence, “but the silence is commentary enough. Bibighar. After a time even the most tragic name acquires a kind of beauty” (198). Part IV ends with unnamed Narrator's reflections on the thematic image of “the girl who ran in the darkness” (198).\n\nSee Study Guides 1, 2 and 3 for Notes on Jewel in the Crown, Parts One - Seven.\n\nAt the end of Jewel in the Crown (Part 7, Appendix), the Stranger-narrator flies to Calcutta to review documents held by the Bishop Barnard Mission, including Miss Crane’s effects.\n\nNotes on Scott's NARRATIVE METHOD:\n\nThis unnamed narrator functions as an impartial chronicler/historian, an observer-character. The “Interview Style,” reporting in detail conversations with informed witnesses, enables Scott to present numerous versions and perspectives of, for example, the Bibighar incident: ultimately we hear first-hand accounts from almost all the characters involved (even Daphne Manners through her letters), except Hari Kumar, who is lost, and Ronald Merrick, who is dead. . Piecing these accounts together, ideally an historian (and his reader) can reconstruct a truth (the truth?).\n\n“The method of the narrator of the [Raj] Quartet is that of historical inquiry . . . . The concern is with what happened to those involved in the Manners case, its ripple effect on their subsequent lives, and its utility as a mirror of the long British-Indian affair” (Morgan 172). Paul Scott states that the characters and events of the Raj Quartet were imaginary, but that “[t]he framework was as historically accurate as I could make it” (quoted in Morgan 173).\n\nPanoramic historical events and historical forces are humanized, particularized, telescoped, enacted in resurrecting individual (fictionalized but historically plausible) places, events, and characters—especially characters’ internal moral dramas and fateful choices. The disembodied narrative voice of Jewel in the Crown also speaks from inside the (imagined) viewpoints of characters long dead—consider the opening voice of Part I revealing Edwina Crane in indirect third-person point of view. The narrative voice, however, much it can recede into the background, mediates and colors our access to the story--and is therefore positioned to interpret it, even if such interpretation is subtle.\n\nThe story is not told in chronological order. In the process of confusing and disrupting linear time, returning again and again to the same key events from multiple perspectives, Scott presents a cyclical theory of human history that keeps folding and tracing outcomes back to their beginnings, and revealing the larger patterns of parallel and repetition dramatized more intimately in individual human lives and particular events. The narrative structure, based largely on participant-witnesses’ reminiscences about the past, unfolds the subject as if it were taking place in the present. At times the narrator and/or his informants disclose outcomes (e.g. Edwina Crane’s suicide) before we readers have learned how they came about.\n\nBut this achronological narrative of interviewees’ testimonies should not be condemned as purposeless or without structure. For one thing, the “Interview Style,” paralleling scholarly methods of reconstructing and writing history, serves to authenticate the stories.\n\nIn Part II, interviewee Lili Chatterjee presents apparently random thoughts and digressions, the focus of her talk shifting with associations, moving in and out, toward and away from Edwina Crane and her niece Daphne Manners. This narrative method, however, reveals that, in Lili’s mind, the lives and fates of Edwina and Daphne are inseparable, intertwined—and thus in the reader’s consciousness, too, should be thematically connected. [Lady Lili Chatterjee, widow of Sir Nello Chatterjee, lives in MacGregor House and is a leader of Indian society in Mayapore in 1942 (Part 1: p. 33).]\n\nIn Part III, interviewee Sister Ludmila begins with apparently unrelated descriptions of her weekly trips to the bank, but soon enough broaches the scene of Daphne Manners waiting for Hari Kumar to meet her in the Sanctuary the night of August 9, 1942. Amid her deceptively “free” associations and digressions, Sr. Ludmila returns again and again the same key points in the past— her “free” associations thematically and causally connect the fateful night of August 9 to the earlier events stemming from finding Hari Kumar drunk in the wasteland. By Part V when yet another account of Sister Ludmila finding Hari drunk in the waste ground is presented, readers’ appreciation of its significance has deepened fivefold, one might say.\n\n[\"Sister Ludmila\" Smith (roughly patterned after Mother Teresa) ran the Sanctuary, in Mayapore's native town, ministering to the sick with kindness and compassion, and providing Indians some measure of dignity in death. Few members of the white community in Mayapore sympathized with her work. It was Indians who called her \"Sister Ludmila.\"]\n\n1984/5: FILM ADAPTATION\n\nThe 16-hour Granada television adaptation Jewel in the Crown tells the interlocked stories of the Raj Quartet in chronological order and achieves a fascinating dramatization by focusing on key “characters, the tensions between them and their developing situations. The historical context is brilliantly conveyed by newsreel clips so patently pro-British that they serve as a parodic commentary . . .” (Morgan 211). But it is well to emphasize what is “largely lost in the process of adaptation”: “the texture of testimony, its intimation of character, the doubts about the truth and reality of observations” (Morgan 211)--all central to the experience of reading first-hand Paul Scott’s Raj novels.\n\nOf related interest: Brant, George W., ed.
