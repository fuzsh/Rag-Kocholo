        "text": "Daphne Warburg Astor may have borne the names of two of the wealthiest families in American history, but she wore the pedigree lightly. Her disarmingly unconventional style was wedded to an expression of wryly amused detachment, perhaps derived in part from the fact she was an American by birth domiciled in rural England.\n\nShe had moved across permanently in 1979, at the time of her second marriage, to Micky Astor â€” a scion of the English branch of the Astor family, and grandson of the Virginian-born society hostess Nancy Astor, who became the first female MP to take her seat in parliament. Daphne and Micky adopted three children and settled at Hatley Park, in Cambridgeshire, a Georgian mansion with 1,800 acres of land.\n\nIf asked,"
