        "text": "Obituary For Daphne Smothers Canty\n\nMrs. Daphne Smothers Canty passed away on Monday, February 26, 2024.\n\nDaphne Smothers Canty was born on October 7, 1943 and raised by her late mother, Maelyn Golden and father figure, Goldie Golden in Washington D.C. Her life's Earthly transition was made on February 26, 2024. She was preceded in death by her late husband Isaiah “Ike” Cantey and her son Warren Christopher Whitaker.\n\nShe spent the bulk of her life in Washington, D.C., El Paso, Texas, and Greensboro, North Carolina. While she had been a member of several churches, at the time of her death, she belonged to the Tabernacle International Church with Pastor Alvin Jones. She loved getting dressed and attending church to hear the Lord's Word. She spent the past four years in Atlanta, Georgia, where she moved for health reasons. Daphne worked a number of jobs in the medical and customer service fields throughout her life. The last job she held was in Greensboro at Market America.\n\nShe loved all types of music, dancing, and football (Dallas Cowboys). She loved fashion from head to toe. Daphne was not shy in any way and loved to perform. Whether singing in a choir or lip syncing her favorite Diana Ross song in a competition, she loved having fun and hanging around her friends and family. Daphne also had a great sense of humor and could laugh with the best of them. She often mentioned how much her late husband Isaiah made her laugh. She missed him so much.\n\nDaphne loved us all and felt loved to the end. The night before her transition was spent dancing with one of our childhood friends and enjoying life with a smile. We were blessed to have experienced her smile, soul, and wonderful laughter.\n\nDaphne is survived by her sons: Tim and Aaron Whitaker; her grandchildren: Shamayia, Zianni, Aspen, Jaylen and Jackson; and her four great-grandchildren: Omari, Messiah, Maleah, and Kyrie. She will be missed and loved by the many friends and others she came in contact with around the country.\n\nA Funeral Service to honor her will be held on Saturday, March 9, 2024 in the Cassie Coote-Brown Memorial Chapel at 3pm; Perry J. Brown Funeral Home 909 E. Market St. Greensboro, 27401. Visitation at 2:30pm.\n\nBurial will be on Monday, March 11, 2024 at 10am in Lakeview Memorial Park 3600 North O' Henry Blvd. Greensboro, NC 27405\n\nSend flowers to the service of Daphne Smothers Canty"
