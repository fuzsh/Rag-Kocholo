All reflect the Cluster Learning Model, which emphasizes interdisciplinary teaching and learning, and of the University’s commitment to educating students about environmental sustainability, caring for the environment, and promoting sustainable practices to the campus community and the world.\n\n“When we think about living more sustainably we often think about technology and engineering, but to promote change we need to understand the problem, reveal its impacts, and inspire society,” says Professor Brian Eisenhauer, director of PSU’s Office of Environmental Sustainability. “We don’t save what we don’t know or care about. Many professional roles in sustainability require diverse skills including those from the social sciences, communications, business, and the humanities, and we are excited to help our students create a better future through their work. This generous funding from NEH enables us to create ways to do that.”\n\nMessage from the President\n\nMessage from the President\n\n“We hold our futures in our hands”\n\nPlymouth State, now in its 153rd year as an institution and our twentieth as a university, is meeting the challenges of higher education’s changing landscape. What unites our efforts is a deep belief in our students’ potential and a drive to innovate. We’re creating new opportunities to take advantage of rapid advances in technology, an evolving marketplace, and the needs of the communities and state we serve.\n\nPSU is alive with energy and accomplishments.\n\nA year ago we inaugurated the new Morgridge Strength and Performance Lab, a state-of-the-art facility that’s more than ten times larger than the one it replaced. It surpasses what you’ll find at many Division I schools and is the final piece completing the Human Performance Center. Not only do student athletes make full use of the facility, but it is also a teaching Open Lab for a wide range of health and science academic programs available through PSU’s innovative Cluster Learning model, such as exercise and sport physiology and human performance, athletic training, and advanced graduate programs for physical therapists. There is really nothing like it.\n\nAnniversaries Mark Our Progress\n\nHappy anniversary4!\n\nIt’s been one anniversary after another this year, with each representing substantial accomplishment, tremendous pride, and undeniable progress.\n\nOur acclaimed meteorology program\n\nOf Plymouth State College’s transition to Plymouth State University\n\nOf the Eagle Pond Authors’ Series\n\nOf the founding of the University’s Museum of the White Mountains\n\nPSU Orientation: Nurturing Belonging and Transformative Learning\n\nPSU Orientation: Nurturing Belonging and Transformative Learning\n\nPlymouth State University (PSU) provides students with powerful opportunities to explore their passions and engage in transformative learning experiences, ultimately paving the way for careers of purpose. A cornerstone of this commitment lies in the comprehensive orientation experiences that connect students within their community. These initiatives, choreographed through the Student Experience Office, which is a part of Student Life, begin from the moment new Panthers step foot on campus.\n\nOrientation programming is intentionally crafted to guide students toward a sense of belonging and connection as they embark on their college journey. It begins with an online module that acquaints students with the PSU community’s shared values, setting the stage for in-person experiences in June. Hundreds of new students participate in their first overnight stay on campus, forging bonds with fellow students and establishing connections with dedicated faculty and staff. This immersive experience creates a foundation upon which students can build lasting relationships.\n\nReturning students serve as orientation leaders, who help usher new Panthers through their transition to campus. Jonah Rosenberg ’24, a political science major, explains, “My first experience at PSU was at Orientation and I learned probably the best piece of advice; growth doesn’t happen in your comfort zone. From being in Orientation, to being an orientation leader, I constantly pushed myself into my growth zone and it has been one of the best things I have ever done! I used to be afraid of things outside my comfort zone, now I know they are opportunities for growth.”\n\nIn the Eye\n\nof the Storm\n\nWhen you’re in the news you never want to be the news.\n\nAs broadcasters we try to fly under the radar as much as possible. Prior to this summer, I spent the last 18 years living out my lifelong dream as a broadcast meteorologist. My stops included Rochester, New York; Albany, New York (twice); Saginaw Michigan; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Boston, Massachusetts and Des Moines, Iowa. If you are familiar with the news industry, it might seem counterintuitive to move from a city like Boston to Des Moines. Typically, a newscaster climbs the ladder over his or her career moving up in market size and pay. I had the opportunity to become chief meteorologist and with that a responsibility of raising public awareness by connecting the dots between extreme weather and climate change in a part of the country where scientific awareness is suspect.\n\nDuring my time in Boston, I had the opportunity to cover some of the biggest, strongest, and most destructive hurricanes to make landfall in the United States between 2016 and 2021. These storms rapidly intensified before making landfall at an almost unprecedented rate, and once the storms made landfall, they dropped historic amounts of rain. For every degree Celsius the atmosphere warms, it holds seven percent more moisture. That manifests in the form of heavy, flooding rains, which happen on a more frequent basis. After witnessing these catastrophic impacts of climate change, I saw the urgency for covering the crisis regularly during the evening newscasts. Station management in Boston were supportive of the idea, and we launched the country’s first weekly series on climate change.\n\nThe Art of Balancing\n\nMy journey at Plymouth State University began with uncertainty, but it has transformed me in countless ways.\n\nThe people and experiences I’ve encountered have shaped me into the person I am today.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I was involved in track and videography on the side. The gym was also a big part of my life, which I used on campus five times a week. Things started to change for the better as I progressed. I now run my own freelance videography company, Sylvain Productions, and joined the Plymouth State Communications and Marketing Office to create videos for their brand my junior year. I have also pulled away from track to focus more on body building. Not only that, I also run my own fitness page, where I create my own videos and other media to help those in need of fitness advice.\n\nMy major in psychology has not changed but I have shifted my focus from therapy to marketing. I like the media side and am minoring in communications and media studies.\n\nPSU Leads the Way in Eclipse Field Work\n\nPlymouth State University is among 70 colleges and universities across the country working on NASA’s Nationwide Eclipse Ballooning Project.\n\nThis largest eclipse field campaign of its kind has over 1,000 participants studying atmospheric effects during solar eclipses, and PSU’s distinctive approach is in keeping with the interdisciplinarity that is at the heart of the Cluster Learning Model.\n\nOf all the participating schools, Plymouth State is the only university to have two NASA-funded atmospheric science teams. Seventeen students and three faculty from diverse academic backgrounds are working together to bridge art and science. “All teams are making contributions scientifically, but the natural beauty of solar eclipses provides a tremendous opportunity to look at this event through an artistic perspective. I think we’re leading the way with developing artistic elements,” says Meteorology Professor Eric Kelsey, who leads one of PSU’s two teams.\n\nQ&A: AI and Its Implications\n\nProfessor Harsha Abeykoon earned his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and his master’s degree in mobile robotics from Keio University, Japan.\n\nHe subsequently obtained his PhD from Keio University, specializing in surgical robotics. Prior to joining Plymouth State University, he held the position of senior lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa.\n\nPlymouth Magazine recently caught up with him to discuss the AI and its implications.\n\n“A Moment in Time”\n\n“A Moment in Time”\n\nThe Story Behind the Phi Mu Kappa / Tau Kappa Epsilon Legacy Bench\n\nGreek life at Plymouth State began with the founding of Phi Mu Kappa in 1963. While the community may have been hatched with the pursuit for social independence in mind, it became a gathering place and sounding board for so much more and helped students navigate a rapidly changing social landscape.\n\nA granite bench honors the legacy of The Phi Mu Kappa/Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and has raised funds toward the R. Stephen Eastman Scholarship. Located on University Way, facing the Samuel Read Hall Building (formally Hall dormitory), it is engraved with the fraternity crests and dates of existence as well as the lyric, “He ain’t heavy he’s my brother,” a song emphasizing PMK/TKE’s bonds of brotherhood.\n\nWith the purchase of the first and only off-campus fraternity house in 1968, Phi Mu Kappa joined a national fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and became known as The Lambda Rho Chapter of TKE. During its nearly 25 years of existence, over 250 members bore witness to a very special moment in time.\n\nTHE GREEN | PLYMOUTH STATE ALUMNI NEWS & NOTES | WINTER 2024\n\nJump to Decade\n\n1950s\n\nBernice (Burlock) Doane ’58 was involved in basketball, tennis, and golf while at college.
