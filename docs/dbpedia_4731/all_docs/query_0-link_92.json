        "text": "School & Program\n\nUniversity of Plymouth, Direct Entry Medicine\n\nMeadowridge Student Since\n\nGrade 1\n\nBorn in\n\nVancouver, Canada\n\nTell us a bit about yourself.\n\nWell before Grade 11 and 12 I filled my time with lots of extra-curriculars. I trained three or four times per week for fencing. I trained nationally, competed in the states… fencing is actually something I picked up at the school with Ms. Chow. I remember seeing the demonstration at the assembly and came home and said that I needed to play. I trained for my first two years at Meadowridge, then moved on to city clubs. Besides that, I also play piano, do a lot of volunteering – I volunteer at the hospital and with the Coquitlam Youth Council – and like to play soccer and ski. My family loves to be outdoors, and we go camping every summer and skiing every winter.\n\nHow did you first find yourself at Meadowridge?\n\nWell I started in Grade 1, so coming here was my parents’ decision. They toured the campus and liked the teachers, the uniforms, the feeling. They also like the Vision Statement and Mr. Burke!\n\nTell us about your year ahead.\n\nI’ll be going to the UK to study medicine, in the Direct Entry Medical Program at the University of Plymouth. It was important for me to go away for school, to somewhere I’d never been before. I actually travelled to Europe for the first time for my university interviews, and it was all so different, something to get used to. I’m looking forward to that.\n\nWhat was it like finding out you’d be headed to University of Plymouth next year?\n\nI was actually on the DP couches. It was between blocks and we were all chilling there. I was really shocked when I first saw the email, then I clicked it and yelled really loud. So loud that Mrs. Mohoruk came out and said, “I guess you got in, then?” She had heard me. It was such an accomplishment for me. I texted my mom after that, then told Mr. Graveson.\n\nWhat was it about Plymouth? About Medicine?\n\nI’ve always loved Science, more than any other subject, so that’s what started it. Then, I slowly looked into the body and researched myself. When I volunteered with hospitals, that’s what really solidified my decision to study medicine. I find it all so fascinating, but it is also the patient element; I like helping people. I like the academic rigour and that it requires challenge and demand, but that it also takes responsibility and an obligation to have a lot of knowledge. If I had a choice, I’d work in the ER.\n\nI really love the people here. Everyone – all the students, the teachers, the staff, the custodians, and the Board – is so nice and down to earth. I always felt like I could be myself here. It’s home.\n\nAs for why the UK… well, it has a really good medical program, and I know a lot of students who have been successful there. The United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) is a lot like Canada’s. It’s also commonwealth, so the transfer is easier and the language is the same. Plymouth is also by the sea and, living in Vancouver, I’ve gotten used to that!\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to in the year ahead?\n\nI think meeting new people and living the university life. It’s the freedom I’ve been waiting for, to have flexibility and just live your life. I had a taste of that this summer when I went to a summer camp in Toronto. We got to buy our own groceries, cook our own food, and make all our own decisions. But you learn from that, too: we ordered a shrimp platter that, after, we were too lazy to take down to the trash and it ended up smelling horrible. You learn from experiences like that!\n\nWhat will you miss most as you move onto the next chapter?\n\nI’m going to miss the memories. Like PYP memories – those were the days! I miss that lifestyle. I love learning, and I enjoyed every moment that I had at school. All the clubs and teachers and working my way up the grades. I also have a lot of fond memories of taking the bus, especially bugging the older students. I loved having older students to look up to, always wondering, “When will it be my chance to do the Exhibition? The Personal Project? Graduation?” Things like that.\n\nI’m going to miss the teachers. They are so caring and super knowledgeable. They have a passion for their jobs and they take the time when you need it. When I left for a year in Grade 9, that’s something that I noticed; it’s just not the same at other schools. I really love the people here. Everyone – all the students, the teachers, the staff, the custodians, and the Board – is so nice and down to earth. I always felt like I could be myself here. It’s home.\n\nAny parting words of wisdom?\n\nAppreciate your time at school. Enjoy every moment."
