        "text": "Here is my keynote from the Prince From Minneapolis conference, delivered on April 16, 2018 in Minneapolis at the University of Minnesota not longer after a major winter storm. It’s an edited, excerpted version of a longer jam that will be published somewhere sometime soon in some format. Huge shout out to Daphne Brooks, Arun Saldanha, Zenzele Isoke, and Megan Mehl.\n\nSometimes it snows in April, indeed. It’s been hard to get here but it’s an honor to be here in the Twin Cities, talking about a Gemini no less, because for me — as I’m sure it has been for so many of us who were not lucky enough to be born and/or raised here — Minneapolis and St. Paul played a huge role in helping me find a path towards my own freedom as a boy growing up far away from here in Honolulu, Hawai’i.\n\nI couldn’t have placed Minneapolis on a map back then, but it loomed large in my mind: the sound and vision of a freaky desegregated, polycultural, genderfluid utopian bohemia of “Uptown”, where all had freed themselves from society’s constraints. This sonic imaginary of the Twin Cities belonged to Prince.\n\nToday and in the coming days, we and all of Minneapolis will be celebrating the work and impact of Prince. We will do that in all our radical diversity of ways.\n\nI myself am drawn to the image of Prince bounding across the stage of post-civil rights America — an era that we might say opened 50 years ago with the gunshots that killed Martin Luther King, Jr., whose echoes still ring. In history’s missile arc of regress, Prince was a break — stopping and dropping into the splits, exhorting us to go crazy with a shake of the wrist and a mascaraed side-eye, approving of the mirth and mischief he’d done like some sort of Purple Moses in high-heeled boots, leading us through the confusion and ruins of the dream of a post-segregated America with beautiful music and odd digressions on sex, God, Spooky Electric, symbols, names, we-can-funk-until-the-dawns and why-can’t-we-live-togethers.\n\nIn his book I Would Die 4 U, Touré writes about Prince as one of the quintessential heroes of our own lost generation, and I’m inclined to agree. For Touré, Prince is the latchkey loner who leads us to freedom through sex and God. For me, he embodies our time in the wilderness between the high era of Civil Rights and Black Power and our current period shaped by social movements like Black Lives Matter, the DREAMers, the Women’s Marchers, Occupy, and the warriors at Standing Rock and Parkland. It is a time when we have seen massive cultural desegregation at the same time that we have experienced massive physical and social resegregation. It is a time when we find ourselves further from a national consensus to confront and end racial segregation and inequality than we have ever been.\n\nPerhaps our generation will be remembered as one that came of age during a time of constant political reversals, an era of brutal backlash that has required unusual skills of the best of us, all the virtues and vices of which Prince had in abundance — apocalyptic wit, coy evasiveness, expansive conceptualizing, obscure stand-taking, sensational and sensual creativity.\n\nPrince was a master of masks in a time of masking. When he told you that he knew how to undress himself it was a tease, but also a warning. He knew his survival depended upon his control of his body and what he covered it with.\n\nAnd perhaps it is only now — in a moment where social movements are resurgent and converging, when we are all removing the masks we have donned so long in order to face down and scream out our deepest desires against oppressive power — that might we begin to make sense of someone like Prince.\n\nI am motivated to talk about him this way because we find ourselves with wars still all around us. Prince’s lines, “We could all die any day” or “Police ain’t got no gun/You don’t have to run”, take on a terrifying specificity for African Americans, in the context of Philando Castile, Jamar Clark, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Stephon Clark. This is a moment in which our President is also the Troll-In-Chief, the un-Prince, a Gemini who shows no humor, no dexterity, no empathy, no intellect, no dance, no music — sex, yes—but no romance.\n\nThis is also a historical moment in which, fifty years since King’s assassination, we find ourselves further from a national consensus to confront and end racial segregation and resegregation than we have ever been. Prince’s journey went in the opposite direction. He did what real leaders do, he subverted the accepted wisdom and what passed for common sense to move us forward.\n\nAs a precocious, ambitious teenager, Prince did not begin his musical career thinking of himself as someone who wanted to say much, if anything, about race. And yet, against the backdrop of the Reagan-era backlash against civil rights and Black empowerment, he came to vocalize the fight against cultural and material segregation. Now that he has gone, it is possible to say that one of Prince’s most powerful legacies is how he expanded what Claudia Rankine has called “the racial imaginary,” how he enabled future generations to take their place in bending the moral arc towards justice.\n\nI wanted to begin with a story from the fall of 2016. It was about 10 months after Jamar Clark had been shot by police, Black Lives Matter demonstrators launched an encampment at the local police precinct, and a group of white supremacists tried to empty their guns on them. It was just two months after Philando Castile was mercilessly murdered in Falcon Heights in St. Paul by a policeman, and Diamond Reynolds’ video of the shocking act circulated around the world.\n\nI was given the opportunity to be on Kerri Miller’s show on Minnesota Public Radio to discuss white flight in America. The call-in show quickly became a forum on the resegregation of the Twin Cities, and it was here that I was educated on the yawning gap between the Minneapolis of Prince’s Uptown imaginary, a place in which Prince, the Time, Husker Du, and the Replacements could all be digging each other, and the world digging their digging each other, and the actual Minneapolis, a resegregated nightmare not so different from the St. Louis or Baltimore of Prince’s later singing, where there would be no justice and no peace.\n\nThat day we were lucky enough to have the University of Minnesota’s own Myron Orfield, the nation’s expert on segregation, call in. He spoke directly to this gap, placing Minneapolis’s fraught racial history into context. “We had some of the strongest racial integration policies in the country for twenty years, and we abandoned them,” he said. “I think we’ve really paid the price.”\n\nWhat is that price? Minneapolis has the lowest rate of Black home ownership in the country[1]. Its schools have resegregated at a horrifying pace: the number of schools in which students of color are more than 90% of the student body has doubled since 2002.[2] Racial achievement gaps in Minneapolis schools are among the highest in the country.[3] It could be argued that Minneapolis has fallen further and faster into resegregation than many other cities in the North.\n\nThe Twin Cities were once considered a national leader in desegregation. Orfield wrote, “Minneapolis was the first large city in the country to enact a fair housing ordinance, and Minnesota was one of the first states to pass a civil rights law outlawing housing discrimination.”[4] As a result of a desegregation order in the 1970s, he added, the Twin Cities became “one of the most integrated metropolitan areas in the United States.”[5]\n\nI emailed Myron after the show: “It seems like the era in which the Twin Cities were at the forefront of desegregation policies may have been the era that produced not just a young Paul Westerberg and Tommy Stinson but a 17 year-old athlete and musical prodigy named Prince Rogers Nelson. Is it about right to say that?”\n\nMyron replied quickly, “You’re right. I had the privilege to go to Junior High School with Prince.” Perhaps a brilliant Twin Cities resident will write the story about if and how desegregation helped foster the city’s stunning musical and cultural breakthroughs in the 1980s, and also what desegregation failed to do. A good blueprint would be Andrea Swensson’s essential Got To Be Something Here, a prehistory of Prince and those who made the Minneapolis Sound.\n\nThat story takes us through Bryant Junior High, where Prince met fellow aspiring musicians like Jimmy Jam, and took music theory and business of music classes that would set him on his journey. Prince would then go on to Ramsey Junior High, further south. And there is a deep beauty to the fact that another boy, who would go on to become the nation’s leading expert on racial segregation, shared that same space. Our desire for that kind of beauty, that kind of symmetry, which itself is a kind of justice, has been abandoned. And yet this justice, this beauty shaped how Prince pursued his music his entire life.\n\nBy themselves, desegregated spaces do not end racism or inequity, nor are they without their struggles. But an expansive imaginary can rise from the heat of radically different bodies in contact with each other. At their best these spaces allow an organic understanding of possibilities outside of a repressive and racialized status quo. They may do this because they violate the first rule of power, which is to name, separate, divide, and rank. Instead of disengagement, people might work through unequal relations toward ways to commit to each other, to live together. They might co-create a common language, a common culture. Whether he realized it or not in the beginning, leading this process was Prince’s calling.\n\nMusic is the most social of all art forms. The party is a place of public joy and leveling. It is literally where we come together, a line that Prince — as much as he said he hated the Beatles — understood in all its meanings. The Prince of the early 1980s makes manifestos of his “screw the masses” sexual anthems: “Partyup”, “Uptown”, “Sexuality”, “D.M.S.R.” When we move in space and time, aware of our bodies and others moving together, we are learning to labor toward new forms of unity, new kinds of consciousness. We are showing ourselves and each other how to work. In “I Would Die 4 U”, this consciousness promises to take us beyond gender into “something you can’t understand,” and even bring together good and evil.\n\nIn “Sexuality” he sang about tearing down the status quo, then chanted about the production and reproduction of “a new breed of leaders” who would “stand up, organize.” He offered no agenda or particular kind of solidarity. Unlike the Clash’s Sandinista, he proposed a kind of anti-politics. But in another sense Prince was also offering a radical and prescient challenge to whiteness that, almost a decade later, Cornel West would name “The New Cultural Politics of Difference.”\n\nPrince meant to blow up the binary logics of exclusion — “Am I white or Black, am I straight or gay?” — to challenge the way whiteness separates and classifies, erases ways of knowing and ways of being, contains and essentializes all other identities, and otherwise does violence upon them. He is very aware what this process of Othering can do: “Some people wanna die so they can be free.” In the next decade, even his much-maligned love symbol was a radical statement, a conflation of gender symbols that suggests myriad possibilities beyond the essentialized notions of male and female.\n\nCultural conservatives, whose lot included a sizable number of political liberals, saw stuff like this as socially designed fuckery that hastened the apocalypse, but Prince positioned sex, celebration, and love as god (gendered pronoun suspended), a procreative response to the apocalypse. As he sang 15 years later on Emancipation’s “The Love We Make,” made older, wiser, and saddened by Jonathan Melvoin’s death: “The only love there is, is the love we make.”\n\nThe music of “Controversy”, what Rickey Vincent has called “naked funk,” is deceptively simple. It opens as a simple four-on-the-floor with a one-note bassline, the vocal lines following the keyboard melodies, as if to imitate and mock the reductivism of the monoculture. But by the chorus, as Prince has sketched in the beat with irresistible contrapuntal elements, it becomes clear he is teasing Dominant Culture: “Do you wanna play?” He knows he’ll end up on top.\n\nAt the very outset of the 1980s, Prince was ushering in a decade in which artists of color, queer artists, and women artists — this new breed of leaders — would similarly challenge the logic of cultural exclusion across all forms, from literature to poetry to dance to theater to the visual arts. Central to what we love about his winking brashness — the thing we hear in that signature yelp or that universe-shattering scream, that we see in his sidelong glance that says, as he did after his 2004 Grammys performance with perhaps his greatest understudy, Beyoncé, “Don’t hate us cause we fab” — is that he’s been clear since at least “Dirty Mind” that Black popular culture is America’s avant-garde, its most vibrant, rapidly evolving reminder of what freedom looks and sounds like.\n\nPrince’s utopic musical geographies came from actual geographies. Futurist imaginings arose from material histories. The history of segregation in the Twin Cities is no different than that of other American cities. But Andrea Swensson also reminds us that these segregated spaces supported rich creative ecosystems. Prince’s parents met in this scene, and his father played with the fathers of Andre Cymone and Jimmy Jam.\n\nShe also reminds us that the major protests of 2015 and 2016 took place where North Minneapolis’s Fourth Precinct had replaced the legendary Black community center and cultural hub called The Way, and on the I-94 highway in St. Paul where the Black cultural traffic of St. Paul’s historic Rondo neighborhood had been erased for white suburban and exurban automobile traffic. To conflate Orfield and Swensson via the Lewis Connection, the Twin Cities — and the rest of the country — had something there and they chose to destroy it. Remixing Joni Mitchell, they had paved paradise and put up a highway and a police station.\n\nIn 1967, tensions between North Minneapolis residents and police exploded into days and nights of fire, followed by the National Guard’s occupation of the neighborhood. “You wait two or three years while this generation comes along,” the Black community organizer named Harry “Spike” Moss told the Star newspaper. “They see that if you want anything, you got to take it.”[6]\n\nWhen the 1970s rolled in, that new generation, including Prince and all of his colleagues, could learn and hone their craft at The Way, the vital Black community center established in the heart of North Minneapolis on Plymouth Avenue in the wake of the unrest and led by Spike Moss. They could find opportunities to play in high school dances and parties, and a number of studios at which they could record.\n\nBusing in Minneapolis began just months after the unrest in North Minneapolis. Desegregation brought Prince from North to South Minneapolis. Prince sings about it on “The Sacrifice of Victor”, the concluding track of the Love Symbol album, with a sense of skepticism:\n\n1967 in a bus marked ‘Public Schools’\n\nRode me and a group of unsuspecting political tools\n\nOur parents wondered what it was like to have another color near\n\nSo they put their babies together to eliminate the fear\n\nBusing put Black students at risk and begat root shock, that condition of longing and disorientation that comes with displacement. But it also put Prince in touch with other communities of young Black musicians across the city and brought him into the orbit of white rock fans.\n\nAs important as James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, and Carlos Santana was to the young Prince, he also fell in love with the music of Joni Mitchell, Grand Funk Railroad, and Boz Scaggs. As his musical innovation hit an inflection point with “Dirty Mind” and “Controversy” and “1999,” you could hear Prince searching for a new synthesis. He was partly responding to the ambient soundscapes and rhythmic drive of new wave artists like Gary Numan, The Cars, and Elvis Costello and the Attractions.\n\nPop right now — in which genres and subgenres once dammed/damned and policed have, in the endless flow of streaming music, all but collapsed into an international style — feels like it is in a Prince moment. But it was not easy to arrive here. Prince had to stage a series of evasions and misdirections in order to birth this new pop world.\n\nOne of the enduring stories about the 18-year old Prince negotiating his first deal with Warner Brothers that would lift him out of Northwest Territory obscurity is that he refused to be marketed as a “Black artist.” The Kid who came up the son of a pioneering Twin Cities Black musician, playing at the Black power-oriented community center, and who got his first breaks through musicians he had though in the same musical networks that had nourished his parents, cousins, and friends decided that he had seek his success by pulling away. He soon found white patrons who treated him as if he were a new generation Stevie Wonder prodigy.\n\nIn the segregated pop market of the early 1980s, Prince understood that a warm welcome at Black radio could be a trap for an artist with musical ambitions like his. “I Wanna Be Your Lover” — a song that when placed back into context after 94 East’s “If You See Me” and The Loring Park Sessions demos, seems like a culmination of the late 70s Twin City funk scene — did break at Black radio first, leading to his infamous “Battle of Funk” tour with Rick James. But as Prince’s artistic vision cohered, he aspired to be bigger than even Rick James, who would witheringly say of him to Blues and Soul magazine: “He doesn’t want to be Black. My job is to keep reality over this little science fiction creep.”[7]\n\nPrince secured white rock publicist Howard Bloom to help engineer his crossover. When it came to music, Black meant every style that was niche and wasn’t white, and white meant rock and the big money, the entire market. Bloom made these racial politics clear in a memo to Prince’s manager:\n\nThe verdict from the press is clear: Prince is a rock and roll artist! In fact, the press is saying clearly that Prince is the first Black artist with the potential to become a major white audience superstar since Jimi Hendrix…And as the critics imply, the task with Prince is to hold his Black audience while aggressively pursuing the rock and New Wave audience.[8]\n\nIn an important interview for Rolling Stone, Prince told Bill Adler, “I grew up on the borderline. I had a bunch of white friends and a bunch of Black friends. I never grew up in one particular culture.” In the same breath, he began spinning tall tales about his supposed biraciality, inventing an Italian mother.[9]\n\nSuch a reading of his early moves make Prince seem not a little self-hating and even ungrateful. But the young star cannot but be aware that he has become what Eric Lott calls “the Black mirror — (a) black mask for my white face.”[10] Here, too, Prince’s crossover dream presages Obama’s — biraciality as a marker of the redemption and recuperation of whiteness, a process that Lott calls a “self-sustaining misrecognition.” In an early interview with Barbara Graustark, Prince gave a revealing answer to a throwaway question:\n\nGraustack: Do you feel a strong identification with anything . . . anybody?\n\nPrince: No. I think society says if you’ve got a little Black in you that’s what you are. I don’t. [11]\n\nAnother way to understand Prince’s moves is to historicize them. Both his father and mother led jazz lives that represented the complex joys and crushed dreams of Black artists who played in a segregated era. Music was a source of some of Prince’s childhood traumas. His powerful ambitions were rooted in an intimate sense of the costs of representing Blackness in a white world. And his experiences reminded him of how hard the color lines had been drawn, explained why he wished “there were no rules.” In 1981, when they were asked to join the Rolling Stones tour, fans violently bottled Prince and his band’s Black bodies, even as they cheered Mick Jagger and his band’s white performance of androgyny and drag.\n\nThe big payoff — better yet, the big payback — came the following year, when Prince, alongside Michael Jackson, dramatically desegregated rock radio and MTV with “Little Red Corvette.” The critic Bob Christgau wrote:\n\n’Little Red Corvette’ was Prince’s trans-genre genius in action — without it, MJ’s “Beat It” might never have cracked MTV. This kind of stage-tested, studio-documented proof that “rock” and “R&B” weren’t mutually exclusive — funk patterns blunted by arena scale, soulful singing intensified by virtuosic shredding — will remain his greatest achievement.[12]\n\nThe Prince of the 80s asks us to consider the gap between what he said and what he played. Even as he remained elusive with white journalists or reflected back to them what they wanted to hear, his music revealed an understanding of American pop that was much more complex. Prince had no time for distinguishing between “rock” and “R+B” the way overzealous Stones fans, critics, radio and television programmers, and the music industry did. It was all Black music to him.\n\nIn 1988, when Sign O the Times lost to The Joshua Tree at the Grammys for best album of the year, U2’s Bono said,\n\nWe set out to make music, soul music…It’s not about being Black or white or the instruments you play or whether you can use a drum machine or not. It’s a decision to reveal or conceal. And, without it people like Prince would be nothing more than a brilliant song-and-dance man. That he is, but he’s much more than that…\n\nLater, when asked later about Bono’s statement, Prince simply said,\n\nI’m not saying I’m better than anybody else. But you’ll be sitting there at the Grammys, and U2 will beat you. And you say to yourself, ’Wait a minute. I can play that kind of music, too. I played La Crosse [Wisconsin] growing up, I know how to do that, you dig? But you will not do ’Housequake.’”[13]\n\nAnd all of this helps explain why Prince demanded to be treated and heard the way white artists were, which is to say that he demanded complete access to the kind of critical universality granted them. In this way, he anticipated the concerns of what Thelma Golden would playfully label the “Post-Black” generation of contemporary visual artists — Glenn Ligon, Carrie Mae Weems, Lorna Simpson, Gary Simmons, and others — who made work that challenged white viewers to confront their assumptions about race in the first place. Those artists would suffer many of the same indignities Prince had — rejection, misinterpretation, revulsion.\n\nPrince is still said by some to have somehow “transcended race,” a peculiarly post-civil rights era notion. But his early culture moves seem less about fulfilling some colorblind ideal of American exceptionalism than about being strategic before a deeply segregated cultural landscape. What we hear in his music is Blackness as central to the imaginary of America, and Black art as an expression of Black liberation, and thereby freedom for all. The desegregation of American pop is a freedom move.\n\nThe Revolution, seemed to propel him even further in his still-evolving unified theory of pop. With its easy interraciality, strong women, and sometimes magical chemistry, the Revolution also challenged him to be more revealing and open. The Hallway Version of “Computer Blue” — with its “science fiction” overtones — reveals the band at its best, tearing through bewildering changes at breathtaking speed. Rooted in a piece by his father, John Nelson, elaborated and sharpened in long and fruitful jams with the band, and finally presented with stunning choreography and staging in the movie, here is Prince honoring debts and legacy while ferociously defining the sound of the future.\n\nAmidst national attacks on affirmative action, the Revolution embodied the idea of “diversity as excellence” before it became a mantra of neoliberal corporatism. And after desegregation, what? The Revolution took on “America” itself. Prince sings of cold-war brinksmanship and intensifying inequality. He also signals a Reagan-era patriotism, criticizing “Jimmy Nothing” who won’t pledge allegiance to the flag.\n\nBut here, too, the music and video complicate a simple reading. According to legend, the Revolution locked into a monstrous groove which continued for 5 hours straight. Twenty-one minutes ended up on one side of the 12-inch single, faded down because the tape ran out. Wendy Melvoin would later say, “To this day, we can put that track on and feel that band’s energy and feel what we were like at our best together — a fucking freight train.”[14]\n\nNo mystery train here — it was the sound of struggle and synchrony, the band as the dream of America itself barreling forward in time and space. When they played the song in the official video, they performed the song live in front of a French audience in Nice, with a massive red, black, and green Pan-African liberation flag proudly displayed behind them. Prince had already transformed binaries into dialectics — placing supposed opposites in conversation and relation with each other — Black/white, straight/gay, sex/apocalypse, fear/joy. Now here was his synthesis, unfurled in a musical rendering of “America”. This train was bound for Freedom, Love, Joy, Peace.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Prince could no longer ignore the ascent of hip-hop. On Sign O’ The Times, he countered with “Housequake”, part tribute, part taunt: “Shut up already, damn.” But by The Black Album, he seemed to have conceded the balance of power had shifted to a younger, hungrier cohort of bedroom musicians emerging from Long Island to Compton. The New Power Generation, a band deliberately and decidedly Black — Rosie Gaines said that their job was to win back Prince’s Black audiences — was in place when Los Angeles erupted in rebellion.\n\n1992 was a significant year for Prince in a different, but somehow deeply related reason. It was the year he renegotiated his contract with Warner Brothers, and the start of a personal revolution.\n\nHe could not have missed the hip-hop generation’s critique of the music industry, leveled in songs like A Tribe Called Quest’s “Check The Rhime” and in Public Enemy’s disputes with Def Jam and white critics. By contrast Prince was working from a position of strength and he would leverage what some called the biggest contract in history, a reported $100 million deal that included a 20% royalty rate, bonus incentives, lucrative publishing advances, Paisley Park label funding, and a Vice President position that made him eligible for stock options.\n\nBut by 1993, the year Dr. Dre began hip-hop’s conquering of pop[15], the year that Wu-Tang Clan began its journey toward securing control of their own master recordings, Prince decided he could no longer comply with the way business had been done. On his 35th birthday, he decided to rename himself and announced that he would not release new music through Warners. At the Brit Awards he told the crowd, “In concert: free. On record: slave. Peace.”\n\nThe reaction was swift and brutal. Warners shuttered Paisley Park Records and removed him from their leadership. Pundits and even close friends and co-workers ridiculed him. They scoffed that if he was a slave, he was one of the best paid ever, that he should have been grateful. They said he had no right to compare his condition to that of the real slaves from whom he was descended. In fact, as Alex Hahn has found, his father shared a name with Prince’s slaveholding great-great-grandfather.[16]\n\nIn a 1998 interview in Guitar World with Serge Simonaert, Prince said:\n\nSuppose you’re a young musician and you want to make a record because you have something to say musically. Well, the record company usually makes you sign away the rights to your songs. In other words, you become a slave to them in the sense that they own the rights to the master recordings of your music for all time, and you’re merely an employee. So if you don’t own your master, your master owns you. And what we’ve been trying to do with the NPG label, what it stands for, is trying to create more freedom, including financial freedom, so that artists control their own Genesis and can reach a much brighter Revelation.[17]\n\nWe know that Prince wanted to release more than the record industry, at the peak of its economic power, could countenance, a position driven by scarcity economics and blockbuster financing that now seem laughable since the industry imploded post-Napster. The more enduring battle over artistic control pitted notions of the artist as a crucible of creativity and bearer of culture against the notion of artist as commodity.\n\nIf one only imagines cultural exchange through the terms set by capitalism, then The Artist appears at best ungrateful, at worst a bad actor in a system that has richly rewarded him. But Prince had launched a sophisticated attack on racial capitalism: he was a commodity. And this realization must have had the force of an awakening: he related his fight over musical control to the historic and continuing exploitation of Blacks and the white extraction of profit from Black culture.\n\nRacial capitalism was capable of building new schemes of containment through copyright and so-called “intellectual property” that dispossessed artists, particularly Black artists, of all of their agency.[18] Prince was asking, “If my ass follows, can my mind be free?” And his answer was that freedom is the right to benefit from the fruits of one’s individual creativity and culture-ways.\n\nSome things had changed in 400 years. We could now contemplate a horizon of post-raciality — distant and ever disappearing, to be sure — because of Black freedom movements and Black freedom culture. Prince told Simonaert:\n\nI want to be judged on the quality of my work, not on what I say, nor on what people claim I am, nor on the color of my skin.\n\nHe seemed to be invoking the Martin Luther King, Jr. of the neoconservative imagination — the supposedly colorblind, completely dehistoricized, and wholly reappropriated King. Yet in the same interview Prince continued:\n\nBut you have to have a certain empathy in order to understand a situation. Like when people made fun of my name change. It was mostly white people, because black people empathize with wanting to change a situation. My last name, Nelson, is really a slave name. A hundred years ago it meant “son of Nell,” and it was white slave owners who gave it to their slaves, so why should I go by that name now? Why not do what Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X did?[19]\n\nHe wanted to take back this first-order power to name. Renaming himself connected his struggle for creative independence and his personal history as a descendant of slaves to the larger struggle for Black freedom.\n\nThe debasement of the African in Blackface minstrelsy was one of the two foundational narratives of American popular culture (the other was the taming and killing of the Indian in the Wild West show). But African Americans reappropriated the elements of minstrelsy — song, dance, comedy, performance — for liberatory ends, forever transforming the music and performing arts of the young nation. Ever afterwards, American popular culture claimed to be carrying the mantle of freedom all around the world. But we have never repaid the debt to those who turned American pop from a culture of debasement, Othering and death into one of community, liberation and life.\n\nBy writing SLAVE on his cheek, Prince did what Martin Luther King, Jr. had done in August 1963 on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. He called upon America to acknowledge and repay the debts it owed African Americans. King had called for political enfranchisement, Prince for cultural equity and cultural justice. In this light, it makes perfect sense that in his final years Prince would be galvanized by a new breed of leaders — mostly queer Black women — who had named the stakes, had connected cultural power and political power to the central question of Black lives.\n\nPrince’s tour schedule became a way for him to quietly meet with local Black community organizers around the country. After the murder of Oscar Grant, for instance, Prince spent a lot of time in Oakland, meeting with organizers, activists, and families. He did the same in Baltimore and elsewhere. Often anonymously, he quietly funded grassroots campaigns and organizations engaged in struggles against police brutality and for civil rights, economic and environmental justice.\n\nHe took on a Harry Belafonte-like role bridging freedom fighters and cultural leaders. He organized private salons with people like Van Jones, Tavis Smiley, Cornel West, Dick Gregory, and Black grassroots activists to talk about how to move forward. Unlike Belafonte, he chose to remain largely a student rather than a spokesperson, and to forefront his music and use primarily the platforms music had given him. Perhaps had he lived longer he might have concluded that he could stand alongside the new breed.\n\nIt is also telling that, after his struggle with Warner Brothers ended with him re-signing to the label and taking control of his own masters, he began making some of the best music of his career — music that is much less heralded than his 1980s work, but that reveals effortless craft, emotional depth, and endless surprise.\n\nPerhaps tragedy had clarified the path of the Purple Moses. In the years after his son Amiir and his parents died, he retreated to lyric-less, free-flowing blues and jazz jams. Then his words seemed to return as he received the recognition he had once worked so hard to attain. He owned the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Grammy stage like he had never left, and now he spoke to wartime racism, climate justice, and the divided nation.\n\nSome of the best music of his latter years — “Dreamer”, “Baltimore”, “Black Sweat”, “Black Muse” — revealed both new complexity and a return to familiar themes. Musicology’s irresistible slow jam, “Call My Name,” has him spotlighting lovemaking as the ultimate act of creativity, resistance, and transformation. In “Do Me Baby”, he had sung to his lover, “I won’t stop until the war is over.” Now he couldn’t help but insert an entire verse linking their coupling to saving the planet from the surveillance state and the forever war.\n\nIn concert he slotted in covers of his favorite songs — “Just My Imagination”, “We’re A Winner”, “Rock Steady” — alongside his own, providing history lessons for the kids, and ample evidence of his own enduring importance. He featured women prominently. He seemed at ease and perfectly happy with the role of the respected elder. In public and private, he represented mastery and generosity.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, my partner and I and 20,000 other fans attended his Piano and A Microphone show at the Oracle Arena. The crowd looked like a Paisley Park dream, spiked with Oakland specificity — women in Saturday-fly sequins and stillettos, men in purple suits, Raiders hats, and Warriors jerseys, the rainbow children drawn in an almost holy kind of ritual. Boots Riley was there, and we got to talking about how Prince had stolen his DJ Pam the Funkstress (he was still at it!) and renamed her Purple Pam, which Pam had hilariously complicated feelings about.\n\nAs the lights dimmed, Prince wheeled out from backstage on a purple bike, his cane over his forearm. As the screens above displayed colorful images of moving fractals — almost as if he had just read Adrienne Maree Brown’s book, Emergent Strategy — he mounted a stage in the center of the arena where there was only piano and an electric keyboard. We cheered and cheered. He teased, “Remember that time we first met? That was good.” Then he hunched over the black and white keys and went to work solo, some of the most beautiful labor ever heard.\n\nHe played a delicate version of “Somewhere Over The Rainbow,” then transitioned into “Somewhere Here On Earth,” which ends with the words, “It’s time to heal. No, no more hurt as long as I’m here on earth.” He followed with “Baltimore,” extending that feeling into a dialogue with Ice Cube, Martin Luther King, Jr., Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, and the young rebels in the streets. Later he played “Controversy” and ”I Would Die 4 U” as a medley, these manifestos of coming together. And he threaded together Bob Marley’s “Waiting In Vain”, “If I Was Your Girlfriend,” and “How Come U Don’t Call Me Anymore,” songs of unbearable longing.\n\nWe hung onto every syllable, every tremor in his voice, every exhalation. In each and every note, we came to feel the high-wire he was crossing over us, that not only did each sound need to be a beautiful sound, but also a constellation, the songs forming a sky in which we could see our own desires and everyone else’s. We began to react to each other’s reactions. When he pressed some buttons on his synthesizer and it spit out the beat to “When Doves Cry,” our screams — for more, what else? — rose into a roaring cascade of belief.\n\nBy the end of the second encore, we were on our feet, chanting “Free yourself!”\n\nHe stepped to each side of the stage — North, East, West, South — and repeated the same gesture: he raised his hands into an arc over his head and bowed deeply, which only made us try to find that deeper sound in our chests. When he disappeared into the darkness, we stomped and clapped. When he came back onstage, he played two chords and sang, “Until the end of time, I’ll be there for you.”\n\nWho couldn’t have been overcome? What couldn’t have been overcome?\n\nAnd then, more than two hours after he had begun, he was gone.\n\n++++\n\n[1] http://www.startribune.com/already-low-homeownership-rates-of-twin-cities-minorities-fall-further-down/441087863/\n\n[2] https://www.twincities.com/2017/08/18/15-years-later-mn-schools-are-more-segregated-and-achievement-gap-has-barely-budged/\n\n[3] https://reason.org/wp-content/uploads/files/weighted_student_formula_minneapolis.pdf\n\n[4] From the Institute On Metropolitan Opportunity’s report, “Why Are The Twin Cities So Segregated?” https://www.law.umn.edu/sites/law.umn.edu/files/why-are-the-twin-cities-so-segregated-2-26-15.pdf\n\n[5] https://www.law.umn.edu/sites/law.umn.edu/files/why-are-the-twin-cities-so-segregated-2-26-15.pdf\n\n[6] Check out the amazing Purple Snow boxset of pre-Prince 1970s Twin Cities Funk from Numero Group.\n\n[7] Cited in Dave Hill’s Prince: A Pop Life, pp. 80.

Listening to Planet Earth’s “Guitar” from 2007, it’s clear that Prince has buried the hatchet. The hook is a playful near-facsimile of The Edge’s guitar line from “I Will Follow”, and the song that turns on both his cutting sense of humor and the same “watch me slay you” bravado that he brought to his 2004 Grammy solo on “While My Guitar Gently Weeps.”\n\n[14] From Matt Thorne’s book Prince: The Man and His Music, p. 125.\n\n[15] Post-NWA, Dr. Dre’s arch-nemesis Eazy-E wanted everyone to know the doc had learned everything from Prince.

These two concerns came together on a Future of Music Coalition panel. I sat between Hank Shocklee and George Clinton listening to an astonishing exchange. George told Hank that he wanted Hank to sample his work, but Bridgeport Music, the notorious copyright trolls, controlled his copyrights, not himself. The marketplace has literally seized control of process of intergenerational passing-on of culture-ways."
