We have helped many personal injury victims receive\n\nmillions of dollars.\n\nIf you already have a personal injury attorney but are not happy with his or her services, it‚Äôs okay to change representation, even mid-case. We‚Äôll walk you through the process.\n\nSteps for Filing a Personal Injury Claim\n\nIt‚Äôs essential to have a general idea of each step of the legal process. These steps can be altered, depending on the specifics of your case. Your personal injury lawyer can address any concerns you may have along the way.\n\nConsultation\n\nWhen you contact one of our compassionate personal injury lawyers in Atlanta, we can help you decide whether or not to go forward with legal action. During this case evaluation, your attorney will look at the details of your accident and begin to determine negligence.\n\nFile Your Personal Injury Claim\n\nOnce it gets established that you have a valid case, your attorney will begin by drafting and filing your personal injury claim to submit to the Georgia civil court system. You can choose, at this point, to pursue negotiations for a personal injury settlement or an in-house trial.\n\nMediation, also known as settlement negotiations, in personal injury cases is when both parties and their respective insurance companies meet outside of court to reach an agreement. It‚Äôs ideal and cost-effective if the case settles out of court in mediation.\n\nShould you pursue a civil trial, you can expect to undergo:\n\nDiscovery\n\nOpening statement\n\nExamination\n\nCross-examination\n\nClosing statements\n\nDeliberation\n\nHow Much Time Do I Have to File an Injury Case in Atlanta?\n\nThe time limit, or statute of limitations, within which you can legally file a claim varies greatly. That‚Äôs why the sooner you call a lawyer near you, the better. According to OCGA ¬ß9-3-33, you have two years from the date of your injuries or your family member‚Äôs death to file your personal injury claim.\n\nThese statutes of limitations are relevant for civil cases such as car accidents, wrongful death, and other personal injury claims.\n\nThat said, government entities, Native American reservations, and cruise ships all have their own laws. In these cases, the statute of limitations period could be very, very short, in some cases just weeks.\n\nHow Much Money Is This Going to Cost Me?\n\nHiring a car accident lawyer will not cost you anything upfront. We take our fee as a percentage of your settlement. That‚Äôs zero charges upfront and zero charges if we should not make a recovery. You have no risk.\n\nOur goal in all our cases is to get our clients as much money as we can as quickly as we can. The first and most important part, however, is getting you healthy and back to your life as much as possible. Then we can put a value on your case.\n\nYou can get a free consultation no matter how many times you need our advice, and our personal injury lawyer‚Äôs service costs nothing until your case is officially won. We don‚Äôt take cases we don‚Äôt think we can win.\n\nHow Much Will My Settlement Be?\n\nThis is a question that doesn‚Äôt have one concrete answer. How much your settlement will depend on the type of personal injury case you‚Äôre filing a claim for. For example, a moderate car accident case will recover around $30,000. Still, a severe car accident that leads to permanent disability or disfigurement can lead to a settlement worth several million dollars.\n\nThis all depends on a few key factors:\n\nHow severe your accident was\n\nThe damages you have sustained\n\nHow severe your damages are and how much they‚Äôve negatively impacted your life\n\nWhether or not you can work after your accident\n\nThere‚Äôs so much that goes into the value of your settlement that it‚Äôs impossible to tell how much it‚Äôs worth without first consulting with one of our personal injury attorneys.\n\nWhat if You Are Partly at Fault?\n\nAccording to the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (OCGA) ¬ß51-12-33, Georgia follows a modified comparative negligence rule. Therefore, if you, the plaintiff, are found guilty by the courts to be more than 50% at fault for the accident, you will lose the right to any recovery. However, you are still eligible for compensation if you are less than 49% responsible.\n\nThe judge will reduce the amount you are awarded damages in proportion to the percentage of fault. For example, a plaintiff the courts find 10% responsible for the accident would receive $90,000 of a $100,000 award or 90% of the total award amount.\n\nWhat Makes John Foy & Associates Different From the Other Personal Injury Lawyers?\n\n‚ÄúOnce we get a case we‚Äôre partners,‚Äù says Foy. ‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre a big firm, I don‚Äôt need to take the quick settlement. I can afford to do that.‚Äù\n\nWe‚Äôre larger than most firms so we don‚Äôt have the financial pressures to settle a case right away. If the trial needs 10 expert witnesses, we have the cash flow to support that. We‚Äôve been in business for more than 25 years and we‚Äôre successful at what we do. Our advocates have long-term relationships with healthcare providers and professionals. We can counsel you toward the best medical care. And because we have a comfortable inventory of cases, no one file is going to impact us so much that a Foy car accident lawyer would push you to settle. We can afford to go the distance and maximize your case.\n\nHow a Personal Injury Lawyer in Atlanta Can Help\n\nThere are many reasons it‚Äôs worth getting a personal injury attorney in Atlanta after an accident. Here are just a few of the things we will do for you to make winning a settlement easier.\n\nGathering Evidence Related to Your Claim\n\nEven though the law supports you with the right to file a claim, that doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically receive financial compensation. You still have to prove fault and negligence with solid evidence. While you rest and recover from your injuries, our lawyers will be hard at work looking for evidence and other critical information to support your claim.\n\nRepresenting Your Best Interests\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to negotiate on your own or go to court. We will represent your best interests at all times and ensure that your voice gets heard. We won‚Äôt let the insurance company dominate the floor and make you look bad. Our goal is to win you the best settlement possible for your claim, and we will fight hard for you.\n\nConsulting with Professionals\n\nEven with strong evidence, sometimes you‚Äôll need extra support to ensure that the insurance company can‚Äôt weasel their way out of paying you a fair settlement. We can consult with medical professionals, accident reconstruction experts, and forensic experts to support your case. This way, there is no doubt or uncertainty that the negligent party was at fault for what happened to you.\n\nCalculating Your Damages Accurately\n\nCalculating your damages accurately can be confusing. There‚Äôs a lot more that goes into it than just adding up bills and receipts. We can also calculate future medical expenses and non-economic damages that don‚Äôt have a fixed monetary value. So we won‚Äôt leave a single penny off of your final settlement total.\n\nNo one should ever give a recorded statement to an insurance company, even their own insurance company, without consulting an attorney first.\n\nWhat Questions Can I Expect in the Initial Interview?\n\nIn your free consultation, an experienced car accident lawyer will ask some important questions about your situation:\n\nWhat is the extent of your injuries?\n\nAre the damages permanent?\n\nIs there scarring?\n\nDo you need time away from work?\n\nHow much are the medical bills?\n\nDo you need future treatment?\n\nWere you on the job when it happened?\n\nWill you need a vehicle?\n\nOur personal injury lawyers address property damage and your health first. You need to get back to work; you need to go to the doctor. We get you medical care if you don‚Äôt have insurance. Our goal is to get you back to optimal health before we even put a price tag on the case. Your responsibility is to follow your doctor‚Äôs instructions and get the prescribed help necessary.\n\nHow Do I Get in Touch With a Lawyer Near Me?\n\nWe‚Äôre here, ready to listen and assist. Call an attorney near you today at 404-471-3348 or fill out our Free Case Evaluation Form to have us begin working on your case immediately and get the prescribed help necessary."
