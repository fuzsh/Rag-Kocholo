I take photos of whatever is readily available at the time. Sometimes it's my wife and other times it's birds, flowers and other nature.\n\nThanks for the group invite. I keep trying to find groups with more participation than others. I'm hoping this might be the one.\n\nDavid\n\nages ago\n\nFitzrovia says:\n\nHullo. Thanks for the invitation to join the group. I am Amro from England. I live in Cambridge and Liverpool.\n\nI'm experimenting with all kinds of cameras and films. I constantly take photos - especially with my mobile camera.\n\nI love 120 medium format film and the Rolleiflex TLR. I have recently started using 35mm film in the Konica Hexar. Before that I used a Leica M4-P, and a Nikon F3.\n\nIn the digital world, I mainly use a Panasonic Micro 4/3s camera with a variety of lenses. I also have access to a Sony camera.\n\nThanks!\n\nages ago\n\nNick Stanley says:\n\nAhoy hoy, living in Kitchener Ontario I enjoy shooting everything. From macro flower photography to multi-frame panoramas I love it all. I am attempting to become more comfortable with photographing people. Recently I volunteered to shoot at a couple of events in town and really enjoyed the experience of capturing that perfectly real and honest expression on a stranger's face. I haven't been this excited since I began taking pictures.\n\nI have been taking photos since I was a child, but it wasn't until I got my Olympus E-PL1 and started working with RAW files did I really start to understand how to turn it into art. Now I shoot with an OM-D E-M5 and a plethora of M43 lenses as well as a number of 35mm SLRs and Polaroids.\n\nages ago\n\nDavid Renwald says:\n\nHi Daphne!.....As I read through the introductions from so many interesting people around the world what stands out is the simple and uncomplicated love of photography, not the obsession with gear and technical foolery. In that vein I will be posting pics from my old film cameras: a Pentax 6x7; a Mamiya M645; and my little favorite, a Kodak Retinette IA rangefinder that I bought for $26 in a second hand store. Cheers from the beautiful Columbia River in the state of Washington, USA!\n\nages ago\n\nSmirfman says:\n\nFirstly thanks for the invite it's an honour , my name is Paul (AKA Smirf ) , been shooting for about 6 years going through a Sony range of bodies , a100 , a350 and a550 until 4 weeks ago when I bought into the Nikn range , going in with a Nikon d7100 ... A nice body , with some sharp show coming through , I reside in the Uk in a small town called Paignton , Devon .... Hope you enjoy my shots that come through\n\nRegards Smirf\n\nages ago\n\nBlende57 says:\n\nHi,\n\nThanks for the invite, Daphne. My name's Heinz and I am from Germany. I take a shot at everything that grabs my eye, which most of the time is drawn towards light, patterns, structures and color - ideally all at once. I have a trusty 5D Mark II, and most often use the 17-40mm wide angle lens that is just so versatile on full format. My motto is: no camera, no picture - and so I lug the 5D with me whenever I can. You never know what's around the corner. And even without a camera on hand I find myself observing my surrounding through a viewfinder's eye, often making my family wait for me while I stand there, steeped in thought :-)\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nBlende57 edited this topic ages ago.\n\nemrold says:\n\nThank you for the invitation! My name is Eric, I'm in my mid-40's, a father of two and am from Ottawa, Ontario - Canada's capital.\n\nI currently shoot with a Canon EOS M, a Canon EOS 60D, a Canon PowerShot S95 and a Nokia Lumia 920. Since I'm currently participating in a 365 project, I post at least one picture per day. I don't have a preferred style - you'll see that my photostream is all over the map! - but I don't do many portraits.\n\nI'm looking forward to sharing with you!\n\nCheers,\n\nE.\n\nages ago\n\narawak812 says:\n\nThanks Daphne for the invite; I'm Julio from The Bronx currently in Malaysia just sitting here doing time with a camera. My specialty is stitch photography in which I've graduated from being a mushroom to the digital age since PhotoShop 4 in the mid '90's. Whatever I do do, it can be done now with any digital camera left with the factory setting in place. I hope you like my art works.\n\nages ago\n\nLuis Bacigalupo says:\n\nHi. Thank you for the invitation. My name is Luis and I live in Lima, Peru. I work as a professor at a local university and like to take photos even when I should be doing something else. I concentrate on candid people portraits and street B&W photography, mostly in my city and also B&W landscape when I'm traveling around the country, which I do whenever I can. I currently shoot with a Nikon D90 and a Fuji X10.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nLuis Bacigalupo edited this topic ages ago.\n\nJames Q. Payne says:\n\nHi, my name is James, and I am a graphic designer and web developer from DFW, Texas, USA. I shoot both film and digital. Photography is a relatively new hobby for me, I have been shooting for about two years (when I got a Canon Rebel T3 as a wedding gift). 3 months ago I was given a Pentax K1000 and my love of film photography began. I have since picked up another K1000, an Argus C44R, and a couple other film cameras. I welcome honest and constructive criticism, like I said, I am very new to photography and always looking to improve.\n\nages ago\n\naproudlove says:\n\nHi,\n\nThanks a lot for the invitation, my name is Andrew Proudlove and I am a British expat who has spent a few years in the states and the past 15 years in the Czech Republic.\n\nMy hobbies are art and photography, I photograph mostly with an iPhone 5 and a Sony Nex 6. I got into photography again a couple of years back and since then I've had the good fortune to have had some of my work exhibited in galleries.\n\nStill have a lot to learn though and am learning more and more each day from other talented artists and photographs and so I am looking forward to learning a lot and getting to know a lot of you in this community :)\n\nAndrew\n\nages ago\n\nlevel page [deleted] says:\n\nHi everyone, and thanks for the invite! My name is Dave, and I live in Cincinnati, Ohio. My Flickr project \"Finding Cincinnati\" is about connecting with my own community, and sharing all the nature, landscapes, people, and places that are right here near my own home. It's amazing what I continue to learn by venturing out with a camera and viewing everything through a focused (and sometimes not so focused) lens. I shoot with older, budget equipment- a Canon Rebel XT (350D), and a growing collection of EF lenses. The photo stream here is amazing, and I look forward to soaking it all in and learning from the high calibre of contributions in this group!\n\nages ago\n\nlong-term fnord [deleted] says:\n\n'Ello! My name is Mitch and i'm based in the Cotswolds UK. I am a self employed professional shooter for about 2 years now. I mostly enjoy taking landscapes, nature and monochromes but I also do like to dabble in architectural work and abstracts. If you are interested feel free to check my website at www.ayalem.com where I have my work in slideshows set to music from some of my favourite artists that I am collaborating with. I look forward to seeing some inspirational work in here and wish you all the best with the light!\n\nages ago\n\nBrigitte_Mulders says:\n\nThank you for the invite !!\n\nI am Brigitte, and live in the south of the Netherlands, near 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nBought my first DSRL two years ago and love it every day more since then ;-)\n\nI only have two lenses, 18-270mm and 40mm micro lens. Really happy with both of them.\n\nOn January 1st I started with a 365 days project and I learned a lot picking up the camera every day. Sometimes it is hard to find the inspiration, but some days inspirations turns up by itself.\n\nages ago\n\nSquiddy1963 says:\n\nHi, guys! I'm Les, and I live in Dorset, in the UK. It's a fantastic part of the world for the photographer, with coastal, farmland, and city landscapes, as well as the wonderful New Forest in neighbouring Hampshire.\n\nI like to shoot and create unusual images, which tend to be heavy on manipulation and processing. I love to mix 35mm film and digital images. I've been using GIMP for about a year, now, and although I would not, by any means, call myself an expert user, I have seen my skills rockets over that time, and I love using it. I also use Lightroom 3, which is a fantastic piece of editing software.\n\nages ago\n\njazzy downtown [deleted] says:\n\nHello! Thanks for the invite to the group:)\n\nMy name's Connor, I'm 21 and from Wales, UK. I bought my first camera a couple of months ago, (Sony nex 5n) and I'm loving taking photos! I'm a complete novice, and have picked up what I do know from trial and error and lots of reading online.\n\nAs I'm still new to photography, I can't exactly say theres a particular style that's my favourite yet, so watch this space I guess! I'll definitely be taking lots of inspiration from the wonderful work in this group:)\n\nages ago\n\nOnigirism_ says:\n\nHello, I'm Max, 23, French, currently living in the Netherlands, but I've got a lot of photos from New-Zealand that I'm still taking care of.\n\nI started just before going to this spectacular place 4 months ago, when I bought my first camera, a Panasonic Lumix GX1. I am quite creative with my photos, and I often try to give them a mystical/ chiaroscuro aspect.\n\nThank you for inviting me in this group!\n\nages ago\n\nbalaji542 says:\n\nHey, thanks for inviting me to the group!\n\nMy name is Balaji, I'm 32 and from India. I live in Mumbai but I've been traveling for the last 5 years, so most of my pictures are related to my travels. I love shooting landscapes, abstracts, historical objects and anything that catches my eye when I'm on the road. I've had a Canon 550D just for a year or so and am still learning how to use it more effectively to make good pictures. I hope I can learn a little bit from the pictures people post in the pool here!\n\nages ago\n\nSannan Dogar (A nomad from the Roof of the World) says:\n\nHello & Warm Greetings to Everyone out here, hope all of you are having a wonderful time taking wonderful pictures all the time :) Well my name is Sannan & i'm from Pakistan. Photography has been a relatively new interest to me & i must say the Flickr community has a huge part to play in inspiring me towards opting it, almost everyday i run on to a picture that makes me say oh man how did he/she manage that sort of a picture, i'm really getting addicted to Flickr :) I mostly do Landscapes, Mountain Photography & Forest photography as they are in abundance here in Pakistan & much of them are unexplored & hidden to the outside world only a handful of trekkers, climbers and passionate photographers venture out in the wilderness to capture these stunning scenes of Northern Pakistan which is home to 4 of the Highest mountain ranges of the world, The Karakorums, The Himalaya's, The Hindu Kush & The Pamirs. I'm a self taught photographer & i wish to keep it that way but a few tips here & there are always welcomed & helpful. My Favorite photographer & personal inspiration is Atif Saeed the Magnificent Landscaper from Pakistan. At the moment my photostream has a short collection as i dont like to rush through my pictures, overflowing my photostream but i have a huge collection in store which i'll be uploading soon & sharing with my new friends here :)\n\nages ago\n\nfroststrand says:\n\nhello i call myself froststrand .i'm doing a 365 project,i shoot mostly intentional camera movement ,i shoot the dying sky and found light. i use what i call a panning arc method sometimes ,usually when the subject is not moving, but sometimes when they are,it's like they're the planet and i'm the moon, it turns points of light in the background into streaks or shmears of light.\n\nnext year i hope to build a prop or a set once a week, i've always enjoyed street photography but i look forward to being able to say something.\n\nthanks for the invite\n\nages ago"
