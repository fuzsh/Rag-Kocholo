        "text": "Albert II (born June 6, 1934, Brussels, Belgium) was the king of the Belgians from 1993 to 2013.\n\nThe second son of King Leopold III, Albert was educated at home and in Geneva and Brussels and entered the Belgian navy in 1953. From 1962 until his ascent, he served as honorary chairman of the Belgian Office of Foreign Trade, leading some 70 important trade missions and becoming an expert on shipping. He also served as the longtime president of the Belgian Red Cross and as a member of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nIn 1959 he married Paola Ruffo di Calabria, an Italian princess. The couple had three children: Philippe (born 1960), Astrid (born 1962), and Laurent (born 1963). Albert succeeded his childless older brother Baudouin after the latterâ€™s death in July 1993. Though many had speculated that he would abdicate in favour of his eldest son, Albert was sworn in as sixth king of the Belgians on August 9, 1993. An avid motorcycle rider, Albert in 2003 celebrated the 10th anniversary of his coronation by kick-starting a commemorative parade of some 20,000 bikers."
