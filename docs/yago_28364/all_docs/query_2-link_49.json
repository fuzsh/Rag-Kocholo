        "text": "Philippe, king of Belgium (born April 15, 1960, Brussels, Belgium) is the king of the Belgians from 2013.\n\nPhilippe was the first of three children of Albert II, who became Belgium’s sixth king in 1993. He received his early education in both Flemish and French, after which he attended the Royal Military Academy and studied abroad at Trinity College, Oxford, and at Stanford University, where he earned a master’s degree (1985) in political science. He trained as a pilot and paratrooper and ultimately held the rank of lieutenant general in both the Belgian army and air force and of vice admiral in the Belgian navy. It had been expected in 1993, upon the death of King Baudouin I, that Albert would abdicate in favour of Philippe, but Albert elected to take the throne, and some speculated that Philippe, then 33 and unmarried, was not yet prepared to lead the country. Philippe was appointed honorary chairman of the Belgian Foreign Trade Board in 1993 and in that capacity conducted numerous visits abroad. From 1993 he also served as chairman of the National (now Federal) Council for Sustainable Development. In June 1994 he became a member of the Belgian Senate.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
