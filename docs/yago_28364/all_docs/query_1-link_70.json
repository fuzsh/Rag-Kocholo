        "text": "History of the royal family\n\nThe Royal Family of Belgium has a long and complex history that dates back to the 19th century.\n\nThe current monarch is King Philippe, who ascended to the throne in July 2013 after the abdication of his father, King Albert II. Prior to becoming king, he served as the head of state from 1995 until his accession.\n\nThe reigning dynasty in Belgium is the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which originated in Germany but adopted the name “Saxe-Coburg” in 1867. The first member of this dynasty to rule over Belgium was King Leopold I, who reigned from 1831 until his death in 1865.\n\nUnder King Leopold III, Belgium faced significant challenges during World War I and II. He abdicated in favor of his son, Baudouin, in 1951 due to health issues.\n\nKing Baudouin’s reign saw significant changes within the monarchy, including the establishment of the Belgian constitutional monarchy and the modernization of the country’s economy. His son, King Albert II, assumed the throne upon his father’s abdication in 1993.\n\nIn recent years, there have been several scandals involving members of the royal family, including the separation and subsequent divorce of King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, as well as allegations of financial misconduct against some members of the family.\n\nCurrent members of the royal family\n\nThe current members of the Royal Family of Belgium are King Philippe and Queen Mathilde.\n\nKing Philippe was born on April 15, 1960, in Brussels, as the eldest son of King Albert II and Queen Paola. He studied at the Catholic University of Leuven and later worked for several years as an investment banker in New York City before returning to Belgium to assume his role as heir apparent.\n\nQueen Mathilde was born on February 20, 1973, in Lausanne, Switzerland, as the daughter of a French-Swiss businessman and a Belgian noblewoman. She attended university in France and Germany and has worked as a speech therapist prior to her marriage.\n\nThe couple has four children: Prince Gabriel (born May 20, 2003), Princess Eleonore (born June 24, 2008), Prince Louis (born March 16, 2010), and Princess Leonore (born January 12, 2014).\n\nLine of succession to the Belgian throne\n\nThe current line of succession to the Belgian throne is as follows:\n\n1. King Philippe of Belgium\n\n2. Crown Prince Léopold of Belgium (son of King Philippe)\n\n3. Princess Eleonore of Belgium (daughter of King Philippe)\n\n4. Prince Gabriel of Belgium (grandson of King Philippe)\n\n5. Princess Louise of Belgium (granddaughter of King Philippe)\n\n6. Prince Joachim of Belgium (great-grandson of King Albert II)\n\n7. Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium (great-granddaughter of King Albert II)\n\n8. Prince Nicolas of Belgium (great-grandson of King Albert II)\n\n9. Princess Mathilde of Belgium (wife of King Philippe)\n\nThe Belgian constitution states that the monarch must be a Catholic and can neither marry nor remarry without the consent of both Houses of Parliament. In addition, if the monarch dies while still married, their spouse will not become king or queen regnant but instead reign jointly with the heir apparent until the latter reaches majority age.\n\nMembers of the extended royal family\n\nMembers of the extended royal family include King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium, their children Prince Gabriel, Princess Eleonore, and Prince Louis, as well as other members of the Belgian royal family such as King Albert II’s sister Princess Marie-Christine and her husband Count Rodolphe de Limburg Stirum.\n\nAdditionally, there are several other members of the Belgian nobility who are related to the royal family through marriage or descent, including King Albert II’s cousin Princess Margriet of the Netherlands and her husband Pieter van Vollenhoven, as well as King Leopold III’s grandson Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este.\n\nRoyal titles and styles in Belgium\n\nThe Royal Family of Belgium holds several royal titles and styles.\n\nThe reigning monarch is styled as King/Queen of the Belgians. Other members of the immediate family are also given specific titles based on their gender and relationship to the monarch. For example, the spouse of the reigning monarch is styled as Queen/King Consort, while the children of the reigning monarch are styled as Prince/Princess of Belgium. Additionally, other close relatives such as siblings or cousins may be granted certain titles depending on their rank within the family hierarchy.\n\nOfficial residences of the Belgian royal family\n\nThe official residences of the Belgian royal family include several palaces and castles.\n\nThe main residence of the King and Queen is the Palace of Laeken, located in Brussels. It was built in 1906 for King Leopold II and has been the official residence of the reigning monarch since then.\n\nAnother important palace is the Palace of Cinquantenaire, also located in Brussels. It was built to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence in 1880 and served as the royal palace until the construction of the Palace of Laeken.\n\nOther notable residences include the Palace of Bouchout, which is used by the king and queen when they visit their son Prince Lorenz, who lives there with his family; the Castle of Fagus, which is used by the queen mother; and the Château de Spa, which is used by the prince and princesses during their summer vacations.\n\nPublic engagements of the Belgian royal family\n\nThe Royal Family of Belgium is known for their public engagements.\n\nTheir official website lists various events and activities that they participate in throughout the year.
