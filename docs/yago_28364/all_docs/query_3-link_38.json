According Monaco-Matin, via the Palais Princier de Monaco, the king and queen will attend along with H.R.H. Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde of Belgium, T.R.H.s Prince Laurent and Princess Claire, and H.R.H. Princess Astrid.\n\nTo view the updated royal guest-list please click here and scroll down.\n\nAlso, to watch a video about the wedding preparations please click the here. Push the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button and roughly a minute and a half into the program the information about the wedding will begin. If you are having trouble viewing the program, all I can say is sorry. üôÇ Finally, the link will most likely air the princely wedding on July 1 and 2 so you might want to bookmark it if you live outside of France and Monaco."
