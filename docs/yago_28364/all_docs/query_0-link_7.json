        "text": "About 20 years ago, when Mario Danneels started asking questions about King Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium’s marriage, no one in royal circles took him seriously. And for understandable reasons—he was a skinny 16 year old, still in secondary school, claiming to be working on a biography of the Italian-born queen on the eve of her 60th birthday.\n\n“I was always very clear. I was telling people that it was very simple, but very few believed me. They thought that it would result in something for school, but I had a publisher and I told everyone that,” Danneels told Vanity Fair on Tuesday—hours after the royal sex scandal he reported two decades ago concluded in unprecedented fashion. On Monday, after a seven-year legal battle that involved a Jerry Springer-like-DNA-test debacle (more on that later), Albert II acknowledged that 51-year-old artist Delphine Boël is his daughter, resulting from a reportedly 18-year affair he had with Belgian aristocrat Sybille de Selys Longchamps.\n\nBut Danneels had no clue about the long-term infidelity when he began ringing up Belgians with ties to the royal family. Because of his age, Danneels said, “I got talking to people who normally never would have talked to a journalist—for example, the private priests of the king and queen who would actually go to the royal palace to say mass. They just saw me as a cute little boy, I suppose, who admired the queen. I got access to all these people journalists and authors wouldn’t have gotten access to. A lot of people told me too much as well as a result.”\n\nGrowing up, Danneels was fascinated by the royals—in particular Paola. Born into Italian nobility, Paola was heralded as one of Europe’s leading beauties. She met her future husband—then the Prince of Liège—at age 21 in 1958, at a reception for the coronation of Pope John XXIII. They were married eight months later.\n\n“She was really famous in Europe in the ’60s and ’70s because she was drop-dead gorgeous—as beautiful as Grace Kelly—and she was followed by the paparazzi everywhere,” Danneels explained. The son of a roofer and a stay-at-home mom, Danneels was also obsessed with writing—so much so that, at age 15, he began volunteering to pen pieces for the street paper the Big Issue. Royal news was his beat and—as Queen Paola’s birthday approached—he wondered why no one had really written at length about the monarch he viewed as a bit of an enigma.\n\n“She was this glamorous, gorgeous princess who had become quite a dull queen,” Danneels said. “She was very shy and was not very outgoing and not very popular as a result.” He had an inkling—as did much of Belgium—that there had been a serious impasse in Albert and Paola’s marriage.\n\nFor years, after having three children together, Albert and Paola lived separate lives—even reportedly occupying different wings of Belvédère Castle. And the couple allegedly discussed divorcing—though Albert’s older brother, King Baudouin, is said to have threatened Paola—saying that if she were to go through with the paperwork, she would lose her and Albert’s children, her title, and her allowance.\n\n“Everyone in Belgium knew that there had been a crisis in the marriage,” Danneels said. “That, in the ’70s, they were on the brink of divorce, but nobody knew the reason.”\n\nWhile investigating Paola, Danneels decided that the queen deserved a full book. And, after assembling two chapters of an unauthorized biography after finishing his homework each night, Danneels was able to secure a publisher—and keep trying to solve the mystery of Albert and Paola’s marriage.\n\n“I kept asking people that I was interviewing. They were all tiptoeing around the topic and they were very careful to put the emphasis on the fact that they had reconciled. So I was becoming a bit frustrated. Like, ‘Something must have happened, something big.’”\n\nAfter speaking to over 40 people close to the royals, Danneels was no closer to the answer. Fortunately, his publisher had a royal connection—and arranged an off-the-record meeting between Danneels and a person who had worked in Albert and Paola’s court.\n\n“I said, ‘I have a lot of information and I’ve had really good sources, but nobody wants to tell me why exactly Albert and Paola were ready to divorce.’”\n\nThe former courtier’s casual response stunned him: “Everyone knows Albert has a daughter with another woman.”\n\n“My publisher and I looked at each other and I was like, ‘No, nobody knows.’ I just started ringing people whom I had met, whom I had interviewed, and asked them straight out, ‘Is this true?’ And they said, ‘Look, we didn’t want to tell you and we don’t particularly want this information to get out but we won’t lie to you either, we won’t deny it.’ So I knew it was true after a number of people had not even explicitly confirmed this, but nobody denied it.”\n\nLooking back now, Danneels traced the origins of the fractured marriage—chalking the first cracks up to differences in personality and culture, and the confining reality of royal life.\n\n“Queen Paola was very unhappy at the court. I visited the town where she’s from in Italy and it’s always sunny, beautiful—and the food is much better than it is in Belgium. And she was very young, 21 when she got married to Albert and moved to Brussels. The king and queen [King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola] at the time were extremely religious and court life was very somber and very solemn and it just didn’t suit her. So the marriage started crumbling as a result and when Albert met Delphine’s mother, she was having trouble in her marriage and they found comfort with each other. They bonded over their failing marriages basically.”\n\nDanneels had lengthy conversations with his publisher about how to delicately weave this bombshell into his biography without making it sensational.\n\n“The focus of the book really had to be Queen Paola,” Danneels said. “I really wanted the focus to remain on her but I also wanted to the reader to understand what she has been through, and her husband’s having a child with another woman is a pretty big thing.… The fact that Albert had an affair for as long as he did—18 years he was together with Delphine’s mother. Obviously that’s going to have a huge impact on anyone, especially if they can’t get a divorce because they are trapped within the Royal confines. It explains a lot about who she is and and who she has become as a result.”\n\nAfter long deliberations with the publisher, Danneels decided to allude to the affair and child in a single sentence. “It was even a bit cryptic, but it was enough to unleash what it did.”\n\nWithin hours of the 1999 launch of Danneels’s book, Paola, the 18-year-old author was besieged by press requests. He was also devastated—because he spent two years researching and writing about Paola in an attempt to bring recognition to Belgium’s enigmatic queen. And all the news outlets seemed to be reporting on was Albert’s illegitimate daughter, whom reporters identified almost immediately.\n\n“She was an open secret with the Belgian media,” Danneels explained. “But no one there was [willing] to report it. So as soon as the book came out, it was open season. They knew who she was, they knew where she was living, and my book was the excuse that they needed to go all out on this.… The next day it was in the British paper The Times—the headline was: ‘Love Child of Belgian King Living in London,’ and a huge picture of Delphine on the front cover.… At the book launch, nobody was talking about the queen. All the questions were about the affair, Delphine, and Albert’s infidelity. Straight away I was getting phone calls from reporters in Belgium’s neighboring countries like Germany, France—and then I started getting phone calls from further afield. My brother [called] from Ireland saying, ‘What have you done?’”\n\nThe media attention was so intense that, later that year, Albert made reference to the allegation and admitted to a “crisis” in his marriage during his Christmas address.\n\n“The queen and I have thought of the crisis that we went through, now 30 years ago,” Albert said. “This crisis was highlighted recently. We wish not to go into this much deeper, it’s part of our private life.” The remark was interpreted as acknowledgment of his extramarital affair.\n\nBoël and her mother refused to comment on the report at the time, but the artist gave an interview six years later claiming that she was indeed Albert’s daughter. According to a book by Boël, Albert maintained contact with Longchamps during Boël’s childhood and—when Boël was three—told Longchamps he wanted to divorce Paola and move to London to be with them. Boël said that her mother had talked the then prince out of making such a politically disastrous decision. After the publication of Paola, Boël said she reached out to Albert to ask for protection for her mother from the journalists harassing her. He allegedly replied, “Leave me alone with that story. You are not my daughter.”\n\nAccording to Danneels, “She became enraged when she had her own children. She was like, ‘How could a parent do this to their own flesh and blood?’ So she developed this drive for justice and in that respect I’m very proud of her and thrilled at what she has achieved.” Danneels pointed out that Boël was raised by Belgian industrialist Jacques Boël, whose family is reportedly worth about $1 billion—“far, far more than what Albert is worth.… Delphine’s not doing this for financial gain.”\n\nIn 2013, the year that Albert abdicated the throne to his son—losing his immunity from prosecution—Boël filed a lawsuit seeking recognition as Albert’s biological daughter. The same year, a Belgian TV program aired an interview with Boël’s mother during which she bolstered her daughter’s claims by recalling her romantic relationship with Albert.\n\n“From the start I felt that we were not indifferent to each other,” Longchamps said of meeting Albert in Greece. She also claimed that Albert was not angry when she became pregnant, and even sent her flowers after Boël’s birth. “It was a beautiful period,” she said. “Delphine was a love child. Albert was not the father figure, but he was very sweet to her.”\n\nIn 2018, Albert was ordered in a court ruling to submit for a DNA test. Six months later, after he failed to comply, a Brussels court threatened to fine Albert 5,000 euros each day he did not take the test. Rather than cause a royal crisis by ignoring the order, Albert submitted his DNA, and released the results on Monday.\n\nBut his acknowledgment of his daughter, 51 years after her birth, was notably cold. In a statement, the king’s lawyers said Albert had “never been involved with any family, social or educative decision whatsoever regarding Madame Delphine Boël.” The lawyers also accused Boël of deciding to “change families” through a “long” and “painful” lawsuit. Boël’s lawyers admitted that the phrasing did not suggest Albert wanted a relationship with his daughter. “For her part, she is open to this dialogue,” Boël’s lawyer said, “but without much hope.”\n\nEven though Boël may not get a relationship with her father, the acknowledgement, according to Danneels, will give Boël “peace of mind and justice for her children. That was extremely important to her—that her children wouldn’t have to live with the stigma that she has been living with for 51 years. I should even comment that she’s the lucky one compared to her half brothers and half sister because she has freedom to do what she wants. I mean, she doesn’t want to be a princess, not at all. She has absolutely no interest in waving at people from the balcony or wearing the title.”\n\nDanneels was still processing what Monday’s ruling meant for him. Five years after the publication of Paola, he relocated to Ireland—where he still reports on royals and is currently writing a book on Scientology. “It’s been surreal for me that something I did as an 18-year-old is still being talked about.… I’m 38. More than half of my life I’ve been talking about this and I genuinely do think it’ll come to a close. It’ll be strange and I just hope I can move on from it and focus on something else and actually achieve other things. It’s a new chapter for me as well.”\n\nBy Monday evening, Albert and Boël had both acknowledged the apparent conclusion to this long, painful legal battle. But one affected party was still glaringly silent on the matter: Paola.\n\nFor her 70th birthday in 2007, the reclusive queen gave an interview alluding to the marital scandal being in the rearview mirror. “We’ve had our problems,” she was quoted as saying about her and her husband, “but now we both say that we were meant for each other. We are very happy now.”\n\nAs for what Paola thought of her unauthorized biography—the one Danneels wrote in hopes of garnering sympathy for the queen—the author doesn’t know exactly. But, a while back, he did hear from someone who had talked to Paola’s private secretary about the book.\n\nThat secondhand review? “She didn’t rip it up,” laughed Danneels. “Which I thought was funny.”"
