        "text": "Relationships of the Belgian Royal Women\n\nHave I heard that the most senior Royal Belgium Women do not get along? Seems like I read somewhere that Queen Fabiola doesn't get along with/or like Queen Paola. And Queen Paola doesn't like/or get along with Crown Princess Mathilde. I know we are not supposed to \"guess\" on these forums. But if it is \"common knowledge\", or has been published would that be guessing? I think it is sad if these women do not like each other. Can someone help me with this?\n\nI'm sorry, but I honestly think it's just speculation...\n\nIt's like all the royal houses, we heard that too about the Spanish royal house from the Queen, Letizia, Cristina and Elena, etc...\n\nBut publicly, there are reasons for thinking that?\n\nI believe, they must be a family like any other. If something happens between them, I think is natural.\n\nWell, I really hope not, because I really like this royal family...\n\nmrsbugman, for what it is worth I don't think your questions are at all disrespectful.\n\nThere is a lot more info on the relationships between the Belgian Royal women in the various family threads here...particularly fascinating is the information that deals with the deep antagonism between Princess Marie-Christine and her late mother Liliane, Princess de Rethy...as well as some early tension between Queen Fabiola and her husband's stepmother(again, Princess Liliane)\n\nI am sad about this new thread which is only speculation and unrespectiful !\n\nThe subject raised in the opening post of this thread is neither speculative nor disrespectful. The member was asking a question, and a valid one at that. For example, it is no secret that for a period of time the marriage of the then Prince and Princess of Liege was under severe stress.\n\nIt is therefore not an unreasonable conclusion to draw that the very conservative, staid and devout Catholic Queen (Fabiola) was none too impressed at the behaviour of her somewhat racy Italian sister-in-law (Paola). They may well have a \"perfect\" relationship today, but that does not mean it was always so.\n\nTRF is a discussion forum and legitimate topics of discussion are welcomed.\n\nMembers' sense of loyalty to their own Reigning Houses is admirable but should not blind them to life's realities.\n\nthanks,\n\nWarren\n\nAdministrator\n\nI'd insert into the discussion also their three sisters-in-law, the late Grand Duchess Josephine Charlotte of Luxembourg, Princess Marie Esmeralda and Lea (Princess Alexandre).\n\nIn particular I'm curious to know what are (were, in Josephine-Charlotte's case) the relationships between the three elderly women (JC, Fabiola and Paola) with the youngers (Esmeralda and Lea; I don't care of Marie Christine becasuse it's well known that she has horrible relationships with the whole Royal Family), who given their ages could be their daughters.\n\nThe subject raised in the opening post of this thread is neither speculative nor disrespectful.

How much of it was based on facts and how much based on gossip is unclear. But more respectable magazines than the tabloids have written about it over the years.\n\nI suppose rumours about Paola and Fabiola were likely to start since they both entered the Belgian RF more or less at the same time and while both were so very different. The tragic, catholic queen vs. the party princess.\n\nAnyway, according to the Belgian press it was Paola who forced Fabiola out of Laeken palace quickly after Baudouin's death (a variation on Lilian removing all the furniture from Laeken when Fabiola and Baudouin came back from their honeymoon perhaps?). And I believe the HUMO articles on Fabiola refer to the bad relationship between the two as well. They even claimed that princess Mathilde was told by the court to have less contact with Fabiola and spend more time with her mother-in-law. Of course, these are all rumours and it is very difficult to verify, but the question about their relationship is legitimate indeed and it has been discussed at various times in the press for decades.\n\nBut it's her present, why can't she let someone else wear? It belongs to Fabiola and she could let a homeless person wear it if she wanted.\n\nI do understand what your saying that it was a gift and might have sentimental value, but the majority of tiaras in every royal families were once a gift to someone."
