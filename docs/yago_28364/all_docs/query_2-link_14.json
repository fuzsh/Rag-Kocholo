        "text": "http://news.bbc.co.uk\n\nWorld: Europe\n\nBelgium's royal sex scandal\n\nBy Oana Lungescu in Brussels\n\nRevelations that Belgium's King Albert II may have a 31-year-old illegitimate daughter have created a stir - but more because of the intrusion into the royal family's life by the typically-discreet media, than the king's alleged adultery.\n\n\"This is an earthquake for the royalty. For the first time in our history, the Belgian media have looked through the keyhole of the royal palace,\" wrote one newspaper editor, almost apologising for the three pages of detailed articles on the allegations.\n\nA spokeswoman for the royal palace declined to comment on what she called \"malevolent gossip\".\n\nAnother newspaper defended its own break with the tradition of discretion by pointing the finger at the extensive television coverage given to the story.\n\nThe paper then proceeded to reveal the address of the king's alleged illegitimate daughter, Delphine Boel, an artist living in London's Portobello Road.\n\nIt also shows pictures - also accessible on her website - of her vividly-coloured papier mache sculptures, including a cow wearing a little crown.\n\n\"Perhaps an ironic reference from the girl who could have been a princess?\" the paper asks.\n\n'No comment'\n\nDelphine's mother, Belgian aristocrat Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, who married a well-known industrialist after her birth, has refused to comment on the rumours.\n\nMs Boel - splashed across the front page of UK newspaper The Times on Friday - also refused to comment.\n\nShe could never succeed to the throne because the Belgian constitution states that the crown must pass to a legitimate descendant.\n\nStory re-surfaced\n\nThe story appeared two years ago in a Belgian satirical magazine, but it has re-emerged under bizarre circumstances in a forthcoming biography of the Belgian Queen Paola.\n\nIts author turns out to be an 18-year-old Flemish schoolboy, Mario Daneels, who calls himself a historian.\n\nSome have speculated that the rumours might have been brought to the fore by supporters of Flemish independence in order to embarrass the monarchy - a symbol of Belgian statehood - as it prepares for the long-awaited marriage of the king's heir, Prince Philippe, aged 40.\n\nOthers recall the case of Mazarine, the illegitimate daughter that the French President Francois Mitterand acknowledged as his own before he died.\n\nBut for many, this is less about the monarchy than about the Belgian media which, in the wake of so many scandals, has now shed its last taboo.\n\nOriginally posted by sky+Sep 3rd, 2003 - 8:50 am--></span><table border='0' align='center' width='95%' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='1'><tr><td>QUOTE (sky @ Sep 3rd, 2003 - 8:50 am)</td></tr><tr><td id='QUOTE'> <!--QuoteBegin--moosey60@Sep 2nd, 2003 - 9:12 pm\n\nIllegitimate child? Has he accepted her? I see, well congratulations to Bertie on four grandkids from 2003-early 2004. She is a very pretty lady.\n\nwell, i dont know if he has accepted , but i think he did because , i would'nt admitted to a child to the public and not keep in contact. [/b][/quote]\n\ni believe the author of the book who talked about Delphine for the first time , said that she did come to Belvédère(where albert and paola live) when she was a child.\n\nhe also said that paola had a rough time it (which is pretty normal i think)\n\nDelphine was conceived a few years after the birth of Prince Laurent. The marriage of the Prince & Princess of Liège (as was their title when Baudouin was King) cooled down...for many years I believe. Both spouses had their share of affairs...But in the late 70-ties the couple grew back together...and it has been a very harmonious marriage from that time on. I believe that especially their daughter Princess Astrid (married to Archduke Lorenz) made this happen. The relations between the Lièges and the (pious) King and Queen (who did not allow a divorce..& in the 70-ties there were rumours that the King & Queen wanted to take over guardianship over the 3 children, especially Phillipe) from then on fastly improved...especially because Albert & Paola became more pious as well. I think that the last years the couple has become very close...which really shows. Remember the affectionate kiss & hug that the queen gave her husband in public (on stage even) during his jubilee celebrations?\n\nDelphine....well...although she seems to be in touch with the royal family she made some nasty comments about QQueen Paola a few months ago which were published! She said that Paola was a bad mother & that especially her sons were ill-suited for life in the real world & still very dependant on her. Another nasty remark about the Queen was that Delphine thought that the Queen had no real affection or knowledge of art, she just pretends to be interested (to look clever?)...Delphine is an artist so maybe Paola did not like her work, which caused some jealousy in Delphine???\n\nOriginally posted by Lalla Meriem@Jun 9th, 2004 - 12:24 am\n\nMs. Boel is very close to her siblings. She was acknowledged unoffically by the King several years ago in an interview (or speech of some sort). She was with him often as a child.\n\nNo that's not true.\n\nIn his new year's speech (2000), king Albert said that 'queen Paola and he had been reminded of the crisis that their marriage went through more then 30 years ago. They have managed to surmount that crisis and they hope, that it can give hope to other couple who have problems.' and then he said 'the rest belongs to our private life'.\n\nSo it was no official recognition. And there's no need for that either. It was no state affair, it was, like ha said, something private that happened long before he became king."
