        "text": "Either or?\n\nAs of yesterday, 1st October 2020, Belgium has not only one new Princess, but two and a new Prince.\n\nA DNA test forced King Albert II to admit he was the biological father of Delphine Boël earlier in the year, having had a long-term affair with Ms Boël's mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps. Rumour had started after a disclosure in an unauthorised biography of Albert's wife, Queen Paola, and Ms. Boël fought her paternity claim for more than a decade. However, it was not until Albert abdicated in 2013 - when he lost his immunity to prosecution - that she opened court proceedings to grant her the same rights and titles as her father's children by his marriage. To cut a long story short, the Belgian Court found in Ms Boël's favour yesterday.\n\nMs Delphine Boël now Princess Delphine of Saxe-Cobourg, Princess of Belgium. Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/EPA\n\nUnder the court ruling, the artist has the surname 'of Saxe-Cobourg' and was granted the title of Princess of Belgium. This applies by court ruling to her two children who are now called ​Princess Joséphine of Belgium, O'Hare and Prince Oscar of Belgium, O'Hare, respectively. It is not entirely clear whether they are Royal Highnesses yet, especially as King Albert has the right to appeal.\n\nWhat is also not clear is the implication of the court ruling on their Coats of Arms. The Shield of Jacques Boël, up to yesterday her legal father, is shown here and is blazonned as follows:\n\nOr a Tower decorated and crenellated sable masoned argent, on a Chief azure three Mallets Or bendwise in Fess.\n\nAs Princess of Belgium Delphine will surely be entitled to a Coat of Arms in accordance with the Royal Decree which was signed by King Albert's son and successor HM King Philippe on 12th July last year and published on 19 July. (Royal Decree published on 19 July and signed on 12 July 2019)\n\nPrincesses are entitled to the Royal Arms on a Lozenge-shaped Shield with Supporters, Pavilion, Crowns and Motto. However, there are two versions - one with a yellow border and one with a purple border - as shown at the top.\n\nShield of the Coat of Arms of the Boël family. Source: Wikipedia/Mimich/euraldic.com"
