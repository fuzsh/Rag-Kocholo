        "text": "Queen Paola and King Albert have spoken openly of how their marriage survived despite them beginning negotiations to divorice.\n\nIn a new TV programme focussed on Paola, the couple reveal that lawyers were already drawing up terms for them to part when they decided to give their marriage another go. And they both confess that their tumultuous relationship had a big impact on their three children, including King Philippe of the Belgians.\n\nThe revelations come in RTBF’s Paola, Cote Jardin which is broadcast in Belgium for the first time on February 18 2022.In it, both confess that they were unhappy for a long time with the 1970s being a particularly difficult period in their marriage. At the time, Albert was heir to the Belgian throne and the couple had the titles of Prince and Princess of Liege. But they had also become tabloid fodder with allegations of infidelity following them both. At that point, lawyers began to work out how they would part.\n\nAlbert tells the programme that the couple’s legal teams were preparing details of their divorce which would see Paola lose custody of their three children. He says ”I did not accept that, children belong with their mother, that was my first reaction.” He adds that things began to change, saying ”Eventually we got to the bizarre situation where the two of us colluded against our lawyers.”\n\nNeither Albert nor Paola mentions his relationship with Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps or the daughter born during their time together who is now Princess Delphine of Belgium. Paola does refer to a photo published showing her with another man who has his hand around her waist. ”That was a selfish love,” she tells the programme, adding ”in another life, I wouldn’t do it again.”\n\nThe couple, both now in their eighties. admit that their three children suffered as a result of their unhappiness. Paola says ”I understand now how important it is to give affection to your children but I didn’t know any better.”\n\nAnd Albert and Paola’s eldest child, King Philippe of the Belgians, also speaks to the show. Looking at family photos with his mother, the Belgian Monarch says ”as children, we witnessed difficult moments….we have all suffered greatly.” But he has praise for his parents, telling them ”today, you are happy…that doesn’t happen automatically..that reconciliation and forgiveness is the hardest thing there is….but I am convinced you have always loved each other.”\n\nPaola, Cote Jardin is shown on RTBF on February 18th 2022."
