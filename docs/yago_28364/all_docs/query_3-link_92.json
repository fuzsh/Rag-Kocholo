        "text": "Early life and family background\n\nShe was born in Forte dei Marmi, Tuscany, Italy, the seventh and youngest child of the World War I Italian flying ace Fulco, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda (1884–1946). Her mother was Luisa Gazelli dei Conti di Rossana e di Sebastiano (1896–1989), a matrilineal descendant of the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution. She is of Italian and Belgian ancestry and was hailed as one of the leading beauties of Europe in her youth.\n\nQueen Paola is fluent in Italian, French, German and English. Less fluent, and the cause of occasional criticism, is her Dutch, the mother tongue of nearly 60 percent of Belgians.\n\nAdemarus Rufus, who died in 1049, held the title of Comes in southern Italy and Siggerio Ruffo became Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II's grand marshal of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1235. The family divided into two branches after the 14th century: the Ruffo di Calabria and the Ruffo di Scaletta, to the former of which the Queen belongs.\n\nQueen Paola's brother, Don Fabrizio Ruffo di Calabria-Santipau (1922–2005), head of the entire family from 1975, was historical heir to the titles of Prince of Scilla, Prince of Palazzolo, Duke of Guardia Lombarda, Count of Sinopoli, Marquis of Licodia Eubea, Count of Nicotera, Baron of Calanna and of Crispano, Patrician of Naples.\n\nQueen Paola is related to historically eminent Roman and southern Italian noble families, including the Colonna, Orsini, Pallavicini, Alliata and Rospigliosi. Among her distinguished ancestors of the French aristocracy were the American general Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette and the Dukes of Noailles.\n\nSince the fall of the Italian monarchy in 1946, the Princes Ruffo di Calabria have become connected by marriage, in addition to the Belgian royal family, to such formerly reigning dynasties as the Orléans, the Savoys and the Bonapartes.\n\nMarriage and family\n\nIn 1958, the Prince of Liège went to the Vatican to witness the coronation of Pope John XXIII. At a reception at the Belgian embassy, the Prince met Italian Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria. \"We were both shy, so we only talked a little,\" Paola said later about their first meeting. Shy but smitten, Prince Albert later proposed marriage to Paola, and she accepted. Their engagement was announced at the Chateau of Laeken in 1959.\n\nThe Royal Household wanted to organise the wedding in the Vatican, and to have it blessed by Pope John XXIII. Albert's father, King Leopold III of the Belgians, his aunt ex-Queen Marie-José of Italy, and Paola's brother, the Prince Ruffo, sent a diplomatic mission to the pontifical court. However the Belgian Government never accepted, and objected to the wish of the court. The Pope understood the government's concerns, and never agreed to participate in the wedding. Finally, avoiding an international scandal, the Prince of Liège married Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria at St. Goedele Cathedral in Brussels on 2 July 1959.\n\nIssue\n\nThe couple have three children:\n\nPhilippe, King of the Belgians (b. 15 April 1960), who married Countess Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz in 1999 and has 4 children.\n\nPrincess Astrid (b. 5 June 1962), who married Lorenz, Archduke of Austria-Este in 1984 and has 5 children.\n\nPrince Laurent (b. 19 October 1963), who married Claire Louise Coombs in 2003 and has 3 children.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the marriage had deteriorated, and there were rumors of divorce plans. By the early 1980s, however, the couple had reconciled. In the end, Albert and Paola chose to stay together.\n\nFor her 70th birthday interview, Paola, by then Queen of the Belgians, said, \"we've had our problems, but now we both say that we were meant for each other. We are very happy now.\" On May 17, 2016 Paola became a great-grandmother to Archduchess Anna Astrid, the daughter of her eldest grandchild, Prince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este.\n\nHealth\n\nIn 2015, the court announced Queen Paola was taking \"a period of total rest\" following doctors orders. They also announced that she had to cancel a planned visit to the Biennale in Venice. Further communications were kept private. The queen sent a message to Grosio, where she was expected to visit the residence of her aunt the Marquesa Margherita Pallavicini Mossi. Newspapers believed that the queen suffered from a stroke during the holiday. The palace later announced Queen Paola was being treated for a Cardiac Arrhythmia.\n\nIn December 2016 & February 2017, she was hospitalized with fractures after suffering a fall.\n\nContemporary Belgian art\n\nQueen Paola has demonstrated interest in contemporary Belgian arts, visiting the Venetian Biennale several times. She has acquired works of Jan Fabre, Michael Borremans and others for the Royal collection. She has often met with such artists as Luc Tuymans and Dirk Braeckman.\n\nTitles\n\n11 September 1937 – 2 July 1959: Donna Paola Margherita Maria Antonia Consiglia Ruffo di Calabria\n\n2 July 1959 – 9 August 1993: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Liège\n\n9 August 1993 – 21 July 2013: Her Majesty The Queen of the Belgians\n\n21 July 2013 – present: Her Majesty Queen Paola\n\nNational honours\n\nItaly: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic\n\nVatican: Dame Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre\n\nHoly See: Dame of the Decoration of Honour\n\nSovereign Military Order of Malta: Dame Grand Cross of Obedience of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, 1st Class\n\nBelgium: Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold in 1994.\n\nForeign honours\n\nAustria: Grand Star of the Order for Services to the Republic of Austria\n\nBulgaria: Grand Cross of the Order of the Balkan Mountains\n\nDenmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant\n\nEstonia: 1st Class of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana\n\nFinland: Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose\n\nGermany: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, Special Issue\n\nJapan: Paulownia Dame Grand Cordon of the Order of the Precious Crown\n\nLatvia: Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Three Stars\n\nLithuania: Grand Cross of the Order of Vytautas the Great\n\nLuxembourg: Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau\n\nMorocco: Dame with Collar of the Order of Muhammad\n\nNetherlands: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion\n\nNetherlands: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the House of Orange\n\nNetherlands: Recipient of the Wedding Medal of Princess Beatrix, Princess of Orange and Claus Van Amsberg\n\nNorway: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav\n\nPoland: Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle\n\nPortugal: Grand Cross of the Order of Christ\n\nRomania: Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania\n\nSweden: Member Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Seraphim"
