        "text": "The former king of Belgium, King Albert II, was admitted to a hospital in Brussels on Tuesday. Upon his admittance, palace spokesman Xavier Baert said the 89-year-old former king \"showed signs of dehydration and was admitted to hospital as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nAfter he was admitted to the Saint-Luc Hospital, his son King Philippe canceled an engagement and went to visit, along with his wife, Queen Mathilde. Prince Laurent, Albert's second son, and Prince Emmanuel, his grandson, were also pictured visiting the hospital.\n\nNow, the Palace has a health update: Albert will remain in the hospital through the weekend, and possibly early next week. Baert shared that his additional time in the hospital is \"no cause for concern. King Albert is doing well, but he is tired. On doctor's advice, he must take time to recuperate properly.\" The hospital is limiting visitors, and only his wife, Queen Paola, was permitted to sit with him, according to royal correspondent Wim Dehandschutter.\n\nIn 2013, King Albert II abdicated the throne in favor of his eldest son, Philippe. \"I realise that my age and my health are no longer allowing me to carry out my duties as I would like to,\" he said at the time. \"Prince Philippe is well prepared to succeed me.\" He also abdicated amidst drama surrounding an illegitimate daughter, Delphine, who wanted to be legally recognized (which she achieved in October 2020, and is now Princess Delphine).\n\nNow, King Albert and his wife, Queen Paola, make few public appearances. They recently appeared at a ceremony for the Queen Paola Prize for teachers, and at a ceremony at the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel in Waterloo, Belgium.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
