Albert was the second son of the former King Leopold III of the Belgians and the younger brother of King Baudouin of the Belgians. Both Paola and Albert attended a reception at the Belgian Embassy where they were introduced. The following year, their engagement was announced.\n\nAfter briefly considering holding the wedding at the Vatican, the government stepped in and insisted that they marry in Belgium. The wedding was held on July 2, 1959, at St. Michael and St. Gulda Cathedral in Brussels, Belgium. Upon marriage, Paola became a Princess of Belgium and was styled Princess of Liège.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of King Albert II of Belgium and Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria\n\nPaola and Albert had three children:\n\nPhilippe, King of the Belgians (born 1960), married Mathilde d’Udekem d’Acoz, had four children\n\nPrincess Astrid of Belgium (born 1962), married Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este, had five children\n\nPrince Laurent of Belgium (born 1963), married Claire Coombs, had three children\n\nOn July 31, 1993, Albert’s brother, King Baudouin, passed away suddenly at his holiday home in Portugal. Albert succeeded to the throne, and Paola became Queen of the Belgians. As Queen, Paola worked closely with The Queen’s Charities to promote her involvement in social projects and assisting those in need throughout Belgium. She later established the Queen Paola Foundation which focuses on youth and education, particularly for those in disadvantaged areas. In addition, Queen Paola has been very involved in the areas of art and music.\n\nOn July 21, 2013, after nearly 30 years on the throne, King Albert II abdicated in favor of their eldest son, Philippe. The couple continues to reside at Chateau Belvedere, located within the Royal Park at Laeken, Brussels, Belgium. King Albert and Queen Paola have remained largely out of the public eye, preferring to live a more quiet retirement, enjoying time with their children and twelve grandchildren.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
