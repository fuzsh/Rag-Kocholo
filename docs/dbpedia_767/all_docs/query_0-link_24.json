Two new synonyms are proposed: Coptoborus Hopkins, 1915 (= Theoborus Hopkins, 1915 syn. nov.) and Coptoborus villosulus (Blandford, 1898) (= Theoborus theobromae Hopkins, 1915 syn. nov.). Xyleborus neosphenos Schedl, 1976 comb. res. is removed from Coptoborus. The revised genus now contains 77 species and a key to their identification is provided.\n\nKeywords: Ambrosia beetles, cacao, Neotropical, Theoborus\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe diversity of Neotropical scolytine beetles is largely undescribed. Estimates of the Ecuadorian and Peruvian faunas suggest that the fauna is ~3–4 times greater than currently known (Smith et al. 2017; Dole et al. 2021) and recent taxonomic reviews have revealed several new genera and new species (e.g. Dole and Cognato 2007; Petrov and Mandelshtam 2009; Smith and Cognato 2010; Petrov and Mandelshtam 2010; Petrov 2014; Smith 2017; Atkinson 2018; Cognato 2018; Petrov and Mandelshtam 2018; Bright 2019; Atkinson 2020; Jordal and Smith 2020; Pérez Silva et al. 2020). The Xyleborini ambrosia beetles have a worldwide diversity of at least 1200 species but have received limited attention in the Neotropics, the region where most of the scolytine diversity lies (Hulcr et al. 2015). In the last major reviews of the Central and South American xyleborine faunas, ~175 species have been recorded and more are likely to be discovered (Wood 1982, 2007; Smith et al. 2017). Indeed, the Amazonian canopy is a source of untapped diversity which may yield an additional 40–80% as compared to the currently known fauna (Dole et al. 2021). Diversification into different habitats and the highly inbred nature of xyleborines may explain the radiation of endemic genera and species that occurred after the colonization of the Americas in the past 15 million years (Cognato et al. 2011; Jordal and Cognato 2012; Gohli et al. 2016). Of these ambrosia beetle genera, Coptoborus Hopkins, 1915 and Theoborus Hopkins, 1915 are similar in morphology, closely related and comprise ~30 species (Wood 2007; Cognato et al. 2011). Theoborus coartatus (Sampson, 1921), T. theobromae Hopkins, 1915, T. villosulus (Blandford, 1898), Coptoborus tolimanus (Eggers, 1928), and C. vespatorius (Schedl, 1931) have long been recognized as pests of cacao (Terra 1987) and a newly emerging pest, Coptoborus ochromactonus Smith & Cognato, 2014 (Stilwel et al. 2014) threatens balsa wood production (Stilwel et al. 2014; Castro et al. 2019; Martínez et al. 2020), but otherwise, the remaining species are assumed benign. An accumulation of recently collected specimens and museum loans which represents hand collected material from dispersed Neotropical localities and specimens from the Ecuadorian Amazonian canopy, presents an opportunity to re-examine the generic limits of Coptoborus and Theoborus and to contribute to the knowledge of the alpha diversity of xyleborines.\n\nTaxonomic history\n\nCoptoborus was described for three species, Coptoborus emarginatus Hopkins, 1915, the type of the genus, and two additional species, C. palmeri Hopkins, 1915 and C. terminaliae Hopkins, 1915. Coptoborus emarginatus was described from Guatemala while the other species were described from Indonesia and the Philippines, respectively. Hopkins’s concept of Coptoborus was primarily based on antennal characters, specifically the “five jointed funicle (including pedicle) with the segment 1 [pedicle] large and broad, segment 5 [segment 4] much broader than segment 2 [segment 1]; club short, broader than long, sides subequally rounded, anterior face with two sinuate sutures, posterior face with one broadly procurved subapical suture; anterior margin of pronotum fairly rugose; eyes large, elliptical, emarginate”. Wood (1980) attempted to form a meaningful classification of the Xyleborini and placed the Paleotropical genus Streptocranus Schedl, 1939 in synonymy with Coptoborus. Later, Wood (1982) recognized Coptoborus as a subgenus of Xyleborus. This action led to homonymy with Xyleborus emarginatus Eichhoff, 1878 and the type of Coptoborus, C. emarginatus (Hopkins, 1915) and the latter was given the permanent replacement name Xyleborus vespatorius (Schedl 1931). Wood (1986) considered Coptoborus a valid genus and retained Streptocranus as a junior synonym. Additional species were incorporated into Coptoborus from both the Neotropics and Paleotropics (Wood and Bright 1992). Wood (2007) diagnosed Coptoborus based on “protibia with posterior face flat, metatibia almost never with more than 7 socketed teeth”, “posterior third of elytra attenuate or acuminate, narrowly rounded behind, suture often emarginate, 1 or more interstriae sometimes armed by small denticles, and posterior face of the club with two sutures.” Wood recognized two sutures on the posterior face of the antennal club instead of one subapical suture which is the most notable difference to Hopkins’s concept. The posterior face of the C. vespatorius club has two sutures, but the second is faint and not as prominent as the first. Wood (2007) also described several additional species from the Neotropics. Hulcr et al. (2007) reviewed generic characters in the Xyleborini and found that Streptocranus was not congeneric with Coptoborus and removed it from synonymy. Hulcr (2010) recognized that both C. palmeri and C. teminaliae belonged in Debus Hulcr & Cognato, 2010 as synonyms of Xyleborus emarginatus Eichhoff, 1878. The phylogenetic distinction between Coptoborus and Streptocranus was later confirmed with molecular data (Cognato et al. 2011). Recently, Bright (2019) restricted the concept of Coptoborus to include only the type species, C. vespatorius, which has the elytra deeply sulcate, a distinctly elevated and costate interstriae 3, and each elytron separately rounded and produced. This narrow concept of Coptoborus is not supported by a molecular phylogeny (Cognato et al. 2011).\n\nTheoborus was described by Hopkins (1915) to accommodate a single species, Theoborus theobromae Hopkins, 1915. Like Coptoborus, the concept of Theoborus was also based primarily on the antennal club, “funicle 5-jointed [including pedicle], joint 5 [segment 4] broad, 2 [segment 1] not longer than 3 (segment 2] and 4 [segment 3] together; club broad, with sides equally rounded, anterior and posterior faces each with two sutures; eyes small, elliptical, broadly emarginate.” Unlike Coptoborus, the generic status of Theoborus was never in doubt presumably because the two sutures on the posterior face of the club are much more readily apparent on the type species. Wood (1982) distinguished the genus from other Neotropical Xyleborini genera by the presence of two sutures on the posterior face of the club and the flat posterior face of the protibia. Wood (1982) moved eight species from Xyleborus to Theoborus and additional species were added (Wood and Bright 1992). Wood and Bright (1992) also moved one species from Theoborus to Xyleborus and placed one species in synonymy. Wood (2007) described one additional species and maintained his 1982 diagnosis but added additional characters separating it from Coptoborus in the Xyleborini key including “posterior fourth of elytra comparatively broad, rather broadly rounded behind, suture never emarginate; declivital interstriae 1–3 similar, tubercles minute, if present, body comparatively stout, less than 2.6 × as long as wide”. Most recently Smith et al. (2020) considered the Panamanian species Theoborus molestulus (Wood, 1975b) a synonym of the introduced Asian species Euwallacea perbrevis (Schedl, 1951).\n\nWood’s (1982, 2007) generic concepts are very similar and essentially species are defined as Coptoborus if the body shape is attenuate, acuminate or narrowly rounded and elongate or Theoborus if the body shape is rounded and stout. Xyleborine genera are primarily defined based on characters of the antennal club, protibia, pronotal shape, mycangial tufts and scutellum (Hulcr et al. 2007) rather than overall body shape which has been shown to be convergent (Hulcr et al. 2007; Cognato et al. 2020a; Smith et al. 2020). The striking similarity of the genera questions their taxonomic validity.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nExamined specimens were obtained via canopy fogging, our own field expeditions targeting scolytines and through loans from several institutions. Canopy fogging specimens came from Terry Erwin’s long-term Ecuadorian canopy fogging project in the primary forest in Yasuní National Park at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station and Okone Gare Station located in the lowland Amazonian forest of Orellana province. Sites were sampled twice a year during each of the rainy (May–October) and dry seasons (November – April) and collection methods are detailed in Erwin et al. (2005). Our field collected specimens were obtained from Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana, Panama, and Peru and were collected either by direct excision from their galleries or with panel flight intercept traps, “Petrov FIT”, as detailed by Nikulina et al. (2015). All descriptions, keys and diagnoses are based on females as males are largely unknown, rarely encountered, and not often present without a female of the same species. Specimens were amassed and examined from the following entomological collections:\n\nAPP Alexander V.

Montage images were assembled using Helicon Focus Mac Pro 6.7.1 (Helicon Soft, Kharkov, Ukraine).\n\nSpecimens were examined using Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) MZ6 and MZ16 stereomicroscopes and illuminated with an Ikea Jansjö LED work lamp (Delft, Netherlands). Length was measured from pronotum apex to the apex of the declivity, width was measured at the widest point of the pronotum and a maximum of five specimens per species were measured. Measurements were taken of specimens measured and reported by Wood (2007) and these were typically found to be 0.15–0.2 mm shorter than ours, and in the case of C. cuneatus, 0.4–0.5 mm smaller. This calibration error has been noted before as 0.1–0.15 mm for specimens 2.0–3.0 mm (Jordal 1998; L.R. Kirkendall, pers. comm. 9 Dec 2020). To maintain accuracy, specimens that we were unable to directly measure have a citation given for their length. Pedicel is not included in the number of funicle segments. Pronotal (dorsal and lateral) and antennal club types follow those proposed by Hulcr et al. (2007) and further illustrated by Smith et al. (2020).\n\nDistribution and host records were aggregated from the following publications: Atkinson and Equihua Martinez 1985, 1986; Estrada Valencia and Atkinson 1989; Dall’oglio and Peres-Filho 1997; Bright and Skidmore 2002; Wood 2007; Pérez de la Cruz et al. 2009; Atkinson et al. 2010; Bright 2014; Sandoval Rodríguez et al. 2017; Smith et al. 2017; Atkinson 2018; Bright 2019; Del Carmen Gerónimo-Torres et al. 2019; Gomez et al. 2019.

Females disperse to and bore into new host trees to start fungal gardens to feed their offspring (Smith and Hulcr 2015; Kirkendall et al. 2015). Many perish on this journey but those that survive propagate new generations. For millions of years, these intrepid beetles have colonized new lands which led to new lineages and species across the tropics (e.g., Gohli et al 2016; Cognato et al 2018). As a result, the nearly 1200 species exhibit an extraordinary range of morphological diversity. In recognition of these “adventurous” and “unearthly-looking” pioneers, many of the species described herein are named to honor iconic strong female role models of science fiction movies and television. Most of these characters were sources of inspiration for SMS throughout her adolescent life and admiration by AIC.\n\nResults\n\nChecklist\n\nCoptoborus Hopkins\n\nTheoborus Hopkins, syn. nov.\n\nCoptoborus amazonicus (Petrov, 2020) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus amplissimus sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus artetenuis (Schedl, 1973)\n\nCoptoborus asperatus sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus atlanticus (Bright & Torres, 2006) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus attenuatus Wood, 2007\n\nCoptoborus barbicauda sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus bellus (Bright & Torres, 2006) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus bettysmithae sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus brevicauda sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus brigman sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus busoror sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus capillisoror sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus carumbensis Wood, 2007\n\nCoptoborus catulus (Blandford, 1898)\n\nXyleborus intricatus Schedl, 1948\n\nCoptoborus chica sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus coartatus (Sampson, 1921) comb. nov.\n\nXyleborus artecuneolus Schedl, 1939\n\nCoptoborus cracens Wood, 2007\n\nCoptoborus crassisororcula sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus crinitulus (Wood, 1974) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus cuneatus (Eichhoff, 1878)\n\nCoptoborus doliolum sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus erwini sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus exilis (Schedl, 1934) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus exutus (Wood, 1974)\n\nCoptoborus furiosa sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus galacatosae sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus gentilis (Schedl, 1972)\n\nCoptoborus gracilens Wood, 2007\n\nCoptoborus hansen sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus incomptus sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus incultus (Wood, 1975) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus inornatus Wood, 2007\n\nCoptoborus janeway sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus katniss sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus leeloo sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus leia sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus leporinus sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus magnus (Petrov, 2020) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus martinezae sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus micarius (Wood, 1974) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus murinus sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus newt sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus nudulus Wood, 2007\n\nCoptoborus obtusicornis (Schedl, 1976) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus ochromactonus Smith & Cognato, 2014\n\nCoptoborus osbornae sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus panosus sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus papillicauda sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus paurus (Wood, 2007) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus pilisoror sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus pristis (Wood, 1974) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus pseudotenuis (Schedl, 1936) comb. nov.\n\nXyleborus tenuis Schedl, 1948\n\nCoptoborus puertoricensis (Bright & Torres, 2006) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus ricini (Eggers, 1932) comb. nov.\n\nXyleborus solitariceps Schedl, 1954\n\nCoptoborus ripley sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus sagitticauda sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus sarahconnor sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus schulzi Wood, 2007\n\nCoptoborus scully sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus semicostatus (Schedl, 1948) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus sicula sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus silviasilasi Atkinson, 2018\n\nCoptoborus solitariformis (Schedl, 1976)\n\nCoptoborus sororcula sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus spicatus Wood, 2007\n\nCoptoborus starbuck sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus subtilis (Schedl, 1970)\n\nCoptoborus tolimanus (Eggers, 1928)\n\nCoptoborus trinity sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus tristiculus (Wood, 1975) comb. nov.\n\nCoptoborus uhura sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus vasquez sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus vespatorius (Schedl, 1931)\n\nXyleborus emarginatus Hopkins, 1915\n\nXyleborus corniculatus Schedl, 1948\n\nXyleborus corniculatulus Schedl, 1948\n\nCoptoborus villosulus (Blandford, 1898) comb. nov.\n\nTheoborus theobromae Hopkins, 1915 syn. nov.\n\nXyleborus pseudococcotrypes Eggers, 1941\n\nXyleborus coccotrypoides Eggers, 1943\n\nXyleborus villosus Schedl, 1948\n\nXyleborus hirtellus Schedl, 1948\n\nCoptoborus vrataski sp. nov.\n\nCoptoborus yar sp. nov.\n\nRemoved from Coptoborus\n\nXyleborus neosphenos Schedl, 1976 comb. res.\n\nXyleborus neosphenos Schedl, 1976: 76.\n\nCoptoborus neosphenos (Schedl): Wood and Bright 1992: 663.\n\nType material. Holotype (NHMW), examined.\n\nRemarks. This species is removed from Coptoborus because of its incongruent morphology which includes a type 1 antennal club with segment 1 encircling the anterior face, lack of sutures on the posterior face, and very slender protibiae. It is transferred to Xyleborus until additional investigations can correctly place it in a genus.\n\nTaxonomic treatment\n\nCoptoborus\n\nKeywords: Animalia, Coleoptera, Curculionidae\n\nHopkins, 1915\n\n16C83EC5-647E-5FF0-9F72-EC256DB4FFB0\n\nType species.\n\nXyleborus vespatorius Schedl, 1931; original designation.\n\nDiagnosis.\n\nCoptoborus is distinguished from all other Xyleborini genera by the following combination of characters: antennal funicle four-segmented, antennal club type 3, 4 or 2 (typically type 3) with two (rarely three) arcuate sutures visible on the posterior face, club round or longer than wide, posterior face of the protibiae flat and unarmed, both elytral discal striae and interstriae uniseriate punctate, anterior margin of pronotum typically weakly produced with a row of serrations, pronotal disc alutaceous, procoxae contiguous, scutellum small, flush with elytral surface and mycangial tufts absent.\n\nCoptoborus is very similar to Euwallacea Hopkins, 1915, and like Euwallacea, is diagnosed by a combination of homoplastic characters (Smith et al. 2019a, 2020). Both genera have the posterior face of the antennal club with 2 or 3 arcuate sutures near the apex. Euwallacea species typically have a subquadrate or quadrate pronotum (types 3, 4, 8) but some species do have rounded anterior margins like Coptoborus (types 2, 7). All Coptoborus have rounded anterior margins of the pronotum (types 7, 2, 1 or 9) (except C. obtusicornis (type b) which is conspicuously elongate and acuminate frontally), and most have the median area of the pronotum weakly produced and bearing a row of serrations, usually 2–6. Euwallacea species with rounded anterior margins of the pronotum always lack serrations, have semi-circular protibiae with evenly rounded outer edge (except obliquely triangular in E. luctuosus (Eggers, 1939)) and a posterolateral costa that extends to at interstriae 7 (except inconspicuous, short in E. luctuous).\n\nRevised description.\n\nFemale. Length 1.4–3.6 mm and 2.1–4.3 × as long as wide. Body nearly glabrous to densely setose; color variable, light to dark brown, red brown to nearly black; legs and antennae yellow brown to red brown. Appearing very stout to slender, elytra rather variable, appearing round, attenuate, or acuminate. Mycangial tufts absent.\n\nHead: Epistoma entire, transverse, lined with a row of hair-like setae. Frons slightly convex from epistoma to upper level of eyes; surface shagreened, dull, reticulate; punctures small, fine, shallow. Eyes broadly or narrowly emarginate above level of antennal insertion, upper portion of eyes smaller than lower part. Submentum slightly or deeply impressed below genae, narrowly or broadly triangular. Scape short and thick or long and thick, about as long as club. Antennal funicle four-segmented, segments equal in size. Pedicle shorter than funicle or as long as funicle. Club variable, either obliquely truncate, type 2, approximately circular, segment 1 corneous, transverse or weakly convex on anterior face, nearly covering all of posterior face; segment 2 slightly procurved, corneous, visible on anterior and posterior faces of club or club flattened, types 3 or 4 (rarely obliquely truncate and type 2), approximately circular or longer than wide, segment 1 corneous, transverse or sinuate on anterior face, with segments 1, 2, and rarely 3 visible on posterior face. Pronotum: 0.8–1.75 × as long as wide. Pronotum from lateral view typically elongate with disc as long or slightly longer than anterior slope (type 7), taller than basic (type 2), or round (type 1), rarely basic (type 0) or elongate with disc much longer than anterior slope (type 8). In dorsal view typically rounded frontally and long (type 7), basic and parallel-sided (type 2), rarely rounded (type 1) or rounded frontally and very long (type 9) or conspicuously elongate and angulate frontally (type b), anterior margin of pronotum typically weakly produced with a row of 2–6 serrations. Surface alutaceous, anterior slope finely asperate, asperities close, arranged in concentric rings from midpoint of pronotum to anterior and anterolateral areas; disc finely and evenly punctate. Lateral margins variable, obliquely costate, carinate on basal third or along entire length. Posterior angles acutely rounded. Base transverse. Elytra: 1.2–2.5 × as long as wide. Elytral base transverse, margin oblique; humeral angles rounded. Scutellum small to minute, triangular or linguiform, flat, flush with elytra. Elytral shape quite variable, sides straight between basal 42–88%. Disc convex, longer than declivity, rarely as long as declivity. Disc smooth, shiny, finely punctate; striae not impressed, interstrial punctures seriate, or confused (rare). Declivity variable. Posterolateral margin of declivity typically with interstriae 3 and 9 joining, forming a carina and continuing submarginally to apex, but may also be costa, or carinate from suture to interstriae 2, 7, or 8. Legs: Procoxae contiguous. Protibiae obliquely triangular, broadest at apical third, or distinctly triangular, or with evenly rounded outer margin, posterior face flat, unarmed; 5–8 denticles present on outer margin. Meso- and metatibiae obliquely triangular, flattened, posterior face unarmed with 6–12 and 6–11 denticles, respectively.\n\nKey to Coptoborus species (females only) (excluding C. artetenuis)\n\n1Elytral apex broadly rounded, never emarginate (Fig. ) 2 –Elytral apex prolonged apically, attenuate (Fig. ) or acuminate (Fig. ), emarginate in some species (Fig. ) 15 2Posterolateral margin of declivity unarmed by a carina 3 –Posterolateral margin of declivity carinate, carina variable in length from very short and mostly visible to striae 2 or distinct and very long, extending to at least striae 6 6 3Declivity convex, interstriae not impressed;

This species is distinguished by the elytral apex attenuate and weakly emarginate, declivital interstriae 2 convex, declivital interstriae 1–3 unarmed, elytral apex deeply emarginate, and declivity steep, occupying less than posterior 40% of declivity.\n\nSimilar species.\n\nC. exutus, C. galacatosae.\n\nDistribution.\n\nPanama (Panamá), Peru (Huánuco), Venezuela (Barinas).\n\nBiology.\n\nUnknown.\n\nRemarks.\n\nEichhoff (1878) described the species from an unspecified number of specimens. Schedl (1979) apparently presumed that the specimen of X. cuneatus in his collection to be a holotype under the assumption that the species was described from a single specimen. This is not the case, as an additional syntype is in MIIZ along with several other Eichhoff types (Węgrzynowicz and Mokrzecki 1996; Cognato et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019b). Both specimens are therefore syntypes.\n\nThe species was described from specimens collected in Varinas [sic, Barinas], Nova Grenada. The species was listed from Colombia (Wood and Bright 1992; Wood 2007) but we were unable to find specimens definitively from this location (Wood 2007). The type specimens were likely collected from Barinas, Venezuela.\n\nCoptoborus doliolum sp. nov.\n\nKeywords: Animalia, Coleoptera, Curculionidae\n\n1DF14C05-D320-5EAB-A195-114167E1636F\n\nhttp://zoobank.org/F85E24B9-5557-4FC4-AE89-302B124A2A3F\n\nType material.\n\nHolotype, female, Ecuador: Napo Prov.
