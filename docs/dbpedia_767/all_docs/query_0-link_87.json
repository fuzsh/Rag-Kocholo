Introduction\n\n1. Special procedures are mandated by the Human Rights Council to report to it on their activities (see Appendix). 2. In 2009, the sixteenth annual meeting of special procedures mandate holders decided that a joint communications report would be prepared (cf. A/HRC/12/47, para 24-26), with this decision being reconfirmed by the seventeenth annual meeting of special procedures in 2010 in order to avoid duplication, rationalize documentation, allow examination of cross cutting issues and ensure that the content of communications and any follow-up would feed into the universal periodic review mechanism more effectively. Mandate holders decided that the report should contain summaries of communications, and statistical information (A/HRC/15/44, para. 26-27). 3. The Outcome of the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council calls on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain information on special procedures in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner, and encourages the use of modern information technology to reduce the circulation of paper (A/HRC/RES/16/21, Annex, para. 29 and 60). 4. Short summaries of allegations communicated to the respective State or other entity are included in the report, and the communications sent and responses received are accessible electronically through hyperlinks. Communications are reproduced in the language in which they were sent. Replies received in Arabic, Chinese or Russian are included with translations into English, where available.\n\n5. This report covers all urgent appeals, letters of allegations and other letters sent by special procedures mandate holders between 1 June and 30 November 2013 and replies received between 1 August 2013 and 31 January 2014. Communications sent before 1 June 2013 are reported in A/HRC/24/21, A/HRC/23/51, A/HRC/22/67, A/HRC/22/67 corr.1 and corr.2, A/HRC/21/49, A/HRC/20/30, A/HRC/19/44 and A/HRC/18/51 respectively.\n\n6. The report also includes replies received between 1 August 2013 and 31 January 2014, relating to communications sent by special procedures mandate holders before 1 June 2013. Some of these replies supplement information communicated earlier by the respective State.\n\n7. The present report contains urgent appeals sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and joint urgent appeals sent by them together with other mandates. It does not contain other types of communications issued by these mandates, which are processed according to their own distinctive procedures, and are reported in the annual reports of these two working groups.\n\n8. The names of some alleged victims have been obscured in order to protect their privacy and prevent further victimization. Names of victims who would otherwise have their identities protected are mentioned only when the concerned individual has expressly consented or requested to have his or her name in the public report. In the original communications, the full names of the alleged victims were provided to the Government concerned. Names of alleged perpetrators have systematically been darkened in State replies to preserve the presumption of innocence.\n\n9. In preparing the statistics included in this report, uniform reporting periods have been used, reflecting all communications sent between 1 June and 30 November 2013, and responses received in relation to these communications up to 31 January 2014.\n\nCommunications and replies by mandate\n\nReporting period: 1 June to 30 Nov 2013\n\nReporting period: 1 June 2008 to 30 Nov 2013\n\nMandate Communications sent\n\nreplied to by 31 January 2014\n\nresponse rate\n\nCommunications sent\n\nreplied to by 31 January 2014\n\nresponse rate\n\nAdequate housing 9 5 56% 251 113 45%\n\nAfrican descent 1 0 0% 3 2 67%\n\nArbitrary detention 63 32 51% 1,044 559 54%\n\nBelarus 1 1 100% 5 3 60%\n\nBurundi 0 0 0% 6 0 0%\n\nBusiness enterprises 10 6 60% 16 10 62%\n\nCambodia 2 0 0% 18 2 11%\n\nCultural Rights 2 0 0% 18 13 72%\n\nDemocratic and equitable international order 1 0 0% 2 1 50%\n\nDisappearances 25 15 60% 230 91 40%\n\nDiscrimination against women in law and in practice\n\n21 10 48% 50 31 62%\n\nDPR Korea 0 0 0% 6 1 17%\n\nEducation 0 0 0% 62 37 60%\n\nEnvironment 1 0 0% 2 1 50%\n\nExtreme poverty 9 5 56% 28 17 61%\n\nFood 5 3 60% 188 71 38%\n\nForeign debt 3 2 67% 8 5 62%\n\nFreedom of expression 130 60 46% 2,031 1,031 51%\n\nFreedom of peaceful assembly and of association\n\n128 64 50% 476 270 57%\n\nFreedom of religion 16 7 44% 324 181 56%\n\nHaiti 2 0 0% 4 0 0%\n\nHealth 38 25 66% 305 165 54%\n\nHuman rights defenders 127 60 47% 2,295 1,270 55%\n\nIndependence of judges and lawyers 53 19 36% 858 433 51% Indigenous peoples 18 11 61% 278 166 60 %\n\nReporting period: 1 June to 30 Nov 2013\n\nReporting period: 1 June 2008 to 30 Nov 2013\n\nMandate Communications sent\n\nreplied to by 31 January 2014\n\nresponse rate\n\nCommunications sent\n\nreplied to by 31 January 2014\n\nresponse rate\n\nInternally displaced persons 1 1 100% 14 5 36%\n\nIran 15 4 27% 55 19 35%\n\nLiberia 0 0 0% 2 0 0%\n\nMercenaries 3 1 33% 58 20 35%\n\nMigrants 15 10 67% 161 101 63%\n\nMinority issues 15 8 53% 148 82 55%\n\nMyanmar 9 7 78% 84 40 48%\n\nOPT 3 0 0% 16 1 6%\n\nRacism 8 4 50% 87 52 60%\n\nSale of children 1 0 0% 41 16 39%\n\nSlavery 3 2 67% 21 16 76%\n\nSomalia 3 0 0% 10 1 10%\n\nSudan 4 0 0% 18 3 17%\n\nSummary executions 72 25 35% 931 441 47%\n\nTerrorism 14 5 36% 217 94 43%\n\nTorture 106 54 51% 1,632 844 52%\n\nToxic waste 0 0 0% 32 19 60%\n\nTrafficking 1 1 100% 57 35 61%\n\nTruth, justice, reparation & guarantees on non-rec\n\n3 1 33% 11 3 27%\n\nViolence against women 32 18 56% 395 211 53%\n\nWater and Sanitation 8 5 62% 35 22 63%\n\n(*) mandate terminated; (**) mandate re-established in June 2012.

According to the information received, on 30 May 2013, police in Mato Grosso do Sul engaged in a forcible eviction of approximately 1000 indigenous Terena people who for two weeks had occupied a piece of land in the locality of Buriti, officially titled to a private landowner. The land in question is located in an area that the Ministry of Justice had reportedly determined to be indigenous territory. One Terena indigenous man, Mr Oziel Gabriel, was allegedly killed by police gunfire, several others were wounded and ten indigenous people were arrested. Allegations have also been received about the imminent eviction of approximately 150-170 indigenous Kayapo, Arara, Munduruku and Xipaia persons who, since 27 May 2013, had occupied one of the construction sites of the Belo Monte dam in the state of Pará.\n\n16/09/2013\n\nA /H\n\nR C\n\n/25/74\n\n10\n\nDate Type\n\nCase No\n\nCountry Mandate(s) Summary of the allegation transmitted Reply\n\n03/06/2013 JUA\n\nMYS 4/2013 Malaysia\n\nFreedom of expression; Freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; Human rights defenders;\n\nAllegations of harassment and arrest of activists and political leaders participating in demonstrations following the conclusion of the last national elections on 5 May 2013.

On 18 May 2013, student activist Mr Adam Adli was arrested in Kuala Lumpur. On 23 May 2013, he was charged under the Sedition Act 1948, for allegedly uttering a seditious statement during a public forum on 13 May. He was released on bail on the same day, pending a court hearing set for 2 July. A candlelight vigil that was held on 22 May 2013 to call for the release of Mr Adam Adli resulted in the arrest of 18 participants, who were also questioned by the police. On 29 May, authorities allegedly re-arrested opposition Member of the Parliament Mr Tian Chua, opposition PAS Islamic Party member, Mr Tamrin Bin Abdul Ghafar and civil society activist, Mr Haris Ibrahim along with student activist Mr Safwan Anang, under the same Sedition Act in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n03/06/2013 JAL\n\nUSA 5/2013 United States of America\n\nTerrorism; Torture;\n\nAlleged torture and ill-treatment of Mr Shawki Ahmad Sharif Omar by US officials in Iraq. According to the information received, in October 2004, Mr Omar was arrested along with his then pregnant wife by US soldiers in Baghdad in Al Zayouna district. Upon arrest, he was allegedly held incommunicado for two weeks. During interrogation sessions he was allegedly repeatedly subjected to electric shocks and simulations of drowning. He was then reportedly transferred to Camp Cropper (today known as Karkh Prison) and further to Abu Ghraib Prison (reopened as Baghdad Central Prison) with a period of several months of detention in the US army base Camp Bucca close to Umm Qasr in the south of Iraq. It is reported that, while still being held in US-controlled facilities, he was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment for illegal entry into Iraq following an allegedly grossly unfair trial before the Central Criminal Court in Iraq on 24 June 2010. In July2011 Mr Omar was reportedly handed over to the Iraqi authorities and taken to Karkh Prison.\n\nA /H\n\nR C\n\n/25/7411\n\nDate Type\n\nCase No\n\nCountry Mandate(s) Summary of the allegation transmitted Reply\n\n05/06/2013 JUA\n\nIND 6/2013 India\n\nArbitrary detention; Summary executions; Torture;\n\nAlleged risk of imminent execution after proceedings that did not comply with a number of international human rights standards.

Perarivalan alias Arivu and Saibanna Ningappa Natikar were sentenced to death after proceedings which did not comply with international human rights law standards of fair trial and due process guarantees. Furthermore, there are allegations that the aforementioned individuals suffer from serious mental and psychological illnesses due to their prolonged stay on death row in solitary confinement. Messrs. Bhullar, Murugan, Santhan, Perarivalan were reportedly subjected to torture and other ill- treatment. At the time of writing, all aforementioned individuals remained at risk of imminent execution.\n\n29/08/2013\n\n05/06/2013 JUA\n\nISR 5/2013 Israel\n\nArbitrary detention; Independence of judges and lawyers; OPT; Torture;\n\nAlleged severe torture and ill-treatment upon arrest and during interrogation. According to the information received, Mr X, a 16 year-old minor and resident of Hares, Salfit, in the State of Palestine was arrested on 17 March 2013 by members of the Israeli Security Forces (ISF). It is alleged that during transport Mr X was repeatedly pushed, kicked, and hit on the head by ISF, and that in one instance a soldier tried to sit on his head. It is further reported that the soldiers smashed Mr X’s head against an iron box, causing bleeding, and stuffed a piece of cotton and a bandage into his mouth. Furthermore, it is reported that during interrogation an officer attempted to coerce a confession from Mr X by repeatedly threatening to cut off his head, bring in his mother for interrogation, cause difficulties for Mr X’s family at checkpoints, and hold him responsible for other accusations. It is additionally reported that Mr X was held in solitary confinement. Until 21 March 2013, neither his lawyer nor his family were informed about the fate and whereabouts of Mr X, and the first family visit only was scheduled for 11 June 2013.\n\nA /H\n\nR C\n\n/25/74\n\n12\n\nDate Type\n\nCase No\n\nCountry Mandate(s) Summary of the allegation transmitted Reply\n\n05/06/2013 JAL\n\nUSA 7/2013 United States of America\n\nFreedom of religion; Indigenous peoples;\n\nAllegations concerning the increasing number of state-level regulations that restrict the religious freedoms of Native American prisoners. According to the information received, indigenous peoples in the United States face high rates of imprisonment with an approximate 29,700 Native Americans incarcerated in prisons across the country as of 2011. Reportedly, while in prison, a significant number of Native Americans rely upon their freedom to carry out traditional religious practices for rehabilitation purposes and as a means to maintain their identity as members of indigenous peoples. However, numerous recent regulations in state correctional facilities have allegedly restricted Native American prisoners from engaging in traditional religious practices and possessing religious items. It is further alleged that the majority of these regulations are modified or created without meaningful consultation with Native Americans beyond processes for general public comment.\n\n06/06/2013 UA\n\nNGA 3/2013 Nigeria\n\nSummary executions;\n\nAlleged risk of imminent execution of two prisoners on death row before available appeal procedures have been completed. According to the information received, the execution may take place on 7 June 2013. On that date the Federal High Court in Benin City, Nigeria, was expected to deliver its judgment in relation to a lawsuit filed on 19 October 2012 by Nigerian NGOs Human Rights, Social Development and Environmental Foundation (HURSDEF) and Legal Defence and Assistance Project (LEDAP) seeking to halt the execution. Reportedly, arrangements were made by the prison authorities for the executions by hanging to take place as soon as the judgment is delivered. Also it is alleged that since both individuals were convicted of murder, their capital punishments were mandatory. The two prisoners were the subject of an urgent appeal, dated 6 November 2012 (A/HRC/22/67).\n\nA /H\n\nR C\n\n/25/7413\n\nDate Type\n\nCase No\n\nCountry Mandate(s) Summary of the allegation transmitted Reply\n\n07/06/2013 JUA\n\nCOL 6/2013 Colombia\n\nDisappearances; Freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; Human rights defenders;\n\nPresunto robo de información contra miembros de la Fundación Nydia Erika Bautista y actos de hostigamiento contra miembros de la misma organización. Según las informaciones recibidas, el 30 de mayo de 2013, tres individuos habrían ingresado en la residencia familiar del Sr. Erik Antonio Arellana Bautista, miembro de la Fundación Nydia Erika Bautista, llevándose un ordenador y dos discos duros que contenían información relacionada con la Fundación. El Sr. Arellana Bautista se habría enfrentado con los individuos al verlos salir del edificio. Sin embargo, los individuos le habrían intimidado antes de huir en un coche tipo Mazda 323. El presunto robo se sumaría a varios actos de hostigamiento contra la Fundación Nydia Erika Bautista, incluyendo vigilancia por parte de individuos y coches desconocidos frente a las oficinas de la organización.\n\n07/06/2013 JAL\n\nCUB 3/2013 Cuba\n\nHealth; Torture;\n\nAlegación de actos de tortura por parte de agentes policiales en Cuba. De acuerdo a la información recibida, el 26 de agosto de 2007, el Sr. Alberto Lairo Castro fue arrestado y trasladado a un centro de atención por oficiales de la policía en la provincia Holguín. Se reporta que en la prisión los oficiales le habrían aplicado la técnica Doble Nelson y posteriormente lo habrían arrastrado de los pies hasta el calabozo. Eventualmente, el Sr. Lairo Castro fue traslado a un hospital donde fue diagnosticado de paraplejia flácida; hipotrofia muscular; trastornos esfintereanos, y troficodistales. Su estado de salud ha empeorado considerablemente. Durante el proceso de detención, se alega que no estuvo presente ningún abogado o familiar. Se informa que el individuo y su familia no han recibido compensación. Se reporta que el individuo y su madre no tuvieron la oportunidad de intervenir en la investigación y que no pudieron asistir al juicio, por ende la víctima no fue interrogada por los jueces. Asimismo, el Tribunal no suspendió el juicio, basando su veredicto en la declaración de los acusados. Se reporta que la sanción de la Fiscalía, fue de 2 años de privación de libertad, la cual es desproporcional a los daños ocasionados.\n\nA /H\n\nR C\n\n/25/74\n\n14\n\nDate Type\n\nCase No\n\nCountry Mandate(s) Summary of the allegation transmitted Reply\n\n07/06/2013 JUA\n\nITA 1/2013 Italy\n\nIndependence of judges and lawyers; Migrants; Torture;\n\nAlleged deportation by the Italian authorities in violation of the principle of non- refoulement and due process guarantees.

Two days after her arrest Ms Alma Shalabayeva was reportedly deported from Italy to Kazakhstan together with her 6-year-old daughter. Allegedly, while moving quickly to deport Ms Shalabayeva and her daughter, the Italian authorities violated Italian legislation on immigration and her due process rights. In particular, while in detention Ms Shalabayeva’s lawyers did not have access to her, and she was not provided with an interpreter.\n\n12/07/2013 30/07/2013 12/08/2013\n\n07/06/2013 JUA\n\nMMR 8/2013 Myanmar\n\nArbitrary detention; Freedom of expression; Freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; Minority issues; Myanmar; Torture;\n\nAlleged arbitrary detention and arrests, ill-treatment in detention and violation of due process rights of seven Rohingyas, including one minor, in Rakhine State.

Allegedly this would mean the destruction of most of the remaining unrecognized Arab Bedouin villages in this region.

Reportedly, the appeal courts rejected the claim that Mr Van Poyck’s legal representation at trial was constitutionally inadequate. Allegedly, Mr Van Poyck has spent more than 25 years on death row.

According to information received, a recent decision by the Lesotho High Court upheld a provision of the Chieftainship Act No 10 of 1968, which discriminates against women. Section 10 of this Act is a restatement and codification of Lesotho customary law regarding succession to the office of a Chief. Sections 10(2) & (3) of the Act only allow a son of a Chief to succeed to that office, denying the same right to a daughter. If no son is available Section 10(4) of the Act allows a Chief’s wife to succeed; however, once that wife’s tenure ends, only the brother or uncle of the previous male Chief may succeed. Despite the Lesotho Constitution protecting freedom from discrimination in section 18, sections 18(4)(b) & (c) create an exception for laws such as “application[s] of the customary law of Lesotho”.\n\n02/09/2013\n\nA /H\n\nR C\n\n/25/7431\n\nDate Type\n\nCase No\n\nCountry Mandate(s) Summary of the allegation transmitted Reply\n\n28/06/2013 JUA\n\nSYR 3/2013 Syrian Arab Republic\n\nArbitrary detention; Freedom of expression; Freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; Human rights defenders; Independence of judges and lawyers; Terrorism; Torture;\n\nAlleged acts of reprisal, incommunicado detention and torture and ill-treatment of human rights defenders for their cooperation with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights.

Mazen Darwish, Hussayn Gharir, Hani Zitani, Abdelrahman Alhamade and Mansour Al-Omari, who were arrested in the context of the raid on the offices of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM) on 16 February 2012, spent nine months in incommunicado detention while being refused access to medication. They have reportedly suffered torture and ill-treatment while in detention. Messrs. Alhamade and Al-Omari were reportedly released pending trial. Charges of promoting terrorist acts have been brought against all of them. It is believed that they relate to, and were motivated by, the SCM’s activities in defence of human rights, and that the SCM has been criticized as inciting international mechanisms to condemn Syria in response to its cooperation with various UN human rights mechanisms. Mr Khalil Matouk, a prominent human rights lawyer and Director of the Syrian Centre for Legal Studies and Research, at the time of writing reportedly remained in incommunicado detention with Mr Mohammed Thatha, a colleague. Mr Matouk has represented a number of human rights defenders legally and has submitted information to United Nations special procedures on these and other cases both before and after the start of the Syrian conflict.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests reportedly created an exemption for consent requirements in the case of modifications to the use of forest lands for the development of what are termed “linear projects”. It is alleged that this consent exemption provision will negatively affect the rights of many indigenous peoples in India who are not “pre-agricultural communities” or “primitive tribal groups” but rather fall under the category of “Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribes” or “other traditional forest dwellers”.

Selon les informations reçues, depuis les événements du 24 mars 2013 qui ont conduit la coalition Séléka au pouvoir, il y aurait une aggravation de la situation des droits de l’homme. Des exactions auraient été commises sur les populations civiles, sur l’ensemble du territoire. De nombreux cas d’assassinat, de torture, de violence sexuelle envers les femmes et les filles, de disparitions forcées, de « justice populaire » ainsi que de pillages systématiques ont été portés à l’attention des Procédures Spéciales. Ceux-ci suggèrent un climat d’insécurité généralisé, l’absence d’état de droit et une impunité favorisant des abus graves et systématiques, qui seraient majoritairement commis par des groupes armés affiliés à la coalition Séléka.\n\nA /H\n\nR C\n\n/25/74\n\n42\n\nDate Type\n\nCase No\n\nCountry Mandate(s) Summary of the allegation transmitted Reply\n\n16/07/2013 JAL\n\nGMB 1/2013 Gambia\n\nFreedom of expression; Human rights defenders;\n\nAlleged lack of compliance of the amended Information and Communication Act with international human rights law.
