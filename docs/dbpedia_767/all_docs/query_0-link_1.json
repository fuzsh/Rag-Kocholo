        "text": "\"\n\nTravez is one of the promoters who made it possible for Quevedo to become a university city. In an interview, Travez recalled that the origins of the university were the result of the struggle of many high school graduates and citizens of Quevedo, who wanted our city to have an institution of higher education.\n\nOswaldo Travez recalled his comrades in struggle, among whom he mentioned Narcilo Díaz, Marco Cortés, Alcides Maldonado, Francisco Rodríguez, Julio Almache, among others, who he said were the main precursors for Quevedo to have a university that would allow the professionalisation of thousands of high school graduates from the schools that existed in the 60s and 70s.\n\nOne of the first attempts to achieve its objective was the formation of the Quevedo High School Students Association, which sent communications to local authorities and institutions in order to lobby the national government and to lobby universities in the country so that at least some extensions could operate in Quevedo. Later, the committee for the creation of the university was formed, and after several negotiations, the university extension of the Luis Vargas Torres University of Esmeraldas was set up with the degrees of Zootechnics and Forestry.\n\nSubsequently, the committee's efforts led to the legislative decree that created the Quevedo State Technical University on 1 February 1984.\n\n\"It is important for students, teachers and the community to know the history of the university, which is the product of hard work and not something that fell out of the sky,\" he said.\n\n\""
