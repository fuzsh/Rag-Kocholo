The main purpose is to carry out an exhaustive diagnosis of the management of physical assets (GAF) in this entity and to propose improvements that are rigorously aligned with the standards of the ISO 55XXX family (000, 001, 002) (Torres, 2015). The process of identifying these companies was developed through field research, meticulously adjusted to the parameters established by the Andean Community of Nations. This approach resulted in the identification of three companies that meet the defined criteria and are regulated by the Superintendency of Companies.\n\nThe detailed characterization of these companies was carried out through interviews with general managers, revealing with precision that INDUHORST C�A LTDA exhibits a particularly well-organized maintenance management. The application of diagnostics through additional interviews in this company yielded conclusive results: the current management addresses only the maintenance stage. In response to this finding, it is suggested to implement improvements based on ISO 55xxx standards (000, 001 and 002). The specific proposal is to strengthen maintenance management before introducing physical asset management, in strict accordance with the principles established by ISO 55000 (Novillo, 2013).\n\nIn addition, it is recommended that INDUHORST C�A LTDA develop a specific \"physical asset management improvement\" project through outsourcing, a strategy that would be implemented after consolidating maintenance management. This approach seeks to maximize effectiveness and efficiency in the management of physical assets through a robust methodology.\n\nIn a broader temporal context, asset management has become a crucial discipline to optimize the management of physical assets in Quevedo's small metalworking industries. This process seeks to improve the relationship between risks, costs and performance throughout the asset life cycle. In asset-intensive operations, asset reliability, availability, efficiency, maintenance and safety play a key role in achieving sustainable profitability.\n\nThis work not only aims to obtain a detailed characterization of the small metalworking companies in Quevedo and a comprehensive diagnosis of the management of physical assets in INDUHORST CIA LTDA, but also to establish an auditable reference framework according to ISO 55000. The implementation of this framework will not only allow to evaluate the current status, but will also guide each evaluation towards an analysis focused on preventing and improving the existing system, thus promoting continuous improvement in the management of physical assets.\n\nUltimately, physical assets, which include basic and specialized technological systems that support the operations of these companies, play a critical role. Their detailed attention throughout the life cycle is essential to determine and contribute to the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of these companies in the metal-mechanic sector�(Vera, 2020).\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nType of research\n\nThis is a diagnostic research to perform a characterization of the small metal-mechanic industries and to make a diagnosis of the management of physical assets in the company INDUHORST C�A LTDA.\n\nField research\n\nThis research was conducted through the interview technique applied by means of the interview guide instrument in which situations that could be observed were recorded by capturing relevant data provided by primary sources such as general managers of small metalworking companies in the canton of Quevedo and the head of maintenance of the company INDUHORST CIA LTDA, in order to obtain data and documents to develop the research.\n\nResearch methods\n\nDeductive method\n\nThis method was used in the study of the theoretical underpinnings at the global and local levels to argue the development of the research.\n\nAnalytical method\n\nIt consisted of the analysis of each of the results obtained in the interviews that allowed obtaining conclusive data for the development of the research proposal.\n\nSynthetic method\n\nThis method was applied to synthesize the summary of the document, conclusions and recommendations.\n\nSources of information gathering\n\nPrimary sources\n\nThe primary source was used since it allowed the collection of information through the research, to obtain data from the general managers and maintenance chief of the small metal-mechanic industries, since they contribute with valuable information for the research.\n\nSecondary sources\n\nSecondary source was used for this research work since already existing information such as scientific articles were used in order to reveal research results in a clear and concise manner and similar theses on asset management.\n\nResearch design\n\nNon-experimental design\n\nThis design was used in the development of this research because the research is based on theoretical support taken from undergraduate and graduate theses, scientific articles and journals. The improvement approach is based on the general aspects for asset management and asset management systems provided by the ISO 55000 standard; also the ISO 55001 standard specifies the requirements to establish, implement, maintain and improve asset management and the ISO 55002 standard provides the guidelines for asset management according to the requirements specified in 55001�(Tholana & Neingo, 2016).\n\nResearch instruments\n\nInterview\n\nThe interview technique was used by means of the instrument \"interview guide\" applied to the general managers of the small metal-mechanic companies identified to know the maturity level of their companies and to the maintenance manager of INDUHORST C�A LTDA, so questions were elaborated to know if maintenance is managed.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIdentification of small companies in the metal-mechanic sector in the canton of Quevedo\n\nTo begin with the development of the research we will start with the identification of the small metal-mechanical companies in the canton of Quevedo, for which we classified the companies that belong to this sector:\n\nClassification of small metal-mechanical companies\n\nAccording to the characteristics of small metalworking companies in the canton of Quevedo there are three entities that belong to this sector which are detailed below:\n\nTable 1. Classification of small metalworking companies\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nTo obtain this information and classify the small companies that belong to this sector, the size of the company, number of workers and consequently they are not artisanal micro-companies must be taken into account. One of the parameters to be measured is the level of maturity of the small metal-mechanical companies, for which 4 levels were determined:\n\n� Level 1 vulnerable; this level is obtained when the company is very sensitive to changes.\n\n� Level 2 stable; this level remains unchanged, its purpose is to be present and to comply.\n\n� Level 3 growth; characterized by applying new trends, seeking knowledge to make better use of resources and have less organizational waste.\n\n� Level 4 continuous improvement; characterized by having a strong organizational culture attached to leadership, values and strategies.\n\nFor the collection of information on the maturity level in small metalworking industries, we started with the information established by (Monta�o, Corona, & Gomez, 2018), which identifies the various requirements and factors to be considered for each of them, as detailed in the following table:\n\nTable 2. Maturity levels of small companies\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nCharacterization of the small metal-mechanical company MAQGRO C�A LTDA\n\nMAQGRO C�A LTDA is an industrial company created to manufacture and commercialize agricultural, wood, food and construction machinery. It was created on January 1, 2006 with the purpose of keeping in permanent evolution and development in the competitive markets becoming one of the best companies in terms of machinery production, which has allowed the company to constantly renew its technology in such a way that it achieves the highest standards of quality and efficiency with the products it manufactures.\n\nObjectives\n\nGeneral Objective\n\n� To manufacture machinery that allows day by day to innovate the technology to visualize its better development in diverse areas that can be used in related situations and that allow to maintain the growth in the market.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\n� Quantify the company's investments and profits.\n\n� To always train the personnel so that they can perform better in their functions.\n\n� Constantly innovate technology\n\nMission\n\nTo manufacture and commercialize machinery for agribusiness in order to satisfy the countless needs of farmers, improving quality and efficiency, as well as the innovation of the personnel involved in production.\n\nVision\n\nIt is aimed at satisfying the internal demand for small, medium and large farmers, implementing high standards of quality and innovation in its products in order to compete with the foreign market.\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nFigure 1. Organizational structure of MAQGRO C�A LTDA.\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nResults of the interview technique applied to Mr. Marco Gilberto Garc�a Sangoquiza, general manager of the small company MAQGRO C�A LTDA.\n\nDeduction of the maturity level\n\nTable 3.� Analysis of maturity levels MAQGRO C�A LTDA\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nAnalysis: The behavior of the maturity levels of the requirements can be evaluated as low, if we consider that 71% reach levels lower or equal to 2, four of them are classified in level 2 and one requirement in level 1. Requirement R4 of resource management reaches the lowest level, which results in a disadvantage in asset management. On the other hand, R5 linked to the organization of the company is at level 2, an essential element for good asset management. The results displayed are close to a \"stable\" rating for the company, with the consideration that two requirements of importance reach very low values.\n\nMaintenance organization\n\nFactor: technical documentation�\n\nAnalysis: As indicated above, there is no maintenance plan and therefore no technical documentation is managed.\n\nFactor: Equipment history\n\nAnalysis: Although there is no maintenance plan, the interviewee states that there is an equipment history and that it is generally updated every 3 months; however, from the answers to the questions it is clear that most of the equipment and machinery involved in the production process do not have a maintenance history (preventive and corrective); in other words, only a few pieces of equipment such as compressors, plasmas and drills are monitored and their maintenance service is outsourced.�\n\nFactor: Follow-up of work orders\n\nAnalysis: The lack of a maintenance plan results in the non-existence of the maintenance work order and consequently there is no way to manage it.\n\nFactor: Budget distribution\n\nAnalysis: It was mentioned earlier that certain equipment and machines are taken to another company for maintenance (outsourcing), so there is a maintenance budget.\n\nFactor: Planning and scheduling of maintenance activities.\n\nAnalysis: This factor is directly related to maintenance planning; therefore, this factor is not met in the small company.\n\nFactor: control of materials and spare parts\n\nAnalysis: This factor is met because there is a software and an official (warehouse manager) who carries out this control, but above all, the raw material to be used is controlled.�\n\nFactor: Control of maintenance costs\n\nAnalysis: There is only a budget to cover the costs of outsourced maintenance.\n\nFactor: Management index\n\nAnalysis: Since there is no maintenance planning, this factor is not applied in the small company; therefore, there is a lack of knowledge of maintenance management.\n\nFactor: Contracting policies\n\nAnalysis: In the case of this factor, there is only a contracting policy \"by mutual agreement with the outsourcing company\".\n\nFactor: Contractor selection\n\nAnalysis: As in the previous factor, only the contractor is selected in the case of outsourced maintenance according to experience and maintenance needs; generally these outsourcing companies are from Quito and Guayaquil.\n\nFactor: Control at reception\n\nAnalysis: For this factor, the equipment is tested by the operator who is a specialist in handling the equipment.\n\nFactor: Warranty\n\nAnalysis: In terms of warranty, the companies generally guarantee the work performed in accordance with the cost, brand, and time of acquisition of the equipment.\n\nCharacterization of the small metal-mechanical company INDUHORST C�A LTDA\n\nINDUHORST C�A LTDA, develops and supplies complete equipment for grain treatment from harvesting to dry and clean storage, including all loading and unloading, drying and cleaning equipment. It is also dedicated to the commercialization of equipment and spare parts that are designed and produced in the facilities of the producers Jatun Huayra, Mephisto and M.C.M. The materials used are of first quality under the brands of recognized worldwide prestige.\n\nObjectives\n\nFulfill customer requirements ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction.\n\nImplement technological innovations for the benefit of the customer and the company.\n\nSeek continuous improvement through ongoing staff training.\n\nMaintain a process management system certified by the ISO 9001 standard.\n\nMission\n\nTo deliver innovative products that meet the needs of our Agribusiness customers, and generate for the company the results required to support growth and development.\n\nVision\n\nTo be the first company in Ecuador for its technology generation and innovative product offer, both in the local and international market.\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nFigure 3. Organizational structure of INDUHORST C�A LTDA.\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nResult of the interview technique applied to Mr. Carlos Castro, general manager of the small company INDUHORST C�A LTDA.\n\nDeduction of the maturity level\n\nTable 4. Analysis of maturity levels INDUHORST C�A LTDA\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nAnalysis: All the maturity levels of the requirements are equal or higher than the second level, four reach level 2, two reach level 3 and one reaches level 4. In this company 57% of the requirements reach level 2, while the remaining one is higher than this level. It should be added that none of the requirements is rated at the lowest level. Unlike the previous company, requirement R4 is at the highest level, which favors asset management, while R5, linked to the organization, is placed at level 2. Although the company could be evaluated at level 2, it would be fair to accept that it is an advantageous level 2 or close to level 3.\n\nMaintenance organization\n\nFactor: technical documentation\n\nAnalysis: If there is a maintenance plan, but there is no work order document, what exists is a technical sheet.\n\nFactor: Equipment history\n\nAnalysis: The interviewee stated that there is no equipment history, there is only an equipment file, but there is a systematic investigation of the most frequent breakdowns.\n\nFactor: Work order follow-up\n\nAnalysis: There is a maintenance plan, but there is no maintenance work order document, so there is no way to manage it.\n\nFactor: Budget distribution\n\nAnalysis: The interviewee mentioned that certain equipment and machines are taken to another company for maintenance, so there is a maintenance budget.\n\nFactor: Planning and scheduling of maintenance activities.\n\nAnalysis: There is a lubrication and maintenance plan for the equipment, and it is also established who prepares and executes the maintenance plans.\n\nFactor: Control of materials and spare parts\n\nAnalysis: This factor is complied with because there are personnel who carry out the control and, above all, control the raw materials to be handled.\n\nFactor: Control of maintenance costs\n\nAnalysis: There is only one budget to cover outsourced maintenance costs.\n\nFactor: Management index\n\nAnalysis: The interviewee stated that there is knowledge of management indicators within the maintenance area and that they are used for decision making.\n\nFactor: Contracting policies\n\nAnalysis: For this factor there is only the policy of contracting outsourcing companies.\n\nFactor: Contractor selection\n\nAnalysis: In the case of outsourced maintenance, the contractor is selected based on suppliers and experience, and when this cannot be done within the small company, these outsourcing companies are generally located in Quito and Guayaquil.\n\nFactor: Control of reception\n\nAnalysis: As for this factor, the equipment and machinery are inspected by the specialist operator, but there is no documentation.\n\nFactor: Warranty\n\nAnalysis: In terms of warranty, the companies generally guarantee the work performed, but compliance with the warranty is verified.\n\nCharacterization of the small metal-mechanic company JATARIG C�A LTDA.\n\nQuevede�a industry with the highest international quality standards, we are JATARIG C�A LTDA, your main ally in the processes with your agro-industrial machines always looking for the highest productivity in the shortest possible time, for that reason we are located in a strategic place in the south of the city, km 7 via Mocache at the foot of the main road.\n\nWe make available to you and your companies the most sophisticated agro-industrial machinery manufactured with high quality standards, seeking to solve and facilitate your agricultural activities.\n\nMission\n\nTo produce the best equipment and machinery meeting the highest quality standards, with a highly qualified human and professional team, satisfying the needs and demands of the customer.\n\nVision\n\nTo offer to the province and the country a complete and efficient consultancy with the best products in the market, simplifying their work, optimizing their resources and improving their productivity, thus contributing to the growth of the country.\n\nOrganizational structure\n\nFigure 4.

RAQUEL REYES (2017)\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nResults of the interview technique applied to Mrs. Raquel Reyes, general manager of the small company JARATIG C�A LTDA.\n\nDeduction of maturity level\n\nTable 5. Analysis of maturity levels JARATIG C�A LTDA\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nAnalysis: In the company JATARIG CIA LTDA five of the requirements reach levels equal or higher than 2, while the other requirements reach level 3. 71% of the requirements are rated at level 2, but it differs from MAQGRO CIA LTDA in that none of its requirements is rated with the minimum level. In this case, R4 and R5 are rated at level 2, which does not favor a good asset management, if we talk about the management of resources and the organization of the company, respectively.\n\nMaintenance organization\n\nFactor: technical documentation\n\nAnalysis: Initially it was indicated that there is no maintenance plan and therefore no technical documentation is managed.\n\nFactor: Equipment history\n\nAnalysis: Since there is no maintenance plan, the interviewee stated that there is no equipment history and that generally when the lathe breaks down, production is paralyzed because there is no replacement.\n\nFactor: Work order follow-up\n\nAnalysis: The lack of a maintenance plan results in the non-existence of the maintenance work order and subsequently there is no way to manage it.\n\nFactor: Budget distribution\n\nAnalysis: Some equipment and machines are taken to another company for maintenance (outsourcing), so there is a maintenance budget.\n\nFactor: Planning and scheduling of maintenance activities.\n\nAnalysis: This factor is directly related to maintenance planning; therefore, this factor is not met in the small company.\n\nFactor: Control of materials and spare parts\n\nAnalysis: This factor is not met because there is no official in charge of the control of materials and spare parts.\n\nFactor: Cost control of materials\n\nAnalysis: There is a budget to cover only outsourced maintenance costs.\n\nFactor: Management index\n\nAnalysis: Since there is no maintenance planning, this factor is not applied in small companies, therefore there is a lack of knowledge of maintenance management.\n\nFactor: Contracting policies\n\nAnalysis: In the case of this factor, there is only a contracting policy with mutual agreement with the outsourcing company.\n\nFactor: Contractor selection\n\nAnalysis: For this factor, only outsourced maintenance is selected according to experience and maintenance needs; these outsourcing companies are usually from Guayaquil and Quito.\n\nFactor: control at reception\n\nAnalysis: For this factor, a diagnosis of the operation of the equipment is made by the operator specialized in the handling of the equipment.\n\nFactor: Warranty\n\nAnalysis: Regarding the warranty, companies usually guarantee the work performed according to the cost, brand and time of acquisition of the equipment.\n\nSummary of results issued by the respective instruments on the maintenance management of small companies in the canton of Quevedo.\n\nTable 6. Summary of maintenance management results\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nConclusion\n\nAccording to the summary of results on maintenance management inscribed in (table 1), the company that presents a maintenance management with greater evidence of organization according to the documents that is carried, is the small company INDUHORST C�A LTDA; that is to say that it can develop and then implement the project of \"improvement of the management of physical assets\" because this industry has implemented its production process from the design; therefore both internally and to its customers can offer in the future the Asset Management from the generation to the end of its life as proposed by the ISO 55000 standard.\n\nDiagnosis of the management of physical assets of the small metal-mechanic company INDUHORST C�A LTDA.\n\nDetermination of the documents to be handled in a maintenance plan\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of, (Garcia M, Gonzales S, & Cort�s M, 2009), there are documents that are being executed in the company: technical data sheet, critical machines (paralyzes production process), schedule plan.\n\nAccording to the authors,�(Garcia M, Gonzales S, & Cort�s M, 2009), Another additional instrument required for a maintenance plan is the work order that the company must implement.\n\nDevelop a training plan that involves all operators, managers and administrators in production, maintenance, quality control, design, storage and facilities activities.\n\nComplementary areas of the administrative organization chart\n\nIt is considered that the transcendental and complementary areas of maintenance are: production, design, facilities, quality, health and safety area, which the company considers in the established organization chart.\n\nMachines and equipment offered by the company INDUHORST C�A LTDA\n\nTable 7. Machinery and equipment offered by INDUHORST C�A LTDA\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nMachines and equipment for the food agroindustry\n\nTable 8. Machinery and equipment for the food agroindustry\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nProposed improvements in maintenance management\n\nAs indicated by,�(Ormaza M, F�liz L, Real P, & Parra F, 2015). The proposal is based on the analyses carried out in the previous stages and then defines the main shortcomings, determines measures, establishes actions and those responsible for them.\n\nTable 9. Improvement proposal based on the maintenance management diagnosis\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nTable 10. Proposals based on the diagnosis of OTM maintenance management\n\nSOURCE: FIELD RESEARCH\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nAnalysis: Once the imperfections have been overcome, the implementation of physical asset management based on the ISO 55000 standard will begin (Minnaar, Basson, & Vlok, 2013), as proposed in the following table.\n\nTable 11. Improvement approach based on ISO 55xxx family of standards (000, 001 and 002)\n\nSOURCE: NTE INEN-ISO 55000\n\nPREPARED BY: AUTHORS (2017)\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nUntil the completion of this research in Quevedo there are three companies with the legal denomination of small, because they meet the number of servers, according to resolution of the CAN (Andean Community of Nations), ie the size of the companies in this category must have between 10 to 49 people and consequently are not artisanal microenterprises.\n\nOnce the small metal-mechanical companies in the canton of Quevedo were identified, we proceeded to characterize each of them, using the technique of interviewing the general managers of MAQGRO C�A LTDA, JATARIG C�A LTDA and INDUHORST C�A LTDA, the head of maintenance, proving that most of them do not efficiently manage the maintenance of the physical assets involved in the production processes.\n\nThe diagnosis of the management of physical assets in the small metal-mechanic industry INDUHORST C�A LTDA determines that the maintenance of the machines involved in the production processes is managed and not all the stages of the physical assets of these processes, because in reality according to�(Le�n G, Valero Y, & Vera M, 2020) , \"Asset management is a way of integrating all areas of the organization so that the asset life cycle is managed during the stages of design, construction, utilization, maintenance, and decommissioning or repowering.\".\n\nThe diagnosis carried out in the selected small company shows that only one stage of asset management, maintenance, is being managed. This situation allows the development of the improvement proposal based on maintenance management and improvements based on the NTE INEN - ISO 55000, ISO 55001 and ISO 55002 family of standards.\n\nReferencias\n\nGarcia M, G., Gonzales S, H., & Cort�s M, E.
