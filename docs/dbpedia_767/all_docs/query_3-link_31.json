        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn the world market for cut flowers, this sector continues to grow, with the Netherlands being the main exporter of flowers with 45% of world exports, followed by Colombia with 16%, and finally Ecuador, Kenya and Belgium, which contribute 10, 8 and 3%, respectively, of total flower exports in the world (Manrique et al., 2014). This increase demands high production requirements, but in relation to quality, demanded in different markets, involving plant breeding material, soil and substrate management, fertilizer use, phytosanitary products, harvesting, as well as post-harvest treatments (Chen et al., 2013)\n\nIn Colombia, the floriculture sector is one of the pillars of the economy, it is characterized by its great contributions to the development of the national economy represented in its high level in the GDP and a potential generator of employment ( the departments of Antioquia and Cundinamarca are attributed to be the main producers of cut flowers with more than 8,000 ha in production, as of 2015 with about 10.9% average annual growth in exports, and are concentrated in the savannah of Bogotá with 66%, (Jabeen & Chadha, 2021)\n\nCurrently, with the evolution of markets, crops were diversified in order to increase competitiveness, which implies the export of more than 50 types of flowers and foliage. For 2016, rose represented 22% of the total exported, followed by pompon with 15%, carnation represented 14%, while foliages occupied 27% (CCB, 2016). This sector shows a strengthening process in the country, flower exports from Colombia reported US$75.5 million up to April 2018, with a volume of 14,415 t remaining as one of the first exporting countries despite the global oversupply and currently occupying the second place (Frank et al., 2019)\n\nIn the case of floriculture, sustainability is based on the efficient use of resources, where the concept of cleaner production (CP) is applicable. In every production system, waste is generated as a product of the processes of each system. CP is defined as the continuous application of preventive environmental strategies to processes, products and services in order to increase efficiency and minimize risks to human health and the environment Thus, the PML has a large number of benefits that contribute to the continuous improvement of the company, it contributes to support in different areas either in terms of production processes, products and services, in order to reduce costs, encourage innovations and reduce relevant risks to humans and the environment (Jun et al., 2015). LWP favors the reduction of operating costs and risks, waste management, optimization of resource use, elimination/reduction of waste, effluents and emissions, improvement of plant operational efficiency, energy efficiency, increases productivity and competitiveness with the improvement of the company's image (Peñas et al., 2012). A constant evolution in the efficiency of production systems and government policies has allowed the control of the environmental impact of production activities and has encouraged companies to develop strategies to achieve more sustainable operations by modifying current production and consumption patterns (Lapoujade, 2016)\n\nTaking into account the environmental context, in recent years a growing awareness of sustainable production schemes and certified systems in agriculture emerged, and numerous scientific studies aimed at improving the environmental performance of these production processes have been carried out (Hanschen et al., 2018), the Colombian association of flower exporters, ASOCOLFORES, created the Florverde Sustainable Flowers certification program, as a tool that promotes social responsibility and seeks the adoption of good agricultural practices, minimization of the use of agrochemicals, protection of the fundamental rights of workers, product quality and managerial responsibility (SUN et al., 2018) in addition, the importance of Rainforest Alliance, homologous with the guidelines of the secretariat of the Sustainable Agriculture Network that manages certification systems (Perumal et al., 2021)\n\nAt present, the floricultural sector has adopted several techniques of good practices and LMP in its processes as certification requirements demand it, therefore, a research is proposed based on a descriptive bibliometric analysis, a methodology of quantitative analysis used with the purpose of studying the historical course of a field of knowledge from records such as periodical and non-periodical publications of the specialty (Joel et al., 2020) This review document aims to show the evolution of PML in the flower sector in the world and in Colombia since 2005, in order to compare the studies carried out in Colombia with respect to the world, taking into account its economic importance worldwide in the export of cut flowers.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nLocation and duration of the investigation.\n\nThis research was conducted at the Experimental Farm \"La María\", Faculty of Livestock Sciences of the State Technical University of Quevedo (UTEQ), located at km 7 ½ of the road Quevedo - El Empalme, whose geographical location is 1º 6' 23\" south latitude and 79º 29' 12\" west longitude and at an altitude of 73 meters above sea level. The climatic conditions of the locality are: temperature 24.80 °C, relative humidity 88 %, rainfall 343.70 and average evaporation of 65.50 mm, this research had a duration of 43 days.\n\nExperiment management\n\nThe research carried out was of an exploratory, formative, documentary and field type, which contributes to the research line: agronomic behavior, evaluation and improvement of the nutritional characteristics and conservation methods of grasses, legumes, fodder trees, agricultural by-products and agro-industrial residues for domestic animal feeding purposes. Exploratory type, the productive parameters, the improvement of the nutritional quality, as well as the organoleptic characteristics of the meat, on which the acceptability by the consumer depends, were measured. The quantitative method was used to evaluate the productive parameters of the variables under investigation, the qualitative method was used to evaluate the organoleptic characteristics of the meat, and the experimental method was used to determine the best feeding treatment with Tukey significance tests at 5% probability. A completely randomized design (CRD) was used with three treatments and five replicates, four unsexed turkeys per experimental unit. To analyze the organoleptic characteristics, they were evaluated by means of a nonparametric descriptive statistical analysis of affectivity with Hedonic scales of Attribute Intensity. Tables 1 and 2 show the ADEVA and the description of the research treatments. The statistical model, under which the response variables were analyzed, is as follows:\n\nResult\n\nAnalysis of the data obtained from the production indexes\n\nFood consumption\n\nThe results regarding the highest consumption (P≤0.05) were recorded by treatments T2 and T3 in each of the evaluated periods and in the total, with respect to the control treatment (see Table 3), these values may be related to the higher palatability of the cabbage, agreeing with what is stated in the Manual (Jun et al., 2015) which considers that cabbage leaves are a food that these birds like because these animals are good foragers if they are supplied with green pasture. However, the results obtained in the present research agree with those reported by (Nurhidayati et al., 2016) who investigated the productive and economic evaluation of the fattening of turkeys of the Nicholas 700 strain, obtaining a feed consumption at week 15 of 4,052 g. Nurhidayati et al. (2016) in their turkey breeding and fattening manual reports similar values of feed consumed in sexed animals with an average value for females and males of 4,035 g, these results being relatively close to those obtained in the present study. Jun et al. (2015) in his research reported a total consumption of 20521.64 value lower than those obtained in this study. Frank et al. (2018) when evaluating zeolite in diets for turkeys under commercial production conditions showed a consumption of 4200 g with 0% clinoptilolite treatment and 5000 g of feed consumption in week 17, where no significant statistical differences were found between these treatments; however, the method without clinoptilolite addition presents values that agree with those obtained in this research. when evaluating Leucaena leucocephala meal in diets for growing and fattening turkeys, obtained the highest feed consumption in the treatment with 7.5% substitution of wheat flour for leucaena meal with pre-mixing, (4,980 and 6.135 g), the lowest feed consumption values were for the treatment with 15% substitution of soybean meal by leucaena meal plus pre-mix (4,457 and 5,600 g for males and females, respectively), being these values higher than those obtained in the present research work.\n\nThe results obtained in terms of weekly live weight show that treatment T1 and T2 obtained the best averages of initial weight with respect to treatment T3 (see Table 4), while in final weight, treatment T2 obtained the best results, taking into account that the initial weight of treatment T2 was higher than that of treatment T3.\n\nTable 5 shows that the highest weight gain in weeks 13, 14, 15, 16 and total is presented by treatment T3 followed by treatments T2 and T1. These values coincide with those reported by Nurhidayati et al. (2016) in his line of feed for turkeys reporting values of 1100 g in the fattening phase. However, Jun et al. (2015) when performing the productive and economic evaluation of the fattening of Nicholas 700 turkeys, reports in week 15 a value of 1167 g, as well as Joel et al. (2020), in their study with zeolite in turkey diet recorded a weight at week 17 of 1200 g, a value that agrees with the data recorded in this research. Perumal et al. (2021) who evaluated the productive performance and carcass yield in turkeys fed feather meal treated with NaOH also reports results of 165.8, 127.0 and 144.0 g per day for the control treatment, 50 g of NaOH and 100 g of NaOH respectively, so that when the calculation is made for the seven days of the week it yields average values of 1160.60 g, 889.00 and 1008.00 g so that the control treatment agrees with the results of this study since the other treatments were not effective in terms of weight gain.\n\nFeed conversion\n\nThe most efficient feed conversion (P<0.05) was recorded by treatment T3 in each of the periods 13, 15, 16 and total, followed by treatment T2 (see Table 6). These results are similar to those obtained by Hanschen et al. (2018) who evaluated the performance of growing turkeys fed diets with different agro-industrial by-products, reporting a feed conversion of 3.74. However, Peñas et al. (2012) when evaluating the use of forage soybean (Neonotonia Whightii) in the feeding of fattening turkeys and evaluation of the industrial process of their meat obtained a feed conversion of 3.92 for animals in confinement, 3.68 for animals in pasture and 3.77 for the control treatment, so these values are similar to those of this research LI et al., (2018) in their research on the effects of feeding turkeys with wet feed plus fresh vegetables (Chard, beta vulgaris; Cabbage, Brassica oleracea; Turnip, Brassica napus L) in the growth and fattening stage, obtained a feed conversion of 4.40 g in turkeys fed with cabbage (Brassica oleracea) in the fattening stage, while in the current study the conversion is more efficient as shown in (Table 6). While LI et al., (2018) investigated the productive indicators of Mexican turkeys in confinement conditions where these authors indicate that the feed conversion at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 was 3.47, 2.80, 3.71 and 2.58 respectively, data that disagree with the results of this study.\n\nCarcass yield (%)\n\nThe best carcass yield in percentage was recorded by treatment T2 (see table 7) in comparison to treatment T3, it is worth mentioning that treatment T2 obtained an initial weight of 9.04 kg, while treatment T3 started with a weight of 8.54 so it is considered that treatment T3 was the best, these values are higher than those reported by Chauca, (2015) in his study using diets with different levels of protein plus essential and semi-essential amino acids in the initial, growth and finishing phases in Hybrid turkeys registering a yield of 83.Meanwhile, it reported a carcass weight of 13.61 kg in birds that consumed a diet with 19% protein, which were the animals that reached the best average, as well as the T3 treatment that reached a carcass weight of 13.20 kg. Taking into account that the average initial weight of the birds under study was 9.14 kg, these values are similar to those of this study. The carcass yield percentages of the birds in this study were higher than those obtained by Jabeen & Chadha (2021) who reported a yield of 78.94 % in native Mexican turkeys fed a balanced commercial diet, combined with grazing, starting at 16 weeks of age. On the other hand Chen et al. (2013) who carried out the comparison of weight gain in turkey poults fed a commercial diet and two diets supplemented with 4 and 6 % of California red worm (Eisenia foetida), reached final weights of 13.20 kg for turkeys fed with 4 % of California red worm, followed by a weight of 13.04 kg for the birds fed with 6% worm and a weight of 11.81 kg for the control treatment. It is worth mentioning that these results of the 6% worm treatment started with 60 g less than those of the control treatment and 90 g with respect to the 4% worm treatment, results lower than those shown in (Table 7) in terms of the final weight of the birds. While Jabeen & Chadha (2021) in their work Global Vision of Current Turkey Meat Production reports values of final weights with 15.8 kg being these values similar to those obtained in the present study.\n\nEconomic analysis\n\nThe economic analysis of the treatments is detailed in Table 8. The best gross income value was generated by treatment T2 with (1774.41 USD), but the lowest income was generated by treatment T1 with a value of (1660.30 USD). For the total costs of the treatments of this research, it can be seen that with the addition of 10% cabbage, the highest cost (895.18 USD) is produced, while the lowest production cost was generated by treatment T1 (880.18 USD). The highest net benefit was presented by treatment T2 (885.23 USD) and the lowest benefit was obtained by treatment T1 (780.12 USD). The highest benefit/cost ratio was for treatment T2 (99.56) and the lowest profitability was for the control treatment (88.63).\n\nProximate analysis of turkey meat\n\nTable 9 shows the proximate analysis of turkey meat where treatment T2 presents the highest amount of protein, while treatment T3 presents the lowest amount of fat followed by the lowest amount of ash of treatment T2 with 1.04, therefore treatment T3 presents the highest amount of moisture. Souci et al. (2008) reported values of protein, fat, ash and moisture with 24.6, 0.65, 1.2 and 74.12 respectively, results that coincide with those obtained in this research. Jun et al. (2015) reported 1.11 ash in turkey meat, while Frank et al. (2018) in his study obtained a value of 21.8 protein in improved turkeys.\n\nOrganoleptic characteristics of turkey meat\n\nMeat texture\n\nAccording to the data obtained regarding the texture of the meat in treatment T1, we have as a result that, of the total number of panelists, 40% indicated that they like it very much, while 42% responded that they like it, therefore, 18% indicated that they neither like it nor dislike it. As for treatment T2, we found that 44% of the responses indicated that they liked the texture very much, 40% indicated that they liked it, while 16% indicated that they neither liked nor disliked the texture. The results obtained for treatment T3 indicate that 50% of the panelists like the texture of the turkey meat in this treatment very much, while 36%, according to their criteria, indicate that they like the texture of this meat, however, 40% indicated that they neither like nor dislike it (see Table 10).\n\nMeat flavor\n\nThe data collected for T1, regarding the flavor of the meat, show that 16% of the panelists said they liked the flavor very much (see Table 11), while 58% indicated that they liked it, but 26% stated that they neither liked nor disliked the flavor. Regarding T2, the data obtained as a result of the organoleptic analysis survey, it can be seen that 46% indicated that they liked the flavor very much, however, 34% indicated that they liked it, therefore, 20% of the panelists were of the opinion that they neither liked nor disliked it. With respect to the analysis of T3, 54% of the panelists indicated that they liked the flavor very much, but 30% liked it, while 16% stated that they neither liked nor disliked it.\n\nMeat odor\n\nAccording to the data obtained from the survey conducted for the T1 sample, with regard to odor, it can be seen that 6% indicated that they liked it very much (see Table 12), while 32% of the panelists indicated that they liked it, however, 44% stated that they neither liked nor disliked it, while 18% indicated that they did not like the odor of the meat from this treatment. With respect to the T2 samples, the following results were obtained: 12% indicated that they like the smell of this meat very much, 36% indicated that they like it, therefore, the majority of the panelists, corresponding to 42%, indicated that they neither like nor dislike it, while 10% stated that they do not like the smell of turkey meat from this treatment. In T3, 22% indicated that they liked the odor very much, however, 44% of the panelists indicated that they liked the odor, 34% indicated that they neither liked nor disliked it, therefore, 8% considered that they did not like the odor of this meat. Regarding the color of the turkey meat in T1, 18% indicated that they liked it very much, 42% considered that they liked it, while 40% stated that they neither liked nor disliked it, as shown in (Table 13). In relation to T2, 28% indicated that they liked the color of the meat very much, while 46%, which is where most of the responses for this treatment are concentrated, considered that they liked the color, and 26% indicated that they neither liked nor disliked the color of the meat. In T3, 24% of the panelists indicated that they liked it very much, while 56% of the panelists stated that they liked the color of the meat, although 20% neither liked nor disliked it.\n\nMeat juiciness\n\nAccording to the data obtained from the analysis of the organoleptic characteristics in terms of juiciness of T1 meat, the result is that 2% of the panelists like it very much (see Table 14), 30% indicate that they like it, while the majority (68%) indicate that they neither like nor dislike the juiciness of this meat. Regarding T2, the results show that 12% of the panelists like the juiciness very much, while 38% indicate that they like it, however, it can be observed that 50%, which corresponds to the highest percentage, indicate that they neither like nor dislike it. The results obtained for T3, through the analysis of the responses of the panelists, show that 8% like the juiciness very much, while 34% indicate that they like it; therefore, 58% state that they neither like nor dislike the juiciness of the meat of this treatment.\n\nConclusions\n\nFeed intake, weight gain, feed conversion and carcass yield in T3 obtained the best productivity values, while in the control treatment the values were not very efficient in this research. The proximal analysis of the meat of the treatments showed that the highest percentage of protein was obtained in T2 with 24.8%; however, the lowest percentage of fat was in T3 with 0.60%, while in the analysis of ash the lowest values were found with 1.04% in treatment T2 and 73.94% humidity in treatment T1. The methodology applied in this research allowed obtaining a better quality meat, as demonstrated by the non-parametric statistical analysis of affectivity with hedonic scales of intensity of attributes, which determined that T3 presented the best organoleptic characteristics. The economic analysis carried out for each of the treatments under study in this research shows that T2 resulted in the highest profitability with a profitability of 99.56 % compared to the control treatment with a value of 88.63 %."
