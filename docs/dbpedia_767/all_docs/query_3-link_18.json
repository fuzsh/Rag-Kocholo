        "text": "Figure 4. Multivariable analysis for the maturity index (p<0.05) of the treatments concerning the days of storage. Chemistry Laboratory of the Universidad TÃ©cnica Estatal de Quevedo, Quevedo, Ecuador. November 2022.\n\nSensory characterization\n\nFor the sensory categories (color, aroma, flavor and acceptability), the level of preference and acceptance of treatments T1, T3 and T5 was determined, considering that T3 and T5 presented longer storage time of the strawberries (Table 3).\n\nThe results of the Kruskal Wallis test for the sensory parameter color presented a P-value of 0.1006, which showed no significant difference between the treatments evaluated. In addition, it was identified that the highest valuation, 4.00 Â± 0.80, was located in T3, placing it according to the score of the hedonic scale with the category \"I like it\". In contrast, T1 and T5 placed lower values with 3.40 Â± 0.72 and 3.20 Â± 1.10, respectively; the treatments presented a red and intense red.\n\nA significant difference was found for aroma with a P-value of 0.4107, where it was observed that the uncoated treatment (T1) obtained a higher score on the scale with 2.93 Â± 1.23 compared to T5, which had the lowest score with 2.47 Â± 0.98. It is worth mentioning that the tasters described the aroma of the fruit as slightly perceptible to moderately intense.\n\nConcerning the results for the flavor parameter, it can be observed that there was no significant difference between treatments, with a P-value of 0.7299. However, the Tukey multiple range test shows that T1 has a higher valuation for this sensory attribute with a mean of 4, 67 Â± 1.31, followed by T3 with 4.60 Â± 1.25 corresponding to the category \"I like it\" in contrast to T5, which obtained a lower valuation of 2.75 Â± 0.86, placing itself according to the hedonic scale score with the category \"Neither like nor dislike.\"\n\nThe level of acceptance of the treatments (Table 3) was not significant since a P-value of 0.6133 was obtained; however, using the multiple range test, it was identified that T1 presented the highest rating with a mean of 3.67 Â± 1.25, followed by T3, which presented a rating of 3.62 Â± 1.33. At the same time, T5 had the lowest rating, with 2.75 Â± 1.63, being less pleasant to the tasters.\n\nTable 3. Sensory characterization of treatments with longer shelf life than control treatment (uncoated strawberries). Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro de ManabÃ­, Manta, Ecuador. December 2022.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCoated strawberries showed an increase in Â°Brix content. However, their conservation was higher compared to the control. This increase is related to the fruit's starch and the coating composition, converted into simple sugar21. The Â°Brix represents the state of maturity of a fruit, i.e., the higher the Â°Brix content, the higher the degree of maturity, and for an acceptable flavor, a minimum of 7% soluble solids (Â°Brix) is recommended22. Applying edible coatings to rapidly degrading fruits slows the increase in Â°Brix compared to the control7.\n\nThe increase in pH is due to the consumption of organic acids during ripening and fruit senescence processes. It is also due to the binding of free pectic fragments in the cell wall with polyphenols during ripening processes. In addition, research on using edible coatings based on Tuna Agria mucilage determined pH values between 3.60 and 3.9824. On the other hand, when using a bioactive coating based on vegetable gelatin, sugar starch and cinnamon essential oil, the pH ranged from 5.50 to 6.7825.\n\nThe reduction of acidity is associated with fruit ripening. This can be verified by the values obtained in this study, which presented a behavior similar to those reported in blackberries treated with aloe vera and received acidity values of 1.16 to 0.9 g citric acid/100 g, as well as in blackberries coated with cinnamon oil and strawberries covered with penca mucilage 26. It is essential to mention that the maximum decrease can be 0.50, and this tendency is correlated with the increase in pH 27.\n\nThe values for the maturity index increased with the passage of days; the coating slows down the ripening process of the coated samples, which is a great advantage because it extends the shelf life of the fruit28. The results obtained in this research presented a similar behavior to those registered in \"Rio Red\" grapefruits waxed with commercial wax with 14 % of solids and methyl jasmonate 10-3 M in dissolved form presented a maturity index between 10.43 and 32.2529. Although the maturity index is not the only factor that determines if the strawberry has reached the end of its useful life, it is a significant value to establish a limit parameter to consider when evaluating the useful life of the fruit30.\n\nCoatings with a 2% concentration of Nisin are sensorially acceptable since they do not modify the original color of the fruit. On the other hand, some researchers determined that strawberries coated with propolis and soy protein allowed maintaining the red coloration in the coated fruits during the evaluation period and preserving the color in an effective way31. Also, the coating based on aloe vera, ethanolic extract of propolis and essential oil of orange had an effect in intensifying the brightness of tomatoes32.\n\nCoatings do not significantly influence the aroma of strawberries; according to research on coatings composed of whey protein isolate and concentrate in the hydrophilic phase and beeswax (BW) in the lipid phase, they do not affect the aroma of freshly cut coated fruits, being sensorially acceptable, i.e., they do not impart strange flavors or odors33. It is worth mentioning that there are also highly impermeable coatings that induce the creation of anaerobic conditions, causing, as a consequence, a loss of the typical aromatic compounds of the fruit and the presence of undesirable aromas. Therefore, it is essential to know the nature of the ingredients of the film or coating32.\n\nFruit ripening involves complex processes that cause significant changes in their sensory properties, such as flavor and texture, which directly influence the final product quality 33. On the other hand, when using tara gum in the postharvest quality of strawberries, there were no changes in the flavor, where the panelists mentioned that it does not confer any residual flavor; in this way, they were able to delay the senescence of the coated strawberries21.\n\nUsing 2% nisin in the coatings made it possible to obtain strawberries with an acceptable quality level similar to the uncoated strawberries; the coatings represent an effective alternative against quality damage, improving the shelf life during storage. Studies on the application of edible coatings showed that the general sensory acceptance for coated samples was higher than 70%, demonstrating that coatings could be applied without generating rejection problems in consumers 33. On the other hand, it is mentioned that the use of edible coatings on products submitted to osmotic dehydration presented favorable results in the level of acceptance of the samples34.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nApplying an edible coating based on milk protein and Nisin (2% and 6%) positively affected preserving physicochemical characteristics such as Â°Brix, pH, titratable acidity and maturity index. In addition, the addition of 2 % nisin had a significant influence on sensory traits: color, aroma, flavor and acceptability, presenting similar intensities to the treatment without coating, thus concluding that it can be used as an effective alternative during postharvest handling of strawberries and also contributing to the food industry with the development of a new packaging and protection technology for fruits, to replace conventional plastic and promote sustainable and sustainable development.\n\nFinally, another trend in the development of new coatings is the incorporation of healthy additives, including probiotics with the introduction of vitamins and minerals in fruits with a tendency to more significant degradation, such as blackberry, raspberry, papaya, and mango, among others.\n\nAuthor contributions: \"Conceptualization, GGA and VGT; methodology, KRE; software, KRE; research, TOC; writing-preparation of the original draft, JAM All authors have read and accepted the published version of the manuscript\".\n\nFunding: The present research is funded by the Universidad TÃ©cnica Estatal de Quevedo.\n\nConflicts of interest: \"The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest\".\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
