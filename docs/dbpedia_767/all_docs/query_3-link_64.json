Also within the framework of the event, a total of eight keynote speeches were imparted on current topics such as wearable technologies and their applications in medicine, sports and people’s well-being; Linux embedded system applications using Raspberry Pi; ethical hacking; the application of virtual models in the homologation of industrial products; the feasibility of using heat pumps assisted by solar energy; the integration of capacity planning and production in the industry; the optimal planning of heterogeneous wireless networks in applications of electrical networks and smart cities; the energy performance of battery and hybrid electric vehicles, among others.\n\nWORKSHOPS\n\nWORKSHOP 1: WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR MONITORING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: HOW TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY\n\nThe use of portable fitness devices (wearable technology) for sports, medical and wellness applications has grown considerably in the last decade. The increase in demand for these devices by the average consumer has resulted in a highly competitive market. Energy consumption, distance travelled, step counting, sleep monitoring, and heart rate are some of the measures provided by such devices through smartphone applications, which aim to promote physical activity in the people. However, most of these devices have been criticized due to their lack of accuracy, precision and reliability, which has caused some of them to disappear from the market. The objective of this workshop is to introduce the participant to the fascinating world of wearable devices. For this, we will use inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) with different characteristics. The workshop will include the following topics:\n\n• Introduction to the applications and specifications of wearable devices\n\n• Calibration and interpretation of inertial data (accelerometers and gyroscopes)\n\n• Acquisition of data and basic tools\n\n• Classification of physical activities\n\n• Integration and synchronization of inertial data with video tools\n\nTo take full advantage of this workshop, trainees must have basic knowledge of Matlab®.\n\nInstructor:\n\nPhD.

Systematic literature searches are usually developed with two objectives: (1) as the first phase of more complex research in order to know in depth a certain field of study, to develop a theoretical framework and to establish the appropriate assumptions to focus the investigation; and (2) as a methodology to be used in an empirical study when the objective is to analyze the publications to establish the state of the art in a certain subject (bibliometric study). In this context, as part of the workshop, we will present a five-phase scheme that will allow attendees to acquire basic skills for the development of a state of the art on the research subject of their interest. At the same time, general guidelines will be offered for the writing of bibliographic review articles.\n\nInstructor:\n\nPhD.

The use of these devices has increased in recent years due to the great diversity of applications in different sectors of the industry aimed at improving our quality of life. This conference will discuss different types of wearable technologies and how they are affecting our lives both positively and negatively. Likewise, some studies carried out at Griffith University in Australia will be presented, ranging from medical applications (such as radio systems through wearable antennas that allow monitoring and localization of endoscopic capsules for gastrointestinal tracing) to sports and wellness applications in which the wearable sensors composed of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers are used to obtain physiological parameters and promote physical activity in the general public, as well as to improve, ultimately, the performance of elite athletes.\n\nInstructor:\n\nPhD.

The test is performed to identify vulnerabilities to help prevent future external attacks. This conference will provide a step-by-step explanation of the hardware and software components necessary to set up a laboratory for pentesting practices, complying with three main characteristics: functional, nice-looking and affordable.\n\nInstructor:\n\nEng. Karina Astudillo B. – Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL), Ecuador\n\nKarina Astudillo is an IT Security Consultant, CEO of Consulting Systems, and also a professor at the Master’s program of Applied Computer Security (MSIA), the Master’s program of Management Information Systems (MSIG) and the CISCO Academy of Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL).

His books have been published in Spanish, English and Italian, and some of them are among the best-selling Amazon Books. Among them we would like to highlight: HACKING ETICO: ¡Cómo convertirse en hacker ético en 21 días o menos! (3ra. Edición, 2018); HACKING WIRELESS 101: Cómo hackear redes inalámbricas fácilmente (2017); 7 PASOS PARA SER UN PENTESTER (2017) y EMPRENDE EL NEGOCIO DE TUS SUEÑOS: Cómo ganar dinero haciendo lo que amas (2018).\n\nApplication of virtual models in the homologation of industrial products\n\nThis conference will summarize some of the knowledge developed at Instituto Universitario de Investigación del Automóvil Francisco Aparicio Izquierdo (INSIA) in the Polytechnic University of Madrid, applied to the homologation of products through virtual models. The homologation through virtual models is included among the test possibilities admitted in the Regulation 2007/46 /EC for motor vehicle homologation and its annexed trailers, systems, components and independent technical units (Framework Regulation). In this regulation, the homologation is admitted through virtual tests, in line with some other regulatory acts as Regulations 58, 66, 93 and 107 of United Nations, dedicated to safety conditions of large vehicles (passenger or merchandise). The virtual homologation of these vehicles and other safety components, such as the parachutes (emergency brakes) of the elevators, has different characteristics concerning those on the physical tests. In virtual trials, there is no change in the results, unless the procedure incorporates it. In the virtual tests, it would not be possible to verify the conformity of the production, or if possible, it would be difficult to attain the same results in a physical test for a product manufactured years after the virtual homologation. Therefore, in this talk, we will intend to share the reflections on the characteristics that a virtual essay oriented to the homologation of a product (especially road vehicles) must have, and how the parameters’ variation can be modelled to get a statistical outcome that allows obtaining the range of results in which a certain probability of success can be found.\n\nInstructor:\n\nPhD.

He has participated in 67 research projects, has directed two doctoral theses and published 14 articles in journals of high scientific impact, a book, five book chapters, 42 conference papers, and two patents. Currently, his research interest is focused on passive vehicle safety.\n\nSolar-assisted heat pumps: technological trends and feasibility in Ecuador\n\nThe scarcity of fossil resources and climate change are driving the development of more environmentally friendly renewable technological alternatives for both electricity and thermal energy generation. Among these solutions are the heat pumps that are used in the generation of thermal energy in various applications such as preparation of sanitary hot water, heating of pool water and food drying. Although this technology is mainly used in isolation using ambient air as the main source of heat, in recent years solar-assisted heat pumps have been developed that have proven great energy efficiency. This solar assistance can be based on solar thermal technologies, photovoltaic solar technologies or even both of them. In this context, the conference will address the new technological trends of these systems and analyze the feasibility of their use in Ecuador.\n\nInstructor:\n\nPhD. Jesús López Villada – Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Ecuador\n\nProfessor López Villada has a Doctorate in Air Conditioning and Energy Efficiency Technologies in Buildings from the Rovira i Virgili University (URV) of Tarragona, Spain. He is currently a professor and researcher in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Escuela Politécnica Nacional (EPN) in Quito, Ecuador. He has worked as an energy consultant for the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GIZ) and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture (IICA). Also, he has participated as a researcher in Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency projects at the National Institute of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy of Ecuador (INER). Before his current position, he worked as a professor and researcher at the Rovira i Virgili University, researching on air conditioning and solar cooling systems and teaching in the Master’s program in Renewable Energies, and in the Doctorate and Master in Air Conditioning Technologies and Energy Efficiency in Buildings, as well as in different engineering degree programs. He is the author of more than 30 highly cited publications related to energy efficiency, renewable energy and refrigeration.\n\nIntegration of capacity and production planning in the two-stage process industry\n\nIn industrial sectors with high capital intensity, immobilized productive resources degrade over time, leading to an increase in unit production costs or a loss of capacity. In this context, companies need to constantly monitor the conditions of their productive assets and plan maintenance activities to recover their performance and remain competitive. In addition, the replacement of productive assets at the end of their lifespan must be carefully planned to avoid shortages of products to customers due to large periods of unavailability, being, in turn, a perfect opportunity to adjust the production capacity. Thus, in favour of an improvement in the competitive position of these companies, there is a need to simultaneously plan capacity, production and maintenance decisions taking into account the associated costs, periods of inactivity, as well as the optimization of the new production capacity. However, traditionally these problems have been addressed separately both in the scientific community and in practice. In this talk, the potential benefits obtained associated with a real case of a two-stage process industry through the use of mathematical programming will be illustrated.\n\nInstructor:\n\nPhD. Manuel Díaz-Madroñero – Universitat Politècnica de València, España\n\nManuel Díaz-Madroñero is a titular professor in Operations Management and Operations Research at Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) and member of the Research Centre on Production Management and Engineering (CIGIP).

His key research topics include production and transportation planning, fuzzy and robust mathematical programming, multiobjective optimization and sustainable operations management.\n\nOptimal planning for deployment of heterogeneous wireless networks in applications of electric networks and smart cities\n\nIn the framework and concept of intelligent electrical networks, certain stages are determined so that a smart grid can be considered; therefore, the advanced measurement infrastructure (AMI) destined to transport information in a bidirectional way between the electric meter and the electricity companies, requires the deployment of a communications network with a reduced cost from the use of a heterogeneous wireless network that through multi-jump allows the connectivity of smart meters, concentrators, base stations, and electrical companies. Starting from this premise, the study of the massive deployment of sensors is no longer of sole importance for the AMI but the same problem is transferred to the field and concept of smart cities that require the deployment of several sensors with wireless communication to provide different services to citizens to improve their quality of life. Thus, the real design criteria of a wireless sensor network must contemplate multiple variables and from an optimization model, the proximity to a lower-cost solution can be achieved while guaranteeing the efficiency and reliability of the communications network destined to certain services.\n\nInstructor:\n\nPhD.

The first refers to a hybrid powertrain with a fuel cell that corresponds to an extended-range electric vehicle. This system includes two energy storage sources: a lead-acid battery pack with a capacity of 5.04 kWh, and a hydrogen bottle stored in metal hydrides with a 200 W power polymer membrane fuel cell. The second powertrain configuration refers to a pure electric vehicle powered by batteries. In the latter case, we have chosen lithium-iron-phosphate batteries with a capacity of 324 kWh. To obtain the results, experimental measurements of driving cycles with their corresponding height profiles have been used. The performance of the vehicles has been raised and a simulation model has been developed with a software tool for each type of drive train configuration. In this way, energy and fuel consumption data have been obtained through each driving cycle. The final part of the conference will show the results from two points of view. The hybrid fuel cell configuration is suggested as an energy solution to a specific mobility application, while the pure electrical configuration is more focused on sustainable mobility in the urban environment.\n\nInstructor:\n\nPhD.
