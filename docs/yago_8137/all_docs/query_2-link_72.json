        "text": "Under new agreements, the top-ranking series, along with its fan-favorite spinoff, Unspooled, remain at Earwolf, SiriusXM’s comedy podcast studio\n\nNEW YORK – December 12, 2022 - SiriusXM today announced multi-year extensions with two of its most beloved film podcasts: How Did This Get Made?, the award-winning and top-ranking comedy show hosted by Paul Scheer, June Diane Raphael, and Jason Mantzoukas; and Unspooled, the fan-favorite companion series co-hosted by Paul and film critic Amy Nicholson.\n\nThe new agreements keep both shows at Earwolf, SiriusXM’s comedy podcast studio, where they will continue to be produced and distributed. SXM Media, the combined advertising sales group of Sirius XM Holdings Inc., will maintain exclusive global ad sales rights to How Did This Get Made? and Unspooled.\n\nOn each episode of How Did This Get Made?, Paul, June, and Jason watch and deconstruct some of the best worst films ever made in what Vulture calls “a true celebration of cinema.”\n\nSince launching in 2010, How Did This Get Made? has grown to 40 million downloads per year, garnering praise as one of the best podcasts by The New York Times, Variety, Esquire, and Good Housekeeping, and regularly ranking in the top 50 comedy shows on Apple Podcasts. Earlier this year, the show took home the Ambie Award for Best Comedy Podcast, and the iHeartRadio Podcast Award for Best TV & Film podcast.\n\nUnspooled features Paul and Amy discussing the greatest movies of all time to find out what makes these classics so special. Collider has called the show “proof that it can be just as fun to talk about some of the best movies ever made.” Since launching in 2018, the series has been downloaded over 23 million times, and has been named one of year’s best podcasts by Esquire and Rolling Stone.\n\nIn a joint statement, Paul, June and Jason said: “Twelve years ago, Earwolf believed in us before anyone even knew what a podcast was, and so we are thrilled to continue our relationship with them. They have seen us through conversations about rock and roll ninjas, boyfriends who have turned into T-Rexes, and one of the most important debates of our time: ‘Team Sanity’ or ‘Team Fred.’ We are so excited to continue to build the show. GEOOOSTORM!!!!!”\n\n“June, Paul and Jason helped pioneer the podcasting space with a show that is both incredibly funny and insightful,” says Scott Greenstein, SiriusXM's President and Chief Content Officer. “For over a decade, their chemistry has turned what started as a simple concept into millions of listeners, sold out shows across the country, and a thriving business that includes merchandising and two spinoff series. We’re honored that we can continue to call SiriusXM’s Earwolf studio their home.”\n\nIn addition to How Did This Get Made?, June co-hosts The Deep Dive, a comedy podcast in which she and Jessica St. Clair discuss a wide range of topics, such as self-care, family, feminism, motherhood, and more, through conversations that Mic says “mirrors the natural intimacy of a FaceTime with your best friend.”\n\nNew episodes of The Deep Dive, Unspooled and How Did This Get Made? will continue to be available every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, respectively, on the Stitcher and SXM apps, as well as all major podcast listening platforms.\n\nAbout Sirius XM Holdings Inc.\n\nSiriusXM is the leading audio entertainment company in North America with a portfolio of audio businesses including its flagship subscription entertainment service SiriusXM; the ad-supported and premium music streaming services of Pandora; an expansive podcast network; and a suite of business and advertising solutions.
