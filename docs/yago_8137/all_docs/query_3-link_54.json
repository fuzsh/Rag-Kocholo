        "text": "“I would say that I am a traveler,” says Paul Scheer, who is also a comedian, actor, producer, writer, and podcaster extraordinaire. Because of work, he’s very often on the road—until the pandemic, of course. “I was telling my wife [fellow comedian, actress, writer, and podcaster June Diane Raphael] yesterday: This is the first time in our lives that we’ve spent this much time together, because between the two of us I don’t think there’s more than four weeks that go by without one of us leaving town. My whole career and life have been built around this idea of getting on a plane.”\n\nWhile locked down in his Los Angeles home, Scheer’s career has hardly slowed down. Aside from releasing regular episodes of his podcasts How Did This Get Made (about terrible movies) and Unspooled (about great movies) and appearing on Showtime’s Black Monday, he directed and appears in an episode of the Marvel 616 documentary, out November 20 on Disney+, and recently released a creator’s cut of the Aliens Vs. Parker comic series on the Macroverse app. He chatted with Condé Nast Traveler about an amazing anniversary trip, his relationship to Disney World, and how he yearns to pack again.\n\nHis most recent vacation:\n\nWe rented a house in Ojai for a month, which was actually incredibly lovely. I didn't realize how the change of scenery could make such a tremendous difference. And then, to escape the terrible wildfire burning—as that smell was coming in, it was hard for kids to get outside—we drew a line on a map and looked at where the smoke stopped affecting people, and so we got to Arizona and stayed at a house there.\n\nThe magical final trip he took before lockdown:\n\nMy wife and I took a trip right before lockdown, and that was to celebrate our anniversary. We've been married for 10 years, and we did a big trip: we went out to Blackberry Farm. Our anniversary is in October, but we celebrated it this year in late February, early March. I knew I wanted to do something really good for 10 years. A friend of mine heard me lamenting and stressing about it, and he's like, \"Dude, Blackberry Farm. Go there. It's magical.\" We went horseback riding; we went to whiskey tastings; they have five-star restaurants on their property. You're in little houses with fireplaces. They raise a special kind of dog there, beautiful Lagotto dogs. And then there's free snacks all around, pretzels and popcorn. It was like being in some sort of large, palatial mansion, and you get to have access to everything. We had an amazing time.\n\nHis somewhat intense packing strategy:\n\nI overpack. I have three bags with me at all times. I have a travel bag that is all toiletries. I have one that's just like, \"Okay, I'm going to be gone for a weekend\"—it's already pre-packed, it's got the right amount of contact lenses in it, it's got the travel sizes of everything ready to go. That's the carry-on one. Then if I'm going to be there for a little bit longer of a time, like a week, then I have a bigger toiletry bag, and that's got the bigger sizes because I know I can pack them. And then I have my electronics bags. [If] we're doing a tour for How Did This Get Made, I have all my hookups and things that I need in case of an emergency. Whenever you're going on stage and there's any sort of tech, you have to expect the unexpected. So now I'm traveling around with like a Scarlett box and a microphone, and ring lights—basically like a little mini studio. And when I go for a long time, I have a box; it sits in my garage and it essentially is my travel box. That has extension cords, power strips, alarm clock, Bluetooth speaker, that kind of stuff, when I'm really in it to win it. I shot a movie in Atlanta and in Vancouver and if you're there for two or three weeks, I want all that sort of stuff.\n\nHow he spends his flight time:\n\nIf I'm going on a major, major, major flight, sleep is the prime thing that I am focused on. I'm looking at the time of the place that I'm going, so I set my sleep schedule to that. I have all my things there to help facilitate that: headphones that noise-cancel, and this app that I love, a sound app that creates different kinds of musical patterns. Then when I'm normally traveling and just having fun, this is a chance for me to start bingeing a show. If I was traveling right now, I probably would have watched all of Schitt’s Creek or The Boys. Oftentimes I don’t get a chance to watch everything that I need to watch, because I’m watching a movie for Unspooled or How Did This Get Made. My viewing time is accounted for.\n\nWhat he’s listening to these days:\n\nMy car is podcast central. It's been really rough because of the pandemic, that podcast time, my Howard Stern time, is completely diminished. I'm simply not in my car. But right now I've been obsessed with Whistleblower. It's all about the NBA ref scandal, which is incredibly fascinating. It really blows me away. I have my staples, right? I love Reply All, Hollywood Handbook, The Doughboys, Blank Check, The Watch. When the NBA is on, I have my seven Clippers podcasts that I jump between. Sometimes I'll go in these wormholes; I listen to Binge Mode, where they'll break down a certain thing in binge mode, like all the Star Wars. They have a great new comedy podcast called Bonanas for Bonanza, with Andy Daly, one of the funniest guys. Then the podcast that I told the most people about before pandemic, that I'm absolutely obsessed with, was Dead Eyes, by Connor Ratliff. He was cast in the HBO show Band of Brothers, and then brought in to meet Tom Hanks and promptly fired. He was told that Tom Hanks thought he had dead eyes. So basically, it's him trying to find out why Tom Hanks thinks he has dead eyes. He talks to all these amazing people, like Seth Rogen, Tony Hale. It's a lot of funny actors talking about auditions, and when they don't go your way, and how they change your life. It really is such an amazing podcast.\n\nThe most memorable trip he’s ever taken:\n\nThe best vacation I think I've ever been on has been with my dad. My parents were divorced, and so we spent a lot of time just going on all these trips—Disney World in Florida, colonial Williamsburg. We had so much fun together. And last year I was able to pay it back to him. I took him on this trip to Tokyo, and being in my forties now, to have that one-on-one time with my dad—no kids, no wife, no anything—it was truly magical. Not only we were in an amazing country that I'm completely obsessed with, that I'd never gone to before, that he'd never gone to, but I was able to really treat him to a really higher-end experience. It meant the world to me.\n\nHow he usually plans vacations now:\n\nI have a six-year-old and four-year-old right now, and when they were a little bit younger, we all went to Disney World together. It was just so fun to go there with my kids; Disney World has been such a part of my life, for better or for worse. My parents only knew how to take vacations at Disney World. At one point, I was going out with my girlfriend at the time and she was like, \"Where do you want to go on vacation?\" And I'm like, \"Well, Disney World. That's the only place to go.\" I've now grown out of that, but it was so fun to go there with the kids. Watching fireworks, finding ice cream—to enjoy that as a parent was just an unbelievable experience.\n\nThe most underrated destinations he thinks more travelers should see:\n\nI went to Dakar and did some work there for a charity group called Malaria No More; I spent a week deep in the forests and jungles of northwestern Africa, and it was amazing. I got to go to Iran and Iraq on a USO tour and we were very lucky to go and experience that culture. We got to walk around these flea markets, see this amazing artistry, the shops, the food. They wouldn't be your first thought of places to go, but I mean, those two places absolutely blew my mind."
