        "text": "The actor and comedian June Diane Raphael has starred in television shows as varied as “The Bachelor” spoof “Burning Love,” and “Grace & Frankie.” Co-written with the author Kate Black, her book, “Represent: The Woman’s Guide to Running for Office and Changing the World,” will be published Sept. 3.\n\nMs. Raphael has two children with her husband, Paul Scheer, the actor. A vacation with children is, she says, “a work trip.”\n\n“One with tons of enjoyment and fun, but I’ve had to really divorce myself from the word ‘vacation’ because it implies something that is relaxing and luxurious, and when you have small children and you’re traveling, there’s just so much grit and hard work that goes into it.”\n\nWhen she gets a chance, she loves to head to the most decadent hotel she can find; she treats herself to one every Mother’s Day.\n\n“I love the Four Seasons, I love the Peninsula. I love being in a robe. I am the person who will use every amenity offered to me and provided to me. I want to go to the gym, I want to go to the spa, I need a service, I will be in every hot tub, I will be in it all.”\n\nHere’s what she can’t travel without.\n\nAn Away suitcase\n\n“I do love those Away suitcases. I can’t say enough about this bag. To me it’s just a smooth operator, I just enjoy the sensory experience.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
