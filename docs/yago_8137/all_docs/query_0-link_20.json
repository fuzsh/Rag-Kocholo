        "text": "Paul Scheer originally had some reservations about a chapter in his forthcoming book.\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE at a Los Angeles party for his new essay collection, Joyful Recollections of Trauma, on May 16, the comedian, 48, shared that there was a chapter that he was initially hesitant to include.\n\n“The one chapter I struggled with the most was the ADHD chapter that's at the end because it was something that I got diagnosed with as an older person, as a person with a child,” he said.\n\nThe Veep actor said that both his publisher and his wife, Grace and Frankie star June Diane Raphael, encouraged him to include the section in the essay collection, which details the ways his childhood experiences have impacted his life.\n\n“She's like, ‘It's the first time I feel like I understood you, like I understood what having your issue is like,'\" Scheer said of Raphael. \"And it's been odd because it's the one thing that I've told really no one.\"\n\nDespite how difficult it was for Scheer to write that part of the book, he recalled that early readers were impacted impacted by the chapter, and that they told him it spoke to them.\n\n“That was really hard for me, to be that vulnerable, because I think it's still fresh with me, whereas the other stuff was a little bit more dealt with on some level,” he said. “And then I realized that what I respond to in any kind of art, whether it's film, TV or books, is that personal thing, that journey. And it's like my book isn't prescriptive in any way, but it is personal.”\n\n“I felt like I realize now I like that chapter being in it because I'm like, ‘Oh, if I would've read that chapter, I might have checked myself out if someone else wrote it,’” he added. “And really, that's how I found out that I had ADHD, was [by] reading other people's dealing with it. So that was something that was really hard for me to be out there with, but also I'm now proud that it's there.”\n\nFamily also plays a prominent role in Scheer’s book, as the actor said that he dedicates the book to his parents, as well as his wife and their sons, Gus and Sam.\n\n“They challenge me in the best ways and they bring me to a place that does make me better, that I want to be a great parent to them,” Scheer said of his kids. “I know I'm going to have faults. I know I'm going to make a mistake, but they make me want to be a person that is aware…they make me want to be better.”\n\n“I don't think I could have written this book without being a father because that perspective of being a father allowed me to look at my childhood differently, and I think has colored how I treat them and how I am with them,” he continued.\n\nScheer added that writing his book ultimately became a way to see how far he’s come in his life and career.\n\n“I think the reason why I was able to write this book now was because of the work I did,” he says. “I didn't treat the book [as] my therapy as much as a reflection of the work that I've done on myself, so I was able to feel comfortable.”"
