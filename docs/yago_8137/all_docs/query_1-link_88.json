        "text": "Doug hates candy wrappers, screaming babies, sticky seats with 50 ads and popcorn kernels in his teeth. There's still not one that he won't see, cause Doug loves movies. Hey everybody, my name is Doug and I love movies. This is Doug Loves Movies, coming to you from the Earwolf Studios in Los Angeles on Thursday, December 15th to Ocean's 11. Cyrus is at the wheel on today's show. Matt Belknap is on vacation and Sam Levine is on assignment. Neither of those guys are those things. I just like saying that. I think that's just a fun broadcasting thing to say all the time.\n\nWest Palm Beach Improv improv i love you fun show tuesday night graham elwood chose a dude named jeremy with a ghostbusters theme name tag and jeremy picked in theaters now for his category in the leonard malton game and the clues were joyful and simplicity is the key to the film's success and then j Jeremy said four names, and Graham said, name it like a fool, because the four names were Emily Blunt, Sarah Silverman, Zach Galifianakis, and Alan Arkin. Who doesn't know the answer at this point? It's the Muppets. So Jeremy won a bunch of prizes.\n\nAnd I love Florida, South Florida, so much that i'll be back on january 18th at the improv in miami be sure to check out the fake sanitize me trailers on youtube type in sanitize me in the search engine and tweet me which ones are your faves impartial judges only no friends of the filmmakers please this isn't a bomb doug's reply at replies with the same message over and over again contest this is a which one does doug like the best contest um and i don't want to make sure i i want to make sure i don't overlook any of any you know any entries so be sure to let me know that you submitted one and thank you to everyone who submitted a trailer. There ended up being maybe 50 of them. That might be an exaggeration.\n\nBut 40-ish? The winner will be announced on the 12 Guests of Christmas episode plopping next week. Now it's time for Watch This, Not That. The number one movie in the country is New Year's Eve. I haven't seen it. The number two movie is The Sitter. Haven't seen it. So watch The Sitter, not New Year's Eve.\n\nWatch This, Not That. The number two movie is The Sitter. Haven't seen it. So watch The Sitter, not New Year's Eve. This has been... Watch this, not that. I say The Sitter looks more compelling just based on what I know about it. And it's the last chance to see Fat Jonah Hill, which is fun to celebrate that he lost all that weight. I'm doing everything I can to bring Doug Loves Movies to you. Upcoming road editions of Doug Loves Movies are happening in Burbank at Flappers\n\non December 20th at 10 p.m. Las Vegas at the Palace Station on January 8th. Sacramento at the Punchline January 14th. The Weezer Cruise from Miami to Cozumel on January 19th to 23rd. And the Vancouver Comedy Festival February 18th. Go to Douglovesmovies.com for links to all of these\n\nvarious podcast tapings and stand-up shows. Can you believe all that? It's a lot. That I'm doing? It's ridiculous. That Weezer cruise is going to be a lot of fun. Oh, that's just the sickest thing. Dinosaur Jr., Gene Ween. Do you think that Dinosaur Jr., Gene Ween.\n\nDo you think that Dinosaur Jr. is upset that they don't have their own cruise? I don't know. I think it could be a stepping stone to their own cruise, but still such a fun gig to go and do. What is the audience of the Weezer cruise? I don't know. I haven't done it yet. What do you think it is going to be? I'm thinking families, maybe.\n\nI'm thinking people that. Like indie rock families? Well, people that were, you know, going out and listening to bands and buying CDs and stuff when Weezer broke. Right. Yeah. Like the Blue Album and Pinkerton. That's like 91, 93.\n\nI mean, I know so many people my age and a little bit younger that Pinkerton is still like their favorite Pinkerton's a great album I was so bummed when I couldn't see their show where they were performing all of Pinkerton here in LA they perform on Thanksgiving weekend they do them back to back nights sometimes where they do the blue album one night and I was in New York when they were there\n\nand I could only go on the blue album night still went had a great time but the whole time Pinkerton I had Pinkerton in my mind the whole time, Pinkerton. I had Pinkerton in my mind the whole time because I love that album so much. But they're going to do the same thing on the cruise. They're going to play both albums. And they're going to do, as the cruise sets off into the sunset the first day, they play a show on the top of the ship.\n\nAnd everyone just crowds around on the deck of the ship. People sitting in the jacuzzis and stuff. Have they done this before? I only know all this because I was on the 311 cruise with that band and tons of other bands. And that crowd, turns out, they have a very young following. That crowd was just a bunch of young potheads. Did you have a good time? Very nice people. I was going to say, so you had nothing in common with them?\n\nNothing at all. Well, yeah. It was a good time? Very nice people. I was going to say, so you had nothing in common with them? Nothing at all. Well, yeah. It was a fantastic time. So that's part of why. So then when Weezer comes along, a band that I really like, 311 a lot. Yeah. But going on the cruise and then going to some of their shows recently have given me newfound love and respect for them.\n\nI've always liked them. But Weezer is a band that I used to follow around. You know, like when they were in L.A. and the Blue Album hadn't come out yet, I was seeing them at shows in various, you know, places of all different sizes, many of which are closed now. But I was like a real Weezer. Like I was the one, it was, I kind of took a little bit of credit for their initial success in a very, very haphazard sort of way because I turned\n\non Janine Garofalo to them and she did an interview with like some magazine with a shirt on that said, I love Weezer. Oh, wow. And she was sort of the first kind of celebrity to come out on their behalf. I think that's actually a very clean line. I feel like you can take credit. I can get a little bit of, yeah, I can get some of that. I can take a piece of it.\n\nAnd now they're paying you back by putting you on that cruise. Because we went to some weird music convention where they were just handing out a lot of samples and I found this one sample cassette. It was on a cassette. It was just the four songs from Weezer. It was the Sweater song, Buddy Holly, My Name is Jonas,\n\nand one other eventual hit from that album. That album was a fucking hit machine. Rick Ocasek. I believe that Rick Ocasek was the reason for that album being so great, too. I mean, everything on there was so... But then they did Pinkerton without him, and it was amazing. But it was not a critical success.\n\nIt's a great album, though. Yeah, well, it was one of those... I'm sure you guys talk about... I'm going to introduce you in a second. But we all love movies, and so – well, I don't know what my point was going to be about movies. But we should – this installment of Doug Loves Movies should be indie rock. It should be Doug Loves Indie Rock, and we should just talk about indie rock bands. So far, we could – I'm just excited about doing the cruise, trying to help sell the idea because the economy\n\nis not the greatest time for people to go on cruises right now, but the deals are pretty good. I think it's on Groupon, maybe. Oh, really? I think so. I feel like I would go on that cruise. It would be really fun. How long is it?\n\nHow many days? It's just four nights. It's out of Miami. That's nothing. That's an easy cruise. Yeah. Yeah. If you take a red eye on Wednesday, you could be back home in los angeles by noon on monday that's great if you're in new york there's no reason why you shouldn't be going boat goes all\n\nthe way to cozumel two days of just being on the boat which is uh the weather will be fantastic and there's always nonsense going on 24 7 are they on you drinking gambling can you smoke do people get high i bet a, a bunch of them? It's very much against the rules of international waters and whatnot. Yeah, so I don't do it at all. Are you worried at all about- I've also got something in my eye, you guys. Oh, uh-oh.\n\nWow. I can't quite see the shake. Because you're blinking it. You're winking it at us. Do you play casino games on the boat, too? Yeah, yeah. I'll just sit at a poker table for hours. And the whole time it's like you're playing and you're moving like this.\n\nIt's so – it's such a weird – The one family cruise I went on, I like went to our family room halfway through dinner. And there were two guys cleaning the room who were holding my underwear and my sister's underwear. I just remember walking in. I was like 11 years old. Like, what is this? I have a similar cruise memory scar. Like just holding, like, I mean,\n\ntiny girl's underwear. But like, were they folding or just holding? Well, there would be no reason to fold her underwear, Doug. They're picking them up off the floor, maybe? Did you leave him on the floor? No, they were in the drawer. My terrible scar from a cruise was\n\nI didn't know that my father's friend was wearing a toupee. I never knew that. I was bad at recognizing that sort of thing. And we came home late one night and the father was mad he popped out of bed without a toupee on totally bald like mr clean he's like what the hell are you guys doing it's four in the morning and the i freaked out because to see someone without\n\nhair after seeing them with hair for years i was like I ran backwards into the door to escape like a Scooby Doo moment because I thought it was like a weird stranger and as he was yelling at us he grabbed his toupee which was like thrown on the floor like a baseball hat or a pair of socks and he just picked it up and threw it on his head and he was like get up to bed but that is the memory I always have\n\nhe needed his hair for that last moment but Mr. Clean yelling at us and then you walked in the next day and there were two gentlemen in there in the room and they were holding his hair for that last moment. But Mr. Clean. And then you walked in the next day and there were two gentlemen in there. They were holding his hair. They were totally fondling his hair. My guests today are the whole gang from Earwolf's very popular How Did This Get Made podcast, which I will finally be appearing on. Yes, very excited.\n\nVery excited. I'm going to be on it soon, if not already. Yes, very excited. super fun already um but let me ask you guys about your podcast because each episode is dedicated to a different film yes that you you either you all you don't necessarily all go watch it together you just all sort of have the homework of having to see the only one we've seen all together i think is sucker punch yeah which was an amazing experience with chelsea peretti yeah that movie is awesome have you you seen it? Oh, and your guest also. Yes.\n\nSo all four of you went. We all went. Because every week it's the three of you and then a guest. I think we saw Wicker Man together too. We saw Wicker Man together. Oh, yeah. That was at somebody's home entertainment center. And then also Old Dogs. Old Dogs, the best worst movie of all time.\n\nBecause our show can kind of go two ways. Like how did this get made? It's two ways. Like how did this get made? It's so terrible. Or how did this get made? Because it's fucking crazy. Like Fast Five or Crank 2. Like those are in the good side category. And then there's the bad ones.\n\nWhere you have fun talking about movies where logic is swept aside. Exactly. To varying degrees of success. Yeah. Because you can have a Speed 2 cruise control. Yeah. That's ridiculous. And you can have a Speed 2 cruise control. Yeah. That's ridiculous. And you can have a Fast 5 that's ridiculous.\n\nYeah. But they end up getting an absolutely mixed, totally opposite reaction. Yeah. Even though they're both ridiculous. But one is like- One works and one doesn't work. Yeah. And Fast 5, I still say, was one of my favorite experiences at the movies.\n\nIt's a great movie. Yeah. It's so great movie. Yeah. It's so, I want to see more. I see, but the first time I saw it, I was sitting with a buddy at a matinee and not too many people in the theater, and it was really slow to me. I see. I was like, this is like one of the new classics. This is something that if it's on the TV while I'm doing something, I could really enjoy\n\nthis. Or while I'm on a treadmill or something. But the fact that I'm in a theater and there's so many other things I could be doing. And it's empty. Yeah, there's no excitement. But then I saw it again on my show that I do here in town from time to time\n\nwhere we sit in the front row with microphones. Which is so much fun. We've done a couple movies with you. There's a movie interruption, we call it. I did it without you there one time. And did anyone tell you this i had to run the doug benson movie game while you were not there because people were expecting it so you had to actually play it we did play it i roughly put it together with imdb and we were able to award some prizes that's awesome i love that you guys stepped up because my flight was I got screwed up with the travel thing\n\nBut I'm sorry You showed Fright Night Which if you've never seen Go see Fright Night The remake? The first one Whoa It's great\n\nYou really had a good time Oh yeah Jerry Dandridge But isn't Don't you think though That was my point about Fast Five Is it's just so much more fun To be sitting with some other comedians with an audience that's down with it.\n\nA hundred percent. And making fun of the movie while the boring parts are happening. I saw Fast Five on the midnight screening when it first came out, and the entire audience was cheering before the credits even rolled. And it was like half of it was not because it was like, this is going to be awesome. It was like, we're in for a crazy shit fest. Let's go. And it was like, half of it was not because it was like, this is going to be awesome. It was like, we're in for a crazy shit fest. Let's go. And everyone was, and that made the whole difference.\n\nLike, cheering at lines, high-fiving, it's great. Yeah, that's what those things kind of need. And I, unfortunately, I'm like a lot of people, I think, I'm not compelled to try to go to the movie theaters when i know there's going to be a crowd yeah no so we're not really seeing like random yeah i'm the opposite i really want there to be a crowd i want like that reaction i find so so you only go like on the weekends like friday saturday night well yes or i'll go like to nighttime screenings during the week. Like, cause usually, you know, here in the city, like those are still pretty well populated, but like I, I just saw twilight cause we're doing twilight, uh, spoiler alert, uh, alone,\n\nliterally a completely alone and was miserable because I kept wanting to turn to people and be like, what the fuck is going on? It's got some, I'm, that's a candidate for me to show at CineFamily because it's got it's, we'll get into this on your show but it's a series of chasms. It's just\n\nmiraculous that anyone is paying attention. I love every second of it. We'll talk about it later, you guys. I can't wait to talk about it. I love seeing movies. See, I feel uncomfortable going to see a movie alone when it's a packed theater. Oh, that's interesting. Like, I feel like a weird person.\n\nLike, I just feel like I'm weird. And I enjoy seeing them alone in the afternoons. You can slip into a good seat, though, if you're that loner at a crowded screening. Yeah, single seat. Like, I do that at film festivals, you know. I get in and get a good seat. though, if you're that loner at a crowded screening. Yeah, a single seat. I do that at film festivals. I get in and get a good seat because I'm all by myself. I love that. Yeah.\n\nI like seeing comedies in a packed theater. And then the other ones are – because I feel like then sometimes you'll see a comedy. If it's alone, it's not as funny for whatever reason. Oh, I think that's completely true. I want to see the artist with the packed house. I heard that's amazing. You know what I mean? I have a screener of it, but I haven't watched it.\n\nI actually don't think you should watch it. I want to watch it in the theater with people. The person I talked to today said it's amazing because the first couple moments of the artist, you hear everybody eating their popcorn. And then everyone slowly realizes, oh, we can't talk because there's no sound. And so everyone slowly stops eating and it's all just staring. It's a silent film. Yeah, it's really cool.\n\nI asked somebody, because I also saw Twilight this morning at 10.55 a.m. Like got out of my pajamas and like walked into Twilight. And there was a woman texting in front of me and I had to ask her to turn off her phone. Wait, was it that crowded? No, there was like four other people, but it's so, when I see she's so... It illuminates the room.\n\nIt illuminates the room, and she was holding it so far up. And I know she felt like there's only a few of us here. Right. This is okay. Yeah. And... That's a sucky attitude. I hate when people do that.\n\nI hate when people do that. And a group of three people come in. And they start talking. And they treat it like it's their private screening. But there's one other person there. No, I don't like that at all. Don't like that at all. I'm not a fan.\n\nAlthough I did yesterday when I was watching Twilight, I wanted to take a picture of Taylor Lautner's expression. I say expression because he only has one. And I did take a picture of it and I forgot to take off my flash. So in the middle of the movie, this flash came out of my phone. I felt pretty bad about that. Yeah, it's a good thing he physically turns into a wolf, because if he had to act like a wolf, he'd be in trouble.\n\nCGI really came in handy for him. Yeah, there's no transition between him and wolf. It's just him and then wolf. Save it for HDTGM. You know what was a great movie to see in the theater, by the way? I've been talking about it. There's a great movie I just saw in the theater, I guess a couple weeks ago, was Harold and Kumar, the Christmas movie. It was really good, and I feel like no one saw it.\n\nIt was like 3D. It was super fun. The stupidest timing to come out with people who are sick and tired of 3D and paying the extra surcharge or whatever. Yeah. And then they put it out in mid, mid November. Yeah. Before Thanksgiving.\n\nWhy would they do that? A Christmas movie. I think they were nervous about like competition, but it was, it's so funny. It's so good. And it was, that movie would have been number one against New Year's Eve.\n\nYes. If it had come out then, because all the young people would have gone. The box office for all movies was terrible last weekend because the people that spend the money on tickets are really preoccupied with Christmas right now. But young people, they don't got anything to do.\n\nSo you put out an R-rated comedy with Jonah Hill. What's that about? Why would anyone go to that? Is the sitter a comedy? Oh yeah, it's a sitter. I wish it wasn't a comedy. What did you think it was? From the poster,\n\nI thought it was like a weird, like, Cyrus type. No offense. Sorry, Cyrus. Like, Cyrus type, like. No offense. No offense to people\n\nnamed Cyrus. Cyrus, I'm so sorry. Is it spelled the same as the movie, Cyrus? Yeah. Yeah. Because that's how I wrote it down. When you said your name was Cyrus, I wrote down...\n\nC-Y-R-U-S, Cyrus. Spell it that same way, yeah. But it could be like... How else would you spell it? I'm curious. What are the other options? Well, maybe like S-Y, Cy. What do you mean, how else would you spell it?\n\nYou know, it's a... S-I-D-H-R-U-S. Yeah? Cyrus. Yeah. Cyrus. Yeah, I guess there really aren't a lot of ways to spell it. But I just mean that now I ask how do you spell it to anybody who wants me to write their name down on anything because all the wacky spellings that have been just in my mind.\n\nI guess I do that too with people. Yeah, people love to have a crazy spelling or like, you know, even like a Brian with a Y, you've got to ask first. Those people are trying too hard. Ryan with an I would be bad. Did you guys catch the Golden Globe nominations today? They came out today. I saw that there were some weird choices there. Hot topic.\n\nLike Matt LeBlanc got a nomination over... For episodes? For episodes, yeah. I hear he's great on that, though. I hear he's great, but I mean... like Matt LeBlanc got a nomination over for episodes episodes I hear he's great on that though I hear he's great but I mean I haven't heard of one person I know who's like\n\nreferenced the show episodes I don't know anybody who's seen it I hear that's good I saw I tried I watched one and I just didn't get it\n\nbut I've not gotten a lot of things that have turned out to be great is it a comedy I'm gonna ask this about everything it is\n\nit is it's kind of like a British I don't know it's based on. It is. It is. It's kind of... Like a British kind of comedy. I don't know. It's based on a British show. Yeah, and it's hard not to compare it to other things that are... Like, Matt LeBlanc's very low-key in it.\n\nIt's just like, I think he gets a lot of kudos just for... Not being Joey. ...being decent at not being Joey, but also being like a fictionalized version of himself that's not like a perfect person. But that said, I've only watched like one episode and I didn't really love it. Well, there's a little up version of himself that's not like a perfect person. But that said, I've only watched like one episode and I didn't really love it. Well, there's a little uproar about that and then there's also a little uproar about the fact that like Breaking\n\nBad got like no nominations. But like it was a weird... There's British stuff in every category and European stuff because it's an international group of people. It's not Americans that are voting on it. The Hollywood Foreign Press, which is apparently about 60 people. They speak English, all of them, but there's 75 of them.\n\nAnd it's, yeah, the reputation's been pretty bad in the past. But at least this year they have no The Tourist with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. Which you guys should have done on your show. We did. We did. Yeah, because the fact that they got nominated at all. It's that whole musical comedy category, though, that kind of opens it up for, well, we'll just nominate the most famous people that were in something that could possibly be considered\n\na musical or a comedy. It was neither that movie. No, no. It didn't fit into any genre. It should have just been, I mean, it was trying to be a thriller. But it didn't fit into any genre. It should have just been a... I mean, it was trying to be a thriller. But it didn't even do that. And that poor guy, they got to direct it, the von Habenschmecker.\n\nHe made that great movie. The Lives of Others. That was great. And then he just kind of got shoved into, now do this Hollywood thing. The stuntman that plays my stuntman on NTSF, he was the stuntman for Johnny Depp. He's in the movie\n\nand he does a bunch of stuff and he said that that director kind of was just out of his league in the sense that they would take, they took two days to shoot a scene\n\nwith Angelina Jolie walking across a courtyard. That was it. He's like, there was no dialogue, there was no action. You gotta get it right because it's such a serious movie.\n\nIt's not right. He kept on like, just a walk across the courtyard two days 24 hours that's crazy maybe there was just a language barrier there\n\nmaybe they just didn't we weren't asking for the right thing I also heard from another guy who worked on that movie that the director\n\ngave Johnny Depp a note and Johnny Depp said I'll do it that way but it's not gonna work. And then he did it. And I guess... So I feel like everyone kind of left that movie not really... Is that the movie that got shut down for a while\n\nbecause Johnny Depp was jaundiced from so much booze that he looked yellow? That's really weird because I feel like his skin coloring was off in that movie. Yeah, it was weird. I think that's they had to shut it down and clean his system. That's really weird because I feel like his skin coloring was off in that movie. Right? Yeah, it was weird.\n\nYeah, it was weird. I think that's the movie they shut it down for a while to detox him because he was just turning yellow. His acting choice in that movie was to make no choices whatsoever. It was a weird movie. It's just like this guy sort of stumbling through a leading role in a motion picture. He was like his first time doing it or something so weird bizarre but i'm glad that moneyball got uh in there for best drama they picked like six movies which i don't i don't get why they have to go that far\n\nand they still left out some movies that people think should be in there like tree of life which i have not seen but now 50 50 is in the comedy category yeah which makes it nice that at least it got in there somehow. Yeah. Because that movie, super underrated. Super underrated. But it doesn't feel like, I mean, I guess like when you think comedy. It's a comedy. I guess it's a comedy, yeah. Seth Rogen has especially one particular scene that's very funny.\n\nUltimately, I feel like, yeah, it would wind up in, it would be, it would stand out in the drama category. Right. You're right. Maybe you're right. In a perfect world, there wouldn't be a division between comedy and drama. Here we go, Doug. Here he goes.\n\nIn an even more perfect world, the comedies would get the credit they deserve. Guys, all I'm going to say is I'm hosting the Critics' Choice Movie Awards January 12th. Oh, God. Here we go. And we're just going to give out. They've got a lot of categories. They've got a lot of categories. Best Action. Yeah. Best Comedy. Best Five is going to win that, right? Yeah. Best Five is nominated. one and we're gonna we're just gonna give up they got a lot of categories got a lot of category best\n\naction yeah that's comedy fast five's gonna win that yeah that's five is nominated best if we have i wonder if you're gonna meet like it in doing that a lot of people that we've done movies about that we've done like they're oh i'm sure i'm sure i'm i regret that'll be interesting hopefully it's gonna get ugly for you guys hopefully they understand that they are they're not wasn't it judd who recently said uh jud't it Judd who recently said that there should be an Oscar category for best comedy? Yeah, there should be. There absolutely should be. It's crazy that there isn't.\n\nBut then that's the problem is that then once you divide them, then a great comedy that should just be regarded as a great movie. Or they should just be nominated at all. Like Bridesmaids is getting these nominations from SAG and from the Critics' Choice and then there's another one, the Golden Globes. Yeah. Bridesmaids got nominated all of them\n\nbut that's because they all have a comedy category. But it's true. But that movie's one of the five or ten best movies of the year, period. But it's like you will never put\n\nBridesmaids up in the Oscars because like, oh, that's not... Even with ten movies. But it's so... Even now that they've... Well, it's not ten anymore. Oh, that's not. Even with 10 movies. But it's so. Even now that they've. Well, it's not 10 anymore.\n\nOh, it's not? Now they've got a new system where it could be anywhere from 5 to 10. Based on how many votes certain movies. It sounds like another crazy thing to just try to. They just don't want to ace out that Avatar or Titanic or Dark Knight. Dark Knight is what it was. They don't want to push out the movie that's going to get people to watch. And guess what?\n\nThis year it's Bridesmaids and it's not going to make the cut because it's such a flat out comedy. But I feel like that's the same thing that happened with Hangover. I mean, Hangover was nominated, I think, the same way as Best Picture. But Hangover, there's a mixed reaction to by... Yeah, I guess you're right. Bridesmaids is pretty much... I've got to say, though, in Bridesmaids there's a bunch reaction to by... Yeah, I guess you're right. Bridesmaids is pretty much... I gotta say, though, in Bridesmaids, there's a bunch of moments that...\n\nIt's such a funny movie, but there's some moments in there that aren't in Hangover or anything on the level of Bridesmaids. Like when Kristen Wiig is eating that cupcake that she makes herself. Oh, that's a terrific... That's a beautiful moment.\n\nA beautiful sequence, yeah. And beautifully acted. And you don't necessarily see that moment in a hangover or another well I mean will Midnight in Paris get nominated\n\nbecause I mean it's when you see Ken Jeong's oh I'm sorry when he jumps out of the trunk it's the same thing as making a cupcake alone it's that same moment\n\nof self reflection and self discovery but don't you think that also like it's weird that a movie like Midnight in Paris might get nominated\n\nfor best picture of the year but yet because Woody Allen even though it's a flat out, I mean, it is a comedy, but Woody Allen gets this pass where his movies get nominated for Best Picture. I think that'll be one of those things where it either gets nominated for Screenplay or Director and not Best Picture. I love that movie. That movie was great. See, that's where Screenplay is the Academy's equalizer in terms of comedies, because they can nominate ten, they have to do five dramas and five comedies.\n\nSo that's where young adult and, you know what I mean? I mean, they do original and adapted, but then that sort of like breaks things down so that a critically acclaimed comedy can get. Woody Allen, most of his movies have been nominated for best screenplay. Not most, but 70%. But I bet you if you added a comedy cat, 70%.\n\nCheck it out. Curse of Jade Scorpion. Look it up. I don't think it was one of them. That was not one of them. No, no, no. I was thinking about the one with the guy from Deadwood. What was that?\n\nIt was so lucky. The one was about the magician. Oh, Scoop. Scoop. Yeah. Terrible. Scoop was rough. Scoop was very terrible.\n\nWoody had about seven years that were just like some solid whips. Yeah, but if you look at everything he's done. Well, that one was hot on the heels of two good ones in a row. Oh, right. Because that was right after Match Point. Which I always say goes to Conjuring. Or one good one. Yeah.\n\nOne good one. But then he did a second one in England that was Scoop. Yeah. And that didn't go over so well. You know, the rate he makes them at is like Go for it. I say it. Did you guys watch the American Masters CBS two-part? I didn't see all of it.\n\nHoly shit. That's like the best thing I've seen in months. I gotta say, I forgot. In my mind, I'm so compartmentalized. I thought Sunyi was like 18 when she moved in there. She was there like she was his child. She was like 12 or 11 Except that he didn't live there. But still, she knew him as her father. she was his child she was like 12 or 11 except that he didn't live there but still\n\nshe knew him as her father she was a child oh what is this a man and a woman having a discussion about Woody Allen and his child bride\n\nthat he adopted the best argument for Woody Allen and Sunyi if you have to watch Wild Man Blues it's a documentary\n\nabout him touring with his blues or jazz band and it's like just watching them interact it's so funny he's like you know them interact is so funny. He's like, you know, she doesn't know anything.\n\nShe's eating out of garbage, you know? This is like he's just talking about her like that, but it does make her sound like, you know. Well, in the documentary, don't they talk about how Mia Farrow was on the set of Husbands and Wives when she got the phone call saying, well, I thought she had to continue shooting. She did. So she gets the phone call that they found out.\n\nIt's breaking news. No, she found it. She found the pictures of nude Sunyi in Woody's house. I thought someone called her and told her they were there. No, she had to go to Woody's house. She took the pictures. And found naked Polaroids. Developed them and then found them.\n\nFound naked Polaroids of her daughter on his mantle. But they were really tasteful. So they were super tasteful. Yeah, they were artsy, like he was setting up some shots for a film. Exactly, for a film. Wow. And right next to his story. And then had to go and shoot a super emotional scene with him.\n\nThat's one of those cheap, crazy stories. Well, I just wonder what scene that was. Did they talk about what scene it was? It's in the PBS documentary. They then show that scene. Oh, okay. I didn't get that far. Yeah.\n\nIt's phenomenal. That documentary, if you guys haven't seen it, I don't know if it's still on, but it was the American Masters on Woody Allen is phenomenal. It's got to be. His life must have been so amazing because he was just a, he was just, he was so funny and smart that he instantly became a sex symbol and then just played the complete nerd to the hilt for so long. Oh, yeah. While still also, every co-star was gorgeous. And now that he's an old man, it gets gorgeous women to just be in his movies.\n\nOh, they love him. He's just filming. He's spending his days filming Scarlett Johansson. And tell her how smart she is. There's great stuff in there. He's built the most amazing life for himself. I hadn't realized his first wife is the woman in Bananas.\n\nLouise Lasser. Louise Lasser. Yes, thank you. And he leaves her for Diane Keaton. Diane Keaton to Mia Farrow. It's like mental. And Diane Keaton's still like totally in love with him. Oh yeah.\n\nI've heard her on interviews talk about him and she just like. She's aged very nicely and gracefully as well. Oh yeah. And she'd be a perfect wife for him right now. That would be amazing. The people would go nuts about that. She would make complete sense right now. Yeah.\n\nAnd they'd both be in good movies and shitty movies. Yeah. You know, they'd just work at their pace and. I think'd both be in good movies and shitty movies. You know, they just work at their pace and I think that would be happy together. Did you? I mean, the thing that I loved about Woody Allen when he did, I guess is now almost a decade ago. But when he did stand up at the Academy Awards, he just came out and did. Oh, yeah. I think they talked him into it because of 9-11.\n\nYeah. And it was still like, wow. Oh, right. Because it was about New York. And I'm going to go on there and try this. I've never felt more raped by a... It's the first time you ever showed up to any awards ceremony, right? That was his whole thing.\n\nOh, wow. Yeah, and it was great to see him, but a couple of his jokes were super cornball. But I mean, still, for a guy who's not before you... I was happy to see him up there, you guys. I love it. He brought the nation back together not I was happy to see him up there you guys I love it he brought the nation back together I was happy to see him\n\nI really was I'm happy you showed up award shut up brought our nation together there's hardly a comedic mind or filmmaker\n\nthat I appreciate more than him so it's crazy that McG that he also what about McG well there's three total there's Woody Allen\n\nthere's McG favorite McG and there's Gary Marshall who There's Woody Allen. There's McG. Yeah. Favorite McG movies. And there's Gary Marshall, who used to be terrible, but now he's really- Now he's hit his stride. Now he's got his groove on, and he's really making amazing movies. He made two or three great movies back in the day, and a lot of okay ones. Sure. But now it's just like-\n\nGary Marshall created Happy Days. Valentine's Day before that. Oh, that. Yeah. It's like, this Marshall created Happy Days. Valentine's Day before that. Oh, Valentine's Day. Yeah. It's like, this one's even worse than Valentine's Day by all accounts. I mean, it seems like he just has figured out a thing. It's like, it's the foolproof method. It's like, I'll get every actor for one day and we'll shoot it and it'll be the biggest\n\nmovie of all time. I think it tells you, because Gary Marshall's obviously a very lovable sort of fellow to work with. And they probably all, each actor probably gets a million and shoots for a week yeah and they get to get paired up with somebody sexy that they get to kind of flirt with all week or whatever you know like ashton kutcher and leah michelle are in an elevator together and that's got to be like good business for both of them like why wouldn't both of those people want to be in a scene together and make out in an elevator i mean to me it's like it bombs, nobody's going down with it.\n\nBut this is like the continuation. It's not hanging on anybody. It's like the horrible continuation of Cannonball Run. It's like what you loved about Cannonball Run, which was like, oh, cool, you get to see all these people that you really like, and they're being funny. I liked the cars. You loved all those fans. Loved those cars. But I mean, this is like that, but not funny.\n\nIt's like, oh, I get to see all these people I kind of like be sappy. Well, Cannonball Run's not going to hold up to the scrutiny of today. I agree, but it is. At least it tried. As soon as you say let's have 16 stars in this thing, you're already saying, and let's also take the quality\n\ndown a notch. We can't make it an amazing thing with that many superstars that all get to step in and say, hey, I'm Bon Jovi. I'm not going to do it that way. But I sort of understood Valentine's Day as a concept. It's like, are people really running around needing to get something out of their New Year's Eve?\n\nWell, especially two weeks before New Year's Eve. New Year's Eve happens on a Sunday this year. I'm trying to get through Christmas today. Release the movie that weekend. They're afraid that after that weekend no one's going to want to see it. It's still a new year for the rest of the month. You know what I mean?\n\nPeople saw whatever it used to be. Now movies get out of the theater so fast. But it used to be like the big Christmas movies. That's all we had all of January. So something like that came along in January to spice it up. You'd be watching Elf all the way through. Release it on January 7th. Everyone can sit there and go, yeah, we just did that. So something like that came along in January to spice it up. You'd be watching Elf all the way through. Like, release it on January 7th. You know, everyone can sit there and go, yeah, we just did that.\n\nWe just celebrated that. No, man. Like, people don't stop going to Christmas movies on the 26th. People want their Jon Bon Jovi, all right? They want him. They want him early. It just looks so formulaic and so, but like- I read all the descriptions of like what everybody does.\n\nLike one person is like helping, like the ball is falling, but there's a mechanical problem. Hilary Swank is in charge of the ball drop. No. And there's suspense about whether or not the ball drop is going to happen. And then they're trapped in the elevator. But what does De Niro do? Somebody said De Niro shot his scenes in an hour. Yeah.\n\nHe's dying. He's in a hospital room. And Halle Berry is his nurse. Oh, my God. But you've seen it, Doug. I have not seen this film. I could talk about movies as if I've seen them.\n\nI feel like you just watched the HBO making of documentary. I didn't see Twilight, you guys. Watch me work. No, I did see it. I can't wait to talk about it. You guys are such good guests, like we've practically run out of time already. This has never happened to me before.\n\nWe're just talking actually about movies for the most part. You are talking about movies. Except for that one story we're going to have to cut. Oh, yeah. Just kidding. Panties on the Cruise Line? No, I loved it all. Oh, that was a good one, too. No, it's all been great, but do you guys want to try to get in a really\n\nquick Leonard Maltz game? Yeah, let's do it. It has to go really fast you now jason and june you've never been on before and i don't blame you if you haven't listened to the show but do you have an idea of how this game works we have to decide it's been described to me okay see now that's the thing the listeners see it's been described to him yes but it's still not it's not always easy to catch on. It's so I mean, basically, it's name that tune with movies and you have to select how many actors you can if you get names of the actors, what movie they're in. I mean, that it's self-explanatory. We'll figure it out. We'll start with you, Paul. All right. Great. That way, I don't really help them to understand what's happening as it's happening. You get to pick a category.\n\nOh, really quickly, let's see who you guys want to play for. I got some Twitter names from the audience. Paul, would you like to play for a gentleman or a lady named AtShaneAdams, or would you prefer to play for Kgoog, K-G-O-O-G? I like Shane Adams. All right, Shane Adams is who Paul is going to play for. G-O-O-G. I like Shane Adams. Alright, Shane Adams is who Paul is going to play for. And then\n\nJune, would you like to play for B. Lange B-L-A-N-G or Johnny Unusual? Johnny Unusual. I thought you might pick that. Sorry, B. Lange. That was an unfair matchup. That was an unfair matchup. Jason, would you like to play for Snap the Jap or I Hate Your\n\nFavorite Movie? Snap the Jap, by the way, has donated to our show. Okay, then I will play for Snap the Jap. Oh, nice! I like Snap the Jap, by the way, has donated to our show. Okay, then I will play for Snap the Jap. Oh, nice. I like that name, though. Sean Sackamay. Yeah, it's abbreviated. It's I Hate Your Fave Move,\n\nbut I still like that somebody said I Hate Your Favorite Movie as their Twitter name. I like that, too. Because it's really... It's needlessly confrontational. I Hate Your Favorite Movie. That'd be a fun game. Just name the greatest movie you could think of, that too because it's really it's needlessly confrontational i hate your favorite movie that'd be a fun game like you just name the greatest movie you could think of and then and then you just have to think of a reason why it's terrible that actually would be great\n\nthat's a good uh too many dumb hats that would be that movie has too many scenes okay Okay. It does, right? It probably has more scenes than almost any other 90-minute movie. It's definitely a big movie. Too much Tony Robbins. I don't like scenes with tennis. Max. Max.\n\nOkay, so now we have who you're playing for. Paul's playing for Shane Adams. June's playing for Johnny Unusual. And Jason's playing for our good friend Snap the Jab, who one time was a guest on my show because he bid on it. The CDR Christmas.\n\nYeah. So he's very involved. But I don't know about that name, Snap the Jab. I don't really approve of that. Yeah. All right.\n\nPaul, you get to pick a category. Is it bad that I assumed it was a woman and Jap was Jewish American Princess? Oh. That's probably what Sean means. FYI American princess. That's probably what Sean means. FYI, guys.\n\nThat's probably what he was going for. At Fourth Ninja suggested this one, Paul. It's a ponderful life. That's movies that have a pun in the title. Okay. So that's fun around the holidays. IFC's most underrated comedies.\n\nThey did a list on IFC of the 10 most underrated comedies, according to them, of all times. So one of them might be the holidays. IFC's most underrated comedies. They did a list on IFC of the 10 most underrated comedies, according to them, of all time. So one of them might be the answer. And then at unavailable name suggested Beta Carradine, which is movies starring any of the Carradine acting dynasty.\n\nDavid, John, Robert, Martha Plimpton. No, I'm going to take Pun for the Holidays. It's a Pundiful Life. Pundiful Life, okay. It's a Pundiful Life. All right. This category, I mean this movie in this category. We'll see.\n\nThis movie is from 2004. Three stars from Leonard Maltin. It's an engaging comedy And he says That it was co-written By the director and the leading actor Okay 2004, three stars There's a pun in the title\n\nEngaging comedy is directed Written by the director along with the leading actor and there are eight names listed i think and nine nine names nine names total how many names you can get i'm gonna just start it around i'm gonna say i can name that in six names six names so then we come to jason and you can either bid less names. This is reading from the bottom, the more obscure names up to the top. So we've already eliminated the top three actors or actresses. So you start from the least known. can say to Paul, name that movie. Okay, I will bid five. You don't get penalized for losing either way, but you only get a point if you successfully name a movie or fail to name a movie when challenged.\n\nOkay, I will bid five names. Alright, so we come to June. So how many names are left? Five names. There's out of nine, he's, wait, you bid five? No, no, no, I bid six. He said five. Okay, you bid five. So now you can go down to four, three, two, one, or zero if you think you know the name of the movie.\n\nBut if you can do it in one actor, you're talking about the ninth actor listed, right? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Got it. Got it. I just – like you're just basically going Robert Loja. Yes.\n\nIs what's happening. It could be that. It's in 90% of American movies. It could be that person. Yeah. I don't know how many movies Robert Lodge's ninth billed in. It's probably going to be somebody even more obscure than that. Yeah, that's true.\n\nBut you never know because sometimes there's celebrity cameos that get lower billing. So wait, I'm sorry. So Paul's saying he's going to... No, no, I'm done. Don't worry about Paul. It's just between you and Jason now. You can either say name it if you don't think he can name it after hearing me tell him the four names. Five names.\n\nHe gets five names. Or what's my other option? Or your other option is to bid lower and say you can name it with only having heard four names. Or three or two. But if you don't think you have a clue based on anything you've heard so far and knowing that the names are going to be fairly obscure.\n\nAn engaging comedy. Written by the lead actor and director. If I were like a cheating kind of host. 2004. I think I kind of know what it is. Then you should bid low enough so that Paul will be forced to ask you to name it. Yeah, so if you say four movies, then you can guess it, and you'll hear four names. Four names, yeah.\n\nOkay, so I'll say four. Okay, she says four. I'll say name that movie. She says name it. All right. 2004, right? Engage in comedy. Yeah, here we go.\n\nThree stars from Leonard, and it was written by the director along with the leading actor, whose name you will not hear because that person's the leading actor. name you will not hear because that person is the leading actor. And the four names you get to hear are\n\nRafe Spall, Jessica Stevenson, Penelope Wilton, and Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy. See, I think I know what it is. I don't know.\n\nI thought it was something else. I mean, I want to. What happens now? Can I say you've seen that movie? Do you get to talk it out at all? It's a British movie. Is it Love Actually? I thought it was something else. I mean, I want... What happens now? Can I say... No, you... Do you mean that movie?\n\nDo you get to talk it out at all? No. It's a British movie. Is it Love Actually? I mean, but it's... Is it Love Actually? Is it Love Actually? No.\n\nIs that a pun, really? No, it's not. That's why I was like... That's why I was like, it doesn't feel like it's a pun. No, it's... I'll tell you the rest of the names and see if you guys can dive in.\n\nDylan... Can I ask one more question? Sure. Wait, can we go to five names and see if I can get it? Paul gets the point. Okay. If we go to five names, see if I get it, and then six names and see if Paul can get in. Can I ask one more question? Sure. Wait, can we go to five names and see if I can get it? Paul gets the point. If we go to five names, see if I get it, and then six names and see if Paul can get it. Can I ask one question or no?\n\nWhat? You can, sure. It's over. It's done. Yeah, but you can ask for fun. No, no, no. Is it a fun question? Go on. What's your question? Is it a wedding-related movie? No. No.\n\nBut that's a good guess. Dylan Moran, Nick Frost, Lucy Davis, What's your question? Is it a wedding-related movie? No. All right. But that's a good guess. Dylan Moran, Nick Frost, Lucy Davis, Kate Ashfield, and the lead actor referred to is Simon Pegg. Oh. Wow. I know it's one. It's that stupid running one, right? Run Fat Boy Run? No.\n\nNo. Shaun of the Dead. What? Oh, that's Shaun of the Dead. 2004, Shaun of the Dead. That's crazy. Wow. Pun in the title. Wow. Yeah, see? How amazing is it that it's Shaun of the Dead. What? Oh, that's Shaun of the Dead. 2004, Shaun of the Dead. That's crazy. Wow.\n\nPun in the title. Wow. Yeah, see? How amazing is it that it's Shaun of the Dead? It's an ugly game. I know. It's an ugly, ugly game. June refuses to watch Shaun of the Dead. I've tried to show it to her.\n\nOh, it's so much fun. Do you not like any zombie things? No, it's just become a thing. Every time we go to watch a movie, Paul, the first suggestion is Shaun of the Dead, and I just shoot it down now for the point of it. It's really fun. I know it's good. And she's watched five minutes of Die Hard so far,\n\nand you really like that. Oh, my God. I just watched Die Hard in the theater, and it's so... Oh, really? It was great. That movie's so great. It's so good.\n\nI was loving it. I loved every second of it. That and Lethal Weapon 1, really good Christmas movies. Oh, great. I was talking about Christmas movies on Graham Elwood's podcast, and Die Hard never came up,\n\nand then people wrote to me on Twitter, why didn't you mention Die Hard? I was like, now that you mentioned it, I agree. That is the best Christmas movie. Did The Family Stone come up? No, it didn't.\n\nLove that movie. I actually like that movie. It's a great, good Christmas movie. It seems sad. What is The Family Stone? Like, what is the actual stone? I can't believe\n\nyou've never seen The Family Stone. The Stone is the name of The Family. Their last name is Stone. And it's very, it's really white people's problems kind of movie. But is that the movie\n\nwhere she's working too hard? Where the character is based on Mrs. Robinson? Is that that movie? No, that was Rumor Has It. That's the most awful thing ever.\n\nThat's the craziest one. Family Stone's all right. Family Stone's Jessica, Sarah Jessica Parker and Luke Wilson. And Rachel McAdams. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd the girl from Twilight. And Diane, aforementioned Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson. The one movie I wanted to do for our podcast for Christmas, but we didn't do it, was Surviving Christmas with James Gandolfini and Ben Affleck before it was changed. I got to say Mixed Nuts is one of my favorite Christmas movies. Oh, that's a crazy one. I love that movie. That's one of my favorite Christmas movies. Oh, that's a crazy one. I love that movie. That's one of those big cast movies. Yeah, it's a big one.\n\nI love that movie. Adam Sandler. Jon Stewart. Oh, wow. Rita Wilson. In a scene at the beginning with Parker Posey. Yeah, crazy. Okay, so since Paul got a point.\n\nSo now we start with you, Jason. Then we go in the direction of Paul this time. We have switched directions. Do I get to choose the category again? I give you new categories. Great. Yeah, you get to pick between the following. Would you like In Theaters Now?\n\nThat's movies that are playing in theaters now. A good friend, King of Pancakes, suggested the number one movie blank years ago. And in this case, it's six years ago. So it would be the number one movie in the country six years ago to this very day. Or this is to help promote my appearance on the Weezer Cruise. Weezer on the soundtrack. That's a motion picture that has a Weezer song on the soundtrack. I'm going to go for In Theaters Now.\n\nI don't think it's ever been chosen, that category. In Theaters Now. Okay. That's a tough one. Yeah. go for In Theaters Now. I don't think it's ever been chosen, that category. In Theaters Now, okay. That's a tough one. Yeah, this is In A Theater Now. Okay. Leonard doesn't give stars\n\nto the current movies. He just writes an extra long review on his app, so I'll just read you a couple of things from the review, hopefully, that don't... You guys will probably\n\nfigure this out as we go, but the clues are meant to not help. They're meant to be... I obviously did not figure that out. ...somewhat substantial, but also they end up being misleading. Okay.\n\nIt plays games with your head when you think too hard about the clues. Man, it's a hard one to pick stuff out. It's all very... Okay. What about his genre? No Okay, I'm not crazy about the advertising for this movie Leonard Maltin says in his review Okay, great\n\nYeah, and he also says about this movie That it gives you plenty of food for thought So he's not crazy about the advertising And there's plenty of food for thought. So he's not crazy about the advertising, and there's plenty of food for thought. And there are 10 names listed. How many names do you think you can get it in? Jason Mantzoukas. In theaters now.\n\nYes. In theaters now. He's playing in hopefully 1,000 or more theaters. He's not crazy about the advertising. There's 10 names listed? Mm-hmm. 5. 1,000 or more theaters. He says 5. 5 the advertising. There's ten names listed? Five. A thousand or more theaters.\n\nHe says five. Five names. So now we go to Paul. Four. Four. June, what do you think? I say name that movie. All right.\n\nNow if Paul successfully names the movie. I can't go to three, right? No, it's too late. That ship has sailed. Got it. Okay. It's very strategic. Yes.\n\nSo if Paul gets this correct, he will win the entire game. I want to keep playing this game. I'm enjoying it. This is a good game. This is a great game. We'll have you on again for sure. And we'll start the game sooner. Yes.\n\nWe just talked for too long. Here we go. How many names do you get? Four. Four. Okay. Four names. All right.\n\nDo you want the clues again? No. Give me the names. You got it. Calm down. Okay. Four names. All right. Do you want the clues again? No. Give me the names. You got it. Calm down. Give me the names. I'm pretty confident in Paul on this one. You are?\n\nYeah, yeah. When you said 1,000 theaters or more, I thought maybe it was. Okay. Go on. It could be less than 1,000, but I'm not sure exactly the theater count, but it's a big release. Michael Stolberg, Helen McCrory, Christopher Lee, and Jude Law. Oh. Oh.\n\nDamn it. Wait a second. Oh, he's puzzled. Right, I'm puzzled. You might pull this one out, June. Wait a second. He might not figure it out. I definitely should know it.\n\nJude Law? What is he in right now? I definitely should know it. Jude Law? What is he in right now? Oh, it's killing me because I'm going to be so mad at myself for not getting this. Oh, this always trips me up. He's not crazy about the advertising.\n\nJude Law. Damn it. I know it and I'm going to – I don't know it off the top of my head. Is Jude Law in more than one movie right now? He's got Sherlock Holmes coming out, A Game of Shadows or whatever it's called. But he's – I think he's only in one other movie, this one. And what's freaky to me about him being in this movie is this movie reminds me of, and he was in AI. Oh.\n\nSo it's an interesting connection. And then the rest of the names are Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone, Sasha Baron Cohen, Ben Kingsley. Oh, I got it now. Chloe Moretz. So maybe she's just going by Chloe Moretz now. Hugo. I did not realize he was in that Hugo movie. Hugo. Yeah.\n\nDoesn't Hugo seem like AI a little bit? Yeah, it does. It does. I can't believe I lost it. So Paul's not getting a point. No, I don't get a point. You get a point. No, you get the point, yeah. Doesn't Hugo seem like AI a little bit? Yeah, it does. It does. I can't believe I lost it. So Paul's not getting a point. No, I don't get a point. You get a point. No, you get the point, June.\n\nYay. Yes. I wouldn't have gotten it. I'm happy that I didn't get that. Jason needs to catch up. Oh, Jesus. All right. Here we go.\n\nAll right. So your dream came true. We do get to play some more. Woo-hoo. And so let's see. I didn't see Hugo. I hear it's the best movie of the year. Did you see it?\n\nI've heard great things about it. I got tons of nominations from – but the thing I want – But I agree. The advertising was horrible. Horrible. It made it look terrible. I think it's a hard – it's one of those hard sell kind of movies because like the basic idea of the movie is it's just about the joy of movies. Yeah.\n\nAnd that's sort of hard to sell to people in a TV spot. And then the 3D is supposed to be gorgeous. Everyone says they're the best 3D. Yeah. We'll see. I'm going to see it soon, I guess. All right. You get to pick a category again, Jason, and then we'll go to June from you.\n\nOkay. What do we got? Would you like Obama? That's movies that have a black president in the movie. that have a black president in the movie. Or Juggling Geese suggested Pussy Galore, which is a film with lots of cats in it. Okay.\n\nOr at least about a cat. And then Four Letters. That's a movie where the entire title is four letters, an example, of course, being MASH. Four Letters. Okay. This four-letter word that's a movie is from 2010. Leonard Maltin says that it's only worth two stars.\n\nHe says that the main character is tough and that the action scenes make this mindless fun. I only gave it two stars, but it's still mindless fun. Okay. And the main character is tough. And there are eight names listed four letter title there's eight eight names listed okay I can do it so how many\n\nin three four letter word okay we go to June oh four letter word okay so it's not an acronym no okay\n\nnot an acronym like MASH a four letter word like got like MASH but okay but I understand why yeah yeah yeah you know like snatch if it had if it had two less letters Got like mash, but I understand why. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, like Snatch, if it had two less letters.\n\nTwo. Two, she says. Name that movie. All right. 2010. You get two names. It's from 2010, four letters in the title. Your two names are Hunt Block and Daniel Pierce.\n\nSo that's no help. So what four-letter title do you think happened in 2010 with a tough lead character that had action scenes that make for mindless fun? Oh, I think I do know this. I feel like I can guess. 2010. Is that Hannah?\n\nNo, that's the name. You're thinking of Hannah. Hannah. When was No, that's the main letter. You're thinking of Hannah. Hannah. When was Hannah? Hannah must have been this year. It was this year, actually. It was this year, and it was not four letters.\n\nBut other than that, it's a great guess. That character of Hannah is tough. Tough to say her first name. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. All right, so.\n\nI got nothing. We got to call it. Four letters in 2009. Can I guess? Yeah. Paul. No, that was also this. Oh, was it this year?\n\nThat was last year. That was last year. It was? Yeah. It was this year. Wait, Paul was last year. Paul was last year because. Paul was this year.\n\nI saw it at Southwest and Comic-Con of this year. I thought it was Bridesmaids this year at South by. Yeah. Also, they showed them both. And Attack the Block. Attack the Block is great. Yeah, I love that. Okay, so the rest of the names are August Deal, Andre Brower, Daniel Chitawell, Ojafor.\n\nHow do you pronounce that guy? Chiwetel. Chiwetel. Yeah. Lev Schreiber Leav Schreiber And Angelina Jolie As Salt Salt\n\nYou bastards Well I won So Paul is our winner Wait how did Paul win? Because he told June to name the tune And then here's the fun thing that happens When we play for people on Twitter Paul is our winner. Wait, how did Paul win? Oh, because he told June to name the two. Yeah. And then here's the fun thing that happens when we play for people on Twitter or when we play for people in the audience.\n\nBecause I'd love to have you guys on a show in front of an audience. Paul's done that before. So much fun. The two losing people. The winner gets like a prize package of some sort. So I'll try to get in touch with Shane Adams and give him some sort of prize. But the other two people get to name, and they've already told me who they want me to name. They get to name\n\nsomebody for me to call a shithead as the closing line of the show. Before we go... You know what, Doug? I have something in my bag. I'm going to give this winner, which is a limited edition NTSF badge. Oh my god! That's fantastic. I'm going to give this winner, which is a limited edition NTSF badge. Oh, my God. So they can have that.\n\nThat's fantastic. There you go. I don't think – He probably doesn't live anywhere around here, so I'm just going to go home and put this on a stack of stuff in my home that people have handed to me in a similar fashion. There you go. And hopefully get it to him someday. Someday it will get to him.\n\nAnd more episodes coming soon? Yes, in the summer. Nice. What's the way to say it quickly? NTSS. NTSF. NTSFSDSUV.

Oh, thank you.\n\nI got to hear it. Such a funny scene. Yeah, it was a great scene. Great scene. You're hilarious in it. Adam Scott, very hilarious. Are you just getting like, you know, you've always worked as an actor, but do you think the crazy beard's really like taking it to another level?\n\nThe crazy beard is getting me tons of work. It's a great look. It's a very good look. Yeah, yeah. Jason's in that new Sacha Baron Cohen movie. He's in Dictator. Yeah. Which is more like it's scripted.\n\nYeah, it's a straight movie. It feels sort of like Bruno still because he's such a crazy character. He's a crazy character, but there is nothing in the real world. It is just a straight narrative fiction. Yeah, yeah. I saw the trailer and had a couple super good laughs. I remember the blow, the last moment of the trailer being really funny, which is like so hard to come by these days. Like an actual solid laugh at the end of a trailer.\n\nTotally. At the end of the trailer, Frisella Combs is like, I'm on vacation! No, my honeymoon. I'm on my honeymoon. Oh, okay. That's an awesome punchline. I wonder if that character's on his honeymoon when this happens. Just exposition.\n\nYeah, yeah. And then both of you guys, June and Paul, you're both involved in When's Ass Backwards coming out. Oh. What's the story with that? You know, because I went on IMDb.

It'll be right in the beginning of the new year. Okay, good. So this will be a nice tease, because this will be out tomorrow. Okay, great. Yeah, this will be out tomorrow, so people look forward to the conversations that's going to happen in mere minutes.\n\nIn about two and a half weeks. Yeah, you'll get to hear it in two and a half weeks. And see Twilight, the latest Twilight. While you can. Or catch up on all of them. Yeah, go to town. See the whole, all four. Because it only makes sense if you've seen them all.\n\nWell, that's where it'll be an interesting conversation for me because I want to know some things. Yeah, I have some questions too. Because this is my first one I've paid attention to. This is my second one I've seen. Same. I've seen them all, but this is the first one I've paid attention to. Some have been on TV in the background in hotel rooms. Okay, so thanks also to\n\nCyrus and to Earwolf and as always Which one do I say first? The SAG, uh, the SAG nominations are a shithead and I love this one. Navin Johnson's dog in the jerk. Uh,\n\nis it shithead? He is shithead. Shithead. That's great. It's a good one. It's the most creative one I've ever heard. Now it's time for Doug to watch another talkie. Eyes of gold, his viewing prowess makes him cocky."
