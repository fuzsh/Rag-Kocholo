        "text": "Love is a powerful force that can bring two individuals together in the most unexpected ways. Such is the case with the dynamic duo of June Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer, whose love story has captivated hearts for over a decade.\n\nThe couple’s undeniable affection was on display as they graced the premiere of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in Los Angeles, California, alongside their two adorable boys.\n\nFor fans of the hit Netflix series Grace and Frankie, it was a bittersweet moment when the show ended. June Diane Raphael shone brightly in her role as the sharp-tongued Brianna Hanson, the eldest daughter of Grace Hanson, played by the iconic Jane Fonda.\n\nPaul Scheer and June Diane Raphael with their sons Gus and Sam at the premiere of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in Los Angeles, California on May 30, 2023 (Credit: Abaca Press / INSTARimages)\n\nWhile her portrayal in Grace and Frankie solidified her reputation, Raphael’s talent extends far beyond that. With credits on beloved shows like Big Mouth and New Girl, she has become a familiar face on television.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul Scheer has carved out his path to success. His role in the Emmy-nominated series Black Monday showcased his versatility and undeniable talent.\n\nWith a shared passion for the entertainment industry, it’s no wonder that Raphael and Scheer found solace in each other’s arms. Their ability to balance successful careers with a loving partnership is a testament to their strong bond.\n\nLet’s dive deeper into the enchanting journey of this comedic power couple and discover the magic that keeps their love aflame.\n\nPaul Scheer: The Man Who Caught June Diane Raphael’s Heart\n\nPaul Scheer is a multi-talented individual who has made his mark in various fields. Originally hailing from Huntington, New York, Scheer’s journey began at Saint Anthony’s High School.\n\nEager to expand his horizons, he pursued a communication and education degree at New York University, where he honed his skills and fostered his passion for creativity.\n\nIn 2005, Scheer embarked on a new chapter in his career, seeking fresh ventures under the spotlight. During this time, he joined forces with fellow comedians Rob Huebel, Aziz Ansari, and director Jason Woliner to craft a series of captivating short films.\n\nPromotional shot featuring Paul Scheer as Dr. Andre Nowzick in the sitcom The League (Credit: FX)\n\nTheir collaborative efforts gained attention and acclaim, paving the way for their rise to prominence. The turning point came when MTV recognized the group’s comedic genius and granted them the opportunity to develop a sketch series titled Human Giant, which premiered in 2007.\n\nDespite the sketch’s success, Scheer’s creative journey continued as he explored and thrived in various projects. His portrayal of Andre Nowzick in the FX series The League remains one of his most recognized and beloved roles. He also appeared in notable shows such as the HBO program Veep and the ABC comedy Fresh Off the Boat.\n\nHow June Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer Crossed Paths\n\nIn 2004, the paths of June Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer crossed during the New York comedy show Rode Hard and Put Away Wet production.\n\nThe artistic director of Manhattan’s Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre brought Scheer in to offer advice and suggestions to Raphael and her comedy partner, Casey Wilson, to improve their show.\n\nDuring their initial encounter, Raphael paid little attention to Scheer. In an interview with LA Weekly in February 2013, Scheer recalled the story from their rented Los Feliz apartment, which Raphael humorously called “the house that basic cable built.”\n\nJune Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer married in October 2009 at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History and have two sons, born in 2014 and 2016 (Credit: Sara De Boer / Startraksphoto)\n\nHowever, Raphael claimed to have no recollection of ignoring him and, in fact, later took Scheer out to lunch to express her gratitude for his assistance, although he ordered only water. At the time, both Raphael and Scheer were involved with other people, so their romantic connection took time to develop.\n\nThey had a dinner date that was initially unclear if it was an actual date, as they wondered, “‘Is this a date?’ dates,” as Scheer recalled. Unfortunately, their plans were interrupted when two friends unexpectedly joined them, turning the evening into a group outing where they all danced to ’80s music.\n\nScheer shared, “It was January and surprisingly warm. So we walked home together, and when I got to June’s apartment, she went in for the kiss.”\n\nPaul Scheer and June Diane Raphael met in January 2004, when the artistic director of Manhattan’s Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre brought Scheer in to offer advice to Raphael and her comedy partner Casey Wilson on making improvements to their UCB two-woman sketch show (Credit: Faye Sadou / Media Punch / INSTARimages)\n\nThat moment confused Scheer, who believed they were still in the “friend zone.” Nevertheless, he quickly realized his true feelings and reciprocated.\n\nShortly after, the couple decided to leave New York and make their home in Los Angeles, prompted by Hollywood’s Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre opening in 2005.\n\nScheer reflected on this decision, stating, “That was enough of a safety blanket for me. June was already going, and I didn’t want to lose her.”\n\nJune Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer’s Successful Marriage\n\nIn 2009, after five years of being together, June Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer tied the knot at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.\n\nTheir relationship extends beyond romance, as they are also creative collaborators. They co-host a comedy podcast called “How Did This Get Made?” where they humorously dissect and analyze questionable films.\n\nHowever, working together in any capacity can be challenging, as Raphael revealed in an interview on The Drew Barrymore Show, where she described the moments of self-doubt that arise during their creative process.\n\nShe said, “And then we’ll finish the scene and I’ll say, ‘Did you like it?’ and he’ll say, ‘Yeah.’ And then I’ll say, ‘Why do you hate me so much? Why do you think I’m the worst? I don’t believe you.’ It spirals so quickly.”\n\nThrough the ups and downs, Raphael and Scheer discovered the key to maintaining a happy relationship: a sense of humor. In a lighthearted video on Scheer’s YouTube channel in 2022, they playfully shared their one rule for a successful marriage.\n\nAccording to Scheer, “To have a successful marriage for 13 years, we have one rule only which is whatever happens at international waters stays in international waters. But if you are on land, we are married.”\n\nPaul Scheer and June Diane Raphael making an appearance together at Charlize Theron’s Africa Outreach Project 2023 Block Party held at the Universal Studios Backlot in Universal City, California on May 20, 2023 (Credit: Faye’s Vision / Cover Images)\n\nDespite their fame and success, June Diane Raphael remains grateful for the stability and happy marriage has brought her.\n\nAt the 2019 premiere of her film Long Shot, she expressed her contentment with married life, telling Page Six, “I’m happy to be married I have no desire to be single – I really don’t. Those were dark days. I remember being in my 20s in this city – I walk around right now and I am like, ‘I can never go into that bar. It is just a minefield of terrible decisions.'”\n\nIs June Diane Raphael Older Than Paul Scheer?\n\nJune Diane Raphael, born on January 4, 1980, is an American actress, comedian, and screenwriter. She is currently 43 years old and stands at a height of 5 feet 8 ½ inches (174 cm).\n\nMeanwhile, Paul Scheer, born on January 31, 1976, is an American comedian, actor, filmmaker, and podcaster. He is currently 47 years old and stands at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).\n\nPaul Scheer and June Diane Raphael looking every bit the stunning couple at the Oceana and The Walden Woods Project Present: Rock Under the Stars with Don Henley and Friends event in Los Angeles, California on July 17, 2017 (Credit: Milla Cochran / Startraksphoto)\n\nWhile June Diane Raphael is four years younger than her husband, Paul Scheer is 2 ½ inches taller than her.\n\nRaphael and Scheer’s Children and Their Parenting Style\n\nIn addition to their thriving marriage, June Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer are the proud parents of two wonderful sons named Gus and Sam.\n\nThe journey of parenthood for the couple began with the birth of their first son, August, lovingly nicknamed Gus, on April 30, 2014. Before starting a family, they gave themselves the gift of time. Their love and commitment grew stronger before embarking on this beautiful adventure of raising children.\n\nIn January 2014, Raphael shared the exciting news of her pregnancy via Instagram, playfully claiming she woke up in Vegas with a baby bump.\n\nMore than two years later, in August 2016, their family expanded with the arrival of their second son, Sam, completing their family of four.\n\nThe humorous couple couldn’t resist cracking a few jokes when Sam arrived. In a lighthearted statement to People, they playfully teased that their baby was “available for all endorsements and sponsorships,” injecting laughter into the joyous occasion of welcoming a new family member.\n\nBut beyond the humor, Raphael expressed her admiration for Scheer’s parenting skills. In an Instagram post, she thanked him for his unwavering support and dedication as a father.\n\nShe acknowledged his commitment to their family, writing, “Happy Father’s Day to one of the best in the biz @paulscheer Thank you for understanding that I can sleep through anything and for always getting up ( multiple times ) during the night to tend to screaming children.”\n\nPaul Scheer and June Diane Raphael attending the Artios Awards in Los Angeles, California, on January 31, 2019 (Credit: Milla Cochran / Startraksphoto)\n\nDespite their sons’ young age, Raphael and Scheer believe in instilling essential values and fostering meaningful conversations about important topics. One such topic is “gender fluidity,” which frequently arises in their home.\n\nIn an interview with Us Weekly in January 2020, Raphael shared, “At my house, we talk a lot about how gender is fluid. I always say I have two boys until they tell me otherwise. I’m not committed to their gender.”\n\nGus and Sam are being raised to understand the importance of “feelings and vulnerability” and “what it means to be kind and take care of people.”\n\nJune Diane Raphael and Paul Scheer at HBO’s Official 2015 Emmy After Party in Los Angeles, California on September 20, 2015 (Credit: Tony DiMaio / Startraksphoto)"
