        "text": "I had the privilege of attending the Sundance Film Festival in 2024, at Park City, UT as a Journalist of Color. A \"twist\" of fate (pun intended), I hurt my knee and was on crutches all 9 days I was there! Both circumstances added unexpected layers of insight. Here were talented storytellers elevating culturally anchored narratives to a completely different plane- with subtexts and super-texts. In the same breath, privilege and access played a big part in the experience. Despite their best intentions (and truly, the festival folks tried) there were many logistical challenges for people with accessibility needs. When I eventually made it into a movie theater thanks to my husband R. Umashankar who drove our rental car and juggled his own work and my theater-to-theater rides, and thanks to the helpful volunteers, as an indie author and journalist, I saw every deliberate frame. I watched each stage, setting, every shot - not only for the lead characters or their dialog, but the elements that created that split second of a moment. My favorite films were those that engaged without audacious technology, instead invited the viewer into the narrative most simply. They were hauntingly memorable, much more than I expected. I heard what was said, and what was left out. Then I met those who believed to understand a culture because they learned a language, had traveled to India a handful of times, or knew their naans from their parathas. It was so apparent that they missed everything of value or essence about that culture. Language is not the only thing that makes a culture. Inclusion is not a buzz word. Culture is not a switch. Diversity is not a catch phrase. Our AAPI Heritage lives in us every day. Culture is an inherent lived experience. It starts from the moment one wakes to the minute one drifts off to sleep. I'm opening my calendar for speaking engagements, hands-on writing workshops, and short writing retreats (NorCal, SoCal & South Carolina) starting in Spring 2024. If your community or organization wants to shape powerful narratives where every nuance of every message counts, and you want every member feel seen, heard and appreciated, reach out over dm so we can empower each other with a message that speaks of community and inclusion. Lets talk because it matters more than you think. #sundance #accessibilitymatters #culture #AAJA #diversityequityinclusion #aapi (pic outside Egyptian Theater, after the anniversary screening of Mississippi Masala)\n\nAs someone deeply committed to nurturing creativity and inclusivity, I am incredibly proud to share the launch of our new project, Elevate Voices. This grassroots initiative is particularly close to my heart, as it addresses a significant gap in the film and TV production industries: the underrepresentation of working-class people. Grassroots initiatives like Elevate Voices are vital for empowering communities that are often overlooked and underrepresented. For many working-class individuals, the barriers to entry in creative fields can be daunting. High costs, lack of access to training, and the need for formal qualifications often keep these talented individuals from pursuing their passions. Elevate Voices is designed to break down these barriers. By offering free, accessible workshops and storytelling circles, we aim to create a supportive space where everyone can share their stories, develop new skills, and connect with others. This project is about making sure that everyone, regardless of their background or financial situation, has the opportunity to be heard and seen. I believe in the power of storytelling to bring communities together and drive social change. Elevate Voices will provide a platform for individuals from marginalised groups to express themselves, build confidence, and inspire others. It's initiatives like these that can transform lives and contribute to a more inclusive and diverse creative industry. If you share my passion for empowering communities and believe in the importance of inclusive, grassroots projects, I invite you to support Elevate Voices. Let’s work together to ensure that creativity knows no bounds and that every voice has the opportunity to shine. Thank you the National Lottery, C-Change West London, Cranford Community College and Heston West Big Local for supporting this vision and helping us make a difference. #ElevateVoices #GrassrootsInitiatives #CommunityEmpowerment #CreativeIndustries #Inclusivity #Storytelling #FilmAndTV #UnderrepresentedVoices #NoCostBarriers\n\nThis weekend Juliette Otterburn Hall and I attended the #RealisationFestival at the incredible St Giles House with the purpose of reimagining our futures. The organisers of the festival posit that our task is not cerebral - it’s not about problem solving or policy making but about a new relationship with reality. Realisation can be an ‘aha moment’, a philosophical or spiritual realisation or the manifestation of a goal. Learning can lead to realisations but in many cases we don’t need to acquire more knowledge, rather we need to shift our perspective about what is possible and how things can be done. One of the conversations we’ll be carrying on from the festival is the Future of the Media. Media storytelling plays a critical role in how we make sense of the world and it can either lead us to imagine dystopian futures or it can inspire optimistic, innovative and imaginative futures. What do you think the role of the media should be and what kind changes would you like to see take place to allow for content that generates accessible forms of protopian knowledge through entertainment?"
