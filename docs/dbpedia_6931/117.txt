Together with our customers, Servis develops optimal, cost-effective FM solutions that are suited to the customers’ needs. The key is finding the right balance between the different competencies; security officers on site, Labour & staffing supply and cleaning & maintenance services, and to what extent these solutions should be used. When doing so, it results in optimal solutions for our customers, stronger, more long-term customer relationships and improved profitability.

Servis plays an important role in society through staffing, security services and facilities management, we make a difference by helping people to operate in safe and secure environments where they can thrive and prosper and we believe this is a role that can only grow in importance.

​

The nature of our business and markets in which we operate means that it is our responsibility to make sure that the impact is a positive one.

​

There are many benefits of having an embedded CSR strategy and operating to high ethical standards. CSR helps to attract and retain staff, helps to win business in a competitive environment where we need to stand out from others, and, most of all, it helps to generate pride in the company from everyone connected to it.

The nature of our work and the environments in which we operate expose some of our employees to a high risk of harm.

​

Mitigating and managing these risks so that our people can return home safe every day remains our paramount concern.

​

The group health and safety strategy sets the framework and provides a vision of how each sector can progress from a level of compliance with health and safety regulation to a level of differentiation.

At Servis we strive to create a culture of health and safety in order to create an environment where thinking and acting safely is the norm. Servis continuously builds on its foundations and provides ongoing training and support to all its employees for all staffing purposes.
