        "text": "What is a Service Medal?\n\nA Service Medal is awarded to all those who meet a particular set of criteria. These criteria are usually that an individual has served in a specific area, usually for a specified minimum time between set dates.\n\nThere were a total of six service medals available for men and women who saw military service in the First World War.\n\nSometimes these are misleadingly known as ‘campaign’ medals, which actually refer to medals that were awarded for participating in a particular series of military operations in a certain area with a defined goal. However, these were not awarded in the First World War and are more relevant to medals from other wars such as the Boer or Second World War.\n\nWho might been awarded them?\n\nThe Service Medals were awarded to the servicemen and women who met the criteria. An individual could earn between one and four, but usually received two or three.\n\nWhy were people awarded Service Medals?\n\nMedals have been awarded to commemorate wars and battles throughout history dating back to the Roman Empire. First World War Service Medals indicate that the individual served Britain overseas during the war during a particular period or in a particular role.\n\nOther types of medals include those awarded for bravery, long service, or a specific type of work.\n\nWearing or displaying medals together\n\nThe only medal that could be awarded on its own was the British War Medal. So, if any of the other medals is found on its own, it must be a ‘split group’ i.e. other medals are missing. The British War Medal weighs an ounce; if it alone is missing from a group of medals, it might indicate that it was once pawned or sold for its scrap silver value, and melted down.\n\nMedals should always be worn (or mounted, if displayed) in an ‘order of precedence’. You can find the ‘order of precedence’ list in the Medals Yearbook (details below) . The medal with precedence is on the left of the group when seen by someone meeting the wearer (or looking at a display).\n\nBecause the medals were worn or displayed together, some of the markings can tell us something about any missing medals. The British War Medal is silver, quite a soft medal; it often shows ‘contact marks’ if it has rubbed alongside other medals. Marks to the right of King George V’s head indicate that a Victory Medal was probably also awarded and marks to the left that probably either a 1914 or 1914–15 star was awarded.\n\nNicknames\n\nThe issue of First World War Service Medals in the 1920’s coincided with a comic strip in the Daily Mirror newspaper.\n\nThe popular cartoons featured Pip the dog, Squeak the penguin and Wilfred the rabbit.\n\nSoon the three main campaign medals (the 1914 or 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal) were nicknamed 'Pip, Squeak and Wilfred'.\n\nWhen only the British War and Victory Medals were worn together they became 'Mutt and Jeff' after another pair of cartoon characters.\n\nYour research\n\nMedals can be very useful if you are trying to find out more about the person who received them. To issue and name the medals correctly, extensive records (‘medal rolls’) were compiled. The Army created an index of over 5 million cards - it is the best single source for most people starting First World War family history research, since if a soldier served overseas, they would have been eligible for at least one medal, and so would have an index card. The originals of the medal roll index cards are held at The National Archives (TNA) at Kew and their website gives a comprehensive explanation of what a medal index card can tell you.\n\nThe medal index cards have all been digitised and are available online. You can search the index of the medal roll cards for free through The National Archives website. You can also view the digitised images of the cards themselves for a fee.\n\nThe digital searching can help with tracing where only partial details are known – such as surname and initial, rank or unit, or service number. The Medal Index Cards (or MICs) are a comprehensive and indexed source, usefully bringing together several factual elements, armed with which a researcher can know where next to try.\n\nWhat about the Navy and the Royal Flying Corps/Royal Naval Air Service/Royal Air Force?\n\nThe Navy created ledgers to record the issue of First World War Service Medals, which are also digitised and indexed at the National Archives at Kew.\n\nThere are no RAF medal rolls as such at Kew, although see the sources below for more details. If the ancestor returned from overseas service with the Royal Naval Air Service or the Royal Flying Corps before they merged to form the RAF in April 1918, then they may be listed among the naval or army medal records.\n\nUseful websites and books for further research\n\nWebsites\n\nThe Great War 1914–1918\n\nGeneral introduction to the range of six First World War service medals.\n\nThere is also a good introduction on how to develop researchbased on First World War service medals.\n\nThe Long, Long Trail\n\nIntroduction to the main army medals and help on Interpreting a Medal Index Card.\n\nThe National Archives [TNA]\n\nThe website has lots of great information including an introductory guide to campaign service medals, an explanation of First World War Medal Index cards and general information and tips about how to use archives.\n\nBooks\n\nCopies of all these books can be freely consulted from open shelves at the Explore History Centre at IWM London.\n\nBritish Campaign Medals of the First World War by Peter Duckers\n\n(Shire Publications, Oxford, 2011)\n\nWidely available, also covers some badges and other material often found with medals, and gives guidance on researching in medal records.\n\nThe Medal Yearbook 2012, John W Mussell and editorial team of Medal News\n\n(Token Publishing, Honiton, Devon, 2011)\n\nA comprehensive and widely available introductory work on British medals, published annually. Well illustrated, it is useful for: orders, decorations and medals; ribbons in full colour; order of precedence, for correct mounting. for wear; some foreign awards; as might be seen in groups awarded to British First World War service personnel; adverts for the main medal dealers and medal mounting providers; valuations\n\nGreat War Medal Collectors Companion by Howard Williamson\n\n(Anne Williamson, Harwich, Essex, 2011)\n\nA large reference book that covers the topic in extensive detail, attractively printed in full colour. It covers not just the medals but also the boxes and envelopes of issue, as well as the numbering systems, rank and unit abbreviations, related records, and lines of further research."
