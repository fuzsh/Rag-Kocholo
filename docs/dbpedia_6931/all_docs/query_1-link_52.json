        "meta_description": "WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is further curbing Russia’s access to the international financial system through facilitators and their businesses. The United States, in coordination with the United Kingdom, is targeting the facilitation network of Alisher Usmanov, who is subject to sanctions in multiple jurisdictions. Today’s action also includes designations to reinforce existing measures and further disrupt Russia’s importation of critical technologies used in its war against Ukraine. In total, OFAC is designating 25 individuals and 29 entities with touchpoints in 20 jurisdictions. The U.S. Department of State is concurrently designating several entities operating in the defense sector of the Russian Federation economy and entities supporting Russia’s war against Ukraine, as well as additional entities associated with Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation (Rosatom). For more information on these State actions, see this Fact Sheet. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Commerce will take concurrent action to add 28 entities to its Entity List. “As the Kremlin seeks ways around the expansive multilateral sanctions and export controls imposed on Russia for its war against Ukraine, the United States and our allies and partners will continue to disrupt evasion schemes that support Putin on the battlefield,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Today’s action underscores our dedication to implementing the G7 commitment to impose severe costs on third-country actors who support Russia’s war.” TARGETING USMANOV FACILITATORS Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov (Usmanov), designated on March 3, 2022 pursuant to E.O. 14024, is one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires, with vast holdings across multiple sectors of the Russian Federation economy as well as internationally.

Usmanov is known to be close to multiple U.S.-designated, senior Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Dmitry Medvedev, current Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former President and Prime Minister of Russia. Medvedev has reportedly benefited from the personal use of luxurious residences controlled by Usmanov. Usmanov has at his disposal a wide network of businesses in financial safe havens and family members through which to conduct financial transactions, enabling him to potentially circumvent sanctions. Usmanov has also been sanctioned by Australia, Canada, the European Union (EU), Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (UK). In addition to the actions described below, today OFAC revoked Russia-related General License 15, which had authorized transactions involving any entity owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by Usmanov that was not listed on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). As a result of this revocation, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by Usmanov are blocked, regardless of whether such entities are listed on the SDN List.

The Government of Russia is prepared to dedicate additional resources, including Government of Russia guarantees and subsidies, to save the bank from a looming default. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Bulgaria, Czechia, Romania, and Slovakia ended their participation in the IIB. OFAC also designated Moscow-based Joint Stock Company IIB Capital (IIB Capital), the IIB’s fully owned subsidiary in Russia, and three current or former executives of the IIB:  Russian Federation nationals Nikolay Nikolayevich Kosov (Kosov) and Georgy Nugzarovich Potapov (Potapov) and Hungary national Imre Laszloczki (Laszloczki).

SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the persons above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.  The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please refer to OFAC’s website.  For identifying information on the individuals and entities sanctioned or property identified today, click here. ###",

All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please refer to OFAC’s website.\n\nFor identifying information on the individuals and entities sanctioned or property identified today, click here.\n\n###"
