        "text": "A generation of service and sacrifice\n\nAs we mark 60 years since National Service officially ended we celebrate and remember a generation of men for whom conscription was an everyday part of life growing up.\n\nBetween the end of the Second World War and May 1963, when the last serviceman was demobbed, more than 2 million men took part in National Service.\n\nFollowing the war there was a growing demand for military resources in Britain to retain the Empire and contribute to the occupation of Germany and Japan. Britain was a very different place and low birth rates in the 1930s meant there were fewer young men available for military service.\n\nThe 1947 National Service Act (amended in 1948 and implemented in January 1949) provided a solution to this manpower shortage. It meant that men aged 18â€“26 were required to serve in the Armed Forces for 18 months.\n\nThe roles were varied, with posts in the UK and in British garrisons around the world. From fighting on the front line to working as clerks, carrying out sentry duty or teaching in the Education Corps, it was a task far removed from life at home.\n\nFor many, it was the first time they had lived away from their family, let alone left the country, so National Service provoked mixed emotions."
