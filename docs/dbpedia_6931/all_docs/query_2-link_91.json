        "text": "With demand for hospital treatment outstripping capacityevenbeforeCOVID-19, it is no surprise that the demands of delivering care during a pandemic have led to significant backlogs and longer waits for patients.\n\nThis page provides analysis on capacity in secondary care services and is updated monthly with new data.\n\nLast updated in 8 August 2024\n\nThe latest Referral to Treatment (RTT) figures for June 2024 show:\n\nthe waiting list stood at 7.62 million cases, consisting of approximately 6.39 million individual patients waiting for treatment\n\naround 3.13 million of these patients have been waiting over 18 weeks;\n\nalmost 302,700 of these patients have been waiting over a year for treatment – a slight decrease from around 307,500 the previous month (May 2024)\n\na median waiting time for treatment of 14.3 weeks – almost double the pre-COVID median wait of 7.5 weeks in June 2019.\n\nThe target in the elective backlog recovery plan (February 2022) to eliminate waits longer than 65 weeks by March 2024 has been missed. The longer-running target that 92% of patients should receive treatment within 18 weeks of referral has not been met since September 2015.\n\nNHS England announced in October 2023 that up to 400,000 patients waiting over 40 weeks will be offered the opportunity to travel to a different hospital to be seen sooner. However, many people may feel unable to travel, particularly without support networks.\n\nThe hidden backlog is growing\n\nChanges to cancer waiting times standards came into effect from 1 October 2023 with the following three core measures replacing the previous standards:\n\n28-days wait from an urgent referral to patient told they have cancer standard (75%)\n\n31-days (one month) from a decision to treat to first or subsequent treatment standard (96%)\n\n62-days (two months) wait from an urgent referral or consultant upgrade to a first definitive treatment standard (85%)\n\nDespite the changes in the cancer care targets, services continue to operate well below operational standards.\n\nIn June 2024, the percentage of patients told they have cancer within four weeks (28-days) of an urgent referral decreased slightly from 76.4% the previous month to 76.3% - above the operational target of 75% again after a drop the previous month.\n\nThe percentage of people receiving their first cancer treatment within one month from a decision to treat also decreased – from 91.8% in May to 90.9% in June 2024. This is below the 96% operational standard.\n\nThe percentage of patients receiving their first cancer treatment within two months (62-days) of an urgent referral increased from 65.8% in May to 67.4% in June 2024. This is significantly below the operational standard of 85%.\n\nThe poor performance against these key operational standards illustrates the level of pressure the system is under, and is a clear sign that significant investment in capacity is needed.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, the situation in A&E was increasingly difficult with demand soaring and the percentage of people being seen within the four-hour target reaching an all-time low over the 2019/20 winter.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, A&E attendance decreased significantly which led to performance improvements. However, since lockdown eased demand has steadily risen, reducing performance against targets.\n\nThese pressures on emergency care persist into 2024, despite small improvements in certain areas. Demand for care across all A&E departments remained high in July 2024, with total A&E attendances standing at 2.32 million.\n\n74.6% of people attending A&E were seen within 4 hours in July, which is similar to the previous month. This remains below the target of 76% of patients to be seen within 4 hours – this target was supposed to be hit by March 2024. In the past 12 months (from August 2023 to July 2024, approximately 1.65 million people have waited more than 4 hours in A&E.\n\nNHSE introduced three new targets as part the Urgent and Emergency Care capital incentive scheme. The trusts that are on track to meet these targets based on their performance will be eligible to receive additional capital funding in 2024-25.\n\nThese include:\n\n1. The 10 trusts delivering the highest level of 4-hour performance during March will each receive £2 million.\n\n2. The 10 trusts who deliver the greatest percentage point improvement in March (compared to January 2024 performance) will each receive £2 million.\n\n3. The next 10 trusts who deliver the greatest percentage point improvement in March (compared to January 2024 performance) would each receive £1 million.\n\nThe BMA has raised concerns regarding the introduction of the capital incentive scheme, on the basis that it risks creating perverse incentives for Trusts, diverting support away from where it is needed most, and widening existing health inequalities.\n\nWaiting times have rocketed\n\nThe combination of ongoing pressure on services, the backlog of care and chronic workforce shortages means waiting times have increased to record highs.\n\nThe total number of patients waiting over 12 hours for an emergency admission decreased slightly from about 38,100 in June to approximately 36,800 in July 2024. The number of patients waiting over 12 hours for an emergency admission in July 2024 was around 81 times higher than in July 2019 – pre-pandemic. Note that this number represents an underestimate of actual waiting times, as patients will have been waiting for additional time before a ‘decision to admit’ was made.\n\nThese long waiting times are, in part, due to poor patient flow. General and acute bed occupancy has consistently been at over 90% since September 2021, and patients regularly remain in hospital despite being fit for discharge because there is no capacity for them in social care.\n\nWe can track GP referrals into consultant-led outpatient services alongside the waves of COVID-19: as the waves have peaked, referrals into secondary care have dropped. These drops are likely due to a combination of changes to patient behaviour alongside capacity issues in secondary care effectively forcing GPs to take a more cautious approach with timings of referrals to avoid having referrals rejected.\n\nGPs can still refer patients, but the pressures in hospitals means there is little capacity in secondary care, and those referrals are often rejected.\n\nThe number of GP referrals to consultant-led outpatient services that have been unsuccessful because there are no slots available has jumped from 238,859 in February 2020 to a staggering 401,115 in November 2021 (an 87% increase).\n\nWhen GPs are unable to refer into hospital services, the care for these patients does not disappear. Instead, these patients need to be cared for by GPs while they wait for hospital treatment to go ahead, adding to the pressure in primary care."
