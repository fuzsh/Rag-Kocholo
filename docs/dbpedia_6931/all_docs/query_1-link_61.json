The List is central to EOIR’s efforts to improve the amount and quality of representation before its adjudicators, and it is an essential tool to inform individuals in proceedings before EOIR of available pro bono legal services. The rules for qualifying organizations, pro bono referral services, and attorneys to be placed on the List can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.61 et seq. (80 Fed. Reg. 59503).\n\nThe List is provided to individuals in immigration proceedings and contains information on non-profit organizations and attorneys who have committed to providing at least 50 hours per year of pro bono legal services before the immigration court location where they appear on the List. The List also contains information on pro bono referral services that refer individuals in immigration court proceedings to pro bono counsel.\n\nCHANGES TO THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING LIST OF FREE LEGAL SERVICES\n\nOn October 1, 2015 the Department amended the regulations governing the former List of Free Legal Services Providers at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.61 et seq. The amendments renamed the List as the “List of Pro Bono Legal Service Providers” and significantly revised the requirements for providers to be placed on the List. Amendments to the rule include: requiring organizations and attorneys to provide at least 50 hours a year of pro bono legal services at each immigration court where they appear on the list, permitting public comment on pending qualified applicants to be placed on the List; and, imposing a recertification of providers every 3 years from the date of approval on the List. For a copy of the final rule in the Federal Register, click here.\n\nProviders placed on the List of Free Legal Services Providers prior to November 30, 2015, the effective date of the amended rule, must reapply to be placed on the List of Pro Bono Legal Service Providers. Failure to reapply within the required time period will result in the removal of the provider’s name from the List. Click here for further information.\n\nAttorneys must reapply within 6 months of the effective date or by May 30, 2016.\n\nOrganizations and referral services must reapply within a year of the effective date or by November 30, 2016.\n\nMEANING OF \"PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES\"\n\nPro Bono legal services are “those uncompensated legal services performed for indigent aliens or the public good without any expectation of either direct or indirect remuneration, including referral fees (other than filing fees or photocopying and mailing expenses).” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.61(a)(2). The List is not to be used by organizations or attorneys for the purpose of solicitation for paid legal services.\n\nTO APPLY:\n\nVisit the Pro Bono Portal to apply online.
