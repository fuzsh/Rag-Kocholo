The company started out as a manufacturer, but fell into difficulties in the 1980s. From 1991 to 2008, the brand was owned and manufactured by Italian white goods company Antonio Merloni SpA. Antonio Merloni entered administration in 2008 and ceased manufacturing Servis appliances. In 2011, the brand was sold to Turkish white goods and TV manufacturer Vestel who relaunched the brand in 2012.",
