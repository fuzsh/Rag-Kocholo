        "text": "MI6, British government agency responsible for the collection, analysis, and appropriate dissemination of foreign intelligence. MI6 is also charged with the conduct of espionage activities outside British territory. It has existed in various forms since the establishment of a secret service in 1569 by Sir Francis Walsingham, who became secretary of state to Queen Elizabeth I. It was constituted in its present form in 1912 by Commander (later Sir) Mansfield Cumming as part of Britain’s attempt to coordinate intelligence activities prior to the outbreak of World War I. In the 1930s and ’40s it was considered the most effective intelligence service in the world. Following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler in Germany, MI6 conducted espionage operations in Europe, Latin America, and much of Asia. (The name “MI6” label originated during this period, when the agency was “section six” of military intelligence.)\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II, MI6 helped to train personnel of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services; it has since cooperated with the OSS’s successor, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In the mid-1950s, the British public reacted with consternation when it was revealed that MI6 had been penetrated by British double agents who had served the Soviet Union since the 1930s. Details of MI6 operations and relationships seldom appeared in the British press until the 1990s, when the previously secretive organization publicly named its head for the first time. Nevertheless, information about MI6 is still much more closely guarded than that about MI5, which carries out internal security and domestic counterintelligence activities. The agency has the power to censor news accounts of its activities through the use of “D” notices under the Official Secrets Act. MI6 reports to the Foreign Office."
