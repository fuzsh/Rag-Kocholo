        "text": "Follow our live blog for the latest UK election news\n\nLive 2024 general election results mapped\n\nRishi Sunak has vowed to bring back National Service for 18-year-olds. Under the mandatory scheme, teenagers will have to enrol in the military for 12 months – or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community.\n\nA new Royal Commission will design the programme, with a pilot scheme opening for applications in September 2025, ahead of a national rollout by 2029.\n\nHere, The Telegraph takes a look at some key questions about the plans.\n\nWhat is National Service?\n\nNational Service was introduced in the UK in 1949, with all physically fit males aged 17 and 21 having to serve in the Armed Forces initially for 18 months, but lengthened to two years in 1950.\n\nThey then remained on the reserve list for another four years and during this time they could be called on to serve with their units but on no more than three occasions for a maximum of 20 days.\n\nUnder Rishi Sunak’s modern scheme, teenagers will be given the choice of enrolling in the military for 12 months – or undertaking a period of volunteering in their community.\n\nWhen did UK national service end?\n\nNational Service officially ended in 1960 although periods of deferred service still had to be completed. The last national servicemen were discharged in 1963.\n\nWhat ages will have to participate?\n\nUnder Tory plans, school leavers aged 18 would be required to participate in the scheme.\n\nWill 18-year-olds at university be exempt or allowed to defer?\n\nNo. Everyone will have to do National Service and fit it around their lives. There will be very limited deferments and none for university students.\n\nWhat sanctions could people face for refusing National Service?\n\nDuring a BBC Question Time special on June 20, Mr Sunak suggested teenagers who refuse National Service could forfeit their driving licence.\n\nAsked what sanctions could be implemented to force those who did not want to take part in the scheme to participate, the Prime Minister said: “You’ll have a set of sanctions, and incentives, and we will look at the models that are existing around Europe for the appropriate mix of those.\n\n“There’s all sorts of things across Europe, whether that’s looking at driving licenses, other access to finance, all sorts of other things.”\n\nHe added: “There’s a range of things, and we will have a Royal Commission look at all of those, come back to the Government and recommend what the appropriate mix of incentives and sanctions is.”\n\nWhat if the young person has a job?\n\nThere will be no exemption for those who are in work.\n\nWhat if they are on a gap year abroad?\n\nThis will not be a reason for exemption and those abroad will be expected to do their National Service alongside any travel.\n\nWhat if they already work in the emergency services, prison or care sectors?\n\nThe Royal Commission will look at exemptions, including where people are already working in the military. But the starting point remains that all people serve.\n\nWhat if the young person has unpaid caring commitments?\n\nThe Royal Commission will aim to ensure everyone can take part.\n\nWeekend placements could be within the NHS, fire or police service, or with charities supporting older people or tackling loneliness.\n\nWill the royal children be expected to take part?\n\nYes – everyone will be expected to undergo National Service.\n\nPrince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, nine, and Prince Louis, six, would not be exempt, the Conservative Party told The Telegraph.\n\nPrincesses Beatrice and Eugenie also have young children who would be eligible to take part once they reach 18 as well as Prince Edward’s son, the Earl of Wessex, who is 16.\n\nWill the scheme apply in Northern Ireland?\n\nYes – although the Royal Commission will consider how to manage any sensitivities surrounding National Service.\n\nWhat if not enough people apply for the military placement?\n\nThe Tories have argued similar schemes in other countries have a very high take-up rate, suggesting they don’t expect this to be a problem.\n\nFor example, in Scandinavian countries, winning military service programme is highly competitive.\n\nIn Norway, 9,840 conscripts were accepted last year; roughly 17 per cent of the available cohort. Around a quarter go on to pursue a career in the armed forces.\n\nThere would be a proposed 30,000 places available in the Armed Forces, which represents only about four per cent of 18-year-olds according to today’s figures."
