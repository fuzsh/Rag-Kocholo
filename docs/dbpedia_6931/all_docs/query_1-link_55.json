Not all products are approved in all regulatory jurisdictions. The product information on these websites is intended only for licensed physicians and healthcare professionals.\n\nMedical Devices for Minimally Invasive Procedures\n\nThere are common themes across every medical specialty we support: patients who want to get better and doctors who want simpler, more effective options. That is why we work hard to invent, manufacture, and deliver a unique portfolio of minimally invasive medical devices to healthcare systems around the world."
