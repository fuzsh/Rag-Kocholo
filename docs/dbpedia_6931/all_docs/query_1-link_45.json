        "text": "If an F-1 student with an Active SEVIS record wants to transfer to another school, what obligations does that student have?\n\nThe student must maintain F-1 status at your school by pursuing a full course of study or be engaged in post-completion optional practical training (OPT) until the transfer release date.\n\nThe student must be accepted by another SEVP-certified school. The student should bring you the following information:\n\nWritten confirmation of the acceptance\n\nContact information for the new school’s DSO\n\nThe SEVIS school code for the transfer-in school to ensure transfer to the correct school\n\nWork with the student to choose a transfer release date. Base that date on the student’s academic needs, travel and work plans and projected program start date at the transfer-in school.\n\nA transferring student must also contact the new DSO within 15 days of the program start date and register for classes. These students need to ensure that the DSO at the transfer-in school has all the information needed to update the SEVIS record, including any change of address. Advise the transferring student to contact the DSO at the transfer-in school. The DSO at the transfer-in school will be able to create a Form I-20 issued for the reason of transfer. Once a transfer student registers, the student should ask for a Form I-20 that shows the status as a continuing student and that the transfer is approved.\n\nOn the transfer release date, the responsibility for the student’s SEVIS record transfers to the DSO at the transfer-in school. You can no longer have access to the record to make changes or print a new Form I-20. Your school will have a Deactivated record for the student.\n\nThis Form I-20 will have the student’s new program start date. It is important that the student get a new valid Form I-20 as quickly as possible. The Form I-20 from your school will no longer be valid.\n\nWhat are the choices for an F-1 student with a Terminated SEVIS record who wants to transfer to another school?\n\nThe student has three choices:\n\nApply to USCIS for reinstatement before transferring to another school.\n\nThe student must continue to maintain a full course of study and otherwise abide by the regulations governing F-1 students while USCIS adjudicates the reinstatement. See the USCIS website for information on how to file for reinstatement.\n\nIf USCIS denies the reinstatement application, the student must leave the United States immediately or risk being placed in removal proceedings at any time under §237(a)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended.\n\nRequest that you transfer the Terminated record to the transfer-in school.\n\nYou will need confirmation that the student received acceptance to the new school. On the transfer release date, the transfer-in DSO becomes responsible for the student’s SEVIS record, making the recommendation for reinstatement on the student’s SEVIS record, and issuing the student a new Form I-20 for the reason of reinstatement.\n\nThe student will be responsible for properly filing for reinstatement with USCIS or submitting their new Form I-20 to USCIS if they have a pending reinstatement application at the time of the transfer. The student must intend to pursue a full course of study at the next available term or within five months, whichever is earlier, at the transfer-in school (8 CFR 214.2 (f)(16)(i)(C)). The only exception is that if the student’s SEVIS record was erroneously Terminated, the transfer-in DSO may instead seek a data fix through the SEVP Response Center.\n\nThe student must begin to attend the transfer-in school in the next available session even if USCIS has not yet adjudicated the application for reinstatement or if the SEVIS record has not been fixed yet. If USCIS denies the reinstatement application, the student must depart the United States.\n\nGet an Initial Form I-20 from the new school.\n\nThe student must exit the United States and return as an initial entry in a new F-1 nonimmigrant status (initial admission). A student who chooses this option must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee. The student will also lose credit for any time accumulated toward qualification for benefits such as optional or curricular practical training (CPT).\n\nIf the student’s visa is valid, the student does not need a new visa. If the student has a Terminated record because of a failure to maintain status or has violated any provision of the INA, as amended, the student may be denied re-entry to the United States under §212(a)(6)(G) of the INA, as amended.\n\nIf a new Initial F-1 student wants to transfer to another school, what must happen?\n\nAs with any Initial student, the student must report to your school by the program start date listed on the Form I-20 (in person or via e-mail, telephone and/or fax).\n\nFor any F-1 transfer, the student first must provide written verification of acceptance at another SEVP-certified school. The options depend on the program start date and when the student enters (or plans to enter) the United States.\n\nIf the student has received acceptance by another SEVP-certified school with a program start date fewer than 30 days before or after the student’s initial admission into the United States, you must transfer the student’s SEVIS record. Follow the directions in the next question for transferring an Initial record.\n\nIf the student does not have a program start date at the transfer-in school within 30 days of the initial admission into the United States, the student may do one of the following:\n\nEnroll for a full course of study at the transfer-out school. Once the student’s record is Active, the student may request a transfer following the procedures above.\n\nWithdraw acceptance to your school and then leave the United States and get a new Form I-20 from the DSO at the school the student wants to attend. After leaving the United States, the student must pay the I-901 SEVIS Fee for the new school. Since the student entered the United States and reported to a DSO at your school, you must make the record Active and then terminate it for authorized early withdrawal. The student must exit the United States within 15 days. Use this option only if you know the student plans to leave the United States.\n\nThe student may ask to have the DSO transfer the Terminated record if all three of the following conditions exist:\n\nThe student does not choose one of the options above\n\nThe student fails to enroll for classes\n\nYou have terminated the student’s SEVIS record for Failure to Enroll\n\nHow do I transfer an Initial SEVIS record?\n\nSEVIS functionality requires that you make the student’s record Active in SEVIS in order to release the record to the transfer-in school.\n\nFor the current session end date, use today’s date. For the next session start date, use tomorrow’s date. Select the Transfer Out function and use tomorrow’s date as the transfer release date. Write \"Transfer of initial student not enrolled at this school\" in the remarks.\n\nYou can make a student’s SEVIS record Active solely for the purpose of initiating a transfer. ICE does not (and will not) view this as registering the student. In this circumstance, the SEVIS record clearly indicates the student properly reported to your school and that you properly initiated an immediate transfer of the student’s SEVIS record. It does not indicate that the student enrolled in classes.\n\nHow long must a student with an Active SEVIS record wait between ending classes at a transfer-out school and starting classes at a transfer-in school?\n\nThis depends on the student’s circumstances. According to 8 CFR 214.2(f)(8)(ii)(C), the DSO at the transfer-out school controls the student’s SEVIS record until the transfer release date.\n\nIf classes are in session, the student must attend classes and otherwise maintain status until the transfer release date.\n\nOn the transfer release date, the DSO at the transfer-in school controls the student’s SEVIS record. The student must begin classes at the transfer-in school at the next available term or within five months, whichever is sooner, unless taking an authorized break or vacation during that term.\n\nIf the next available term does not start within five months of the last date of school attendance or program completion date at the transfer-out school (whichever is earlier), the student must depart the United States until able to begin the new program. The DSO will not handle this as a transfer. The student will get a new SEVIS record and the DSO will send the student an Initial attendance Form I-20. The student must then pay the I-901 SEVIS fee and apply for a new F-1 visa, if required.\n\nHow long must a new Initial student wait before attending classes at a new school?\n\nA new Initial student can transfer only if the student has a program start date within 30 days of arrival in the United States. See the question above on transferring Initial students.\n\nHow long can a student with a Terminated SEVIS record wait between ending classes at a transfer-out school and starting classes at a transfer-in...\n\nHow long can a student with a Terminated SEVIS record wait between ending classes at a transfer-out school and starting classes at a transfer-in school?\n\nA transfer student with a Terminated record must report to the DSO at the transfer-in school no later than 15 days before the program start date for the next available term. The student must take a full course of study even if USCIS has not adjudicated the reinstatement application.\n\nThe student may want to report on the record release date so that they can file a timely reinstatement application or obtain an updated Form I-20 if a reinstatement application has already been filed.\n\nAdvise the student to contact the DSO at the transfer-in school as soon as possible after the transfer release date. The student should be sure to do the following:\n\nEnsure that the DSO has all information needed to update the SEVIS record\n\nRequest a copy of the new Form I-20 reflecting the transfer and the new program start date (Block 3 on the Form I-20 will show a pending transfer from the transfer-out school )\n\nWhen does a student report to a new school?\n\nThe student must report to the school no later than 15 days before the program start date.\n\nI have a prospective Initial student who wants to attend summer school at another SEVP-certified school and then attend my school for the fall term...\n\nI have a prospective Initial student who wants to attend summer school at another SEVP-certified school and then attend my school for the fall term. Who should issue the Form I-20?\n\nIt is important to note that a student with a new Initial SEVIS record must report first to the school listed on the Form I-20 and visa, if applicable.\n\nTherefore, the DSO at the summer school should issue the Form I-20. You may provide the student with a letter explaining that your school has accepted the student and that the student intends to transfer to your school after completing summer school. Provide the necessary financial information. The U.S. Embassy or Consulate can use this information in conjunction with the information from the summer school to make a visa issuance decision.\n\nAfter initial admission, the student must report to the summer school, as this is the school on the visa. The DSO at that school can then initiate a transfer to your school for the fall term.\n\nNote that a new Initial student must enroll full-time for the student’s first term, even if it is a summer session.\n\nMust I transfer the record of a continuing student who participates in a summer program or camp at another SEVP-certified school?\n\nNo. If the student is earning credit, treat this as a concurrent enrollment. If not, this is a recreational summer activity. While you do not have to report recreational activities in SEVIS, it is a good idea to make a remark in the student’s record and issue an updated Form I-20. Be sure to update the student’s address in SEVIS.\n\nMay a student at an SEVP-certified school participate in a summer camp or summer program that is not at an SEVP-certified school?\n\nYes. If the student has remained enrolled full-time during the regular academic year, this is a recreational summer break activity. However, the student cannot use any credits earned from a school that is not SEVP-certified to count toward full-time enrollment.\n\nIt is a good idea to make a remark in the student’s record and issue an updated Form I-20. Be sure to update the student’s address in SEVIS.\n\nWhat should I do if an F-1 student who is transferring from our school (School A) to another school (School B) in the fall wants to take a summer...\n\nWhat should I do if an F-1 student who is transferring from our school (School A) to another school (School B) in the fall wants to take a summer term at a third SEVP-certified school (School C)?\n\nIn this situation, DSOs have four options:\n\nTransfer only – Transfer the student from school A to school C for the summer; transfer the student from school C to school B for the fall\n\nConcurrent enrollment – If the study at school C can be construed as contributing to the program of study the student is enrolled in at school A, study at school C could be accepted as concurrent enrollment. The student would remain enrolled at school A throughout the summer while taking classes at school C; school C would have reporting responsibilities to school A. School A can use the end date of the summer session as the next session end date and schedule the transfer release date after the summer session. Use the remarks field in SEVIS to note the name of the summer school and that the student is attending a summer session there as concurrent enrollment.\n\nIncident to status study, pending transfer. F-1 transfer students are considered to be maintaining status during the timeframe between completion of one program of study and the start a new program of study (does not apply if the timeframe exceeds 5 months). If an F-1 student is planning to take coursework at school C during this summer session, the study may be considered incident to status. In this instance a SEVIS transfer to school C for that summer session would not be required.\n\nIncident to status study, summer vacation. If the student is entitled to summer vacation, he/she may study at school C incident to status during the summer. If this option is chosen, no action should be taken to initiate transfer from school A to school B until study at school C is completed.\n\nIn all of these situations, a student should provide the DSO at the school having jurisdiction over the student’s SEVIS record with any address changes or other material changes. Additionally, the DSO at the school having jurisdiction over the student’s SEVIS record should use the remarks field in SEVIS to clarify the student’s situation.\n\nThese options do not apply to F-1 students authorized for practical training unless they plan to terminate their practical training early."
