        "text": "This is a guide to finding records of soldiers who served with the British Army in the Second World War. The ranks covered include Private, Lance Corporal, Corporal, Sergeant, and Warrant Officer – but not commissioned officer ranks.Most British Army service records from the Second World War have only recently been transferred from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to The National Archives as part of the Ministry of Defence service records project. The scale of this transfer means that not all of the millions of records transferred are yet searchable in our catalogue or viewable in our reading rooms.\n\nRefer to our guide to Women in the British army for information on ATS records.\n\nThere are three types of records which should exists for most soldiers and it usually makes sense to begin by searching for these (advice on how and where to search appears later in the guide):\n\nService records: Usually the most detailed record of a soldier’s time in the army.\n\nMedal and honours records: Most soldiers were issued with campaign medals awarded for service during conflict; some soldiers were also awarded medals for acts of gallantry and meritorious service.\n\nUnit war diaries: You will need to know which unit, often a battalion, a soldier served with to effectively search these records; in most diaries only officers are mentioned by name.\n\nWhether other records survive or ever existed for a soldier depend upon a number of variable factors. If, for example, a soldier was wounded, or imprisoned as a POW or received an army pension, there may be records for these.\n\nOf all the possible records that may exist for a soldier, only a small proportion are viewable online:\n\nRecommendations for military honours and awards, 1935–1990 (see ‘Medals and honours’ section)\n\nAnnouncements of the award of gallantry medals and honours (see ‘Medals and honours’ section)\n\nBritish Army casualty lists, 1939–1945 (see ‘Other records’ section)\n\nNo service records are yet viewable online.\n\nMany of the records covered in this guide contain a lot of obscure military abbreviations and acronyms and can be hard to decipher as a result. There are, however, some resources available online and at our library in Kew that can help you to interpret them.\n\nThis official list of MOD Acronyms and Abbreviations published on the GOV.UK site contains thousands of terms in current use but many were in use during the Second World War. The Government of Canada also publishes a list of military abbreviations used in service files, many of which are applicable to British records.\n\nThough not affiliated with The National Archives, the independent Researching the Lives and Records of WW2 Soldiers website also contains a very useful list of Second World War abbreviations and acronyms.\n\nThe following books are available at our library in Kew:\n\nA Dictionary of Military and Technological Abbreviations and Acronyms by Bernhard Pretz\n\nRoyal Artillery: Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations (Historical and Modern) by Philip Jobson\n\nA service record is usually the most detailed record of a soldier’s time in the army. The types of documents that are most commonly found within service records are:\n\nAttestation forms – documents signed when first recruited or upon transfer between units\n\nStatement of service – outlining an individual’s postings whilst in service\n\nDischarge forms – issued when a soldier left the regiment\n\nSupporting correspondence of a wide variety\n\nThe vast scale of the recent transfer of British Army Second World War service records from the MOD to The National Archives means that only a small proportion are searchable in our catalogue or viewable in our reading rooms. You should try to locate a document reference for a service record yourself first and if you are unable to we will try to locate it for you. Once you have a document reference you can order a copy of the record.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Search our catalogue by surname, service number or date of birth, or by a combination of any of these, or use the search box below:\n\nDetails of individual:\n\nInitials\n\nLast name\n\nService number\n\nDate of birth (D or DD, name of month, YYYY)\n\nSearch tips:\n\nIf you have a service number, try searching with that alone\n\nTry different formats for dates of birth, particularly for the day of birth (1 July 1910 and 01 July 1910)\n\nTry variations on the spelling of the last name\n\nIf you locate a document reference whose description matches the details you are looking for, you can request a copy of the record directly from the catalogue.\n\nStep 2: If you are unable to find a record at Step 1, submit a a Freedom of Information (FOI) application to request a search for and access to the record using one of the following three forms (charges may apply):\n\nForm 1: Request your own record if you were born before or in 1939 (or if you are doing this on behalf of someone)\n\nForm 2: Request military service records for a person born before 1909\n\nForm 3: Request military service records for a person born between 1909 and 1939\n\nScots Guards regiment\n\nThe Scots Guards retain their own records in their own archive. To apply for a Scots Guard service record from before or after 1945, call, email or write to their Regimental Archives.\n\nCampaign medal records\n\nContact the Ministry of Defence Medal Office for records of Second World War and post-Second World War campaign medals. There are also details of how to apply for a medal if you meet the criteria.\n\nRecommendations for military honours and awards, 1935–1990\n\nA recommendation is a full statement, usually supplied by a commanding officer, of why a medal or any other honour should be awarded to an individual. Each recommendation provides a detailed summary of the action or deed carried out by the person who earned the award. Search for online images of recommendations for military honours and awards (£) (WO 373) on our website.\n\nAnnouncements of the award of gallantry medals and honours\n\nAlmost all gallantry awards to British nationals are publicly announced in the official government newspaper, the London Gazette. This public announcement is often the only record that survives of an award. Search the London Gazette on The Gazette website for the official announcements of British Army soldiers’ gallantry awards.\n\nAll units, from battalions and brigades to divisions and whole armies, maintained a daily record of events. Though they do not always record details of individual soldiers, they provide a timeline and details of the operations, actions and movements of a soldier’s unit.\n\nTo search for diaries, read the advice in our guide to records of British Army operations in the Second World War on unit war diaries. You will need to know which unit, often a battalion, a soldier served with to effectively search these records.\n\nTo access these records you will either need to visit us, pay for research (£) or, where you can identify a specific record reference, order a copy (£).\n\nThis section covers other records of British Army soldiers held at The National Archives and some of the other official records of individuals held by other archives and organisations.\n\nBritish Army casualty lists, 1939–1945\n\nSearch the online daily British Army casualty lists (WO 417) on Findmypast.co.uk (£). These cover British Army officers, other ranks and nurses. They state the individuals’ rank, service number, date of becoming a casualty and type of casualty. It sometimes gives the unit/battalion number – you can use this to locate a unit war diary.\n\nThe term ‘casualty’ covers anyone in the British Army who was killed, wounded, missing, or was a prisoner of war.\n\nGrenadier Guards registers and papers\n\nSearch in WO 437 by record type and year range for various records of Grenadier Guards, including:\n\ndischarge registers\n\nregisters of deserters\n\nattestation forms\n\nenlistment registers\n\nmuster rolls and pay lists\n\ndescription books\n\nThe series covers records from the middle of the 18th century onwards.

The individuals included in this collection had deserted the Free French and were eventually integrated as a Pioneer Company in the British Army.\n\nSearch WO 426 by surname, service number and year of birth for the available records.\n\nSoldiers’ effects ledgers, 1901–1960\n\nSearch the soldiers’ effects ledgers (£) covering April 1901 to March 1960 (from The National Army Museum) by name or regiment on Ancestry.co.uk. These list monies owed to a soldier who died in service.\n\nYou may be able to purchase a transcript from the ledgers which usually show\n\nfull name\n\nregimental number\n\ndate, and sometimes place, of death\n\nnext of kin and monies paid to them\n\nLedgers from 1901 to 1914 also show the soldier’s trade and date of enlistment.\n\nCourts martial registers\n\nBritish Army courts martial registers covering the Second World War are held at The National Archives and contain the name, rank, regiment, place of trial, nature of charge and sentence for each prisoner. There are several series of records containing registers for courts martial held in the United Kingdom and overseas (‘Home’ and ‘Abroad’). Click on the series references below and search by year:\n\nWO 86 (1829-1979) – District Courts Martial registers (Home and Abroad)\n\nWO 90 (1796-1960) – General Courts Martial registers (Abroad)\n\nWO 92 (1666-1704, 1806-1960) – General Courts Martial registers (Home)\n\nWO 213 (1909-1963) – Field General Courts Martial and military courts registers (Home and Abroad)\n\nFor more advice see our guide to British Army courts martial records.\n\nAbsent Voters Lists, 1918–1925 and 1939\n\nSearch for a soldier by name in the Absent Voters Lists, taken from electoral registers held at the British Library, on Ancestry.co.uk (£) and Findmypast.co.uk (£).\n\nThe Absent Voter Lists enabled servicemen and women away from home to vote by proxy or by postal application. They record the address, service number and regimental details of each person."
