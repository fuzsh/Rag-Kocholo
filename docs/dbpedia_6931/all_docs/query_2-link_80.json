        "text": "What is long COVID?\n\nMost people with COVID-19 feel better within a few days or weeks of their first symptoms and make a full recovery within 12 weeks.\n\nFor some people, symptoms can last longer. This is called long COVID or post COVID-19 syndrome. Long COVID is a new condition which is still being studied.\n\nRead about long COVID research studies on the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) website.\n\nInformation:\n\nYou can sign up to take part in long COVID research on the Be Part of Research website\n\nWhat happens at your GP appointment\n\nIf you see a GP about ongoing COVID-19 symptoms, they may suggest tests to find out more about your symptoms and rule out other conditions that could cause them.\n\nThese tests might include:\n\nblood tests\n\nchecking your blood pressure and heart rate\n\na chest X-ray\n\nmeasuring your oxygen levels\n\nThe GP will talk to you about the care and support you might need.\n\nYou may be given advice about how to manage and monitor your symptoms at home.\n\nHow to help symptoms of long COVID yourself\n\nA lot is still being learned about long COVID. But there are things you can do to help with the symptoms.\n\nTiredness and fatigue\n\nIf long COVID is causing tiredness or fatigue, there may be things you can do to help, such as avoiding drinking too much alcohol and sticking to the same sleep times every day.\n\nKeeping a diary of your day, how you slept, and your tiredness and fatigue symptoms may help you to understand if anything is making it worse. These things are sometimes called triggers.\n\nRead more about tiredness and fatigue, including things you can do to help.\n\nEating a balanced diet\n\nIt’s important to eat well if you have long COVID because this helps you get better and stronger quicker.\n\nRead more about eating a balanced diet.\n\nExercise\n\nThe amount of exercise you can do will depend on how you are feeling.\n\nIt's a good idea to speak to a GP for advice before starting a new exercise programme if your symptoms are severe or you have not exercised in a while.\n\nIt can help to start small and listen to your body. For example:\n\nstand up every hour\n\ntry some breathing exercises\n\nmove your joints\n\nset realistic exercise targets\n\ndo not do too much, and stop if you feel unwell\n\ndrink plenty of water to avoid dehydration (your pee should be light yellow or clear)\n\nTry not to stay in bed or sit for too long. Get up regularly and go for short walks if you can. If this is something you are struggling with, speak to your GP or long COVID clinic.\n\nDepression, anxiety and mental health\n\nIf you have mental health symptoms, such as anxiety or depression, find out how you can access NHS mental health support services.\n\nYou can also read more about 5 steps you can take to improve your mental health and wellbeing.\n\nBreathlessness\n\nLong COVID can cause breathlessness and a change in your usual breathing pattern. Breathing exercises can help to get your normal breathing pattern back.\n\nThis can include:\n\nbreathing in through your nose gently and at a steady rate\n\ntrying to avoid shallow breathing and breathe in gradually and more deeply\n\nYou may need to see a physiotherapist for help with breathlessness. This may be available through a long COVID service.\n\nDifficulty concentrating (brain fog)\n\nSome people with long COVID have difficulty concentrating, managing lots of information at once, or remembering things. This is sometimes called brain fog.\n\nYou should discuss this symptom with your GP if it is a constant or severe problem or getting worse.\n\nHeart palpitations or dizziness\n\nYour heartbeat may feel different to normal when you’re recovering from an illness, but this should settle as you recover.\n\nTo help with palpitations or dizziness, you can:\n\nmove slowly when you’re sitting or standing\n\ndo some gentle activity – you may find it easier to exercise in a lying position\n\nInformation:\n\nIf you’re worried about heart palpitations or dizziness, speak to a GP or NHS 111.\n\nReturning to work or carer roles\n\nIf long covid is having an impact on your usual ability to manage your work or caring role, discuss this with your doctor and employer.\n\nRead more about support and benefits for carers.\n\nMore information\n\nGOV.UK: Find help and support if you have long COVID\n\nLong COVID SOS: Resources about long COVID"
