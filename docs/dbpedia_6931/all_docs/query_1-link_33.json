        "text": "OPT\n\nFor students engaged in post-secondary schools or at conservatories. Twelve months of Regular OPT is available for each higher level of study. (For example a student may have 12 months for a bachelor’s degree and another 12 months for a master’s degree.)\n\nPre-Completion OPT: Any portion of OPT used before the student’s Program End Date. It may be part-time or full-time.\n\nPost-Completion OPT: Any portion of OPT used after the student’s Program End Date. It must be at least 20 hours per week or full-time.\n\n4\n\nUpon receipt of the Form I-765, USCIS issues a Receipt Notice (Form I-797) that contains the receipt number assigned to the case.\n\nThrough an interface with USCIS, the status of the OPT request in SEVIS changes to Pending.\n\nIf USCIS needs more information, the student will receive a Request For Evidence (RFE), which states what information is needed and the deadline for submitting it. The student must respond by the deadline.\n\nUSCIS then makes a decision on the application:\n\nIf the application is approved, USCIS issues an EAD and the OPT Request status in SEVIS changes to Approved.\n\nIf the Form I-765 is denied, the OPT Request status in SEVIS changes to Denied.\n\nThe student has met or will meet the one full academic year requirement by the employment start date.\n\nClick the checkbox to indicate the student has met the enrollment requirement.\n\nThis is a required field.\n\n*Start Date\n\nThe date that OPT authorization starts.\n\nThis date cannot be before the student has completed one academic year of full-time study\n\nA student can split their OPT time between degree programs at the same education level (for example, they intend to use six months of OPT after completing a master of fine arts degree and the remaining six months of OPT after completing a master of music degree).\n\nThe requested OPT validity dates for each particular degree program should be limited to the planned duration of OPT for that program. If the student would like to request less than the maximum validity period of post-completion OPT available for each degree program, you should explicitly note in SEVIS that the student is requesting to split their OPT time.\n\nIf you initially request 12 months of OPT based on one degree program, the student will be unable to later request OPT based on a different degree program at the same education level.\n\n​Format: MM/DD/YYYY.\n\nPost-Completion OPT: Start Date must be on or after the Program End Date. It cannot be more than 60 days after the Program End Date.\n\nThis is a required field.\n\nStudent Remarks\n\nEnter or update remarks regarding the student’s planned employment. Use this field to convey important information you think the student or government officials need to know. USCIS has noted they want to see how the planned employment relates to the student’s major course of study. For example: student will pursue training .related to studies.\n\nThis field is limited to 1,000 characters.\n\nNote: Comments entered here overwrite any existing remarks that print in the Remarks field on Page 1 of the Form I-20. *The student has met or will meet the one full academic year requirement by the employment start date.\n\nClick the checkbox to indicate the student has met the enrollment requirement.\n\nThis is a required field."
