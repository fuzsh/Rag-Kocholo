        "text": "The cheapest way to get around is by using a Visitor Oyster Card, a pre-paid electronic card that can be used on buses, the tube, the tram and most rail services within London’s travel fare zones (zones 1 to 6). You can save time by ordering your card before you arrive.\n\nOne-day paper travelcards (which cover bus, tube and inner-city rail services) are also available from all London Underground stations and are a good choice for short breaks. To charge or ‘top up’ your Oyster Card (known locally as an oyster), visit travel information centres, newsagents showing the blue Oyster symbol, and all London Underground stations. You can also use the Oyster Card app.\n\nContactless bank cards, Apple Pay and Android Pay can also be used on London’s transport system – there are daily caps meaning you can take unlimited journeys in a day for a set price, though these caps change depending on which zones you travel through.\n\nWhile it’s possible to drive around London, it can sometimes end up being the most time-consuming and expensive way to travel. London is congested, and cars are charged for entering certain central areas. This is known as the Congestion Charge, which is charged per day, and payable online. It applies to drivers who use the congestion zone Monday to Friday between 7am and 6pm, although black cabs are exempt. Certain vehicles will also have to pay to drive within the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), which is in force 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This zone covers a larger area of London than the Congestion Charge.\n\nGuidance for non-UK registered vehicles\n\nIf you intend to bring a vehicle from Europe and it is registered outside of the UK, you will need to register it with Transport for London before driving in the capital. More guidance can be found via the official Transport for London website.\n\nYou can also check if your vehicle meets emissions and safety standards. You can check your vehicle here.\n\nLondon Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)\n\nThe London ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) costs £12.50 per day (from midnight to midnight) for non-compliant vehicles. It was expanded to cover all London Boroughs in August 2023. It operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year, except Christmas Day (25 December).\n\nA failure to pay the ULEZ for a non-compliant vehicle could result in a penalty charge notice of £180. This can be reduced to £90 if paid within 14 days but can also be increased should you fail to pay or successfully challenge it. Both UK and non-UK registered vehicles can be given penalty charge notices.\n\nFind out more about the London ULEZ.\n\nThe Congestion Charge\n\nThe Congestion Charge covers central London and is a daily £15 charge. All vehicles driving in the zone are required to pay. It applies from 07:00 – 18:00 Monday to Friday, and 12:00 – 18:00 at weekends and bank holidays. There is no charge from Christmas Day to New Year’s Day bank holiday, inclusive.\n\nA failure to pay the Congestion Charge could result in a penalty charge notice of £180. This can be reduced to £90 if paid within 14 days but can also be increased should you fail to pay or successfully challenge it.\n\nFind out more about the Congestion Charge.\n\nLondon low emission zone (LEZ)\n\nThe low emission zone (LEZ) covers most of Greater London and operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year. The LEZ is not the same as the Congestion Charge zone in Central London and the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ).\n\nIf your vehicle is registered outside of the UK, you will need to register it with Transport for London to ensure that it meets the LEZ emission standards.\n\nFind out more about the low emission zone.\n\nDo driving charges apply to rental cars?\n\nThe Congestion Charge in London applies to all drivers. The requirement to pay the ULEZ fee will be dependent on whether your rental car meets emission standards. As most hire fleets are relatively new, the majority of vehicles will be exempt. Check with your car rental company when booking or picking up your vehicle to ensure it is compliant.\n\nWhat is a clean air zone (CAZ) or low emission zone (LEZ)?\n\nIn a bid to reduce air pollution, some cities in the UK have clean air zones (CAZ) or low emission zones (LEZ). Vehicles that do not meet emission standards may be charged for entering the zones. The minimum emission standard can be found in your vehicle logbook or checked via your vehicle manufacturer.\n\nEngland’s clean air zones\n\nSeven cities in England have clean air zones (CAZ) – Bath, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Portsmouth, Sheffield, and Newcastle/Gateshead. However, charges may only apply to non-compliant cars and motorcycles for the zones in Birmingham and Bristol.\n\nThe CAZ minimum standard for cars and vans is Euro 6 (for diesel vehicles) and Euro 4 (for petrol vehicles), motorcycles are Euro 3.\n\nThe zones operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year (midnight to midnight).\n\nFind out more about England’s clean air zones.\n\nScotland’s low emission zones\n\nUnlike England’s clean air zones, non-compliant vehicles cannot enter Scottish low emission zones at any time. There is no daily charge, just a £60 daily penalty.\n\nThe Scottish LEZ minimum standard for cars and vans is Euro 6 (for diesel vehicles) and Euro 4 (for petrol vehicles). The LEZ in Glasgow has been enforced from June 2023. Further zones in Dundee, Edinburgh and Aberdeen will be enforced from late May/early June 2024.\n\nFind out more about Scotland’s low emission zones."
