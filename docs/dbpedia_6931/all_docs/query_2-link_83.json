        "text": "Free if Discharge Date is LESS than 62 years ago:\n\nGenerally there is no charge for basic military personnel and medical record information provided to veterans, next of kin and authorized representatives from Federal (non-archival) records.\n\nSome companies advertise DD Form 214 research services and will charge a fee for obtaining copies. This is provided as a free service by the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nCosts for Discharge Dates MORE than 62 years ago:\n\nThere is a fee for records that are considered \"Archival,\" which depends on the discharge date. If the request is made 62 years after the service member's separation from the military, the records are now open to the public and subject to the public fee schedule (44 USC 2116c and 44 USC 2307). This is a rolling date, the current year minus 62 years. Learn more.\n\nThese archival requests require the purchase of the COMPLETE photocopy of the Official Military Personnel File (OMPF):\n\nA routine OMPFs of 5 pages or less: $25 flat fee\n\nA routine OMPF of 6 pages or more: $70 flat fee (most OMPFs fall in this category)\n\nPersons of Exceptional Prominence (PEP) OMPF: $.80 cents per page ($20 minimum)\n\nIf your request involves a service fee, you will be notified as soon as that determination is made.\n\nYou can mail or fax your signed and dated request to the National Archives' National Personnel Record Center (NPRC).
