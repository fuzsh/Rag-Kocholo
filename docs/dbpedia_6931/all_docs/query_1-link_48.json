If authorized by the President and Congress, our Agency would rapidly provide personnel to the Department of Defense while at the same time providing an Alternative Service Program for conscientious objectors.\n\nFederal Law requires nearly all male US citizens and male immigrants, 18 through 25, register with Selective Service.\n\nRegister\n\nVerify Registration\n\nRegistration for Men 18-25\n\nSelective Service registration is required by law as the first part of a fair and equitable system that, if authorized by the President and Congress, would rapidly provide personnel to the Department of Defense while at the same time providing for an Alternative Service Program for conscientious objectors. By registering, a young man remains eligible for jobs, state-based student aid in 31 states, Federally-funded job training, and U.S. citizenship for immigrant men."
