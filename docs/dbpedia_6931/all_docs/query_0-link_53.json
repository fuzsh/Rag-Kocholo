They can also be accessed by websites that use a map-based interface to connect to WMS, allowing data from different providers to be visualised spatially and compared.\n\nMany of these services contribute to the BGS complying with the EU INSPIRE directive.\n\nTo comply with cyber security accreditations required of UK government organisations, changes are being made to our OGC Web Map Services (WMS) at 17:00 on Tuesday 17th May 2022. As a result, some WMS clients may no longer be able to connect to our WMS services. For example, we are aware that this affects older versions of Esriâ€™s ArcMAP (version 10.5.1 and earlier). Where possible, please update to the latest version of the product to continue using our services. If you have any questions or are experiencing difficulties connecting to our WMS services using other clients then please contact us at enquiries@bgs.ac.uk.\n\nHow to view a WMS\n\nWMS must be viewed in compatible software. Tutorial videos showing how to include a WMS in an ArcGIS or MapInfo project are provided. To view WMS in other systems, please refer to their documentation.\n\nTerms of use"
