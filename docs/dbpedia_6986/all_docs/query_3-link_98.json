        "text": "Helen CLARKE\n\nPublic buildings in English Towns\n\nA preliminary survey\n\nRESUME\n\nArchaeological investigation of medieval towns has increased enormously over the past three decades. Early beginnings in towns such as Southampton (PLATTandcoLEMAN- smith, 1975), Winchester (biddle, 1976), Stamford (mahany et ai, 1982) and King's Lynn (clarke and carter, 1977) have led on to much more work elsewhere, so that virtually every major medieval town in Britain and many minor ones have now been subjected to at least some archaeological excavation and research (schofield and leech, eds, 1987). Interest has concentrated, however, on the topography, economy and, to some extent, demography of towns in the Middle Ages and scant attention has been paid to public buildings (even though, it can be argued, they must have had considerable influence on all three aspects).\n\nInterest in the administrative structure of towns, in which at least some public buildings played an important part, has mainly been the domain of documentary historians. Urban history written by documentary historians has a much longer tradition than that compiled from archaeological evidence and has been influential on the approaches pursued by archaeologists (for example, Reynolds, 1977). Nevertheless, because of the nature of the written sources which in England have only sporadic survival before the fourteenth century, historians have paid less attention to the early medieval period. They have largely concentrated on the administrative organization itself with little regard to the features of the buildings on which this organization was based. It is now up to the archaeologist to provide the physical remains of the buildings from which the administration of towns emanated.\n\n1. Approaches towards a definition\n\nBefore the archaeological study can advance, a definition of what is meant by a public building in the medieval, and specifically early medieval, period must be formulated. This is approached here by posing a series of questions:\n\n1 . Is a public building one erected by the town authorities to serve administrative purposes such as record keeping and the running of the urban bureaucracy? In this case it might be mentioned in written records as a Town Hall or a Guildhall (the term seems interchangeable in medieval records and can lead to confusion).\n\n2. Is it a building put up at the expense of one specific group of people, merchants for example, for its own use? This would most likely be referred to as a Guildhall, or simply a Hall,\n\nbelonging to a particular group or Guild, for example Cutlers'Hall in London.\n\n3. Is it a building to serve the legal requirements of both administration and people, a Court House?\n\n4. Is it a place of assembly for the townspeople, for example for a market, fair or for the collection of taxes?\n\n5. Might it be no building at all, but rather an open area of assembly defined by some sort of marker such as a cross?\n\n6. Might it be a civic church or chapel in which religious services for the municipality or secular assemblies were held?\n\n7. Might the term encompass building works undertaken by municipal authorities, such as walls, gatehouses and bridges, or faci-lities open to all such as public quays, weigh houses and the like?\n\n8. There are a number of other structures which might qualify as public buildings latrines, cook houses and so on. Should these be included in our definition?\n\nAlthough there is a danger that the definition may become too wide, all the above features are relevant to it. Thus, a public building should be regarded as a structure which either enabled the efficient running of the urban and economic administration, (town halls, guildhalls which will be concentrated on below - civic churches or chapels), served the infrastructure of towns (defences, bridges, gatehouses), acted as a place of common assembly (market halls, open spaces) or fulfilled a public function (latrines, cook houses).\n\nIn England, few such structures survive from before 1 300, although there are occasional survivals of town halls or guildhalls from a slightly earlier date, such as the crypt from c. 1270-90 beneath the present Guildhall in the City of London (barron, 1974) and the twelfth-century hall of St Mary's Guild in Lincoln (steane, 1985, 23). In contrast, many guildhalls from the later Middle Ages survive and still fulfill their civic functions today. The Guildhall in the City of London is one of these, but there are countless others in both major and minor towns throughout the country (for example, Trinity Guildhall in King 's Lynn, Norfolk; parker, 1971, 144-5). In addition there are many extant market halls from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and some stone town walls and gates from the thirteenth century and later (barley, 1974; kenyon, 1990, 1 83-99).\n\nThere are so few remains of public buildings from the period up to 1 300 that is tempting to suggest that the earlier medieval towns had no buildings which were specific to their civic"
