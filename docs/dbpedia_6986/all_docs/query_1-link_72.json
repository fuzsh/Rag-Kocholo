        "text": "LEWISTON — Piano and vocal artist Marc Mailhot will provide the entertainment at La Rencontre, Riverfront-Franco-Center’s quarterly luncheon, on Thursday, March 9.\n\nThe doors and bar will open at 10 a.m. and the meal will be served at 11:30 a.m.\n\nLa Rencontre (“the gathering”) includes a meal and entertainment, and is not restricted to French speakers or those of Franco descent.\n\n“All are welcome to attend,” said Denise Scammon, Riverfront-Franco Center marketing director. “No need to be a member of any social group or club.” She said the visual historical exhibits on display at the center that tell stories about the French Canadian immigrants who came to Lewiston to work in the mills can also be viewed at the event.\n\n“Language is a common thread between the immigrants of the mid-1800s and the immigrants of today,” she said. “In its early days, our La Rencontre events were attended by more than 300 people on a monthly basis,” Scammon said. “Many of those early supporters are no longer with us and we now host La Rencontre four times a year, with an attendance of around 80 people.”\n\nShe said the market for French programs has changed since the nonprofit was established in 2000. “Yet our mission work is more important than ever,” she said.\n\nOther French cultural programs are the free Parlez-Vous? French conversational meeting every other Thursday morning; tours of the former St. Mary’s Church, with stories and exhibits about the French Canadian immigrants who attended; miscellaneous French entertainment throughout the performance year; a French library with resources including oral histories; and a Franco Trail L-A map that highlights significant Franco American locations in Lewiston and Auburn.\n\nMailhot has been a performing artist for 63 years, beginning his musical career in September 1957 at age 6. He formally studying piano under Louis Sirois for 11 years. Mailhot played his first formal public performance in a piano recital in May 1960. He later took up drums, and also sings.\n\nPatrons of the Riverfront-Franco Center may recall that from 2015 to 2017, Mailhot was part of the Connie Combo in the Connie Francis Tribute Show.\n\nTickets for La Rencontre re $15 and must be bought by noon on the Monday before the event. They will not be sold at the door. Call or visit Riverfront-Franco Center box office, 46 Cedar St., 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 207-689-2000."
