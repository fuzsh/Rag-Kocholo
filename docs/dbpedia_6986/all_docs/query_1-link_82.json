        "text": "Since 1994, the Bamako Encounters (Rencontres de Bamako), co-organized and co-produced by Mali’s Ministry of Culture and l’Institut Français, have been held every two years in Bamako.\n\nInternational in scope, this cultural event focusing on issues in contemporary photography and video features exhibits, professional encounters, workshops, public projections and catalogue, which serve as a catalyst for the Continent’s artists, image professionals and the public at large.\n\nThe Bamako Encounters is aimed at promoting the various trends in contemporary photography and video in Africa by creating international exchange among artists, the public, curators, commissioners, the media and collectors.\n\nThe Bamako Encounters work with a highly diverse group of local and international partners (museums, galleries, foundations, art centres, public places, French cultural centres, art schools, photography training centres, cultural associations) to present a series of exhibits scattered throughout the city, thereby turning Bamako into a vast group exhibit, at once coherent and stimulating, centring on a guiding concept.\n\nSource: rencontres-bamako.com"
