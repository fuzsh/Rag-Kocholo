However, the existing health eco-system is highly fractured, and not yet ready to define, collect, and exchange data in a generally computable sense.

The html language tag in the narrative applies to the narrative. The language tag on the resource may be used to specify the language of other presentations generated from the data in the resource. Not all the content has to be in the base language. The Resource.language should not be assumed to apply to the narrative automatically.

Encounter.textDefinition\n\nA human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it \"clinically safe\" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.\n\nShortText summary of the resource, for human interpretationComments\n\nContained resources do not have narrative. Resources that are not contained SHOULD have a narrative. In some cases, a resource may only have text with little or no additional discrete data (as long as all minOccurs=1 elements are satisfied). This may be necessary for data from legacy systems where information is captured as a \"text blob\" or where text is additionally entered raw or narrated and encoded information is added later.\n\nControl0..1TypeNarrativeIs ModifierfalseSummaryfalseAlternate Namesnarrative, html, xhtml, displayInvariantsele-1: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) 30.

It SHOULD not be used for codes that correspond 1..1 with the Identifier.system. Some identifiers may fall into multiple categories due to common usage. Where the system is known, a type is unnecessary because the type is always part of the system definition. However systems often need to handle identifiers where the system is not known. There is not a 1:1 relationship between type and system, since many different systems have the same type.\n\nControl1..1BindingUnless not suitable, these codes SHALL be taken from FR Core ValueSet Encounter identifier type\n\n(extensible to https://hl7.fr/ig/fhir/core/ValueSet/fr-core-vs-encounter-identifier-type)TypeCodeableConceptIs ModifierfalseSummarytrueRequirements\n\nAllows users to make use of identifiers when the identifier system is not known.\n\nInvariantsele-1: All FHIR elements must have a @value or children (hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())) 48.
