        "text": "The 5th Meeting of the Historical Sites of the Grimaldis of Monaco will be held on Saturday 15 and Sunday 16 June, on Place du Palais Princier.\n\nOver the centuries, the Grimaldis have forged links and established themselves in many French and Italian regions. The princes of Monaco hold the titles of Duke of Valentinois, Marquis of Baux, Count of Carladès, Baron of Saint-Lô and of Hambye, Count of Longjumeau and others. These titles were acquired following diplomatic agreements and marriage alliances. Consequently, nearly 150 sites have links to the Grimaldi family.\n\nTo perpetuate the historical ties between former “fiefdoms” and the Principality, H.S.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco visits these sites on a regular basis. In 2018, at his behest, the First Meeting of the Historical Sites of the Grimaldis of Monaco was held on Place du Palais Princier with a dozen municipalities and regions with ties to his family.\n\nThis year, the Federation of the Historical Sites of the Grimaldis of Monaco has invited two French municipalities – Breil-sur-Roya and Bathernay – and 10 Italian municipalities: Ventimiglia, Olivetta San Michele, Airole, Ripacandida, Campagna, Monteverde, Spinazzola, Poggiorsini, Terlizzi and Canosa di Puglia.\n\nThe event will be held in an atmosphere of friendship and sharing. There will be a wide range of activities for young and old alike: cultural events, culinary specialities, folk dances, a chance to discover artists and traditional trades, pony rides, square bocce matches, farm animals and more.\n\nEach site invited to the event will highlight its historic links to the Principality and its region as well as its cultural heritage.\n\nA highlight of the weekend will be the sound and light show, scheduled on Saturday 15 June at 10pm. A projection onto the Prince’s Place will tell the story of the links between the invited sites and the Grimaldi Dynasty.\n\nEntrance to the event is free.\n\nMore information and the full programme of events are available at:"
