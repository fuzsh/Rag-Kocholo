        "text": "PARIS. The Musées des Arts Décoratifs (MAD) tries to bridge the gaps between childhood and adulthood in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s world famous book for children.\n\nAs a nonnative French speaker, having only lived in France for the past three years, I will never fully understand the impact that Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s Le Petit Prince has on French culture. That withstanding, I have indeed read it, and it actually was the first book I was required to read in its integrity in my French classes growing up, so in a way, it does hold a rather special place in my heart. However, even if an equivalent of the book in terms of its culture existed in the United States (my home country), I am unsure that such a work would ever be celebrated in quite this way. Literary exhibitions are not a part of common culture in the USA — the reasons are plural no doubt, and one of them is absolutely the lack of attention to national works of art, specifically treasuring our native tongue.\n\nNevertheless, the exhibition ‘À la rencontre du petit prince’ works to level the playing field, by truly digging its claws into what makes this book so utterly irreplaceable to its readers. This beautiful literary expo displays what can only be described as a network of cultural artifacts that are interwoven with Saint-Exupéry’s magnum opus.\n\nA story of beginnings. As one would expect, the exhibition has many different quotations and excerpts from Le Petit Prince. The first one is written in a clean, black typeface on a mustard yellow wall, introducing the exhibit: “Je suis de mon enfance,” which is translated in English to “I come from my childhood,” written just below*. This introduction positions the exhibition, anchoring it with the book at a period of time in which our lives begin, abiding by a linear chronology. In the same room, some of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s earliest drawings are superimposed on an adjacent wall, with a display case in the center of the room, containing literary works that inspired de Saint-Exupéry when creating the world of Le Petit Prince.\n\nIn how the beginning of the story is immediately linked to the background of its author and illustrator, the exhibition sets the stage for the rest of the tour, which is that the exhibit is more than just a meditation on its literary content: it is also a meditation on the life of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. This makes a bold statement in notion that you can’t separate art from the artist, which is typically used in other types of discourse, but ultimately is true for all types of artistic creation.\n\nA story about airplanes. The largest room without question is dedicated to Saint Exupéry’s fascination with aviation and airplanes, which is omnipresent in Le Petit Prince, especially with the character of the Pilot. This undoubtedly is the direct result of Saint-Exupéry’s own experience as a commercial pilot before World World II. On display in this navy blue room are excerpts from the book about the Pilot, drawings of the airplane and the Pilot, airline advertisements that from the 20th century that were made following the release of Le Petit Prince, and even a short film about flight.\n\nMotifs. The exhibition is painted with recurring symbols from the book that are both tasteful and highlight the importance of the book. Such the glowing silhouettes of the airplane from the book, as well as the outline of the little prince himself. This makes sense, as the exhibit is a balanced display of storytelling and its inspirations, echoed in the little prince and the airplane, respectively amongst many other elements.\n\nWatercolours and saved letters. Much of the remainder of the exhibit is dedicated to sketches and watercolor drafts — which are ubiquitous in the exhibit but are displayed more abundant in a single, gallery-like setting — as well as letters and drafts that were saved and now released to the museum by Sylvia Hamilton, a close friend of de Saint-Exupéry’s during his time spent in New York. The watercolors that were kept in the care of Hamilton are displayed in throughout the room with a walk-through path, and one is brought to think about the kind of relationship between with whom someone to leave the originals of one’s magnum opus. Visitors can approach the watercolors so closely, in an intimate way, so as to nearly touch them, despite being behind glass. For me, it was very interesting to see how Saint-Exupéry’s visions of the characters changed over time throughout his draft paintings, and which ones he deemed most appropriate to be used in the book. However, one thing is very apparent: while the book is composed of a limited number of works of art, it does not exist in a vacuum. Saint-Exupéry’s imaginative world is a continuous one, exhibited prominently in these rooms.\n\nA shared culture. The concluding room of this awe-inspiring visit is a room full of different editions of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s Le Petit Prince, published in different languages from all over the world. They are housed in a glass case bookshelf along one wall, with all of their covers fully exposed to show the diversity of the collection. Hawaiian, Russian, Latin, Arabic, and more — there seem to be hundreds of copies. The limitation to this aspect of the exhibit is in the inaccessibility of these books — they are not available for tactile interactions from visitors. From a practical aspect, I understand that it would perhaps pose a steep task to monitor each of the books. The reality of the situation is, however, that these books are not limited editions, and would be put to much better use if children and adults alike were able to flip through and engage. Therefore, the interactions would be more intimate — to see the words on the page and how they are connected with the images that the visitors already know so well. In that way, the international scale would be more transparent rather than just seeing the ensemble of books in different languages.\n\nThis final chapter, in a way, reverts back to when I spoke of the book’s influence in its home country. The expansiveness of the book’s influence exceeds that of France, and it was only during this exhibit when I learned that Le Petit Prince was first published in the United States of America in 1943, only for it to be published in its home country of France two years later when the war finished. The multiplicity of languages in which Saint-Exupéry’s words are translated is beautifully represented in this closing piece.\n\nBridging gaps. Through all of the different rooms, and the journey from beginning to end, one is made to think about the audience over and over. Who is this exhibit for? Who is the book for? While the aesthetic and scale of the story may lead one to automatically deduce that it is a children’s story, I believe the exhibit highlights that the book is intended for those of all ages, and that in the end, there is potentially a more profound engagement for adults, specifically parents, who are brought to think about their child, their child’s relationship to reading, and their own childhood. How have their views of childhood changed since they first read the book at perhaps a very young age? Is their inner child still available to come out and interact with art and culture? In its simplicity and openness, this gorgeous exhibit lends itself to all sorts of reflections such as those aforementioned, and posits that maybe our child’s gaze never truly disappears: it reappears in our moments of nostalgia.\n\n*To note — the entire exhibition is accessible in both French and English, including all of the quotations and captions. The exception to this is the collection of handwritten letters addressed by de Saint-Exupéry to a number of different people, which were not translated to English for the purpose of the exhibition.\n\nAriel Klinghoffer\n\nMaster M2CL 2021-2022\n\nUniversité Paris 8"
