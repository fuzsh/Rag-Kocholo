        "text": "Join a Discussion on Movies\n\nBy STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\na Rencontre\" is an unfortunate example of the visual limitations of movies made with small video cameras. Its beautifully composed shots of everyday objects that have acquired a luminous significance in the mind of a filmmaker, because of their association with a woman he loves, look terrible in video.\n\nThe colors are washed out, and the resolution is fuzzy.\n\nAs the movie displays its catalogue of personal effects, you\n\nfeel cheated, then numbed.\n\nA diary of a filmmaker's passionate love affair, \"La Rencontre,\" made by the well-regarded French director Alain Cavalier, never shows the lovers' faces except for a shadowy reflection of the diarist holding a video camera. Instead of getting to know the couple by studying their faces and body language, the movie wants to draw us into their world by listening to their voices and contemplating images intended to evoke their intimate histories.\n\nIt doesn't work. Shoes, pebbles, eyeglasses, keys, melons, caf√© au lait, wristwatches, a pet bird, feet being massaged with oil, a Water Pik: the film methodically moves from the couple's indoor existence to bring in more and more of the outside world. It becomes unintentionally funny when the camera lingers over a large bug crawling over the woman's flesh and the man rhapsodizes about the creature's sensing it has found a very desirable niche. When the man complains about his father's contempt for the fact that he is not doing useful work, you sympathize with the father.\n\nIf \"La Rencontre,\" which opens today at Anthology Film Archives, looked better, it might have had a completely different effect. But what's the point of contemplating the inherent beauty of objects if they are photographed in a medium that makes them prosaic?"
