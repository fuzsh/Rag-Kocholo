        "text": "Created in 2016 by Diane Marissal and Jérémie Leblanc, Les Canailles is a duo where the literary and artistic influences of one blend with the visual and graphic culture of the other.\n\nTheir meeting marked the beginning of a collaboration on the border between fine art and graphic design: art books, art direction, exhibitions, collages and serigraphs.\n\nThey began working four-handed to bring their first images to life: colorful, abstract compositions that treat plane and color as the main narrative elements, characterized by saturation of color and space.\n\nWhether illustration, silkscreen or publishing, collage is at the heart of their four-handed practice.\n\nFast shipping in 24h/48h\n\nVia Colissimo or courier to Paris RP, while stocks last.\n\nPreparation\n\nOur books, artists’ illustrations and everything else we ship is lovingly packaged. Cardboard, tubes, tissue paper, bubble wrap and gift wrapping… we do everything possible to ensure that your order arrives at your door in tip-top condition!\n\nIn-store collection 7 days a week\n\nWe’re open 7 days a week, 363 days a year, except on 25 December and 1 January. So drop in whenever you like!\n\nTO ERR IS HUMAN…\n\nYou have 30 days to exchange an item that doesn’t fit. Artazart will not ask you any questions because…to err is human!\n\nQUALITY\n\nArtazart works with the best printers and printers in Paris for both photography and illustration. Whether it’s a silver print made in Paris and Fine Art on neutral ph paper and pigment inks guaranteed for 200 years, or a digital print on Fedrigoni paper, we take great care in printing your works of art.\n\nCERTIFIED WORKS\n\nYour artwork is unique, signed and very often numbered because it is produced in a small number of copies. For very small series, a certificate of authenticity accompanies your illustration or photograph.\n\nNEED A FRAME?\n\nJust call us on working days on 01 40 40 24 03."
