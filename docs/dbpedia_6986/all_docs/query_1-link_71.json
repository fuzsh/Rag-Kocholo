        "text": "In France this summer, arts programming offers a plentiful encounter with artists, designers, and photographers alerted to the issues of global warming and our relationship to the living world, including a proliferation of scientific collaborations, and on-site experiences. A truly multi-disciplinary approach can be seen to be developing in exhibition production, with a greater consideration of the environment placed at the heart of historic events such as the Rencontres d’Arles.\n\nMany exhibitions, festivals, and triennials taking place in France this summer aim to foster a greater sensitivity to our co-existence with the vegetal world and invite us to ask profound questions about our impact on the planet.\n\nGROWING RELATIONSHIPS WITH NON-HUMANS, SOILS AND LANDSCAPES\n\nNew terms have made their way into the field of art to describe our relationships with the rest of the living world. Férale, the title of Charlotte Cosson’s latest book, is also the name of a new group exhibition at FRAC Alsace, curated by François Génot. Her selection of artists, including Suzanne Husky, Daniel Steegmann Mangrané, and Lois Weinberger, are all using their work to explore ways of being in contact with living ecosystems found in fragile environments.\n\nThe history of plant use is also the starting point for Nicolas Pirus‘s residency. His exhibition at Le Creux de l’enfer, open since June 26th, presents the results of his research. For her residency at Laboratoires d’Aubervilliers, Paula Valero turns her attention to Rosa Luxembourg’s herbarium. Since July 2nd, Ivana Adaime Makac has been creating a new landscape at Ravitaillement, a place for art and rural practices in Gavray-sur-Sienne, Manche, composed of plants that appear to be under a spell. Charlotte Gautier Van Tour continues her research on ecosystems for her residency at the Maison Forte de Hautetour, Saint-Gervais. Opening on July 14th, the exhibition “Bloom” presents the fruit of her experiments, encouraging us to discover the aquatic history of the Alps. Other group exhibitions offer us a moment of contemplation and reflection: Paysage. Fenêtre sur la nature at Louvre Lens, on view until July 24th; Enchanter la terre at Château du Rivau, on view until November 12nd; and “À la rencontre du vivant” at the Goodplanet Foundation, featuring Fabrice Hyber and Vincent Laval1, on view until December 17th. Finally, at the Domaine de Certes, the group exhibition “Chemins de cimes”, proposed by the Forest Art Project association, features 16 artists that encourage visitors to wonder at and whet their curiosity about the mysteries of nature and forests.\n\nTERRITORIAL EXPERIENCES\n\nThe “Triennale Art & Industrie” in Dunkirk, an original collective and territorial initiative, continues its reflection on the energy and ecological challenges facing Hauts-de-France, a region whose history is intrinsically linked to industrial development. Entitled “Chaleur Humaine” (Human Warmth), this second edition features a wide-ranging program of over 250 works distributed between the FRAC Grand Large, the LAAC, and the public space, alternating historic works (Agnes Denes, Joseph Beuys, Gina Pane, etc.) with recent creations (Michel Blazy, Suzanne Husky¹, Otobong Nkanga², etc). It is also the occasion to visit places usually closed to the public, such as Jean-François Kreb’s intervention in a large, ghostly abandoned wine cellar.\n\nAt FRAC Grand Large, Hans Haacke and José Gamarra bear witness to the depletion of fossil and forest resources and their consequences on living organisms, whilst, conversely, Alexandre Hogue‘s paintings at LAAC celebrate a utopia of peaceful cohabitation between landscape and human intervention.\n\nCurated by Fabrice Bousteau, Les Extatiques is an open-air exhibition on the theme of the four elements. Works by artists Jérémy Gobé³, Bob Verschueren, and Cornelia Konrads offer a fresh look at architecture, and in particular the constituent elements of the two sites where they are exhibited, Paris La Défense and La Seine Musicale.\n\nFinally, our exhibition itinerary pierces the forest of the Meuse region, where this summer new works by the artist Marjolijn Dijkman will be inaugurated as part of the project Vent des forêts, which has been forging links between artists, local people, and the forest since 1997.\n\nSOLO SHOWS BY RENOWNED, AND MUST-SEE ARTISTS\n\nFollowing his three-month residency at the Château de Chambord, Lionel Sabatté⁴ is presenting 150 works in the château, as well as its park and formal garden, some of them made from the château’s own dust. The artist also has a solo show at the Monastère Royal de Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse. Since May 27th, Anne-Charlotte Finel‘s⁵ videos at the fortress of Salses, Pyrénées-Orientales, have rendered its bats and other little-considered animals visible. Galerie Les Filles du Calvaire devotes its summer to the pioneering Art Orienté Objet duo, with a retrospective exhibition entitled “Je suis contre!” highlighting the artists’ wide-spanning research into recycling, ethnology, and biology. Finally, Eva Jospin4 takes over the rooms of the Palais des Papes in Avignon. Her monumental cardboard installations transport us into mysterious forests while responding to the history and Gothic architecture of the building (Palazzo exhibition on view until January 7th, 2024).\n\nBIO-INNOVATION AMONG DESIGNERS\n\nAt Toulon’s Hôtel des Arts and as part of the Design Parade, “SECOND NATURE” brings together a selection of designers exploring the different pathways of sustainable design, until November 5th. The exhibition features remarkable examples of biofabrication from numerous French national collections (CNAP, Mobilier national, Musée des Arts Décoratifs, and Centre Pompidou), including Marlène Huissoud‘s fascinating Cocoon cabinet, made from thousands of silkworm cocoons covered in propolis (bee resin), and a chair from Samuel Tomatis‘ Alga series, made from an innovative material based on invasive seaweed from the Brittany coast.\n\nTHE 54TH RENCONTRES D’ARLES: “STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS” CAPTURED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS\n\nThe year 2023 marks an important turning point for Les Rencontres d’Arles. While the Arles festival’s eco-design approach is not new (the walls were already being reused in the 2000s), this year’s edition, from July 3rd to September 24th, stands out for its collective reflection on the subject alongside ecologists, historians, and urban planners from Lyon’s Cité Anthropocène, and the festival’s involvement in the group ‘Collectif des Festivals Éco-responsables et Solidaires’. This year’s program is also particularly influenced by ecological concerns. The “GROW UP” exhibition program at the Manuel Rivera-Ortiz Foundation, for example, offers a cross-section of perspectives on the relationship between plants and people around the world. The exhibition Luces Distantes presents Marc Lathuillière‘s “environmental portraits”, highlighting the resistance of the Afro-descendant community of Madre Unión in Colombia against deforestation and threats from agro-industrialists and narco-paramilitaries. Chuan Lun Wu5 presents JTC, a series of photographs of plants placed in pots made from recycled industrial containers, a habit adopted by the inhabitants of Taiwan, which resonates with the highly industrialized landscape of the region. In the exhibition “Ici près”, Mathieu Asselin, Tanja Engelberts and Sheng-Wen Lo reveal how the ecosystems of Arles and its surrounding area are being impacted by human activities, and question our responsibility. Peruvian photographer Roberto Huarcaya invites the vegetation of the Amazon rainforest to write their own stories and testify to their own vulnerability, using carefully-placed light-sensitive paper. Also of note is the Fondation Thalie’s Hors les Murs event in Arles, “Persephone”, featuring photographs by Leslie Moquin that document the clothing sculptures created by Jeanne Vicerial as part of her residency at the Académie de France in Rome – Villa Médicis.\n\nThis unique Tour de France, from the treetops of the plant world to the overspilling of pollution, allows us to rethink and feel differently about our relationship with the planet and other living things. These artists and researchers lead a life more deeply rooted in the earth, closer to and more respectful of living beings, a philosophy of being in the world that we can all draw inspiration from in the future.\n\nPauline Lisowski and Aloïs Loizeau\n\nTranslation (from French): Oscar Bardet and Stefano Vendramin\n\nJuly 2023\n\nCover: Lionel Sabatté, “Pollens clandestins”, Château de Chambord © Château de Chambord\n\nImpact Art News, June-July 2023 #44\n\nSubscribe to Impact Art News: here\n\n¹ In conversation with Suzanne Husky, Impact Art News #16\n\n² In conversation with Otobong Nkanga, Impact #18³ En conversation avec Jérémy Gobé, Impact Art News #19\n\n⁴ In conversation with Lionel Sabatté, Impact Art News #11\n\n⁵ Lauréat.e du Prix Planète Art Solidaire d’Art of Change 21\n\n⁶ Art of Change 21’s Eco-Design Prize laureate⁷ In conversation with Chuan Lun Wu, Impact Art News #41\n\nEXHIBITIONS\n\nLara Almarcegui, Guillaume Barth, Nicolas Daubanes, Denicolai & Provoost, François Génot, Guillaume Greff, Katrin Gattinger & Anna Guilló, Claudie Hunzinger, Suzanne Husky, Myriam Mihindou, Sandra Knecht, Jochen Lempert,Feral Practice, Daniel Steegmann Mangrané, Steiner & Lenzlinger, Bruno Serralongue, Lois Weinberger\n\nSUR LES BORDS DU MONDE Férales, fières & farouches | 01.07.23 – 19.11.23FRAC Alsace (Sélestat, Grand Est)\n\nNicolas Pirus\n\nMémoires de plantes | 24.06.23 – 17.09.2023\n\nLe Creux de l’Enfer (Thiers, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes)\n\nIvana Adaime Makac\n\nPrimeurs, Zombies, Nagori | 02.07.23 – 19.08.23\n\nLe Ravitaillement (Gavray-sur-Seine, Normandie)\n\nCharlotte Gautier van Tour\n\nBLOOM | 14.07.2023 – 17.09.2023\n\nMaison Forte de Hautetour (Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes)\n\nPaula Valero, Pascale Obolo\n\nHerbier Résistant Rosa Luxemburg | 01.04.23 – 31.10.23Les Laboratoires d’Aubervilliers (Aubervilliers, Île-de-France)\n\nCatherine Empis\n\nPaysage.
