        "text": "The \"Alchimie de la rencontre\" exhibition offers a new presentation of works from the Yvon Lambert donation. Each room will have its own identity, creating new dialogues between works from the Lambert Collection and objects from other museums in Avignon and friendly collections. The works will also be linked to poetry, literature and art history.\n\nConceived as a journey through the collection, the exhibition will be rich in references to exhibitions in Yvon Lambert's gallery, as well as those in the Collection Lambert (\"À Fripon Fripon et Demi\", \"La Disparition des Lucioles\" and \"Figures de l'acteur\").\n\nIn 1969, Yvon Lambert made art history in France by organising the first exhibition of the English artist Richard Long in his gallery. Fifty years on, only a photograph remains of the original installation by Richard Long. In collaboration with the artist himself and the dealer-collector, this emblematic installation will be recreated in all its original splendour.â¨â¨â¨ At the same time, some sixty works from the 1960s and 1970s will be activated by the protocol devised by John Cage in 1993: \"Rolywholyover A Circus\". â¨The works will be permanently reinstalled in public, following the precise instructions of software designed specifically for the exhibition.â¨ â¨The exhibition will feature a number of new interventions, including one by artist Adrien Vescovi, who will hang works that resonate with John Cage's protocol, and one by architect and scenographer Olivier Vadrot, who will create a device to encourage discussion and debate, installed in the museum's rooms."
