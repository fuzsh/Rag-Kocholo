        "text": "I’m a thousand different people–Every one is real\n\n2024-03-15 – 2025-01-05 · New York, United States of America\n\nTaking its title from a drawing by artist and queer icon Candy Darling, this exhibition brings together a selection of works recently acquired by the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art. Darling’s words evoke the multidimensionality of queer and trans life and artistic practices that insist on defining art and life entirely on one’s own terms. Taken together, the exhibited works–across various media and representational styles–embrace a spectral, prismatic approach to rendering LGBTQIA+ existence. Both contemporary and historical, the works elide the demand for authenticity and easy legibility, instead holding space for plurality, reinvention, and fantasy.\n\nMore Info\n\nChristiane Eisler: Punk in der DDR\n\n2024-05-30 – 2024-08-31 · Leipzig, Germany\n\nThe gallery Analog Art Photography presents Christiane Eisler – Punk in der DDR.

The Analog Art Photography gallery is now showing a new edition of hand-enlarged black-and-white images from Christiane Eisler’s extensive negative archive. The gallery Analog Art Photography is a satellite of the f-stop photo festival in Leipzig from May 31 to June 16, 2024.\n\nMore Info\n\nVivan Maier – Unseen\n\n2024-05-30 – 2024-08-31 · New York, United States of America\n\nUnseen focuses on the whole of Vivian Maier’s work, from the early 1950s to the mid-1980s, through around 200 works, vintage or modern prints, color, black and white, super 8 films and soundtracks, offering a complete vision of the dense, rich and complex architecture of this archive that provides a fascinating testimony to post-war America and the hell of the American dream.\n\nMore Info\n\nHolga Invasion: Diana’s Counter-Attack\n\n2024-07-01 – 2024-11-30\n\nWith the release of Ugly Beautiful Vol. 1 and the promise that Vol. 2 will be released in a much more timely manner, it’s time to consider a second season of Ugly Beautiful.

The motto of the festival this year is “GARDEN”. Gardens are not just physical places; they reflect identities, dreams, and visions. They are deeply rooted in culture and demonstrate our connection to nature. In times of climate crisis, threatened biodiversity, and social injustice, Frameout 2024 transforms the GARDEN into a venue for change and familiar garden metaphors are reinterpreted through cinematic perspectives. In short film programs, we encounter talking plants, a giant asparagus, and secret gardens expressing fantasies and desires.\n\nMore Info\n\nBar Stories on Camera\n\n2024-07-25 – 2024-10-06 · Torino, Italy\n\nFrom 25 July to 6 October 2024, CAMERA will host in the Project Room the third stage of the exhibition Bar Stories on Camera, realized in collaboration with Galleria Campari and Magnum Photos: a tale through images, from the 1930s to the beginning of the 2000s, of the world of the bar and of that culture of conviviality for which Campari has been a spokesman since 1860.\n\nMore Info\n\nFotografia Calabria Festival 2024\n\n2024-07-26 – 2024-08-25 · San Lucido, Italy\n\nFrom July 26th to August 25th, the town of San Lucido (CS) will host exhibitions, events, talks and workshops dedicated to photography.\n\nMore Info\n\nPurple Echoes of Nice: a Photo Exhibition by David Elalouf\n\n2024-08-08 – 2024-10-02 · Nice, France\n\nUntil October 2nd, 2024, David Elalouf (dudizm) will exhibit 10 large-format photographs featuring LomoChrome Purple shots of the Promenade des Anglais at the Promenade du Paillon.\n\nMore Info\n\nUnfolding Futures\n\n2024-08-31 · Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nThis event is part of UNFOLDING FUTURES, the inaugural edition of our summer residency program in collaboration with the Royal Academy of Arts, The Hague.
