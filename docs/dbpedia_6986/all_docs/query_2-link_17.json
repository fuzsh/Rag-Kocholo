        "text": "In 1921, Gabrielle Chanel was 38 years old, and dazzlingly successful. Nicknamed the ‘Queen of Paris’ by certain journalists, she had managed to establish a new silhouette that instantly gave her international influence. Her Parisian salon in Faubourg Saint-Honoré was a pivotal place, where all the artistic avant-garde of the day rubbed shoulders. This year she met Ernest Beaux, perfumer to the Tsars, following this rencontre, ‘N°5’ was created: a mirror image of mademoiselle in fragrance form, the most famous scent in the world. Step into the famous perfumer’s shoes. Slip behind the curtain and travel back in time in this intimate immersive, multi-sensory experience.\n\nParis during the avant garde period was a vivid cradle for artists and bold colourful characters. Think Pierre Reverdy arguing vigorously with jean Cocteau, Picasso causing scandals at the Théâtre du Châtelet with his stage curtains for Serge Diaghilev and Erik Satie modern ballet. It was a time and place like no others for creators and rules breakers. When I discovered how much of those innovations took shape right inside mademoiselle Parisian salon in Faubourg Saint-Honoré I became obsessed with the idea to use VR and immersive theatre staging to plunge viewers inside this vibrant period. While making my research I then discovered how much of this spirit could be abstracted in one bold creation move, the invention of a new revolutionary sent."
