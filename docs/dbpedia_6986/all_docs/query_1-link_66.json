This first pavilion explores the many peoples who, over thousands of years, have inhabited the region and met through their journeys.\n\nThe Cartier-Roberval Archaeological Site, Where Two Worlds Meet\n\nThe Inhabiting pavilion also contains the Cartier-Roberval archaeological site, where two worlds meet, presented by the Commission de la capitale nationale du Qu√©bec.\n\nThis part of the exhibition relates the first French colonization attempt on the Cap-Rouge promontory in 1541.\n\nAn immersive experience and artefacts found on the archaeological site allow the public to travel to a fascinating era and highlight the first encounters between Europeans and Indigenous peoples on the territory that is now known as Qu√©bec.\n\nThe aid history reflects the evolution of values and social changes in Qu√©bec.\n\nThe Sharing Pavilion displays a crucial space for mutual help and solidarity in Qu√©bec: a home. A safe space for personal, family and collective life where the different rooms create an ideal space for gatherings and mutual help between family members . . . in the broad sense of the word!\n\nA yellow birch, Qu√©bec‚Äôs emblematic tree and ultimate symbol of sharing, is also a main element of the pavilion.\n\nUpon entering the pavilion, the public is immediately swarmed with archive images of protests, giving them the impression of being there.\n\nIndigenous protests, colonial protests, the women‚Äôs right to vote, the right to strike, we meet in solidarity to create a societal change.\n\nTo make it happen, we use peaceful actions such as marches or visual arts, but sometimes vandalism, civil disobedience and even weapons are involved.\n\nMany people born here identify as Quebecers or Canadians, some even identify as both, and others first identify themselves as members of the First Nations or citizens of the world!\n\nIdentity is built around many factors, including gender, family, culture and neighbourhood of residence, and is defined by a specific period and context. This last pavilion is based on this notion."
