        "text": "Irish artist Micheal Farrell attended Central St. Martin's College of Art, London. Farrell’s abstracted pop art style paintings became popular in the late 1960s and he represented Ireland at the Paris Biennale in 1967. Though based in France from 1971, Farrell’s conflictual feelings about Ireland and the escalating violence in the North profoundly influenced his work. A member of Aosdána, he exhibited regularly at the Taylor Galleries and is represented in many private and public collections.\n\nView Artist"
