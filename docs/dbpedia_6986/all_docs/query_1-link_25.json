        "text": "«Esthétique de la rencontre» is a collective exhibition that is presently on view at La Fondation Clément in Martinique. The exhibition, which opened on November 30, 2012, will continue until January 6, 2013.\n\nThis exhibition, curated by Dominique Berthet, includes works by Victor Anicet, Christian Bertin, Julie Bessard, Hervé Beuze, Ernest Breleur, Alexandre Cadet-Petit, Chantal Charron, Patricia Donatien, Serge Goudin-Thébia, Norville Guirouard-Aizée, Serge Hélénon, Thierry Jarrin, Valerie John, Joseph Sainte-Croix René-Corail dit Khokho, Louis Laouchez, René Louise, Robert Manscour, Monique Monteil, Bertin Nivor, Bruno Pédurand, and Luz Severino.\n\nDescription: Belonging to different generations, using diverse mediums, and upholding artistic ideas that are often different from one another, what do these artists have in common? They have played a key role in the construction of a history of art in Martinique and in reflecting on the development of a new and specific art. Today, they are developing a work that speaks of a place and a history, while opening up to the rest of the world. This aesthetics of coming together to which they belong, is also an imaginary gathering. Beyond their diversity, they come together around a number of questions or ideas—notions of memory, heritage, traces, identity, ownership, or fragments—to which they ascribe forms and approaches that are always singular."
