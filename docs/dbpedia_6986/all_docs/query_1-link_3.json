        "text": "About\n\nLes Rencontres de la Photographie in Marrakech will take place from October 23 to 27, 2024. During these encounters, artists will be invited to participate in the festival through the exhibition of their work, screenings, workshops, conferences, portfolio reviews, and numerous moments of exchange, particularly with experts. The OFF of the Rencontres d'Arles brings together dozens of exhibitions on the sidelines of the Rencontres d'Arles, in around a hundred locations in Arles, from July to September.\n\nWhat winners receive\n\n20 Winners:\n\nEach winner will receive a screening exhibition of their project during the 4th edition of Les Rencontres de la Photographie in Marrakech, as well as a printed exhibition at Les OFF des Rencontres d'Arles 2024. For the screening in Marrakech, each photographer can either create their own video or use a videographer provided by the festival. The printed exhibition at the OFF in Arles, titled \"The Language of Pictures,\" will be held at CIQ de la Roquette in Place Paul Doumer, Arles, from July 1 to 7, 2024. It will feature two photographs from each winning project, selected by one of our jurors. This innovative exhibition allows the public to arrange the images, creating a unique and ever-changing display with each interaction.\n\n30 Finalists:\n\nEach finalist will have two photos from their project, selected by one of our jurors, screened during the 4th edition of Les Rencontres de la Photographie in Marrakech. A single video, created by one of the Festival's videographers, will showcase all the finalists' work together.\n\nAbout Les Rencontres de la Photographie Marrakech\n\nThe call is organized by two non-profit, non-governmental associations: Voix Plurielles and Cultures Nomades Production. Voix Plurielles, based in Casablanca, Morocco, organizes Les Rencontres de la Photographie in Marrakech. Cultures Nomades Production, based in Arles, France, co-produces the Marrakech festival and is a partner of the OFF of the Rencontres d'Arles."
