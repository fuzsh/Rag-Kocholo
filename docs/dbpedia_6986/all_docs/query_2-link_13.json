        "text": "The Franco Center is located in the former St. Mary’s Church by the canals and the landmark Simard-Payne (Railroad) Park in the area of downtown Lewiston known as Riverfront Island, in the heart of the “Little Canada” neighborhood. Our distinctive spire is one of the tallest sights you see as you drive in to town.\n\nWhile no longer used as a place of worship, the reverence we have for our home and its original use is evident, from the preserved stained glass and original architectural elements, down to the way we approach our work here.\n\nThis beautiful Gothic-style building is a state-of-the-art 428-seat performing arts center, a museum, and a multi-purpose function hall. Both levels are used for concerts, dances, workshops, weddings, speakers, banquets, educational programs, and much more. It has become one of Lewiston-Auburn’s greatest community assets."
