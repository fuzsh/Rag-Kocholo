        "text": "A writer, aviator, poet, explorer and philosopher, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s humanist ideals and altruism shaped his rich life. The last book published during his lifetime; The Little Prince represents the pinnacle of his literary achievements. First published in the United States in 1943, then in France in 1946, this tale has since become a timeless classic. As the bearer of a universal message, The Little Prince crosses borders and time. The Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris presents the first major museum exhibition in France devoted to this classic.\n\nNot to be missed.\n\nExhibited are old Aéropostale calendars dating from 1930, for example, and Bernard Lamotte’s famous table. A wooden table on which the writer-traveller carved a silhouette, foreshadowing that of his Little Prince. This precious and unique piece of furniture, owned by Air France, bears witness to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s stay in New York between 1941 and 1943, and to his close friendship with the artist Lamotte.\n\nThe Designers Unit agency was entrusted with the layout of the exhibition. The exhibition is centered around seven themes, tracing Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s childhood and career, as well as the long gestation of The Little Prince. For example, we learn more about the key role of the plane in how the story came about. Saint-Exupéry was involved in an accident in 1935. While attempting to beat the speed record for the Paris-Saigon raid in his red Caudron, the explorer broke down in the Sahara desert. He narrowly escaped death. It was a life-changing experience for the man who, a few years later, would be inspired by his accident when writing The Little Prince.\n\n… for a literary masterpiece\n\nThe Little Prince is not only an essential part of Saint-Exupéry’s life, but also a worldwide bestseller. The figures demonstrating its success are staggering – some 14 million books purchased worldwide since its publication in 1946, over 400,000 copies purchased each year in France, not forgetting 400 translations into both international languages and dialects.\n\nThis masterpiece of French literature and a classic devoured by children, the book is now at the heart of a monumental retrospective. With over 600 exhibits including watercolours, sketches, photographs, poems, newspaper cuttings, extracts from letters, etc., the exhibition retraces the life of the aviator and explorer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Most have never been seen by the public before.\n\nThe Little Prince on board Air France\n\nAs an ambassador of French culture around the world, Air France has joined forces with the Musée des Arts Décoratifs as a lender of works from its collection. These will complement the exhibition « À la rencontre du petit prince » . In addition, the company operated a very special flight on 1 February. Code name – AF007. The crew transported several sheets of the original manuscript from the Morgan Library & Museum in New York to Paris. This was a first, as this original script had never before left the United States. But the manuscript finally crossed the Atlantic!"
