        "text": "Diverse cultures, performing arts, and languages come together at the Franco Center during La Rencontre (the gathering). Traditionally, in Franco culture, big celebratory meals included live music provided by members of the family and their neighbors. Many families made sure their kids each learned to play an instrument to entertain at such gatherings â€” and so, accordingly, the Franco Center invites local musicians to provide live music for its guests.\n\nLa Rencontre is usually held the second Thursday of September, December, and March, and the closest Thursday in June to St-Jean-Baptiste Day which is June 24.Most La Rencontre events are luncheons with the doors opening at 10:30 a.m. followed by lunch at 11:30 a.m. followed by some form of entertainment.\n\nTickets are $17 per person and include the meal and entertainment. All seats are reserved. Tickets must be purchased by noon on the Monday before the Thursday event so we can plan the number of meals to prepare. Tickets will not be sold at the door.\n\nCall the box office at 207-689-2000 or visit between 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Purchase online at www.francocenter.org/shows."
