        "text": "Paper Arts exhibit, reception, tour at Franco Center March 9\n\nLEWISTON—The Franco Center will host an hour-long art exhibit, reception and tour from 11 a.m. to noon Saturday, March 9, to celebrate the art works of 10 students completing its 9-week Onion Foundation-funded paper arts workshop led by local artist Karen Brooks. The public is welcome to attend this free event.\n\n“This arts education program at the Franco Center featured multi-session, hands-on, skill-based art lessons culminating in an exhibit and celebration,” said Denise Scammon, marketing and development director at the Franco Center. “I’ve worked with Karen Brooks in a similar program a few years ago and she is a phenomenal teacher.”\n\nThe Franco Center recognizes the role it plays in providing free arts education opportunities such as this program that is designed to meet the expressed needs and interests of older adults. “The students created art; they didn’t only learn about it. Each class built on skills learned in a previous lesson,” said Scammon. “The students took inspiration for their art from the Franco Center’s beautiful stained-glass windows and architecture.”\n\nAt the exhibit and reception on Saturday, March 9, students and teacher will share their creations and accomplishments in an event that is open to the public. Light refreshments will be served. “We will open the doors at 11 a.m. followed by brief remarks at 11:15 a.m. During the next 45 minutes, students will be available to answer questions about their art works on display,” said Scammon. Visitors can take student-led tours after viewing the art.\n\nThe paper arts workshop was funded in part by the Onion Foundation.\n\nThe Franco Center is at 46 Cedar St., Lewiston, in the former St. Mary’s Church on the corner of Cedar and Oxford streets. Parking is in the mill lot on Oxford St. Handicap access to the building is via an elevator on the Lincoln St. Alley side of the building. Visitors do not have to register, speak French, or belong to a club or membership in order to attend this event."
