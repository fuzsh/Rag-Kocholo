        "text": "2024: Philippe Jobard makes colors and hearts vibrate\n\nTwo balancing passions\n\nAs a child, little Philippe is shy, he has difficulty expressing himself, and his mother worries about it. At eight years old, she enrolled him in a painting class. This form of expression pleases him instantly…\n\nLater, however, he did not want to make it an exclusive passion: he went to study medicine in Paris. In the second year of college, he also took the Fine Arts competition. As he reaches the end of the selection process, the jury, convinced by his work, nevertheless fails him: not wanting to devote himself strictly to pictorial art is fatal to him... No matter! Philippe traces his own path, made of creation, but also of the love of his cardiology patients, who invite him on “a new journey every half hour”. “I see my two activities like a catamaran: there are two hulls, and like that, it’s stable; one balances the other. » His dual passion allows him to take on the role of observer, mirroring society.\n\nThe call of light\n\nHis childhood in Versailles, then his boarding school in Strasbourg and a stint in Burgundy where he inherited a house, left him with an aftertaste of grayness that did not suit him. As a development worker sent to Dakar, he discovered Senegalese fire, a source of multiple inspirations. When he returned to France, the southern sun was a revelation: he settled in Montpellier, where he had lived since 1995. He had found his light.\n\nColor above all else\n\nThe eternal subject of Philippe Jobard’s paintings is color; the landscapes are only pretexts, magnificent visual backgrounds: “What amuses me is trying to make the colors vibrate next to each other, by twisting them or superimposing them. »\n\nPhilippe systematically blackens his frames to fill in the grain of the canvas and avoid white edges. From a photo or his memory, he takes chalk, sketches a score, and all his variations start from there. One of the exercises he does is to limit the colors (3 or 4 maximum): he works on them by mixing them, and varying them, starting with the darkest; this forced limitation of colors makes it possible to give more unity to a painting and to avoid this “parrot” side that it hates!\n\nOil and the knife: the intensity of a caress\n\n“Oil is a rich material, whose texture I like; and the color is much more intense than with acrylic! », enthuses Philippe, who has tested numerous techniques. He works his oils until the color is shimmering, so that it vibrates more. He sometimes leaves it overnight to rework the dough the next day, when it has hardened a little and he can play with different consistencies. In the same way, he does not hesitate to sand certain parts and repaint over them until he obtains the desired result.\n\n“Working with a knife is very pleasant: it’s a bit like a caress. What matters is the angle of the knife. It can be very gentle, if we are tangential to the surface, but we can scratch, too. On the palette, you can mix the colors without them blending completely: it's a little irregular, and then you get surprises when you spread it... and surprises are always nice! »\n\nEmulation and sharing, in constant experimentation\n\nPhilippe Jobard willingly lets himself be inspired by his peers. He loves Nicolas de Staël, another painter crazy about color who also fell in love with the light of the South, but also Serge Poliakoff, with his colored spots; or even Bernard Cathelin, abstract artist inhabited by his maternal Drôme…\n\nIn perpetual research, Philippe refuses to confine himself to a technique or to lock himself into a style. The work of others nourishes his own: observing it maintains his desire to create and his desire to experiment with new things. He would like nothing more than to paint with them! This is also what he does with his painter-architect friend Christophe Marmey, himself fond of superpositions of colors and textures. Because according to him, art should not isolate, but unite.\n\nHe does not cling to his works. Above all, he wants to share them: “The paintings are like children: when they leave, that’s it, the work is done. It’s great for them to go and chat with other people! An artist is truly an artist when he confronts others. »\n\nTo admire the works of Philippe Jobard :\n\nL’Atelier Jobard, in Montpellier and on FB :"
