        "text": "Permanent collection\n\nWhere land, water and air find their space\n\nJune 11 to September 22\n\nMuseum Belvédère shows a collection of works of art by important Frisian painters, loners who often create very personal work far from the larger art centers and without any academic training - artists such as Jan Mankes, Thijs Rinsema, Gerrit Benner, Tames Oud, Boele Bregman, Klaas Koopmans, Willem van Althuis, Sjoerd de Vries and Jan Snijder.\n\nWithin the collection policy, Museum Belvédère has a number of areas of interest that can be traced back to relevant Northern Dutch artist personalities. The collection does not limit itself to movements and styles of art historical periods, but looks for similarities across time - equal similarities between works of art from then, later and now, ranging from figurative to abstract.\n\nThe areas of focus within the permanent collection:\n\nThe work of Jan Mankes – with an emphasis on his Frisian years (1909-1915) – and the work of kindred figuratives.\n\nDutch constructivism from the period 1915-1930 with the work of Thijs Rinsema and Wobbe Alkema as core values.\n\nDutch and Flemish expressionism from the period 1915-1940, with the work of Tinus van Doorn, Jean Brusselmans and Jan Altink as core values.\n\nThe work of Gerrit Benner and Dutch expressionists from the period 1945-1970.\n\nThe poetic and landscape-oriented expressionism, which manifests itself in the work of Frisian artists such as Sjoerd de Vries and Jan Snijder.\n\nThe work of artists who draw on the achievements of classical modern painting and show a spirit of affinity in their work with that of artists belonging to the above groups.\n\nFigurative and abstract painting that belongs to the above categories and refers in any way to landscape aspects - land, light, air and space. Working with a certain degree of stillness is preferred.\n\nKindred spirits in The Netherlands and abroad\n\nIn its acquisition policy, Museum Belvédère initially focused on Friesland, but from 2010 onwards it increasingly focused on the entire north of the Netherlands - Friesland, Groningen, Drenthe and the north of North Holland.\n\nMuseum Belvédère now has an extensive permanent collection that provides insight into the development of modern art in the north and the many parallels and connections. To give context to its core collection, the museum also collects work by artists from other parts of the country and abroad; artists who create from a similar background, circumstance or mentality.\n\nModern and contemporary art in the north of the Netherlands\n\nWith the collection of works of art that initiator and director Thom Mercuur (1940-2016) brought together in the founding phase as a substantive conscience, Museum Belvédère has expanded its boundaries in the years that followed. Its primary aim, based on its substantive principles, was to build an art collection that reflects modern and contemporary art in the north of the Netherlands.\n\nIn addition, it wanted to position itself as the only museum where it is permanently displayed in relation to art from elsewhere.\n\nMikalojus Konstantinas Ciurlionis\n\nBeyond Heaven and Earth\n\n24 February - 9 June 2024\n\nMuseum Belvédère is the first museum in the Netherlands to dedicate an exhibition to the work of Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (1875-1911). Čiurlionis is Lithuania's most important composer and visual artist. Art historians compare him to contemporaries such as Gustav Klimt, Edvard Munch and Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nAlthough the work of Čiurlionis (1875-1911) remained virtually unknown in the west during the years when Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union, many major museums around the world have devoted exhibitions to him in recent decades. In 2024, Museum Belvédère will offer this unique double talent a stage in the Netherlands. The emphasis of the exhibition is on Čiurlionis' later works, painted with tempera paint, in which he finds a symbiosis between visual art and music in his own symbolist style.\n\nBeyond Heaven and Earth\n\nAt the beginning of the last century, Čiurlionis developed his own symbolic style, drawing on Lithuanian sagas, myths, fairy tales and folk beliefs as well as non-Western cultures, ranging from Ancient Egyptian, Indian to Asian. Using the drawing as a basis, Čiurlionis made many tempera paintings in which secrets are evoked and the earthly world is connected to the supernatural.\n\nInstead of reality – as we (re)know it – he depicted a different world with his work. This depiction of unprecedented images and worlds is a common thread through his work. He was never concerned with abstractions, but with the mentally imaginable."
