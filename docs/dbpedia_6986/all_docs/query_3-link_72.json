        "text": "Ongoing research on Middle Neolithic flint technology\n\nIn this blog post we report on our experience using 3D capture and analysis technologies for the study of a particular type of Neolithic flint knapping.\n\nWhen we began our research, the scientific objectives were broad: we wanted to better understand the agro-pastoral societies that occupied the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula between the late fifth and the early fourth millennium BC. In Iberia, this time bracket is commonly referred to as the Middle Neolithic.\n\nOne characteristic of the Middle Neolithic (ca. 4200-3600 cal BC) in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula is the relatively sudden apparition of very elaborate funerary structures with rich grave goods. This phenomenon is called “Cultura dels Sepulcres de Fossa” (cat.) and has been compared to other European phenomena such as the Chassey, Cortaillod or Lagozza cultures. So far, there are more than 650 burials dated within a period of five centuries. Whereas isolated graves or small clusters of graves (5 or less) are the most typical occurrence, some necropolises that include more than 25 graves are also attested. Among them we would like to highlight the particular case of Bòbila Madurell-Can Gambús, a necropolis with approximately 180 burials.\n\nThe cores knapped on barremian-bedoulian flint\n\nSome of the grave goods from the “Sepulcres de Fossa” were imported from very remote areas and/or required a great deal of investment in their production, suggesting very complex networks of exchange across Western Europe and the northern Mediterranean Sea. It is within this context that we can place the appearance of barremian-bedoulian knapped cores and blades in many tombs. Cores and products knapped with this flint arrived from Provence in South-eastern France.\n\nPrevious studies have determined that the cores made from this flint received careful heat treatment and that they were knapped in a very characteristic and standardized way for blade production by means of pressure techniques. In addition, studies suggest that most of these cores were not exhausted when they were deposited in the graves.\n\nLines of 3D research\n\nDespite the fact that former studies of these cores and blades were quite successful from a scientific and analytical point of view, we believed that particular issues could be better addressed using a 3D analysis of digital models of the artefacts. We therefore our study on (1) our understanding of lithic “know-how” and experimental archaeology, (2) a technological and holistic perspective on lithic resource management by Neolithic groups, and (3) the 3D capture and creation of 3D models to further progress in our study of these archaeological materials.\n\nMaterials, methods and extracted data categories\n\nSo far we have scanned 71 cretaceous flint cores which includes nearly all of the artifacts of this category recovered during the last two centuries of archaeological work in the region. The cores were digitized using a Breuckmann Smartscan 3D structured-light scanner, and the models were produced with Rapidform© software. With this digital collection as a basis, we started to develop a series of protocols for producing graphical information, for taking measurements and for extracting other data from the cores. In this sense, We generally went from simple to more complex, as is demonstrated in the following list:\n\nConventional representation and drawing: With 3D models, a high quality conventional representation of a core can be produced in minutes, without requiring the physical item once the initial 3D capture was done.\n\nQualitative “know-how” analysis: Visualization of 3D models has some advantages over physical observation, for example:\n\nThe capability to delete the texture-colour information, leaving only the geometry of the object, which helps to analyze technical traits that are obscured by coloration and contrast.\n\nThe use of precise, ad hoc lighting, using multiple lights, changing angles and adding complementary illumination to observe and highlight specific technical features.\n\nExtracting lineal features of cores and blades: sections, perimeters, convexities, etc.\n\nMeasurement of surface and volume of both whole artefacts or of relevant parts or sections.\n\nExtraction of angular relationships between pressure platforms and flaking surfaces of cores, which is a fundamental criteria for technological lithic studies.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn our nascent experience with 3D scanning technologies and digital model analysis we have found that there are many advantages in using 3D technologies for lithic studies.\n\nFrom a qualitative, “know-how” perspective, we have verified that 3D models are quite useful, because the digital manipulation of the model allows complementary analyses that can be combined with the study of the physical object.\n\nAnd from a quantitative point of view, 3D based metrics represent a higher scale of speed, accuracy and flexibility. Angular, surface and volume data that could be very difficult to obtain otherwise are easily implemented through 3D model measurement and data extraction.\n\nWe believe that our ongoing application of 3D technology to the study of cretaceous flint cores and blades from the “Sepulcres de Fossa” will produce significant results in the future in a number of fields, such as: detailed technical features and knapping procedures, the specific degree of specialization and the possibility of variations or ramifications in the production of blades, volumetric analysis related to raw material transport and management, or the hypothetical amortized value of the cores, among others.\n\nBibliography\n\nBretzke K. & Conard N.
