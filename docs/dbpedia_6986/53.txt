Description: Belonging to different generations, using diverse mediums, and upholding artistic ideas that are often different from one another, what do these artists have in common? They have played a key role in the construction of a history of art in Martinique and in reflecting on the development of a new and specific art. Today, they are developing a work that speaks of a place and a history, while opening up to the rest of the world. This aesthetics of coming together to which they belong, is also an imaginary gathering. Beyond their diversity, they come together around a number of questions or ideas—notions of memory, heritage, traces, identity, ownership, or fragments—to which they ascribe forms and approaches that are always singular.
