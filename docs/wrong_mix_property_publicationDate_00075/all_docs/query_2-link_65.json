        "text": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Children with visual impairments can often find it difficult to learn to read, but one Anchorage teen is working to make that a little easier.\n\nAshley Conlon received her Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award a Girl Scout can get, for a project that will help visually impaired children experience the world of stories in a different way.\n\nConlon spent 13 years as a Girl Scout and noticed there was a need for young children who are blind and visually impaired to learn how to read in the Anchorage School District.\n\n“My mom is one of the orientation and mobility specialists for the Anchorage School District, so her job is teaching travel skills to people who are blind,” Conlon said on Friday. “They do a lot of good work for their community, but they just don’t have enough time on their hands to put all these together, and so I was like, well, I have an opportunity with my Gold Award project to help them in this way.”\n\nShe created “Story Boxes to Support Early Literacy” and donated her time and skills to provide the Special Education Service Agency (SESA) library 35 of the boxes through the school district.\n\nConlon said the story boxes are designed for younger students who may not be reading Braille just yet.\n\n“They help support and connect words on a page in a book to an actual object for students who are blind or visually impaired,” she said. “For example, ‘If You Take a Mouse to School,” there’s a backpack, a lunchbox, pencils, pens, all of those things are in the story box, so that the students who are blind or visually impaired can connect what the word backpack is with the physical backpack.”\n\nShe hopes other Girl Scouts will be inspired to make a difference.\n\n“It teaches young girls how to give back to their community and how to give back to their community effectively, so identifying problems in their community that affected them and their peers and how to help change it,” Conlon said.\n\nAshley was also awarded a scholarship from the Girl Scouts of Alaska Council to help her pay for college at American University in Washington, D.C., a school with an acceptance rate of 41%.\n\nFor those interested in using the story boxes, they are available on the SESA library’s website."
