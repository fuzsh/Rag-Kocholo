Growing up my younger brother had a lot of physical therapy due to his diagnosis of Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus before birth. Spina bifida is a neural tube defect that impacts his mobility. So being in that environment and being involved in the OT and PT appointments in our home during the Birth to 3 programs. Then he later received additional therapies like aquatic and Hippotherapy. Which really let me see what the true impact physical therapists have on those kids’ lives and their families.”\n\nKC Hostetler\n\nAnchorage, AK | Western Governors University\n\nMasters Business Administration\n\nKC is attending Western Governors University to obtain her MBA.

This means that Alaskan kids are suffering more than ever- and their only options to get help are out of state, sometimes thousands of miles away from their families and support systems. As the chair of the VOA Alaska resource development committee, I am spearheading the creation of a capitol campaign to build a recovery campus for struggling youth. We are in the beginning stages, but I am hopeful that the additional education from my MBA, I will be able to bring this project to fruition more effectively, and potentially sooner.”\n\nDanika Brandorff\n\nAnchorage, AK | Dartmouth College\n\nGovernment and Philosophy\n\nDanika is graduating from Robert Service High School this spring.

This motivation comes from a passion for Alaska. I have grown up fortunate enough to live in the mountains my entire life and will not forget their beauty as I fly to college on the other side of the United States. I purposely chose a college that was situated in the wilderness so that I could continue my favorite hobbies like hiking, skiing and climbing in my home away from home, although I will not forget the allegiance I have to my home mountain, Flattop. Because Alaska is so unique in its rich resources and positioning, I want to use every opportunity to gain an education that will allow me to give back as much to our state as it has given to me.”\n\nGannon Albertsen\n\nCamas, WA | George Washington University\n\nPolitical Science\n\nGannon is attending George Washington University studying Political Science.

Thus, despite the outward appearance of the United States and Costa Rica being nothing alike, the people within them, such as my Nana and Carlos, can be very similar. Recognizing this group of people who work so hard but remain plagued with struggles is what’s motivated me to get interested in politics, seeking to enact change that could provide them with support and hope.”"
