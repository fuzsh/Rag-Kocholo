        "text": "Outstanding School Board of the Year\n\nEvery year, AASB awards one Alaskan School Board the Outstanding School Board of the Year award. The Outstanding School Board Award is designed to reflect and honor a school board’s involvement in Board Standards. School Boards should self-nominate for this award. Selection is made by the AASB Awards Committee. This award is presented at the Annual Conference awards luncheon.\n\nCarl Rose Governance Award\n\nThe AASB Board of Directors honored Carl Rose in 2013 by naming the organization’s leadership training program for school members for him after his retirement. Rose was the Executive Director of AASB from 1987 until 2013. During those 26 years, he participated in every major education debate and reform in K-12 education and reshaped AASB into a full-service, statewide, non-profit organization whose motto is “Advocates for Alaska’s Youth.”\n\nThe Carl Rose Governance Award (previously the Outstanding Board Member Of The Year, renamed in 2013) is presented to an outstanding school board member each year at the AASB Annual Conference. The individual receiving the Carl Rose Governance Award is recognized for their commitment, dedication, and accomplishments as a locally elected school board member. Board members can be nominated by their school board and superintendent for consideration of this award. Selection is made by the AASB Awards Committee. This award is presented at the Annual Conference awards banquet."
