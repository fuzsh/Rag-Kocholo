        "text": "Main Text\n\nText at the bottom reads: “‘Alas, Babylon’ captured the fear felt by many over the possibility that a single mistake by one person could lead to a nuclear war.”\n\nText at the lower right continues: “Randy Bragg is at his home in Fort Repose, Florida when he receives a message from his brother in the Air Force comprised of two words: ‘Alas, Babylon.’ It is a code word meaning nuclear war is coming. A U.S. fighter pilot accidentally destroys an ammunition depot in Syria. This incident leads to nuclear war between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Bragg survives along with members of his town who come together to rebuild their community. Unlike many post-apocalyptic novels, Pat Frank’s 1959 novel, ‘Alas, Babylon,’ conveys optimism in a world decimated by nuclear war.”\n\nExhibit Panel Description\n\nAn exhibit entitled “Books,” an illustration of a modern city shows its buildings broken and decaying, with climbing green moss growing from large fissures in building walls, under a smoky, polluted sky.\n\nVisit This Exhibit Panel\n\nIn-person visitation of the B Reactor is only authorized on guided tours offered by the Department of Energy."
