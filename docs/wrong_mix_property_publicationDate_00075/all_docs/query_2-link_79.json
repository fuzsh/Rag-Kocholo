It’s comforting to know the residents of Alaska have such capable watchdogs holding the criminal justice system accountable.”\n\nJudge for Best Legal Affairs Reporting\n\n“Having judged countless competitions, I am not exaggerating in saying that viewers of television news in Alaska are the beneficiaries of some of the finest feature reporting anywhere.”\n\nJudge for TV Best Feature\n\n“I’ve been a contest judge for more than 15 years and in multiple states. This is the most compelling, robust environmental reporting I have ever seen. The competition this year went above and beyond anything I had hoped to watch, listen to or read as a judge. I must salute all of the journalists who submitted entries in this category. Your work goes beyond Alaska to issues about which all Americans should be informed. Really well done!”\n\nJudge for Best Environmental Reporting"
