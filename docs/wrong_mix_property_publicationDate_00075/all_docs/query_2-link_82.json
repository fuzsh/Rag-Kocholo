        "text": "Awards & Recognition\n\nAlaska Afterschool Champion\n\nThe Alaska Afterschool Champion Award recognizes an individual who has gone above and beyond the call of duty to ensure access to high-quality afterschool programing. This individual exemplifies extraordinary dedication to our field and was selected by the Alaska Out-of-School Time Conference Planning Committee.\n\nAfterschool Superheroes\n\nThe Afterschool Superheroes Award recognizes outstanding afterschool professionals who step forward every day to help children in need, support academic growth, provide healthy snacks and meals, and serve as role models.\n\nJulie started her work in Skagway, Alaska as the Community Education director in 1982. Community education included running after school and summer education programs that were supported by a State a Community School grant. In 1987, Julie and her husband moved to Fairbanks, Alaska with their family and Julie began volunteering at the Resource Center for Parents and Children on the Parent Warm Line, answering parent calls, and supporting the mission of child abuse prevention. Soon after her youngest child turned three, Julie was hired to work part time doing community outreach and home visits eventually becoming full time through 1999. Julie also started volunteering in schools at the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District. She was part of the first advisory board for the middle school’s 21st Century Community Learning Center grant application. The FNSBSD received this grant and began to apply for a much larger 21st CCLC grant to serve all the schools in the district, which the district received. Julie was encouraged to apply for the position of Community School director, which included Community School programming along with starting all the 21st CCLC programming at schools and became the new director in the fall of 1999. During Julie’s tenure at FNSBSD she expanded afterschool and summer programming for students and fostered the professional growth of hundreds of afterschool educators.\n\nJulie was President of the Alaska Association for Community Education (AACE) and as a volunteer led organization was part of organizing the yearly AACE conference, supporting Community School professionals across the State, which included afterschool programs. Julie was an Afterschool Alliance Afterschool Ambassador and a White-Riley-Peterson Fellow. Her WRP Fellowship project was to help start the Alaska Afterschool Network. Julie was a founding member of the Network’s Advisory Committee and has served on multiple Network workgroups.\n\nJulie is now semi-retired, traveling with her husband of 42 years and enjoying grandchildren and family time!\n\nA true Alaskan legacy, Representative Young spent his life not just as a champion for our state, but also for our children and youth. As a long-time Co-Chair of the Congressional Afterschool Caucus, he was a staunch advocate for afterschool programs and federal child nutrition programs. He frequently joked that he started the first afterschool meal program in Alaska as a teacher in Mountain Village, AK. Representative Young would make biscuits, beard, oatmeal or other warm meals to feed the students before and after the bell rang at his school. His experience teaching and living and Mountain Village drove his years of work in Washington D.C. to ensure Alaska's kids had a safe place to go during Out-of-School times. Through his bipartisan work in congress, the Nita Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Center program grew to over $1.3 billion fund.\n\nWhether fighting to increasing access to afterschool and child care, stop child exploitation, raising awareness of teen dating violence, or supporting homeless and foster care youth, Congressman Young’s bipartisan legislation never shied away from addressing the root causes of much-needed change. Despite his many years working in D.C., there was never a question that he carried Alaska, and our kids, in his heart.\n\nSuperintendent Dr. Karen Gaborik has been a passionate champion for afterschool and summer programing in the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District throughout the past 18 years. In 2004, as Assistant Principal at Lathrop High School, she supported the creation of one of the country’s first high school 21st Century Community Learning Center. While Assistant Superintendent, she aided in the expansion of the district’s afterschool offerings to include fee-based programs and the Elementary Academy of Science and Technology (EAST) summer program. As Superintendent, she has ensured that afterschool is at the table during district planning meetings and continues to push for greater access to programs. Dr. Gaborik is truly a Champion for Afterschool for continuously advocating for afterschool in her district and throughout the state and country.\n\nRebecca Soza is the Talent Development Manager for the Juneau Economic Development Council where her primary role is directing the FIRST® in Alaska program. Becca is passionate about making high quality STEM experiences accessible to Alaskan students. Through her work at JEDC, Becca supports over 250 robotics teams and a network of approximately 400 volunteers across the state. Becca was born in Puerto Rico, grew up in New Jersey, and then moved to New York City, where she earned her BA in Environmental Science and an MA in Secondary Science Education from Columbia University. She taught middle school science in Harlem, NY prior to making Alaska home 12 years ago. She currently serves on the advisory committee for the Alaska Afterschool Network and is the Co-Chair of the Juneau STEM Coalition.\n\n2016 Alaska Afterschool Champion: Barb Dubovich\n\nBarb Dubovich began her career as an elementary school teacher in rural Alaska. Just 35 short years ago she started at Camp Fire Alaska as a site director at one of the first afterschool programs the agency offered. Barb spent more than 20 years growing Camp Fire’s programs and has for the last 13 years provided leadership as the agency’s CEO.\n\nShe holds a Master of Arts in Education, with a concentration in youth development, and is a recognized YWCA Woman of Achievement. In past years, she served on the National Afterschool Alliance Board of Directors and has held both local and national leadership professional roles. As a strong advocate and voice for children and their families in Alaska, she has worked passionately to ensure all youth have access to nurturing and supportive out-of-school time environments."
