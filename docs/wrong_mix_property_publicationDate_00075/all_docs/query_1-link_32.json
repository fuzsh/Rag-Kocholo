        "text": "15 hours ago, PATCO LCH said:\n\nThis is about nuclear war I take it.\n\nYup, one of several novels from around the same period (late fifties/early sixties) by various authors which cashed in on the (not entirely unfounded) fear of a potential nuclear holocaust. Another book of the same ilk, set in the UK, is Escape to Berkshire by HC Asterley.\n\nNovels from this period do tend to date badly with regard to how survivable a nuclear war would be these days, in the sense that they are from the period before MIRV'ed submarine-launched ICBMs would have been the primary method of delivery for nuclear weaponry, against which there would be little to no defence, since these boomer submarines hide under the ice caps, breaking through to launch their missiles if they ever get the go codes, making it unlikely that their launches could ever be intercepted. The use of aircraft to deliver attacks, making the weapons smaller amongst other things, was of course something which could conceivably be, if not entirely prevented, then at least possibly stopped in fairly large numbers by interceptor aircraft and SAMs, meaning that potentially a nuclear war in the days those books were written, would probably not be entirely devastating, even though it would of course still be horrendous.\n\nSo back when books such as these were written, the primary delivery method was the bomber: Boeing B-47 Stratojets in the case of Alas Babylon's SAC, so not even the more capable B-52, making it likely that US attacks might not be especially successful. The B-47 was not a particularly good aeroplane, being tricky to land, prone to metal fatigue owing to the requirement for it to loft its atomic bombs in order to be able to have enough time to get clear of the blast (a maneuver which had to be trained, placing stress on the airframes). The B-47 wasn't particularly good at its operational cruise altitude of 35,000 feet either, being right on coffin corner at that altitude, but it had to go up there in order to give it the necessary range for its intended role. Despite these shortcomings, it was the backbone of SAC for a number of years, since it was the best they had available until the B-52 was around in large numbers.\n\nThe Soviet counterpart to the B-47 was the Tupolev Tu-16 'Badger'. The Tu-16 by comparison was a very good aeroplane, as evidenced by the fact that Tu-16s were still operational as recently as 1993 with some nations. The Chinese version of it - the Xian H-6 - is in fact still operational with the PLAAF, whereas the B-47 was retired as a bomber back in 1969 although one or two electronic warfare versions of the B-47 soldiered on until the mid-70s.\n\nGiven the disparity in the relative merits of the B-47 and the Tu-16, we can suppose US fears of a nuclear war using these aeroplanes was not entirely unfounded, and practicing for this scenario did lead to worrying some mishaps, for example in the late Fifties: A practice engagement between an F-86 fighter and a B-47 resulted in a mid-air collision over Georgia, whilst the B-47 was carrying a nuclear weapon. In order to make such exercises realistic in terms of weight on board the bombers, B-47s on these exercises would carry an unfused Mark 15 Nuclear bomb (the Mark 15 has a 3.8 megaton yield). The F-86 was destroyed in the collision, with the pilot ejecting safely, but the B-47 kept flying with damage to one of its engines. After several failed attempts to land, the B-47 crew had to drop the unfused Mark 15 nuke over the ocean in order to make their crippled jet controllable enough to then land, which it then did so. The jettisoned nuke was never found.\n\nAlthough we know that the war usitilising primarily nuclear-armed aircraft never took place, we do have a good idea how the bombers involved in such a scenario would have fared, since several USAF B-47s were shot down by Soviet jet fighters when being used on spying recon missions, but no Frontal Aviation Tu-16s were (as far as we know) ever shot down by NATO aircraft. I say as far 'as we know' because there were several incidents which could potentially have triggered an accidental nuclear confrontation which were, for obvious reasons, kept quiet by both sides for very many years, so it is entirely possible that some Russian jets may have been downed and the incidents covered up. One such incident with a B-47 took place in the mid-50s, when a B-47 overflew the Soviet Union at what was thought to be sufficient altitude to avoid MiG-15s being able to intercept it in time, however, what the USAF did not know was that, as a result of some previous penetration flights by USAF aeroplanes, MiG-17s had been stationed in the area, and these were able to intercept it and attack the B-47, the fight continuing all the way into Finnish airspace. The damaged B-47 was able to escape by overflying Sweden, at which point the MiGs broke off and the B-47 eventually landed at RAF Fairford in the UK. This incident was covered up for years by the Russians, the Americans, the Finnish, the Swedish and the British!\n\nEven more worryingly, in 1968, by which time submarines were well capable of launching nuclear missiles, it is speculated that an American and a Soviet submarine may have actually had a battle in the Atlantic. It's never been admitted by either side, but then of course we know that some similar incidents were covered up, so there is some reason to believe this might indeed have occurred. It is most likely to have involved the US submarine USS Scorpion and the Soviet sub, K-129. The Scorpion reportedly radioed that she was pursuing a Soviet target whilst on patrol in May 1968, and that was the last that was heard from her until she was found in October 1968 in 3,000 feet of water with extensive explosion damage. There is some evidence to suggest that a secret search took place a few days before the Scorpion was due to return to base, which does lend credence to the idea that the US knew about her being lost before she was officially overdue from her patrol, so you never know. Kind of scary to think about that sort of stuff."
