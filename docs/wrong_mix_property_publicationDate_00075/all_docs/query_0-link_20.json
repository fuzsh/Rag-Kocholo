        "text": "Wonderful book with modern relevance\n\nWho would have thought a book written in the 1950s would have so many relevant messages and themes for today's world? Even sixty years later, with the Cold War a distant memory, Alas Babylon is a potent, chilling picture of what semi-rural America would look like after a nuclear attack. Today we don't fear a nuclear strike by the Soviets, but we live in fear, or at least heightened awareness, of a terrorist strike. With Iran making daily threats against the US and Israel, with Al Qaeda regaining strength, with Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations solidifying power in the wake of the \"Arab Spring,\" the threats today are different but no less real than they were in Pat Frank's day. So the book is chilling and current even though the specifics of the modern era are obviously very different.\n\nThe book is very well written, with rich characterizations and great emotion throughout. Will Patton proves to be an excellent narrator--I would listen to anything he reads. I've seen him in movies and on TV but wouldn't have thought of him as a good narration candidate. Well, he's wonderful.\n\nThis book is highly recommended for its content, its story, and its reader. Very well done, and well worth my February credit!\n\nReview from an audiobook noobie.\n\nI hope this review resonates for those who haven't been lifelong readers and/or are new to audiobooks. At 34, I am the picture of the guy who was raised on the original Nintendo and bought every new system thereafter, even up to the PS3. Now that I have children, I am beginning to understand the value of reading.\n\nI twice attempted to listen to 2 different audiobooks but had an incredibly hard time following through. I figured I wasn't built for listening. It wasn't until I got this book that I realized all it took was an engaging plot in combination with a good narrator to really be able to enjoy the story.\n\nAlas, Babylon had both. It really rekindled my interest in reading. If your like me and trying to engage yourself in storytelling for the first time, this book is a great place to start. I learned a great lesson also. Don't assume newer books will resonate better. This story was written so long ago and yet it feels like the author was writing based on current events.\n\nIm glad I took heed to the reviews and gave listening another try.\n\nGreat story with superb narration\n\nWould you consider the audio edition of Alas, Babylon to be better than the print version?\n\nThe narration was perfect for this book. The whole time I was listening I was thinking that the author did a great job with the material,\n\nWhat other book might you compare Alas, Babylon to and why?\n\nFunny you should ask because I just got done listening to 1225 Christmas Tree Ln Which is a cedar cove novel. It was about a community of people who helped each other get through difficult situations. This book was about how the community helped each other through hard times. This book was written in 1959 about nuclear war. The other one was just about what to do with 12 orphan puppies. They both had the same theme. Alas Babylon was obviously more intense because the stakes were higher.\n\nWhich scene was your favorite?\n\nWhen the youngest member of the community asked the oldest member of the community for advise. They both were feeling helpless to contribute and they both found out they did have something to offer.\n\nWas there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?\n\nThere were a lot of parts that moved me.it was about surviving and their perseverance to carry on. The main character, especially, decided it is not going to end this way.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI feel like the story and narration came together as a real great experience."
