        "text": "April 29, 2024\n\nLt. Cmdr. Elizabeth “Dawn” Geest, Walk-in Clinic Nurse Manager, and Megan Knutson, Clinical Documentation Integrity Specialist, were recently honored with the Alaska Journal of Commerce’s “Top Forty Under 40” award. The honor recognizes Alaska’s top professionals under the age 40 who have demonstrated professional excellence and a commitment to their community.\n\nGeest is Aleut and a lifelong Alaskan – her family is from Kodiak and Kennicott, Alaska. She has worked at ANTHC for nearly 17 years and has been a Commissioned Officer of the United States Public Health Service since 2011. Geest has held a variety of nursing and nursing leadership roles during her tenure at ANTHC. She has also received several other accolades, including ANTHC Employee of the Year in 2013, March of Dimes Nurse of the Year in 2016, Unit Commendation Medal for her work in ANTHC’s Perinatal Palliative Care Program in 2021, and a Commendation Medal for Excellence in Leadership in 2023.\n\n“Being able to care for Alaska Native and American Indian people is the greatest honor. From a young age, I knew I wanted to be a nurse, be a part of ANTHC, and to give back to the system that had been a huge part of my life,” Geest said. “Taking on various roles in nursing has led me down a pathway into nursing leadership. Being in leadership, you have the opportunity to influence both clinical and campus-wide initiatives, which influence the health care we provide. Having that opportunity is not something you can find every day.”\n\nKnutson has worked at ANTHC since July 2023. She has lived in Alaska for the past 12 years. Prior to joining ANTHC, Knutson worked as a critical care nurse, a critical care coordinator and educator, and quality coordinator.\n\n“I feel I have always had an intrinsic desire to succeed and try to lead by example. Serving Tribal health beneficiaries at ANTHC has given me the opportunity to learn more about the Indigenous cultures here in Alaska and hopefully help bridge the gaps in the health care system, while responding to the cultural needs of our diverse patient population,” Knutson said. “ANTHC has expanded projects to so many service lines to make life better for so many, not only out of necessity, but also out of a true desire to build up the community, and I am very proud to be a part of that.”\n\nReceiving the Top Forty Under 40 award is very meaningful to both Geest and Knutson.\n\n“Receiving this award was something I did not expect. It is a great recognition. When I reflect back on my life, career, and family, I am forever grateful for all the opportunities and mentors I have had. I would not be here without their knowledge, expertise and guidance,” Geest said.\n\n“I was so honored and humbled when I received the call about this award since every recipient is nominated by peers and community members. It was so rewarding to hear that I have made a meaningful impact in my community as well as professionally and am incredibly grateful for everyone who nominated me,” Knutson said.\n\nGeest and Knutson were selected as award recipients among 238 nominees. They were honored on April 26 at the 2024 Top Forty Under 40 Awards Ceremony at the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage.\n\nANTHC congratulates you both and thanks you for your dedication to the people we serve.\n\nLearn more about this year’s Top Forty Under 40 here: https://www.adn.com/alaska-journal/2024/03/15/2024-top-forty-under-40-announced/\n\nBrowse More Stories\n\nShare This Story"
