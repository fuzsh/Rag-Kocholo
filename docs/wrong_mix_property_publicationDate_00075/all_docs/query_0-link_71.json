A two thousand\n\npound door will slam shut\n\neternally beneath an orange grove.\n\nNo one over sixty-five\n\nneed buy a lottery ticket\n\nfor the 1960s kitchen stocked\n\nwith antibiotics, the gun room,\n\nor the mildewed tunnel of seeds\n\nleft to propagate\n\nalong an exit yet unearthed\n\nback into the civilized world.\n\nLet’s call it the tribulation,\n\nnuclear, rapture, asteroid,\n\na Biblical infestation\n\nof palmetto bugs\n\n(winged cockroaches),\n\nArmageddon and all\n\nI’ve ever seen myself\n\nis a speakeasy\n\nhidden beneath a fringed rug\n\nin front of the reservation desk\n\nat The Lakeside Inn downtown\n\nwhere it is said that Al Capone,\n\nwith his knifed jaw, raised lead\n\ncrystal glasses of moonshine:\n\nSalute, Cin Cin,\n\nto the frenzied blasts of light,\n\nall those barking faces,\n\nloose and jawing down."
