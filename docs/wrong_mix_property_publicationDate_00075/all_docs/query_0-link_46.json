When the unthinkable nightmare of nuclear holocaust ravaged the United States, it was instant death for tens of millions of people; for survivors, it was a nightmare of hunger, sickness, and brutality. Overnight, a thousand years of civilization were stripped away.\n\nBut for one small Florida town, miraculously spared against all the odds, the struggle was only just beginning, as the isolated survivorsâmen and women of all ages and racesâfound the courage to come together and confront the harrowing darkness."
