        "text": "U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, today welcomed the announcement of more than $30.4 million for 42 climate resilience projects in tribal communities in Alaska. These awards, made through funding provided by Congress through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and the annual appropriations process, will help tribal communities across the state adapt and bolster their resilience to climate change.\n\n“The selection of more than 40 climate resilience projects across tribal communities in Alaska is a significant step forward in addressing the growing threats and impacts of climate change,” said Vice Chairman Murkowski. “By incorporating Indigenous knowledge and prioritizing community driven initiatives, we can ensure these resources effectively meet the unique needs of each Tribe.”\n\nThe entities listed below will receive awards under the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Tribal Climate Resilience Annual Awards Program. Alaska received about one-quarter of the total of $120 million in awards announced today. More information is available here.\n\nAs Vice Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, a senior appropriator, and one of the lead negotiators and authors of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Senator Murkowski played a key role in authorizing and providing the funding awarded by DOI.\n\nAlaska Award Recipients"
