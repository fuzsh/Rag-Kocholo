Meanwhile, the king of the neighboring realm of Halla, who is the twin brother of the king of Shundi, wants to declare war. Gupi/Goopy and BÄghÄ do everything in their power to dissuade him, and finally it is their singing that demobilizes the troops at the last moment. Reconciled, the twin brothers offer to reward Gupi/Goopy and BÄghÄ with their daughters in marriage. Read More"
