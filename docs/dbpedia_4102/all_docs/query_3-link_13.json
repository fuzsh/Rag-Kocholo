        "text": "Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne is a delightful, fun film for children of all ages. The film ran to packed houses in Bengal for a record fifty-one weeks and was by far the most commercially successful Ray film. Tapen Chatterjee, then a newcomer, admirably plays the role of Goopy and Rabi Ghosh, an experienced performer, plays Bagha in this musical fantasy inhabited by ghosts, kings, crafty ministers, soldiers, magicians, generals, courtiers, princesses, horses and tigers.\n\nAbout six months after its release in Bengal, ray wrote to Marie Seton, “It is extraordinary how quickly it has become part of popular culture. Really there isn’t a single child in the city who doesn’t know and sing the songs (from the film).” The film was not well received abroad though. Andrew Robinson, Ray’s biographer attributes this to its legends, dialogues, wit and lyrics that cannot be translated effectively.\n\nThe film derives its inspiration from Ray’s grandfather - Upendrakisore Ray’s story - 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne'. Ray meticulously designed its characters and composed the music.\n\nThe special effects are definitely not like that of Hollywood films of the era. Its 6 1/2 minute ghost dance is a sequence to watch out for. The imaginative vitality of the visualization and execution make the sequence a visual and aural treat. Ray combined live action, shadow puppets and Indian percussion instruments –Ghatam, Mridamgam, Mursring and Ganjra to create the mesmerizing sequence."
