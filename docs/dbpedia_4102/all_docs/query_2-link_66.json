        "text": "by Arthur Vincie\n\nWhen you think of fantasy films, you probably think of Lord Of The Rings, the Harry Potter series, Pan’s Labyrinth, or possibly the Marvel movies. On TV there’s Once Upon a Time, The Witcher, Game of Thrones. These are mostly quite good (except for The Hobbit – life’s too short). These are largely big-budget projects set in a vaguely European setting, often using Medieval lore, swords and sorcery. Often the protagonists are human (or human-like), male, white. These can be very broadly categorized as “Eurofantasy.” Pan’s Labyrinth is an exception, a fairly low budget film ($14M) set during World War II, whose protagonist is a young girl.\n\nBut the genre is much bigger than this. In the last ten years alone, Nnedi Okorafor, Saladin Ahmed, Max Gladstone, N.K. Jemisin, Nalo Hopkinson, Aliette de Bodard (to name a few) have written books set in a dizzying array of locales, with worlds and systems of magic built on entirely different principles, featuring a much more diverse cast of characters.\n\nThere are also some incredible fantasy films that use different story structures, are set in different cultures, and were produced on lower budgets. If you’re a filmmaker who’s interested in making fantasy films and want to do something different, these films are worth studying. I’ve put together a short list, and after describing them in as spoiler-free a way as possible, I’ll get into why it’s worth hunting these films down. Some of these you’ll really have to hunt for, because they’re not all available for streaming. You can see a video where I discuss a longer list.\n\nTHE FILMS\n\nGabbeh: directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf, 1996 (Iran).\n\nMakhmalbaf is a giant in Iranian cinema. Gabbeh is set among a tribe of pastoralists in Iran. They herd sheep and goats, and make beautiful hand-dyed and woven carpets (gabbeh is the name of the type of carpet). It starts with an older couple arguing about who’s going to wash and clean their gabbeh in the stream nearby. The gabbeh turns into a young woman, who describes her journey in flashbacks – life in her tribe, her pining for an outsider her father doesn’t want her to marry, her uncle’s own search for love. What’s her relationship to the older couple? The film meanders and weaves in and out of people’s lives, and has this wonderful, poetic sensibility. There’s almost no reliance on special effects, only some inventive editing and cinematography.\n\nUncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives: directed by Apitchatpong Weerasethakul 2010 (Thailand).\n\nRay is probably best known for the Apu Trilogy, a series that chronicles the life (from childhood through fatherhood) of Apu, born into a poor rural family in Bengal, who comes to Kolkata. It’s a very poetic story of the hardships of the rural-to-urban migration and the difficulties of class mobility.\n\nRay also had a playful side, and it comes out in this film. The titular characters – Goopy and Bagha – are ejected from their respective villages for being terrible musicians. They’re goodhearted but quite hapless. They meet by chance in the forest. As night comes, the forest tiger shows up. Scared as hell, they play together to try and calm him down. This attracts the forest ghosts, and the Ghost King, who likes their music, decides to give them several magical boons. This enriches their lives considerably, and eventually gets them appointed as court musicians to the king of Shundi. But this also puts them in the middle of an impending war between Shundi and the King of Halla, who wants to take over the kingdom with the aid of Borfi the sorcerer. The film is hilarious and yet is also a serious reflection on power and class.\n\nAfter Life, directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, 1998 (Japan).\n\nThis is the first film shot entirely in the Inuit language, and is based on the legend of the title character. He’s in a life-long struggle with the leader of his camp, Sauri, and Sauri’s son Oki. It’s a complex story that involves jealousy between Atanarjuat and Oki over Atuat, who Oki wants to marry; a curse passed down from a shaman, Tungajuaq, that affects everyone in the camp; and the ways in which intergenerational feuds lead to vicious cycles. The film is shot in an understated way, with very little music and few effects.\n\nThese films are very distinct from each other, made by filmmakers drawing from different cultures and traditions. It’s always dangerous to try to draw parallels between such diverse works of art, especially since I’m not a member of any of these cultures. I’ll look instead at commonalities of technique, with an eye toward what you can adapt for your own work.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY / CAMERAWORK\n\nMany of these films utilize wide shots that enlarge the environment and diminish the size of the characters. The camera is either very still or moves fairly slowly. Notice these shots from Women Without Men, Gabbeh, Uncle Boonmee, and Atanarjuat.\n\nIn Women Without Men, whenever one of the characters enters the orchard, the camera glides along a stream or a footpath, allowing us to take in the scale of the place:\n\nOn the other hand, keeping the focus tightly on your characters (per After Life and Goopy Gyne) can help you establish their POV. To the team in After Life, dealing with dead people is just their job. To Goopy and Bagha, the riches of Shundi’s palace and the dangers of Halla are constant sources of amazement and fear.\n\nEDITING – PACE AND STYLE\n\nThese films are more slowly paced than a typical Hollywood fantasy. The excellent Mad Max: Fury Road has about 3000 shots in its 2-hours runtime (the cinematographer Vashi Nedomansky, ACE has a fascinating dive into shot length on his site), with an average shot length of 2.1 seconds. Atanarjuat is 2 hours 45 minutes, and much of the film plays out in long takes. Gabbeh is 70 minutes long. Uncle Boonmee has shots that last 30 seconds or longer. Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne is more fast-paced, particularly during the musical numbers. Even so none of these films would be considered “fast.”\n\nThe recent spate of “one shot movies” suggests to me that audiences are okay with longer takes, provided that something interesting happens. Whether it’s stunning visuals or absorbing depictions of daily life, something is always happening in these films.\n\nIn Atanarjuat, a good deal of time is spent on daily life – hunting, gathering, food preparation, building houses. But this is also when the most serious dramatic conversations happen.\n\nRather than go for a strictly “realistic” look, these effects emphasize their “larger than life” quality. Wes Anderson used this approach in Grand Budapest Hotel, using miniature effects without any attempt at “realism.” Rather than detract from the story, this use of stylized effects can get audiences more invested in the films. Michel Gondry does this as well in The Science of Sleep. These effects are evocative (poetic) rather than descriptive.\n\nWhat to Adapt: There may be simple ways to accomplish something in your film – either by using older tricks like jump cuts, or doing something deliberately lo-fi - rather than striving for realism. You can’t compete with Marvel’s budget, so what does taking the opposite approach do for your story?\n\nACTING\n\nIn these films the acting is mostly pretty low-key. Even in Goopy Gyne, everyone takes the world they’re in seriously. This is key to creating believable fantasies. Your cast has to interact with ghosts, gods, time travel, and other things outside our “normal” experience, as though they’re a part of their everyday world. When Boonmee’s wife’s ghost shows up for dinner, everyone quickly comes to accept her presence. The orchard in Women Without Men is something the characters don’t question once they enter. The magic duel at the beginning of Atanarjuat between Tungajuaq and the leader of the band, which kicks off the story, shocks everyone for its results, but not that it happened. The team in After Life are doing a job.\n\nWhat to Adapt: You may have to explain the rules of the world a bit to the actors and the crew, or at least give them some context so they understand that what’s happening is normal; but the main thing is to have them treat the fantastic elements as though they’re part of their everyday experience.\n\nWRITING\n\nGabbeh, Uncle Boonmee, and Women Without Men make wonderful use of voice-over. Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne has several excellent songs. The characters in Atanarjuat and After Life constantly try to figure out their life choices. All these films have political and philosophical threads. Uncle Boonmee is deliberately ambiguous, Women Without Men more directly allegorical. One thing that’s constant is that the viewer is largely dropped into these films without much of an explanation as to the “rules.” This may alienate some viewers, but it’s a key strength of the genre. In Lord of the Rings there’s no real explanation for how magic works, why orcs run from daylight, or why elves live forever.\n\nThe filmmakers worked within their cultures’ fantasy paradigms, but they were also inspired by other sources. Goopy Gyne is based on a children’s story that Ray’s grandfather illustrated. Boonmee director Weerasethakul’s father died of kidney failure. Atanarjuat is based on an Inuit legend passed on through oral tradition. But writer Paul Apak Angilirq and director Kunuk interviewed elders for their versions of the story, combined them, and then made significant alterations for the script. Women Without Men is based on a novel by Shahrnush Parsipur, which inserted the symbolic orchard in the midst of real events (the coup against Mossadegh). Much of director Neshat’s art and photography focuses on western imperialism (in Iran in particular) and gender, identity and Islam (I’m oversimplifying her work). Kore-Eda (After Life) began his career as a documentarian. One of his greatest influences is British filmmaker Ken Loach, who makes films about working class life, labor rights, and poverty. All of these directors blended their personal, cultural and worldly influences; and it’s clear that they understood the rules of their worlds even if they didn’t explicitly state them in the script. The resulting films are very big conceptually, even if they lack huge budgets or set pieces.\n\nYour script can operate at this level as well, as long as you understand the rules of your world. Fantasy writer N.K. Jemisin has written some excellent advice on world-building. If you want to write something that’s really different, it’s important to be conscious of and reach past familiar fantasy tropes, and understand your personal connection to the material.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis is just a small sample of films. I recommend the Brother Quays’ Piano Tuner of Earthquakes; every film by Hayao Miyazaki and the late great Satoshi Kon; the other films I discuss in the video above; A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night by Ana Lily Amirpour, and low-budget horror and sci-fi films, since they operate on similar principles. Be brave, be big, be fantastic!"
