        "text": "This piece will trace Beckett's travel as world literature in two Indian works in Bengali (a play and a film) that are inspired by Waiting for Godot. I will discuss how these works introduce an effect of 'unworlding' into Beckett's dramatic 'world' by rendering it opaque and unstable, among other things. When playwright John Arden criticized Samuel Beckett for not writing plays about Algerian crisis, Beckett's American director, Alan Schneider said, all his plays were 'about Algeria' (Gussow 1996: 160). Is it not this unlocatable nature of Beckett's work that makes it open to intercultural translation? The difficulty of attributing a geopolitical name to the 'country road' of Waiting for Godot or the 'bare interior' of Endgame turns these places into a global everywhere. It will not be enough to say that this makes Beckett's works universal. Logically speaking, we are looking at a specific universal, attained through subtraction and not through inductive generalization. Beckett would subtract place names and cultural details until he exorcized all the 'demented particulars' (Beckett 1936: 12). Apart from his hybrid cultural identity as an Irish Protestant, migrating to Paris and straddling two languages as a bilingual writer, the cultural opacity of his oeuvre makes him an interesting case for world literature. Beckett's world is as Irish as it is French. This makes it no less Bengali or Indian, as we shall see. Deformations of 'world' as a culture-specific notion in Beckett's texts ironically add to their capacity for travelling across national and cultural frontiers.\n\nSatyajit Ray (1921-1992) and Akira Kurosawa (1910-198) are the world-famous filmmakers. Coincidentally, they were contemporary and friends. They were also sources of inspiration for each other. Their films are a landmark example of creative cine-language. In most of their movies, nature and the environment are as important as the human characters. Rather, the human being is guided by the nature to act upon. Their movies incorporate nature as an essential component for human activities. Portrayal of nature, in Ray's movies, is different from that of Kurosawa. To Ray's films environment and nature comes as part of daily life or seasonal change, whereas Kurosawa represents nature as phenomena like rain, volcanic eruptions, tsunami and earthquakes. This difference is the result of separate geographical conditions of India and Japan. Japan is environmentally very sensitive country, whereas India, due to its larger landmass, does not feel such sensitivity. Pather Panchali (1955) is considered as a masterpiece of parallel cinema and reflects reality. The film was made with on location shooting technique. This film, therefore, depicts the nature and environment of Bengal. In Dreams (1990) imagination is more important than reality. Natural phenomena are all constructed according to the theme. The nature and environment, shown in Pather Panchali, are integral part Bengali/Indian life and culture, but the same is not true for Dreams. The nature, depicted in this film, has global appeal and situations created in it are more close to universal human life, breaking the boundaries of any particular geographic location. Environment in cinema is, essentially, a cultural reflection. But, at the same time, it can surpass the limits of time and space. Hence, environmental issues taken up by Ray and Kurosawa in their respective films share a common message and theme and sensitize all kind of viewers.\n\nPartha Chatterjee argues in The Nationalist Resolution of the Women’s Question that nationalists created a dichotomy revolving around ‘ghar’ (home) and ‘bahir’ (world) which could be transposed into an analogous dichotomy of outer and inner spheres of sovereignty. The outer sphere is the domain of statecraft, political action and material interest and it is here that the superiority of the West is recognised. The inner sphere of sovereignty is concerned with the spiritual. It is the repository of cultural tradition and women embodied it. Women are thus transfigured into a cultural sign rather than as a material being with social and political needs. The denial of agency and subjectivity is an effect of the dialectical process where the material being of womanhood is transformed into a disembodied sign. The colonial regime thus embarked upon a process of codification backed by a seemingly rigorous and empirical scholarship which determined that identity in India was crystallised on the poles of two essential units – that is religious community and caste. The womanhood which signified an authentic national tradition in the discourse was associated with a reformulated Hinduism which retained the principle of communal difference which was challenged by the colonial state and the minorities. On the other side of the spectrum, we have something like the ‘Dasi episode’ in Raja Rao’s Kanthapura which hinges upon the narrated conflict between the shopkeeper of Kanthapura and the phantasmagoric Muslim character Rahman Khan. It undermines the Gandhian ideology and reveals its communal underbelly. Although the Nation is meant to stand for horizontal comradeship, inequality remains a daily occurrence in its body. In conceiving its overarching ideologies it places the dominant group at the center pushing the minority population to the periphery. In The Pitfalls of National Consciousness, Frantz Fanon argues that nationalism instead of being the embracing crystallisation of the people becomes a hollow travesty in which nation is passed over for the race and the tribe is preferred to the state. Rahman Khan is thus sentenced to six months imprisonment, a symbolic incarceration which underlines the anxiety with regard to Muslims. Dasi is a pawn in the conflict since the charge laid against Rahman Khan was that he tried to murder Subba Chetty as he had stolen his mistress. These kinds of limitations reduce nationalism to a monolithic ideology inadequate for human beings given to inherent multiplicity and seeming contraries that needs to be synthesised through a process of soulful negation to create the wholesome person."
