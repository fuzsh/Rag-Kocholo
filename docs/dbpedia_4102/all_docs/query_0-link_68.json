        "text": "This paper offers a critique of Satyajit Ray’s literature for young adults, a major part of which was dedicated to his popular and favorite sleuth, Feluda. The primary contention of this paper is that, since it was conceived on the pages of the Ray family magazine Sandesh, the Feluda stories have followed a rather taut, moral architecture that cannot be explained only in terms of categories that literature for young adults or children permit. The first part of the paper discusses at length the possible origins and formative influences of Ray’s sleuth. The second part proposes three hypotheses that consider the entrenched phallocentrism and gentrified eco-system of the stories as both a psychoanalytic and a cultural problematic.\n\nThe act of writing, owing to the permanence it craves, may be said to be in continuous interaction with the temporal flow of time. It continues to stimulate questions and open up avenues for discussion. Writing people, events and relationships into existence is a way of negotiating with the illusory. But writing falters. This paper attempts a reading of Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne in terms of power politics through the lens of the manipulation of written codes and inscriptions in the film. Identities and cultures are constructed through inscriptions and writings. But in the wrong hands, this medium of communication which has the potential to bring people together may wreck havoc on the social and political system. Writing, or the misuse of it, in the case of the film, reveals the nature of reality as provisional. If writing gives a seal of authenticity to a message, it can also become the casualty of its own creation. Key words: Inscription, Power, Politics, Writing, Social system\n\nThe article delves into the recesses of an almost non-existent genre in Bengali cinema; that of the modern science fiction (SF). It proposes that the SF imagination in Bengali cinema is driven by the mode of fantasy and is an example of an alternative moder-nity which celebrates the technological aspirations of the community along with the indigenous cultural elements of Bengal. The template of fantasy also changes over time from magic to media-induced hallucinations to trace the contemporary techno-media culture, addressing the desires of a media savvy and image-addicted society.\n\nResumo: Este artigo é sobre os filmes documentários de Satyajit Ray (1921-1992). Os seus documentários apresentam uma tapeçaria rica em criatividade, uma cinema-tografia requintada, uma música expressiva e, acima de tudo, uma maneira extraordi-nária de contar histórias. Em todos eles, Ray escreve o roteiro, compõe a música e realiza. Neste artigo, tentei analisar o seu estilo de representar os factos em filmes de não-ficção. Palavras-chave: biografias, filosofia tagoreana, narração, \"verdade mais profunda\". Resumen: Este artículo trata sobre las películas documentales de Satyajit Ray (1921-1992). Los documentales de Ray presentan un rico tapiz de guión pensativo, cinema-tografía exquisita, música expresiva y sobre todo una forma extraordinaria de contar historias.

Ray's documentaries present a rich tapestry of thoughtful script, exquisite cinemato-graphy, expressive music and above all an extraordinary way of story-telling. In all of them, Ray has written the script, composed the music and given the direction. In this article, I have tried to analyse his style of representing the facts in non-fiction films. Résumé: Cet article traite des films documentaires de Satyajit Ray (1921-1992). Les documentaires de Ray présentent une riche tapisserie d'écriture réfléchie, une ciné-matographie exquise, une musique expressive et surtout une manière extraordinaire de raconter des histoires. Dans tous, Ray a écrit le scénario, a composé la musique et dirigé la réalisation. Dans cet article, j'ai essayé d'analyser son style de représentation des faits dans les films de non-fiction. Mots-clés: biographies; philosophie tagore; vix off ; \"vérité plus profonde\".\n\nIn this paper I intend to bring to light the cinematography of Satayjit Ray with a special reference to his movie Charulata (1964). The main focus in my paper is on dealing of human relationships and bringing to light the foulness of the so called fouled or broken nest of Bhupati and Charu. The paper also portrays Charu as a new woman who is bold enough to assert herself and capable of bringing forth the right. Key Words: Assertion, Patriarchy, Foulness, Relationships"
