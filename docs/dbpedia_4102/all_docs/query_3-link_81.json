        "text": "Gupi Gyne O Bagha Byne, a Bengali short story written for children by Upendrakishore Raychoudhury (1863-1915), was first published in Sandesh, the children's magazine, in the early 1910s. It is the story of two friends, singer Gupi Gyne and dholak1 player Bagha Byne, and their humorous exploits.\n\nIn later years, the writer's grandson, Oscar-winning Kolkata2 film director Satyajit Ray (1921-1992), took the characters' fame to new heights, not only filming the story, but also adding two more stories and films, to make it a trilogy.\n\nThe Original Short Story - Synopsis\n\nGupi Kyne, the son of the grocer Kanu Kyne, knows only one song which he always sings, although he has no musical abilities. His singing is horrible enough to chase away his father's customers, and even to stop the cows from grazing. One day, a frustrated Kanu chases him with a large bamboo in his hand. Scared of his father and of the village cowherds, Gupi runs away to the forest and is happy to practise his singing there.\n\nIn the neighbouring village, Panchu Pyne's son is very fond of playing the dholak. He makes strange faces while playing, and roars out like a bagh or tiger. This earns him the nickname Bagha Byne or Bagha the Music Player. Now, the villagers get so tired of his loud beating on the dholak that they bribe him with ten jars of sweets and ask him to leave the village. Bagha moves from village to village, suffering the same fate in each, until he reaches the forest where Gupi is and meets him. Gupi now calls himself Gupi Gyne, or Gupi the Singer.\n\nThe Pair Receive Their Magic Powers\n\nThe pair decide to go to the nearby King to present their music. On the way they have to cross a river. Since they do not have any money to pay the boatman, the latter asks them to make music for him. They agree. However, as soon as the music starts, the passengers panic, and the boat topples. The duo manage to swim to the bank, clinging on to the dholak, and enter the dense forest. The two friends are sure that they will be eaten by tigers, and decide to sing and play music one last time. A band of ghosts dwelling in the forest appear and listen to their music; they are so impressed that they take the duo to their abode to sing at their chief's son's wedding. At the end, the ghosts are very pleased and confer three boons - or favours - on the musicians.\n\nThey become very skillful musicians, and when they sing and play the dholak, all listeners freeze for as long as the music goes on.\n\nThey are given a special bag by the ghosts, from which they can get any clothing and any food they want.\n\nThey are each given a pair of enchanted shoes, with which they can transport themselves to any place in a moment.\n\nGupi and Bagha at the Palace\n\nEndowed with magical powers, Gupi and Bagha reach the King's palace. The guards stop them, but they transport themselves to the King's bedroom with the help of their magic shoes. The King is shocked, seeing the duo appear out of nowhere. They are chased by the guards, and they panic. They are easily captured, and are thrown into the prison.\n\nBagha is very upset, as he has lost his dholak in the commotion. Gupi tries to cheer him up, and the pair then enjoy pulao3 and other mouth-watering delicacies from the magic bag. They escape after two days, on the day they were to be tried.\n\nClad in royal robes, they again arrive at the palace. The King and his retinue do not recognise them, and welcome them as honoured guests.\n\nIn the meantime, the daroga4 comes with the news of the disappearance of the prisoners. The King and his retinue are sure they must have been ghosts, otherwise they could not have disappeared despite rigid security arrangements. They decide to burn Bagha's dholak. Hearing this, Bagha starts wailing and crying loudly. People think he is very ill, and the royal physician treats him with painful medicines. However, this delays the burning of the dholak.\n\nThe daroga recognises the pair, and informs the King. This information frightens the King, as he still believes they are actually ghosts. They plan to call for an exorcist, but are too scared to confront the ghosts, and so they plan to burn them to death while they are sleeping. There is a beautiful out-house in the King's garden, and the friends are asked to stay there. The guards also place Bagha's dholak in the out-house.\n\nReaching the out-house, Bagha is ecstatic to find his dholak there. At night, Gupi and Bagha decide to roam in the garden singing and playing the drum. In the meantime the daroga gets inside with his guards and sets the cottage on fire. Just at this moment, Gupi and Bagha start singing and playing the dholak. The daroga and his guards freeze inside the burning cottage, and are burned alive.\n\nThe Duo Return Home\n\nThe two friends now decide to visit their own villages. They reach the forest where they had first met. Being glad and nostalgic, they start making music. In the meantime, a gang of bandits are escaping after looting the treasury of the Kingdom of Halla and kidnapping two princes. The bandits freeze as a result of Gupi and Bagha's music. The King of Halla's guards capture them. The King is grateful, and offers the friends the position of royal musicians at his court. They accept, but ask for a few days in order to visit their villages and their parents.\n\nA repentant Kanu Kyne is glad to see his son back. However, Bagha does not receive the same treatment. His parents have passed away a few days before, and his fellow villagers are not happy to see him return. They beat him up and chase him out. Bagha flees until he reaches Gupi's house, where Gupi's parents welcome him with immense hospitality.\n\nWorking for the King of Halla\n\nAfter a few days, the duo leave for Halla. They are appointed the court musicians. One day, the King of Halla receives a declaration of war from the King of Shundi. Now, this is the same king who had tried to burn Gupi and Bagha to death. When they find out, they decide to try and stop the war.\n\nThe duo travel to Shundi. The King's courtiers and subjects are busy with rituals in front of a temple. The musicians, dressed in royal attire, perch at the top of the temple's tomb, and drop down jars of never-before-seen sweets, which they have acquired from their magic bag. The people are unable to see Gupi and Bagha clearly because of the smoke from the incense sticks and the sacred fire. In the pandemonium caused by the kansar5-bells ringing and the conch shells blowing, the people mistake them for gods throwing down sacred sweets from the sky, and rush to grab them. The next evening, even the King of Shundi arrives at the temple to have his share. The duo appear in front of him, the King mistakes them for gods, and when they want to embrace him, the latter feels obliged and elated. Gupi and Bagha take hold of him and transport him and themselves to Halla.\n\nThe King of Halla is overjoyed; he forgives the King of Shundi, but takes away his kingdom. The story ends with the duo getting married to the princesses of Halla, and becoming the Kings of half of Shundi.\n\nThe Film Trilogy\n\nSatyajit Ray's Goopy-Bagha trilogy of films make some minor changes from the original story. The friends are called Gopinath Gyne (Goopy) and Baghanath Byne (Bagha). The instrument Bagha plays is a dhol rather than a dholak - that's a slightly different type of double-ended drum, struck with a drum-stick on one end and the hand on the other. Goopy was played by Tapen Chatterjee and Bagha was played by the popular comedian Robi Ghosh. The films were basically made keeping the young viewers in mind and are strewn with elements of comedy and hilarious scenes. This series of musical comedies is interspersed with wonderful songs, written and composed by Ray himself, and sung by Anup Ghosal6. The trilogy comprises the movies:\n\nGoopy Gyne O Bagha Byne (The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha)\n\nHirak Rajar Deshe (The Kingdom of Diamonds)\n\nGoopy Bagha Phire Elo (The Return of Goopy and Bagha)\n\nGoopy Gyne O Bagha Byne (The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha)\n\nStory: Upendrakishore Raychoudhury\n\nScreenplay, lyrics, music, costume and direction: Satyajit Ray\n\nCamera: Soumendu Roy\n\nArt director: Banshi Chandragupta\n\nCast: Tapen Chatterjee, Robi Ghosh, Santosh Dutta (King of Shundi and King of Halla), Jahar Ray (Minister of Halla), Harindranath Chatterjee (Borfi the Magician)\n\nProducers: Nepal Dutt and Asim Dutt (Poornima Pictures)\n\nSatyajit Ray made the first of the trilogy films based on his grandfather Upendrakishore Raychoudhury's story Goopy Gyne O Bagha Byne. The only black and white film of the trilogy, it was released in 1968. The film is inspired by the story and has many of the same characters, but differs significantly in detail.\n\nSynopsis\n\nGopinath Kyne, son of the grocer Kanu Kyne, lives in the village of Amloki. He loves singing, but has no musical ability. The elderly villagers talk him into going to the King's court to sing for the King, under the name Gopinath Gyne. The King is appalled by his horrible music, and banishes him from the kingdom. While loitering in the bamboo forest7, Gopinath meets the drummer Baganath Byne from the village Horttuki, who has suffered the same fate. At night, the duo meet the King of the Ghosts, who confers three boons on them:\n\nThat they can get to wear any clothing by clapping each other's hands and uttering the name of the dress type; and also, can get any food by clapping each other's hands and uttering the name of the dish.\n\nThat they can reach any place in a moment, with the aid of a pair of enchanted shoes for each, by clapping each other's hands and uttering the name of the place.\n\nThat they can sing and play the drum with great skill, and all listeners will freeze for as long as the music goes on.\n\nEarly next morning, Goopy tests his singing skills, and to his utmost glee, he discovers he has developed a melodious voice. He's also joined by Bagha on his drum, who is now adept in playing the dhol. After that, they also make various delicacies appear by their magical power, and have a sumptuous meal.\n\nThe Pair Go to Shundi\n\nThe duo hear about a music competition to be held in the court of the King of Shundi, and decide to compete. After visiting Hundi and then Jhundi by mistake, the musicians finally transport themselves to Shundi using their magical powers, take part in the contest, and emerge the winners. They are appointed as the royal musicians.\n\nThe subjects of Shundi are all speaking-impaired, due to an epidemic that has struck the country. The royal family escaped the calamity as they had been away on a pilgrimage during the mishap.\n\nA Sinister Plan\n\nIn the meantime, the Minister of Halla is planning an attack on Shundi. With the aid of Borfi the Magician, he treats the King of Halla with magic potions to convert the humble, meek, amicable King to a violent and aggressive one who loves to declare war on neighbouring kingdoms. The King of Shundi is also meek and mild, and the country has no army or defensive capabilities. The Minister of Halla is actually involved in a sinister plan to usurp the throne once he manages to conquer Shundi. The King of Halla, under the effect of the magic potion, sends a letter to the King of Shundi declaring war. The latter is horrified and upset, as the King of Halla is actually his own brother. Goopy and Bagha decide to travel to Halla to try and stop the war. The King of Shundi promises to marry his daughter, Princess Monimala, to one of them, if they succeed.\n\nThe Musicians Investigate\n\nThe two friends reach Halla using their magical powers and, in the disguise of farmers, visit the King's palace. The King orders farmers who had defaulted on taxes to be beheaded, and in order to escape Goopy has to sing and freeze the people around him. Goopy's magic singing overpowers the effect of Borfi's magic potion, bringing the King of Halla back to his senses.\n\nThe two musicians smell a rat. They visit the minister's room while he is conspiring with Borfi. They learn his sinister plans, and petrify them both with their enchanted music. They also take some of Borfi's magic potions, including one that he had concocted to bring back the speaking capabilities of the citizens of Shundi.\n\nBorfi has also prepared a more powerful potion, this time to convert the King's attitude. The King is again thirsty for blood, eager to go for a war with Shundi.\n\nSetback\n\nJust when everything seems to be going well, things take a turn for the worse. Halla's guards capture Goopy and Bagha while they're asleep, and throw them into the prison. Imprisoned, without their enchanted shoes and Bagha's drum, the duo are frustrated, but they still have Goopy's voice. Goopy sings a song. Once again his music overpowers Borfi's magic and the King escapes from its influence. An infuriated minister visits the gaol and threatens the pair, ordering them never to sing again without his permission.\n\nWhen the minister tries to treat the King with Borfi's magic potion once again, the King at last relents. He refuses to take the potion. He recollects that he was kidnapped as a child by a bandit, and was brought to Halla. He also recalls that Shundi is ruled by his brother.\n\nThe wily magician now puts a spell on the King to keep him unconscious for three days. Now, with further help from Borfi, Halla's vast, laid-back and indisciplined army is also rejuvenated and brought to discipline. At this point, Borfi vanishes from the story, as he disappears into thin air.\n\nEscape!\n\nIn the meantime, Goopy and Bagha lure the hungry cell guard with a meal adorned with a variety of delicacies, and escape. They rush to the spot where they were captured, and to their utter delight find their magic shoes and Bagha's drum lying intact.\n\nAs the Halla army sets off for Shundi, Goopy and Bagha appear with Goopy singing out loud and Bagha playing his dhol. The army stand still, even the camels. Goopy points out the trials and tribulations of war in his song, and urges the army to refrain from fighting. At the end of the song, the musicians use their magic to make innumerable urns of sweets come down from the sky, and the hungry army forgets everything to run after the delicacies. The King too is freed of Borfi's magic, and runs out of the palace. In the commotion, which makes the war impossible, the duo take hold of the King, and transport him to the King of Shundi. The two kings recognise each other as brothers, and the film ends on the happy note of the citizens of Shundi getting back their voices, while Goopy and Bagha get married to Princess Monimala of Shundi and Princess Muktaamala of Halla respectively.\n\nAwards\n\nAward for best direction, New Delhi, 1968\n\nPresident's Gold and Silver Medals, New Delhi, 1970\n\nSilver Cross, Adelaide, 1969\n\nBest director, Auckland, 1969\n\nMerit Award, Tokyo, 1970\n\nBest Film, Melbourne, 1970\n\nHirak Rajar Deshe (The Kingdom of Diamonds)\n\nStory, screenplay, costume design, lyrics, music and direction: Satyajit Ray\n\nCamera: Soumendu Roy\n\nArt Director: Ashok Bose\n\nCast: Tapen Chatterjee, Robi Ghosh, Soumitra Chatterjee (Udayan, the Teacher at Hirak), Utpal Dutt (King of Hirak), Santosh Dutta (King of Shundi and Gobuchandra, the Scientist at Hirak)\n\nProducer: Department of Information and Culture, Govt of West Bengal\n\nHirak Rajar Deshe was released in 1980.

They are now fathers to one baby each. However, the two adventurous souls are bored sitting constrained in the palace. Just when they decide they need a holiday, the King of Shundi asks them to represent him in Hirak in their anniversary celebration. The duo are overjoyed.\n\nThe Tyranny of the King\n\nThe King of Hirak is a tyrannical dictator. Just as Halla's minister had the sinister Borfi working for him, the King of Hirak has a scientist, Gobuchandra. The latter has invented a brain-washing machine. It 'washes' rebels' brains of any thoughts of sedition, and implants verses in praise of the King. The kingdom thrives on a huge diamond mine, in which miners are exploited to dig out diamonds.\n\nThe King pulls down the village school, as education imparts knowledge, a sense of ethics and the power of reasoning. When the King's guards set fire to his books and scriptures, Udayan, the sole teacher of the school, rebels. He manages to save a few of his books, and escapes into the nearby caves and forests. The King orders his council of ministers and guards to capture Udayan.\n\nThe King also wants to shut the mouths of those who are critical. Charandas, a bard, comes to the court and sings a song in which he speaks of farmers who grow golden crops but go without a square meal twice a day, diamond miners who go without any wealth, while the good reside in broken huts and the bad ascend the throne. The King is furious: he has the bard tied up and thrown in a ditch.\n\nThe King wants to ensure his kingdom looks clean and beautiful, and reflects prosperity in the eyes of outsiders during the celebration. So he captures all beggars and urchins and keeps them in a fenced, guarded field, out of sight of the visitors.\n\nGoopy and Bagha Join With Udayan\n\nIn the meantime, Goopy and Bagha reach Hirak after travelling to many other places. They come across Udayan, and from him they learn the truth about the King of Hirak. Udayan is thrilled by the magical powers of the musicians, and seeks their aid in his revolt against the King. The duo too decide to join forces with Udayan, and teach a lesson to the tyrannical King. Udayan, as mastermind of the plan, advises Goopy and Bagha how to carry on with the next steps.\n\nAccordingly, the musicians reach the King's court, and pretend to be pleased with him. They even sing a song in praise of the monarch. The King unveils a statue of himself in a field. At their request, the King also takes them for a visit to the diamond mine. There they meet Udayan, who is disguised as a miner. Udayan manages to hand over a letter to Bagha, asking the pair to meet him that night.\n\nCarrying Out the Plan\n\nThe friends meet Udayan as arranged, and as per their plan, go to the king's treasury to loot his diamonds. On the way, they also rescue Charandas. Goopy mesmerises the treasury guard with his song, and Bagha ties him up, takes the key, and they enter the treasury. To their utter surprise, Goopy and Bagha find a tiger guarding the chest of diamonds. They are terrified. But even the tiger is affected by the magic; once again, Goopy starts singing, and the tiger becomes immobile for as long as the song lasts. Bagha makes use of this opportunity to loot the treasury.\n\nThey now reach the scientist's laboratory where the brain-washing machine is kept, and bribe him with a few of the diamonds.\n\nMeanwhile, Udayan is captured by the palace guards, and along with his students is brought to the scientist's laboratory for brain-washing. They are forced into the machine, but to the King's dismay, it does not work. Udayan, along with his loyal students, come out, and Goopy starts singing, accusing the King of all his misdeeds, and revealing his actual nature. Bagha, in the meantime, wins the guards over to his side by giving them diamonds. Udayan now puts the King, along with his council of ministers, inside the machine, where their brains are washed!\n\nAll gather at the field, and the film ends with the citizens - who are later joined by the king and his ministers too, now with their brains 'washed' for good - pulling down the King's statue, shattering it into pieces.\n\nAwards\n\nBest music, director, New Delhi, 1980\n\nBest lyrics, New Delhi, 1980\n\nSpecial award, Cyprus, 1984\n\nGoopy Bagha Phire Elo (The Return of Goopy and Bagha)\n\nStory, lyrics and music: Satyajit Ray\n\nScreenplay and direction: Sandip Ray\n\nCamera: Barun Raha\n\nArt Director: Ashok Bose\n\nCast: Tapen Chatterjee, Robi Ghosh, Ajit Bannerjee (Brahmananda Acharya, the Spiritualist), Haradhan Bannerjee (King of Anandapur)\n\nProducer: Department of Information and Culture, Govt of West Bengal\n\nGoopy Bagha Phire Elo, released in 1992 and directed by Sandip Ray, Satyajit Ray's son, was the last of the trilogy.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe title-song tells us that the Kings of Shundi and Halla are now 88 years old, and have retired to the forest, leaving their thrones to Goopy and Bagha. However, the two musicians have become frustrated and overcome with wanderlust. They decide to go out travelling once again, leaving the responsibilities of administration to their ministers. They have been invited by the King of Anandapur to watch a contest of magicians.\n\nBrahmananda the Spiritualist\n\nThe story starts with the final conversation between Brahmananda, a spiritualist student who has just completed his training, and his preceptor8. Although the teacher is a genuine spiritualist, Brahmananda is dishonest, and makes unfair use of the spiritual powers he has acquired from his preceptor. The preceptor reprimands his disciple for this, and tells him that because he has yet to conquer his lust for wealth, has yet to dispose of the wealth he acquired when he was a bandit in the past, and has yet to receive the punishments he deserves for the crimes he committed as a bandit, he will not be able to attain immortality. A 12-year-old boy called Bikram, in Anandapur, a prosperous town on the banks of the Gahana river, will be the cause of his death.\n\nGoopy and Bagha Meet Brahmananda\n\nGoopy and Bagha attend the court of Anandapur to watch the contest of magicians. Being kings, they do not compete, but at the end they show a few of their tricks, using their magical powers, followed by a song. The only person at the court who was not frozen by the music was Brahmananda, who is now also at Anandapur. He is residing at the Anandagarh fort, along with his guards Domboru and Dunduvi and servant Chumbak. He has taken upon himself the title of Acharya9. He goes on tapping his index finger to the tune of the music.\n\nAwestruck by their magical powers, Brahmananda Acharya invites the pair to the fort to learn about them in detail. When they visit him, they are dumb-struck to know that their magic had no effect on the Acharya. After learning about the musicians' source of magical power, the Acharya shows them his collection of gems. He now tries to persuade them to get him the three most precious gems from the royal turbans of the Kings of Shankhapur, Kanchanpur and Bishalnagar. When they refuse to be his accomplice in his heinous plans, the wily Acharya offers to reduce their age by twenty years each. The Acharya also assures the pair that nobody will recognise them as he'll help them put on a disguise. They ask for time to decide, and leave for their host's palace.\n\nIn the meantime, the Acharya asks Chumbak, his servant, to invite all 12-year-old boys in Anandapur who are called Bikram to the fort. When they come, he hypnotises them all with his spiritual power, and makes them serve him.\n\nAdvice from the King of Ghosts\n\nGoopy and Bagha are in a dilemma. They do not want to help the Acharya in his heinous plans; at the same time, they are not able to ignore the idea of becoming younger by 20 years. They are also thrilled by the idea of going for the theft in disguise. At the same time, Bagha also suspects that the Acharya will hypnotise them before they are sent for the jewels to ensure they do not run away with them. Goopy doubts if they can be hypnotised, as they are blessed with the boons from the King of the Ghosts; but they are still apprehensive. They decide to consult with the King of the Ghosts. They visit the bamboo forest in Notungaon once again, where they had first met 20 years back. The King of Ghosts is delighted to see the pair again, and assures them that they can be hypnotised only if they want to, and never against their will. The King also cautions them against many temptations all around the world; they should not give in to them.\n\nMeanwhile, the parents of all the Bikrams in Anandapur are worried about their sons' whereabouts. Their fathers, led by Pradeep - a teacher - go to the king, and the king seeks the help of Goopy and Bagha. The pair reassure the villagers, urging them not to worry, and say that they will resolve the situation as soon as possible.\n\nGoopy and Bagha decide to abide by the advice of the King of Ghosts, and turn down the Acharya's proposal. They visit the fortress, and to their dismay, find the children clad in black robes serving the Acharya in a state of trance. The pair decide not to spare the vile Acharya, and plan to find a way out. They meet a child, Kanu, with his pet lamb at the banks of the Gahana river. At his request, Goopy sings a song and the viewers are amazed to see that Goopy's song is unable to freeze Kanu who, unnoticed by the duo, goes on tapping his index-finger to the tune of the song. Kanu is an orphan brought up by his grandfather.\n\nThe musicians decide to give in to the Acharya's temptations, in order to find out why the latter has imprisoned the children.\n\nWhen Pradeep visits Kanu's grandfather, Kanu says the fortress is inhabited by a demon who has imprisoned the childen. A shocked Pradeep visits Goopy and Bagha, and they confirm that the children are imprisoned in the fortress. Pradeep urges them to escort him to the fort at night. However, he is shocked when his son is unable to recognise him.\n\nThe King too sends his guards to the fort the next day to rescue the children and to capture the Acharya. The Acharya brings all the children in front of the parents, and none of the Bikrams can recognise their fathers. When the King's guards try to arrest the Acharya, the latter increases his weight by a thousand times using his spiritual powers, and the guards are not even able to move him from the spot! The Acharya tells them that he'll release the boys once they turn 12 years and two months of age.\n\nGoopy and Bagha Play Along\n\nAs suspected, the Acharya attempts to hypnotise Goopy and Bagha. The process has no effect on them, but they pretend to be hypnotised. They go to Shankhopur in disguise, and while the King and his courtiers are enjoying the tricks of acrobats and jugglers, they freeze everybody with their music and run away with the jewel on the King's royal turban. Pleased with possessing the jewel, the Acharya gives them a small jewel each and discloses to them why he has kept the children imprisoned in the fortress, thinking mistakenly that they are in a trance.\n\nWhile the Acharya thinks that they are resting in their room in the Anandagarh fortress, Goopy and Bagha visit the King of Anandapur, assuring him that they are planning an escape, and will take a few days' time before they can rescue the children.\n\nThe next day, the pair go to Kanchanpur to get the second jewel. The King of Kanchanpur is travelling at the time, and the musicians freeze his camel caravan with their music. For security purposes, the king has placed his jewelled crown on the head of his pet leopard. Although they feel jittery, the musicians freeze the leopard too with their music, and take the jewel from the crown.\n\nWhen Goopy and Bagha return to Brahmananda Acharya with the jewel, he is overjoyed. By now, however, he knows that they are not under his spell, as Chumbak had been to their room and found it empty while they were visiting the King of Anandapur. An angry Acharya takes away their magic shoes, and keeps them locked inside their room. He tells the pair that until they get the jewel from Bishalnagar, they will not be released and also warns them that if they dare to run away with it, his spiritual power will destroy them.\n\nEscaping from the Acharya\n\nOur intrepid adventurers, however, buy off Chumbak with one of the jewels the Acharya had given them, when the the servant brings them juices. They escape from the fort, but the drinks were drugged, and they fall asleep under a tree. The King of Ghosts appears to them in their dreams, and reprimands them for deviating from the path of honesty. Goopy and Bagha ask for forgiveness; Goopy does so through a wonderful song and the generous King forgives them.\n\nThe pair now go back to the fortress, and while the Acharya is sleeping, they get hold of their shoes and also the jewels from Shankhapur and Kanchanpur. They go to Pradeep to know if there is any other 12-year-old child named Bikram in Anandapur. Pradeep answers in the negative. The musicians are upset, as only a 12-year-old Bikram from Anandapur can finish Brahmananda off. In the meantime, Kanu's grandfather arrives frantically searching for Kanu. He tells Pradeep and the musicians that Kanu has been talking about a demon in the fortress, and that he was planning to put an end to it. He also tells that Kanu was actually named Bikram after he was born, and that he has turned 12 years of age just the day before. Goopy and Bagha along with Pradeep set off for Anandagarh Fort immediately.\n\nMeanwhile, the Acharya has found out that the pair's shoes are missing. He checks for the jewels, and finds them missing too. To his utter surprise he now finds all his other jewels disappearing one by one. Brahmananda is completely baffled. His preceptor appears, reprimands him for his misdeeds, and tells him that Bikram is on his way to reach him and put an end to his reign of tyranny.\n\nThe Real Bikram\n\nKanu/Bikram enters the hall in the fortress followed by Goopy and Bagha, and Goopy starts singing. Brahmananda is devoid of any super power now, as he is in front of Bikram, and Goopy's song freezes him. A supernatural glow from Bikram's face falls on Brahmananda and the latter, unable to stand the innocent glow of the non-violent Bikram, disintegrates into dust. With the end of Brahmananda, his spell breaks on the other Bikrams. The story ends with Goopy and Bagha returning the jewels to the kings of Shankhapur and Kanchanpur.\n\nAwards\n\nBFJA Awards in 1993\n\nBest art direction: Ashok Bose\n\nBest cinematography: Barun Raha\n\nBest editing: Dulal Dutta\n\nBest lyrics: Satyajit Ray\n\nBest music: Satyajit Ray\n\nBest playback singer (Male): Anup Ghoshal\n\nMost outstanding work of the year: Tapen Chatterjee\n\n1 An Indian drum beaten on both sides.\n\n2 Capital of West Bengal, India.
