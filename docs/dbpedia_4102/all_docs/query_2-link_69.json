        "text": "RBN Web Desk: Pavel, who is making a period film on Nobin Chandra Das, widely considered to be the inventor of the iconic sweet rasogolla, is not making the fourth part of the Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne series. If industry reports are to be believed, Open Tee Bioscope director Anindya Chatterjee will now carry on with the Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne franchise which would have a fresh storyline and a new set of characters, and will be bankrolled by actor-producer Prosenjit Chatterjee.\n\nGoopy Gyne Bagha Byne was a 1969 fantasy adventure film directed by Satyajit Ray. It was the biggest hit of his career. The film was based on a 20-page short story written by his grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Ray later went to make Hirak Rajar Deshe (1980), the sequel to Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, while Ray’s son Sandip made the third film of the series Goopy Bagha Phire Elo (1992). All three film had Tapen Chatterjee and Robi Ghosh in the lead.\n\nSD Burman House in Urgent Need of Repairs\n\nIt may be recalled that Pavel, who made his directorial debut with Babar Naam Gandhiji (2015), registered a story titled Abar Hirak Deshe with The Film Writers Association, Mumbai, in 2016. He had been working on the storyboard all the while. He reportedly narrated the project to Prosenjit and had promised to make the film only for him and no other producer.\n\nBut in a later development, Prosenjit has reportedly asked Anindya to direct the film, who will start working on the project after completing Manojder Adbhut Bari.\n\nIn a Remarkable Act, Kolkata Theatre Fraternity Join Hands\n\nIf everything goes according to plans, the fourth film in the Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne franchise will hit the theatres in 2019, which also marks the golden jubilee year of the first film’s release."
