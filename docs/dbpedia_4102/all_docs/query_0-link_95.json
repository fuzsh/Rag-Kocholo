        "text": "I was probably three when I first watched Hirak Rajar Deshe (In the Land of the Diamond King), a great but less discussed children’s film directed by Satyajit Ray and produced by the Government of West Bengal. It was released in 1980, as a sequel to Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969), the first film of the GooGaBaBa trilogy and a prequel to Goopy Bagha Phire Elo (1992), the last. Among the plethora of children’s films made by Ray, this trilogy particularly stands out for its distinctly political content. The first film is explicitly anti-war, the second anti autocracy, and the third depicts the fall of a greedy and power hungry religious guru. Sounds almost prophetic, doesn’t it? However, watching Hirak Rajar Deshe with the bearings of today’s time in mind makes Ray look like Nostradamus.\n\nGoopy and Bagha are a singer and dholak player duo fictionalized by Ray’s grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Sent to exile from their respective villages for being terrible musicians, they meet at a forest and please the king of ghosts with their music, who then give them three boons. The first and second are to eat and dress as they wish and to travel as they please as long as they clap each other’s hands and have their magic shoes on. The third blessing is the ability to render people motionless with their mesmerizing music. Hirak Rajar Deshe begins with the duo bored with their sedentary lifestyle as crown princes of Shundi and Halla, two fictional kingdoms saved from war by them. In search of new adventures, they set out for Hirak Desh, the diamond kingdom, ready to celebrate its diamond jubilee where Goopy and Bagha are to perform. Before entering Hirak Desh, they chance upon a man living in the hills who warn them of the King’s tyranny, he identifies himself as Udayan, the teacher in exile. After seeing Goopy Bagha’s magical power, he plans to overthrow the king with their help. Upon reaching the Hirak Desh, Goopy and Bagha see the tyranny of the king as warned by the man they met. In Diamond kingdom, the farmers starve even though they grow the food, the miners who mine diamonds, live in utter misery. The ministers are the king’s puppets and any dissenting voice is silenced. Anyone who asks their due or protests against the injustice in the kingdom are jailed and sent to a laboratory run by the king’s pet scientist Gabeshak. In the laboratory, there is a machine for Mogoj Dholai literally translated as brainwashing. Once the dissenters go into the machine, they come out as subservient bhakts, unable to think on their own, and blindly supportive of the king. However, not all in the kingdom are have accepted defeat. Like all autocratic tyrants, this king also has one enemy, the teacher. The teacher, aptly named Udayan (rise) believes in values and teaches them to the children in the kingdom. He calls out the king for his tyranny. As a result of his dissent, the king sends his sepoys to burn his books and shuts down his pathshala. To elude prison, Udayan flees and starts living in exile in the mountains bordering the kingdom. His students eagerly await his return. The king clarifies his problem with the teacher and those he teaches,\n\n“Ora Joto Beshi Pore,\n\nToto Beshi Jaane,\n\nToto Kom Maane”\n\n(The more they read,\n\nthe more they know,\n\nthe less they bow)\n\nThe king also has problem with dissenting artists. In one of the scenes, the sentries of the king bring in an old, feeble troubadour named Charandas. Upon knowing he has been arrested for singing, the king gets amused and asks him to sing. Charandas’ song lays out the details of the king’s unjust rule, and from his sheer intolerance of criticism, orders the sentries to drag Charandas out of the court and throw him in prison. Sounds eerily familiar, doesn’t it?\n\nAnyway, moving on with the story, the duo pretend to love the celebrations and fool the king to rob the royal treasury of precious diamonds to bribe the guards and the scientists. The teacher returns to the village and his students armed with the values he taught stand by him. But the tyrants don’t give up on their tyranny so easily, do they? Hirak Raja captures Udayan and his students and take them to the laboratory to brainwash them in the machine, but alas! The guards and the scientists have already been bribed, and they capture the king and his ministers.\n\nThe king and the ministers are put in the machine. Meanwhile, the villagers, free from the fear, begins pulling down the massive statue of the king, symbolic of the King’s tyrant rule. The chants get louder and louder, as the crowd gets larger. The chorus goes on-\n\n“Dori Dhore Maaro Taan,\n\nRaja Hobe Khan Khan”\n\n(Pull the rope so hard,\n\nThat the King breaks in parts)\n\nThe machine does its work. The King and his ministers come out of it as changed people and join the masses in ending the rule of tyranny.\n\nThis film depicts a dystopian time. It was made shortly after the crackdown on Naxalite movement in Bengal and Emergency. It draws its inspiration from there. Ironically, Hirak Raja is played by none other than Utpal Dutt, a naxal sympathiser, who himself like Charandas in this film, was arrested by the state multiple times for his political plays. Ray shows how under normalized state repression, the youth rebels, the students and teachers and the farmers and the miners emerge as a resistant force they are driven by the values they are taught, of compassion, love, solidarity. Ray also interestingly shows both Hindu and Muslim characters in his depiction of the fictional kingdom. He himself said on the content of his films, as quoted in his biography by Andrew Robinson, “You felt certain changes taking place, almost in day-to-day experience. You felt that without reflecting those changes, you couldn’t make a film.” The eerie similarity with what is happening tells us we too are living in a state of emergency, an undeclared one. If Ray were alive today, he in all likeliness would not have been able to make this film. He would be called “anti-national” or a member of the “Tukde Tukde Gang”, maybe ‘Sickular’, for his values. The man bringing India its first Oscar would be called Deshdrohi for daring to depict truth, or much like Charandas in his film, he would be in jail or Vivek Agnihotri will be dissing him in one of the panel discussions on TV.\n\nThe Hirak Raja of our time has starved the farmers, have killed the miners, have tried to shut our universities and destroy our libraries. He has jailed the voices of dissent, tortured innocent people. With his army of spineless news anchors, he has turned the television into a machine for brainwashing. I think we can safely compare the Media, that is supposed to be the fourth pillar of democracy, safely with the machine for ‘Mogoj Dholai’. The hydra headed monster feeding frenzy to the masses, through spreading misinformation, fueling communal tension, distorting facts while reporting, showing doctored videos, and continuously glorifying a megalomaniac mass murderer, brainwashing the masses into unquestionable bhakti for the tyrant.\n\nBut our students are there, the teachers, the farmers, the miners, the homemakers, the citizens, believing in the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity, of secularism, against capitalism, brahmanism, and communalism promoted by the current regime. The climax urges us to hope for the end of this regime, but the tyrant of our time will not pull the rope to bring himself down. The only rope the tyrant will pull will be to strangle democracy, much as he already is. The people will end his tyranny, and unlike Ray’s vision, in our case, the masses will not be of only men. The masses bringing down the tyrant of our time have women in the lead, women are pulling the first ropes. The tyrant will fall with his regime. The people are giving ultimatums already,\n\n“Anachaar koro jodi, raja tobe chharo godi,\n\nJara taar dhamadhari, taader o bipod bhaari,\n\nGoriber shoshon paap, khoma cheye nahin maaf”\n\n(If you are a tyrant, you have to leave the throne,\n\nWhoever supports tyranny, also will face consequences,\n\nTo exploit the poor is a sin, and apologies won’t save you)\n\nThe tyrant is listening, and the tyrant is shivering. The tyrant today had to take boats and helicopters to flee. The tyrant knows his time is coming to an end."
