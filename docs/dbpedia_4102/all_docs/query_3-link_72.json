        "text": "LINK\n\n[Tapan Chatterjee on the right]\n\nGoopy Gyne, Satyajit Ray’s magic minstrel who sang himself into the souls of every Bengali and taught him to appreciate the beauty of the world with wideeyed wonder, is no more. Tapen Chatterjee, 72, takes with him a piece of everyone’s heart — because with him goes a chunk of our childhood seeped in nostalgia. As FM channels played ‘Dekho Re Nayan Mele Jagat er Bahar’ or ‘Aha Ki Anando Akashe Batashe’ through the day, children of the 60s, 70s and even 80s wept.\n\nIt was Tapen who made Goopy’s character immortal, or was it the other way round? As fans would say, it’s impossible to separate them. Tapen’s was Goopy’s face as Rabi Ghosh’s was Bagha Byne’s . But unlike the latter, who had acted in many other films, Tapen had become Goopy personified, for everyone who lives and swears by Ray’s ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ and ‘Hirak Rajar Deshe’ and then Sandip Ray’s ‘Goopy Bagha Phire Elo’ .\n\nThat ear-to-ear smile and the songs of innocence and happiness, of freedom and justice that he lipped effortlessly, lent immortality to the character and story created by Satyajit Ray’s grandfather Upendra Kishore Ray Chowdhury and later filmed by Ray. When Rabi Ghosh died in 1997, Bagha Byne the drummer was gone forever, but we still held on to Goopy and thought not all was finished.\n\nWhat we perhaps didn’t know was that Tapen was ailing for a long time. He had a lung disorder even when he was acting in ‘GooGa BaBa’ , which released in 1968. This never left him. “He would be short of breath on the sets. But he was such a fine actor that he would camouflage the discomfort,” remembers Sandip Ray, who was often present on the sets of ‘GooGa BaBa’ and ‘Hirak Rajar Deshe’ .\n\nTapen never knew he would end up acting in films. An advertising professional with a newspaper , he was a family friend of the Rays, who helped out with the Sandesh magazine at times. But Ray felt that Tapen might fit into the shoes of Goopy and shortlisted him. “Better-known actors had come for the audition, but it was Tapen who clinched the role. He proved his mettle from the very first day. It was not easy to act in the same frame with Rabi Ghosh, who was an established actor by then. But Tapen did that step for step,” Sandip recalls.\n\nThe toughest bit was perhaps matching lips with the mellifluous songs by Anup Ghoshal sung for Goopy. “Tapen was a completely non-musical person and was petrified of this bit. So he practiced and practiced till he perfected the art of lipping songs,” Sandip says.\n\nThis fact is corroborated by Soumendu Ray, the cameraman of not only the Goopy trilogy but many of Ray’s films. “Tapen took shooting extremely seriously. He was never late and would meticulously do his homework that Ray would lay down for him. The results were there for everyone to see. To play a simpleton’s character like Goopy’s — often bordering on idiocy — was not easy, even with Ray’s help,” Soumendu says.\n\nNemai Ghosh, the photographer of many of Ray’s films, remembers that the first time he clicked a photograph on Ray’s sets was a shot Tapen as Goopy and that remained a permanent joke between the two. “When I received my Padmashree, Tapen called to remind me that he was my first subject !” remembers Ghosh, one of Tapen’s closest friends.\n\nTapen did not act in too many films. He played a cameo in Ray’s ‘Mahanagar’ before ‘GooGa BaBa’ . His other better-known roles were in ‘Dhanyi Meye’ and ‘Sangini’ .\n\nHis lung disorder had worsened in recent times and he had to be hospitalised often, says son Suvobrata , an advertising professional. After having his morning tea on Monday , Tapen suffered a fatal heart attack and died even before he could be rushed to hospital. He is survived by wife Alo and two sons.\n\nChief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s office got in touch with the family. It was decided that Tapen’s body would be kept at Nandan for most of Tuesday for people to bid farewell to their favourite Goopy, now that God has finally granted him the magic shoes to take his spirit where ever it wishes to go."
