        "text": "What if Robert Langdon was shown Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne ? Interesting prospect which would surely have kept Dan Brown’s creation busy for weeks as the film considered to be an adventurous fantasy movie made for children from a story written by Satyajit Ray’s grandfather Upendrakishore Roychowdhury is a treasure trove of cryptic communications on regional politics,socio-political ideologies and humanism.\n\nRay’s one of the most commercially successful movies released in 1968 is a duality: on one hand it narrates a children's fantasy chronicling the inanity of animosity and on the other hand it is layered with metaphorical communications through imageries on serious ideologies and socio-political realism. As Ben Nyce in the book Satyajit Ray : A Study of His Films writes, the film functions both as a serious commentary and pure fantasy.\n\nIn this article incapacitated by the availability of either Robert Langdon or our very own Feluda, let us proceed to decipher the metaphorical messages communicated by Ray in the movie.\n\nTo begin with, Ray is often branded as an apolitical filmmaker in comparison to his counterparts Mrinal Sen and Rittick Ghatak, as their movies were supposedly more overt and assertive in reflecting political and social realism.Ray, in comparison, made cinematic creations which transcends the temporality to be an eternal study of humanism and emancipates his viewers and grant them freedom to interpret and understand his works with their own free conscience.\n\nGoopy Gyne Bagha Byne(GGBB) released in 1968, thus hints on the auteur’s understanding and viewpoints on regional politics post the Pakistan insurgency of India in 1965. In the film we find two neighbouring states who are essentially similar are parted. The essence of similarity between the two regions is communicated by Ray in using twin representation for the sovereign of the States. Actor Santosh Dutta, plays dual roles in the form of Halla Raja and Shundi Maharaja in the movie. Ray wanted to communicate that India and Pakistan though divided essentially shares the oneness which is at the crux of their sovereignty.\n\nSimilarly, usage of the names of the two regions as Halla and Shundi also seems to give indicative implications on regional power politics. Though in today’s trying time when India’s secularism is tested to the hilt, it is my personal opinion (without hurting the growing over sensitive sensationalism regarding religiousness in India today ), through using the names Halla and Shundi , Ray perhaps wanted to connote the religions in prominence in India and Pakistan.\n\nIn the movie it is shown that Shundi is a peace embracing country with abundance and but with one hindrance of the populace who do not have the power to speak. The despondency shown by the King of Shundi regarding the silence of the populace clearly reflects Ray’s ideology towards freedom of speech,dialogue and communication. Through which Ray probably wanted to communicate that no sovereign can be truly happy however plentiful resources and facilities they may possess unless they have the power to vocally communicate their feelings. It is the duty of the sovereign to ensure the freedom of communication and information is accorded to all.\n\nContrastingly, in Halla it is shown that the common persons have to live in oppression which is showcased as being endorsed and enforced by the sovereign but in reality is controlled by the Senapati ( Army Head - Played by Johor Roy) who with his accomplice Barfi ( magician conjurer ) exploits the common mass and drugs the otherwise naturally peaceful sovereign to turn violent and aggressive.\n\nInterestingly, similar power-political realism is characteristic of our neighboring country, where even today, the common people do not harbour hatred and animosity towards India. It is often noted through different articles and political commentaries how the country cultivates terrorism and aggression towards India through the close collaboration between their army and the religious fanatic groups. Instead of catering to the basic needs of hygiene, health and hunger the country fans hatred and hostility towards India. Interestingly, Ray throughout the movie depicts Barfi wearing a long gown-like dress much akin to the dress ‘Alkhalla’ which are mostly worn by clerics of a particular religion. Ray perhaps wanted to communicate the influence and instigation of these clergies in insinuating war.\n\nRay’s humanism is reflected as he indicatively reflects the true sovereign to be peace-loving and being a puppet in the hands of power thirsty warmongering influential . Ray’s ideology on power politics is true in today’s world as well. The common populace of any country who are the soul of sovereignty of the country are essentially peace loving. It is only through external influences of motivated hegemonization that they turn aggressive and violent towards others in the civil-society.\n\nThe film not only narrates the story of a fantasy adventure to stop warfare but also educates us on the concept of Freedom and Fraternity. The central protagonists of the movie Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne are initially shown as tormented for their inclination to pursue skills which they love but are not equipped to master. The aristocrats of the village found it an opportunity to ridicule and banish them out of their respective villages of Hortoki and Amloki. Ray through the ordeal of the central protagonist Goopy Gyne( Casted by Tapen Chattopadhyay) and Bagha Byne ( Rabi Ghosh) gave us a glimpse of the injustices and social ostracism being practiced in civil societies towards anyone who wants to go beyond the set pattern of societal class and caste bounded functions to follow their own passion.\n\nIn GGBB and Hirak Rajar Deshe, Ray professes his ideologies on politics of change, power conflict and self ; but they do not scream at us to follow and notice his viewpoints but are subtly embroidered within the greater narrative of the film not disturbing the texture and fervour of the narrative.Thus in the Six and half minute dance sequence before the boons are favoured to Goopy and Bagha by The Bhooter Raja (the Ghost King), we see through the translucent slides Ray’s creativeness in presenting his viewpoints on Indian Social Caste and Class system and the colonial and post colonial influences on the same.Each is shown to be at ease and comfortable on their own unless they clamor for overall supremacy over others leading to infighting and collapse of the civil society. An inverted social order is shown in the dance sequence with the peasants reflecting on top followed by others\n\nEven the Boons granted by the Ghost king are in direct correlation to the freedoms guaranteed at least judicially to us as Indian Citizens. Through the boons Goopy and Bagha were bestowed with the freedom from Hunger, Movement, Livelihood , Communication. The Indian constitution also guarantees these as our basic fundamental rights.\n\nIndian Constitution guarantees us the Right to freedom which includes freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association or union or cooperatives, movement, residence, and right to practice any profession or occupation. Ray used the movie to highlight the power and impact of the rights we enjoy as free citizens of India. In the movie we see that out of these boons or rather freedoms that were bestowed by Bhooter Raja one comes with additional protection, that is the Freedom of speech and expression, when Goopy and Bagha express their skills and views others will be stoned, so that they will not have the power to forcibly stop them from expressing. It is so true even today, freedom of expression is only meaningful if one's views are not curbed by the shouts of others, one is free to express her views free from the worry of being suppressed, monitored or tutored to sing in sync dictated and indicated by any external person, group or any organisation. Unless such a guarantee is entitled freedom of speech and expression do not have any prevailing essence.\n\nThe iconic scene in GGBB where army men of Halla going at war with Shundi are shown skeltering towards the sweetmeats raining from sky to meet their long unappeased hunger clearly disseminates the ideology of Ray. Food and livelihood are the basic necessity of a starving and deprived populace, they are propelled and forced by state machineries and conning power mongers to go to war and sacrifice their lives in the name of ‘jihad’ or any motivated ideologies irrespective of country, religions and timelines . Given a chance and opportunity to meet their basic need for food and livelihood they always seek to maintain peace and harmony with all. The mise-en-scene was also a scene of emancipation for Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne as they use their magical boons not for their own livelihood but to provide food and life to the starving mass resulting in freedom not only for them but also for the sovereign ruler, who gets awakened from his dozed state of drugged dependency and runs out from the bondage with regained consciousness of happiness and freedom.\n\nComparatively, in Hirak Rajar Deshe a sequel to GGBB we find the central protagonists save a state from the clutches of totalitarian power who usurped and exploited the common people by forcefully maintaining an uniformity of opinion through use of state crafted technology. Ray through the narrative dawn upon us the concept of hegemony as opined by French philosopher Louis Althusser, a philosophy which believes that it is the ruling class who manipulates the culture of the society by imposing their beliefs,viewpoints,mores and perceptions as the dominant ideology and way of life for its civil society. Similarly , in Hirak Rajar Deshe, anyone having any confrontational viewpoint to that of the State or its Ruler , the individual’s opinions and beliefs are doctored. Doctrines and beliefs are tutored through Jantar Mantar (A Brainwash Machinery owned by the State).\n\nReleased in 1980 to many, it was Ray’s covert protest against the National Emergency of India in 1978 during the Indira Gandhi rule. But on careful observation we may understand the movie is not to be limited to the perpetuity of socio-political recency in which it was crafted, but it comprises ideologies which transcends time and is true in any society which is facing oppression through state machinery. Modernity, as philosopher Hannah Arendt looks at it, is an increasing trend towards compelling individuals towards an uniform conformity. Such conformity is often visioned by governing bodies to embark on greater discipline from divergent demographics. Hence, as in Hirak Rajar Deshe , authorities look for manners through which they can imbibe homogeneity and conformity en masse to save themselves from countering any form of pluralism which might be detrimental to governance.\n\nThe scene of the Hirok Raja(king) pulling down his own statue is perhaps the most overtly political scene showcased by Ray to communicate his political ideologies. The scene is a celebration of liberation and freedom from autocratic dominance and will remain an iconic representation of freedom from political despotism and dominance. Interestingly in the last scene we see the corrupt sovereign who is shown to be transformed through his own state machinery ‘Jantar Mantar’ and joins hand with working classes in bringing down his own reign of terror and oppression. Symbolically meaning that it is even possible to transform the despots and make them a part of the democracy. Each of the working classes are shown to hold separate strands to pull the symbol of their oppressive figurehead collectively indicating peaceful social revolution to bring about social transformation.\n\nLike Barfi in GGBB , in Hirak Rajar Deshe we find Gabeshak (Scientist) to be the accomplice of the despot in creating the Jantar Mantar , the machine made and operated to tutor the conscience and understanding of others in accordance to the wish and purpose of the Sovereign. An analogy which indicates the trauma of the modern civil-society where science and technology are used not for humanitarian purposes, but to carry out motivated management of the greater mass to be in-tune with the desires and wishes of the State. A true reflection of today's life where both our aspirations and apprehensions are designed and painted not by us but by carefully organised state machinery using digital technologies.\n\nIt was only the genius of Ray to intricately imbibe these serious philosophies and his own ideologies of humanism in the narrative of the movies which were crafted essentially for the children. His works will remain immortal as they give new myriad hues as one studies them closely and the works will remain contemporary in appeal through each passing decade."
