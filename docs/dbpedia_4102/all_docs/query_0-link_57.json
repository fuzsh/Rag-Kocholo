        "text": "The iconic Priya Cinema on Rashbehari Avenue of South Kolkata, which was shut in August 2018 after a fire broke out on the premises, will reopen today. The landmark single-screen theatre will screen Satyajit Ray’s cult classic, Goopy Gyne Bhagha Byne, at 7 pm today.\n\nArijit Dutta, Managing Director of Priya Entertainment Pvt Ltd, tweeted:\n\nHe also said, “…we will have a special screening of Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne in the original black and white 35 mm print. We have particularly selected this movie for the screening as I feel that it is the most iconic Bengali movie ever made, which is of concern to the general public nationally as well as internationally.”\n\nGoopy Gyne Bhagha Byne (1969) is a fantasy adventure comedy film written and directed by Satyajit Ray. It is based on a story by his grandfather Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury. The film revolves around the characters of Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne who made their first appearance in the famous Sandesh magazine in 1915. The music of the film was done by Ray himself. This was the first film of the Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne series, followed by a couple of sequels- Hirak rajar Deshe, which was released in 1980 and Goopy Bhaga Phire Elo, written by Ray but directed by his son Sandip Ray in 1992.\n\nCelebrities like Prosenjit Chatterjee, Kaushik Ganguly, Arindam Sil, Gautum Ghosh and Abir Chatterjee among others will attend the special screening today. Cinephiles across the city will also attend the screening as some passes were handed out free of cost.\n\nKaushik Ganguly tweeted:\n\nThe theatre has been renovated with state-of-the-art seating arrangements and fire safety equipment. It will screen Kaushik Ganguly’s Nagarkirtan, Total Dhammal and Gully Boy from Friday."
