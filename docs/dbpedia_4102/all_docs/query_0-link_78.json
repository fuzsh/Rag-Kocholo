Bagha (Maneesh Bhawan), is a drummer who too is besura as hell and is expelled out from his village because of that. They meet by chance in a forest and to keep fear at bay, start singing and drumming. The cacophony they create much amuses the ghosts in the forest and pleased by them, the king of the ghosts grants them four boons. They ask that their music should transfix people, they should get good things to eat at will and also the ability to travel wherever they want. The fourth wish they keep in reserve. They travel to the kingdoms of Shundi and Hundi, ruled by twin brothers at loggerheads with each other, The avert the impending war, unite the brothers, and get married to their daughters in the bargain.\n\nGoopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969) is a fantasy musical directed by Satyajit Ray, based on a story by his grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. It had the music and lyrics written by Ray himself. Director Shilpa Ranade has kept the essence of the classic intact, converting the live action film into an animated musical. The music by 3 Brothers and a Violin adds to the film. Apart from the voice artistes, who have done a commendable job, the singers involved in the project too should be lauded as they have turned the songs into real earworms with their rendition.\n\nThe film gives an anti-war message, so relevant to our current times. The animation is inspired from the Bengali film art form, Patachitra and is colourful, vibrant and detailed. Each frame feels like a miniature painting. If you pay close attention you get to see more and more detail. Each character is different from each other. We've been accustomed to seeing Disney inspired drawings and animation and it's a pleasure to see something indigenous being used so brilliantly. Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne turned quite popular and Ray turned it into a trilogy, making two more films, Hirak Rajar Deshe and Goopi Bagha Phire Elo, which continued the adventures of Goopi and Bagha. It would be a good idea if the makers of the present film too followed suit.\n\nTRAILER : GGBB: Goopi Gawaiya Bagha Bajaiya"
