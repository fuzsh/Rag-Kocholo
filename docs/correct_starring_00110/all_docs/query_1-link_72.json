S., filmography in Premiere (New York), October 1993.\n\n* * *\n\nBarbara Hershey is a generally fine actress who, too often, has been wasted in films not worthy of her talents. Her critical reputation was resuscitated in the late 1980s when she accomplished the feat of winning back-to-back Best Actress prizes at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHershey was a gifted drama student at Hollywood High School when she obtained a talent agent through a teacher. The good-looking 17-year-old brunette quickly found regular work on the television series The Monroes , and later in other small-screen shows before making her big-screen debut as Brian Keith's possessive daughter in the Doris Day comedy With Six You Get Eggroll .\n\nIn 1969, Hershey played the first important lead of her career as Sandy in Last Summer , Frank Perry's artful and controversial study of four upper-class teenagers idling away a summer in a beach community. Here, Hershey was cast as a vivacious, willful beauty who manipulates her two male friends and taunts a plain-looking, less sexually experienced female. Observed the Variety critic, \"Barbara Hershey has the sexual provocativeness and hoydenishness that is not calmed by any perceptive maturity.\"\n\nAnother significant early role for Hershey came in Martin Scorsese's first studio production, Boxcar Bertha . In this low-budget drama about the Great Depression, shot in 24 days in Arkansas, she appears in the title role, an orphaned vagrant who hops one freight train after another with her derelict lover, an embittered ex-labor agitator (David Carradine) and his band of train robbers. In retrospect, given the director with whom she was working, Hershey's presence becomes notable and even historic, but at the time of its release the movie was criticized as being excessively violent and was not a success.\n\nIn the 1970s, when Hershey was an attractive young actress who should have been peaking in popularity, her marketability was limited. This was partly because she had acquired a reputation as a hippie, which, in the eyes of many industry powers and moviegoers, meant she was flaky. Hershey was a flower-child, living out-of-wedlock with David Carradine and naming their baby boy \"Free.\" She had changed her own name to Barbara Seagull sometime after the making of Last Summer , during which she accidentally was involved in the killing of a seagull. Furthermore, she put off audiences by taking roles considered outrageous. For instance, in The Baby Maker , Hershey played a nonconformist hired to be impregnated by a man whose wife was sterile. And so, for the rest of the decade, she appeared mainly in minor and forgettable projects.\n\nThen in 1980, director Richard Rush chose her for the outstanding black comedy The Stunt Man . This bit of casting took Hershey out of the second-rate ingenue roles to which she had been relegated, and placed her in her first womanly part. She played a quirky motion picture actress who appears to give her heart to a fugitive Vietnam veteran hiding on a set, when she actually is having an affair with the film's egomaniacal director (Peter O'Toole). The Stunt Man received critical accolades, and has become something of a cult film. Hershey's performance may have been passed over or panned by the reviewers, but it nonetheless pulled her out of a casting rut.\n\nTwo years later began a string of interesting roles in significant films by leading directors. In The Right Stuff , she is the wife of astronaut Chuck Yeager; in The Natural , she is the personification of evil, an erotic mystery woman who comes on to baseball phenom Roy Hobbs, then shoots him and commits suicide. Her dark sexual appeal was exploited further in Hannah and Her Sisters , in which she plays the pivotal part of Lee, the girlfriend of a moody artist, who becomes the love object of her brother-in-law; and again in the black comedy Tin Men , where she appears as the wife of an aluminum siding salesman who is seduced by her husband's arch enemy. During the making of Boxcar Bertha , Hershey gave Martin Scorsese the idea of filming Nikos Kazantzakis's controversial novel The Last Temptation of Christ . When he made the film 16 years later, the filmmaker handed her the coveted role of Mary Magdalene. But for many fans of three-handkerchief weepies, Hershey's most dynamic role came playing opposite Bette Midler in the quintessential woman's film Beaches .\n\nThe apex of three decades of filmic output came for Hershey when she was awarded the Best Actress Prize at Cannes two consecutive years. In 1987 she earned the award for Shy People , playing the head of a backwoods bayou clan. The following year, she was recognized for a riveting performance as a political zealot dedicated to the abolishment of apartheid in South Africa in A World Apart .\n\nHershey's more notable recent roles have been as characters who are secondary to the film's primary focus: Michael Douglas's estranged wife in Falling Down ; a mystery woman opposite Joe Pesci in The Public Eye ; and Debra Winger's sister in A Dangerous Woman ."
