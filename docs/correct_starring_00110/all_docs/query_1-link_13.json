        "text": "Actor Willem Dafoe on Branching Out Beyond the Bad Guy\n\nDafoe was once pigeonholed as a villain, but he's since earned a wide variety of film roles. He's starred in \"Platoon,\" \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" \"Mississippi Burning,\" and \"Wild at Heart.\" He's currently starring in the new Paul Schrader film, \"Light Sleeper,\" along with Susan Sarandon.\n\nInterview\n\nWillem Dafoe\n\nNew Yorker Film Critic Says, \"Good Movies Never Make You Feel Virtuous\"\n\nEvery three years or so, a collection of Pauline Kael's movie reviews are collected into a book. Her forthcoming anthology is called Hooked. Kael believes film once served as a kind of common culture, and bemoans the fragmentation of movie audiences. She joins Fresh Air to talk about the state of the film industry and the changing tastes and expectations of audiences.\n\nInterview\n\nPauline Kael\n\nProduction Designer John Beard\n\nBeard lives in London, and still hasn't seen The Last Temptation of Christ, which he worked on with director Martin Scorsese. He join Fresh Air to talk about his decision to shoot the film in Morocco, and the history and traditions informing his design choices. His previous films include Brazil and Life of Brian.\n\nInterview\n\nJohn Beard\n\nAlexandra Auder's mother, Viva, was one of Andy Warhol's muses. Growing up in Warhol's orbit meant Auder's childhood was an unusual one. For several years, Viva, Auder and Auder's younger half-sister, Gaby Hoffmann, lived in the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan. It was was famous for having been home to Leonard Cohen, Dylan Thomas, Virgil Thomson, and Bob Dylan, among others.\n\nIn the series Jury Duty, a solar contractor named Ronald Gladden has agreed to participate in what he believes is a documentary about the experience of being a juror--but what Ronald doesn't know is that the whole thing is fake."
