Quite an impressive feat!\n\n1987: Shy People\n\n1988: A World Apart (with Jodhi May and Linda Mvusi ex aequo)\n\nWhat makes these wins even more special is that the performances couldn't be more different, yet they're equally strong. She plays a paranoid bayou matriarch in one and a crusading activist in apartheid-era South Africa in the other. She really had the makings of a Streep-esque chameleon in the 80s, but unfortunately never quite ascended despite working steadily since the 60s.\n\nWhat do you think of these performances? Should Oscar have followed suit? Please, share your thoughts!\n\nPost by taranofprydain on\n\nTyler, as it so happens, you were the one who recommended the films to me to see in late 2015, and I did view both. A World Apart is the stronger film, but Shy People has the better Hershey performance. She is wonderful in both though.\n\nPost by scottydoesnotknow on\n\nAs I was only a kid in the 1990s, I want to ask. Why wasn't her career bigger? It seemed to have died off in the 1990s with that one totally deserved Oscar nomination for Portrait of a Lady. I started researching her work after seeing Black Swan.\n\nPost by taranofprydain on\n\nAs I was only a kid in the 1990s, I want to ask. Why wasn't her career bigger?

I was only born in 1995, so, anyway..... The best I can reason is this. A lot of actresses had relatively decent careers in the 80s. Hershey came into her own then. Her film career had been quiet through much of the later part of the 70s. And then in the 80s, she was getting a lot of praised parts and big films too. But something started to snap in 1989. at that time, roles for actresses became fewer, and the films that offered roles to them often floundered at the box office. The early 90s were a terrible time for them as not just Hershey suffered, but also Glenn Close, Jessica Lange (despite the Oscar in 1994), Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Sigourney Weaver, Debra Winger, even Meryl Streep. To this day, its still mystifying.\n\nPost by avnermoriarti on\n\nI'm curious in watching the films, recently I saw a few films where she's part of the ensamble, even lead ( she is superb in The Entity ) that changed my perspective on her, because I used to find her quite insuferable. but she can be quite brillant."
