        "text": "Introduced by retired astronaut Colonel Terry Virts\n\nBased on the bestseller by Tom Wolfe, this Oscar-winning epic is about the race to put the first man on the moon. Four U.S. Air Force test pilots (Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Sam Shepard) are chosen as the bravest, the best, and the most daring—the men with “the right stuff.” Terry Virts says this film—a “Movies Houstonians Love” presentation—inspired him to become an astronaut.\n\nAbout the Presenter\n\nTerry Virts served as a U.S. Air Force test-fighter pilot and is a NASA veteran of two space flights. His seven months in space included piloting the Space Shuttle, commanding the International Space Station, and three space walks. While in space he took more than 300,000 photos—more than taken on any other space mission.\n\nGenerous support has been provided by the Foundation for Independent Media Arts.\n\nUnderwriting for the Film Department is provided by Tenaris, The June Leaf and Robert Frank Foundation, and the Vaughn Foundation.\n\nGenerous funding is provided by The Consulate General of the Republic of Korea; Nina and Michael Zilkha; Lois Chiles; Foundation for Independent Media Arts; Franci Neely; Carrin Patman and Jim Derrick; Ms. Laurence Unger; L'Alliance Française de Houston; and ILEX Foundation."
