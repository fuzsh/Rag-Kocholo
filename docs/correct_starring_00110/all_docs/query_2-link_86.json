        "text": "Over the course of a year, actor Eric Ladin portrayed two legendary NASA flight directors. First he played Gene Kranz in “For All Mankind,” an alternate history TV show last year. In the new “The Right Stuff” he steps into the shoes of Christopher Kraft, who played an immeasurable role in building the country’s space program.\n\nIn addition to the opportunity to play two NASA icons, Ladin has found the parts to be a time saver as his scenes almost entirely consist of him in a white, button down shirt.\n\n“My wardrobe fittings are always the quickest,” he says, laughing. “Which is a positive. The other guys, they have outside scenes with other things to wear. Not me. But it’s also a uniform. A daily uniform. It underscores the idea that fashion wasn’t something at the forefront if you were working in Mission Control. They had other things to think about.”\n\n“The Right Stuff” is an interesting new creation: An eight-episode series that begins streaming Oct. 9 on Disney+, it’s based on a 1983 film that was based on Tom Wolfe’s 1979 book about the Mercury program and the birth of the United States’ space program.\n\nPhilip Kaufman’s film has held up well nearly 40 years later. Still the series created by Mark Lafferty justifies its space by finding its own voice in telling this story. The heroic attributes of the Mercury Seven astronauts remain in tact, but the lionization is countered with aspects of their lives kept from the public when LIFE magazine exclusively reported on them. TV’s “The Right Stuff” also makes more room for guys like Kraft and Glynn Lunney, who didn’t perch atop thousands of pounds of rocket fuel, but rather held the lives of those who did in their hands.\n\nSo Kraft — and Ladin’s portrayal of Kraft — project a tunnel vision commitment to the task of getting men from Earth into space and then back again.\n\n“He wasn’t a gentle man,” Ladin says. “I hope there will be future seasons where we can see him at home, a different side of him. But when he went to work, he did just that: buttoned his shirt, tightened his tie and committed to avoiding failures. He knew a mistake meant people could die. And that weighed heavily on him.”\n\n‘Generation Kill’ big break\n\nLadin, 42, makes a bracing first impression in the film, his Craft dressing down Lunney by inquiring if he has goat excrement in his ear.\n\n“I read that line, closed the script, called my manager and said I’d do it,” Ladin says. “Having just come off a period space show (‘For All Mankind’), I wanted to be diligent to not repeat the same subject matter or characters. But the story and script were too intriguing to let it pass me by.”\n\nLadin has over 20 years continued to find roles that speak to him in film and TV. In the early 2000s, he worked several one-episode jobs, but gradually characters with longer arcs came his way. He rose to the occasion when a big break presented itself in 2008 with the role of Corporal James Chaffin in “Generation Kill.” His role as a campaign manager in “The Killing” ran 26 episodes in 2011 and 2012. Ladin also drew strong notices for playing J. Edgar Hoover in six episodes of “Boardwalk Empire.”\n\nHe traces his work back to the Kinkaid School in Houston, where he began to develop a focused interest in acting in middle school. By high school he says “I’d made it a priority,” leading him to the University of Southern California.\n\nHe recalls an anxious dinner with his parents, visiting Los Angeles from Houston, where he clearly stated his path.\n\n“To my surprise, they did not hesitate to tell me how wonderful that was,” he says. “They couldn’t have been more supportive. So I never looked back.”\n\nAstros fan\n\nDespite having spent more than half his life in Los Angeles, Ladin — an ardent baseball enthusiast — continues to wear orange around his adopted city. “I not only wear my Astros hat everywhere,” he says, “I wear the bright orange one. I coach a Little League team here, and I wear the bright orange hat. The other dads are like, ‘Oh, I see how it is . . .’”\n\nThough Ladin grew up in Houston, he says his first real awareness of the region’s connection to space exploration was the Challenger tragedy, which happened when he was eight.\n\nSchool field trips piqued his interest in NASA, which he carried into adulthood. Admittedly, the NASA and Mission Control presented in “The Right Stuff” predates its move to Houston. The Mercury program ran from 1958 through 1963. Mission Control would settle into Texas a couple of years later. But the careers of Kranz and Kraft, who died last year at 95, are still inextricably tied to Houston.\n\nAnd Ladin has time and again shown himself deft at playing tightly coiled springs of characters capable of a nasty snap. He effortlessly does so with Kraft, whose drive is informed also by longing: Kraft badly burned his hand as a child, which kept him from flying. So he found an adjacent line of work also imbued with high stakes.\n\n“He held himself as accountable as everybody who worked for him, and that’s not a trait you come by much these days,” Ladin says. “After a test simulation, he’d make everybody answer for their mistakes. And he’d answer for his own. He turned out to be the right person for the right job at the right time.”\n\nandrew.dansby@chron.com"
