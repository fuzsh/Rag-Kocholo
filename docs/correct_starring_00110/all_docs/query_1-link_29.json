        "text": "Born and raised in a small bungalow in Hollywood, Barbara had dreams of being in movies as a little girl. Quiet and withdrawn, she acted out stories in her back yard. Her major acting debut was on 'The Monroes (1966) (TV)' where she played Kathy. Her motion picture career stated with With Six You Get Eggroll (1968). For the next few years, she was typecast as the wild one and tried to live up to that image. She had a rocky relationship with Actor David Carradine and had a child which she named Free. From 1972 to 1974, she changed her name from Barbara Hershey to Barbara Seagull. Her career was resurrected in 1979 when she appeared in 'From Here to Eternity (1979) (mini) (TV)' and in Stunt Man, The (1980). In that movie, she played an actress on the edge, which may have been influenced by her own life. Based upon her strong performance, other roles followed in such movies as Right Stuff, The (1983); Natural, The (1984); Hoosiers (1986) and 'Beaches (1988)'. A two time winner of the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award for her work in 'Shy People (1987)' and 'A World Apart (1988)', she also won an Emmy for her performance in 'A Killing in a Small Town (1990) (TV)'. Since that time she has continued to act in Television and in Motion Pictures."
