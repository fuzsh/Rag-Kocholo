        "text": "July 25, 2020\n\nâ€” A missing piece of mail almost derails Alan Shepard's future in a first look scene from the pilot episode of \"The Right Stuff.\"\n\nReleased on Saturday (July 25) as part of a San Diego Comic-Con@Home virtual panel with the cast and crew of the upcoming National Geographic scripted series, the clip was set up by actor Jake McDorman, who portrays the real-life astronaut who became the first American to launch off of Earth.\n\n\"He almost didn't get his letter to go to space, which is a true story,\" McDorman said. \"Shepard started to hear that people around him were getting summoned to Langley [Research Center] and he wasn't included, and that was simply because his letter got lost.\"\n\n\"So he got it about a day late and, uh, freaked out,\" McDorman said.\n\nThe humorous scene dramatizes the actual events that kicked off Shepard and six other test pilots being selected by NASA to become the first U.S. astronauts in 1959. \"The Right Stuff\" follows the journeys of the \"Original 7,\" as was chronicled by Tom Wolfe in his 1979 book by the same title.\n\n\"So you've got these perspectives from all these different astronauts on what the 'right stuff' is and the one common thread, as best as I could put together, is it's this relationship with fear,\" said McDorman. \"Fear is something that is such a constant and such a familiar kind of reaction that these people faced day in, day out for years on end, that it is the ability to think clearly, think rigidly, think logically through experiencing feelings that would send 98 percent of people into a panic, and do it anyway.\"\n\nOfficial clip: \"The Right Stuff.\" Click to enlarge video in a new, pop-up window.
