Executive summary: Boxcar Bertha and Mary Magdalene

Born and raised in Hollywood, Hershey took drama classes at Hollywood High. At 17, she landed a recurring role on TV's Gidget, starring Sally Field. By the next season, she was in her own quickly-cancelled series, The Monroes, playing one of five orphans in the old west. Hershey's first starring role was as Martin Scorsese's Boxcar Bertha in 1972. During filming, she loaned Scorsese her copy of the novel, The Last Temptation of Christ. More than a decade later he directed a film adaptation of the book, with Hershey as Mary Magdalene. Instead of offering a pious Charlton Heston-esque presentation, the film portrayed Jesus as a man with human characteristics and weaknesses, making it fantastically controversial among Christian fundamentalists. Hershey was peppered with death threats for months after the movie was released.

In the mid-1970s, she called herself Barbara Seagull (in memory of a bird she accidentally ran over in her car), and was typecast as a hippie, stoner, or wacky chick. Her better-known films include Beaches with Bette Midler, The Natural with Robert Redford, Hoosiers with Gene Hackman, and Hannah and Her Sisters with Woody Allen. More recently, she has done fine work in a long list of quirky, interesting movies -- The Stunt Man, Shy People, A World Apart, Jane Campion's Portrait of a Lady, Lantana, and Merchant-Ivory's underappreciated A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.
