        "text": "It has been recently claimed that the orthodox reconstruction of two affricate segments for Proto-Tupi-Guarani (PTG) is untenable because the relevant reflexes are too chaotic. Under this view, PTG is best reconstructed with a single affricate segment, the multiplicity of correspondence patterns being explained as the result of later dialectal borrowing among Guaranian varieties. This view is discussed and rejected here after detailed evaluation. I show that the correspondences in question are not as chaotic as implied, and that evidence from the Guaranian branch calls for the reconstruction of two affricate segments for PTG. Minor correspondence patterns with special reflexes in Guaranian and in other Tupi-Guarani languages are plausibly explained by other, independent developments such as palatalization, dialectal borrowing, and sporadic/reductive losses in compounds. Although the traditional reconstruction of two segments is vindicated, we offer here the first explicit formulation of this proposal backed up by comparative reconstruction of PTG etyma.\n\nThis paper offers a brief description of the phonology and phonetics of the Amapari variety of Wajãpi (AW), a Tupian language of the Tupi-Guarani family spoken in northeastern Amazon regions of Brazil and French Guyana. I discuss the evidence for the contrastive status of its segmental units, with emphasis on the more salient phonetic manifestations of these elements and with comparisons with other Wajãpi dialects, better represented in the published literature. I argue that surface [kw] is best analyzed as a single complex segment kʷ and that AW differs from other Wajãpi varieties in retaining a contrast between w and β. I also provide evidence of the frequent realization of the glottal stop as supra-segmental glottalization, and of processes of both regressive and progressive nasalization. Particularly noteworthy is the evidence for a gradient process of regressive height harmony in vowels and of the predictable nasalization of final unaccented-a, two processes not described so far for other Wajãpi varieties.\n\nThe geographical term \"Bolivian Tupi-Guarani languages\" does not mean that these languages form a single subgroup within the Tupi-Guarani family. The so-called Chiriguano group (now Western Guarani and its dialects, as well as Tapiete), historically and typologically belongs to the Southern Guarani cluster. Another subgroup is formed by the Sirionoid group (Siriono, Yuki, and Horá or Jorá). Guarayu and Warazu (traditonally Pauserna) form another subgroup, both being rather independent. The paper includes new phonological and morphosyntactic data of the recently first described Warazu.\n\nBackground Recent advances in automated assessment of basic vocabulary lists allow the construction of linguistic phylogenies useful for tracing dynamics of human population expansions, reconstructing ancestral cultures, and modeling transition rates of cultural traits over time. Methods Here we investigate the Tupi expansion, a widely-dispersed language family in lowland South America, with a distance-based phylogeny based on 40-word vocabulary lists from 48 languages. We coded 11 cultural traits across the diverse Tupi family including traditional warfare patterns, post-marital residence, corporate structure, community size, paternity beliefs, sibling terminology, presence of canoes, tattooing, shamanism, men's houses, and lip plugs. Results/Discussion The linguistic phylogeny supports a Tupi homeland in west-central Brazil with subsequent major expansions across much of lowland South America. Consistently, ancestral reconstructions of cultural traits over the linguistic phylogeny suggest that social complexity has tended to decline through time, most notably in the independent emergence of several nomadic hunter-gatherer societies. Estimated rates of cultural change across the Tupi expansion are on the order of only a few changes per 10,000 years, in accord with previous cultural phylogenetic results in other language families around the world, and indicate a conservative nature to much of human culture.\n\nThis paper offers a brief description of the phonology and phonetics of the Amapari variety of Wajãpi (AW), a Tupian language of the Tupi-Guarani family spoken in northeastern Amazon regions of Brazil and French Guyana.

A summary reconstruction of proto-maweti-guarani segmental phonology Uma reconstrução resumida da fonologia segmental proto-mawetí-guaraní sérgio Meira i , sebastian drude ii i Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi. Belém, Pará, Brasil ii Max-Planck-institute for Psycholinguistics. nijmegen, the netherlands Abstract: this paper presents a succinct reconstruction of the segmental phonology of Proto-Maweti-Guarani, the hypothetical protolanguage from which modern Mawe, Aweti and the tupi-Guarani branches of the tupi linguistic family have evolved. Based on about 300 cognate sets from the authors' field data (for Mawe and Aweti) and from Mello's reconstruction (2000) for Proto-tupi-Guarani (with additional information from other works; and with a few changes concerning certain doubtful features, such as the status of stem-final lenis consonants *r and *ß, and the distinction of *c and *č), the consonants and vowels of Proto-Maweti-Guarani were reconstructed with the help of the traditional historical-comparative method. the development of the reconstructed segments is then traced from the protolanguage to each of the modern branches. A comparison with other claims made about Proto-Maweti-Guarani is given in the conclusion. Resumo: Este artigo apresenta uma reconstrução resumida da fonologia segmental do Proto-Maweti-Guarani, a protolíngua hipotética intermediária, dentro da família linguística tupi, da qual se desenvolveram o Mawé, o Aweti e as línguas tupi-Guarani atuais. Baseando-se em cerca de 300 conjuntos de cognatos, provenientes dos dados de campo dos autores (Mawé e Aweti) e dos dados lexicais publicados por Mello (2000, tupi-Guarani), em informações adicionais de outras fontes publicadas (com algumas modificações relativas a certos aspectos duvidosos das reconstruções atuais do Proto-tupi-Guarani, como o status das consoantes lenes *r e *ß em fim de palavra, e a distinção entre *c e *č), reconstruímos as consoantes e vogais do Proto-Maweti-Guarani com o auxílio do método histórico-comparativo tradicional. Ao fim do artigo, traça-se o desenvolvimento dos segmentos reconstruídos desde a protolíngua até cada um dos três ramos modernos. na conclusão, oferecemos uma comparação rápida com outras hipóteses sobre o Proto-Maweti-Guarani.
