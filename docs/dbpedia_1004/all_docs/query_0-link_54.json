        "text": "Sociolinguists have long been interested in the actuation problem: why some linguistic varieties undergo specific structural change while others do not (Weinreich, Labov, & Herzog, Reference Weinreich, Labov, Herzog, Lehmann and Malkiel1968:112). Here, we engage with this question by examining constructed dialogue, the reproduction of speech, thought, gesture, and sound effects (Tannen, Reference Tannen and Coulmas1986) in a longitudinal corpus of Australian Aboriginal English (AE) spoken in Perth, Western Australia. AE is a post-invasion contact variety, or group of varieties, “spoken by the majority of Aboriginal people throughout Australia” (Eades, Reference Eades, Koch and Nordlinger2014:417). These varieties differ in terms of their placement on a continuum ranging from acrolectal to basilectal features (Rodríguez Louro & Collard, Reference Rodríguez Louro and Collard2021a). Acrolectal AE varieties are relatively close to standardized Australian English (AusE); basilectal AE varieties are closer to Kriol, an English-lexified creole spoken in Northern Australia (Schultze-Berndt, Meakins, & Angelo, Reference Schultze-Berndt, Meakins, Angelo, Michaelis, Maurer, Haspelmath and Huber2013). Here, we consider “standardized AusE” to be the codified variety used in mainstream institutions, including schools and courtrooms. A longstanding question has been whether AE should be viewed as a single ethnolect or whether one should speak of “Aboriginal Englishes” (Dickson, Reference Dickson, Willoughby and Manns2020:136). We focus on an acrolectal variety of AE spoken in Perth, Nyungar country, Southwest Western Australia. We use the label “AE” to refer to “one major variety of Aboriginal English, which embraces a number of regional varieties” (Malcolm, Reference Malcolm2018:124).Footnote 1\n\nA pressing issue for L1 speakers of AE is that of contact with standardized AusE. The AE speakers in our corpus have all worked, lived, and/or attended school alongside speakers of AusE. They have had “more than superficial contact” with AusE speakers, with increased “potential for transfer on all levels of linguistic structure” (Meyerhoff, Reference Meyerhoff2009:298). Additionally, First Nations youth are avid social media and digital technology users (Rice, Haynes, Royce, & Thompson, Reference Rice, Haynes, Royce and Thompson2016:3). While specific linguistic material (such as be like) may not have spread in this way (Tagliamonte, Reference Tagliamonte2014), these media are likely to impose a normative influence that is not necessarily ethnolect-specific.\n\nThe potential for linguistic transfer is heightened in global cities such as Perth. Globalization has recently been linked to the ingress of linguistic variants readily taken up by metropolitan youth in mainstream communities. Quotative be like is one such variant, and the quotative system of “settler colonial Englishes” (Denis & D'Arcy, Reference Denis and D'Arcy2018; we adopt the term throughout) has changed drastically since its emergence. For example, in standardized AusE, be like has ousted say as the most widely used quotative frame and it has been documented among speakers born as early as 1967 (Rodríguez Louro, Reference Rodríguez Louro2013). Additionally, the expansion of be like in settler colonial Englishes has been linked to the rise of psychological drama in narrative, with speakers encoding their thought as monologic performances that, starting in the late 1960s, led to the rise of reporting first-person inner dialogues, “the very niche of be like” (Tagliamonte, D'Arcy, & Rodríguez Louro, Reference Tagliamonte, D'Arcy and Rodríguez Louro2016:839-840). In fact, D'Arcy (Reference D'Arcy, Grund and Walker2020) has argued that the very reason be like became so widespread in settler colonial Englishes is that the entire quotative system was already in flux before be like's emergence. Globalization may have helped be like diffuse across settler colonial communities (Buchstaller & D'Arcy, Reference Buchstaller and D'Arcy2009; Tagliamonte et al., Reference Tagliamonte, D'Arcy and Rodríguez Louro2016), but storytelling in those communities already favored thought and attitude reporting in narrative. Be like arrived to fill an existing functional niche and subsequently spread to other kinds of constructed dialogue reporting (see Gardner, Denis, Brook, & Tagliamonte, Reference Gardner, Denis, Brook and Tagliamonte2021).\n\nThis scenario offers an ideal testing ground. Storytelling “is an essential element of Aboriginal cultural life” (Malcolm, Reference Malcolm2018:10), and quotation occupies a premium place in the complicating action of a narrative (Rodríguez Louro & Ritz, Reference Rodríguez Louro and Ritz2014:560). Given sustained contact between AE and AusE, has the quotative system of AE speakers in Nyungar country changed in line with the global shifts in settler colonial Englishes, including AusE? What do any similarities/differences tell us about what is systematic and unique in AE? Additionally, in the quotative system of earlier and contemporary AE, which patterns indicate continuity, and which ones signal change?\n\nVariationist research into First Nations languages (including contact varieties like AE) is still emergent vis-à-vis variationist studies elsewhere (Stanford, Reference Stanford2016). Apart from Dickson and Durantin (Reference Dickson and Durantin2019), Dixon (Reference Dixon2017), Mailhammer (Reference Mailhammer2021:149–156), and Clews, Rodríguez Louro, and Collard (Reference Clews, Rodríguez Louro and Collard2021), English-lexified postcontact varieties in Australia have received no attention from the variationist literature. Drawing on Rodríguez Louro and Collard's (Reference Rodríguez Louro and Collard2021b) decolonial variationist fieldwork methods, this paper offers a variationist analysis of longitudinal AE as used in Nyungar country. Our study is important because it shows how a global change may enter an indigenized variety, and because research generalizations are much improved with the participation of diverse populations.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. We first review research into English quotation. We then introduce the data and methods used in our study, followed by our distributional results and statistical models. We finally present our findings vis-à-vis existing trends in the extant literature, underscoring the entrenched practice of direct speech encoding in AE.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown that, in synchrony, AE quotation is characterized by functional partitioning such that different quotative frames, including say, be like, go, think, and “zero,” correspond to different pragmatic functions. We have also established, through the analysis of a longitudinal corpus of AE, that AE characteristically utilizes quotative devices to introduce direct speech. Crucially, this trajectory does not entirely diminish with the passing of time.\n\nThese findings indicate that AE has adopted the linguistic changes attested in mainstream Englishes (i.e., the use of be like as a quotative verb), but the longitudinal trajectory of this development is not entirely akin to that of mainstream Englishes, including AusE. We leave it to future research to determine whether, in the context of direct quotation in yarning, be like might herald deep-seated cultural change."
