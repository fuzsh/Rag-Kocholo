        "text": "Author: Ben Fisher-Rodriguez\n\nCalendar Talk – Keeping Your Fingers on the Pulse of Classroom Cultural Life\n\nCalendar Talk often comes up in conversations about “essential” techniques, and for good reason: it can be a fantastic way to participate in the lives of your students, and provide windows into other cultures! The class is able to share about important events and moments in their lives, and the teacher keeps their finger on the pulse of what is current and important to the students in their class. (The older I get, the more I find myself thinking, “The what? Why is that cool? What are they doing? My lower back hurts. This is just a rehash of the 90s. What is happening.“)\n\nWhy should you use Calendar Talk in your classroom? Calendar Talk allows everyone to talk about the things that matter in their lives lately, while also providing an opportunity to learn about and connect to important dates in other cultures, and can thus build deep, powerful connections between classmates and the instructor for maximum joy and acquisition.\n\nWhen do I use Calendar Talk?\n\nCalendar Talk is a very flexible technique: it can be incorporated into instruction as just part of an opening (or even closing) routine, or it can be a standalone activity itself. In any case, Calendar Talk generates a lot of language that is personalized to the class.\n\nAs for when in the school year to use this technique: literally whenever! I find myself starting the year with it because it can be a very safe activity, but I find my use of it ebbs and flows based on student (and instructor, hello) interest. But then, it can be a great palate-cleanser between lots of new activity types, units, or at points in the year when everyone just needs a win (and some connection to go with it). It can be the comforting home base to return to when the class has taken the midnight train to Crazy Town. (This never happens to me, what are you talking about…)\n\nHow do I do it? – Logistics\n\nFirst, get ye a calendar! You want to find a format that works for you.\n\nI typically draw a calendar grid onto a large piece of butcher paper or a giant Post-It. You want it to be big enough to be visible to students and also usable for an entire month. I have joined the legions of Mr. Sketch-addicted teachers to draw and mark the calendars. I find that you can use one calendar for all classes, though sometimes classes get a lot of information out onto the calendar OR feel a strong sense of ownership that might require you to get separate calendars for certain classes. Take into account cost and materials and do what makes sense for you.\n\nMuch more economically friendly is just printing a blank calendar template from online onto printer paper, and writing on it using a doc cam. I typically search “[month] calendar” in the Target Language to see if I can get relevant cultural celebrations already built into the calendar, and because the format is often different from US-American calendars. (German calendars, for instance, start on Mondays, not Sundays. Culture!)\n\nIf you want to go a digital route, get a template that is easy to use and reuse. During distance learning, I used this free calendar I found online (in German and in Spanish) with easy to copy/paste graphics to move around the calendar pages. It is also easy to make copies of pages so that each class can have its own calendar, and you could even link the calendar slide in view-only mode to a course website.\n\nAn alternative for both of these is to just use Small Talk Slides that can help cover the same sorts of information, but without the same calendar visual. A disadvantage is that the actual calendar page serves as a visual scaffold and memory bank – I would venture a guess that most students have seen a calendar and would have its format as a starting point for understanding – but an advantage is that having a closed set of choices can help students be more expressive and not be intimidated by trying to come up with what’s going on in their lives lately, in the L2, when they might not feel quite comfortable doing that. (But also: accepting relevant L1 as part of Calendar Talk can help lower the affective filter, and if you can just rephrase into comprehensible L2, students can acquire personalized, highly relevant vocabulary.)\n\nPick a format that feels easy and workable for you and your classroom context! And if you have found any sweet templates in your internet browsing, please share them in the comments.\n\nHow do I do it? – Procedure\n\nDisplay the calendar of your choosing so that all students can clearly see it. Or, if you want, you might just draw out the calendar live in front of your students, narrating what you are doing in the L2. “I am going to draw a calendar. I am drawing a line, a line, etc. Hmm…let’s think. Monday…Tuesday…Wednesday… What month is it? Oh, it’s September!” etc.\n\nIntroduce the calendar in language at your students’ level. This can range from: “This…is… a calendar! Look…at the calendar! Wow! Let’s talk…about the calendar!” to “Today, we’re going to talk about what is going on in your lives lately, and what’s going on at our school. Let’s also learn about what’s going on in [Target Culture community]!”\n\nTo ease into the activity, it can be nice to start with just the date, and the weather. For upper level students, or level 1s who are familiar, just asking “What day is today? What is today’s date?” gets the job done, where beginner students will need more scaffolded questions. You might point at the relevant spots on the calendar and ask this-or-that questions, like “Is today Tuesday…or Wednesday? Is tomorrow Wednesday…or Thursday? Is today or tomorrow Tuesday? Ah yes, today is Tuesday, and tomorrow is Wednesday.” Writing new-to-your-students vocabulary on the board in L1 and L2 can help support making this early-in-the-year activity 100% comprehensible. Writing words like “today” directly onto the calendar can help with this, too.\n\nThen, you can move on to the weather! Beginning with “How is the weather?” you might offer choices again (“Is it sunny…or cloudy?”) with visual supports (drawings or writing in L1 and L2), show the class a list of options, or with students who are ready, just let them answer however they can. You can draw that onto the calendar to record it and scaffold understanding.\n\nIf students are familiar with Calendar Talk, everything before this was just the warm up…here’s where it gets interesting! Now, ask the class if there is anything important or interesting happening today, or this week/month. Anything! This can be birthdays of students or their family members, sports matches, performances, school events, holidays – anything! It is likely that students will offer these ideas in L1 – that’s totally okay. You can just let them share, or set a limit for how much L1 you accept, and then rephrase their sharing into comprehensible L2. Aim to use high-frequency vocabulary in doing so – leaning on the Sweet 16 verbs and writing new vocabulary on your board – so that your students can use and reuse that language when talking about their own lives. “Oh! Soandso…has a football game…on Friday! Does Soandso have a football game or a football practice on Friday? etc etc”\n\nAsk lots of natural follow up questions to what students share. “Where?” and “With whom?” are great questions to get more information out of a student’s sharing, and these added details allow you to see a fuller picture of your students’ lives. “Where will you play the football game?” can lead into discussions about how students get to and from their sports practices, how much time they invest in their extracurriculars, and so much more. “With whom do you play video games?” can easily lend itself to a discussion about favorite games and genres, the trials and tribulations of online gaming lobbies, what gaming systems they had when they were younger, and if students have favorite streamers they like to watch play. Generally relying on question words (which I always have posted in my classroom) gives you a lot of ways to go with whatever students share, but also – follow your own curiosity! Especially if you don’t know much about a student’s hobby, this gives them a chance to teach you something. All the while, check frequently for class comprehension, and ask processing/circling questions about what is learned.\n\nSee if you can connect events and happenings to as many students as possible. If you’re discussing a birthday, poll the class on who has birthdays in what month, if it’s better to have a birthday during the summer or during the school year, how old everyone in class is, who’s the oldest and youngest, etc. (We had a student in one class last year that we affectionately dubbed “Grandpa” because he was an older junior in a class of freshmen, and the next oldest student was “Uncle Soandso.” I, of course, was “Great Grandpa FishRod.”) Sharing about video games or sports can lead to questions about who also enjoys playing, or who just watches, or who has a sibling who plays. The discussion is never just about any one kid – it always can involve the whole class. Any new words are going up on the board, and getting repeated in processing/circling questions frequently throughout.\n\nDiscuss upcoming events for as long as students maintain interest and attention! This is something you will just have to feel out. Sometimes, students are quiet, but engaged, and you can continue discussing for a while. Sometimes, the rambunctious sharing energy is too much, and you just have to move on. Sometimes…you just want to get to the next activity. Move on when you’re ready to move on!\n\nWhat do I do with it now that we’ve finished?\n\nAt the end of a session of Calendar Talk, I try to review the new information we just learned about our classmates. This can be as simple as oral questioning, or could be playing The Mysterious Person game. This can help students acquire more of any new language through more comprehensible repetitions, and give you a chance to shine the spotlight one more time on the students in your class.\n\nI also like to make sure I have saved what is learned on the calendar in some visual way. Whether it’s writing key words in L2 (“Football game” “New video game” “No school” “Tech week”) onto the calendar, or just drawing little icons to jog everyone’s memory, recording what was learned onto the calendar visual stamps the lives of your students into an important classroom document. This can serve to remind you later to check in with students about things they mentioned: “Hey, how was the track meet? Where did you end up going to eat on your birthday?” Nothing makes someone feel more special than getting checked up on.\n\nThe visuals on the calendar can also serve as great scaffolds to start a Write and Discuss text. This gives students a chance to see more complete written sentences, and notice anything interesting about how the L2 is written. This can also serve to reinforce any new vocabulary that came up spontaneously during the sharing from your students’ lives, which ends up creating a sort of personalized vocabulary list for your class.\n\nTo round out the experience, you might also administer a Quick Quiz as a formative assessment. This can give students even more repetitions of new, relevant vocabulary, and can be a real confidence booster.\n\nPro Tips!\n\nIt is not about teaching calendar stuff! Sure, we can use the calendar to learn the words for “today, yesterday, tomorrow,” the weather and numbers, etc., but the calendar is really a springboard for asking students what else they are doing in their lives besides just being your students, and how they are doing in their lives. If we focus on the “calendar vocab” instead of on the lives of our students, we are missing out on opportunities to learn more about their lives, connect with them, and connect them to each other. Calendar Talk is about building community, and discovering the cultures of your class.\n\nShare from your own life! Don’t be afraid to put events from your own life on the calendar, because you are also a member of your classroom community. As much as you feel comfortable sharing, this can help build even more connections between you and your students.\n\nFavorite day of the week! I have learned some fascinating things by asking the class what their favorite days of the week were. Many students pick weekend days, with specific reasons why one day is better than another, but sometimes students will pick a weekday for an interesting reason. One student picked Thursday and told me that it was because it was the day her favorite webcomic dropped new panels. Glad I asked instead of just saying “we all love Saturday, right?”\n\nFind the style that suits you! Some teachers feel comfortable with sprawling discussions that can take from 10 minutes to the entire period, and feel comfortable managing the flow of new language into the activity. I try to ride the energy of my class, which is variable every day, and feel comfortable improvising a bit as students share their various life events. Some teachers want to keep an activity like this more controlled. In that case, offer choices that students must choose from, as opposed to leaving things more open. “Who has a game this weekend? Do you have a football game or a lacrosse game? etc.” And if you are ever feeling so overwhelmed that it isn’t feeling worth it: move on! It’s okay! You can always try again.\n\nDay of the Day! There are tons of declared holidays around the world, some interesting and historical, some just wacky. Writing them into your class calendar and discussing them with your students as a way to personalize the calendar can be really rewarding and fun. You can use this excellent website for ideas, or look at calendars in your Target Language to see if anything comes up.\n\nMake cultural connections! Keeping an eye on current events and holidays in your Target Culture(s) can make Calendar Talk a natural opportunity to introduce more of the Target Culture(s) into your classes! Write them onto the calendar ahead of time to remind yourself, and open discussions that allow students to make cultural connections and comparisons. My students have always been interested in holidays that offer time off of school in the Target Culture (haha!), elections, regional festivals…\n\nMake connections with people from the Target Culture(s)! It can also be fun to introduce celebrities from a Target Culture, perhaps on a day when they did something significant, or on their birth or death days.\n\nHire a meteorologist! Once discussing the date and weather loses its luster for the whole class, you can hire for the class job of “Meteorologist.” This person can stand up at the beginning of Calendar Talk, sometimes to the applause of their peers, and briefly report on the date and weather. One of my students used to run out the door to get the absolute best read on the current weather and return in a dramatic burst, and another used to give some sort of encouraging message to the class to start the day. Great fun!\n\nLook up the weather in Target Culture locations! While you’re on the topic of weather, it can be fun to look up the weather in other cities around the world. This naturally allows you to make comparisons between your city and the other city or cities, and might also teach your students about Fahrenheit and Celsius! You might find a link to a weather website in the Target Language – I always use wetter.de and show students the capital cities of the German-speaking world, as well as the city where I used to live.\n\nDo it however you like! This blog post is informed by years of practice and learning from other teachers, and I’m hoping it offers you lots of options for how you might go about doing Calendar Talk. But! Don’t feel like you have to do it all. Again, Calendar Talk is only kind of about the calendar. Mostly, it’s about learning more about your students’ lives and cultures, and connecting them to each other and you. If you focus on that, you can’t go wrong.\n\nWhat if I want to learn more?\n\nHere is Claudia Elliott’s post about why she uses Calendar Talk, including a video of her doing it with a Spanish 3 class. She also has a whole episode of her fabulous podcast on the topic!!\n\nThis is Maris Hawkin’s post about Calendar Talk, which comes with some very helpful linked resources!\n\nI also loved this post from Spanish with Stephanie that includes lots of great resources and examples.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you feel ready to use Calendar Talk? Comment below and send me any questions you might have!\n\nClassroom: Managed – Physical Skills to Practice and Refine\n\nI have been thinking about the school year beginning soon – I still have about three weeks to get my last bits of rest in, and plan for my best year yet. In addition to thoughts of curriculum and activities, I have been thinking about classroom management, and how to always be improving my skills.\n\nIt’s easy to think that classroom management is either something you have, or something you don’t, and that this is based somehow around your personality. Some teachers just look like naturals, and teachers who share online don’t often share their management struggles. But with time, experience, and practice, I have joined management expert Jon Cowart in finding that classroom management is actually a skill set that you can develop, and having solid management is essential to making all the amazing curriculum and activities happen.\n\nClassroom management encompasses so many different things, including teacher-student relationships, student-student relationships, physical classroom setup, the way we phrase our instructions and expectations, how we respond to student behaviors, etc. In this post, I want to focus on some physical skills – how we use our voices and bodies – that have helped me feel like I am managing a more positive, productive classroom with clear, learning-supportive expectations.\n\nBreathe: This is Classroom Management Skill #1 for me. No matter what is happening, taking a moment to take a deep breath is how we can calm any nerves or annoyance that we are feeling, and access our best, most responsive selves. Consciously breathing deeply slows us down, and makes us more present to the real people in front of us. This can be the difference between snapping at a student in a way we later regret, and communicating calmly how an expectation has been broken, and how best to move forward. Breathe. Do it now while you’re reading, even!\n\nPlant Your Feet: In my home life, I’m always pacing around the house to get out all my nervous energy. In front of a classroom, this pacing and constant movement can be infectious, and distracting. To lend gravity and focus to what we are conveying to students, we can plant our feet squarely on one spot as best we can, not move from that spot, and just turn our bodies from left to right to scan the entire class. If we want to move to a new position, we can use it like punctuation: landing where we’re going at the end of a statement, and then continuing our next idea from that new planted spot. This helps bring physical cohesion to the words we are saying.\n\nSpeak Slowly: Taking time to breathe can slow our bodies down, which can help us also speak more slowly. Speaking slowly increases the chance that students will comprehend what we are saying, regardless of language. This can also decrease the frustration at lack of “keeping up” that can lead to disengagement. It’s good for management, and good for making sure students are getting the comprehensible input they need for acquisition! We need not speak in an exaggerated or unnatural way, just slower than our conversational speeds. Think how comforting the cadence of Mr. Rogers is, or Miss Rachel! (This one is particularly difficult for me, being a Hyper Speed Yapper.)\n\nLook Into Your Students’ Eyes: In public speaking, we are often told to look just above the heads of our audience to help with nerves and delivery. If we take the time to look all our students in their eyes, we can often stop disruptions before they start. How often do students really feel seen at school? I try to look every student in the eye at least once per class, which gives me space to smile, nod, encourage, show interest, raise my eyebrows preventatively – so many small gestures that are not invasive for their peers, but let kids know that we are present with them.\n\nProximity: I think proximity often does get talked about in relation to classroom management, but it’s worth reiterating. I use it in a spectrum, beginning just with eye contact with a student that is beginning to interrupt others’ learning. Then, I turn my body to face that specific student, while still addressing and teaching the whole class. Then, I move slowly toward the student in question, building in pauses and planting my feet for a while in one spot to see how close I will need to get to redirect the student. All the while, I am making eye contact more frequently with the student, even as I continue to just teach class. Sometimes students catch on and change their behaviors before I even move very much in their direction. If I make it all the way to a kid, I bend over or crouch so I am closer to their seated level, and quietly tell them what I want them to be doing at that time. This sounds something like, “Right now, we are answering questions about the map in German.” Or, “We can respond to the video with rejoinders or words in German.” Always seek the least invasive interaction, as best you can, and describe what you want your students to actually do (versus not do).\n\nSelf-Interrupt: If a student starts talking L1 while we are talking L2, we can simply stop talking immediately. The break in classroom “noise” often snaps loudly in students’ attention, and if we can patiently hold the pause in whatever we were saying until it is clear that we are responding to talking out of turn, then we can reinforce how we will focus and participate in class. I am usually turned toward the L1-speaking student in question, and once they stop, I carry on with whatever I was saying in L2, after a pause. Adding a smile back at the student who changed their behavior a few seconds later can convey, “That was an oops! Thanks for getting back on board.” Of course, if a student doesn’t respond to this intervention for whatever reason, use proximity or an attention-getter to redirect that particular student.\n\nRespond Every Time: Every time a student does something that disrupts their peers’ learning, and especially if their actions serve to belittle, demean, or intimidate other students for any of their preferences or identities, we must respond. Even just stopping what you were doing and saying, “That is not how we behave here” or “We don’t talk like that here” is better than no response at all. Much of classroom management is setting boundaries for what we accept as part of the classroom culture, and we are the leaders in that boundary setting. Choosing to act, rather than to just look the other way, models to the rest of the class how we can positively deal with offensive, interruptive, or just plain annoying behavior, and can convey a commitment to protecting students with marginalized identities. It’s never “just a joke.” Respond. Every. Time.\n\nAddress the Class But Look at the Student Who Needs Support: When a student has done something offensive or demeaning, it is tempting to direct all your righteous indignation right at them. It can be more powerful to turn to the whole class and remind the whole class of the classroom/school expectations (“At our school, we show respect for the differences of others” etc.), and then look the offending student in the eyes to make clear that we registered their behavior and are responding to it. This can prevent a bigger interruption should a student try to engage in a power struggle, and gives you both time to cool down until you can request a follow-up with that student later in the period.\n\nGive Instructions, Then Freeze: This is a small thing that has had a huge impact for me. When students are about to begin a task in groups, or independent work, I make sure the instructions are understood clearly, with lots of comprehension checks. Then, I say: “You are going to do XYZ starting in 3…2…1…Go!” Then I freeze. And I stare at them. All of them, in the eyes! This conveys, “No, really, get started,” and allows you to very quickly see who needs more support or resources to get to the task at hand. If I start myself moving too quickly after giving the “Go!” signal, it takes students longer to start, and I miss out on formatively assessing who feels confident to dive into the task straight away.\n\nDemon Voice: This is goofy, but sometimes, if a student is not following expectations while I address the whole class, I will just say their name quickly in a deep, dark demon voice, and then continue on with my normal voice toward the rest of the class, saying whatever I was trying to say. It is usually just surprising enough to help the student readjust toward the classroom expectations, and can get some smiles and laughs, as well. Make sure you have good relationships with your students before you try this, though, because it is admittedly…wacky. 🙂 “Alright, everyone. Today, we are going to JOANN be learning about sports in German-speaking countries. (smile and wink)”\n\nPractice: Teaching is Everything, Everywhere, All at Once. There are so many microhabits that make up the art and science of teaching, and it can feel very overwhelming. But! Olympic runners did not get down the mechanics of a technically strong start that transitions into a technically strong stride on the first go. They practiced, failed, tried again. So, with all these skills and the myriad other skills I didn’t mention here, it just takes time and practice to get them to work to their best. Have faith, gentle reader. You’ve got this!\n\nWhat other physical skills do you consider essential for classroom management? Comment below!\n\n90% Target Language: How to Work Toward This Core Practice\n\nACTFL recommends that teachers and learners aim for 90%+ of class time to be spent in the Target Language, and lists the facilitation of Target Language usage as one of its six Core Practices. Comprehensible Input is the sine non qua of language acquisition, of course, so in my view, Target Language usage is something we constantly need to be reflecting on as part of our teaching practice. Approaching that 90% has been a goal of mine for years (indeed, I made visiting as many sessions about 90%+ TL the focus of my attendance at ACTFL 2017 in Nashville), and I am finally getting to a place where I am feeling pretty good about my abilities to execute this Core Practice. Part of that is recognizing that 50% days, 70% days, 99% days, and 20% days are all okay, too, and part of the natural ebb and flow of working in a very human profession.\n\nI have been reflecting a lot on how I have been working on this in my own classroom, and what I think are some key pieces in getting to 90%. I imagine this will be an evolving set of reflections, so let’s get started with where I am right now:\n\nTrust\n\nI really think one of the keys to getting to high levels of Target Language is building student’s trust that you will help them understand the TL at every step along the way.\n\nThis begins with an explicit commitment to students: “I want you to understand everything that is going on in our class, and I will do my best to make everything clear to you.” As an example, Cécile Lainé demonstrates this commitment with how she introduces the physical signal students give when they have not understood something: she asks students to make the audible signal (fist against open palm, snapping, tongue clicking, etc.) “when I say something and you don’t understand because I’m confusing you” so that she can “stop and help.” Students are also prompted to support their classmates by joining in making the designated sound – so if one student makes the noise because they don’t understand, everyone else also joins in to make sure that they can all get it.\n\nThis shows that she sees her primary goal as making sure every student understands, and that no student will be singled out for not understanding, no matter the reason. Students do have to show up and listen – and make the signal to show lack of comprehension – but their teacher is verbally committing to trying to be as clear as possible. If the teacher then celebrates the use of this signal, and clarifies spots where they confused students, that trusting relationship is built through words and actions. (Watch this video by Cécile to see the setup of these strategies in action – she is a master.)\n\nYou can also build trust by watching the eyes and faces of your students as you teach, and responding to blank or confused looks. If we explicitly verbalize, “I saw what looked like confusion to me, and I want to make sure everyone has got it so we can all learn together,” and then rephrase/restate/add a gesture or writing/etc., students will see that you are making good on your commitment to teaching them as clearly as you can. With a trusting relationship, teacher and learners can push each other to ever-higher levels of Target Language usage and skill.\n\nOur Mindset\n\nSometimes, we as teachers don’t trust ourselves to make high levels of TL usage happen, and/or we don’t trust that our students will rise to the high expectation of 90%+ TL usage. On the Language Lounge podcast, guest Marnina Falk reminded listeners of an essential mindset for us while working towards this goal: everyone can learn an additional language, and with the right supports, everyone can thrive in a class with high levels of TL usage. I remember a presentation I went to at WAFLT with Paul Sandrock where he shared research showing that students expect high levels of TL usage in their classes, but the teachers are the ones who back away from it out of fear! Perhaps we need to make it into daily affirmations: I can maintain an atmosphere of high TL usage – my students will thrive hearing lots of TL!\n\n“You are understanding”\n\nLanguage classes are so different from content courses, and carry an air of mystique and difficulty (perhaps because of previous generations’ lack of success with older methods). It is essential that we give our students early confirmations of their success in a high TL usage environment. This can be Quick Quizzes where we confirm that students have been comprehending the content of the day and ending class on a positive note, or just being clear during frequent comprehension checks: yes, you are doing the work of acquiring a language! You ARE understanding! I don’t think it’s out of bounds to just tell this to our students directly, in L1. We want to develop an inner voice in our students that says: I can do this, I AM doing this. Frequent formative assessment helps us share with students the path of proficiency so they can continue walking it.\n\nHaving Communicative Goals\n\nIf your goal is to teach and assess student knowledge about the grammatical forms of your TL, it is likely that you will use a lot of L1 to talk about linguistic terms. At the end of the course, students may have heard TL, but they will mostly have learned about the language, rather than having used the language.\n\nIf we want students to use the language, and we want to use it ourselves, we need to set communicative goals. These can be psychosocial (building relationships), cognitive-informational (obtaining information for some purpose), or entertainment.\n\nWe can learn about our classmates, their families and cultures and experiences, and the target culture(s), and also share how we are doing, what our preferences and opinions are, and also just have fun. I think the ACTFL Can Do Statements do a good job at reminding us that language is for DOING things, so having clarity about what function(s) we are trying to elicit helps make planning for target language usage – modeling, selecting useful vocabulary, questioning, etc. – much more effective and targeted.\n\nDon’t be afraid of English\n\nSome ACTFL publications take a hardline stance on English usage and basically tell you “don’t do it unless the building is on fire and you have to evacuate quickly.” I disagree with a hardline stance like that. (Obviously, uh, use L1 if the building is on fire, of course.) I read research somewhere (and am of course not finding it while I’m writing this, so thanks in advance to anyone who can send it my way!) that regardless of how hard we try to get learners to associate an L2 word with a wordless concept (vs. a related word in L1), they are still going to internally link new words to L1 meanings, anyways.\n\nWhat this means to me is that sometimes, I can draw a picture on the board or do a gesture that makes an L2 word’s meaning clear, and sometimes, I’m just going to write the word on the board in L2 and L1 (usually in different colors to be clear what belongs to which language). I’m not afraid of that! If I am committed to using that new word in the service of some sort of communicative goal, I’m going to use it in the L2, and the time spent establishing the meaning of the word in L1 will not have dragged at my 90%+ TL goal too much.\n\nI feel the same way about comprehension checks. Especially early in lower levels, I want to give the feeling of accomplishment and being-in-the-right-place to my students early, and often. Asking “what did I just say?” in L1 and hearing a confident choral response gives me the feedback that students are with me, and when I affirm that to my students, they know it for themselves, too. I find I use this sort of comprehension check less frequently as students move up in levels, but that’s because they have confidently acquired enough language to be more functional in the TL.\n\nInstructions can be the same way. If a quick explanation serves to get us all back into the TL to do a new activity or procedure, then giving it briefly in L1 works for me.\n\nWe have to be practical in our use of time in class, because we don’t have much of it, so we are mostly going to be in L2. But! Sometimes the quickest way to get to more L2 is through a little detour into L1. Reading Justin’s post about the role of the L1 in a class really clarified this for me.\n\nModel everything!\n\nIf you want students to do something, you can show them how to do it by narrating your own actions in the Target Language. If you have a movement prompt, model thinking about how you would respond to it, and then moving around your classroom to indicate your answer. If you have a new game or partner activity, either have the class be your partner to model, or pick a student you suspect will catch on quickly. You can play with this and just do classic TPR, too, modeling commands and then fading the modeling. Then: you can review any instructions with text on the board as a review before setting students to the task.\n\nRejoinders\n\nLearners want to feel connected to others and not feel isolated in class. This can express itself with verbal outbursts in the L1 that have the power to derail class, but can actually be a positive sign: they WANT to be a part of the classroom community and contribute their thoughts! But how can we get them to do that without opening a floodgate of L1?\n\nUsing rejoinders in the L2 – short phrases that indicate your reaction to something happening – can give students tools to participate and share that connectedness, while also keeping it in the TL. You can teach students maybe 2-3 at a time, perhaps with accompanying gestures that get the meanings of the rejoinders across, and make a point to find situations to use them in your class for about a week or so. Any time a student uses one, I always try to respond with positivity and excitement – because “using these phrases really makes you sound like an [L2] speaker!” I sometimes also prompt students by asking: “What would be a logical reaction to what Soandso just said / what just happened?”\n\nWhen students are shouting out “What a bummer!” and “How cute!” and “Awesome!” in the TL, it really does feel like you’re helping grow their abilities as L2 speakers, and makes it a sort of a game – in the Target Language! My students in particular like to use them ironically while staring me dead in the eye, and I mock outrage at their callousness. “Soandso has mountains of homework, and your reaction is ‘How lovely!’??! You monsters!” Boom: play, in the Target Language.\n\nI learned a lot of what I know about rejoinders from Grant Boulanger, and offer you some rejoinders in German, if you should need them. I print rejoinders on card stock, two to a sheet, and hang them with magnets on an awkwardly-shaped portion of whiteboard. When students have a good grasp on them, I “retire” them, pinning them above our smartboard, where they become a visual reminder of our growing linguistic repertoire.\n\nNon-verbal or single-word responses\n\nSometimes, we don’t need students to respond with words. They can respond with their movements! The “I don’t understand” signal from above comes first to mind. Students can also point at an option they prefer, or at an object (or sometimes person) in the room. They can stand up and move to Four Corners to share their opinions and experiences, or form a continuum. They can clap to agree, snap to disagree – or any variation on that idea. They can stand up to indicate “Me too!” All the while, we as the instructors are providing lots of rich input, interaction, and guided conversation.\n\nSometimes, it is also totally okay for students to give single-word responses. These could be choral responses to circling questions, making a choice after you provide a this-or-that question, or saying the name of a brand or place that they are familiar with in response to your prompting. These all require us to plan ahead to provide logical choices, and the more couched they are in TL sentences (“I like to eat chocolate/vanilla/strawberry ice cream” vs. just “chocolate/vanilla/strawberry”), the more input we can facilitate in the TL while also getting more information about and personalizing to our students.\n\n“May I speak English?”\n\nAbove my whiteboard, I have the phrase “May I speak English?” in the TL on a small poster. I teach students what it means in English, and then use it myself whenever I need to tell the students something in English. This establishes an environment where we are working to have class mostly in L2, and will show deference to others’ goals of using class time to really practice the L2 by asking permission to speak L1. The more I do this, the more students ask for permission!\n\nSometimes they forcefully say “no” to my requests – and I go okay! And try to convey what I needed to convey in L2. Sometimes I gently say “no” to my students – but mostly if I suspect they are trying to tell a derailing anecdote in L1. And sometimes, when I “allow” students to use L1, I also give them a guideline for how much. “Yes, but just one word.” “Yes, but just one sentence.” “Yes, but you have five seconds.” This makes it a fun game, and I can see if there needs to be further questioning afterward beyond the imposed limit.\n\nGo slow\n\nHere’s some research I found forever ago: the average high school student processes their native language at about 140-145 words per minute. On the other hand, the average adult speaks at about 170 words per minute. There seems to be a mismatch here – we’re talking faster than our students’ brains are ready for, and that’s just in the L1!\n\nIf we want our students to understand what they hear in the L2, which empowers us to use even more of it in class, we need to be modulating our rate of speech. This certainly does not mean talking comically slow, but slowER, with more pauses between chunks and ideas. This can really make the difference between students understanding and not understanding what you are trying to communicate. We might also emphasize certain new words or sounds with our voices to draw attention to them and help students make more form-meaning connections. (This can be especially true in languages where endings indicate who is being talked about, and/or when.)\n\nThis also doesn’t mean speaking slowly…forever. As students are more familiar with the language, they can process it faster and faster. Part of the fun for us, then, becomes slowly increasing our rate of speech over time (sometimes within the same class period), and watching students come more confidently along for the ride. Then, when they encounter audio or video texts where the speakers are not worried about slowing their rate of speech, they feel more confident to tackle them – because they had slow listening “practice” to start.\n\nOther resources\n\nSo many have had thoughts on this, and I will gather more resources here over time. That said, a huge influence for me (and an absolute gold mine of ideas) has been this post from the Comprehensible Classroom: How to Teach So That They Understand. Check it out!\n\nCelebrate!\n\nIf using a lot of TL in your class goes well: great! If it goes less well: return to your principles and skills of L2 usage and see what moments in class you fell out of L2 use. Collaborate with a colleague on ideas! You might also film yourself and check your rate of speech, use of visuals, questioning, etc., while also keeping an eye on how your class reacts to you.\n\nBut overall: celebrate. You’re working towards a core practice in our field. It’s going to be tough at times, but it will most certainly pay off for you and your students.\n\nWhat other reflections do you have about Target Language usage in language classes?

I love throwing a Volleyball Reading (which I call Tischtennis, or “table tennis” in German) to get me off the stage for a while, give students a chance to read the L2 aloud, and help their partners toward shared success. I use it enough that I can just tell students who to partner up with, say “Read the text Tischtennis!”, and they will hop to it without second thought. (I did it once during an observation, and the observer was impressed at the transition speed, and that the whole class was reading the L2 and working together!)\n\nWhy should you do it? Volleyball Translation is a great way to do a first, or second, or even third pass at reading a text, and allows students to do some partner work so you can make your next pedagogical decision. We all need that time off the “stage!”\n\nWhen do I use Volleyball Reading?\n\nLike I said above, you can use Volleyball Reading on any encounter with a text your class is reading. Maybe you’ve given a lot of auditory input on a topic, and students are ready to read the new language in text form for the first time. Maybe you’ve already read and discussed a text as a class, and want to give students some time to confirm their comprehension on a second pass with the text before moving on to extension activities. Maybe you’ve just co-created a Write and Discuss text as a class, and want students to reread the new text one more time. Or maybe – honestly – you want to buy yourself a couple minutes while you take care of whatever business comes across your Teacher Life / Human Person Life in the middle of a class. All you need is a text, and you can throw in a Volleyball Reading!\n\nHow do I do it? – Logistics\n\nStudents need access to a text (on the board or in hand), and to be partnered up in the manner of your choosing. Having one group of three sometimes happens, but everyone else should be in pairs. I like to display the instructions for the procedure to students as the activity is taking place, though they usually don’t need them the second or third time using it.\n\nHow do I do it? – Procedure\n\nIn the partnerships, designate who will begin – aka a “Partner 1.”\n\nPartner 1 reads the first sentence of the chosen text out loud in the Target Language.\n\nPartner 2 translates the sentence their partner just read out loud into English. Partner 2 then continues on by reading the next sentence in the text in the Target Language.\n\nPartner 1 translates the sentence Partner 2 just read out loud into English, and continues on by reading the next sentence in the Target Language.\n\nStudents continue on, alternating reading aloud in the two languages, until they have finished reading the entire chosen text. (Or, just set a time limit, if you need/want!)\n\nWhat do I do now that we’ve finished?\n\nYou can always follow a Volleyball Reading with asking questions about the text to confirm that students have understood the text well, to personalize the information in the text, or to extend student thinking about the topic.\n\nYou might also “park” on any new or troublesome vocabulary to give students more exposure to the new language by asking more personalized questions and/or comprehension questions related to the text.\n\nStudents have just finished reading a text, so you have the choice to assess, extend, or just plain move on!\n\nPro Tips!\n\nModel with a student first! As with any new procedure, we can help students do it more correctly the first time by modeling our expectations and what it looks like. Pick an outgoing student, and have them be Student 1 and read the first sentence of the text aloud. Model translating, and then reading the next sentence in the Target Language, and go back and forth until your class seems to get it. You could even model by having the entire class be Student 1, with you as Student 2! Seeing it in action helps students put it into motion quickly and accurately.\n\nEncourage partners to help each other out! Students are definitely encouraged to help each other when needed, whether it be pronouncing a word in the L2, or getting an accurate translation into English. If both partners can’t figure out a word or phrase, they can ask another partnership nearby for help! Students are encouraged to be resources for each other’s learning.\n\nSwitch partners! For shorter texts, working with one partner is just fine. For longer texts, having students find a new partner using a procedure of your choosing can help give them a brief break and reengage with the text. One procedure I like is having the new partnerships show each other the spots on the text that they had read up to with their previous partner(s), and start reading the text at the spot closest to the beginning of the text, or the “earlier” stopping point. This means that any “slower” readers will still get to read the entire text, and the “faster” readers can provide confident support on text they have already read and processed before.\n\nStart from the top if you finish early! Some partnerships blaze through a text, while others need a little longer to work through a text. Have fast finishers start again from the top if they finish early, or maybe start writing comprehension questions about the text (you could say that you want to use them for a Quick Quiz!). Anything to keep students engaged with the language longer!\n\nWrite common stumbling block words on the board! Because all students are working simultaneously and supporting each other, you have time to circulate through your classroom and listen for spots in the text where students are getting stuck. (Or just cheer students on if they are rocking it!) If I ever hear more than one pair stumble over the same section, I figure out the word/phrase that is tripping them up, and write that on the whiteboard with a translation or illustration to help the class.\n\nReview tough spots with the class using oral questioning! Any words that I write on the board to support struggling students can become quick targets for further questioning once we reconvene as a class. If many students struggled with a new word or phrase, I can give students more input with that vocabulary by asking comprehension and personalized questions using those words, making sure to point and pause at the words and their translations on my whiteboard to ensure comprehension.\n\nWhat if I want to learn more?\n\nHere is a blog post by the Comprehensible Classroom about Volleyball Translation. This post starts an interesting discussion about the use of translation in the language classroom, and how translation activities may move us away from the fabled 90%+ Target Language goal. I find that I use Volleyball Translation for brief enough periods that it doesn’t detract from my overall goal to use as much Target Language in class as possible – but it is always important to consider the When and Why of L1 use in our classes!\n\nThis is Chris Stolz’ take on the activity. I agree that we definitely don’t want to do it too frequently, and it loans itself best to reviewing to build confidence.\n\nHere is a post by Señorita Spanish about two ways to read with students, including Volleyball Reading. I love the clear examples, and reminding students “3 Before Me” – ask your neighboring peers for help before stopping to wait on help from the teacher!\n\nLance Piantaginni introduces a variant on Volleyball Reading called Silent Volleyball reading here. This can help lessen any anxieties about pronouncing the Target Language, although I find that Volleyball Translation is a great time for students to try out pronouncing more of the language for themselves in a low-stakes environment.\n\nHere is Keith Toda’s post on Volleyball Reading. He discusses a variation on grouping / partner-finding that I found neat!\n\nWhat do you think? Do you feel ready to use Volleyball Reading? Comment below and send me any questions you might have!\n\nIntroducing Our New Podcast: “SLAyyy: Second Language Acquisition for Everyone”\n\nHi all! My colleagues Bill Langley (he/him), Bryan Smith (he/they), and I have decided to start a new podcast, and that podcast is called “SLAyyy: Second Language Acquisition for Everyone”.\n\nJoin us for our first episode Monday, July 29, 2025 as we gaslight (reflect on our teaching successes and failures), gatekeep (read and interpret SLA research), and girlboss (share successes) in our language teaching.\n\nI respect Bill and Bryan as teachers and leaders so so much, and am so excited to talk to them in this format about the stuff we’re thinking about all the time! We are hoping to release regular episodes throughout the school year, so wish us luck in our new endeavor. And please, send us messages about the pod! We’d be happy to hear from you.\n\nCheck us out!

But some theorists argue that opportunities for negotiated output help learners gain easier access to the growing linguistic system, and are essential for building communicative competence. Additionally, most kids come to L2 courses expecting to themselves speak the L2 in class! If we don’t at the very least speak to their expectations, teenagers can get…restless.\n\nBut: how do we most efficiently facilitate this without raising their hackles, or having to take time as the teacher to try to talk to each individual kid? (FishRod is heard gently crying in the distance, reflecting on his class sizes of 30+) Enter: a “game” with many names that I learned from Tina Hargaden! You pose questions to the whole class, and in pairs, students alternate answering the questions, and recording the quality/quantity of their partner’s responses. Bam!\n\nWhy should you play the Partner Speaking Game / Q+A Game / Interpersonal Speaking Game? This can be a great way to build student awareness of the fact that all the input they receive is doing something, boost confidence, and give you a bit of a break! My students always come away from this game proud of what they are able to produce, and reflective on how they can increase their output for the future!\n\nWhen do I use the Partner Speaking Game?\n\nThe Partner Speaking Game is a great game to put at the end of a sequence of lots of auditory/reading exposure on a topic or story. Students need to be comfortable with the language you will be using to pose the questions during the game, and if your questions will be about a specific text, they need to be very, very familiar with it.\n\nIf I were doing a Movie Talk, for example, I would give loads of auditory input by describing stills from the video, then have students read one or more texts narrating what happens in the video, and make sure that they have had plenty more interaction with any new language (through Personalized Questions) before setting them up to play the Partner Speaking Game. We want our learners to be full-to-bursting with language so the “game” feels like a breeze!\n\nSidebar, I keep calling it a “game” (with the quotes) because it is basically a Retell or Interpersonal Speaking Assessment, with the addition of a “points” element so that students can push themselves for more “points” (aka – more output!). The game is just talking, plus points! Yippee!\n\nHow do I do it? – Logistics\n\nYou can definitely improvise your questions about recent content, but I always prepare my question sets ahead of time. The page I provide below has spaces for 8 responses, but because only one student will be answering at a time, I would need to prepare 16 questions to cover both partners’ papers.\n\nPartner students up using your preferred method. A group of 3 could work, but only if you have an uneven amount of students. Designate a “Partner A” and “Partner B” in each partnership, as well. (Either let the kids decide, or say that Partner A is the person closest to the door, with the longer hair, etc.)\n\nGive each individual student a copy of a sheet something like this. If you don’t teach German, feel free to copy and modify to your needs! Have students write their partner’s name at the top, then their name and what Partner (A/B) they are, and the date.\n\nDepending on how comfortable your students are with the language/content of the questions, you might have key vocabulary posted for all to see, or any visuals created by the class (maybe a drawing of an OWI story, a cooperative mural, etc.).\n\nHow do I do it? – Procedure\n\nExplain to your students (in L1 or L2) that they will be talking about [the topic that we have been discussing recently]. One partner will talk at a time, and the other partner will listen.\n\nExplain that you, the teacher, will be posing a question in L2, and giving students a certain amount of time for their answer, also in L2. (I do somewhere between 20 and 45 seconds – 20 seconds would mirror the timing of the AP Simulated Conversation task. You might also just let students talk until they fizzle out talking in the L2 – follow your heart – but I find that the limits keep things moving and keep things more in the L2.)\n\nWhile one partner is talking, the other is listening and “giving points” to their partner about the quality of their response. For example, if the speaker hears the question, understands it, and responds in L1, their partner can still give them a point! But if they hear the question, understand it, and say even a single simple sentence in the L2, BAM. 4 points! The “scoring rubric” I use is pictured above, and I try to give quick examples of what each level might sound like before we play the first time.\n\nAfter each question, students switch roles, so now the speaker is the listener, and vice versa. During the game, I keep track of this by saying: “Okay, now Partner B speaks, question 4: [the question].”\n\nBegin! Ask the first question you have prepared, set a timer for the responses, if you’d like, and listen for half the class to be answering at a time.\n\nContinue asking questions, with students alternating roles between each question, until you run out of time or reach the end of your prepared questions (or whatever sheet you end up using).\n\nWhat do I do with it now that we’ve finished?\n\nHave students tally the points their partner received at the bottom, and then give their partner the points paper. Students then flip their sheets over, and answer some reflection questions about how their speaking experience went today. This is more or less optional, but I find it helps drive home the fact that the students were speaking a lot of the L2 just now!\n\nI like to have students turn these sheets in so I can see how they did, as well as what their reflections on the process were. If students confess to not feeling confident, you can adjust your instruction to support them better by more frequently calling on them for comprehension checks (or checking more with the people around them, so that the student is hearing a neighbor with the correct answer frequently). Sometimes, the student might just need a pep talk from you about how they can do it, even if it feels hard at times!\n\nI keep portfolios of my students’ “major works,” and I like to throw these sheets into those portfolios as mile markers of their progress and comfort with speaking the L2. Otherwise, you can return them to students with jubilations and compliments about how great they did! If I do assign a grade to these, it is typically a very small amount of points, just because it wasn’t actually me assessing the quality of student responses.\n\nPro Tips!\n\nStart from the familiar and move away! When I’m drafting my questions, I typically start with about 2 slam-dunk questions for each partner right at the beginning of the game, typically easy questions about the opening moments of the text we’ve been working with. This builds confidences and greases the wheels for more speaking, I find. My next questions typically than follow the narrative order of whatever we had been reading or viewing. Then, I end with about 2 or more questions for each partner that are more personalized! If the previous questions were all about the narrative of a Movie Talk, for example, the final questions might be about what the student might have done in the same situation, or questions related to the themes/topics of the Movie Talk, for example. If the Movie Talk was about a middle school crush, I might ask, “What were you like in middle school?” or, “Did you have a crush in middle school?” At this point, they have already been using the language of the video context quite a bit, and can try to extend it to talking about themselves!\n\nCirculate! While students are answering questions, move about your classroom to hear the things they are saying. This can give you a quick formative assessment of where students are confident, and where they are struggling. It also gives you space to encourage any shy students, maybe providing a key word or idea to help them start answering the question.\n\nTeach students to be supportive listeners! I always demonstrate to my students that it is intimidating to talk your L2 to someone who is staring at you in stoney-faced silence. Model how one might nod and smile at their partner, and maybe even gestures or facial expressions that could indicate, “Yes, keep going!”\n\nTry a simpler version! An alternative to using the scoring sheet I linked above might be to just have partnerships count the number of words in their partner’s responses, with each word being a point. This can save you on setup time, and if you felt comfortable improvising, you could just ask questions about the day’s Card Talk, Special Person Interview, or other daily content. Students could tally on scrap paper, or just count with their fingers!\n\nSTICKERS! If you are overflowing with stickers, have students mark the quality of their partner’s responses by placing stickers in those boxes. That would require each partnership having a sheet of stickers to themselves, but boy do kids (even high schoolers! even adults!) love stickers!\n\nWhat if I want to learn more?\n\nBecause this game can go by many names, I haven’t been able to locate any other blog posts / videos about it – if you find any, let me know! I’d be happy to link them here for further reading.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you feel ready to use the Partner Speaking Game? Comment below and send me any questions you might have!\n\nFocus Writes: Growing in the Ability to Talk About the Most Important Subject\n\nMy units are different every year because the people who come to my classes every year are different! I try to build in ample time into my year for “wandering” with my classes – following the interesting things that come up in conversations – but I have also found it helpful to have certain topics/themes that I “do” (which really means start discussing, because topics spiral up over time) at certain levels to give me some anchors for planning. I try to tackle these set topics/themes using all of the Foundational Strategies I list here on my site, including Card Talk, One Word Image, Small Talk, and Special Person Interviews, with just a bit of steering towards each given topic.\n\nThis also helps me in speaking to the proficiencies my students are building at each level. After a few weeks of Card Talk toward the beginning of level 1, I can discuss with students their growing capacity to talk about hobbies and interests. Every student is going to be in a different place with the acquisition of the various necessary structures, but having the set topics/themes helps connect to one very compelling Why for many students: growing in their capacity to talk about the most important subject – themselves! (Of course, there are many Whys in language learning, such as building global community, learning from and with other cultures, and wanting to learn the world’s most beautiful language, German, but if our young people are in the identity formation stage of their development, it’s nice to nod to it!)\n\nA tweet by Profe Camacho led me to the idea of essentially using the same prompt all year long as a way to demonstrate student growth. And thus, the Focus Write was born into my practice!\n\nWhy should you do a Focus Write, then? A Focus Write can be a quick, simple tool to demonstrate student growth both to outside stakeholders (read: families, administrators, evaluators), as well as to our learners!\n\nWhen do I use Focus Writes?\n\nFocus Writes are a lot like Free Writes, which many CCLT teachers have written about. Here is Elicia Cárdenas’ post about Free Writes that covers what they are, and when/how to use them. Generally, you want to start using Focus Writes (and Free Writes) after students have had time to get lots of language input into their heads. I would do one no earlier than 6 weeks into the school year, preferably closer to 9.\n\nIt also helps if you can look back on language input that students have been receiving and group it into “topics” so that you can space out the Focus Writes over the course of the school year, and select the spiraling prompts for them (this will make sense later). I aim for five total Focus Writes on the “major” topics I cover in level 1, for example: Introducing Myself, Hobbies and Interests, Important People in My Life, Our School Life, and My Food and Drink Culture. These align with the expectations of the community college through which I offer my third year dual-credit course.\n\nHow do I do it? – Logistics\n\nTo help with word counting, I like to use special lined paper that has the number of words at the end of each line! I print out enough copies of this paper, modified for each unit to include the unit number and complete prompt, as well as a goal that I think will be attainable for most students. (I lifted the template from the inimitable Meredith White!)\n\nThe prompts spiral across the year to include everything that came before, as well as the most recent topic. Here are my level 1 topics as an example:\n\nEnd of unit 1: Introduce yourself\n\nUnit 2: Introduce yourself and your hobbies\n\nUnit 3: Introduce yourself, your hobbies, and your important people\n\nUnit 4: Introduce yourself, your hobbies, your important people, and your school life\n\nUnit 5: Introduce yourself, your hobbies, your important people, your school life, and your food/drink preferences\n\nMy lesson plans are my slideshows, so I always have a slide prepared that looks something like the one below that I use after the fourth unit in my level 1 course:\n\nNow, by the third or fourth unit, five minutes does not feel like enough time to answer all the prompts, and I’m actually okay with that! If my students feel like they have enough to write and talk about for five minutes, then I am content, and they will be able to see their own growth.\n\nI have only been doing this in level 1 as students develop language, but this could easily be transferred to other levels for the purpose of building student writing portfolios.\n\nHow do I do it? – Procedure\n\nThe first time I do it, I tell students that we are going to be writing as much as we can in L2 for five minutes. The first topic is to just introduce yourself, saying as much about yourself as you can in the L2!\n\nStudents usually have a question at this point about the grading. I tell students that we are going to do this 5 times total throughout the year, and they will get an A if they increase their word count of logical German writing over the course of the year. (Which hopefully prevents students from just writing “My name is my name is my name is” over and over again.) If you have to take grades with certain frequencies, you can just set a very low goal for students to reach and then give them a good grade if they reach it, with gradations below that goal.\n\nAt this point, I distribute the ~special paper and tell students not to start yet, but to put their name, the period, and the date on the paper.\n\nFor the first Focus Write, I reread the prompt in L1, and then think aloud about how I might answer the prompt myself. As in, “(L1) Hmm, introduce yourself in German…(L2) My name is Herr Fisher-Rodriguez, I’m 33 years old, I am from California but I live in Washington… (etc etc).” In input-focused classrooms, students can sometimes get nervous about output, and might just need reminders of the kinds of things they certainly already feel comfortable writing about.\n\nThen, I set the timer…and let them have at it! I usually just observe students as they write, prompting slow starters with ideas or inspiration, if needed.\n\nAfter the five minutes are up, I compliment my students about how smart and awesome they are! I usually say something to the effect of, “I was reading what y’all were writing, and it looked really great and right on target!”\n\nFor the 2nd-5th Focus Writes, I just remind students that they have done this (successfully!) before, and that this is just a chance to show off what they’ve learned since the last time we did this. My encouragement is to just beat their own previous records!\n\nWhat do I do with it now that we’ve finished?\n\nAs mentioned above, I usually grade these fairly gently, mostly looking for growth over time. Follow your heart (read: the specific context of your job) for how to grade these, but remember that output grows so much more slowly than comprehension, and be realistic with your expectations.\n\nReading student writing (made simpler by only having them write for 5 minutes, HELLO) can also reveal what structures have really “stuck,” and which might need some more input. For example, maybe your students need more exposure to numbers and talking about age, so you can just make sure that any future input also includes ages, as appropriate. Marking things up with a red pen won’t do as much for their writing proficiency as just reading more, so provide lots of opportunities to read rich, comprehensible texts!\n\nI keep a portfolio of my students’ “major works” from their entire time with me (Free Writes, Focus Writes, tests, reflections, etc.), so each Focus Write gets filed into their portfolio. What’s fun is later pulling them out, and calculating their percentage growth. Getting to tell a kid that they’ve increased their 5 minute writing output by 200% is a great feeling for everyone.\n\nPro Tips!\n\nDecide on your topics! These may be determined by your district’s curriculum, or alignment with some outside source. Then, no matter what you do throughout the year, you can remind yourself to orient class conversations toward those topics as you move along. Maybe you add in some breakfast/lunch/dinner conversations to your opening routines, or characters in your stories just so happen to extensively describe their friends and family. There is flexibility in the “how” in working towards the “what” here.\n\nModel! Write and Discuss is a great way to model the skills of writing, and guide students towards greater success while writing on a specific prompt. Slipping in a lesson similar to an upcoming Focus Write, and modeling the writing process can really help students be more successful.\n\nKeep them! Even if you don’t have portfolios for each student, demonstrating student growth back to students increases feelings of competence, which can increase student motivation. Make sure they get tucked away for future celebration.\n\nUse them! I used this one year as part of a Student Growth Goal during my evaluation cycle, and my evaluator was blown away by the data I was able to provide. Admin love to hear informed statements like, “these students I chose to focus on increased their 5 minute writing fluency by 100%, while also growing from using mostly Phrases (NM) to mostly using Simple Sentences (NH) with some Strings of Sentences (IL)!” Focus Writes provided both qualitative and quantitative data for these conversations. Check!\n\nDo other types of writing! This is just one way to elicit output from students – building diverse portfolios of student writing is essential for us to know what students have acquired, and what needs more input. I mostly focus on input for the first two years I have my students, so there is not a crazy amount of additional writing for them beyond Free Writes and Focus Writes, but variety is the spice of life!\n\nWhat if I want to learn more?\n\nThis original tweet by Profe Jackie Camacho is what inspired me to write this post, so check that out!\n\nWhat do you think? Do you feel ready to use Focus Writes? Comment below and send me any questions you might have!\n\nReflections from the 2023-2024 School Year\n\nI feel like I get a little bit better at teaching every year, and part of that has been through the process of reflection. I did a reflection at semester, so here are my end-of-year reflections!\n\nAnchor Everything to a Text\n\nI came to a realization this year that sometimes, my class conversations were just floating in the air as sound. We would talk about something for a little while, and move on. I trained with teachers who did non-targeted CI, so I’m used to “discovering” new language as its need comes up, and writing it on the board, or conveying it using all my other skills. But that language sometimes would get that one use, and then it was gone. In reading the blog of Lance Piantaggini, I really had an “oh!” moment when he wrote to “always anchor to a text.”\n\nStudents need to be exposed to all that same language that came up in the conversation in a written text. This way, they can see spellings, writing conventions, grammar in context, everything – and get double the input. The texts can come from Write and Discuss (which I always tell myself to do more of), Embedded Readings, class novels, whatever – but I need to be writing more text on the board and getting more texts into student hands. Because reading is what? Fundamental!\n\nWork the Language Even More – Gestures, New Readings, Parallel Texts\n\nThis reflection kind of comes from the previous one, which is that I could tell that sometimes, students just needed more meaningful reps on new language. I can work it more by incorporating more gestures (which I used to do more of and students would list as something they loved!), creating parallel texts of readings we’re doing, and trying to generate more cultural readings using the language we’ve been using in class recently. I’m really inspired by how SOMOS does this throughout its curriculum, and hope to create similar readings for my German classes as I continue to tinker with my homemade curriculum.\n\nChanging IPA-Like Tasks to Be More Input-Heavy/Contextualized\n\nI’ve been trying to find a good balance between teacher-created materials and unadapted materials to build students’ reading skills. The couple “IPA-style” tasks I did this year had mixed results, with some students totally shutting down. I think they need lots and lots of guidance and modeling, especially at the Novice level, to perform the tasks without my support. This means using more “authres” as Picture Talks, the final levels of Embedded Readings, etc. instead of being like “I know you can do it, here’s a thing!” (Sometimes, this happened this year because I was unexpectedly way more absent than anticipated and just had to throw something in front of my kids.)\n\nHomework…?\n\nI gave homework for the first time in my career this year (audience gasps). Results were mixed. I only gave it to my third/fourth year College in the High School class because It’s College and We Love Rigor, etc etc. As expected, some kids struggled to complete it and needed to stay in during our remediation period to do so. It was never worth tons of points relative to our in-class assessments, but it could still affect a student’s grade.\n\nI’m toying with the idea of assigning homework in a zero-point category, and telling students that completed homework will help you get points back on assessments. (While secretly not actually giving extra points, but the students just earning them because the homework would hopefully help them just do better on assessments anyways?) Not sure how I want to handle this yet. Kids appreciated being pushed to engage with German outside of class times, but I need to do more reflection with them about what they actually find motivating and helpful to do.\n\nFor what it’s worth, they LOVED this Real World Homework assignment. They learned a ton from it, and I got linked up to some cool stuff I may not have found on my own!\n\nEnergizing Brain Breaks vs. Centering Brain Breaks\n\nI managed to do more Brain Breaks this year, which was nice! It’s important to keep an eye on students’ energy and focus, and use Brain Breaks to get them back in the game, as necessary. And like…hopefully do it as a preventative measure instead of as a bail-out.\n\nThere is a big difference, I’ve found, between Energizing Brain Breaks and Centering Brain Breaks. My first period needed Energizing Brain Breaks to break out of the soporific morning doldrums. These are things like giving a certain number of high fives to other classmates, Rock Paper Scissors variations, spelling German words with their bodies, Peluche – anything that required quicker movement.\n\nMy after-lunch classes required Centering Brain Breaks. These could include mindful breathing, body percussion, TPR with body parts, trying to count as high as possible without two people saying the same number at the same time, etc. They had a LOT of energy that needed reining in, or a recommitment to focus at the end of the day. I’m going to continue to experiment with how different groups at different times of day respond to various Brain Breaks to see what works best for the mood!\n\nMore Knowledge of the World!\n\nI just read an interesting book called The Knowledge Deficit, which was about how a focus on reading strategies has left students without many of the resources they actually need to read successfully: broad knowledge of the world! I want German class to contribute to my students knowing tons more about how the world works, so I’m recommitting to teaching my students more about geography, history, art, music, important people, politics in other countries, etc. through the language so that they can be more successful in all their other classes. (And in life, as well!)\n\n…Less Spreading Myself Paper-Thin\n\nThis year kicked me in the butt. I missed more days of school this year than any other year in my career (including the year I got married and had a week of jury duty!). Part of the problem is my tendency to Do Everything. I want to continue to say yes to exciting opportunities, but also…say no to more.\n\nI have dropped a couple things from my plate after this school year, and my current plan is to not attend any state, regional, or national conferences this school year. (Something that will help is that due to budget constraints, my district has paused our PD fund for one year, so there will be no money to go anywhere, anyways.) This is going to be a huge change for me, but I’m hoping to use the time to reflect more, have a more balanced life outside of school, and get healthier. Again, this year was a lot.\n\nATTENTION.\n\nI saw a great video by Elicia Cárdenas recently where she threw a stuffed animal to a student and said, “Look! Because you were paying attention to me and the things I was saying, you could catch the stuffed animal. The stuffed animal is the new language. Now, if you’re not paying attention, you’re not going to be able to catch the stuffed animal, or the new language.” (And then she had a student pretend to not pay attention, and the stuffed animal bounced off of them as she threw it, and the class [and I] giggled.)\n\nYou only learn what you pay attention to. I have gotten better with time at channeling my students’ focus towards new language, and want to keep focusing on that as a goal for the coming year. This will mean better follow-through on my cell phone policy (one warning, then it goes into the German Cowboy Hat for safekeeping), more Brain Breaks as described above, and more discussion of how people learn languages successfully. All this, plus a healthy dose of modeling, should hopefully get us up to lots of attention in German class. (I also tell my students, hey, we don’t have homework because I want your complete attention here, so let’s make the most of it!)\n\nAlso important is What We Put Our Attention On. This is going to be learning things about our classmates, about the German-speaking world, and about the world in general. I, as the teacher, am going to try to limit how much attention I put into grading (because I hate it and it doesn’t help my students acquire anything), and comparing myself to other teachers. No time for that! Only time to be with my awesome teenagers and bask together in the beauty of the German language.\n\nAnd you? What are your reflections from this school year?\n\nLook Back, and Rest – A Reflection on Going Slowly\n\nI was watching a video reflection by another teacher recently, and the teacher remarked that they had recently made changes in their instruction to go even slower than they had been going. The payoff had been that all his students were showing incredible gains, just from the single change of going so much slower.\n\nGoing slower required the teacher to provide even more repetition of the language and content to be learned, and to check in with each individual student and have them describe what was happening in the Target Language. The contention of the teacher was that before, by just developing strong responses to whole-class questions, he had been going too fast, and leaving students behind. That even though he had been implementing a Comprehension-Based Communicative Approach, he had been achieving the same level of student frustration and skill stratification within his classes as he had seen with a traditional approach. I shuddered.\n\nFor some reason, I flashed to a German class I had taught to other teachers as part of a conference. The class was fun, upbeat, and developed its own in-jokes (in German!) pretty quickly. They were all language teachers, so they just seemed to understand how things “should” work.\n\nAnd there was one participant who wasn’t quite on the same ride as the rest of the class. She indicated that she didn’t understand as much of the language as she would like, and that some things were going over her head. She was more reserved than her classmates, and didn’t seem quite convinced that what we were doing was the right way for language teaching and acquisition.\n\nI found myself overlooking her, even somewhat consciously, and just enjoying the laughter and creativity of her classmates. The class moved right along, and we generated tons of content from all the various activities I know how to do that made some great memories for us all. I convinced myself that the choral responses of her classmates would help surround her with the information she needed to be successful, that it would all click into place, eventually. She was trying – surely she would get it!\n\nI look back now and feel sad that in a way, I gave up on her feeling successful in my German class. I had tried to repeat that “just getting the gist” was okay and totally where we all should be, but how much can one enjoy always just grasping at getting the gist? Especially while everyone else seems to “get it”? I can’t imagine how defeating, maybe embarrassing that felt. I wouldn’t be surprised if she didn’t turn around and start a Comprehension-Based Communicative Approach in her own classes, if she wasn’t already. I hadn’t really sold it to her. Success breeds confidence, and I had, in some part, withheld success from someone who was really trying.\n\nI flashed forward, then, to my own classes now. I was embarrassed to realize that I could quickly name students in each class that I give a similar “overlook” treatment. Their classes are moving along, we are “covering content,” some of their peers are outputting in alignment with my goals for them. But what about their goals? What about truly everyone being along for the ride so there are not clear “strugglers” in each class, ones that come to mind quickly?\n\nThe video I watched was a reminder to go slow, slower, even slower. I want to:\n\ncheck comprehension even more to ensure that everyone is along for the ride.\n\nlook into the faces of all my students as we engage in whole-class discussion.\n\nask more processing questions to make the language deeply part of each student, so they can enjoy it the same way that I do, that their peers do.\n\n“Just holding on by the skin of their teeth” for some of my students just doesn’t work for me, for the inclusive vision I have built for my entire German program. I am on a weeklong midwinter break as I write this, and will return with a plan to go slow, painfully slow, stick with students, try my hardest to make sure that every student is experiencing success. I know that it will be hard, but that these adjustments will end up making all my students feel stronger, more confident, more like the German speakers they want to be.\n\nAnother set of images flashed into my mind:\n\nFor five summers in my twenties, I was the program director of an outdoors summer camp. Every year, our staff included new counselors who, like me, had once been young campers at the same camp.\n\nReliably, these young staff members were thrilled at the speed at which they could hike with other adults, and would blaze ahead on the trail at grown-up speed. But that also meant that they were leaving slower hikers behind, hikers who were inexperienced rock hoppers or who just needed an extra bit of time to get to the destination. When they would eventually catch up, the fastest hikers were finished resting and would power on, leaving the slower hikers out of breath and scrambling to follow.\n\nEventually, frustrated by how these trailblazers were burning up the stamina of their peers, and that they were missing out on opportunities to slow down and connect with their peers on a personal level, I decided to be the voice in their head that would encourage them to keep track of their slower peers. At intervals, I would shout up the trail: “look back!” Those in the front would turn to check that they could still see the furthest hiker back, and would adjust their pace to keep the group together.\n\nWhen we would stop to drink water or catch our breath, I reminded everyone, fast and slow, to rest. The idea was not for everyone to just stop breathing hard and double up protection against blisters, but to really be ready to conquer the next stretch of trail with confidence, connection, and enjoyment.\n\nWe saw so much more, hiking together. The mood was so much brighter, even if it took us longer to get to our destination. And the young staff members were so much better prepared for the real-world task of being able to accept whatever skills and speed their young campers brought to camp during the actual weeklong camping session.\n\nMaybe this is a good metaphor for what we must seek to do with our learners. Look back, and rest. If not, we run the risk of turning something as beautiful as the slow hike of language acquisition into a blur of exhaustion, isolation, and pain.\n\nGo slow, colleague. Slower than you think. Look back, and rest.\n\nUpcoming Webinar: The Personalization Mindset: Using Card Talk to Build Proficiency and Community\n\nI’m super excited to announce that I will be presenting a webinar for ACTFL on using Card Talk to personalize language learning, and build the skills of creating comprehensible input and interactions in your language classes!\n\nWho: The CCLT SIG and the German SIG (join for free if you are an ACTFL member!)\n\nWhat: The Personalization Mindset: Using Card Talk to Build Proficiency and Community\n\nWhen: March 4, 2024 from 4-5pm PST\n\nWhere: Online!
