It is also a risk factor for school dropout (2,3), which is associated with many long-term health impacts (4,5). This report uses data from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to describe the percentage of children ages 5‒17 who experienced chronic school absenteeism due to illness, injury, or disability by sociodemographic and health factors.\n\nKeywords: missed school days, disability, education, National Health Interview Survey\n\nWhat was the percentage of children who experienced chronic school absenteeism for health-related reasons in the past 12 months, and did it vary by sex or age group?\n\nIn 2022, 5.8% of children experienced chronic school absenteeism in the past 12 months (Figure 1, Table 1). Differences between boys (5.5%) and girls (6.0%) and by age were not significant.\n\nFigure 1.

Children with family incomes of less than 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) (7.9%) and those with family incomes of 100% to less than 200% FPL (7.4%) were more likely than those with family incomes of 200% FPL or more (4.7%) to have experienced chronic school absenteeism.\n\nFigure 2.

Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population.\n\nSOURCE: National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey, 2022.\n\nSummary\n\nIn 2022, 5.8% of children experienced chronic school absenteeism for health-related reasons in the past 12 months. Differences by sex and age were not significant. However, White (6.6%) and Hispanic (6.2%) children were more likely to have experienced chronic school absenteeism compared with Black (3.3%) and Asian (1.4%) children. Children living in households with family incomes of less than 200% FPL had a higher percentage of chronic school absenteeism compared with children living in households with higher family incomes. Chronic school absenteeism was higher among children with disabilities and those in fair or poor health.\n\nData from the National Center for Education Statistics School Pulse Panel, a survey of school leaders, indicate that student chronic absenteeism has generally increased since the COVID-19 pandemic (6). NHIS is a large and nationally representative survey that can be used to highlight subgroup differences in chronic school absenteeism according to sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and disability status.\n\nDefinitions\n\nChronic school absenteeism for health-related reasons: Categorized based on the survey question, “During the past 12 months, about how many days of school did [Sample Child] miss school because they had an illness, injury, or disability?” Responses of 15 or more days were categorized as chronic school absenteeism based on the U.S. Department of Education definition (7).\n\nDisability status: Defined by the reported level of difficulty (no difficulty, some difficulty, a lot of difficulty, or cannot do at all/unable to do) in 13 core functioning domains: 1) seeing, 2) hearing, 3) mobility, 4) self-care, 5) communication, 6) learning, 7) remembering, 8) concentrating, 9) accepting change, 10) controlling behavior, 11) making friends, 12) anxiety, and 13) depression. Children who were reported to have “a lot of difficulty” or “cannot do at all” to at least one of the domains (1‒11) or “daily” (domains 12 or 13) are classified in the “with disabilities” category. Children with “no difficulty” or “some difficulty” to all domains 1‒11 and “never” or “a few times a year” or “monthly” or “weekly” to domains 12 and 13 are classified in the “without disabilities” category.\n\nFamily income as a percentage of FPL: Based on the ratio of a family’s income in the previous calendar year to the appropriate poverty threshold (given a family’s size and number of children) defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (8). Family income was imputed when missing using the 2022 NHIS imputed income files (9).\n\nRace and Hispanic origin: Categories shown for non-Hispanic children are for those who selected only one racial group; respondents had the option to select more than one racial group. Children categorized as Hispanic may be of any race or combination of races. Estimates for non-Hispanic children of races other than White only, Black only, or Asian only are not shown but are included in total estimates.\n\nData source and methods\n\nData from the 2022 NHIS Sample Child interview (n = 7,464) were used for this analysis. NHIS is a nationally representative household survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. It is conducted continuously throughout the year by the National Center for Health Statistics. Interviews are typically conducted in respondents’ homes, but follow-ups to complete interviews may be conducted over the telephone. Data collection procedures were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and during 2022, 56.1% of Sample Child interviews were conducted at least partially by telephone (10). For more information about NHIS, visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm.\n\nPoint estimates and the corresponding confidence intervals were calculated using SAS-callable SUDAAN software (11) to account for the complex sample design of NHIS. Linear and quadratic trends by age group and family income were evaluated using orthogonal polynomials in logistic regression; when trends were not significant, pairwise comparisons were also tested. All estimates are based on parent or guardian report and meet National Center for Health Statistics data presentation standards for proportions (12). Differences between percentages were evaluated using two-sided significance tests at the 0.05 level.\n\nAbout the authors\n\nLindsey I.
