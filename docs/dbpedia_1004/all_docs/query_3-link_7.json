Once you upload data, the tool compares the distribution of the uploaded data with the distribution of baseline variables from the ACS.\n\nFor the map, we construct geographic disparity scores by taking the difference between the percentage of the data and the percentage of the selected baseline population that falls into each state (national-level tool), county (state-level tool), or tract (county- and city-level tool).\n\nFor the demographic disparity chart, we first estimate the demographic groups your data depicts by taking a weighted average of the demographics across all the tracts your data come from. We compare that average with the overall demographics of the selected baseline population and report the difference as the demographic disparity score. See our documentation for more details.\n\nWe use the ACS formulas to calculate 95 percent confidence intervals for both the geographic and the demographic disparity scores. If the interval contains zero, we mark that disparity as not statistically significant. For more information about the specific methodology and variables used and how they vary by geography, please see the documentation.\n\nFor the demographic disparity chart, we use âLatinxâ to refer to people of Latino or Hispanic origin as asked by the census. We recognize that this gender-neutral term may not be the preferred identifier for many, but we use it to remain inclusive of gender nonconforming and nonbinary people. The regions users may select on the chart correspond to US census regions.\n\nFor the national-level tool, we use ânationalâ to refer to the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. We realize this excludes US territories from analysis and hope to include them in future iterations of this tool.\n\nFor more information about our sample datasets, see our entry in Urban Instituteâs Data Catalog.\n\nTo learn more about the public Application Programming Interface (API) for the tool, see our API Documentation.\n\nFor help using this tool, contact [email protected].\n\nErrata: We corrected this tool on March 19, 2024, to address an error in the American Community Survey (ACS) variable codes used to pull race and ethnicity data. This error was introduced on March 6 when we updated the tool to use the 2018â22 five-year ACS data. As a result, between March 6 and March 19 the race and ethnicity group results in the demographic disparity score chart for the total population baseline were incorrect.\n\nProject credits\n\nThis feature was originally funded in collaboration with the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth.
