        "meta_description": "This fact sheet offers an overview of the situation of the English language in Quebec in 2021, along with certain trends observed since 1991. It provides information on the changes in the number and proportion of people in the population who can conduct a conversation in English, whose first official language spoken is English, whose mother tongue is English, and who speak English at home or use English at work. In addition, it contains information on English-language instruction in elementary and secondary schools, on English spoken among recent and established immigrants, as well as on the mobility and place of birth of individuals whose first official language spoken is English. This fact sheet is based on data from the 1991 to 2021 censuses of population, together with the 2011 National Household Survey.",
