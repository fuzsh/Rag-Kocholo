        "text": "Graduated in Pharmaceutical Sciences at Faculdade de Farmácia da Universidade do Porto in 2010, I completed my PhD degree in Pharmacy – Microbiology Specialty in the same institution in July 2017. The work performed during my PhD sought to elucidate the molecular basis for the expansion of main multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens (especially Klebsiella pneumoniae) by a multidisciplinary approach including conventional genotypic, phenotypic, and molecular tools and some of the most cutting-edge high-throughput omics (genomics, metabolomics, proteomics) approaches. On the behalf of my PhD, I have been awarded with the Young Investigation Award – Isabel Spencer Martins by Portuguese Society of Microbiology in 2017. I have joined the BEBP Uunit at Institut Pasteur in 2018, to work as a postdoctoral researcher on the MEDVETKLEBS project. This project aimed to develop and harmonize detection and strain culture methods for K. pneumoniae, organise broad sampling of ecological niches and of potential sources of this bacterium in order to perform genomics analysis and transmission modeling, including development of new methods for source attribution and risk assessment. In January 2023, I have joined the NRC of whooping cough and other Bordetella infections, hosted in the BEBP unit, as deputy director."
