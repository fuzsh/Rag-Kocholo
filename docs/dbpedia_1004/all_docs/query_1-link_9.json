        "text": "Confusing I know…Rodriguez is part of the Republic of Mauritius but they do not necessarily consider themselves “Mauritius people”…rather they are from “Rodrig” (Creole for Rodriguez). So don’t do what I did and call them “Mauritian”…that is a big “no-no”. But after spending 3 weeks in Rodrig and now currently on Mauritius island, we have a slight understanding of the difference between Rodriguez and Mauritius islands (the people, the culture)…even though they are technically the same country.\n\nRodriguez is such a cool and relaxed place with a unique history and a strong identity. From the Chinese owner at the mini mart to the local DHL office to the manager at the post office we were helped in every way they could. Having been in other island nations where France has left it’s mark (not a good or a bad thing) but never been to France ourselves, we have observed that people may come across as “rude” at first…but as soon as you break through…it’s all smiles and Bonjour’s in Rodrig!\n\nI won’t bore you with my version of history and cool fun facts so I found a quick summary in the link below:\n\nhttps://mauritiusattractions.com/rodrigues-island-i-37.html\n\nok…I can’t resist…just a few of our observations and things we were told about the place:\n\nI saw women wearing high heels!!!! We are no longer in the land of covered shoulders or knees and women wear what they want (there is a small Muslim population here but not as significant as in the Maldives)\n\nTown closes around 4 pm, but most people are up at 4-5 am\n\nLunch is at 11am…not noon like in the US\n\nTrevor fell in love with a green chili paste here..should of bought more!\n\nThe honey of Rodrig is known internationally for having won twice a silver medal at the London National Honey Show (source…is from the above website it was so cool I had to share)\n\n“The supply ship is really full of beer when it comes into port….and leaves with garbage”\n\nHealthcare is free\n\nEducation is free (though there are private schools)\n\nWe were told after being a Mauritian citizen for 5 years, you receive a plot of land for FREE!\n\nThe endemic flightless bird, the Solitaire, has been extinct since about 1730’s as it was an easy “catch” for settlers\n\nThe Giant Tortoise was traded as food on ships because they could be kept on board easily and stay alive with minimal effort…making it easy for the cook\n\nThe coral reefs are self-seeding which means these reefs do not receive other nutrients other than it’s own due to Rodriguez’s remoteness in the Indian Ocean\n\nEvery day/night, depending on the tides, people would hunt for octopus on the reef just behind the anchorage\n\nAt least 5 different people “warned” us about theft and pickpockets on Mauritius island and told us to be careful when shopping in the markets and at the marina\n\nRodrigians are very proud people of their island!\n\nTour of the town ….\n\nLet’s get a tour out of the way before we get into the fun : )\n\nMap of Authorities\n\nMap of Services\n\nMap of Shopping and Restaurants\n\nAnd the fun begins!!!!!\n\nFor us, we stayed on our boat quite a bit as the winds were strong and we were not quite sure of the how our anchor was holding and we generally had 1 person stay on board just in case…but when we both felt safe to leave the boat and especially when the winds calmed down for a few days at a time…we were off to adventure! But first up…we had to get everyone together and meet our new friends so we had an impromptu happy hour on Slow Flight to get to know everyone the first chance we got!\n\nOne of the highlights was our hike we took with Neptune’s Highway (Bruce and Laura).\n\nThe bus is always a great way to see an island as it’s slow enough and stops enough to get a glimpse of everyday life. Plus it’s cheap! The buses stop running all around the island about 4pm (not really a written schedule) so it’s best to catch the bus around 3 or so to make sure you aren’t stuck somewhere (LOL).\n\nThe hike took about 4 or so hours and that included a nice long stop for lunch. I have no idea how many miles/km we walked but we all did a nice easy pace and didn’t feel rushed. This coastal hike we saw some beautiful secluded beaches and being on the windward side of the island we got to see jagged volcanic rock.\n\nHere are a few fun finds along the trail…yes I was very far behind the group taking random photos : )\n\nWell you never know who you are going to meet….Laura met Tino, who plays in a local band and plays traditional Rodrigian music, on the bus heading to our hike. Tino said he and his band, were playing at a resort near Port Mathurin that weekend. We had no idea what to expect …but …. I am sure you can guess what happened next : )\n\nSV Mirari, Iker and Noemi from Spain, had us over for dinner with a traditional Spanish “one pot” meal, fancy appetizers, and dessert! So we were happy to reciprocate on Slow Flight. It’s not to often for us to find cruising boats who are near our age group so we marveled in their energy and we hope to see them again in Reunion : )\n\nMeet Harry! Harry was the first person we met as he helped us with our lines as we came into Port Mathurin. He has worked for the Mauritius Port Authority (MPA) for decades and is up for retirement in about 5 years. He is married. His wife and his daughter, who is receiving her university education, live on the island of Mauritius and visits often. Harry has traveled to many countries and we specifically spoke about his most recent trip to China last year. He is defiantly adventurous as I can’t even image going to China, by myself, not knowing the language like he did…but he loved it! We would see Harry every time we took our dinghy in as he stays on the tug boats so we would chat it up often. He asked us to lunch one day…we were honored!\n\nBon Jour….. Bonsoir….Merci….Voiala….Parlez vous Angles?.…this is the extent of our the French language Trevor and I have….mind you this is not enough! Even though the republic of Mauritius (that includes Rodriguez) has been independent from France since 1986, French is still spoken A LOT! Creole is the local language and is spoken when the conversation is not “business”. English is taught in schools so many people do speak English, but learning to speak French is defiantly advantageous!\n\nLouise on SV C. Coquin is from Quebec (French speaking) and luckily for us, she offered all of us a few hours (we came prepared with beers of course) ! We all boarded SV Neptune’s Highway with SV Mirari (Spanish) one afternoon… we are still practicing!\n\nOne of our last group adventures was our visit to the Tortoise park. Touristy….yes…still a bundle of fun…oh yeah! They are very proud of their work here…as they should be! Some of the information I provided is from the nature reserve’s website in the link below. Check it out!\n\nhttp://www.tortoisescavereserve-rodrigues.com/en/tortoises\n\nLet the tour begin!!! I could of put up hundreds of photos and videos….these “few” will have to do : )\n\nThe Grand Caverne tour, in which we needed the hard hats for, was well equipped with walkways, steps and lighting and is the only electrified ‘Show Cave’ in the south-west Indian Ocean. As part of the caves tour, we saw the limestone plateau, called Plaine Corail. This unique area was created by the wind blowing coral through the limestone rocks.\n\nAfter the tour was over, we enjoyed a relaxing lunch at the reserves cafe, toured the museum, and shopped at the little store.\n\nAfter we returned the truck from our day adventure at the Tortoise Natural reserve, we all unanimously agreed thought we would should finish our day with a few beers at the local “bar”, Madame Marcel….unsavory meets “unsavory” (LOL)!\n\nThe most interesting thing happened: When we arrived, there were only a few locals there. When 4 pm came around, remember this is when the work day ends, the place started to filled up. The beers went down faster and we all found ourselves chatting it up with the locals about who we were and where we all came from. One guy came in and sat right next to us and almost immediately the owner asked him to leave us alone. We didn’t think a thing about it and expressed that “he” was fine to sit with us and saw it as a nice gesture of the manager who we thought was trying to let us enjoy our time by ourselves….\n\n…..Until a man named Hughes (also drinking in the bar) pulled me aside and told me “he” was not a good man…Hughes also invited us to his house for dinner…we had to decline because we had plans and were getting ready to leave port. Additionally, another guy who was a police officer, pulled Trevor aside and told Trevor the same message. The kicker was when Louise was paying the bill, the owner told her as well that he was not a good person and to be careful not to give him too much information about ourselves.\n\nWe have NEVER experienced this type of self-policing or felt so protected by complete strangers…I mean seriously, why would this community (in a bar mind you) give 3 separate attempts to warn 5 tourists of 1 guy who may want to steal something or get some money from us?….it is curious and interesting so I asked Hughes. He said he personally didn’t want people to think badly of Rodriguez and their people. He said he wanted us to have a good time and feel safe. I didn’t know what to say besides “thank you” and we greatly appreciated EVERYONE looking out for us…..just WOW!\n\nThis act of kindness really speaks to how fiercely proud they are to be Rodrigian…and it shows…and we love it!\n\nOur last night we were invited to dinner at Geroges and Valerie Ponnan’s house, the owners of my favorite pizza place, Point Chaud. I am missing a photo of them (they are adorable together!) as I usually get a selfie or something documented but we were having such a great time (Rose wine was involved) I totally forgot! We didn’t arrive back to the boat until just before midnight….we were slightly hungover for the passage but totally worth it!\n\nThough things have maybe been lost in translation but we know that Goerges is Mauritian and met Valerie in Paris. They have been married for years in France with a flat 5 blocks from Notre Dame (we looked it up on Google maps). They or he spent time in Alsace, France where we think he perfected his pizza recipe…it is to die for! We believe Valerie was married before and has 2 kids, still living in their flat in Paris. Their restaurant, Point Chaud, in Port Mathurin has been open for 2 years now. They were telling us they prefer Rodrig over Mauritius island for it’s relaxed culture, but owning a business in a small community has it’s challenges. We even spoke about us flying back to Rodrig to help out in their restaurant during busy season which is between mid-December to beginning of January. They offered their home to stay in if we came back…hummm…maybe…we need to learn French quick!\n\nThe view from their balcony….stunning!\n\nWell…the next day it was time to leave…a bit hungover…but totally worth it!\n\nNext up….Passage from Rodriguez to Mauritius…\n\nRelated"
