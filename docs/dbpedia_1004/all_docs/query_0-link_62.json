        "meta_description": "Study question What effect on body mass index, obesity and diabetes can we expect from the 1-peso-per-litre tax to sugar sweetened beverages in Mexico?   Methods Using recently published estimates of the reductions in beverage purchases due to the tax, we modelled its expected long-term impacts on body mass index (BMI), obesity and diabetes. Microsimulations based on a nationally representative dataset were used to estimate the impact of the tax on BMI and obesity. A Markov population model, built upon an age-period-cohort model of diabetes incidence, was used to estimate the impact on diagnosed diabetes in Mexico. To analyse the potential of tax increases we also modelled a 2-peso-per-litre tax scenario.   Study answer and limitations Ten years after the implementation of the tax, we expect an average reduction of 0.15 kg/m2 per person, which translates into a 2.54% reduction in obesity prevalence. People in the lowest level of socioeconomic status and those between 20 and 35 years of age showed the largest reductions in BMI and overweight and obesity prevalence. Simulations show that by 2030, under the current implementation of 1-peso-per-litre, the tax would prevent 86 to 134 thousand cases of diabetes. Overall, the 2-peso-per-litre scenario is expected to produce twice as much of a reduction. These estimates assume the tax effect on consumption remains stable over time. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of findings; similar results were obtained with various parameter assumptions and alternative modelling approaches.   What this study adds The sugar-sweetened beverages tax in Mexico is expected to produce sizable and sustained reductions in obesity and diabetes. Increasing the tax could produce larger benefits. While encouraging, estimates will need to be updated once data on direct changes in consumption becomes available.",

        "text": "Results\n\nTable 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the population by quartiles of SSB consumption. Overall, 30.38% had normal weight, 35.57% were overweight and 34.05% were obese. Obesity prevalence was higher among individuals in the third (36.43%) and fourth (36.94%) quartiles of SSB consumption. Females accounted for 55.13% of the expanded sample; the proportion of females was smaller in the highest quartiles of SSB consumption (66.5% in Q1, 43.2% in Q4). Participants younger than 40 years represented 47.21% of the sample, with 34.20% between 40 and 59 years, and 18.59% having 60 years and over. A larger proportion of young adults was observed among heavier consumers (58.96% in the fourth quartile).\n\nENSANUT 2012.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176336.t001\n\nTable 2 presents the average SSB consumption and caloric intake at baseline and the expected reduction after the implementation of the tax. The average SSB consumption was 323.49 ml/person/day, which translates into 125.50 kcal/person/day. Considering the average tax effect, SSB consumption was expected to decrease by 21.62 ml/person/day (8.38 kcal/person/day). The peak monthly tax effect would produce larger decreases in SSB consumption (40.18 ml/person/day, 15.56 kcal/person/day). Under the hypothetical 20% tax the average effect would produce a 43.23 ml/person/day reduction (16.75 kcal/person/day) and the peak monthly effect an 80.35 ml/person/day (31.13 kcal/person/day) reduction.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176336.t002\n\nTable 3 presents the expected BMI change 10 years after the implementation of the tax. For the overall population the starting BMI was 28.40 kg/m2, decreasing 0.15 kg/m2 under average and 0.29 kg/m2 under peak monthly tax effects (0.31 and 0.57 kg/m2 for the 20% tax). Baseline BMI was higher among high-SES participants, yet low-SES participants experienced larger BMI reductions than all others (0.20 kg/m2 and 0.37 kg/m2 for average and peak monthly effect, respectively). Younger adults showed the largest reduction in BMI; the 10% tax increase would induce a 0.18 kg/m2 reduction under average and 0.33 kg/m2 under peak monthly tax effect. BMI was similar across quartiles of SSB consumption; the tax had no effect in the first quartile of consumption, but it is expected to produce a reduction of 0.45 kg/m2 and 0.84 kg/m2 for the average and peak monthly effects among those in the fourth quartile (0.90 kg/m2 and 1.66 kg/m2 under a 20% tax). Similar patterns were observed for men and women, with the exception of SES: in men the tax produced larger BMI decreases in those of lower SES, yet in women the trend was small and only appeared for the average but not for the peak monthly effect. Fully stratified tables including initial BMI, expected BMI change at 1 and 10 years are included in (S1 File, Table S1 (all adults), Table S2 (males) and Table S3 (females)).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176336.t003\n\nProjected changes in the prevalence of overweight and obesity are presented in Table 4. At baseline 30.38% of participants had normal weight, 35.57% were overweight and 34.05% obese. After 10 years, under the average tax effect the simulations indicate that the prevalence of obesity would decrease by 2.54%, while overweight and normal weight would increase 0.51% and 2.25%, respectively. Under the peak monthly tax effect, obesity prevalence would decrease by 6.38%, while overweight (0.42%), and normal weight (6.66%) would increase. Larger decreases in obesity and overweight are expected for the 20% tax under average tax effect, with a net increase in the prevalence of normal weight of 6.90%, (12.95% under peak monthly tax effect). The impact of the tax increases with baseline SSB consumption: in the first quartile the impact is null, but in the fourth quartile the average tax effect is expected to decrease the prevalence of obesity by 7.33% (18.26% under peak monthly tax effect), and increase overweight (3.23% average, 1.98% peak monthly), and normal weight (5.25% average, 18.60% peak monthly).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176336.t004\n\nTable 5 presents projections of diagnosed diabetes prevalence and averted cases by 2030 and 2050 under the 10% and 20% tax for average and peak monthly effect scenarios. The ranges capture the variability associated with the three future diabetes incidence assumptions. By 2050, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in adults (20 or older) is projected to be 13.6% to 22.5%. Under the average effect of the 10% tax, diabetes prevalence would decrease in 2050 to 13.4% to 22.2% (13.3% to 22.2% assuming the peak monthly effect). These changes would translate into 86K to 134K averted cases by 2030 under average and 161K to 251K averted cases under peak monthly effect. These would increase to 225K to 324K averted cases by 2050 under the average effect, and 421K to 605K under the peak monthly effect. The hypothetical 20% tax would produce further reductions of diabetes prevalence, as it roughly duplicates the number of prevented cases. S3 Fig in S1 File shows projected annual diagnosed diabetes prevalence and the annual number of averted cases for all tax scenarios from 2015–2050 under the intermediate incidence assumption.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0176336.t005\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study estimated the expected changes in BMI and the prevalence of overweight, obesity and diabetes in Mexican adults after the implementation of the 1-peso-per-litre tax to SSB in Mexico and under a hypothetical 20% tax scenario. Considering the 6.1% reduction in SSB purchases observed in 2014, after 10 years of implementation, the tax is expected to reduce an average 0.15 kg/m2 per person; the 20% tax would induce an average reduction of 0.31 kg/m2 per person. These BMI reductions would translate into sizable changes in the prevalence of obesity: 2.54% with respect to baseline for the 10% tax, and 6.85% for the 20% scenario. As for diabetes, we project that the 10% tax would prevent 86K-134K cases by year 2030, compared to 171K-267K cases with a 20% tax.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first projection of the potential health impact of a nation-wide SSB tax based on observed changes in SSB purchases after tax implementation. While the 0.15 kg/m2 reduction achieved with the tax could seem small from an individual level perspective, achieving this reduction at the population level with a single intervention is relevant, as it translates into a 2.54% reduction in the obesity prevalence 10 years after the tax; further reductions are expected among heavy consumers (7.33% lower prevalence of obesity). Our simulations also shed light on two important aspects of the tax. First, SSB consumption is concentrated in the younger age groups who benefit the most from the tax in terms of caloric and BMI reductions. This trend was observed for both men and women. BMI reductions earlier in life are likely to offer important health benefits throughout the life course, such as lower incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.[43–45] Also, as S1 File Tables S1 to S3 show, larger reductions in BMI were observed at lower SES levels for men and in most scenarios for women. The finding that larger declines in BMI were observed in the low SES is important. It means that the benefits derived from the reduction in purchases due to the tax favours the poorer households in terms of lower risks of obesity and chronic diseases in the medium and long run, which translates into savings due to reductions in medical attention and gains in productivity.\n\nSugar-sweetened beverages are major drivers of diabetes in Mexico.[46] According to our projections under an intermediate incidence scenario 14.9% of the population would be diagnosed with diabetes by 2050; the average effect of the 10% tax could avert 240K cases (1.3% change in prevalence). However, if the peak monthly effect of 2014 was to be maintained, averted cases could amount to 448K (2.0% change in prevalence). According to our estimates the 20% tax could duplicate the benefits of the current tax. This finding goes in the same direction as simulation studies from low and middle-income countries, such as India (-1.6% incidence in 10 years under a hypothetical 20% tax) and South Africa (-4% prevalence over 20 years with a hypothetical 20% tax).[19,23] Similar findings have been reported in Australia and the United States of America.[24,47] A recent study by Sanchez-Romero, et al., estimated the expected effect of the SSB tax in Mexico on cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[25] Assuming that the tax would translate in a 10% reduction in consumption with 39% compensation, from 2013 to 2022 they estimated 189K fewer diabetes cases, 20K fewer stroke and myocardial infarction cases, and 19K fewer deaths. The only common outcome to our study is diabetes but scenarios have substantial differences. In their no substitution scenario, Sanchez-Romero, et al., projected 265K (220-300K) fewer diabetes cases from 2013 to 2022 (26.5/year in average); in contrast, under the 12% reduction scenario, from 2015 to 2030 we project 173K (160-250K) prevented diagnosed diabetes cases. Assuming that in 2012 35% diabetes cases were undiagnosed that would roughly take us to 233K in 2030 (14.6K/year). Thus, they estimate twice as much of a reduction. However, these projections are not directly comparable, because of important differences in model assumptions. In particular, Sanchez-Romero, et al., modeled the incidence of total diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed) based on a risk model developed for the US population (the Framingham diabetes risk model).[25] In contrast, our projections are based on age-specific incidence of diagnosed diabetes estimated directly from the Mexican population.[40] Sources to estimate total diabetes projections based in Mexican data are not yet available,[40] future studies will need to refine these estimates once data becomes available. Despite differences, both models suggest that the tax could have a considerable impact to reduce the projected burden of diabetes in Mexico. As the prevalence of diabetes increases in Mexico strong calls to find structural solutions to the diabetes epidemic have been made.[48] Our findings point towards the importance of reducing SSB consumption as a key part of an integral approach to diabetes prevention.\n\nMexico provides a particularly suitable environment to evaluate the potential impact of a SSB tax. SSB consumption and the prevalence of overweight, obesity and diabetes are very high; thus, reductions associated to a decrease in SSB consumption should be more evident than in countries with lower SSB consumption. Our expected caloric decrease is larger than what models in countries such as the UK, India and Ireland have found, and similar to estimates from the US. A 10% tax would induce a 2.1 kcal/person/day decrease in Ireland, 4.0 kcal/person/day in UK, 4.3 kcal/person/day in India, and 18.0 kcal/person/day in the US;[19–22] in comparison, we estimated a decrease of 8.38 kcal/person/day in Mexico after the 10% tax using the average decrease observed in 2014. Differences in caloric reduction depend on multiple factors, such as SSB baseline consumption, SSB caloric content, price elasticity and caloric substitution based on availability of substitutes in each country.\n\nThe 1-peso-per-litre tax is an excise tax, only affecting industrialized drinks with sugar and with no effect over homemade beverages. According to our data, Mexicans consume 189 kcals/day from SSB, yet, our simulation is based only on industrialized drinks, which represent 66.4% of the SSB caloric intake. This is a major difference compared to other studies, which have modelled caloric and weight reductions associated to all SSB. Thus, average caloric intake from SSB in the UK has been estimated on 29.4 kcal/person/day, India 46 kcal/person/day, and 153 kcal/person/day in the US.[20–22] The definition of SSB presented in previous studies assume a tax that affects both homemade and industrialized SSB, which would require a tax to sugar, rather than to SSB. However, such tax would be difficult to implement, as it would simultaneously affect all industries and products that use sugar. This distinction is irrelevant for countries where homemade SSB are rare, but in countries like Mexico the exclusion of homemade SSB is important to avoid overestimation of the tax impact.\n\nOur study has important limitations. Our estimate of the tax effect is based on previous work based on purchase surveys.[18] We acknowledge that survey data may underestimate SSB purchases or consumption. However, a recent paper using aggregate sales data, collected by the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography, shows a 6.2% reduction of SSB sales in 2014,[49] a very similar result compared to the parameter used to estimate changes in consumption after the SSB tax was implemented of 6%. Also, our approach to estimate BMI change assumes substitution towards non-caloric alternatives. Yet, substitutions for other caloric beverages are unlikely for a number of reasons. Firstly, the SSB tax implemented in Mexico includes all beverages with added sugar, which reduces potential substitutions for caloric beverages. Secondly, two studies have found increases in untaxed beverages (beverages with no added sugar) after the tax was implemented. The first study used a panel of households and showed a 4% increase in purchases of untaxed beverages in 2014 (mainly bottled water).[18] The second study used aggregate sales data and found a 5.2% increase in sales of plain water manufactured by the beverage industry.[49] These findings suggest that after the tax the population substituted for untaxed beverages, mainly plain water. However, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we used estimates of the direct effect of SSB consumption changes in body weight (i.e., not through calorie mediation via the Hall Model) from studies that account for regular dietary substitution adjusting for simultaneous changes in other nutritional variables and from experimental studies that modified SSB consumption while allowing free-feeding for other foods. For the sensitivity analysis we used comparative risk assessment models, [50] rather than Hall and Chow’s model (details of the implementation of the sensitivity analysis available in S2 File Section 3). Using baseline weight as the comparison, we calculated the limits of the expected annual weight change after the tax using the average experimental and observational meta-analytical effects (0.85 kg/m2 per serving/day experimental, 0.22 kg/m2 per serving/day observational) estimated by Malik, et al.[51] Given the large heterogeneity observed in the meta-analysis of observational studies we also included the effects of three specific studies: the lowest (0.11 kg/m2 per serving/day for Mozaffarian),[52] middle (1.09 kg/m2 per serving/day for Chen)[53] and highest (2.12 kg/m2 per serving/day for Barone).[54] S4 Fig in S1 File presents expected BMI changes 10 years after the tax under different BMI change per SSB serving scenarios, assuming the average 6.1% decrease; all scenarios produce a decrease in BMI, and our estimate falls within the range of values produced using observational coefficients for BMI change and close to those generated with experimental coefficients. We estimated weight change using the Mexican population who participated in the ENSANUT 2012. Some participants had chronic diseases that could affect weight change over time, such as diabetes. Modeling disease-specific weight change rates is complex, and no data is available for the Mexican population; therefore, we had to assume that weight change was similar and properly captured by Hall’s model across the population. Chronic diseases tend to produce weight decreases, so our average estimate for weight after 10 years of the tax could be an underestimate of the expected population weight. This, however, will not necessarily affect the estimated weight impact of the tax, assuming that the benefits of reducing caloric intake from SSB are the same independently the health status of the people. This issue does not affect diabetes projections, since models are based on people with no diabetes at baseline.\n\nOur diabetes model is restricted to diagnosed diabetes, underestimating the potential tax effect on total diabetes. We did not consider total diabetes (undiagnosed and diagnosed cases), because there is no data available for Mexico, except for the ENSANUT-2006. Our model only considered adults, and no evaluation on children was conducted. Children are heavily targeted by the SSB industry and consume important quantities of SSB. Future efforts must be conducted to estimate the effect of SSB taxes on children, as they are likely to benefit the most from this policy.\n\nOur study also has several strengths. This is the first estimate using the observed effect of a nationwide excise tax to SSB; as such, it provides data and evidence that is closer to what other countries may experience if similar taxes are enforced. We provided estimates for both the average effect observed during 2014 (6.1% decrease) and the peak monthly effect recorded during that year (11.9% decrease); previous estimates of the elasticity of SSB suggested a 10% increase was expected to produce a 12.1% decrease in consumption, which is consistent with the observed value in December 2014. It is difficult to establish how long will it take for the tax to reach its stable effect. While we decided to present the more conservative 6.1% decrease, the 11.9% scenario is also likely. Our weight change analysis relied in nationally representative individual-level data, which allowed us to provide stratum-specific effects to evaluate potential differences in the expected effect of the tax. We used Chow and Hall’s dynamic weight-change model, which provides a closer resemblance to the physiological weight change process and has shown to produce valid estimates;[35–38] also, it has been widely used in the literature, among other things to model the impact of SSB taxes on weight change [39] allowing us to compare to previous estimates.[22,39] A common concern of implementing a SSB tax is that it could lead to larger and unhealthy BMI reductions among people in the lowest SES levels; by using SES-specific elasticities and data we showed such concerns are unsubstantiated as both high and low SES people experienced similar BMI reductions. We used a diabetes model that is based on the Mexican trajectories of diagnosed diabetes, providing locally grounded information of future trends and prevented cases due to the tax."
