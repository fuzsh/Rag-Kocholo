        "text": "Cristian Espinoza notched two assists on Saturday, marking his third multi-assist game of the season. In a performance that earned him Man of the Match honors presented by Coors Light, Espinoza would first find Rodrigues off a corner kick in the fifth minute. San Jose would double the advantage in the 55th minute when Espinoza fed Amahl Pellegrino for his second goal of the season. Four minutes later, another Espinoza corner kick found its way to the back of the net off an own goal by LAFCâs Denis Bouanga. Rodriguesâ aforementioned goal marked this third consecutive match where he either scored or collected an assist, as he also contributed to a back line that held the visitors scoreless for the first 69 minutes.\n\nThe MLS Team of the Matchday selection is the third of the season for Espinoza and 19th overall, and first of the season for Rodrigues (seventh overall). For Gonzalez, the Team of the Matchday honors are his first of the campaign and eighth overall in his career."
