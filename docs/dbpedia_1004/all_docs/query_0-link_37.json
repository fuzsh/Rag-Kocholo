        "text": "U.S. Supreme Court\n\nSan Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973)\n\nSan Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez\n\nNo. 71-1332\n\nArgued October 12, 1972\n\nDecided March 21, 1973\n\n411 U.S. 1\n\nSyllabus\n\nThe financing of public elementary and secondary schools in Texas is a product of state and local participation. Almost half of the revenues are derived from a largely state-funded program designed to provide a basic minimum educational offering in every school. Each district supplements state aid through an ad valorem tax on property within its jurisdiction. Appellees brought this class action on behalf of school children said to be members of poor families who reside in school districts having a low property tax base, making the claim that the Texas system's reliance on local property taxation favors the more affluent and violates equal protection requirements because of substantial inter-district disparities in per-pupil expenditures resulting primarily from differences in the value of assessable property among the districts. The District Court, finding that wealth is a \"suspect\" classification and that education is a \"fundamental\" right, concluded that the system could be upheld only upon a showing, which appellants failed to make, that there was a compelling state interest for the system. The court also concluded that appellants failed even to\n\nPage 412 U. S. 2\n\ndemonstrate a reasonable or rational basis for the State's system.\n\nHeld:\n\n1. This is not a proper case in which to examine a State's laws under standards of strict judicial scrutiny, since that test is reserved for cases involving laws that operate to the disadvantage of suspect classes or interfere with the exercise of fundamental rights and liberties explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution. Pp. 411 U. S. 18-44.\n\n(a) The Texas system does not disadvantage any suspect class. It has not been shown to discriminate against any definable class of \"poor\" people or to occasion discriminations depending on the relative wealth of the families in any district. And, insofar as the financing system disadvantages those who, disregarding their individual income characteristics, reside in comparatively poor school districts, the resulting class cannot be said to be suspect. Pp. 411 U. S. 18-28.\n\n(b) Nor does the Texas school financing system impermissibly interfere with the exercise of a \"fundamental\" right or liberty. Though education is one of the most important services performed by the State, it is not within the limited category of rights recognized by this Court as guaranteed by the Constitution. Even if some identifiable quantum of education is arguably entitled to constitutional protection to make meaningful the exercise of other constitutional rights, here there is no showing that the Texas system fails to provide the basic minimal skills necessary for that purpose. Pp. 411 U. S. 29-39.\n\n(c) Moreover, this is an inappropriate case in which to invoke strict scrutiny, since it involves the most delicate and difficult questions of local taxation, fiscal planning, educational policy, and federalism, considerations counseling a more restrained form of review. Pp. 411 U. S. 40-44.\n\n2. The Texas system does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Though concededly imperfect, the system bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. While assuring a basic education for every child in the State, it permits and encourages participation in and significant control of each district's schools at the local level. Pp. 411 U. S. 44-53.\n\n337 F. Supp. 280, reversed.\n\nPOWELL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER, C.J., and STEWART, BLACKMUN, and REHNQUIST, JJ., joined.\n\nPage 411 U. S. 3\n\nSTEWART, J., filed a concurring opinion, post, p. 411 U. S. 59. BRENNAN, J., filed a dissenting opinion, post, p. 411 U. S. 62. WHITE, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which DOUGLAS and BRENNAN, JJ., joined, post, p. 411 U. S. 63. MARSHALL, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which DOUGLAS, J., joined, post, p. 411 U. S. 70."
