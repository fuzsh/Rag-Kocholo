        "text": "B.A., City College, CUNY\n\nM.A., Cornell University\n\nPh.D., Washington University in St. Louis\n\nMy research interests and projects are wide-ranging, but they generally all involve racial/ethnic classifications, the media, and Latinos.\n\nIn the race/ethnicity area, I am currently working on the following research projects: (1) a review of the research, trends and emerging issues of two important areas: (a) how and why Latinos report their race on the census, in surveys and in more qualitative studies, i.e., the factors influencing Latino racial reporting and classification in the US. (b) how “race,” skin color and/or phenotype operate as stratifying agents among Latinos in the US (2) I hope to continue my research analyzing early decennial censuses classifications, i.e., those from 1790-1840.\n\nIn the media area, I am continuing my work on Demographic Change and the Media. The research questions I am pursuing in this area are the following: Is there a dissonance between what is reflected in our popular media and our changing demographic reality? To what extent is the media that we export world-wide reflective of these demographic changes? In other words, do they present an accurate view of the U.S. population as it is today?\n\nAnd lastly, to what extent does the popular media of other industrialized countries – many of which are experiencing major change in their racial/ethnic demographic make-up – reflect their now more heterogeneous populations?\n\nI am also working with a group that is composed of researchers in Germany, and Latinos from the US and Mexico on a project entitled \"Latino Images for the 21st Century.\"\n\nDr. Clara E. Rodríguez is a Professor of Sociology at Fordham University's College at Lincoln Center. She is the author of numerous books including: Heroes, Lovers and Others (Washington, D.
