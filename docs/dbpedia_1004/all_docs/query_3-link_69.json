        "text": "At current rates only about a third of California 9th graders will earn a bachelor’s degree; lower college completion among Latino, Black, and low-income Californians exacerbates the state’s economic divide (Gao and Johnson 2017; Johnson and Cuellar Mejia 2020a). Dual enrollment, which provides opportunities for high school students to take college courses, is an important way to expand educational opportunities, improve economic mobility, and meet the state’s workforce needs (Education Commission of the States 2019).\n\nA plethora of research shows that students benefit from dual enrollment in a variety of ways. Dual enrollment is associated with positive academic outcomes in both high school and college. For instance, participation in dual enrollment is linked to higher high school completion, college readiness, attendance, retention, and general academic achievement (Berger et al. 2014; Edmunds et. al 2015). Dual enrollment is also associated with higher levels of college enrollment and credit accumulation, as well as higher GPAs and higher overall achievement in college (An 2013; Berger et al. 2014; Edmunds et al. 2015; Giani et al. 2014; Allen and Dadgar 2012; Struhl and Vargas 2012; Fink, Jenkins, and Yanagiura 2017) In addition, dual enrollment improves the academic outcomes of students in career-focused programs, as well as the outcomes of students historically underrepresented in higher education (An 2013; Hooker et al. 2021; Karp et al. 2007; Rodriguez, Hughes, and Belfield 2012; Struhl and Vargas 2012).\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the promise of dual enrollment has not been fully realized in California. For a long time, California law limited the number of courses students could take per term and put caps on summer courses. In addition, colleges were not allowed to offer closed courses on high school campuses—instead, these courses needed to be open to the general college population and were often taught after school. A 2003 audit found community college districts improperly claimed as much as $36 million in state funds by enrolling high school students in physical education courses. Together, the limited access to course offerings and fiscal missteps limited the growth of dual enrollment in California (Faulkner, Vargas, and Hooker 2019).\n\nSeeking ways to improve intersegmental alignment and increase college access and equity, state leaders and legislators have passed a number of recent initiatives to expand dual enrollment programs (see text box). In 2015, Assembly Bill (AB) 288 established the College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) partnership, allowing community college districts to partner with K–12 districts in offering college classes exclusively to high school students on high school campuses. The goal of AB 288 is to provide dual enrollment opportunities to students who “may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education.” AB 30 (2019) extended the operation of CCAP partnerships to 2027 and simplified the application process by allowing students to submit only one parental consent form and principal recommendation, and complete one application for the duration of the CCAP partnership.\n\nTwo pieces of legislation—Senate Bill (SB) 379 (2013) and AB 413 (2019)—codified Early College High School (ECHS) and Middle College High School (MCHS) programs, which allow students to earn both a high school diploma and up to two years of college units. Like AB 288, AB 413 specified that MCHS programs provide a college and career preparatory curriculum to students who might not otherwise be served by dual enrollment—especially those who “are performing below their academic potential.”\n\nDual enrollment aligns well with the California Community College system’s Vision for Success, a set of goals and commitments that include boosting the numbers of students earning degrees or certificates and transferring to a University of California or California State University campus (Foundation for California Community Colleges 2019). A recent report issued by Governor’s Council for Post-Secondary Education—which outlines how California’s postsecondary systems can recover equitably from the pandemic—recommends an expansion of early college credit opportunities as a strategy that can help promote more equitable postsecondary access and completion (California Governor’s Council for Post-secondary Education 2021).\n\nRecent research by Wheelhouse (2020a) finds that the share of California high school students taking community college dual enrollment courses has increased over the past several years, from 11.3 percent of 2015–16 high school seniors to 18.2 percent in 2018–19. While research shows that there are racial/ethnic and socioeconomic gaps in access (Wheelhouse 2020b), little is known about access and equity across California’s various dual enrollment programs. This study provides critical insight from a statewide perspective on whether access and success in dual enrollment programs—including CCAP, Early College High Schools, and Middle College High Schools—is equitable, and how pockets of success may be identified and replicated. We also identify barriers to expanding or scaling dual enrollment programs across the state and developing policy solutions to remove those barriers.\n\nWe use a mixed-method approach, drawing data from various sources—including longitudinal student data from the Chancellor’s Office Management Information Systems (MIS), K–12 school data from the California Department of Education, dual enrollment partnership agreements and annual reports, and in-depth interviews with a select number of K–12 districts, community colleges, and stakeholders. Our MIS sample includes nearly 438,417 dual enrollment students who graduated from high school between 2015–16 and 2019–20 school years. Those students took at least one dual enrollment course at some point between 2012–13 and 2019–20. Our K–12 data includes nearly 3,000 high schools from 2016–17 to 2018–19 school years.\n\nOther interviewees indicated that they would like to see relevant teaching experience and training used as an “equivalent” to certify more high school instructors. One college that offered ESL courses at the high school used experience teaching high school ESL as an equivalent qualification. In other academic disciplines, experience teaching honors/AP subjects such as math, English, and others could potentially be equivalent qualifiers. Revising the requirements could expand dual enrollment programs across the state—this has important policy implications that we address below.\n\nRecruiting students from historically underrepresented populations. Traditional dual enrollment programs in California and across the country have long focused on providing high-achieving students with advanced coursework. These students often learn about dual enrollment opportunities through their parents, peers, or high school counselors. Not surprisingly, students from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education—including Latino, African American, Indigenous, and low-income populations—have also been underrepresented in dual enrollment programs.\n\nIn our stakeholder interviews, we learned that colleges that are especially successful in recruiting equitable shares of historically underrepresented students start by identifying feeder schools that serve large shares of the populations they want to reach. Having college outreach staff attend informational nights at these schools—both in person and virtually during the pandemic—to provide both students and parents with information in multiple languages about dual enrollment opportunities, especially messaging about the college cost savings, was viewed as key in these efforts. Featuring professors and students of color in the recruitment activities was thought to be especially important because this provided students and parents an opportunity to see themselves reflected in college and the program.\n\nImportantly, at two colleges, these intentional recruitment efforts were informed by an examination and discussion of equity data on enrollments and performance, with the goal of sharing information with K–12 partners and engaging in discussions about addressing inequities in access and outcomes. Several colleges also indicated that offering courses such as ethnic studies, African American history, Latin American History, and English as a Second Language also helped them attract historically underrepresented students. Both the recent adoption of a CCC ethnic studies graduation requirement and legislation known as Assembly Bill 1460 (AB 1460), which mandates an ethnic studies graduation requirement at CSU starting in 2021–22, could further expand ethnic studies courses. Offering ethnic studies dual enrollment courses is especially promising, as there is emerging research suggesting that ethnic studies in high school helps improve high school and early college outcomes (Dee and Penner 2017; Bonilla, Dee, and Penner 2021).\n\nComplex application and enrollment process. Several colleges noted that simplifying the complex application and enrollment process could help equitably expand programs. College staff noted that the college application is not “user friendly from a high school perspective”; it often requires hands-on support from counselors and other support staff. They said that a simpler version of the traditional college application could be developed for high school students—and since much of the data gathered through the application are already held by the high school, data-sharing across the two systems could simplify the process even more. The state recently made progress on simplifying enrollment with the passage of AB 30, which allows CCAP students to submit only one parental consent form and principal recommendation. However, a recent report found that some programs still require students to resubmit documents every term (CCCCO 2021); this indicates that more can be done to reduce the barriers posed by the enrollment process.\n\nMinimum high school GPA requirements and prerequisites. Some dual enrollment programs or courses have minimum GPA requirements that may limit opportunities for students who have had fewer academic opportunities. These include programs that have typically enrolled higher-achieving students, including those who were already on the AP/honors track. We learned that real and perceived requirements for ECHS and MCHS may, in some cases, be making the schools less accessible (e.g., eligibility requirements for geometry, or simply a pervasive perception that these schools were only for “smart kids”). In other instances, college placement processes for math and English courses included a minimum GPA and prior coursework requirement.\n\nWhile minimum requirements are intended to ensure that students enroll in courses that match their skills and abilities, the selection criteria may be limiting dual enrollment opportunities for students who could successfully complete courses. This is especially true of dual enrollment programs that still recommend placement into remediation, even under AB 705. For example, recent evidence suggests that the elimination of remedial English that was mandated by AB 705 led to dramatic increases in direct access to and successful completion of gateway English courses within one term (Cuellar Mejia et al. 2020). Traditional placement policies would have placed the majority of students in remedial courses, delaying access to gateway English. More broadly, we learned that an equity work group at one ECHS eliminated minimum course, grade, and test score admissions requirements and adopted a multiple measures admissions strategy that allows students to demonstrate they are ready for 9th grade in a combination of ways. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this ECHS moved to an admissions lottery, which is likely to continue post-pandemic.\n\nFunding for dual enrollment programs. There is some variation in funding across programs. As part of CCAP, MCHS, and ECHS programs, K–12 schools receive full average daily attendance (ADA) funding for dual enrollment students who enroll in a minimum of 180 minutes (3 hours); this minimum is 240 minutes (4 hours) for other forms of dual enrollment. Community colleges can claim apportionment funding at a rate of $5,622 (as of 2020-21) per full-time equivalent (FTE) student if dual enrollment courses are also open to the general college population for MCHS and ECHS programs (Legislative Analyst’s Office 2021). Through CCAP agreements, colleges can claim this apportionment even if the course is open only to high school students. Our interviews with college stakeholders often cited the FTEs as one of the benefits of offering dual enrollment opportunities. A recent LAO (2021) report concluded that CCAP funding policies are favorable to both colleges and high schools.\n\nStill, our interviews suggested there may be opportunities to improve cost-sharing. A Chancellor’s Office memo noted that K–12 and college districts may “voluntarily agree to share” ADA and/or FTE funding (Nguyen 2016), but it was not clear this was happening. Given that K–12 districts often pay for instructors, textbooks, and facilities—particularly for courses taught by high school teachers during the school day—it was not surprising that K–12 stakeholders would like to be able to access some of the college apportionment to help cover these costs.\n\nIn our interviews, both K–12 and college partners indicated that they would like to receive dedicated funding for student supports, including tutoring and counselors. In most programs, students have access to standard tutoring and support services at the high school and college, but most stakeholders felt it was important to have services dedicated to dual enrollment students. We learned that several of the programs that have grown significantly over the last few years were able to hire full-time coordinators and counselors to support the college’s dual enrollment efforts with funding from the general college fund or grant funding such as California Career Pathways Trust (CCPT) or the Strong Workforce Program. College staff noted that large shares of dual enrollment students created the incentive to hire dedicated support staff to promote a successful college experience.\n\nPromoting Equitable Outcomes\n\nIntentional connection of high school career education pathways to college certificate and degree programs. Throughout our interviews, it was clear that colleges and high schools do not want what many referred to as “random acts of dual enrollment.” A Guided Pathways regional coordinator in the Central Valley voiced a strong belief that dual enrollment has to be intentional and tied to a pathway—students are more motivated when they know why they are taking the courses and what they will get out of them. Colleges are interested in doing more to align dual enrollment courses to pathways that lead students into postsecondary programs/degrees after they graduate from high school. Governor Newsom’s dual admissions proposal, which would grant student’s admissions to a CSU or UC at the time they enter the community college, could also help students who begin their postsecondary education at a CCC achieve their academic goals.\n\nIn the Central Valley, some of these pathways are being developed through collaborations between K–12, college, and regional employers. The Wonderful Company Ag Career Prep academy is a good example: it consists of a partnership of the Wonderful Company, three colleges (Bakersfield, West Hills and Reedley), and seven high schools in Kings, Kern, and Fresno Counties. High school students can get paid internships, an associate of science degree, and guaranteed admission to CSU Bakersfield or Fresno State, among other benefits (Wonderful Education n.d.). Other programs are providing opportunities to complete the first few courses toward a certificate or degree that students can earn when in college. For example, the Child Development program at City College of San Francisco pairs courses toward a certificate/degree with paid internships. This allows high school students to make progress toward a college credential while gaining relevant work experience.\n\nA number of college stakeholders viewed dual enrollment as an important part of Guided Pathways because it allows students to explore college degree programs while in high school. Pathways from high school to college are also seen as important for equity initiatives. They give students who may not have seen themselves going to college an opportunity to experience college-level courses while still in a familiar and supportive high school environment.\n\nOverall, however, it was clear that the alignment between dual enrollment and college programs needs to be improved—even within institutions that have made significant progress in some programs. Many stakeholders felt that there will be more conversations about aligning Guided Pathways efforts to dual enrollment in the next few years. Given that some CE credentials do not confer sizeable labor market returns, it will be imperative to align dual enrollment pathways to programs that lead to jobs with living wages. (Bohn et al. 2019; Dadgar and Trimble 2015; Stevens et al. 2019). In the case of child development, the pathway a student begins in dual enrollment could potentially set them on a track to complete a teaching credential or the like.\n\nIntentional alignment of academic pathways to IGETC requirements. Traditional dual enrollment programs, including ECHS and MCHS, have been offering courses intended to fulfill the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) transfer requirements; these courses are intended to prepare students for the transition to college. Importantly, these courses are also aligned with A–G requirements. Several K–12 partners we spoke to, in fact, noted that Advanced Placement (AP) also offers college-level coursework, but dual enrollment is considered more equitable because it does not require the passage of a standardized test (see text box).\n\nWe learned that several CCAP programs are also using these courses to expand IGETC offerings to students who have been underserved by traditional programs. One college in the Central Valley has been working with high schools that do not have well-established career pathways to help students complete the “Golden 4” (gateway math and English, critical thinking, oral communications) before they graduate from high school. At another Central Valley college, the Guided Pathways workgroup recently began work on an IGETC pathway for students interested in attending CSU and UC.\n\nSuccessfully completing courses that meet IGETC requirements gives high school students a significant boost toward earning a college degree. The gateway math course is especially important, as research has shown that math is one of the greatest challenges students face on their journey toward college completion (Johnson and Cuellar Mejia 2020b). Still, our finding that ECHS and MCHS are more likely to offer courses that transfer to CSU/UC (Figure 6) suggests more could be done to strengthen and expand IGETC pathways through CCAP and other dual enrollment programs—indeed, many of the CCAP stakeholders we spoke to appeared to be prioritizing career pathways over IGETC pathways.\n\nColleges and K–12 partners experienced the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of ways. While it was a shock like no other, where educators faced significant challenges during their sudden transition to online courses and supports, the pandemic also created some important opportunities.\n\nCommunity colleges across the state have experienced sizable enrollment declines during the pandemic, while the dual enrollment partners we interviewed pointed to a mix of trends. Retention was a challenge for many colleges, but about half of the colleges we interviewed experienced growth in demand for dual enrollment. College and high school officials believe this growth was spurred by the fact that students could not engage in face-to-face activities that would have conflicted with dual enrollment course taking—sports, work, and other after school activities.\n\nHowever, at a similar number of colleges, dual enrollment either declined, plateaued, or grew only slightly. In addition to economic, physical, and mental health challenges, many students also had trouble accessing the necessary materials and technology for online courses. Furthermore, career-focused courses that entailed hands-on or lab experience were difficult to offer online; some colleges decided to cut back on these kinds of courses. Difficulty getting timely access to the appropriate technology also affected enrollment. One dual enrollment program ran into difficulties because even though students had access to Chromebooks, the school district blocked access to Zoom, the online platform on which the courses were conducted.\n\nInterestingly, the pandemic has spurred conversations about the type of dual enrollment courses that will be needed in the future. For example, some stakeholders felt that pandemic disruptions had increased the need for dual enrollment remediation courses. K–12 teachers were feeling that because they could not fully cover content and standards during the pandemic, their students would need remedial courses.\n\nA recent national survey of the pandemic’s impact on K–12 schools substantiates this feeling: more than half of instructors reported covering half or less of the material that would have been covered had the pandemic not occurred (Hamilton et al. 2020). The perception that students would require more remediation as a result of the pandemic also surfaced in recent research on the implementation of AB 705 in California community colleges. This research found that counselors at one large urban campus asked for more remedial course offerings because the pandemic had disrupted students’ senior year (Cuellar Mejia et al. 2020). Several stakeholders we spoke to expressed appreciation for the opportunity to offer remedial courses through CCAP.\n\nThe pandemic also instigated or accelerated changes that had been requested by high school and college partners for a while. For example, online instruction had long been under discussion, but before the pandemic “not everyone was ready for that.” Moving forward, dual enrollment stakeholders would like to keep offering online courses—in part so that students who previously could not participate because of prior commitments, like work or extracurricular activities, can now participate more easily.\n\nAnother big change implemented during the pandemic is the use of digital forms and documents. The move to electronic documents and signatures has helped expedite the enrollment process, but not without some challenges: students and families with limited technological access and skills may need help with new processes, such signing a PDF. Still, all agreed that they want to continue to use electronic documents and modernizing the enrollment process.\n\nThe potential of dual enrollment to promote more equitable outcomes is alive and well, thanks in large part to the passage of AB 288 and the growth of CCAP partnerships across the state. Our research finds important challenges and opportunities when it comes to expanding dual enrollment opportunities with equity in mind. To inform efforts to promote equitable growth, we offer a series of recommendations based on our findings.\n\nAddress instructor capacity issues. The difficulty of recruiting qualified instructors is a key barrier to expanding dual enrollment. Our interviewees noted that some of these challenges could be addressed if more high school instructors were qualified to teach college courses. However, many high school instructors do not have master’s degrees in the disciplines they teach. One strategy is to help high school teachers acquire master’s degrees in disciplines such as math and English—this strategy is being implemented by the K-16 Collaborative in the Fresno region.\n\nThe community colleges also should investigate the effectiveness of minimum qualifications on instructor quality. A large body of literature suggests that a master’s degree is at best loosely correlated with teacher quality at the K–12 level (Aaronson et al 2007); a similar study needs to be done at the community college level. The colleges should explore revising the minimum qualifications criteria to include experience teaching in the discipline—especially in AP/honors courses—in lieu of a master’s degree. Nearly half of K–12 teachers have at least 15 years of teaching experience, and existing research on teacher effectiveness shows that experience matters.\n\nProvide guidance to align course offerings with college completion—and with pathways toward jobs with living wages. Dual enrollment stakeholders we spoke to were making progress on this front, but it was clear that more could done, as these efforts typically focused on a subset of programs (e.g., child development, agriculture). College partners voiced an interest in getting more support and guidance in this area. Many felt that Guided Pathways could help move this effort forward, and expected to gain traction over the next couple of years. CCC Chancellor’s Office guidance could provide insight on which high-leverage general education and CE course offerings can help students achieve their college goals. Dual enrollment partnerships also need to ensure that college pathways, especially those leading to CE certificates and degrees, lead to careers or jobs with living wages. Given the state’s future workforce needs and the lower representation of Latino, Black, and low-income students among baccalaureate degree earners, efforts to promote the completion of IGETC’s “Golden 4,” gateway math and English courses, in particular—could help the state improve equity. More could also be done to inform students about the benefits of dual enrollment as compared to AP coursework. Finally, given our finding that CCAP students—especially Latinos—are more likely to enroll in a CCC than a four-year college after they graduate from high school, the state could benefit from a dual admissions policy like the one proposed by Governor Newsom and the Governor’s Recovery with Equity Taskforce, which would grant students admission to a CSU or UC school upon entering a CCC.\n\nBuild on recent equity-centered legislation to improve equitable access and outcomes. The passage of AB 288 (CCAP), AB 705 (equitable math and English placement), and AB 1460 (CSU ethnic studies graduation requirement), represents a great opportunity to advance the goal of helping underrepresented students make progress toward a college degree. Colleges and their K–12 partners have an opportunity to help all high school students complete math, English, and ethnic studies general education requirements. This is supported by the research finding positive impacts of taking ethnic studies courses on high school and early college outcomes (Bonilla et al. 2021; Dee and Penner 2017) and the evidence on the positive effects of completing gateway math and English courses on early college outcomes and transfer (Cuellar Mejia et al. 2020; Johnson and Cuellar Mejia 2020b). The ability to use the senior year of high school to complete key CCC, CSU, and UC admissions and/or graduation requirements would constitute a more efficient use of resources and align the three systems. Furthermore, if more high school students were able to complete gateway math during their senior year, CSU’s concern about the necessity of a fourth year of quantitative reasoning could be alleviated (CSU 2020b).\n\nConsider restricting dual enrollment courses in remedial math and English. AB 288 stipulates that CCAP course offerings can “deliver innovative remediation courses for the purpose of ensuring the student is prepared for college-level work upon graduation.” But high schools are supposed to be preparing students to meet graduation and college readiness standards. Now that AB 705 is shifting community colleges away from remedial courses, we recommend that CCAP policy be amended to restrict remedial math and English courses. Instead, resources should be used to strengthen the high school curriculum so that high school students are prepared to take gateway math and English courses during their senior year or upon entry to college. Our interviews suggested that many colleges see CCAP as a way to keep and expand remedial course offerings, something that clearly does not meet the goals of dual enrollment or the AB 705 reforms. AB 288 should be revised to align with the goals of AB 705 and the subsequent system wide shift away from remedial math and English.\n\nFacilitate alignment with the CCCCO’s Vision for Success and Guided Pathways. Our dual enrollment recommendations are linked to the goals of the Chancellor’s Office’s Vision for Success and efforts to implement the Guided Pathways initiative. After all, if community colleges are not structured in a way to help students navigate successfully toward degrees and transfers, the potential of dual enrollment will not be fully realized. It is also important that colleges get credit for offering key gateway math and English as dual enrollment courses in student success metrics and in the funding formula. Otherwise, colleges have fewer incentives to offer these courses to high school students.\n\nEstablish a longitudinal student database that streamlines the application and enrollment process and allows educators and policymakers to track dual enrollment participation and outcomes in high school, postsecondary education, and the labor market. Given the complexity of the application process and technological barriers faced by underserved communities, there could be important equity gains if high schools and CCCs were able to share data and automate the application process. Longitudinal data is especially critical for dual enrollment because it involves both the K–12 and CCC sectors—and students may subsequently attend any college, not necessarily the college that offered dual enrollment coursework in their K–12 district. And some students may decide to enter the labor market directly after high school. Such a data system would allow researchers to inform efforts to help ensure equitable access, better track student’s outcomes throughout this journey, design intervention programs to support student learning, and identify pathways that serve historically under-represented students more effectively. Importantly, the governor and the legislature are supporting efforts to establish a data system that connects K–12, higher education, workforce, and social services data (Jackson 2021).\n\nDual enrollment programs are an important policy lever to improve the transition from high school to college, expand educational opportunities, and improve economic mobility. As the state recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the K–12 and community college systems work together to build an equitable and effective system that addresses the academic and socio-emotional needs of students."
