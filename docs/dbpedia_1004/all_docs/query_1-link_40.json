        "text": "See the Assessment section of the Late Language Emergence Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nBecause children with late language emergence (LLE) remain at risk for later language and literacy problems, early assessment and periodic monitoring are essential to track language development and identify any problems that might arise. For children who present with signs and symptoms of LLE, the typical diagnostic pathway includes a broad check of speech and language development, along with periodic monitoring via screening and systematic observation. If delays persist over time or if additional developmental problems arise, a complete assessment may be warranted.\n\nIdeally, screening and assessment take place in the child’s home or in a childcare setting. Many individuals are not represented by assessment norming samples (e.g., dual language learners), and the resulting scores may not be valid (Banerjee & Guiberson, 2012; Guiberson & Banerjee, 2012). Thus, multiple sources of information are necessary to assess for LLE. The speech-language pathologist (SLP) can also gather information about the child’s language skills through parent and caregiver report and interviews, developmental observations, and language sampling. See ASHA’s resource on assessment tools, techniques, and data sources.\n\nScreening and assessment results are interpreted within the context of a child’s overall development and in collaboration with family members and other professionals as appropriate. Contextualized interpretation is important because communication is only one aspect of children’s interactions with the environment.\n\nScreening\n\nCareful screening by an SLP helps to identify young children at risk for language disorders and to determine the need for further speech and language assessment or referral for other professional services. Screening is also an important component of prevention, family education, and support for young children and their families.\n\nScreening measures may involve direct interaction with the child and/or parent report on a standardized instrument. In fact, the validity of the screening process may increase when professional-administered measures are combined with parent-completed measures (Glascoe, 1999). For screening purposes, however, either standardized testing or parent report is adequate, provided that the measure used has adequate psychometric properties.\n\nScreening typically includes\n\ngathering information from parents, caregivers, and/or preschool teachers regarding concerns about the child's language skills;\n\nconducting a hearing screening to rule out hearing loss as a possible contributing factor to language difficulties or, for a child who is reluctant or unable to complete a hearing screening, observing their response to sound and noise in the environment and referring the child for audiologic assessment if there is a concern;\n\nusing a formal screening tool, observations, and parent questionnaires and checklists to obtain information about the child's communication behaviors;\n\nusing other language assessment methods (e.g., observing the child in play activities with familiar individuals); and\n\ngathering information about speech sound development (e.g., via an informal language sample obtained during play activities).\n\nScreening may result in recommendations for\n\na complete audiologic assessment;\n\nplans to monitor speech and language development, with rescreening as appropriate;\n\nsuggestions for encouraging language development using language stimulation activities;\n\na comprehensive speech and language assessment that includes evaluation of social communication skills, symbolic play, and use of gestures; and/or\n\na referral for medical or other professional services.\n\nIf periodic monitoring indicates persistent delays, a comprehensive speech and language assessment may be indicated.\n\nConsistent with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework (ASHA, 2023; WHO, 2001), a comprehensive assessment is conducted to identify and describe\n\nimpairments in body structure and function, including underlying strengths and weaknesses in verbal and nonverbal communication;\n\ncomorbid deficits or conditions, such as developmental disability, medical conditions, or syndromes;\n\nlimitations in activity and participation, including functional communication, interpersonal interactions with family and peers, and learning;\n\ncontextual (environmental and personal) factors that serve as barriers to or facilitators of successful communication and life participation; and\n\nthe impact of communication impairments on quality of life of the child and family.\n\nSee ASHA’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) for examples of assessment data consistent with the ICF framework for various clinical disorders.\n\nPre-Assessment Planning\n\nProfessionals from a variety of disciplines have encouraged the use of pre-assessment planning for young children (Boone & Crais, 1999; Crais et al., 2006). Pre-assessment planning involves one or more professionals who meet with the child and family to gather information and plan the upcoming assessment. Common goals for planning include identifying what the family needs and wants from the assessment process, the roles that family members (and caregivers) would prefer to take in the assessment, and the child’s areas of strength and need (Boone & Crais, 1999). See ASHA’s resources on person- and family-centered care and collaboration and teaming.\n\nSpeech and Language Assessment\n\nThe comprehensive speech and language assessment considers the most common concerns for children with LLE, including\n\nfailure to begin using words,\n\nthe absence of a “vocabulary spurt,” and\n\nfailure to begin combining words in the second year of life.\n\nFor children with LLE who have not yet acquired verbal language, the assessment focuses on preverbal behaviors, including play, gesture, and other forms of nonverbal communication and interaction.\n\nFor children who exhibit various forms of communication (e.g., gestures, vocalizations, words), the assessment evaluates their ability to successfully use these forms for functional communication.\n\nChildren learn language in the context of interacting with those close to them. Therefore, it is important to gather information about the child’s interactions with family members and caregivers as well as to be aware that communication styles are influenced by social and cultural factors (see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness).\n\nTypical Components of the Speech and Language Assessment\n\nCase History\n\nfamily’s concerns about the child’s speech and language\n\nchild’s birth and developmental history\n\nchild’s medical history, including history of middle ear infections\n\nfamily history of LLE or other language difficulties\n\nfor children who are dual language learners\n\nlanguage(s) used in the home and community and the circumstances in which each language is used\n\nchild’s age when first exposed to English or the other language(s) and the amount of exposure to all of the languages in the child’s environments\n\ntype of language experience in the child’s environment (e.g., home literacy activities, conversations, television)\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology.\n\nHearing Screening\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Childhood Hearing Screening.\n\nSpoken Language Assessment (Expressive and Receptive)\n\nmeans of communication (e.g., vocalizations, words, gestures, eye gaze)\n\nfunctions of communication (e.g., requesting and protesting, greeting, commenting)\n\nexpressive vocabulary (emerging words and word approximations in all languages spoken)\n\nrate of vocabulary growth\n\nvocabulary diversity (e.g., nouns, pronouns, relational words)\n\nword combinations and length of utterance\n\nmeaning expressed in early word combinations\n\nearly grammar, including phrase/sentence structure and word forms\n\nreceptive vocabulary\n\ncomprehension of simple commands\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Spoken Language Disorders.\n\nPlay Behavior and Social Communication Assessment\n\nsymbolic play\n\nsocial pretend play\n\ncomprehension of early social routines\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Social Communication Disorder.\n\nSpeech Sound Assessment and Emergent Literacy Language Assessment\n\noral mechanism examination\n\ninventory of sounds produced\n\nproportion of consonants\n\ninventory of syllable shapes\n\npresence of multisyllabic utterances\n\ninterest in books\n\nphonemic awareness\n\nlooking at or pointing to and labeling pictures in books\n\nholding a crayon or pencil and scribbling on paper\n\nanticipating routines in books\n\nretelling stories\n\nprint concept knowledge and early book-handling skills\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Speech Sound Disorders: Articulation and Phonology and Written Language Disorders.\n\nAssessment is accomplished using a variety of measures and activities, including both standardized and nonstandardized measures, as well as formal and informal assessment tools. SLPs have the obligation to ensure that standardized measures used in assessment show robust psychometric properties that provide strong evidence of their quality (Dollaghan, 2004). Competency-based tools, self-report questionnaires, and norm-referenced report measures (e.g., parent, teacher, and significant other) are frequently used. Analog tasks that mimic real-world situations and naturalistic observations can be used to gather information about an individual’s communication skills in simulated social situations or in everyday social settings.\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on assessment tools, techniques, and data sources for general information about assessment options. Keep in mind that several factors can affect the way children interact with their caregivers, including\n\ncontextual factors (e.g., home or clinic setting),\n\nfamiliarity with the observer and the materials or toys being used, and\n\nthe type of interaction (e.g., free-play, book reading, or completing a particular task).\n\nFor bilingual children, assessment in all languages is necessary to differentiate between a linguistic difference and a true communication disorder (see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology). The use of standardized tests alone is not sufficient and may not be appropriate. Test scores are invalid for individuals who are not represented in the normative group for the test’s standardization sample, even if the test is administered as instructed. In these cases, the tests cannot be used to determine the presence or absence of a communication disorder. Non-normed (criterion) measures, along with observation, language sampling, ethnographic interviewing, and dynamic assessment procedures, are fundamental to differentiating a difference from a disorder (see ASHA’s resource titled Dynamic Assessment and ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness).\n\nAssessment may result in\n\ndetermination of a language delay,\n\ndiagnosis of a spoken language disorder,\n\nidentification of delayed early literacy skills,\n\nidentification of delayed phonological development,\n\nidentification of social communication problems,\n\nidentification of possible hearing problems,\n\nrecommendation for ongoing monitoring of language development and caregiver training in language facilitation,\n\nrecommendation for direct intervention and support,\n\nreferral to early intervention services for eligibility determination (see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Early Intervention), and\n\nreferral to other professionals as needed (e.g., for assessment of sensory, motor, and cognitive skills).\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n\nWhen interpreting data from the comprehensive assessment, it is important to be aware of variability in early vocabulary growth and early word combinations in young children. As single indicators of later language outcomes, individual differences in the acquisition of these skills before the age of 4 years are not highly predictive of later language outcomes. In addition, children with receptive language delay have poorer prognoses than children with predominantly expressive delay (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).\n\nWith these factors in mind, the SLP will need to differentiate normal variations in language development from language delay or language disorder and from comorbid conditions associated with language delay or disorder (see ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Communication Disorder, and Intellectual Disability).\n\nSharing Assessment Results\n\nApproaches for sharing assessment information depend on the purpose of the assessment (e.g., determining eligibility for services or monitoring language skills), the assessment approach and the tools used, and the preferences of the family.\n\nThe following are common principles that promote a collaborative exchange of information:\n\nInclude all those who can contribute to and gain from the integration and sharing of the assessment information (Boone & Crais, 1999); this includes family members and others who are likely to be members of the child’s team, as well as those who can provide support to the child and family.\n\nInclude opportunities for all members to discuss their thoughts and feelings.\n\nDescribe the child’s strengths or areas for growth and identify routines where the child can be supported in these areas.\n\nSet the tone for future interactions with service providers.\n\nSee also ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Counseling For Professional Service Delivery.\n\nConsiderations for Assessing Younger Children\n\nAlthough the scope of this page is children from 2 to 4 years of age, younger children may be referred to an SLP with concerns about language development. Depending on the presenting symptoms, the SLP may conduct a comprehensive speech and language assessment to determine the need for early intervention. The SLP might also refer the child to other professionals, if the symptoms suggest disorders or conditions other than—or in addition to—language delay. See ASHA’s Practice Portal Page on Early Intervention and information about the Child Find mandate.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Considerations\n\nKey cultural and linguistic considerations include\n\nreviewing cultural and linguistic variables and factors that may influence communication (e.g., child-rearing practices, perceptions of disability, rules of social interaction, context of communication), in order to determine whether the communication patterns of an individual may be related to their cultural background (see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness);\n\ndetermining whether the communication pattern is related to the individual’s linguistic background (see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology);\n\nunderstanding that differences may be related to limited exposure to and development of new cultural communication patterns;\n\nrecognizing that assimilation and level of acculturation may influence individual communication patterns and behaviors;\n\nidentifying a disorder as a breakdown in communication that is sufficient to negatively influence the effective use of symbols and message processing in all languages used by the speaker;\n\nrecognizing that a dialectal variation of a communication system is rule based and should not be considered a disorder of speech or language;\n\nunderstanding that vocabulary and concept development are distributed across languages and may be connected to different speakers and contexts; and\n\nidentifying the family’s developmental priorities and building onto the family’s existent routines and interactions to support the child in acquiring language skills (Guiberson & Ferris, 2018, 2019).\n\nThe ability to learn and use language does not appear to be negatively affected by learning more than one language (Pearson, 2013). When combined vocabularies are measured, researchers have found that bilingual children acquire vocabulary at the same rate as their monolingual peers (Hoff et al., 2012; Junker & Stockman, 2002; Pearson, 1998). Pearson (1998) found that using strategies such as conceptual scoring (i.e., scoring the meaning of a word, regardless of the language in which it is produced) when assessing linguistic skills across languages is an effective way to demonstrate that the skills of typically developing bilingual children are on a par with those of monolingual children. These findings support the belief that LLE is not a result of introducing a second language or simultaneously acquiring two languages. Monolingualism is not necessary and should not be advised as a response to LLE. A strong model in any language helps build a linguistic foundation that will aid in the acquisition of other languages.\n\nIf a child demonstrates difficulties in the acquisition of his or her native language and a second language, an evaluation may be warranted. Understanding the normal processes and phenomena of second-language acquisition and simultaneous bilingualism is important to ensure accurate assessment of bilingual clients.\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Late Language Emergence Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nLanguage intervention for toddlers and preschoolers with late language emergence can vary along a continuum from indirect to direct services. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are involved in direct treatment and are often involved in monitoring and indirect intervention. SLPs can help remediate problems and potentially prevent future difficulties and the need for subsequent school-based services.\n\nThe goal of language intervention is to stimulate overall language development and to teach language skills in an integrated fashion and in context. This approach promotes effective everyday communication and enhances the family’s ability to support the child’s development.\n\nThe level of service (i.e., indirect or direct) is individualized for each child and family. When making these decisions, it is critical to identify the nature and severity of the language delay, its overall effect on communication, the presence of risk factors, and the child’s global developmental skills.\n\nWhen no other developmental delays or disabilities have been identified or are suspected, the typical course for late language emergence is regular monitoring or monitoring combined with indirect language stimulation.\n\nWhen language delays persist over time or are present with other identified or suspected delays or disabilities (e.g., intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, hearing impairment), direct speech and language services are indicated; the SLP engages in interprofessional practice and coordinates services with other professionals working with the child. See ASHA’s resources on collaboration and teaming and interprofessional education/interprofessional practice (IPE/IPP).\n\nEach child has a unique language profile that may be influenced by their cultural background, the language(s) spoken in the home, and the family constellation. It is important to consider these factors when developing an intervention plan. For more information on culturally and linguistically appropriate service delivery, see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology.\n\nWorking With Families\n\nA key component to successful intervention with toddlers is working closely with families. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; 2004) requires that families have the opportunity to share any concerns and priorities that might guide or influence treatment.\n\nThere are a number of key activities that can guide the gathering of this type of information (Bailey, 2004; Winton, 1996).\n\nThese activities include the following:\n\nidentifying the family’s concerns and what they hope to accomplish with intervention;\n\ndetermining how the family perceives the child’s strengths and needs relative to family values and within the family structure and routines;\n\nidentifying the priorities of the family and how service providers may help with these priorities;\n\nidentifying the family’s existing resources relative to priorities;\n\nidentifying the family’s preferred roles in the service delivery decision-making process; and\n\nestablishing a supportive, informed, and collaborative relationship with the family.\n\nA family-centered approach aligns with the federal mandate to provide services in natural environments. Collaborating with parents and caregivers about routines and everyday activities helps to\n\nidentify learning opportunities that occur in the home, community, or school;\n\ndetermine the communication goals for the child;\n\nlearn about the child’s preferences and interests; and\n\nidentify and implement techniques for intervention.\n\nSee ASHA’s resources on family-centered practice and person- and family-centered care.\n\nIndirect Intervention\n\nIndirect intervention consists of activities to stimulate language development. Typically, the SLP provides ideas and sample activities for parents and caregivers to engage in with the child. The SLP encourages enrichment activities (e.g., book sharing and play groups) and multimodal communication (e.g., speech, gestures, signs, and pictures).\n\nThe SLP may continue to monitor the child on a regular basis during this time and consult with parents and caregivers as needed. For some children, the SLP may provide families with more focused language stimulation activities (e.g., language models designed specifically for that child).\n\nInteraction styles that stimulate language competence and enhance communication in young children include\n\nproviding responses directly related to a child’s communication attempt,\n\nproviding spoken language models for the child,\n\nproviding models of nonverbal communication behaviors (e.g., gestures and eye gaze),\n\nimitating or expanding the child’s actions or words,\n\nreinforcing the child’s communication attempts, and\n\ngiving the child adequate time to initiate communication and respond to adults (Girolametto et al., 1999; Kaiser et al., 2001; Wilcox, 1992; Yoder & Warren, 2001).\n\nDirect Intervention\n\nDirect intervention consists of activities designed and implemented by an SLP. Direct intervention may be indicated for children identified as having, or being at risk for, communication impairment. The family and SLP select goals that are developmentally appropriate and that offer the potential for improving communication and promoting academic and social success.\n\nEffective intervention promotes the child’s participation in natural settings and is\n\ncomprehensive, coordinated, and team based;\n\ndevelopmentally supportive;\n\nfamily centered; and\n\nculturally and linguistically responsive.\n\nTreatment Approaches\n\nTreatment approaches for children with language delay or disorder can vary along a continuum of naturalness (Fey, 1986). They include\n\nclinician-directed—drill-based activities in a therapy room,\n\nchild-centered—play-based activities that include everyday activities in natural settings, and\n\nhybrid—activities and settings that combine both approaches.\n\nOne example of a hybrid approach is dialogic reading, an interactive technique in which adults prompt children with questions and engage them in discussions while reading together (Zevenbergen & Whitehurst, 2003).\n\nOther strategies may include involving extended family, siblings, or other children and engaging in structured didactic learning tasks led by the care provider (Guiberson & Ferris, 2018, 2019).\n\nAugmentative and alternative communication methods may be considered as a temporary means of communication for children with late language emergence. Research shows that the use of augmentative and alternative communication may in fact aid in the development of natural speech and language (Lüke, 2014; Romski et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2013). See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Augmentative and Alternative Communication.\n\nThe SLP considers the cultural background of the child and their family when selecting the best treatment approach. For example, in the cultures of some individuals, “It may be even less natural to engage in child-led play-based interactions, as this is sometimes inconsistent with social roles and expectations” (Wing et al., 2007, p. 23). See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness.\n\nIt is not necessary or beneficial to recommend monolingualism for multilingual children who show language delays. Bilingualism has not been shown to inhibit language development or therapeutic outcomes in the presence of language disorders (Bird et al., 2005; Hambly & Fombonne, 2012; Valicenti-McDermott et al., 2013). All languages that an individual uses are important culturally and socially. Discouraging the use of one of those languages may be a disservice to the child’s functional communication and language development in different contexts (Cruz-Ferreira, 2011).\n\nFor more information about language intervention and a description of specific treatment approaches, see the Treatment section of ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Spoken Language Disorders.\n\nEligibility for Services\n\nTo gain access to early intervention services, a child first must qualify for intervention according to state agency guidelines. Some late talkers will qualify for special education services on the basis of an evaluation conducted by their school district (see Child Find). Speech and language services may be indicated for children identified as having, or being at risk for, communication impairment.\n\nIf the child is determined to be eligible for services, an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) is developed in accordance with Part C of IDEA, which covers children from birth to 3 years of age. The IFSP is a written plan for providing early intervention services that\n\nare based on the evaluation and assessment;\n\ninclude a statement of the child’s present levels of physical development (including vision, hearing, and health status), cognitive development, communication development, social or emotional development, and adaptive development;\n\nare implemented as soon as possible after parental consent has been obtained for the early intervention services; and\n\nare reviewed periodically (every 6 months) and annually.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Early Intervention for details. See also ASHA’s resource titled Current IDEA Part C Final Regulations (2011).\n\nTransition to Part B of IDEA\n\nWhen a child reaches the age of 3 years, they transition from preschool to school-based services, in accordance with Part B of IDEA. At this point, an individualized education program is developed. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Early Intervention for details. See also ASHA’s resources titled IDEA Part C Issue Brief: Transitions (Including Part C to Part B/Exiting Part C) and IDEA Part B Issue Brief: Individualized Education Programs and Eligibility for Services.\n\nOne of the goals of IDEA (2004) is to ensure a seamless transition process for families moving from one program to another as well as timely access to appropriate services. It is stipulated that there be a transition plan that includes participation by representatives from each program, as well as family members.\n\nThe SLP can have different roles during this transition period. When the SLP functions as the IFSP service coordinator, they directly oversee transition activities. As such, they need to be knowledgeable about a wide range of resources in the community. When the SLP functions as a member of the IFSP team, they assist the family and other team members by helping make the transition process as smooth and positive as possible.\n\nInterdisciplinary Approach\n\nSLPs and other professionals, in collaboration with families and caregivers, are typically involved in the selection and delivery of services and supports for young children. It is essential that all professionals involved in the process collaborate effectively with other team members and be knowledgeable about typical and atypical patterns of development in the domains of\n\ncognition;\n\ncommunication;\n\nemergent literacy; and\n\nmotor, sensory, and social–emotional functioning.\n\nDepending on the needs of the child, the interdisciplinary team can include\n\nan audiologist,\n\nan early childhood general or special educator,\n\nan interpreter,\n\na neurodevelopmental pediatrician,\n\nan occupational therapist,\n\na physical therapist,\n\na school psychologist, and\n\nan SLP.\n\nOther professionals who may be involved include bilingual specialists, English Language Acquisition teachers, childcare providers, educational diagnosticians, educational therapists, reading specialists, social workers, child and developmental psychologists, pediatric neurologists, and child psychiatrists.\n\nSee ASHA’s resources on collaboration and teaming and interprofessional education/interprofessional practice (IPE/IPP).\n\nService Delivery Options\n\nSee the Service Delivery section of the Late Language Emergence Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nIn addition to determining the optimal speech and language approach for the child with late language emergence, SLPs consider other service delivery variables—including format, provider, dosage, and setting—that might affect treatment outcomes.\n\nFormat\n\nFormat refers to the structure of the treatment session (e.g., one-on-one or group).\n\nIndirect intervention will, by its nature, involve key individuals in the child’s everyday life. This can include one-on-one activities with the child and parent or caregiver or group activities within the family or within a school setting that may include siblings, peers, and teachers.\n\nIf the child is receiving direct intervention, services are typically structured within the context of the child’s home, community, group care settings, or school. The format will include key people in those settings (e.g., parents, teachers, care providers, siblings, and peers).\n\nTelepractice can also be used to deliver face-to-face services remotely. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Telepractice.\n\nProvider\n\nProvider refers to the person providing the treatment (e.g., SLP, trained volunteer, caregiver).\n\nFor children who receive indirect intervention, the SLP typically provides ideas and sample activities for parents and caregivers to engage in with the child. The SLP monitors the child on a regular basis during this time and consults with parents and caregivers as needed.\n\nChildren and families receiving direct intervention might have multiple service providers from different disciplines. This transdisciplinary team includes a primary service provider, who serves as the primary point of contact for the family, and other professionals who support the primary service provider through consultations, team meetings, coaching, or training (Shelden & Rush, 2013).\n\nDosage\n\nDosage refers to the frequency, intensity, and duration of service.\n\nDosage depends a great deal on the needs of the child and their family and caregivers. Regardless of whether the child receives indirect or direct intervention, some families and caregivers will need more frequent contact and more concrete support (Bagnato et al., 2011). Others prefer longer intervals between contacts to allow more time to use strategies, practice new skills, and gain confidence in their abilities (Dunst et al., 2014; Keilty, 2010; Roberts et al., 2016).\n\nSetting\n\nSetting refers to the location of treatment (e.g., home, community-based).\n\nFactors such as geographical location, child and family needs and available resources, and family preferences will help determine where services and supports occur (Dunst et al., 2014; Searcy, 2018).\n\nTo the extent possible, intervention services and supports are provided in natural environments, including the child’s home and community settings. The natural environments for services and supports may change over time as family and child needs change. Some children may receive services in more than one setting.\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics. (2016, November 1.) Where We Stand: Screen Time.
