        "text": "SEATTLE, WASH.Â âÂ Sounders FC today announced that it has signed forward BraudÃ­lio Rodrigues to a contract for the 2024 season, with club options in 2025 and 2026. Rodrigues signed with Tacoma Defiance prior to the 2023 MLS NEXT Pro season and set a Defiance single-season club record with 17 goals. As part of the deal, the Rave Green acquired the College Protected Period Priority for Rodrigues from New York City FC in exchange for a natural third-round selection in the 2025 MLS SuperDraft.\n\nâWe are pleased to have signed BraudÃ­lio to the First Team following a standout season with Tacoma Defiance,â said Sounders FC General Manager and Chief Soccer Officer Craig Waibel. âHe has shown an ability to score goals at every step so far in young career, and we look forward to continuing his development at the next level.â\n\nRodrigues, 24, signed with Tacoma on February 28, 2023, after a prolific collegiate career with Franklin Pierce University. In his first professional season, he set a single-season club record for Defiance / S2 with 15 regular-season goals in 2023, then bagged two more via a brace in a Western Conference Quarterfinals victory over Houston Dynamo 2. Additionally, Rodrigues became only the third player in club history to record a hat trick on August 9 against Sporting Kansas City II. The Portugal native added four assists and was the only Defiance player to appear in all 30 matches for the club (28 starts), including starting the squadâs two postseason matches.\n\nâBraudÃ­lio has earned this opportunity and weâre pleased to welcome him to the First Team,â said Sounders FC Head Coach Brian Schmetzer. âThe entire Defiance staff did a tremendous job with his development last year and I look forward to seeing him work once preseason training begins.â\n\nAt the collegiate level, Rodrigues recorded 31 goals and 25 assists in 45 career matches over two seasons at Franklin Pierce University. He tallied 20 goals (tied for second in Division II) and 22 assists (first in Division II) in 2022, en route to a 25-0-1 season and the National Championship. Following his efforts in 2022, Rodrigues was awarded the Ron Lenz National Player of the Year award, given to the top menâs soccer player in Division II, as well as the United Soccer Coaches National Player of the Year. Rodrigues also was named to the Division II Conference Commissioners Association All-America First Team, All-East Region First Team and All-East Region Player of the Year.\n\nSounders FC finished the 2023 regular season second in the Western Conference with 53 points (14-9-11), advancing to the Western Conference Semifinals before falling 1-0 to LAFC. The club is currently in the middle of preseason preparations for the 2024 season, which kicks off against LAFC on Saturday, February 24 at BMO Field (1:30 p.m. PT / Apple TV, FOX, iHeartMedia Seattle, El Rey 1360 AM).\n\nTRANSACTION:Â Tacoma Defiance signs forward BraudÃ­lio Rodrigues to a one-year contract with club options in 2025 and 2026 on January 12, 2024. Seattle acquired the College Protected Period Priority for Rodrigues from New York City FC for a natural third-round pick in the 2025 MLS SuperDraft. NYCFC retains a sell-on percentage and could receive up to $50,000 in GAM if certain performance-based metrics are achieved.\n\nFull Name:Â BraudÃ­lio Rodrigues\n\nPronunciation:Â Brau-dee-lee-oh Rod-ree-guess\n\nPosition:Â Forward\n\nHeight:Â 6-1\n\nWeight:Â 170\n\nHometown:Â Lisbon, Portugal\n\nDate of Birth:Â November 15, 1999, in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau\n\nNationality:Â Portugal"
