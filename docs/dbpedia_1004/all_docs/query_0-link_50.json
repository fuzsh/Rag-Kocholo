        "text": "Student Survey\n\nStatistics Anxiety. Statistics anxiety was measured by the Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS; ). The three anxiety subscales (; ) of the STARS were used (23 items in total): test and class anxiety (8 items), interpretation anxiety (11 items), and fear of asking for help (4 items). Each item describes a situation involving statistics such as “Doing an examination in a statistics course” (test and class anxiety), “Interpreting the meaning of a table in a journal article” (interpretation anxiety), or “Going to ask my statistics teacher for individual help with material I am having difficulty understanding” (fear of asking for help). Participants were asked to indicate how much anxiety they feel in those situations on a Likert scale ranging from 1 = “no anxiety” to 5 = “a great deal of anxiety”.\n\nSeveral items use outdated language and were modified to reflect modern equivalents (e.g., “Asking one of my teachers for help in understanding a printout” was changed to “Asking one of my teachers for help in understanding statistical output”). These modifications are the same as those made in Terry et al. ().\n\nAn attention check was also included in this scale, which asked participants to “Please select ‘1 – no anxiety’ for this question”.\n\nMathematics Anxiety. Mathematics anxiety was measured with the Revised Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (R-MARS; ). There are three subscales in the R-MARS which measure mathematics test anxiety (15 items), numerical task anxiety (5 original items plus 4 modified items – see the Modified STARS and R-MARS section below for modification details), and mathematics course anxiety (5 items). Each item describes a situation involving mathematics such as “Taking an exam in a math course” (mathematics test anxiety), “Being given a set of division problems to solve” (numerical task anxiety), or “Listening to another student explain a math formula” (mathematics course anxiety). Participants were asked to indicate how much anxiety they feel in those situations on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = “no anxiety” to 5 = “a great deal of anxiety”.\n\nWhere the local context required it, items were modified to reflect local equivalents of US terms (e.g., in the UK, “Taking the math section of a college entrance exam” was changed to “Taking the maths section of a university entrance exam”).\n\nModified STARS and R-MARS. The modified versions of the STARS (STARS-M) and R-MARS (R-MARS-S) used in Terry et al. () were also included. In these versions, the original STARS items were revised to reflect mathematics-related situations (e.g., “Doing the coursework for a statistics course” was changed to “Doing the coursework for a mathematics course”) and the original R-MARS statements were revised to reflect statistics-related situations (e.g., “Walking into a mathematics class” was changed to “Walking into a statistics class”). The response scales were kept the same as the originals.\n\nThree items in the original STARS were not easily distinguishable as being about either mathematics or statistics so equivalent items were not created (“Arranging to have a body of data put into the computer”, “Reading an advertisement for a car which includes figures on miles per gallon, depreciation, etc.”, and “Trying to understand the odds in a lottery”). Additionally, one item on the original R-MARS was deemed untranslatable to a statistics context so, again, an equivalent was not created (“Reading a cash register receipt after your purchase”). These items are, therefore, identical to the original scales. When creating composites of the STARS-M and the R-MARS-S, the original items should be included instead so that both modified scales have the same number of items as their originals (23 for the STARS-M and 20 for the R-MARS-S).\n\nThe exploratory factor analysis in Terry et al. () indicated that the R-MARS numerical task anxiety subscale was the only subscale where the revised items did not load onto the same factor as the corresponding original items. We believe the inconsistency in factor loadings in the original study could be because the modifications were not equivalent. For example, “Being given a set of numerical problems involving addition to solve on paper” was modified for the statistical context to “Calculating the sum of squared deviances by adding the squared deviances together” and, although the two both involved addition, the latter would be less familiar to participants and, thus, could be perceived as more a complex mathematical task. To rule out the possibility that the original and modified items loaded onto separate factors due to differences in perceived complexity, we re-modified the numerical task anxiety items and added these to the present version (as well as the original modifications, for comparison). Four items (R-MARS-S-NUM) were modified from mathematics items to statistics items whilst keeping the language more consistent (e.g., “Being given a set of numerical problems involving addition to solve on paper” was modified to “Being given a set of statistical problems involving addition to solve on paper”) and four items (R-MARS-NUM) were changed from our original modifications back to mathematics but matching the more complex language used (e.g., “Calculating the sum of squared deviances by adding the squared deviances together” has been modified to “Finding the codomain of the function h(x, y) = x + y when x = {3,4,5,6} and y = {5,7,9,13}”).\n\nAn attention check was also included in the STARS-M, which asked participants to “Please select ‘5 – a great deal of anxiety’ for this question”.\n\nTrait Anxiety. Trait anxiety was measured using the trait subscale of the State Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA; ). The STICSA has been developed and evidenced to differentiate anxiety from depression more effectively than other popular anxiety measures (e.g., the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); ; ). The trait subscale is further broken down into cognitive (10 items) and somatic symptoms (11 items). Cognitive symptoms are measured with statements such as “I cannot concentrate without irrelevant thoughts intruding” and somatic symptoms are measured with statements such as “My heart beats fast”. Participants are asked to indicate the extent to which each item is true of them on a Likert scale ranging from 1 = “not at all” to 4 = “very much so”.\n\nAn attention check was also included in this scale, which asked participants to “Please select ‘1 – not at all’ for this question”.\n\nTest Anxiety. Test anxiety was measured with the Revised Test Anxiety Scale (R TAS; (). The scale contains four subscales: 7 worry items (e.g., “During tests I find myself thinking about the consequences of failing”), 6 tension items (e.g., “During tests I feel very tense”), 5 test-irrelevant thinking items (e.g., “During tests I find I am distracted by thoughts of upcoming events”), and 7 bodily symptoms items (e.g., “I get a headache during an important test”). We included 5 items later removed by Benson and El-Zahhar () to form a 20-item scale, which secondary researchers may also wish to remove (see , for details). Participants were asked to respond to each item in terms of how they feel when taking tests in general on a scale of 1 = “almost never” to 4 = “almost always”.\n\nFear of Negative Evaluation. Following recommendations by Carleton et al. (), fear of negative evaluation was measured using the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale – Straightforward (BNFE-S; ; ). The scale contains 8 items, including statements such as, “I am afraid that people will find fault with me” and “I often worry that I will say or do the wrong things”. The BNFE-S omits the reverse-scored items in the original BNFE scale (items 2, 4, 7, and 10), which were found to be measuring a different construct (). Participants were asked to indicate how characteristic each item is of them on a Likert scale ranging from 1 = “not at all characteristic of me” to 5 = “extremely characteristic of me”.\n\nAn attention check was also included in this scale, which asked participants to “Please select ‘3 – moderately characteristic of me’ for this question”.\n\nSocial Interaction Anxiety and Performance Anxiety. Social interaction anxiety and performance anxiety were measured using the experienced fear/anxiety dimension of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale – Self Report (LSAS-SR; ; ). The scale is broken down into social interaction anxiety (12 items, e.g., “Talking with people you don’t know very well”) and performance anxiety (12 items, e.g., “Participating in small groups”). Participants were asked to indicate how anxious they would feel in each situation on a Likert scale ranging from 0 = “not at all” to 3 = “very much so”.\n\nSome LSAS-SR items were adapted to respect local laws/norms in Saudi Arabia. Specifically, “Drinking with others” was reworded to “Drinking coffee with others”, “Urinating in a public bathroom” was changed to “Using a public bathroom”, and “Trying to make someone’s acquaintance for the purpose of a romantic/sexual relationship” was changed to “Making someone’s acquaintance for the purpose of making a marriage proposal”.\n\nIntolerance of Uncertainty. Intolerance of uncertainty was measured using the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale – Short Form (IUS-SF; ). The scale contains 2 subscales, Prospective Anxiety and Inhibitory Anxiety, each with 6 items. The Prospective Anxiety subscale includes statements such as, “The smallest doubt can stop me from acting”. The Inhibitory Anxiety subscale includes statements such as, “It frustrates me not having all the information I need”. Participants were asked to indicate how characteristic each item is of them on a Likert scale ranging from 1 = “not at all characteristic of me” to 5 = “entirely characteristic of me”.\n\nCreativity/Non-Creativity Anxiety. Creativity/Non-Creativity Anxiety was measured using the Creativity Anxiety Scale (). The scale contains 16 items: 8 creativity anxiety items (e.g., “Having to solve a problem for which the solution is open-ended”) paired with 8 non-creativity items (e.g., “Working in a situation where there is an established correct and incorrect way of doing things”). Participants were asked to indicate how much each situation would make them feel anxious on a Likert scale ranging from 0 = “not at all” to 4 = “very much”.\n\nAn attention check was also included in this scale, which asked participants to “Please select ‘2 – a little’ for this question”.\n\nAnalytic Thinking. Analytic thinking was measured using a revised version of the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; ), developed by Shenhav et al. (). We selected a revised version because participants were less likely to be familiar with it than the original. Like the original, the revised CRT contains three word-problems, each of which requires a numerical response. Questions are open-ended, but respondents typically give either the correct response (indicating greatest analytic thinking), a single incorrect and intuitively compelling response, or varying incorrect and unintuitive responses. The data set contains the raw numerical responses given by participants so that researchers can code them according to their chosen criteria.\n\nParticipants were also asked, “You have just answered three reasoning problems. How many of them do you think you answered correctly?” and – to help ensure the integrity of the revised CRT – “You have just answered three reasoning problems. Did you look any of the answers up online?”, to which they could respond “Yes” or “No”.\n\nBelief in God/s. Participants’ belief in God/s was recorded using a single item. Participants were asked, “How strongly do you believe in God (or gods) from 0–100? If you are certain that God (or gods) does not exist, then enter “0” and if you are certain that God (or gods) does exist then enter “100”.” Possible responses ranged between 0 and 100.\n\nSelf-Efficacy. Self-efficacy was measured with the 8-item New General Self Efficacy Scale (NGSE; ), which contains items such as “When facing difficult tasks, I am certain that I will accomplish them”. Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with each statement on a Likert scale of 1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree”.\n\nAn attention check was also included in this scale which asked participants to “Please select ‘4 – agree’ for this question”.\n\nPersistence. Persistence was measured with the persistence subscale of the Attitude Towards Mathematics Survey (ATMS; ), which contains 8 items such as “If I have trouble understanding a problem, I go over it again until I understand it”. Although the ATMS as a whole focusses on mathematics, the persistence subscale items refer to academic persistence more generally. Some items were modified to make them more appropriate for the higher education context. Specifically, in item 3 the words “in the book” were removed, in item 6 the words “hope that the teacher explains it” were changed to “hope that it is explained”, and the word “homework” was removed from items 2, 7, and 8. Item 4, “If I have trouble solving a homework problem in the book, I copy down the answer in the back of the book if it is available”, was removed because the required modifications would have changed the meaning too far from the original. All items except 1 and 7 are reverse scored. Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with each statement on a Likert scale of 1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree”.\n\nAn attention check was also included in this scale, which asked participants to “Please select ‘4 – agree’ for this question”.\n\nMathematics Education. Participants were asked for their highest level of pre-university mathematics education (GCSE or A Level or international equivalents), the grade they received at each level, and how long ago (in months) they took each qualification. These questions were modified for the local context of each partner university and, consequently, some include additional questions (see codebook for full details). Note that grades are in their raw form and will need to be standardised before they can be compared.\n\nStatistics Grades (Self-Reported). We asked participants whether they had previously taken any university-level statistics modules and, for those that had, to self-report their grades for these modules. Grades are in their raw form, but we also provide grading scale/system information for each university to enable standardisation (see Grade Data, below).\n\nDegree Course Details. Participants were asked to indicate their university, (intended) major subject of study (i.e., the subject of the degree that they are pursuing), their current year of study, and whether they were studying any other (i.e., non-statistics) mathematics-based modules on their degree. Where the local researchers already knew these details (e.g., they were only sharing the survey with their own students) these questions were omitted to reduce the length of the survey and the information was instead added into the data during data processing.\n\nDemographics. Participants were also invited to provide their age (in years), gender identity, ethnicity, and whether they have been diagnosed with a specific learning difference (SpLD), such as dyslexia or dyscalculia.\n\nAttention Check. In addition to the attention checks embedded within the measurement scales, participants were presented with the following at the end of the survey: “Please indicate whether you feel you have answered the previous questions carefully and truthfully. Answering ‘yes’ will ensure that your data is included in our analyses. Answering ‘no’ will mean that your data is excluded from our analyses but will have no impact upon you (i.e., you will still earn your incentive for taking part)”. Participants could respond “Yes, I have answered all questions carefully and truthfully” or “No, I have not answered the questions carefully and truthfully”.\n\nSurvey Metadata. The dataset also contains selected metadata that was automatically collected by Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT), which researchers may find useful. Specifically, we include the percentage of the survey completed, the time it took to complete the survey, and the dates participants began and finished the survey."
