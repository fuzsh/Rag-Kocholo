        "text": "See the Assessment section of the Aphasia Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspectives.\n\nAssessment can be static (i.e., using procedures designed to describe current levels of functioning within relevant domains) and/or dynamic (i.e., an ongoing process using hypothesis testing procedures to identify potentially successful intervention and support procedures).\n\nAssessment protocols can include both standardized and nonstandardized tools and data sources. See ASHA’s resource on assessment tools, techniques, and data sources as well as ASHA’s Preferred Practice Patterns for the Profession of Speech-Language Pathology: Spoken and Written Language Assessment—Adults.\n\nWhen conducting screening and assessment for people with aphasia, SLPs consider several factors, including the following:\n\nlanguage(s) and dialect(s) used\n\nconcurrent motor speech impairment (i.e., dysarthria, apraxia)\n\npresence of limb apraxia and/or oral apraxia\n\nhearing status and auditory agnosia (inability to process sound meaning)\n\nconcurrent cognitive impairment\n\nvisual acuity deficits, visual agnosia, and visual field cuts\n\nupper extremity hemiparesis (may affect the ability to write, point, and gesture)\n\npresence of chronic pain from either preexisting or new conditions\n\npresence or history of mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression)\n\nendurance and fatigue (testing may need to be broken into shorter sessions)\n\nThese factors may have an impact on screening and assessment and are considered during the evaluation. For example, if the individual with aphasia wears glasses (prescription or nonprescription), hearing aids, or dentures, then these devices should be worn during assessment if applicable prescriptions are still appropriate. Hearing and/or visual deficits may exist prior to the onset of aphasia or may be present as a result of the neurological event that caused aphasia. Physical or environmental modifications (e.g., large-print material, modified lighting, amplification devices) may assist SLPs with diagnosing language deficits in the presence of such co-occurring factors.\n\nFor people who use more than one language, it is important for the SLP to consider the age of acquisition of each language, the premorbid use of each language, and the language(s) needed for return to daily activities when selecting the language(s) and materials for assessment. Clinicians should gather data in all languages used to determine the degree of functional impact, keeping in mind that different languages may be impacted to varying degrees. Please see ASHA’s resource on working with bilingual clients with aphasia.\n\nDocumentation should include a description of any modifications and/or accommodations made to the testing process to reconcile cultural and linguistic variations, hearing and/or visual deficits, or other factors that may impact screening or comprehensive assessment. Any modifications and/or accommodations should also be considered when reporting assessment results (e.g., standardized scores may be impacted by modifications to assessment materials).\n\nFor further information, please see Murray and Chapey (2001) as well as ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Adult Hearing Screening; Dysarthria in Adults; Acquired Apraxia of Speech; Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology; Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators; and Cultural Responsiveness. See also ASHA’s resource on cognitive-communication.\n\nScreening\n\nScreening is a procedure for identifying the need for further assessment and does not provide a detailed description of the diagnosis, severity, and characteristics of aphasia. Screening is a valuable tool that helps health care providers make appropriate referrals to speech-language pathology services. Screening is conducted in the language(s) used by the person, with sensitivity to cultural and linguistic diversity.\n\nScreenings are completed by the SLP, the speech-language pathology assistant, or other trained professionals. Standardized and nonstandardized methods are used to screen oral motor functions, speech production, expressive and receptive language, cognitive communication, and hearing.\n\nScreening may result in\n\na recommendation for monitoring;\n\na recommendation for comprehensive speech, language, swallowing, or cognitive-communication assessments; and/or\n\na referral for other examinations or services.\n\nComprehensive Assessment\n\nConsistent with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework (ASHA, 2016; WHO, 2001), a comprehensive assessment is conducted to identify and describe\n\nimpairments in body structure and function, including underlying weaknesses in expressive and receptive language that affect communication performance;\n\ncomorbid deficits, such as other health conditions and medications that can affect communication performance;\n\nlimitations in activity and participation, including changes in, and impact on, functional status in communication and interpersonal interactions;\n\nenvironmental and personal factors that serve as barriers to, or facilitators of, successful communication and life participation; and\n\nthe impact of communication impairments on quality of life, functional limitations relative to the individual’s premorbid social roles, and the impact on their community.\n\nSee Person-Centered Focus on Function: Aphasia [PDF] for an example of assessment data consistent with the ICF. See also Counting What Counts: A Framework for Capturing Real-Life Outcomes of Aphasia Intervention [PDF] for a model of how to capture real-life outcomes in assessment and intervention.\n\nTypical Components of Aphasia Assessment\n\nCase History\n\nInclude information from medical records, self-reports/interviews, or clinician observations, such as the following:\n\nmedical history and recent medical status, including vision and hearing\n\nmental health history\n\neducation and health literacy level\n\nwork history\n\nhobbies and personal interests\n\ncultural and linguistic backgrounds\n\ntypical communication environments (e.g., where, how, and why someone communicates)\n\nknowledge of aphasia and communication strategies\n\nperception of functional communication status\n\ncurrent status and the desired outcome of engagement with varied communication partners and home, vocational, and community-based activities\n\nlanguage(s) used in various communication environments\n\npreferences and goals\n\nMotor Speech Examination\n\nFacilitate a differential diagnosis of apraxia and dysarthria through an assessment of articulatory processes, including rate, amplitude, accuracy, and consistency of movement. For further information, see ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Acquired Apraxia of Speech and Dysarthria in Adults.\n\nLanguage\n\nAssess expressive and receptive skills in spoken/signed and written language of increasing complexity across a variety of contexts (e.g., social, educational, vocational). Language assessment supports aphasia classification and identifies facilitating strategies.\n\nSpecific language skills to consider include the following:\n\nword, sentence, and paragraph comprehension (spoken/signed and written)\n\nnaming\n\nrepetition\n\nspontaneous speech\n\ndiscourse\n\nword, sentence, and paragraph writing\n\ngestures\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal resource, Language in Brief for additional language domains to consider when testing. See also ASHA’s resource on assessment tools, techniques, and data sources.\n\nEnvironmental and Personal Factors\n\nInclude factors that may impact treatment and recovery, such as\n\nsupport from family, care partners, and the community;\n\ncommunication partners’ knowledge of, and capacity to use, facilitating strategies;\n\nfeasibility and acceptance of compensatory strategies;\n\npersonal capacity to return to the previous level of engagement and communication ability;\n\nsocial determinants of health that impact access to services; and\n\ncomorbidities such as cognitive impairments, visual and motor impairments, depression, and/or other chronic conditions.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n\nThe identification and differential diagnosis of co-occurring impairments (e.g., cognitive-communication deficits, dysarthria, or acquired apraxia of speech) aid in planning an appropriate treatment plan. Clinicians consider the severity and subtype of aphasia (e.g., Broca’s, Wernicke’s, anomic) in addition to the functional impact of the communication disorder when selecting intervention strategies and counseling patients and their care partners. Please see the National Aphasia Association’s page on aphasia definitions for further details.\n\nLanguage and cognition are separate but overlapping skills. Deficits in one area may not impact the other; therefore, SLPs should remain aware that the presence of aphasia does not imply cognitive deficits. Please see ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Acquired Apraxia of Speech and Dysarthria in Adults and ASHA’s resource on cognitive-communication for further information.\n\nAssessment Results\n\nAssessment may result in one or more of the following:\n\ndiagnosis of a language or other communication disorder (e.g., dysarthria, acquired apraxia of speech, cognitive-communication disorder)\n\ndescription of the characteristics, severity, and functional impact of the language disorder\n\nprognosis for change (in the individual or in relevant contexts)\n\nrecommendations for intervention, support, and community resources\n\na referral for other assessments or services\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Aphasia Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspectives.\n\nAphasia treatment is individualized to address the specific areas of need identified during assessment, including goals identified by the person with aphasia and their care partners.\n\nPerson- and family-centered care is a collaborative approach grounded in a partnership between the person with aphasia, their care partners and support network, and their clinicians. Each party is equally important in the relationship, and each party respects the knowledge, skills, and experiences that the others bring to the process. This approach to care incorporates individual and family preferences, interests, and priorities in developing a treatment plan, including selecting targets and materials that are salient and culturally responsive to the individual. It represents a range of services, including counseling and emotional support, providing information and resources, coordinating services, and teaching specific skills to facilitate communication. See ASHA’s resource on person- and family-centered care.\n\nThis holistic, person-centered approach is consistent with the WHO’s (2001) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, with the overarching goal of intervention to help the individual achieve the highest level of function for participation in daily living.\n\nIntervention is designed to\n\ncapitalize on strengths and address weaknesses related to underlying structures and functions that affect communication across partners, activities, and settings;\n\nfacilitate the individual’s activities and participation by teaching new skills and compensatory strategies to both the individual with aphasia and their partner(s); and\n\nmodify contextual factors that serve as barriers and enhance those that facilitate successful communication and participation—including accommodations such as large print, pictures, and aphasia-friendly formatting to support comprehension of written health materials (e.g., T. A. Rose et al., 2003, 2011).\n\nSee ASHA’s resource, Person-Centered Focus on Function: Aphasia [PDF], for an example of functional goals consistent with the ICF.\n\nCommunity awareness of aphasia can be improved when clinicians provide education and outreach (Simmons-Mackie et al., 2011). Clinicians also foster such community support and integration by partnering with people with aphasia to reduce or remove communication barriers to accessing their communities. This may be addressed by supporting the individual’s communication skills, training conversational partners, and advocating for change and access to communication supports in the community. Examples include aphasia-friendly signage or menus in cafés, training first responders about supported communication strategies, and reducing background noise when possible.\n\nCommunity aphasia groups can help support work that is done within the clinical setting. These groups can provide treatment and support for people with aphasia, which can improve linguistic functioning in a naturalistic setting (Elman, 2016; Elman & Bernstein-Ellis, 1999; Lanyon et al., 2013) and enhance social networks (Vickers, 2010). Community groups may also offer individuals and family members an opportunity to socialize; share ideas and feelings; receive support; and learn more about aphasia and aphasia resources, including opportunities to participate in research.\n\nThere are several models in use that consider the functional impact of aphasia. These models include the following.\n\nThe Living With Aphasia: Framework for Outcome Measurement (A-FROM) model was designed to identify important categories that represent the individualized functional impact of aphasia. A-FROM incorporates components of other models, including the ICF, into a simple program to organize outcomes. A-FROM uses the following domains, which overlap to represent an individual’s experience of living with aphasia (Kagan et al., 2008):\n\naphasia severity\n\nparticipation/life habits\n\npersonal factors, including identity and emotions\n\nenvironment\n\nThe Life Participation Approach to Aphasia (LPAA) considers an intervention that emphasizes achieving or reengaging in life (Chapey et al., 2000; Lyon, 1992). This is done by focusing on the specific life concerns of the person with aphasia, with the overall goal of strengthening daily participation in activities of choice. The LPAA often focuses on long-term management of aphasia. Although LPAA approaches have traditionally taken place at home and in the community, the principles can be applied in any setting and at any stage of recovery from aphasia. Clinicians may choose to incorporate LPAA principles alongside other restorative or compensatory treatments.\n\nPlanning Treatment\n\nSocial and Cultural Factors\n\nViews on the natural aging process and understanding of disability vary by culture. Cultural views and preferences may not be consistent with medical approaches typically used in the U.S. health care system. It is essential that clinicians acknowledge and incorporate the perspective of the person with aphasia and their care partner(s) when sharing potential treatment recommendations and outcomes. Clinical interactions should be approached with cultural responsiveness. Consider dialectal and cultural background when choosing stimulus items and providing models for expressive language.\n\nClinicians consider social determinants of health—the nonmedical factors that impact health outcomes—as they plan the evaluation and treatment for aphasia with clients and their care partners. Clinicians consider the impact of a person’s communication on their ability to\n\nmaintain their employment or participate in school;\n\naccess general and specialty care, including pharmacy and medical supply services; and\n\naccess the features of the neighborhoods where they live and receive care, including access to healthy food, exercise, and social supports within their communities.\n\nThe goal of treatment is often to improve people’s ability to communicate effectively in all the environments in which they live, work, play, and worship. For further information, please see Commission on Social Determinants of Health (2008).\n\nLinguistic Factors\n\nRecovery of language may vary depending on the type of aphasia, how languages were acquired (simultaneously or sequentially), the degree of proficiency in each language, and demands for the use of each language. SLPs consider the language(s) that an individual uses in their home as well as in other environments (e.g., social settings, work) when selecting the language(s) for treatment. Treatment occurs in the language(s) used by the person with aphasia—either by a bilingual SLP or through collaboration with interpreters, when necessary. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators. SLPs tailor treatment to meet the needs of each individual and to facilitate a return to functional communication. The goal of intervention might not be a full recovery of all the languages used.\n\nQuestions to consider when treating bilingual individuals with aphasia include the following:\n\nHow many languages does the person speak?\n\nAt what point did they learn English or another secondary language?\n\nWhen and with whom do they use each language?\n\nWhat language(s) are spoken at work, at home, and with family or friends?\n\nWhat language(s), if any, do they use to read and/or write?\n\nWhat languages and conversational environments are a priority for them?\n\nIn addition to considering these questions, clinicians may need to consult with another professional, such as a bilingual SLP, a cultural/language broker (a person trained to help the clinician understand the person’s cultural and linguistic background to optimize treatment), an interpreter, and/or a translator. The clinician may need to provide additional training about what types of errors might be expected; what information would be important to note (e.g., paraphasias, neologisms, absence of functors); and what kind of prompting should be used or avoided. An SLP will need to determine the language(s) of treatment and its impact on cross-language generalization (i.e., improvement in the language that is not directly addressed).\n\nSee the following ASHA Practice Portal pages: Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology; Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators; and Cultural Responsiveness.\n\nTreatment Techniques\n\nBrief descriptions of both general and specific treatment options for individuals with aphasia are provided below. This information is not exhaustive, nor does inclusion of any specific treatment approach imply endorsement from ASHA. Treatment can be restorative (i.e., aimed at improving or restoring impaired function) and/or compensatory (i.e., aimed at compensating for deficits not amenable to retraining).\n\nTreatment extenders—such as care partners, volunteers, and community members—may be trained to stimulate and support communication. This way, treatment extenders provide communication practice in the home and in the community; such practice encourages carryover of skills. Clinicians may also use technology tools, such as computer programs and apps, as part of a home program.\n\nExpressive Language Treatments\n\nConstraint-Induced Language Therapy (CILT) — a treatment approach that focuses on increasing spoken language output while discouraging (constraining) the use of compensatory communication strategies (e.g., gesturing and writing). CILT also involves high-intensity training via massed practice (Pulvermüller et al., 2001). The principles and techniques of CILT are derived from constraint-induced movement therapy in which the use of a less-affected limb is restrained while, at the same time, training movements of the affected limb using intensive treatment (Taub et al., 1993; Taub & Wolf, 1997).\n\nMelodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) — a therapy program that uses melodic concepts (i.e., pitch, rhythm, and stress) to improve expressive language by engaging the right hemisphere of the brain. It is often used to treat individuals with severe nonfluent expressive language deficits who have relatively intact receptive language skills (Albert et al., 1973; Norton et al., 2009). Individuals begin by intoning simple phrases and then gradually increasing syllable length and length of utterance. Visual and tactile cues are given by the clinician, and phrases of social and functional importance to the individual (e.g., “I love you”) are practiced. Reliance on intonation is gradually decreased over time.\n\nPhonological Components Analysis (PCA) — a phonologically based treatment approach modeled after semantic feature analysis (see below). In PCA, a participant is presented with a picture and is asked to complete five phonological tasks related to the word that the picture represents. The individual is asked to state the following:\n\nwords the word rhymes with\n\nwhat sound the word starts with\n\nanother word that begins with the same sound\n\nwhat sound the word ends with\n\nthe number of syllables in the word\n\nIf the individual is not able to complete one of the components above, then they are given a choice from a list of up to three. After the individual completes all the above elements, the clinician asks them to state the target word (Leonard et al., 2008, 2014; van Hees et al., 2013).\n\nResponse Elaboration Training (RET) — a treatment approach designed to improve spoken language by increasing the number of content words in persons with aphasia. The goal of RET is to generalize elaboration abilities so that the person can more fully participate in conversations with a communication partner (Kearns, 1986; Wambaugh et al., 2013).\n\nA typical RET sequence consists of the following:\n\nThe person with aphasia responds verbally to a prompt (e.g., picture stimulus).\n\nThe clinician provides reinforcement and then shapes and models the person’s response.\n\nThe clinician gives a “wh–” cue to elicit an elaborated response.\n\nThe clinician reinforces attempts to elaborate and shapes and models the original response + the elaborated response.\n\nThe person attempts to repeat the clinician’s combined model.\n\nThe clinician elicits a delayed imitation of the combined model.\n\nSemantic Feature Analysis (SFA) — a word retrieval treatment in which the person with aphasia identifies important semantic features of a target word that is difficult to retrieve. For example, if the person has difficulty retrieving the word “stove,” they might be prompted with questions to provide information related to “stove” (e.g., “Where is it located?” “What is it used for?”). SFA is thought to improve word retrieval by activating the semantic network associated with the target word, thereby increasing the likelihood that a particular word will be retrieved (Boyle, 2004; Maher & Raymer, 2004).\n\nScript Training — a functional approach to aphasia treatment that uses script knowledge (understanding, remembering, and recalling event sequences of an activity) to facilitate participation in personally relevant activities. Using this approach, the clinician and the person with aphasia develop a scripted monologue or dialogue of an activity of interest and then practice it intensely until production of the scripted speech becomes automatic and effortless (Holland et al., 2002).\n\nSentence Production Program for Aphasia (SPPA) — a treatment program designed to aid in the production of specific sentence types. The SPPA is based on the concept that the production of certain sentence types will improve if the person with aphasia hears and produces multiple sentences with the same syntactic form but different lexical content.\n\nA story completion task is used to practice eight different sentence structures. There are two task levels per Helm-Estabrooks and Nicholas (2000):\n\nLevel A — The clinician reads a story that includes the target sentence and then asks a question to elicit repetition of that sentence.\n\nLevel B — The clinician reads the story without the target sentence and asks a question to elicit that sentence.\n\nTreatment of Underlying Forms (TUF) — a linguistic approach to treating sentence-level deficits in persons with agrammatic aphasia. TUF is designed to improve sentence production by training more complex sentence structures first, assuming that understanding the linguistic properties of these complex sentences will generalize to less complex sentences that share similar properties (Thompson & Shapiro, 2005).\n\nVerb Network Strengthening Treatment (VNeST) — an aphasia treatment to promote lexical retrieval in sentence context. VNeST targets verbs and their roles to activate semantic networks and to improve the production of basic syntactic structures (e.g., subject–verb–object). For example, the person with aphasia is given a verb (e.g., “paint”) and is asked to retrieve related agents and objects (e.g., “artist–paints–picture” and “painter–paints–house”; Edmonds & Babb, 2011; Edmonds & Mizrahi, 2011; Edmonds et al., 2009).\n\nWord Retrieval Cuing Strategies (e.g., phonological and semantic cueing) — an approach that provides additional information, such as phonological cueing (providing the beginning sound of a word) or semantic cueing (providing contextual cues) to prompt word recall (e.g., Wambaugh et al., 2002; Webster & Whitworth, 2012).\n\nWriting Treatments\n\nCopy and Recall Treatment (CART) — a protocol that uses picture and/or written presentations of a given word to engage spelling and then reinforcing that spelling through repetition. A CART sequence consists of the following:\n\nThe clinician shows a picture to a patient. If the participant spells the pictured word correctly, the clinician moves to the next item. If the participant spells it incorrectly, the clinician proceeds to Step 2.\n\nThe clinician shows the patient a handwritten word of the item shown in Step 1 and asks the patient to copy the word three times.\n\nThe clinician covers the written example, shows the picture again, and prompts recall of the spelling three times.\n\nIf the patient cannot demonstrate recall after several trials, then move to the next word.\n\nPlease see Copy and Recall Treatment (CART) Protocol [PDF] for a complete description of this protocol.\n\nReading Treatments\n\nMultiple Oral Re-Reading (MOR) — a treatment technique that involves re-reading text aloud—either for a specific number of times or until a specific reading rate is reached—in an effort to improve whole-word oral reading in the context of a text passage. MOR is best suited for individuals with preserved letter-by-letter reading abilities, relatively intact comprehension, and the ability to read aloud at the single-word level (see, e.g., Cherney, 2004; Kim & Russo, 2010; Moyer, 1979; Tuomainen & Laine, 1991).\n\nOral Reading for Language in Aphasia — a treatment that involves repeated practice reading sentences aloud with the clinician to improve reading comprehension via phonological and semantic reading routes. The use of connected discourse (sentences) rather than single words allows the individual to practice natural rhythm and intonation (Cherney, 1995; Cherney et al., 1986).\n\nSupported Reading Comprehension — approaches that incorporate aphasia-friendly text supports (e.g., drawings, personally relevant photographs, and reader-friendly formatting) and linguistic supports (e.g., headings and bolded text; see, e.g., Dietz et al., 2014; Knollman-Porter et al., 2016; T. A. Rose et al., 2003, 2011).\n\nPartner Approaches\n\nTreatment approaches that engage communication partners to facilitate improved communication in persons with aphasia include the following.\n\nConversational Coaching — a treatment designed to teach verbal and nonverbal communication strategies to individuals with aphasia and their primary communication partners (e.g., spouse, care partner). Strategies can include drawing, gesturing, cueing, confirming information, and summarizing information. Strategies are chosen by the individual and their communication partner and are practiced in scripted conversations. The SLP serves as the “coach” for both partners (Hopper et al., 2002).\n\nSupported Conversation for Adults With Aphasia — an approach to aphasia rehabilitation that emphasizes (a) the need for multimodal communication, (b) partner training, and (c) opportunities for social interaction. Per Kagan (2007), there are three underlying principles:\n\nFunctional communication can be facilitated/improved by teaching strategies to communication partners.\n\nCommunication is a dynamic process; tools and services for the person with aphasia must reflect this dynamic process.\n\nCommunication includes social interaction and the exchange of information and ideas; opportunities for social interaction are emphasized.\n\nSupporting Partners of People With Aphasia in Relationships and Conversation (SPPARC) — a participant-driven program that focuses on how people with aphasia and their communication partners act and react to each other during conversational exchanges. SPPARC is used to address communication breakdowns by recording and analyzing communication between conversational partners in a functional setting and then addressing issues in a clinical setting. This therapy approach has six steps (Lock et al., 2001), as follows:\n\npreparation\n\nrecording the conversation\n\npreliminary viewing of the recording and transcription\n\nconversation assessment\n\nmoving from assessment to training\n\nconversation training\n\nMultimodal Treatments\n\nTreatment approaches that use any modality to communicate a message. Multimodal treatments focus on using varied effective and efficient communication strategies and include the following.\n\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) — an area of clinical practice that supplements or compensates for impairments in speech-language production and/or comprehension, including spoken/signed and written modes of communication. AAC approaches incorporate low-tech strategies (e.g., photos, communication books) and high-tech devices to enhance communication. AAC focuses on using the individual’s residual language abilities and training communication partners to use “augmented input” to enhance comprehension and to offer written or visual choices to help individuals with aphasia indicate preferences, ideas, and feelings. Please see ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Augmentative and Alternative Communication for further information.\n\nGestural Facilitation of Naming — an approach that uses intact gesture abilities to facilitate the activation of word retrieval by taking advantage of the interactive nature of language and action (see, e.g., Raymer et al., 2006; Rodriguez et al., 2006; M. L. Rose, 2013; M. L. Rose et al., 2013, 2017).\n\nPromoting Aphasics’ Communicative Effectiveness — a treatment designed to improve conversational skills. The individual with aphasia and the clinician take turns being the message sender and the message receiver. Picture prompts for conversational messages are hidden from the listener (similar to a barrier task), and the speaker uses their choice of modalities for conveying messages (Davis & Wilcox, 1981).\n\nReciprocal Scaffolding Treatment — a group treatment approach that addresses communication skills using natural language in meaningful social contexts. An individual with aphasia is given an opportunity to use premorbid knowledge and vocabulary to teach a skill to a group of “novices.” The person with aphasia has an opportunity to convey knowledge to the novices, and the novices, in turn, learn a new skill and provide language models during realistic interactions (Avent & Austerman, 2003).\n\nVisual Action Therapy (VAT) — a nonverbal treatment approach that trains individuals to use hand gestures to represent items that are not present (Helm-Estabrooks et al., 1982). VAT incorporates a 12-step training hierarchy beginning with tracing (e.g., tracing objects); then matching objects; then producing pantomimed gestures for visible objects; and, finally, producing pantomimed gestures for absent objects.\n\nService Delivery\n\nSee the Service Delivery section of the Aphasia Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspectives.\n\nIn addition to determining the optimal treatment approach for individuals with aphasia, other factors include the availability of specific types of services in a particular region, insurance coverage, pattern of recovery, and service delivery options, including the following:\n\nformat—structure of the treatment session (e.g., group vs. individual)\n\nprovider—person providing the treatment (e.g., SLP, trained volunteer, caregiver)\n\ndosage—frequency, intensity, and duration of service\n\ntiming—timing of intervention relative to the onset of aphasia\n\nsetting—location of treatment (e.g., home, community-based, telepractice)\n\nTreatment typically begins in the acute or rehabilitation inpatient setting and may continue in post-acute care. Treatment can occur in various formats or settings with the frequency, intensity, and duration of services based on the individualized treatment plan and progress. For example, in addition to one-on-one treatment, group treatment is often used to apply learned strategies in a more natural conversational context. Community-based programs (e.g., LPAA; Chapey et al., 2000) can be used to foster community integration and to provide peer support from other individuals with chronic aphasia. Intensive treatment/programs (e.g., intensive aphasia day treatment) may be used for a time-limited period.\n\nTechnology can also be incorporated into the delivery of services for aphasia when appropriate, including computer-based treatment programs and the use of telepractice to deliver face-to-face services remotely.
