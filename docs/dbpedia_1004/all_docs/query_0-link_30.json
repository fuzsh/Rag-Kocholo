        "text": "Julio Rodríguez always planned to be a star. He didn’t assume it would happen—but he knew the work he put in would land him there, and he wanted to be prepared.\n\nThat’s why, before he even played a professional game in the United States, he wanted to learn the language we spoke, to have a fully developed skill-set for stardom. And so he did.\n\nOne of the things I’m most proud of from my time at the Mariners—not because it was hard, just because it’ll be fun trivia to tell my future kids—is that I was the one asking the questions in Julio Rodríguez’s first-ever interview fully in English.\n\nHe didn’t have to—no player does. It’s not a huge deal, I did interviews on the same trip through an interpreter and it was just fine.\n\nBut learning English at that age, with so much going on in life, was just something he wanted to do because he thought would be useful. So he did.\n\nWhen the interview was over, I floated away. This kid, 17 years old, simultaneously a boyish teenager and exactly what a Major Leaguer looks like, was different.\n\nOf course, it helps to get lines like this.\n\nBefore I did the gig professionally, I was a Mariners fan. Like, that was at the core of doing the job and being decent at it—being a Mariners fanboy with enough social and digital chops to be dangerous.\n\nI could go on and on about how I knew then Julio could be The Dude. You could sense it. How I thought he could be an MVP-type and told buddies I worked with back in Seattle.\n\nThere’s nothing I can write though that’s going to effectively convey that feeling. Maybe, like, Vonnegut could do it justice.\n\nThat’d be hilarious, Kurt writing up the scene of me and a videographer interviewing a 17-year-old future superstar on metal bleachers at a mostly-empty Arizona complex so we could share a video on social media. Like some bizarro modern day Field of Dreams.\n\nAnyway, that’s enough of an attempt.\n\nI wrote this post because I’ve been thinking about it for a while, honestly for as long as the blog has existed.\n\nIn every sport, you hear so much about a player’s “makeup.” And it’s a dangerous game, with certain personality traits applied to certain demographics and unreliable narrators painting haphazardly with a brush dunked in confirmation bias.\n\nIt is rare that you can see, objectively and undeniably, that makeup show up in or on the field of play. But it does happen.\n\nThat is Julio Rodríguez and his elite defense at one of the game’s premium positions.\n\nI want to bring your attention to a few different blurbs.\n\nFrom Top 38 Prospects: Seattle Mariners, published by FanGraphs on May 17, 2021.\n\nHe also showed up for 2021 spring training having lost a bunch of weight and running a full grade better than he did in 2019 and ’20; he’s once again an average runner from home to first.\n\nAverage? Oh that’s so good to hear.\n\nFrom 2021 Seattle Mariners Midseason Top 30 Prospects Update in Baseball Prospectus, published July 29, 2021:\n\nThe only knock on Rodriguez is his occasional lack of focus on defense results in avoidable mistakes, but he has the physical tools to be at least an average defender.\n\nAt least average, they say? Great.\n\nFrom Seattle Mariners Top Prospects, published by Baseball Prospectus on January 26, 2022.\n\nDefensively, he’ll still be stretched if asked to man center field, but should be average or a tick above in a corner.\n\nStretched if asked to man center.\n\nThis is not a dunk. People love to dunk. I do, too. But we as a society are getting a little too aggressive with what we’re calling a dunk.\n\nThe people who write the prospect profiles above are talented evaluators. They know prospects a hell of a lot better than I do. They were wrong here, yes. It’s not important, but it is true.\n\nAnd though it is true, they were wrong because the situation materially changed. Julio changed it.\n\nShannon Drayer was the first to legitimately suggest Julio Rodríguez could be the organization’s center fielder of the future, that it even was already in the works.\n\nThat was in NOVEMBER OF 2021. Only four months before he’d begin his Rookie of the Year campaign—in center field.\n\nIn those four months, probably one or two prior, a lot of work. Substack’s being a pain and not letting me embed but if you followed Julio on Instagram, it was Story after Story. Constantly in the gym. A whole lot of speed-work.\n\nWe saw it in the regular season. Ichiro saw it even before that.\n\n“During his first spring training, I had the opportunity to run around with him, play catch and do all those things with him,” Ichiro said through interpreter Allen Turner on Wednesday afternoon at T-Mobile Park. “I realized he’s faster than he looks. He’s doesn’t look as fast as he really is. He’s really fast. He’s under control. He’s even-keel. So I knew he could play center. I thought that he was destined to be a center fielder.”\n\nSince his Major League debut, Julio Rodríguez is the seventh-best center fielder in the game by Outs Above Average. Since the beginning of last year, he’s fourth-best.\n\nThis year? Best defensive center fielder in the game.\n\nThe metrics are nice. The plays—the plays are nicer. The emotions they elicit, the romance of it all.\n\nYou can’t beat it.\n\nDefense wins you games. It makes you a more complete player. At a premium position like center? It tilts the field for the gloves around him and the pitching staff he plays behind.\n\nIt’s funny though, defense is often viewed as the dorkiest of all the stats. It’s the one people still tend to most overlook.\n\nIn the case of Julio, though, it comes from the most old-school trait there is. Makeup. Intangibles. Character.\n\nJulio wanted to get faster. He wanted to be a great center fielder. So he just…did it.\n\nIt’s why I tend not to worry too much about Julio.\n\nThe power bat may not be where he or we want it to be quite yet. But it’ll come.\n\nUntil then, he’s still a hell of a ball player to watch."
