        "text": "McDonald’s VP and global chief communications officer Sandy Rodriguez had no intention of ever working for a fast-food chain.\n\nBefore joining the Golden Arches in 2022, she spent nearly two decades holding executive comms roles within the pharma and healthcare industries. Rodriguez worked for 16 years at Takeda, most recently as VP of global integration and divestitures comms; and then spent the next two years as VP of comms at Roche Diagnostics during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShe was ready to relocate from Chicago to Roche’s headquarters in Indianapolis when McDonald’s approached her about a job. Rodriguez notes she initially didn’t answer the calls and wasn’t taking the opportunity “too seriously.”\n\nBut the recruiter told her to give McDonald’s a chance, explaining “it was a place where I would be able to get everything I had been wanting,” says Rodriguez. “I said, ‘How can that be? They serve burgers and fries.’”\n\nAfter Rodriguez learned about McDonald’s ​​purpose to drive global impact and the “significant” role the iconic quick-service restaurant chain has because of its reach, brand awareness and scale — serving 63 million customers every day around the globe — she changed her mind.\n\n“If they make one small change, think about the significant impact that can have,” says Rodriguez. “That resonated with me and made me say, ‘This is it. This is the place I need to go next.’”\n\nThe evolution of global impact\n\nRodriguez officially started at McDonald’s in May 2022 as VP of U.S. communications. Less than a year later, in April 2023, she was promoted to her current role, reporting to EVP and global chief impact officer Jon Banner.\n\nThe global impact team was formed in 2020. The function encompasses comms, government relations and public policy, DE&I, sustainability and social impact, global intelligence and security and Ronald McDonald House Charities.\n\n“The whole idea was [that] it was important to put these functions together because this was the way this function would be moving the needle on reputation and drive responsible growth,” says Rodriguez.\n\nOver the past year, the global impact team spent time “making sure we are clear on why we are all together, and [that] we wanted to truly understand the value of the different groups existing under one [umbrella],” says Rodriguez. The team’s focus, she says, is “making McDonald's famous for our impact on people and the planet [by articulating] these are the areas where McDonald’s is leading.”\n\nThe CCO’s contributions to the impact cause are certainly appreciated. “[Rodriguez’s] exceptional strategic acumen allows her to bring both foresight and a relentless pursuit of flawless execution to the work,” says Banner. “Her deep knowledge, humility and emotional intelligence have become invaluable assets to McDonald’s global impact team.”\n\nSustainability is a big part of the team’s efforts. The Science Based Targets initiative has validated McDonald’s global 2050 net-zero emission reduction target, aligning its 2030 global emissions target to help keep global temperature rises below 1.5°C.\n\nHowever, last August, McDonald’s quietly removed the term “ESG” from some parts of its website at a time when environmental, social and governance initiatives have been attracting criticism from some conservative policymakers in the U.S.\n\n“Global impact’s focus on people and planet and sustainability is a big part of our efforts,” says Rodriguez. “We will talk more about our global 2050 net zero reduction targets. That is part of how we do business. We will continue to stay committed to that.”\n\nMcDonald’s has continued its efforts to diversify its global franchisees, launching in 2021 a $250 million investment over five years in the U.S., to provide alternatives to traditional financing, helping candidates who may face socioeconomic barriers to joining the QSR chain.\n\n\"McDonald's embraces diversity as an advantage and is working to create opportunities for employees, franchisees, suppliers, customers and communities,\" says Rodriguez.\n\nIt is also leveraging opportunities such as conferences and engagement events to meet and mentor more new and diverse-owned businesses that seek to join its network, \"building our pipeline of diverse-owned suppliers and supporting them to better meet McDonald’s requirements,\" adds Rodriguez.\n\nAdditionally, McDonald’s relaunched its Chicago Community Impact Grants programs, which provides help to local nonprofits working to reduce barriers to employment and education for Black and Latino youth in the city’s South and West sides.\n\nA relatable brand\n\nRight around the time Rodriguez was named CCO, the Grimace Birthday Meal launched, featuring a limited-edition purple shake inspired by the brand mascot’s iconic color and sweetness.\n\nAlthough Grimace has been around for 50 years, McDonald’s hadn’t used the mascot as part of its marketing for a long time.\n\nThe shake inspired a viral trend, with thousands of consumers posting elaborate videos on social media pretending to be poisoned after drinking it.\n\n“I was doing meet and greets with different outlets and reporters,” says Rodriguez. “I was preparing to talk about all sorts of things, but every reporter just wanted to talk about the Grimace Shake.”\n\nThis is just another way people can relate to the brand, she says, adding that most people have a memory of going to McDonald’s, whether for a birthday party or a first date.\n\nFor Rodriguez, that memory is her father picking her up from school and taking her to the fast-food chain, where she would have a Happy Meal Cheeseburger and he would have a Quarter Pounder with Cheese. Side note: Her current favorite McDonald’s order is McNuggets because she wants to try the different sauces.\n\n“The Grimace Shake was a wonderful way for people to have something to talk about and connect it back to a way they experienced McDonald’s, but also a way to connect with the new generation,” says Rodriguez.\n\nHer own daughters, aged 15 and 20, first informed her about the Grimace Shake trend.\n\n“They wanted anything Grimace available,” says Rodriguez. “They asked if I could bring home something Grimace-related because they wanted to wear it and show they are cool.”\n\nMcDonald’s brought back another mascot from days of yore — the Hamburglar — in January to promote its new and improved hamburgers.\n\nAsked if other older mascots will make a comeback, Rodriguez notes: “We are always listening to our customers and stay tuned.”\n\nNew restaurant formats\n\nAnother example of McDonald’s innovation is its expansion with CosMc’s, a new, small-format, space-themed, beverage- and breakfast-focused restaurant concept. By the end of the year, it plans to open approximately 10 CosMc’s pilot locations, including spots in the Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio, Texas, metro areas.\n\n“That’s a good example of why I am excited to work here,” says Rodriguez. “It’s about demonstrating why McDonald’s is so in tune with what is going on and what our consumers are asking about. We are willing to take on the next challenge because our customers are asking for it.”\n\nComms played a key part in how and when CosMc’s was rolled out.\n\n“We were able to be at the table, help inform strategy, be a partner to the business and tell a great story about what CosMc’s is and what it represents for McDonald’s,” says Rodriguez.\n\n“You saw the rollout and the long lines. We were able to share that at the investor day [on December 6], and it was the great partnership between comms and other teams [that influenced] how that story evolved over time.”\n\nAnother of Rodriguez’s favorites from the last six months was the chain’s campaign highlighting that 1 in 8 Americans has worked at McDonald’s.\n\nOpportunities ahead for comms\n\nIn her current position, Rodriguez oversees 72 people. She leads McDonald’s Communications Global Center of Excellence across external and internal, overseeing brand trust, external engagement and media relations, enterprise and employee comms and reputational measurement.\n\n“I’m fortunate to have members of my team who are dedicated to making sure they get data so we can make decisions that aren’t based on emotion,” says Rodriguez. “That allows us to be more concrete in what we recommend to the organization or bring forward.”\n\nShe also oversees crisis communications and professional development for all communicators across the company; and Story Lab, which is McDonald’s digital and social channels.\n\n“They push us to make sure what we are saying will resonate with our audiences — that we are on top of what is trending now — and make sure we are getting the right information across,” says Rodriguez. “At a time when misinformation and disinformation is so prevalent, this group is even more important.” Her team co-creates playbooks and narratives that markets and functions can localize to drive reputation with external stakeholders, including media outlets, as well as employee engagement.\n\nAdditionally, Agency 123, McDonald’s in-house creative agency, sits within comms. “They are a strategic arm of our function and help us bring a story to life,” Rodriguez says.\n\nAlthough McDonald’s is in a position of strength as a “leading QSR company and leading consumer facing brand,” the company still thinks about how it needs to evolve to remain relevant.\n\nThe chain reported Q4 net income of $2.04 billion, up from $1.9 billion a year earlier. Net sales rose 8% to $6.41 billion in the final reporting period of last year.\n\nMcDonald’s growth strategy, Accelerating the Arches, is working, says Rodriguez. It is focused on maximizing marketing, committing to core products and doubling down on delivery, digital, drive-thru and development.\n\n“There is a lot of change happening in the world,” she says. “We have to evolve how we are serving our customers and be more focused on how we engage with them digitally.”\n\nThe comms team is making sure it has a strong narrative in place and equipping McDonald’s leaders to tell that story.\n\n“You can get a great start and form a career where maybe you will own your own McDonald’s one day or end up working on the corporate side,” she explains. “But there are foundational skills you get at a McDonald’s you can take elsewhere.”\n\nAlthough it took a while for Rodriguez to understand the appeal of working for McDonald’s, she now believes there is a lot of “pride” in being connected with the iconic brand. “It is a great story to tell,” she says."
