        "text": "Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves (born July 7, 1848, Guaratinguetá, near São Paulo, Braz.—died Jan. 16, 1919, Rio de Janeiro) was the president of Brazil from 1902 to 1906, generally considered one of the outstanding civilian holders of that office.\n\nFirst elected to public office in 1872, Rodrigues Alves was president of São Paulo state in 1900–02 and 1912–16. During his term as Brazil’s president, Rio de Janeiro was extensively rebuilt and aesthetically improved, and the city’s public health was drastically reformed, eliminating yellow fever. Through his foreign minister, José Maria da Silva Paranhos, border disputes were settled peacefully with Bolivia, Uruguay, British Guiana, and Suriname (Dutch Guiana). In 1918 Rodrigues Alves was reelected president of Brazil but died before he could take office."
