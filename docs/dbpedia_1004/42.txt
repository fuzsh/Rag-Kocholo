About 90% of the population are Creole, descendants of Malagasy and African slaves. The Catholic faith is predominant in Rodrigues, with Anglicans, Adventists, Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists also represented.

Activities

Rodrigues offers a range of fun and exciting activities, from hiking and day cruises to neighbouring islets to ziplining, diving and much more. Diving is truly the premier activity of the island as it is home to some of the most breathtaking coral reefs and marine life in the world. The underwater world of the island is a natural wonder of the Indian Ocean, full of brightly coloured endemic fish and a rich variety of corals. There are numerous caves, tunnels and canyons for the fish to weave in and out of, and some of the large species you might see include Tuna, Sharks, Jackfish, Barracudas and Kingfish. The best period for diving is during the summer when visibility is best and diving is possible both inside and outside the lagoon.

Day trips to Ile aux Cocos, a stunning small island nature reserve located 4 km to the west of Rodrigues is also a popular activity and is now one of the main tourist attractions of Rodrigues. The island has a long fine sandy beach and coconut and casuarinas trees are plentiful. The lagoon surrounding the island is shallow and in some areas the corals and rocks are visible above the water surface meaning it is possible to get a glimpse of the marine life from the boat itself. Cocos Island is also home to thousands of birds and during the summer up to 5,000 make their home there. Visits to the island require a permit which is usually obtained by your tour operator.

Entertainment

Entertainment such as cultural shows or live music are available at hotels, and the islandâs discos are also lively.

Health and Safety

There is no malaria on the island, but you should still take usual precautions against mosquito bites like applying anti-mosquito sprays or creams.

Drinking water is considered safe.

Take sensible precautions when travelling around the island, do not leave valuables unattended and try to avoid walking alone at night.

When swimming in the sea always check that the currents are safe and that there are no visible or hidden hazards.
