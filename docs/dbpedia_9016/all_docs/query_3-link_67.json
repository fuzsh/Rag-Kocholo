        "text": "Pretoria North at a glance\n\nFondly referred to as the greater Pretoria North for suburbs lying on that side of the Magaliesberg mountain range, Pretoria North actually exists as a suburb in its own right! It lies at the northern foothills of the mountain, which also marks the border between the city of Pretoria and the sub-tropically beautiful suburbs of the greater northern area.\n\nPretoria North serves both as a suburb for residents as well as an industrial hub and especially hosts a number of motor industry operations, panel beaters, car parts sales, mechanics as well as glass fitment centres. These are located along main access roads such as Gerrit Maritz, Rachel de Beer and Voortrekker streets. There are also a number of industries which are well contained within industrial parks such as the N4 Gateway Industrial Park, Kuper Legh Industrial Park, the Automotive Supplier as well as Loftus Park.\n\nFrom a homing and property point of view Pretoria North offers a great variety in choice. Bearing in mind that it is one of the oldest suburbs in northern Tshwane, it goes without saying that it still offers contemporary styled options - typically large stands with equally large houses, some up to 6 even 7 bedrooms - both suburban and on plots or small holdings.\n\nWith it being an older area, many houses have been renovated and re-designed allowing for a choice of both modern and old-fashioned architecture. There is a great variety in accommodation to suit residents across the board - apartments, complexes, townhouses, smaller and larger homes, plots, estates, retirement communities as well as vacant land. Serving such a variety of residents also indicates that Pretoria North allows for a varied range of household incomes, be it families with school going children, first-time homeowners or persons heading into retirement\n\nFor location, Pretoria North is particularly well located to a thriving industrial sector, the center of Pretoria a mere 10kms away and all amenities that most residents will require on a day-to-day basis.\n\nCLIMATE:\n\nPretoria North is tucked in right behind the Magaliesberg mountain range and enjoys some of the warmer temperatures on the northern side of Tshwane. It has the protection from the mountain and a truly sub-tropical climate, which is particularly great during the winter months as these are generally fairly comfortable.\n\nSummer days can be particularly hot but afternoon showers are the norm which helps in bringing evening temperatures down a little. Summer rains take place between September and February while winter does not experience rainfall, so the environment tends to become fairly dry and dreary for a few of the winter months. Mornings can be cold and at times there may be some frost, but as is typical in Tshwane, winter days become warmer toward the late morning and afternoons. Heading further north the environment eases into lowveld, even bushveld, vegetation.\n\nMAIN ACCESS ROUTES:\n\nThe main access roads in and out of Pretoria North are the R513 to the west which also leads to the N4 highway, while on the eastern side of Pretoria North lies both the M1 and R101 providing direct access to the centre or Pretoria. For access to the neighbouring suburbs of the greater Pretoria North, such as Sinoville and Montana the R513, Sefako Makgatho Drive (accessible via the R101), travels all the way through, eventually allowing access onto the N1 highway.\n\nDISTANCE FROM PRETORIA NORTH TO THE PRETORIA CBD:\n\nVia M1: 17 minutes / 12 kms\n\nDistances are approximate and drive times during normal traffic.\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST & ENTERTAINMENT IN THE AREA:\n\nAcro Branch Pretoria North\n\nBig Fig Tree at Wonderboom Nature Reserve\n\nBonacord Dam\n\nDinokeng Game Reserve\n\nFriends of the Rail\n\nGarland of Grace Tea Garden\n\nGo-karting at Kolonade Shopping Centre\n\nHartebeespoort Dam\n\nHarties Cable Cars\n\nMagaliesberg hiking trails\n\nMagic Company\n\nOnderstepoort Private Nature Reserve\n\nRonan Erasmus Dam\n\nRoodeplaat Dam\n\nTswaing Meteorite Crater & Centre\n\nWonderboom Nature Reserve\n\nWonderboom Airport\n\nZambibush Resort\n\nCHURCHES:\n\nAGS Church\n\nDie Gemeentes Van Christus - Pretoria Noord\n\nDie Gereformeerde Kerk Pretoria Noord\n\nEmpower Church\n\nEvangelies Gereformeerde Kerk, Maranata\n\nGood Shepherd Sisters\n\nKompas Noord\n\nNederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk, Onderstepoort\n\nPretoria North Baptist Church\n\nPretoria North Methodist Church\n\nSt. John The Baptist Catholic Church\n\nSt Mary's Anglican Church\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\nUnity of the Faith Assemblies The\n\nWord & Spirit\n\nCOMMUNITY SERVICES:\n\nPretoria North Police Station (Pretoria North)\n\nWonderboompoort Police Station (Wonderboompoort)\n\nFRAIL CARE & RETIREMENT FACILITIES:\n\nAvondrus Ouetehuis, retirement & doctor\n\nHuis Helpmekaar\n\nHuis Hermon, care for the aged\n\nResidentia Hermon\n\nCare Lodge Kamdebo, adult day care centre (Florauna)\n\nEden Aftreeoord (Theresapark)\n\nForever Loving Care Association Home for The Elderly, frail care (Wonderboom)\n\nJasmyn Aftreeoord (Wonderboom)\n\nHOSPITALS & MEDICAL FACILITIES:\n\nPretoria North Medicross\n\nPretoria North Medical Centre\n\nIntercare Wonderboom Medical & Dental Centre (Wonderboom)\n\nLife Eugene Marais Hospital (Les Marais)\n\nNetcare Akasia Hospital (Akasia)\n\nNetcare Bougainville Hospital\n\nNetcare Moot Hospital\n\nNURSERY & PRE-PRIMARY SCHOOLS:\n\nBlommetjieland\n\nDwergieland Nursery School\n\nHennie Pen Preschool\n\nKleuter Vreugde\n\nLittle Tree Day Care\n\nMega Kidz EdCare DayCare\n\nPRIMARY SCHOOLS:\n\nAssumption Convent Primary School\n\nLaerskool Danie Malan\n\nLaerskool Voortrekker Eeufees\n\nLaerskool Rachel de Beer\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS:\n\nHoërskool Gerrit Maritz\n\nHoërskool Pretoria-Noord\n\nPretoria North High School\n\nHillview High School (Roseville)\n\nHoërskool Wonderboom (Wonderboom)\n\nHoërskool Overkruin (Sinoville)\n\nSPECIAL NEEDS SCHOOLS:\n\nMagalies Special School (Rietfontein)\n\nRESTAURANTS:\n\nThe Lantern Coffee Bar and Take Away\n\nFiela se Pannekoek\n\nBaobab Café & Grill (Wonderboom)\n\nOcean Basket (Ninapark)\n\nShamrocks - Irish Pub and Restaurant (Ninapark)\n\nTawny Creek Spur Steak Ranch (Ninapark)\n\nThe Dak Shack (Wonderboom Airport)\n\nTranna (Wonderboom)\n\nVilla San Giovanni Ristorante (Wonderboom Airport)\n\nVilla San Giovanni Pizzeria & Terrace (Wonderboom Airport)\n\nSHOPPING MALLS:\n\nBlaauw Village Shopping Complex\n\nFlorauna Sentrum\n\nNorth Park Mall\n\nAnnlin Plaza (Annlin)\n\nKarenpark Crossing Shopping Centre (Karenpark)\n\nMadelief Shopping Centre (Dorandia)\n\nWonderboom Junction (Annlin)\n\nWonderpark Shopping Centre (Karenpark)\n\nSinoville Centre (Sinoville)\n\nZambezi Centre (Sinoville)\n\nVETERINARY CLINICS:"
