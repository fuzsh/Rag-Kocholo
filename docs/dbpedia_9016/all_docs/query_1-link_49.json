        "text": "Transcript\n\nDid You Know? How countries choose their capitals As the home of a country’s government, a capital city plays an important role in that country’s identity. But how does a country choose which city to make the capital?\n\nMany different factors, including location, can go into the decision. Capitals are often close to the middle of a country so that the capital isn’t likely to be, or seem to be, biased toward one region or another.\n\nFor example, in 1991, Nigeria decided to build its new capital of Abuja in its center to signal unity in the geographically divided and religiously diverse country.\n\nSometimes, countries choose an existing city as the capital, often picking a city that contains a substantial portion of the country’s population. Examples of such capitals include Lima, Peru, and Seoul, South Korea.\n\nOther times, countries build a completely new capital city. In 1960 Brazil relocated its capital from Rio de Janeiro to the newly built Brasília.\n\nLikewise, in 2019, Indonesia announced that its capital would be moved from Jakarta, because of overcrowding and environmental issues, to a brand-new city, later called Nusantara.\n\nCapitals can also result from political compromise. For example, the United States originally planned to have its permanent capital in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut in order to gain votes for his new economic plan, Alexander Hamilton proposed that the new capital should be located in the South between Virginia and Maryland—land that became Washington, D.C.\n\nSome countries even have multiple capitals. Bolivia has its constitutional capital in Sucre and its administrative capital in La Paz, while South Africa has its government spread across three capital cities: Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein.\n\nBut no matter how the city is chosen, a country’s capital becomes an important symbol that represents the entire country to the world."
