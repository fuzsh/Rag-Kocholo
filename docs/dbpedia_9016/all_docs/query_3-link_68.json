        "text": "Pretoria at a glance\n\nPretoria lies on the banks of the Apies River and rests at the foot of the majestic Magaliesberg range.

A notable landmark is the Union Buildings, the official government seat.\n\nWhile Pretoria moves at a slower pace than neighbouring Johannesburg, the city is thriving.

In the 1600s, the region around the river valley was originally inhabited by the southern Ndebele people. In 1855, the city was founded by Marthinus Pretorius, a Voortrekker leader and the first president of the South African Republic. Originating from two farms, Elandspoort and Koedoespoort, the then town was named 'Pretoria' after Marthinus's father, Andries Pretorius.\n\nAlthough Pretoria has a complex history involving events like the South African War (Anglo-Boer War) and Apartheid, it has become a shining beacon of South Africa's new democracy. Nelson Mandela, the country's first black president, was inaugurated at Pretoria's Union Buildings in 1994.\n\nToday, Pretoria has built a reputation as one of South Africa's most liveable cities. In 2014, the city was voted the best place to live in Gauteng in the Gauteng City-Region Observatory survey.\n\nClimate\n\nBecause Pretoria lies in a sheltered valley surrounded by the hills of the Magaliesberg range, you can expect warmer weather compared to Johannesburg. Ideal for sun-worshippers, the average temperature averages 28-29ºC during the summer months. Even in winter, the temperature can soar as high as 20ºC, ensuring you'll be able to enjoy all of the city's scenic spots.\n\nSchools in the area\n\nWith a variety of schools across Pretoria, you can guarantee your child's success.
