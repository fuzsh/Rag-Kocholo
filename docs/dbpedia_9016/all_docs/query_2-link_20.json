However Cape Town and Bloemfontein are official capital cities as well.\n\nThe Capitals of South Africa\n\nSouth Africa’s three capital cities are strategically placed throughout the country and each of these cities host a separate segment of the country’s government.\n\nPretoria – the administrative capital.\n\nThe executive branch of the South African government is housed in Pretoria, this includes the office of the President and the Cabinet. A number of government departments as well as foreign embassies are in Pretoria. Pretoria is in the Northeast of South Africa, in the province of Gauteng and strategically close to the largest city in South Africa, Johannesburg. Johannesburg is the chief business and financial centre of the country.\n\nCape Town- the legislative capital.\n\nCape Town is the second largest city in South Africa and is home to the country’s legislative parliament, including the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces.\n\nBloemfontein -the judicial capital.\n\nBloemfontein is home to the Supreme Court of Appeal, the second-highest court in South Africa. However, the Constitutional Court (the highest court) is located in Johannesburg. Bloemfontein is located in the centre of South Africa in the Free State Province.\n\nSouth Africa is further divided into nine provinces each with its own capital city.\n\nGauteng: Johannesburg\n\nWestern Cape: Cape Town\n\nEastern Cape: Bhisho\n\nFree State: Bloemfontein\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: Pietermaritzburg\n\nLimpopo – Polokwane\n\nMpumalanga: Nelspruit\n\nNorthern Cape: Kimberley\n\nNorth West: Mahikeng (formerly Mafeking)\n\nSouth Africa draws millions of tourists every year with the most popular places being Cape Town, with it’s attractions such as Table Mountain and The Cape Winelands,\n\nand The Kruger National Park one of the largest national parks in the world, where nearly 2 million hectares of unrivaled diversity of life forms fuses with historical and archaeological sights thus providing a wildlife experience that competes with the best in the world.\n\nAll nine provinces of South Africa receive visitors year round and we will be exploring every nook and cranny of this awesome country on our website in due course.\n\nReady to visit South Africa? – Start here..\n\nSharing is caring!"
