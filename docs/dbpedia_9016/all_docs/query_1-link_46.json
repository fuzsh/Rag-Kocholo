        "text": "The City of Pretoria, Gauteng\n\nKnown as the Jacaranda City for all the purple blossom-bedecked trees, which line its thoroughfares, Pretoria is a lovely, quiet city. It has a long, involved and fascinating history. Here you will find significant old buildings and fascinating museums. The Transvaal Museum has natural history displays and is the home of Mrs Ples, the australopithecine fossil found at Sterkfontein in the Cradle of Humankind.\n\nDid you know? Once you've booked your hotel or Pretoria accommodation, explore the suburb and destination pages below for info on attractions, activities and things to do when you visit the City of Pretoria.\n\nAlso worth visiting are the Cultural History Museum and Smuts Museum in Irene, outside Pretoria.\n\nSedate, leafy Pretoria tends to endure a Cinderella complex when compared with the neighbouring city of Johannesburg. When it comes to world class cities, Johannesburg is one of the most happening cities on the African continent and the city gleams with the glamour of money.\n\nPretoria has been left to shrug off its former association with the apartheid government in a relative state of slumber, lying as it does in a warm, sheltered valley surrounded by the hills of the Magaliesberg range that ensure that temperatures here are invariably a few degrees warmer than Johannesburg.\n\nDid you know? Pretoria showcases our culture and history with many monuments and museums, giving visitors a special insight into what has shaped South Africa and her people.\n\nBut dont let the sleepy nature of the pretty city lull you into a false perception. Pretoria has a beauty all of its own, and the slow pace of life is regarded as a bonus by its residents. Many Joburgers seek a quieter existence in Pretoria, prepared to commute daily rather live in the comparative rat race. Wall flower the city is not. When in full bloom in October, Pretoria literally comes alive with blossoms and leaves no one in doubt as to the origin of its nickname - Jacaranda city.\n\nPretoria functions as one of three capitals of South Africa with a population that exceeds a million people, the bulk of whom are government officials. The city centre is laid out in typical city fashion on a grid with wide roads, making getting around fairly simple.\n\nPretorias potential name change to Tshwane (the city lies in the greater Metropolitan municipality of Tshwane) was approved by the names council in 2005 but still lacks endorsement by the Minister of Arts And Culture, remaining under consideration, which may or may not have something to do with the hue and cry that ensued at the onset of the name change.\n\nPractically mandatory when visiting the city are the Pretoria Botanical Gardens, the Zoo, the Union Buildings and various museums and galleries that include Melrose House, the Pioneer Museum, Sammy Marks museum, and the Voortrekker Monument. Outdoor activities include the Wonderboom and Groenkloof Nature Reserves, the Austin Roberts Bird Sanctuary, and a steam train ride around Pretoria.\n\nFind accommodation in Pretoria\n\nSouth Africa Accommodation / Gauteng Accommodation / Northern Gauteng Accommodation / Pretoria Accommodation\n\nDestinations in the Pretoria Region"
