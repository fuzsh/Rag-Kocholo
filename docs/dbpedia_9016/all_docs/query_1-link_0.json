        "text": "Pretoria, city in Gauteng province and administrative capital of the Republic of South Africa. Pretoria stretches along both sides of the Apies River and extends into the western foothills of the Magaliesberg on the east. Founded in 1855 by Marthinus, son of Andries Pretorius, the Boer statesman for whom the city was named, it became the capital of the Transvaal in 1860, administrative capital of South Africa in 1910, and a city in 1931. During the South African War (1899–1902), Winston Churchill was imprisoned there (1899) until his escape. The Peace of Vereeniging, ending the war, was signed at Melrose House on May 31, 1902.\n\nPretoria is well-planned and famous for its streets lined with jacaranda trees. Church Street stretches east-west for 12 miles (20 km). The post-World War II boom is evidenced by skyscrapers around Church Square. Landmarks commemorate Boer history (notably the Voortrekker Monument and the Paul Kruger and Louis Botha statues). Cultural attractions include the Kruger Museum, the National Cultural History Museum, and an art museum.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWorld Cities\n\nPretoria is adorned with large parks, notably the terraced gardens of the Union Buildings, the sunken gardens of Venning Park, municipal nature reserves, and the National Zoological Gardens. It has Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals and is the seat of the universities of Pretoria (founded 1908, university 1930) and South Africa (founded 1873, correspondence school 1946) and technical and teacher-training colleges. At the city’s outskirts are the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the country’s largest research organization."
