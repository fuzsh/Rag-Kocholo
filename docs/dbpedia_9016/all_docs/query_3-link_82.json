Located in the northern part of the Gauteng province, Pretoria functions as one of three capitals of South Africa. Conveniently situated outside of Johannesburg, your Pretoria East property choice will be away from the fast-paced city lifestyle – this is a worthwhile investment.\n\nThe leafy streets and well-established gardens give the area a sedate, village-like feel. Everything is close-by and residents don't have to go far for shopping or recreation. It's a popular suburb, largely because of easy accessibility from major highways - the N1 and the N4. This neighbourhood attracts a good mixture of young professionals and young families, with child-friendly activities widely available. There are large, open spaces in this area, allowing for big gardens and freestanding houses. However, this area also offers a wide variety of townhouses, clusters and security estates.\n\nEducation\n\nPretoria is one of South Africa's leading academic cities, and it is home to the largest residential university in the country, namely the University of Pretoria, as well as UNISA - South Africa’s leading long-distance institution for tertiary education. Various primary and secondary schools for all language groups are widely spread across most residential suburbs. This dynamic infrastructure also enables numerous first-class entertainment facilities, such as the State Theatre, several shopping centers, gourmet restaurants, and sport stadiums which host both local and international sporting events. This has provided the ideal social backdrop for our diverse city. Everyday amenities are conveniently located within walking or driving distances, and hospitals such as Pretoria East, Die Wilgers, Faerie Glen Hospital and various other medical practitioners are located near most residential areas.\n\nResidential overview and portfolio\n\nPretoria East properties offer a large diversity of homes. Some of these properties were built early last century and development continued, resulting in a wide selection of new, old and in-between houses that have been restored and renovated. New ultramodern properties are also being built on sites that have been demolished or sub-divided.\n\nOur residential portfolio extends to numerous exclusive residential estates such as Woodhill, Silver Lakes, Woodlands, Waterkloof Boulevard, etc. Most of these estates offer their own golf courses and schools. Popular student areas include Hatfield and surrounding areas. In Soshanguve, first-time buyers have the opportunity to purchase affordable Pretoria East property directly from the developer.\n\nReasons to invest in property in Pretoria East\n\n(Source credit: Property24)\n\nWith a high concentration of new developments in Pretoria East, demand for properties in the area has skyrocketed in recent years.\n\nMajor new developments such as the R2.5 billion redevelopment of Menlyn Mall and the Hazeldean Development, a R44 billion city development dubbed “The East Capital”, has seen the emergence of a new middle to upper class community in the area.\n\nYoung professionals, young families and students all want to be near the new ‘hip and happening’ East of Pretoria. The area has recently been compared to Sandton in terms of its sophistication, world-class entertainment, upmarket boutiques and gourmet restaurants. Pretoria East is fast outpacing Sandton as Gauteng’s most sought-after area for property investment. A demand for sectional title units in the area has risen significantly over the recent years with developers buying up large properties in the ‘Old East’, demolishing them and erecting apartment complexes.\n\nThe Hatfield, Hillcrest, Brooklyn and Groenkloof areas are particularly attractive as they are all situated close to the University of Pretoria, with major development in student accommodation happening in the area in recent years.\n\nThis has seen the purchase of investment properties soar as investors let these properties out to the bustling student population in the area.\n\nFor buyers looking for their perfect home, the far east suburbs of Hazeldean, Menlyn, Silver Lakes and Lombardy have seen major growth with new access routes being opened as well as schools, medical facilities, shopping and entertainment hubs, tourism buildings and office parks being developed in recent years.\n\nThe area offers 12 different estates, which offer potential buyers everything from bachelor units to apartments, townhouses and even freestanding homes. Pretoria East has become one of the most valuable pockets in Gauteng and we expect this trend to continue with buyers and investors alike drawn to its high-end, central and convenient lifestyle offering."
