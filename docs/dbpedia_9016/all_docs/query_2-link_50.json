        "text": "TThe transformation of Sandton from a smallholding community to a fully-fledged municipality within greater Johannesburg progressed rapidly when construction work began on the Sandton City shopping centre in the 1970s.\n\nIn 2000, when the South African stock exchange changed its name to the JSE Securities Exchange, and relocated to Sandton, after 113 years in central Johannesburg, Sandton’s reputation as Joburg’s new capital of wealth and style was truly established.\n\nSandton Drive, Katherine Street into Wierda Road East, West Street, Rivonia Road, and Grayston Drive, form the boundary of the Sandton CBD; and beyond it, the prosperous, residential suburbs of Sandown, Parkmore, Benmore Gardens, Wierda Valley, Sandhurst, Inanda, Chishlehurston and Atholl are Johannesburg’s equivalent of Beverly Hills. East, on Sandton’s doorstep by contrast, is the huge, informal, and mostly poor township of Alexandra.\n\nAbout 20 hotels in the Sandton CBD offer top-notch accommodation, many of them 5-star. The Sandton International Conference Centre, numerous hotel conference venues, and convenient access to banks, internet services, medical facilities, and transport, make Sandton the centre of Johannesburg’s business tourism industry. A number of embassies and consulates are based in, and around, the Sandton CBD.\n\nShopping is a favourite occupation for Johannesburg’s fashionistas, who flock to Nelson Mandela Square to buy high-end international lifestyle brands, jewellery, art, antiques, and African couture.\n\nSandton City, one of the largest shopping malls in the Southern Hemisphere, is the grand dame of retail therapy in Sandton, with over 300 stores.\n\nThe Marc opened recently in Sandton. The development consists of two office towers, shops and restaurants, ample parking, a hotel and a public art installation.\n\nNext door, on Nelson Mandela Square, a 6m bronze statue of Nelson Mandela watches over Sandton’s most fashionable meeting place. Sporting a fountain, notable steakhouses, a library and a theatre, the outdoor piazza is Jo'burg's answer to St Mark's in Venice.\n\nAfter dark, Sandton’s moguls shed their jackets and ties, and join Johannesburg’s poshest party animals in Sandton’s upmarket restaurants, bars, coffee shops, clubs, and late-night entertainment venues. At weekends, a European-style street culture of organised buskers, street performers, and outdoor art exhibitions prevails.\n\nInnesfree Park and Mushroom Farm Park are green spaces within walking distance of the CBD, and are ideal places to jog, picnic, or watch the sun sink below Sandton’s iconic skyline."
