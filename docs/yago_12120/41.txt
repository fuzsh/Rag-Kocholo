*"Marguerite Snow (September 9, 1889 â€“ February 17, 1958) was an American silent film and stage actress. In her early films she was billed as Margaret Snow.

Snow became an actress at an early age and played many parts while still a child. Her stage career did not begin in earnest until she was sixteen years old. Her first engagement was with James O'Neill in a revival of The Count of Monte Cristo, at the Crawford Theatre in Wichita, Kansas, on February 11, 1907. She played in The College Widow, Mrs. Temple's Telegram, as Elsa in The Devil, and at the Bijou Theater, Wheeling, where as leading lady of the stock company she played ten different parts. On Broadway, she performed in The Devil (1908) and The Other Fellow (1910).

Beginning in 1911, Snow gained prominence in silent films made by the Kinemacolor Company, the Thanhouser Film Company in New Rochelle, New York, and the old Metro Pictures studio before it became MGM. In 1911 she starred in films such as The Moth and The Buddhist Priestess. Some of her later feature pictures are Baseball and Bloomers (1911), A Niagara Honeymoon (1912), The Caged Bird (1913), The Silent Voice (1915), A Corner in Cotton (1916), Broadway Jones (1917), The Veiled Woman (1922), and Kit Carson Over The Great Divide (1925). In Broadway Jones Snow played a pretty stenographer at the Jones' gun factory as the movie's leading lady. This was the first Artcraft photoplay of George M. Cohan. She never made a movie after the introduction of sound to films.

Snow was married twice. Her first wedding was in January 1913 to Jens Bosen, a director, whose professional name was James Cruze. He was affiliated with Famous Players-Lasky and was one of the best-known directors in motion pictures. In 1957 Snow underwent a kidney operation. Complications occurred, and she died, aged 68, at the Motion Picture Country Home on February 17, 1958, in Los Angeles, California."
