        "meta_description": "In Loving Memory of Marguerite Elizabeth Petras (Aka Bonnie, Oma, Buns, Bunny, Bunisha, Butt)\nMarguerite Elizabeth Petras, affectionately known as Bonnie, left an indelible mark on the lives of all who had the privilege of knowing her. With unwavering love and devotion, she embraced her roles as a devoted wife, mother, grandmother and principal, touching countless hearts with her warmth and compassion. Bonnie’s love for dancing, laughter, and dedication to education enriched the lives of those around her.\nBorn in Queens and raised in a nurturing home, Bonnie’s journey led her to build a beautiful life with her husband Chris in the Georgia mountains, where she found joy in every moment. As a family, they treasured adventures together, from travel escapades to countless days of tennis matches and laughter-filled gatherings.\nBonnie’s magnetic spirit, genuine care for others, and infectious laughter created a wide circle of friends, including her cherished companion, Russell. Together, they cherished the simple joys of life, exploring new horizons and relishing each other’s company.\nShe is survived by her loving husband, Russ, her sons Ross and Joey and her daughters-in-law Kristen and Kristen. Bonnie was a doting grandmother to her eight adored grandchildren – Halen, Brayden, Kiley, Easton, Hudson, Christopher, Landen, and Nolan – who brought immense joy to her heart.\nBonnie’s legacy of love, courage, and zest for life will forever be cherished by her family and friends. As we bid farewell to this remarkable soul, may her memory continue to inspire us to live life to the fullest, to cherish every moment, and to spread love and kindness wherever we go. May she rest in eternal peace.",
