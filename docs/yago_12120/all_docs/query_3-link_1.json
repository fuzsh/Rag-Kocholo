        "text": "Although Marguerite Snow was born in Salt Lake City, her father--a comedian in vaudeville minstrel shows--traveled extensively, so she grew up all over the country. When her father died, she and her mother settled in Denver, Colorado. Marguerite took drama lessons with the intentions of becoming a stage actress, and made her stage debut in 1906. She was soon playing on Broadway, and after that joined a touring stock company. Her entry into films was somewhat accidental. One day in 1911 a girlfriend was playing in a film being made by the Thanhouser Co., and Marguerite went along to satisfy her curiosity as to how films were made. The studio head saw her and convinced her to appear in the film also. She found that she enjoyed film work, and soon quit the stage to concentrate on films exclusively. After appearing in scores of two-reelers for Thanhouser and Kinemacolor, among other companies, she married actor (later director) James Cruze in 1913. In 1915 she journeyed to Hollywood, and appeared in many productions for Metro, both full-length features and serials. She and Cruze divorced in 1923. Two years later she married comedian Neely Edwards, and retired from the business."
