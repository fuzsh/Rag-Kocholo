As Elsie grows to womanhood, Joe leaves the army and becomes a successful miner, falling in love with her over the years. His jealousy over the attentions of Bob Stanton, a handsome stranger, angers Elsie though, and she plans to elope with Stanton. When war with Spain is declared, Joe abandons his quest for Elsie and reenlists in the army. Meanwhile, she discovers that Stanton is a womanizer and realizes her love for Joe. Disguised as a soldier and aided by war correspondent Willie Live, Elsie travels to the Philippines, where an officer assigns his \"recruit\" the task of delivering an important message to Joe's company. Elsie penetrates the enemy lines and saves Joe and his men who then complete their heroic fight.\n\nThe Dancer and the King - Writer\n\n1915\n\nCora - Actor, Director\n\nReleased May 9, 1915\n\nCast\n\nEdwin Carewe – George Garnier\n\nEmily Stevens – Cora\n\nFrank Elliot\n\nEthel Stewart\n\nMarse Covington - Director\n\nReleased July 12, 1015\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nCast\n\nEdward Connelly – Capt.

Cooper Cliffe), the wealthy Strong (Percy Standing), and Campbell, a poor but up-and-coming district attorney (Mahlon Hamilton). Campbell marries her, and while Strong remains her friend, Ross angrily decides to get revenge on his rival. He sends Campbell a letter which contains a deadly poison. Strong, however, opens it up at Campbell's innocent request and he becomes the victim instead. Because of circumstantial evidence -- Campbell was known to be jealous of his wife's friendship with Strong -- the DA is tried and convicted of the crime. But his wife knows something is fishy, and through her investigation, Ross is discovered to be the murderer.\n\nThe House of Tears - Director\n\nReleased December 13, 1015\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Frank Mitchell Dazey, June Mathis\n\nCast\n\nEmily Stevens – Mrs. Alice Collingwood\n\nHenri Bergman – Robert Collingwood\n\nWalter Hitchcock – Henry Thorne\n\nGeorge Brennan – John\n\nMadge Tyrone – Nurse\n\nBernard Randall\n\n1916\n\nThe Snowbird - Actor, Director\n\nReleased May 1, 1916\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriter – Mary Rider\n\nCast\n\nMabel Taliaferro – Lois Wheeler\n\nEdwin Carewe – Jean Corteau\n\nJames Cruze – Bruce Mitchell\n\nWarren Cook – John Wheeler\n\nArthur Evars – Pierre\n\nWalter Hitchcock – Michael Flynn\n\nKitty Stevens – Zoe\n\nJohn Melody – Magistrate Le Blanc\n\nJohn Wheeler (Warren Cook) gets himself in some financial hot water and needs to prove that he is half owner of some land in Canada. But the only person with a copy of the deed is Jean Corteau (Edwin Carewe, who also directed), and Corteau has gone up to the property and decided to claim all of it for himself. In lieu of the money owed him, Bruce Mitchell (James Cruze) tells Wheeler that he will accept the hand of his daughter Lois (Mabel Taliaferro) in marriage. Lois can't stand Mitchell, so she disguises herself as a boy and makes her way to Corteau. Corteau eventually wises up to the fact that Lois is a girl, and Lois explains her dilemma. At this juncture, Wheeler and Mitchell, who have been searching for Lois, arrive at Corteau's cabin. There is a fierce battle in which Mitchell stabs Corteau and Corteau mortally wounds Mitchell. Corteau recovers from his injuries and marries Lois, with whom he has fallen in love. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\nThe Upstart - Director\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Tom Barry, June Mathis\n\nCast\n\nJames Lackaye – Judge Mitchell\n\nGeorge Le Guere – Coventry Petmore\n\nFred Sittenham – Larry Price\n\nMarguerite Snow – Beatrice Mitchell\n\nFrederic Sumner – Rev.

She pours her heart out to her three friends, Larry (Richard Barbee), Henry (George Fauncefort), and Tony (William Cahill). Larry, after looking over her rejected manuscripts, suggests that she write something with a new twist. But their little party breaks up over an argument, and Alice is alone when Larry's friend, Tom Leighton (Henry Mortimer) arrives. Alice is in such a deep depression that she is about to commit suicide, but Leighton convinces her to make a deal with him. If she will hold off for a year, he will take out a policy on her life for $50,000. Out of that he will loan her $30,000 (quite a sum in those days), and when she kills herself in a year, he will collect on the policy, thus getting the original $30,000 back, plus $20,000 in interest. She agrees and has a great year, enjoying all sorts of luxuries and falling in love with Leighton. Unfortunately, Leighton is already engaged to someone else (Jeanette Horton), so by the end of the year, Alice is miserable again and ready to kill herself. It turns out that Leighton's fiancée is willing to break off the engagement, but when he rushes to Alice, he discovers that he is too late. Then the picture cuts back to the original New Year's Eve -- the whole film was just the \"new twist\" that Alice had put in one of her stories.\n\nGod's Half Acre - Director\n\nReleased August 1, 1916\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Shannon Fife, June Mathis\n\nCast\n\nMabel Taliaferro – Blossom\n\nJack W.

Cohill – Pastamoo\n\nWhen postman Francois Breault (Fred Jones) is murdered, the Northwest Mounted Police send Corporal Blake (Percy G. Standing) to apprehend the killer. Circumstantial evidence points to Jan Thoreau (Thomas Holding) as the guilty party, but when Blake arrives at Thoreau's cabin, he isn't home. His wife, Marie (Jane Grey), however, is there. Blake pretends to be a friend of Thoreau's and she admits that yes, her husband and Breault had a disagreement and that he was away from home for a period of time. Blake, convinced that he has an open-and-shut case, tells Marie that he will let Thoreau get away if she give in to his lecherous demands. After a struggle, she is ready to give in, but then Thoreau arrives home. Blake arrests him, but Marie helps him to escape. Blake gives chase, but back at the post, the half-breed Pastamoo (William A. Cohill) confesses to the murder. The officers dash to the Thoreau cabin, and Blake starts a gunfight in which he winds up dead. With that, the Thoreaus are able to go back to their lives. This picture was adapted from the play The Fiddling Man by James Oliver Curwood. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\nThe Greatest Power - Director\n\nReleased June 18, 1917\n\nDirector’s – Edwin Carewe, Edward LeSaint\n\nWriters – Albert S.

The Scottish-born singer played Dolores Fargis, who loses her husband (Hamilton Revelle) when her sordid past is revealed. Years later, the couple is reunited in, of all places, war-torn Germany, where he is a captured soldier, and she is a Red Cross nurse. Reformed and repentant, Dolores saves the life of her former husband before bravely facing a firing squad. Deprived of her famous vocal chords, Garden was not much of an actress, and she quickly returned to the Metropolitan and other opera venues.\n\nThe Trail to Yesterday - Director\n\nReleased May 6, 1918\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – June Mathis, Charles Alden Seltzer\n\nCast\n\nBert Lytell – New ‘Dakota’ Keegles\n\nAnna Q.

Having been forced to leave his Eastern home in disgrace, cowboy Lytell is in no mood to entertain visitors, and when heroine Anna Q. Nilsson takes refuge in his cabin during a storm, he is all for throwing her out. He changes his mind when he discovers that the girl's father (Ernest Maupin was the man responsible for ruining his life. Vengefully, Lytell forces the girl to marry him, but she escapes his clutches -- only to return to him when she learns that her father isn't her father, and that Lytell has been dealt a dishonest hand. The film's plot was actually a bit more complicated than this, but basically The Trail to Yesterday is a story of regeneration, of the sort that Bert Lytell always did so well. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nThe House of Gold - Director\n\nReleased June 17, 1918\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Katherine Kavanaugh, June Mathis\n\nCast\n\nEmmy Wehlen – Pamela Martin\n\nJoseph Kilgour – Douglas Martin\n\nHugh Thompson – Frank Steele\n\nHelen Lindroth – Mrs. Stanley Cartwright\n\nMaude Hill – Mrs. Alicia Temple\n\n<Scenario>\n\nAgainst her mother's wishes, Pamela Martin (Emmy Wehlan) becomes engaged to struggling lawyer Frank Steele (Hugh Thompson). Working in concert with Pamela's mom, the girl's oily ex-suitor Gilbert Martin (Joseph Kilgour) frames Steele on a robbery charge, promising not to prosecute if Pamela will agree to marry Martin. It so happens that Gilbert Martin has a twin brother named Douglas (also played by Joseph Kilgour), who has wrongly been committed to an insane asylum so that Gilbert can lay claim to the family fortune. Douglas escapes from the asylum and catches up with Gilbert, and in the ensuing struggle Douglas is killed. Facing charges for a previous crime, Gilbert hastily changes clothes with Douglas and escapes. The police arrive, find the body of \"Gilbert,\" and accuse Pamela of murder. She is acquitted thanks to the legal know-how of Frank Steele, whom she marries after the trial. Meanwhile, Gilbert returns, intending to drive Pamela insane by posing as a ghost. Gilbert's motivation for his actions are somewhat hazy, but the end result is most satisfying: Trapped by Pamela's new husband, Gilbert pays for his sins in a spectacular fall from a third-story window. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nPals First - Director\n\nReleased October 1918\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Francis Perry Elliott, Lee Wilson Dodd\n\nCast\n\nHarold Lockwood – Danny Rowland\n\nRubye De Remer – Jean Logan\n\nJames Lackaye – Dominie\n\nFrank DeVernon – Judge Logan\n\nRichard Neill – Dr. Harry Chilton\n\nAnthony Byrd – Uncle Alex\n\nPauline Dempsey – Aunt Caroline\n\nWalter P.

The star has the part of Danny Rowland, a tramp, afterwards known as Dick Castelman, a wealthy young man. His \"pal,\" Dominie, shares good and bad days alike with him, and the two have a strange series of adventures. Love, and fortune, are showered upon \"Dick,\" to Dominie's great mystification, and the threads of the story become more and more entangled. The finish of the play contains a real surprise, as well as complete satisfaction for everyone. \"Pals First\" will prove a real delight.\n\nLiberty Bond Jimmy - Director\n\nReleased October 1, 1918\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriter – Finis Fox\n\nCast\n\nHarold Lockwood – Jimmy\n\nFrank Currier\n\nLouis Stern\n\n<Scenario>\n\nJimmy, a millionaire's son, discovers the family butler is really a German spy.\n\n1919\n\nThe Great Romance - Director\n\nReleased January 19, 1919\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe, Henry Otto\n\nCast\n\nHarold Lockwood – Rupert Danza\n\nRubye De Remer – Althea Hanway\n\nJoseph Granby – Prince Boris\n\nFrank Currier – King Rudolph\n\nHelen Lindroth – Olga Marie\n\nFranklyn Hanna – John P.

Walter Byfield\n\nBigelow Cooper – Sir John Rizzio\n\nLeslie T. Peacocke – Chief of Scotland Yard\n\n<Scenario>\n\nSince he did not survive into the 1920s -- the golden era for silent movies -- few people today realize that Harold Lockwood was an extremely popular matinee idol. At the time of his death from influenza in 1918, he had several films in the can, which were released in the first few months of 1919. Judging from the plot alone, it's obvious that this melodrama was made before the end of World War I. Cyril Hammersley (Lockwood) is an Englishman engaged to an American girl, Doris Mathers (Naomi Childers). Doris does not understand why Hammersley isn't fighting for his country, and he can't explain that it's because he's a member of the secret service. Hammersley's jealous rival for Doris is Sir John Rizzio (Bigelow Cooper), who is also part of a German spy network. Rizzio tries to convince Doris that Hammersley is the one who's a tool of the Germans. Hammersley then gets his hands on a pack of cigarette papers bearing a secret code -- a message containing a plan to blow up London. The papers were meant for Rizzio, and he locks Hammersley away. Hammersley, however, has already given the papers to Doris, and Rizzio takes them from her by force. Doris calls on Scotland Yard for help and they retrieve the evil plans. Hammersley is freed and is reunited with Doris.\n\nWay of the Strong - Director\n\nReleased 1919\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriter – June Mathis\n\nCast\n\nAnna Q.

Promised in marriage to wealthy Lot Gordon (Joe King), Scottish lassie Madelon MacTavish (Dana) prefers Lot's poor relation Burr Gordon (Wheeler Oakman). The wisdom of her choice is proven later on, when a vengeful Lot tries to rape the girl. She stabs the bounder, whereupon Burr gallantly takes the blame. When Lot recovers, Madelon fesses up and agrees to marry him if he won't prosecute Burr.

Jimmy then wins a $25,000 bet that he can keep from being arrested more than once in the coming year by getting a twelve-month jail sentence for fighting in a bar and then sassing the judge. He is released early, however, due to his father's efforts and vows to succeed on his own. He gets stranded in a small town where he falls in love with Ethel Wheeler, the owner of a rundown hotel, and with her makes a fortune selling mineral water found on her property. When the town banker tries to foreclose on them, Jimmy opens his own bank with the $25,000, marries Ethel and gains the respect of his father for his success.\n\nThe Right to Lie - Director\n\nReleased November 22, 1919\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nCast\n\nDolores Cassinelli - Carlotta\n\nFrank Mills – Curtis Austin\n\nJoe King – Crosby Dana\n\nWarren Cook – J.

Winthrop Drake (Warren Cook) brings his daughter Carlotta (Dolores Cassinelli) home from Italy, he tells his wife (Grace Reals) he is the girl's guardian because he wants his prior marriage kept a secret. Carlotta marries Curtis Austin (Frank Mills), but a suitor she rejected is bent on ruining her marriage and her reputation. He believes he has proof that she was having an affair with Drake, unaware that he is her father. When Carlotta tries to reason with the blackmailer, Austin believes she is having an affair with him and murders him. Austin is put on trial and to save him, Carlotta lies by saying that she actually did have an affair so that the homicide will be ruled justifiable. She gets him off, and when he finds out the truth -- that she is innocent of any wrongdoing -- they are reunited. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\n1920\n\nThe Web of Deceit - Director, Producer\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nCast\n\nDolores Cassinelli – Wanda Hubbard\n\nLetty Ford – Mrs. Hubbard\n\nFranklyn Hanna – Wealthy Officer\n\n<Scenario>\n\nJust about every silent star in the late '10s and early '20s had to play a dual role in at least one picture, and this is minor luminary Dolores Cassinelli's turn. Wanda Hubbard (Cassinelli) is the lover and partner of a criminal. While they are robbing a safe, they overhear some people discussing a \"long lost daughter.\" Some time later, while Wanda is visiting her mother (Letty Ford) and sister Lucille (Cassinelli again), she discovers that she and Lucille are really cousins, and that Lucille is actually the daughter of the wealthy officer (Franklyn Hanna) of the house she had robbed. Wanda uses this opportunity to pawn herself off to the officer as Lucille so she can benefit from his good life. Eventually her identity is discovered, and Lucille returns to her rightful place in her father's home. Cassinelli did little more to distinguish between characters in this picture other than changing wigs. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\nRio Grande - Director, Writer\n\nReleased April 25, 1920\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Augustus E.

Dean has a fight with the captain and throws him overboard. He and Isobel escape in a lifeboat and go into hiding at an Eskimo village. Mountie William MacVeigh (House Peters) is assigned the task of tracking Dean down. The Eskimo chief, Bye Bye (Horin Konishi), finds out about MacVeigh and warns the Deans. When the Mountie encounters Isobel, she is traveling back to civilization with her husband in a coffin. Taken with Isobel's beauty, MacVeigh does not investigate too deeply, and as a result, she and her husband evade his grasp. Corporal Bucky Smith (Tom Wilson) also goes after the Deans and MacVeigh arrests Scottie. Once they are away from Smith, he lets him go. Back at the station's cabin, he finds a little girl (Pearlie Norton) who reminds him of Isobel. Dean comes to claim the child, but dies of exhaustion. Isobel, mad from brain fever, drives the Mountie away, claiming that he killed Dean to make her his wife.

The two proceed to the home of Ruthven Smith (Thomas Jefferson), a family friend of Annesley, but Ruthven mistakes Nelson for a thief and he shoots Nelson. Annesley's aunt banishes her from the house over her niece's affair with Nelson, but despite her aunts disapproval, the two are soon married. Later, the bride hears Nelson tell an underworld boss he will give up crime after one last heist.

In this drama, she plays a spoiled young girl, something the public may have seen as typecasting (even if it wasn't necessarily true in real life). Irene (Harris) is the daughter of wealthy Richard Fletcher (Emmet C. King). Fletcher doesn't let on that he's having financial trouble, and continues to spend scads of money to make her happy. She has two suitors -- one is John Marshall, a struggling young architect (William Lawrence) and the other is Charles Munson (Walter McGrail), a rich clothing designer (this gave the filmmakers a chance to show off the latest extravagant fashions -- a box office plus in the 1920s). Both young men propose. Before Irene can choose one, she gets in a fierce argument with her father and falls down a flight of stairs. While unconscious, she dreams that Munson offers to bail her father out of his financial bind, providing that he gets Irene to marry him. She has already secretly married Marshall, so Munson takes back his offer, and Fletcher shoots himself. When she comes to, Irene decides to stop being so selfish, and chooses Marshall as her husband.\n\nPlaythings of Destiny - Director\n\nReleased May, 1921\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nProducers – Louis B.

Julie Laneau, a French-Canadian girl (Stewart) weds distinguished Englishman Geoffrey Arnold (Herbert Rawlinson) and soon enough, she is expecting. But then she is told that Arnold is already married to a woman, Claire (Grace Morse). Julie flees from their cabin in the Northwoods into a blizzard, where she is found by Hubert Randolph (Walter McGrail). Randolph takes her in and takes care of her. He offers to marry her and take her with him to Jamaica and she accepts. But their life together is a disappointment -- Randolph gets so wrapped up in his political ambitions that he neglects Julie and her little boy (Richard Headrick). Randolph wants to become governor, and he asks Julie to help him entertain an important guest who will help him achieve this goal. It turns out the man is Arnold, and she refuses. The two meet up anyhow, and it turns out that she was his legal wife after all. After hearing the whole story, Randolph willingly gives Julie back to Arnold. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\nThe Invisible Fear - Director\n\nReleased October 10, 1921\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nProducers – Louis B.

The lusty Arthur Comstock (Walter McGrail) tries to force himself on lovely Sylvia Langdon (Stewart). In an attempt to escape his unwanted advances, Sylvia hurls a candlestick at him, knocking him senseless. She sees his prostrate form through a window and is convinced she has killed him. She marries her fiancé, Bentley Arnold (Allan Forrest), and tries to forget the incident. But she's in for a shock when she and Arnold throw a party at their home and Comstock shows up. Sylvia dashes out of the room in shock and Comstock follows after her. Instead of demanding her body, however, he demands that she give him the family jewels. Comstock, it turns out, murdered his uncle, and it was his body that Sylvia had seen through the window. Comstock's attempts at thievery are foiled and he gets his due. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\nHer Mad Bargain - Director\n\nReleased 1921\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nAsst.

Alice Lambert (Stewart) has had a hard life, full of sadness and disillusionment. One day she finally decides to end it all, but she is discovered by David Leighton (Walter McGrail) before she can go through with it. By calling her a coward and a quitter, Leighton convinces her to rethink what she is about to do and strikes a deal with her: He will give her 50 thousand dollars to stay alive for another year, at the end of which she can kill herself. With her sudden wealth, Alice is able to surround herself in luxury -- and she also learns along the way that money isn't everything. At the end of the year, Alice has come to realize that she actually has quite a lot to live for, and one of her reasons is Leighton. He proposes and she is more than happy to accept.\n\n1922\n\nI am the Law - Director\n\nReleased June 1, 1922\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – James Oliver Curwood, Raymond Schrock\n\nCast\n\nAlice Lake – Joan Cameron\n\nKenneth Harlan – Cpl.

It features an excellent cast, including both Beery brothers, Wallace and Noah. Brothers Tom and Bob Fitzgerald (Kenneth Harlan and Gaston Glass, respectively) are both members of the Northwest Mounted Police. Bob falls in love with schoolteacher Joan Cameron (Alice Lake) when he saves her from an attack by Fu Chang (Wallace Beery). Tom is not so heroic, and he becomes involved with the wife (Rosemary Theby) of post sergeant George Mardeaux (Noah Beery). Tom kills Mardeaux, and Bob is forced to hunt down his own brother. He tracks him down to Joan's cabin. But Bob falls seriously ill, and on what he believes to be his deathbed, he protects his brother by signing a confession that claims he is Mardeaux's murderer. Tom returns to the post with the news, but Bob recovers, and when he comes back he is faced with a lynch mob who believe him to be a murderer. Joan tries to save Bob but is attacked by Mardeaux's two-timing widow. Finally the truth comes out that Tom is the real killer, and he swallows poison to avoid hanging.\n\nA Question of Honor - Director\n\nReleased March, 1922\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nProducers - Louis B.

Bill Shannon (Hearn) is building a dam in the mountains of the West. Leon Morse, a Wall Street millionaire and railroad magnate (Arthur Stewart Hull), wants the same land as a right-of-way for his railroad. He travels West to negotiate with Shannon, bringing along his fiancée, Anne Wilmot (Stewart), and her Aunt Katherine (Adele Farrington). The trip proves to be Morse's undoing in several ways -- Anne immediately falls in love with Shannon, who is not terribly cooperative about handing over the land. After his offer to Shannon is turned down, Morse plants a bomb to blow up the dam. Anne is the one who saves the day by disconnecting the bomb's wire. After losing the battle for both the land and his sweetheart, Morse crawls back to his Eastern home. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\nSilver Wings - Director\n\nReleased May 22, 1922\n\nDirectors – Edwin Carewe, John Ford\n\nWriter – Paul Sloane\n\nCast\n\nMary Carr – Anna Webb\n\nLynn Hammond – John Webb\n\nKnox Kincaid – John\n\nJoseph Monahan – Harry\n\nMybeth Carr – Ruth\n\n<Scenario>\n\nCharacter actor Mary Carr was well known for her maternal roles, especially after the success of 1920's Over the Hill. Here Carr plays Anna Webb, whose husband John (Lynn Hammond) invents a new kind of sewing machine. The patent makes the family wealthy, and after Webb dies, Anna takes over the business. She puts her sons John (Percy Helton) and Harry Joseph Striker) in charge of the factory, while daughter Ruth (Jane Thomas) elopes. When Harry steals some money, the blame falls on John, who leaves town. Harry, who has been spoiled all his life, continues his dishonest ways. He draws money out of the family treasury and forges a check for a huge sum. Rather than see her son go to jail, Anna sells everything to cover the bad check and is reduced to working in a sweatshop. Her children are nowhere to be found. When Anna is injured in a car accident which makes the papers, her children reappear to do right by dear old mom. ~ Janiss Garza,\n\n1923\n\nMighty Lak' a Rose - Director, Presenter\n\nReleased February 12, 1923\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Curtis Benton\n\nCast\n\nJames Rennie – Jimmy Harrison\n\nSam Hardy – Jerome Trevor\n\nAnders Randolf – ‘Bull’ Morgan\n\nHarry Short – ‘Slippery Eddie” Foster\n\nDorothy Mackall – Rose Duncan\n\nHelen Montrose – ‘Hard-Boiled’ Molly Malone\n\nPaul Panzer – Humpty Logan\n\nDora Mills Adams – Mrs. Trevor\n\n<Scenario>\n\nJust because movies before the late '20s were filmed without sound recording, it doesn't mean they were truly silent. This \"heart interest\" drama (an important release for First National in 1923) is a case in point -- Curtis Benton wrote the original story, inspired by the 1901 hit song \"Mighty Lak' a Rose,\" and the tune certainly played an important part of the live score when the picture hit the theaters. Instead of the lively flappers for which she would become famous, Dorothy Mackaill plays a blind orphan, Rose Duncan, who has a special talent with the violin. Jerome Trevor, a famed pianist (Sam Hardy), hears her playing and sends her to an uncle in New York so she can become educated. But the uncle is killed in an accident on his way to meet her and she is taken in by gang leader Bull Morgan (Anders Randolph). Morgan pretends to be her uncle to elude the police, and he sees the value of keeping her around as cover. One of the crooks working under Morgan, Jimmie Harrison (James Rennie), falls in love with Rose and her beautiful music and he balks at using her to pull off a job. After a heated argument in which Rose is accidentally injured, Morgan comes under the girl's positive influence, as do the other gang members. They all decide to go straight -- even Morgan's hardened moll, Molly (Helen Montrose) -- but when they find out that Rose's blindness can be cured, they decide to pull off one last heist. Jimmie is caught and goes to prison. Trevor finally finds Rose and sends her to be trained. She is about to make her debut -- and to promise herself to Trevor -- when Jimmie shows up. Rose, who thought he was dead, is happily reunited with him. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\nThe Girl of the Golden West - Director, Presenter\n\nReleased May 3, 1923\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – David Belasco, Adelaide Heilbron\n\nCast\n\nSylvia Breamer – The Girl\n\nJ. Warren Kerrigan – Ramerrez\n\nRussell Simpson – Jack Rance\n\nRosemary Theby – Nina Micheltorena\n\n<Scenario>\n\nA now forgotten star of the later silent era, Sylvia Breamer took on the old David Belasco stage chestnut in this remake of Cecil B. DeMille's 1915 Western classic. Miss Breamer plays a saloon owner who becomes a pawn between two men, a swashbuckling bandit (played in his usual florid style by J. Warren Kerrigan of The Covered Wagon fame) and a tough lawman (Russell Simpson). The center-piece of the story is, of course, the climactic poker game, in which the stakes are the bandit's life and the girl's virtue. According to contemporary reviews, Sylvia Breamer was sorely miscast as the tough, yet feminine saloon boss and that the film was no improvement over the DeMille original.\n\nThe Bad Man - Director\n\nReleased October 8, 1923\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriter – Porter Emerson Browne\n\nCast\n\nHolbrook Blinn – Pancho Lopez\n\nJack Mulhill – Gilbert Jones\n\nWalter McGrail – Morgan Pell\n\nEnid Bennett – Mrs. Morgan Pell\n\nHarry Myers – Red Giddings\n\nCharles A.

Blake\n\nFrank Lanning – Indian Cook\n\nPeter Vanzuelle – Pedro\n\n<Scenario>\n\nThe titular character, a Mexican outlaw named Pancho Lopez, bore an undisguised resemblance, both in name and personality, to Pancho Villa, a pre-eminent Mexican Revolutionary general, who was much in the news before and during the play's run and whose assassination on July 20, two-and-a-half months before the film's release, appeared in all the headlines. The plotline has Lopez (Holbrook Blinn) and his band of outlaws living from the proceeds gained as a result of theft and confiscation, which means property belonging to anyone wealthy enough to possess anything of value. One of those is rancher Gilbert Jones (Jack Mulhall), whose cattle losses are pushing him to the edge of bankruptcy.\n\nAs Lopez is about to deprive Jones of the remainder of his cattle as well as of any valuables he may still possess, and even to kidnap his beloved former sweetheart (Enid Bennett), now married to heartless loan shark Morgan Pell (Walter McGrail), he recognizes Jones as the man who, years earlier, saved his life. Determined to show his gratitude, the powerful bandit robs the rapacious bank which, in cahoots with Pell, cheats and exploits the locals, and gives the money to Jones. When Pell arrives to foreclose on Jones' oil-rich ranch, Lopez, addressing him as \"Mr. Loan-Fish\", inquires of him whether women in his country inherit their late husbands' wealth, and then, since he considers the despicable corrupter to be an unworthy opponent, tells his top aide to shoot him (intertitle: \"Pedro, I do not hunt rabbits—you keel heem\"), thus freeing his widow to marry Jones. Finally, he returns all of Jones' stolen cattle and bids the happy couple farewell, thanking them for making him feel good.\n\n1924\n\nA Son of the Sahara - Director, Producer, Presenter\n\nReleased April 13, 1924\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nAssistant Director – Wallace Fox\n\nWriter – Adelaide Heilbron\n\nCast\n\nBert Lytell – Raoul Le Breton\n\nClaire Windsor – Barbara Barbier\n\nWalter McGrail – Capt.

When Cassim's father is killed during an attack on a French fort, the boy (George Chebat) swears vengeance on Colonel Barbier (Montagu Love). He grows up to become known as Pierre Lamont (played by Bert Lytell) a polished young man with European manners. He falls in love with Barbara (Claire Windsor) who rejects him when she learns he is an Arab. Cassim discovers that Barbara is Barbier's daughter, so he carries out his oath by kidnapping the two of them, and their friend, Captain Duval (Walter McGrail). He sells Barbara as a slave, but then bids on her himself. When she refuses to marry him, he swears he will take her anyway. Duval escapes and fetches the French troops while Cassim finally admits that he loves Barbara too much to harm her. In the ensuing battle, Duval is mortally wounded, but before he dies, he hands Barbara a letter from Cassim's mother, explaining that he is not an Arab at all -- both of his parents were French. Cassim is pardoned, and he and Barbara are united. ~ Janiss Garza, Rovi\n\nMadonna of the Streets - Director, Producer, Presenter\n\nReleased October 19, 1924\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Frank Griffin, Fanny Hatton\n\nCast\n\nAlla Nazimova – Mary Carlson\n\nMilton Sills – Reverend John Morton\n\nClaude Gillingwater – Lord Patrington\n\nCourtenay Foote – Dr. Colbeck\n\nWallace Beery – Bill Smythe\n\nAnders Randolf – ‘Bull’ Morgan\n\n<Scenario>\n\nAlla Nazimova had been away from the screen for over a year when she made this drama, and she was paid well under half her former salary. To add box-office value, she was given Milton Sills as a co-star, but even so, the film did not do well either in film receipts or reviews. Reverend John Morton (Sills) is the minister at a fashionable parish, but when his uncle wills him a small fortune, he quits to open up a mission in London's Limehouse district. The uncle's mistress, Mary Carlson (Nazimova), is furious that she was cut out of the will and is determined to get the money any way she can. She finds Morton and vamps him into marrying her, though much to her chagrin, she discovers that he's intent on spending his wealth on the poor. Morton eventually discovers that Mary was his uncle's mistress, so when she runs off he doesn't go after her. Mary's life goes downhill and she takes to the streets. Morton, meanwhile, is attacked by a mob and decides that he is better without his inheritance. He holds onto his ministry, however, and Mary returns to him when she decides to repent.

Pierpont goes after Fay and when he discovers she has wed, takes a trip with the Mortimer’s over the desert. Dr. Mortimer is suspicious of the relationship between his wife and the newcomer, and when Pierpont is bitten by a viper, he refuses to treat him if there is a relationship going on. Fay lies so that Mortimer will take care of the wound. Later, she confesses the truth and sends Pierpont away. Eventually Mortimer is killed by an Arab attack, and when Fay runs into Pierpont, he reveals that Fifi was at his apartment that long-ago day to exact revenge. Now that nothing at all stands in their way, the pair reunite.

This one is a melodrama of the sea in which she plays Molla Hansen, the daughter of the captain of an oil schooner (Bert Sprotte). Molla has made plans to marry Captain Rodney O'Malley (Robert Frazer) when she returns from a voyage with her father, but the ship burns at sea. She is saved by a lighthouse keeper who dies from his wounds, and in gratitude, she cares for the man's daughter, Pearl (Dorothy Sebastian). O'Malley, believing Molla to be dead, goes on a two-year voyage. Charley Watts (Alan Roscoe), a rum-runner, seduces Pearl, who tries to blame her pregnancy on an innocent man. Then she learns that Watts is married, and she turns on the gas in the lighthouse, hoping that the explosion will kill them both.

In her second film High Steppers, del Rio took the second female credit after Mary Astor. These films helped increase del Río's popularity. Carewe's intention was to transform her into a star to match Rudolph Valentino.\n\n1926\n\nPals First - Director, Presenter, Producer\n\nReleased August 8, 1926\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Lee Wilson Dodd, Francis Perry Elliott, Lois Leeson\n\nCast\n\nDolores del Rio – Jeanne Lamont\n\nLloyd Hughes\n\nGeorge Cooper – The Squirrel\n\nEdward Earle – Dr. Harry Chilton\n\nGeorge Reed – Uncle Alex\n\nAlice Belcher – Charley Anderson\n\nAlec B. Francis – Dominie\n\nHamilton Morse – Judge Lamont\n\nAlice Nichols – Aunt Caroline\n\n<Scenario>\n\nBased on a novel by Frances Perry Elliot, Pals First paired film star Harold Lockwood with stage favorite James Lackaye. The story focuses on two hoboes, Danny (Lockwood) and The Dominie (Lackaye). Danny is on the lam from a murder charge, while Dominie, a defrocked minister, is running away from himself. While trying to bum a meal at a Tennessee mansion, Danny is mistaken for Richard Castleman, the long-lost owner of the house. Taking advantage of the situation, the two pals enjoy a luxurious afternoon and evening, culminating with the engagement of Danny to his lovely \"cousin\" (Ruby De Rehmer). His conscience bothering him, Dominie is all for telling the truth and taking the consequences, when it turns out that Danny really is the missing Richard Castleman! Pals First was directed by Edwin Carewe, who also called the shots on the 1926 remake.\n\nHigh Steppers - Director, Producer\n\nReleased March 14, 1926\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Finis Fox, Philip Gibbs\n\nCast\n\nLloyd Hughes – Julian Perryam\n\nMary Astor – Audrey Nye\n\nDolores del Rio – Evelyn Iffield\n\nRita Carewe – Janet Perryam\n\nJohn T.

Iffield\n\nEmily Fitzroy – Mrs. Iffield\n\nMargaret McWade – Mrs. Clancy\n\n<Scenario>\n\nThis drama was a hint that perhaps the Jazz Age was beginning to wind down; its characters overcome their wild, wicked ways early in the film. Of course, there is still enough revelry to titillate 1926 audiences. As Julian Perryam, the likable but bland Lloyd Hughes is outclassed by his co-stars. Perryam is going through a round of bad luck; he is thrown out of school and loses at love. In search of a change, he heads for London, where he meets Audrey Nye (Mary Astor), a former Jazz baby who has gotten a responsible job on a newspaper. She helps Perryam get hired as a reporter. Victor Buckland (Edwards Davis) has been leading on Perryam's sister, Janet (Rita Carewe, the daughter of director Edwin Carewe). Victor's father, Cyril (John T. Murray), meanwhile, is stealing from a charitable fund. Perryam is instrumental in exposing these deeds, and a mob dynamites Buckland's building. Victor flees, and Perryam weds Audrey.\n\n1927\n\nResurrection - Director, Writer\n\nReleased March 19, 1927\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Leo Tolstoy, Edwin Carewe, Finis Fox, Ilya Tolstoy\n\nCast\n\nRod La Rocque – Prince Dimitry Ivanitch Nekhludov\n\nDolores del Rio – Katyusha Maslova\n\nRita Carewe\n\nMarc McDermott – Maj.

De Jorga\n\n<Scenario>\n\nMexican-born Dolores Del Rio is convincingly cast as a fiery Hungarian lass in Revenge. Yet another variation on The Taming of the Shrew, the film concentrates on the tempestuous relationship between whip-wielding Rascha (Del Rio), the daughter of a bear tamer, and virile Hussar officer Jorga (Leroy Mason). Kidnapping Rascha, Jorga demands that she become his wife -- and a docile, obedient one at that. The more Rascha protests against this set-up (and she puts up quite a fight!), the more Jorga falls in love with her. By film's end, Rascha is as sweet and subservient as any of her daddy's trained bears, but one still wonders how long this will last. A silent film, Revenge was released with a synchronized musical score\n\nRamona - Director\n\nReleased April 17, 1928 in Japan\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriter – Finis Fox\n\nCast\n\nDolores del Rio – Ramona\n\nWarner Baxter – Alessandro\n\nRoland Drew – Felipe\n\nVera Lewis – Senora Morena\n\nMichael Visaroff – Juan Canito\n\nJohn T. Prince – Father Salvierderra\n\nMathilde Comont – Marda\n\nCarlos Amor – Sheepherder\n\nJess Cavin – Bandit Leader\n\nRita Carewe – Baby\n\n<Scenario>\n\nThe 1928 production Ramona was the third film version of the Helen Hunt Jackson novel of the same name, first dramatized (in one reel!) by D. W. Griffith in 1910. Dolores Del Rio plays the title character, the ward of domineering California sheep rancher Senora Moreno (Vera Lewis). Escaping her cruel and judgmental guardian, Ramona sadly resigns herself to the probability that she will never find true happiness because she is -- gasp! -- a half-breed. Though she loves Moreno's grandson Felipe (Roland Drew), Ramona does not want him to bear the stigma of a mixed marriage, so she marries Allesandro (Warner Baxter), an Indian shepherd. Misfortune continues to befall the heroine when her husband is lynched by bigoted white ranchers; shortly thereafter, her baby dies from injuries sustained in a bandit raid because the white doctor refuses to treat an Indian infant. Suffering a total nervous breakdown, Ramona wanders into the woods, having lost all memory of her previous existence. But faithful Felipe rescues the girl, snapping her out of her amnesia by singing her favorite childhood song (courtesy of the Vitaphone soundtrack).\n\n1929\n\nEvangeline - Director, Producer\n\nReleased August 24, 1929\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriter – Finis Fox\n\nFilmed at Big Basin, Santa Cruz, Point Lobos, Monterey and St. Martinsville, Louisiana.\n\nCast\n\nDolores del Rio – Evangeline\n\nRoland Drew – Gabriel\n\nAlec B.

Marion – Rene La Blanc\n\nBobby Mack – Michael\n\nLouis Payne – Governor General\n\nLee Shumway – Col. Winslow\n\n<Scenario>\n\nIn the quiet Nova Scotian village of Grand-Pré lives the fair, beloved Evangeline with her father, Benedict Bellefontaine, a prosperous and honored farmer of the Acadian community. Though she admires and is loved by Baptiste, son of the notary, she is pledged to Gabriel, son of Basil, the village smith. Before they can be married, France and England declare war; the Acadians, bound by allegiance to England and by ties of kinship to France, refuse to take up arms against France, and as a result are ordered deported. As the men are herded aboard a British man-o'-war, the governor-general sets fire to the village of Grand-Pré. Suffering from exposure and broken by the sight, Benedict dies in the arms of Evangeline, who then departs for unknown lands with Father Felician. They arrive at Bayou Têche, Louisiana, where former residents of Grand Pré have established a settlement, just missing Gabriel. Through the wilds of the gulf coast, Evangeline suffers many hardships in search of her beloved, refusing the hand of Baptiste, who has meanwhile become a prosperous land owner. Basil offers to aid her in her search for Gabriel, but they are separated by a storm on the rapids. Traveling alone through unexplored country, Evangeline arrives at a settlement of Jesuits; she becomes a Sister of Mercy, though ever hopeful of finding Gabriel. At the end of the war, Evangeline is sent to Philadelphia to care for the maimed and friendless; there, in an almshouse, she is at last reunited with her long-sought beloved\n\n1930\n\nThe Spoilers The Spoilers - Director, Producer\n\nReleased September 20, 1930\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Rex Beach, Bartlett Cormack\n\nCast\n\nGary Cooper – Roy Glenister\n\nKey Johnson – Helen Chester\n\nBetty Compson – Cherry Malotte\n\nWilliam ‘Stage’ Boyd – Alec McNamera\n\nHarry Green – Herman\n\nSlim Summerville – Slapjack Simms\n\nJames Kirkwood – Joe Dextry\n\nLloyd Ingraham – Judge Stillman\n\nOscar Apfel – Struve\n\nGeorge Irving – William Wheaton\n\nKnute Erickson – Capt. Stevens\n\nHal David – Bill Wheaton\n\n•Fun Fact - Gary Cooper tore his hamstring and wrenched his back during the famous fight scene, and was in severe pain for most of the rest of the film.\n\n<Scenario>\n\nWhile traveling to Nome, Alaska, Roy Glenister (Gary Cooper) meets beautiful Helen Chester (Kay Johnson), who soon becomes his sweetheart. Glenister is one of several owners of a lucrative mine called The Midas. When he arrives in Nome, he discovers that his partners, Slapjack Simms (Slim Summerville) and Joe Dextry (James Kirkwood), are in the middle of a legal dispute with three corrupt officials: United States Marshal Voorhees (Jack Holmes), Judge Stillman (Lloyd Ingraham), and a politician named Alec McNamara (William \"Stage\" Boyd ). They have been engaged in a racket claiming titles to various mines, ejecting the miners, and then making McNamara owner of the disputed properties.\n\nThe three corrupt officials lay claim to The Midas. McNamara also steals money from Glenister, Dextry, and Slapjack, preventing them from enlisting legal help from the United States. When Dextry and Glenister plan a vigilante action, McNamara calls in a detail of soldiers to protect \"his property\". As Glenister and McNamara prepare for a gunfight, they are dissuaded by Helen, who suggests that the courts handle the dispute. Later, after jealous saloon owner Cherry Malotte (Betty Compson) lies to Glennister telling him that Helen and McNamara are conspiring to cheat him again, Glennister and McNamara settle their differences with a spectacular fistfight, with McNamara getting the worst. Afterwards, Glenister wins the hand of Helen.\n\n1931\n\nResurrection - Director, Producer\n\nReleased February 2, 1931\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nProducers – Edwin Carewe, Carl Laemmle, Jr.\n\nWriters – Finis Fox, Leo Tolstoy\n\nCast\n\nJohn Boles – Prince Dimitry Ivanitch Nekhludov\n\nLupe Velez – Katusha Maslova\n\nNance O’Neil – Aunt Marya\n\nWilliam Keighley – Capt.

This was Edwin Carewe’s first attempt at an all-talking film.\n\n1934\n\nAre We Civilized - Director, Producer\n\nReleased 1934\n\nDirector – Edwin Carewe\n\nWriters – Harold Sherman, Finis Fox\n\nCast\n\nWilliam Farnum – Paul Franklin, Jr.\n\nAnita Louise – Norma Bockner\n\nFrank McGlynn Sr. – Abraham Lincoln\n\nLeRoy Mason – Paul Franklin Jr.\n\nOscar Apfel – Dr. Leonard Gear\n\nStuart Holmes – Col.

Fowler – Mohammed\n\nBert Lindley – Christopher Columbus\n\nAaron Edwards – George Washington\n\nWilliam Humphrey – Napoleon\n\n<Scenario>\n\nSilent-film director Edwin Carewe hoped to stage a talkie comeback with his self-produced Are We Civilized? Set in a fictional European country, the story concerns the rise to power of a Hitler-like despot. A courageous newspaper publisher (William Farnum) challenges the new dictator's oppressive reign of terror, and the resultant brouhaha nearly leads to a Second World War. Overladen with symbolism, Are We Civilized? invokes the ghosts of such past movers and shakers as Abraham Lincoln, Moses, Buddha, Confucius, Julius Caesar, Christopher Columbus, George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte and even Jesus Christ to hammer home its pacifistic message (the film wants to be both anti-war and anti-dictators, which history has proven to be an oxymoronic set of circumstances). Director Carewe fleshes out his film with generous stock footage from silent Cecil B. DeMille, D. W. Griffith and Thomas Ince historical epics. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nE-Book\n\nSources\n\nImdb.com\n\nBroadwayworld.com\n\nColoradofilm.com\n\nLearnaboutmovieposters.com\n\nCITWF.com\n\nSilentcinema.com\n\nAFI.com\n\nMovies.NYTimes.com\n\nMRQE.com\n\nFan.TCM.com\n\nEn.Wikipedia.org\n\nMoviefone.com\n\nNitrateVille.com\n\nIBDB.com\n\nArchive.org"
