As a French Protestant, she was subject to increasing religious harassment and persecution under King Louis XIV in the later part of the 17th Century.\n\nIn around 1667, at about 17 years old, Marguerite married Nicolas de Lanoy, b: 1640, also from the Pas-de-Calais province in the north of France. He was most-likely part of the Huguenot congregation in the town of Guînes, near Calais. The couple married in Pas-de-Calais, France. They were of the French \"petite noblesse\" or rural landed-gentry, a number of whom converted to the \"reformed religion\" preached by Jean Calvin between 1550 and 1650.\n\nMarguerite and Nicolas had 5 children, all born in Europe:[1]\n\nFrancois de Lanoy, b: ca. 1670 in France\n\nMarie de Lanoy, b. ca. 1675, d. b 1 Oct 1704 in Cape Colony\n\nNicolas de Lanoy, b. ca. 1678 in France\n\nMathieu de Lanoy, b. ca. 1679 in France or Holland\n\nSuzanne de Lanoy, b. ca. 1680 in France or Holland\n\nThe family emigrated, doubtlessly via the Protestant-ruled Netherlands / Holland, to the Dutch Cape Colony in South Africa on December 31, 1687, with a group of Huguenot colonists, among the first in the region.[2][3]\n\nNicolas de Lanoy apparently died shortly after their arrival in the Cape Colony, around 1688. His widow and her 2 oldest boys received local public assistance as of 1690. Her daughter, Marie de Lanoy, married a fellow-French Huguenot refugee, Ary Lecremant (aka Arij Lekkerwijn) in 1692 at 17 years old. At his death in 1697, she remarried to Hans Heinrich Hatting on 19 January 1698.[4]\n\nMarguerite (de France) de Lanoy died at Groot Drakenstein in the Dutch Cape Colony, South Africa, at 58 years old. As she was born around/before 1650, this would have been around 1705.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Pieter Coertzen, \"The Huguenots of South Africa 1688-1988\" (28 Wale Street, Cape Town: Tafelberg Publishers Limited, 1988), p. 158.

States the family was from \"Wynen, Flandres\". This is not a village name; it means \"wines\" in Flemish, indicating their area produced wine. Similarly, Marguerite's daughter's 1st husband's French surname was listed as \"Decrement,\" meaning \"Sweet-Wine;\" its Dutch translation was \"Lekkerwijn\". [\"Lecrevent\" is a mis-spelling of Lecrement].\n\nWells & Scott Genealogy (USA & South Africa) Marie de Lanoy Probably lists her parents' birth years as a bit too early; other sources state they were born closer to 1650.\n\nBoucher.M (1981). \"French speakers at the Cape: The European Background,\" Pretoria, UNISA.
