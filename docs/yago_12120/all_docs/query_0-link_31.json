        "text": "This article from 1926 was first published in Motion Picture Classic magazine in August 1926. It is, on the surface, a piece about the demolition of the old Paramount studios. But there appears to be something more going on here. The Jazz Singer was released just over a year later and, with that in mind, this can be read more as a goodbye to the “old” Hollywood, and the author seems somewhat conflicted about whether those changes are good or bad. The piece starts off rather lyrically, but about mid-way through it becomes little more than a list of who was still acting, who was retired, who was living, and who dead. Not all of the information given was the truth, and my notes at the end try to correct this. The above picture is from the first page of the article in question.\n\nThe Haunted Home of Movie Ghosts\n\nBy Robert Donaldson\n\n(Motion Picture Classic, August 1926)\n\nThe Old Lasky Studio in Hollywood Has Become But a Memory. A New Day – With Its New Demands – Has Dawned. Which Means a Bigger and Better Studio Is Being Erected to Film the Paramount Stories.\n\n“I feel like one who walks alone\n\nSome banquet hall deserted,\n\nWhose Lights are fled,\n\nWhose garlands dead,\n\nAnd all but he departed.”\n\nTHOMAS MOORE.\n\nThe pepper-trees are the same on Vine Street in Hollywood, and even, for the time being, the grey exterior of the wooden two-story office-building that stretches the length of the block is untouched and as placid as ever. To the outward eye, the Famous Players-Lasky studio, for years a Hollywood landmark, is unchanged.\n\nYet its heart is gone, and today it is haunted by ghosts, musing ghosts in film finery, who hover about watching the busy crews of wreckers as they destroy.\n\nFor the old studio is no more. The glass, from the enormous roots over the stages is crashing and falling. A structural steel crane is lifting the great beams from their places and laying them side by side near the street. The floors of the stages, floors that have felt the tread of the panorama of movie great (sic), and have borne the weight of the most lavish sets ever erected by Cecil B. De Mille and Allan Dwan and James Cruze, are being torn up. From one side of the city block to the other, the view is unimpaired, where only yesterday one could not see because of the forest of “sets.”\n\nIt is Moving Day\n\nThe long row of dressing-rooms, which housed extras who became stars, and in some cases housed stars who became extras, has gone.\n\nPola Negri’s bungalow – it used to be Mary Pickford’s in the days when Douglas Fairbanks met and fell in love with her – still stands, and so does Gloria Swanson’s, at the opposite end of the lot. But soon, they too, will fall prey to the wreckers.\n\nThe paneling of Jesse L. Lasky’s private office, where contracts that have meant millions to stars have been signed, has been removed and transported to the new studio. Cecil B. De Mille’s churchlike private office was converted some time ago into a projection-room. If these offices could only talk! – what tales they would tell of fame and fortune, of tears and heartaches, of gambler’s chances that won, and great ideas that failed!\n\nFamous Players-Lasky is moving its studio. A new day, a new need. Their two city blocks in the heart of Hollywood is now too small to handle the immense productions the company is making, and the old facilities have become inadequate. So the United Studios lot, off Melrose Avenue, was purchased. The old Lasky lot had ten acres, the new has sixteen. The new lot will have eleven enormous stages. The old had but six, two of them quite small. While the crash and destruction of the wreckers is heard on Vine Street, the pleasant ringing of hammers is heard on Melrose, where a horde of carpenters, masons and plasterers is preparing the new home.\n\nThe Parade of the Specters\n\nGhosts…ghosts…they pass in Midnight Review, like the return before the eyes of the exiled Napoleon at Elba, of his famous marshals, parading in array victorious before him – for the glory of Napoleon and of France.\n\nGhosts…ghosts of film fame, return to this battle-field once illumined with the flare of sun-arcs and Kleigs, once raging with the fierce competition of celluloid rivalries. Ghosts that muse on the fickleness of popular acclaim, ghosts that bow in defeat before the remorselessness of Age – ghosts here and there that bow before the folly of extravagance and riotous living.\n\nAs the shadows of the pepper-trees flicker across the fence, it almost seems that the notes from Wally Reid’s saxophone can be heard from one of the stages…gay, happy, tragic Wally, grinding out eight and nine pictures a year, continuing work when he had to be carried on the set, forcing a smile, making the executives think it was only another irrepressible gag.\n\nIn the distance seems to move the enigmatic, courtly figure of William Desmond Taylor, whose murder created one of the unsolved mysteries in recent years…and just beyond is a girl in golden curls that he is directing; Mary Miles Minter, another ghost, at the age of twenty-two, her film career ended – because of the tragedy.\n\nJust Memories\n\nJames Neill, the character actor, passes in the flesh. As he looks on the ruins, he murmurs the verse quoted at the beginning of this story – “I feel like one who walks alone, some banquet hall deserted –” Neill played in the very first picture made on this lot.\n\n“What memories! What memories!” he said to me. “I remember the early days, when that old barn at the corner was the whole studio. I owned the only automobile – an old Buick. It was the sole car parked under the pepper-trees of Vine Street, where now there are hundreds. Jesse Lasky walked to work, and so did Cecil De Mille, and Samuel Goldwyn. Dustin Farnum, the star, owned a car in New York, but he hadn’t brought it with him. The studio, for its location trips, had three old Pope-Hartfords. Later, Mr. Lasky purchased a small foreign car.\n\nDustin Farnum! Why, isn’t that his name on the Orpheum 24-sheet across the street, advertising him in The Littlest Rebel[1]?\n\nDustin Farnum, the man who missed an opportunity to make a million on this very spot! He and Lasky and De Mille and Goldwyn were the original four partners in the concern. The other three put in $5,000 apiece. Farnum was to get his quarter interest in stock in return for acting in the first picture, The Squaw Man.[2] At the last minute he decided he wanted the $5,000 in cash, and gave back the stock, and the other three took it reluctantly because they had a hard time finding the $5,000. Today, if Farnum had retained the stock, it would be worth more than $1,000,000, not to speak of the many dividends. But he took the $5,000…and is still playing on the Orpheum, so the billboard says.\n\nOnward Stalk the Shadows\n\nIn the tide of traffic that swirls by, one sees another ghost, a chastened, somewhat shrunken ghost with a serious face, who passes in an unobtrusive inexpensive car. He casts a pondering glance at the partially demolished studio. Whatever may be his thoughts, they are well hidden behind the immobile mask of his countenance. It is Fatty Arbuckle, and the door which he is now hurrying past is the same to which he used to drive with a grand flourish in a red-and-gold custom-built automobile. Today he is on his way the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot, where he is directing under the name of William Goodrich.\n\nGhosts of dead heroes and heroines, of men and women who laughed and loved in the celluloid world of make-believe, haunt the spot. Most of them worked there, all of them knew it as a landmark: Edward S. Abeles, Harry Woodruff, Bobby Harron, Alan Holubar, the director, all dead. Glorious Barbara La Marr, who died at the pinnacle of her fame; Harold Lockwood, victim of the “flu” epidemic, and brave Larry Paton, who paid the price in France. Arthur Johnson and John Bunny passed away before the studio was well known, but Bunny’s leading lady, Flora Finch, recently appeared in a small role in Gloria Swanson’s latest Paramount Picture.[3] Charles Ogle, the character actor, is retired and living at Long Beach, California. He has no telephone – because the casting directors insist on trying to lure him back to the screen.[4]\n\nFill the Cup and Toast Them\n\nHow the ghost names haunt his famous world of filmdom! Like Napoleon’s conquering army, the ranks are always full, for as soon as one hero falls, another steps in to fill the gap!\n\nFlorence Turner stopped a moment on the avenue to look at the scene of destruction. Once a shining light of movie stardom, she recently returned to the screen in mother rôles.[5] Moths in the flame…\n\nRuth Roland, the heroine of the thrillers, dressed in a chic business suit, slows down in her car to pay passing tribute. She is on her way to close a big business deal, for Ruth is now a real-estate operator of note in Los Angeles. Her name is posted on countless lots in the city.\n\nBryant Washburn enters the gates – on his way to hold a short conference with Raymond Griffith. Five years ago he was a big star on the lot. Raymond Griffith was then an unknown. Today Griffith is a big star – and Washburn recently returned to the screen, playing a second lead in support of Griffith.[6]\n\n“Life’s all right – as long as you have a sense of humor,” he smiled in passing.\n\nTime Was When…\n\nThe faint ghostly trilling of soprano notes recalls Geraldine Farrar, as famous in pictures as she was on the operatic stage. She is now in retirement so far as both arts go, and is living at Ridgefield, New Jersey.[7]\n\nA shadow from the land of the Rising Sun is Sessue Hayakawa, who recently returned to this country from France, where he has been making pictures. One he was famous in Hollywood. Today there is a younger generation that scarcely knows him. He is now trying his luck on the stage.[8]\n\nDapper Charlie Chaplin rides by on his way to his own lot. He casts a passing glance at Pola Negri’s bungalow…\n\nA doorway of the star dressing-room building that is being torn down reveals the name of Kathlyn Williams…she has retired from the screen, and is living abroad with her husband, Charles Eyton.[9] Another doorway reveals that name of Betty Compson, now Mrs. James Cruze. She is now featured in all-star casts…but her friends are predicting she will come back – to stardom.\n\nIn the Days of the Nickelodeon\n\nMemories…memories…Carlyle Blackwell is in vaudeville in England.[10] Fanny Ward is retired and living in Paris,[11] and so is Pearl White. Maurice Costello is on the stage in this country, but his two beautiful daughters, Dolores and Helene, are “carrying on” the Costello name in the films with tremendous success.[12] James Cruze, once famous as a leading man, and especially famous in The Million-Dollar Mystery,[13] in which his ex-wife, Marguerite Snow, played opposite him, is now one of the big directors, and is filming Old Ironsides.[14] Miss Snow is in vaudeville. Francis X Bushman is still in pictures, having last appeared in Ben-Hur.[15] J. Warren Kerrigan occasionally returns to the screen, as in The Covered Wagon.[16] He is living in semi-retirement in Hollywood.\n\nKing Baggot, Francis Ford, Robert Z. Leonard and Alan Hale are all directors, and Marshall Neilan, once tremendously popular as an actor, is now one of the biggest of directors.\n\nJuanita Hansen, once a Sennett bathing beauty and later a dramatic player, is in retirement.\n\nBetty Blythe is making pictures abroad, tho she is scarcely heard of any more. Mae Murray, another old-timer, is still going strong. Beverly Bayne is only seen at intervals on the screen.[17]\n\nOnce Upon a Time\n\nLois Weber, once a star, and former wife of Phillips Smalley, who played opposite her in most pictures, is the only woman director in the business, and is making a picture for Universal. Smalley is on the stage.\n\nIrving Cummings, an old-time hero, is directing. Mabel Normand, after a time out of pictures during which she was on the stage, has just returned and signed a half-million-dollar contract with Hal Roach. Another old-time actor is now the king of comedy producers – Mack Sennett. Theda Bara, once the vamp of vamps, is now trying to come back as a comedienne.[18]\n\nMabel Van Buren, the first leading lady at the studio, has retired altogether from the screen.[19] So have Edith Storey, Pauline Bush, Patty Darwell,[20] Grace Cunard,[21] Bessie Barriscale, Anita King, Marie Doro and Edna Goodrich. Marguerite Clark is married to a very wealthy New Orleans business man, and is no longer in pictures. Mae Marsh recently made a picture in England, but is now practically retired and living in Flintridge, California.[22] She is the wife of Louis Lee Arms, well-known newspaper man, and has two charming children.\n\nThe Fast Thinning Line\n\nAlice Joyce, once known as the “Kalem Girl,” continues her old-time popularity, and recently appeared in Mannequin[23] and Beau Geste.[24] Blanche Sweet, Marshall Neilan’s wife, is as popular as ever, and is now appearing in Diplomacy, which her husband is directing.[25]\n\nValeska Surratt has retired and is living in New York.\n\nConstance Binney left the atmosphere of the Kleigs some time ago in order to marry a Boston banker.\n\nHenry B. Walthall, famed as the “little colonel” in The Birth of a Nation,[26] after being out of pictures for some time, recently staged a comeback, as did Katherine McDonald.[27] Marguerite Fisher is married and is playing mother rôles and second leads.\n\nBut the passing flicker of film fame, like the verdict between the gladiators and the lions in the old Roman arena, is not always unkind.\n\nMary Pickford is still at the top of picturedom, and so are Doug Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. Owen Moore, Matt Moore and Tom Moore are still high in popularity. Thomas Meighan, another old-timer, so far as picture history goes, is still at the top of the heap, and Gloria Swanson is a star of stars.\n\nRobert Edeson, Hobart Bosworth, James Neill, William S. Hart, Shirley Mason, Viola Dana, Noah Beery, Wallace Beery, Dorothy and Lillian Gish, are all still receiving the rewards of popular favor.[28] Wallace Beery, after many ups and downs, is firmly established as one of the greatest of them all, vying for honors as a character actor only with a comparative newcomer in pictures – Ernest Torrence.\n\nRaymond Hatton is still keeping the even tenor of his way before for the cameras. Marjorie Daw is still prospering before the Kleigs.\n\nSome of them have passed clear out of the picture – into new realms. For instance, “Broncho Billy” Anderson is now running a string of race-horses at Tia Juana. And “Texas” Guinan, once famed as a picture star, is a witty ad lib. hostess at a New York night club. Elliott Dexter is on the stage, and so is Robert Warwick.[29] Vivian Martin is in musical comedy.\n\nDear old Theodore Roberts, the “grand old man” of pictures, is gradually regaining his health after a long siege of illness, and has just appeared in his first picture in two years – The Cat’s Pajamas.[30] He is now making a vaudeville tour. His big house on the hill, at the head of Vine Street, looks sadly down on the wrecked studio, where he came as one of the first actors, and where his portable garage, which he used as a dressing-room, was moved all over the lot as expansion began to take place.\n\nLike Ships That Pass in the Night\n\nGhosts…ghosts that seem to tread softly in the gathering darkness, ghosts that will soon be homeless, wandering sadly thru a new maze of buildings that will spring up on this site. Store buildings, cold, prosy, unromantic; buildings that will not bask gently under the pepper-trees, buildings that will not hide the glitter and pageantry of filmdom; ghosts that will turn over a dead leaf and poke into an odd corner in hope of finding a faded remnant of the studio glory that was. Ghosts that would not feel easy, ghosts who might even be unknown, should they haunt the bright modern buildings of the new studio where the army of film great, ever recruited anew, marches on and on, down the pathways of celluloid fame.\n\n[1] Farnum was in a stage production of The Littlest Rebel on Broadway between November 1911 and January 1912. The dates of when he was in the production at the Orpheum in L.A. are unknown.\n\n[2] The Squaw Man (dir. Cecil B DeMille, 1914)\n\n[3] No evidence has been found to say that this is true.\n\n[4] Charles Ogle retired in 1926 (the year of this article).\n\n[5] Florence Turner’s break from the screen was between 1916 and 1919 – ending some seven years before this article was written – hardly “recent.”\n\n[6] Wet Paint (dir. Arthur Rosson, 1926)\n\n[7] While she was no longer appearing in staged operas, Farrar continued giving recitals until 1931.\n\n[8] With the exception of Daughter of the Dragon (dir. Lloyd Corrigan) in 1931, Hayakawa made no films in Hollywood between 1922 and 1949.\n\n[9] Williams returned to the screen after a two-year absence in 1927 with Sally in Our Alley (Walter Lang), and continued working steadily through the 1920s. Her last film was released in 1935.\n\n[10] Carlyle made films in the UK until 1930, as well as starring as Sherlock Holmes in a German silent film version of Der Hund von Baskerville (dir. Richard Oswald, 1929).\n\n[11] Actually “Fannie Ward.”\n\n[12] Maurice Costello was still working in film at the time this article came out, and continued to do so until 1928. His filmography resumes in 1934, but mostly in small or uncredited roles.\n\n[13] The Million Dollar Mystery (dir. Howard Hansel, 1914).\n\n[14] Old Ironsides (dir. James Cruze, 1926).\n\n[15] Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (dir. Fred Niblo, 1925).\n\n[16] The Covered Wagon (dir. James Cruze, 1923).\n\n[17] With the exception of an uncredited part in The Naked City (dir. Jules Dassin), Beverly Bayne’s last role for the big screen was Passionate Youth (dir. Dallas M. Fitzgerald, 1925).\n\n[18] Both Normand and Bara only made a handful of films during their mid-twenties attempt at a comeback, and then left film for good.\n\n[19] This was not the case, and she continued appearing in films throughout the 1920s.\n\n[20] Jane (Patti) Darwell would return to film in 1930 and work prolifically until her final role as The Bird Woman in Mary Poppins (Robert Sevenson, 1964).\n\n[21] Grace Cunard had not retired, and worked steadily until the mid-1940s, albeit in supporting (and, later, uncredited) roles.\n\n[22] The Rat (dir. Graham Cutts, 1925). Mae Marsh returned to film in 1931 and continued acting until the mid-1960s.\n\n[23] Mannequin (dir. James Cruze, 1926).\n\n[24] Beau Geste (dir. Herbert Brenon, 1926).\n\n[25] Diplomacy (dir. Marshall Neilan, 1926).\n\n[26] The Birth of a Nation (dir. D. W. Griffith, 1915).\n\n[27] Katherine McDonald’s comeback was not to be. It lasted two films, and she made no films after 1926.\n\n[28] William S. Hart released his final film a year prior to this article being published.\n\n[29] Robert Warwick returned to the screen in 1929 and acted prolifically until 1962."
