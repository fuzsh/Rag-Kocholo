        "text": "Marguerite Jane “Peg” Kauffman, 70, of Davenport, finished her life journey surrounded by her family on June 28, 2024.\n\nPeg was born on May 11, 1954 in Davenport, to Vera and Willis Eikenberry. She attended Bettendorf schools, graduating from Bettendorf High School in 1972. Peg married James Kauffman in 1974 and they had two children, Jimmy and Amanda. After their divorce in 1978, Peg spent 38 years with Richard Halfman.\n\nPeg worked various jobs; driving a city bus, waitressing at Ross’ Restaurant in Bettendorf, manager of One Stop Mart Gas Stations before moving on to Walmart on Elmore Avenue in Davenport for 26 years, retiring in 2011.\n\nPeg had a very giving spirit, which was evident when she donated her kidney to a friend. She was an avid reader of Danielle Steel books. She loved cooking and baking, collecting Snow Babies, and had one of the greenest thumbs around, growing any plant she could get her hands on into a beautiful work of art.\n\nHer pride and joys on this earth were her grandchildren: Andrew (Jessica), Kaitlyn, Ashley, Jishaun, Molly, Maddie, Bailey, Connor and great-grandchildren: Natalie, Hailey, James, Levi, and Clint.\n\nPeg is survived by her children: James (Mary) Kauffman, DeForest, Wisconsin and Amanda Kauffman, Davenport, and “son-in-law” Gary Andrade, Davenport; her grandchildren and great-grandchildren along with her favorite “child”, her dog, Milo.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, a brother, Jack, and her dogs, Abby and Major.\n\nPeg requested cremation rites and no services. She will be celebrated with family and close friends at a later date. Halligan-McCabe-DeVries Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements. Memorials may be made to the Scott County Humane Society or to the family to establish a memorial at a later date."
