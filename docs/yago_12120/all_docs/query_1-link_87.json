        "text": "One hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley reported on a brand-new fad: all things King Tut. Jewelry, clothes and hats inspired by what had been recently found in his tomb were the latest thing for young actresses. She pointed out a pitfall in wearing things you know very little about:\n\nThat is, her clothes and jewelry are ornamented with King Tutankhamun symbols. And some of those symbols oh, tut, tut! It is said they would make the most confirmed Egyptologist blush! But the flapper doesn’t know what they mean, so she should worry.\n\nDear old King Tut, in all his majesty, never dreamed of what frivolous uses his praises to Isis would be put to. Wouldn’t he just be annoyed to find his most sacred and dignified symbols covering the frivolous bosom of the flapper or resting saucily on her head?\n\nThen again, maybe the hieroglyphics adorning the young ladies were just grain reports, and “wouldn’t a fashionable flapper be mad if she thought that the rich, gay, saucy looking jacquette from Paris which she is wearing bore such a hayseed record as that?”\n\nKingsley also mentioned that interest in him was so recent, that “nobody can pronounce King Tutankhamun’s name. Tut-Come-On is the nearest we can come to it.” It’s odd to remember that there was a time when his name wasn’t common knowledge.\n\nThere was already some interest in ancient Egypt locally before the find; Sid Grauman’s Egyptian Theater in Hollywood had opened in the previous October. But fascination with Tut was like nothing else before, because when Howard Carter looked through the peephole into the tomb’s antechamber on November 4, 1922, he saw the first Egyptian ruler’s burial place to be found that (for the most part) hadn’t been disturbed since its burial. He telegraphed his patron, the Earl of Carnavon, and waited to explore further until he arrived from London on November 23, 1922. The workers started clearing debris from around the entrance, and on November 26th they reached a sealed doorway. They unsealed it and Carter had a look. Carter later wrote, “At first I could see nothing, the hot air escaping from the chamber causing the candle flame to flicker, but presently, as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues, and gold – everywhere the glint of gold.”\n\nNews of the find didn’t break right away. Carnarvon gave a press conference in London on December 23th and he told the world about the “wealth of jewels and gold and historical treasure that almost baffles his powers of description.” The L.A. Times’ report on it ran in the middle of its second section, but that didn’t last for long: later reports were front-page news. Tutmania was about to begin.\n\nOn January 22, 1923 the Times started running a series of articles by British journalist H.V. Morton, who traveled to Egypt to report on the opening of the tomb. He cabled his reports to newspapers around the world.\n\nOn February 15th, Morton began his reports from the scene with descriptions of tourists picnicking in the August-like heat, “the tawny hillsides for miles around are dotted with exhausted damsels and shaken matrons feebly waving fly whisks and wearing blue sun goggles.” They were occasionally rewarded by the sight of items being removed, like the “golden-legged, lion-headed couch certainly one of the most beautiful objects taken from the tomb.”\n\nFebruary 16, 1923 was the official opening of the burial chamber, with government officials attending. Morton wasn’t among the 20 people allowed in then. When they came out, they said they were awestruck by the gold sarcophagus and the wall paintings of the gods that were “bright as new.” There was so much in there that there was no room to walk in.\n\nThey took a one day break, then on February 18th they allowed the press and the public in. Morton set the scene, saying “today it was a social occasion. Women in filmy summer dresses in the blazing sunshine holding gaily colored parasols and men in flannels busy with luncheon baskets.” Then he described what he saw:\n\ninside were the King’s jewels, sparkling in the electric lights as if awakened after centuries to show their beauty…Most bewildering is the second chamber, with its confusion of articles necessary for the welfare of the royal soul in the other world. Gilded chariots stand as if the horses had just been unyoked and taken to the stables.\n\nThe following day the archeologists announced plans to close up the tomb on the 26th, and continue the next season. Work went on at the site for several years.\n\nTutmania struck fairly quickly–Kingsley’s article on the trend was less than two months after that. Of course, it wasn’t only in Hollywood: on March 31st the trade paper Camera had reported:\n\neverything in New York is Egyptian, the influence being exerted on civilization by the discover of King Tut-ankh-amen’s tomb. Leading theatrical producers are planning Egyptian shows, designers are making dresses that look like the bottom of the Nile and which give our slim citizens an opportunity to look more like a meridian of longitude.\n\nHollywood quickly jumped on the bandwagon and made Tut-inspired movies. The first was a one-reel nonfiction film called The Land of Tut-Ankh-Amen from Fox that included scenes of the Egyptian countryside, well-known ruins, and footage of the uncovered tomb as well as scenes of Museum of Natural History workers on the job. It came out in early June. It was quickly followed by King Tut-Ankh-Amen’s Eighth Wife released on July 1 and sold on a states-rights basis. The trade papers didn’t bother to review it.\n\nHowever, the biggest film of this sort began production with the title King Tut-Ankh-Amen. It starred Carmel Myers of the tennis dress above and Kingsley got to visit its set. After reporting that they were using matte paintings instead of scenery (and explaining how that worked), she told about the exciting scene that was being filmed: Carmel Myers dancing with a leopard.\n\nCarmel dances. She whirls closer and closer to the beast. He strikes at her; his claw grazes her whirling garments, but somehow doesn’t catch. How she does it I don’t know—but she keeps on smiling bravely and finishes the dance. “Well, that was thrill enough for me!” she cries as she snatches up her coat to put around her. “No more circus scenes for me, I hope!”\n\nKingsley mentioned that the following day, Myers was going to be rescued from crocodiles and she observed that “every ancient picture nowadays is more or less a zoo opus—in addition there would be camels, elephants and a lion or two.”\n\nUnfortunately for the film, Tutmania didn’t last long enough. By the time the movie came out in October, they decided to change the name to The Dancer of the Nile and barely mentioned the pharoah in the advertising. Film Daily gave the plot: it “deals with the loves and hates of an Egyptian princess” who gets together with Tut at the end. However, it wasn’t just boredom with Tut that made Dancer less successful than they would have liked: it was a crummy movie. Film Daily’s review was scathing, saying, “Egyptian setting may serve to hold their attention although theme never warrants the trouble they have gone to to make the production; not likely to be taken seriously. A poor entertainment on the whole…A lot of things in this that are more than likely to be laughed at.”\n\nThe backlash against had Tutmania was evident elsewhere; Motion Picture Magazine reported on a new policy on Buster Keaton’s set for The Three Ages:\n\nFive dollar fine for any employee of this studio who springs a joke on King Tut, former Egyptian who was recently disinterred…We want genuine laughs around the studio, not Tut titterings.\n\nHowever, unlike most fads that die quickly, this one comes back periodically. According to a recent article in the New Yorker called “Why King Tut is Still Facinating,” this one is here again.\n\nHoward Carter and A.C.

He is with us again, this time kidding in his own entirely inimitable way through a comedy golf act, after which he trots out the old tin Lizzie. Langdon is awfully funny, with his simp map and talk.\n\nKingsley didn’t know it at the time, but this was Harry Langdon’s farewell vaudeville tour: he was about to sign a film contract. After a few false starts, he would become one of the top four comedians of the silent era, joining Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd.\n\nLangdon’s act was called After the Ball, and his co-stars were his wife, Rose, and her sister Cecilia Musolff. ‘Fred.’ in Variety described it when it debuted in 1921:\n\nThe first scene is on a golf course with Rose and Cecil clad in striking golf costumes, doing more gabbing than golfing, and Harry caddying along behind them. There are chances here that will work out. The second scene, in full stage, at the front of the club house will build up to be as funny as the front of the road house in time. As it stands now it has a lot of laughs, but they are not of the “wow” quality.\n\nFinally the auto bit is used for the closing scene. It is different from the old car stuff. This time it is a smart looking roadster with the girls in the front seat and Harry riding in the rear. Some of the copper stuff is used and still gets laughs. The prop tin cans in the hood and the blow torch backfire bit from the old act is still present and lands with the usual effect.\n\nThe three scenes make pretty stage pictures and the two girls show to advantage in the smartly cut golf clothes with knickers and hose. Harry is the same boob character as of yore and quite as funny in his inimitable way.\n\nBy the time Kingsley saw it, they had apparently improved on the less-than “wow” bits. Harry Langdon had been on the stage for decades at this point. Born in Council Bluffs, Iowa on June 15, 1884, he’d been working in show business since he was a teen-ager, first in traveling medicine shows, circuses and stock companies, then after he married fellow performer Rose Frances Musolff in 1903 they moved into vaudeville. Over the years they put together a trick-car act called A Night on the Boulevard, and in 1914 Billboard saw it at the Alhambra in New York City. They said that the Langdons: “found the going just made to suit their gait. Harry Langdon is a first-rate comedian of the quiet type and Rose Langdon an excellent feeder. The dialogue in and out of the automobile got laugh after laugh. Twenty minutes, full stage, two bows.”\n\nThe Langdons were a big success. By 1916 they’d added Harry’s younger brother James to the act and renamed it Johnny’s New Car, and after seeing it at the top venue in New York City, the Palace, Billboard was even more impressed, calling it “one of the funniest acts in present-day vaudeville. The Langdons have a piece of property that is bound to add to their long list of successes. Harry Langdon does the comedy and knows the art well. The trick automobile, together with the beautiful boulevard set, came in for much applause. The Langdons will find little trouble in securing booking for their excellent comedy. Nineteen minutes in four; four curtains.”\n\nIn 1918 they headlined at the Pantages in Los Angeles with the same act, but James had been replaced by Cecilia. The Los Angeles Times unsigned review said they were still very funny and called it “their ninety-mile-an-hour comedy playlet, Johnny’s New Car which realistically portrays the difficulties and humiliations that arise from being a proud filver owner.”\n\nWhen it came time to freshen up the act in 1921, they didn’t throw out all of their well-tested material, they just added jokes from the new craze, golf. They could have continued touring for many years, but at the end of the same month Kingsley was seeing them in 1923, Harry Langdon signed a contract with Sol Lesser’s Principal Pictures Corporation to make movies as soon as he finished his current tour. This of course broke up the act; Cecilia Musolff quit show business and married Oscar Boese, a theater stage manager in Milwaukee. Rose briefly tried acting in film: she had a small part in Tod Browning’s The Road to Mandalay (1926). She divorced Harry in 1928, charging him with cruelty by “showing attentions to another girl with whom Langdon has often been seen in public” according to Variety. She married again in 1929 and she died in 1965.\n\nAfter he finished his 1923 Orpheum tour, Langdon returned to Los Angeles and began his film career. In July 1923, the Times reported that his comedy short, The Aerial Mail, was in the cutting room. It was also called The New Mail Man and The Skyscraper in the press, but I couldn’t find a record of a film with any of those names being released. Lesser’s company was having financial trouble at the time, so perhaps they didn’t have the money to finish it. Mack Sennett took the opportunity to make a two-reeler with Langdon called Look Pleasant (later released as Smile Please) and Sennett approved of the results, telling the Times that he “is even funnier on the screen than on stage, and you know what a riot he was at the Orpheum a few months ago.” He signed Langdon to a two-year contract in November 1923. After about a year, they discovered the slower-paced comedy style that suited him, and they began to make the sort of films he’s remembered for like Saturday Afternoon (1925) and The Strong Man (1926). If you’d like to learn more about his film career, visit Lea Stans’ article at Classic Movie Hub.\n\nReading his stage reviews, you only wonder why he didn’t go into the movies sooner. Perhaps it was because he was such a big success in vaudeville, he didn’t see the need to leave.\n\n“Alhambra, New York,” The Billboard, October 24, 1914, p.10.\n\nFred. “New Acts This Week,” Variety, November 25, 1921, p. 21.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Sumurun Still Leads,” Los Angeles Times, March 28, 1916.\n\n“Langdons Divorced,” Variety, May 2, 1928, p. 9.\n\n“Mack Sennett Ties Up Harry Langdon,” Los Angeles Times, November 10, 1923.\n\n“The Palace,” The Billboard, July 22, 1916, p. 7.\n\n“Reviews,” Los Angeles Times, March 6, 1918.\n\n“Rose Langdon Too,” Variety, May 12, 1926, p. 22.\n\n“Vaudeville,” New York Clipper, December 13, 1916, p.8.\n\n“Vaudeville Star Signed to Make Film Comedies,” Los Angeles Times, March 31, 1923.\n\n“What’s Going On at West Coast Studios,” Los Angeles Times, July 18, 1923.\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley was still annoyed that The Sheik (1921) wasn’t dirty enough, but she was happy to see one of her favorite actors spoof it in the latest Mack Sennett feature, The Shriek of Araby:\n\nI used to wonder why The Sheik, all denatured, was ever put on the screen. Now I know. It was so Ben Turpin could make a burlesque of it! Ben Turpin is an artist. When I say that, I can just see Ben’s pathetic eyes reproaching me. But I mean nothing highbrow. Ben, I just mean you have a huge sense of comedy, and know how to make every move, every look count in putting it over. Your comedy goes a lot deeper than just your erratic eyes.\n\nThere’s a good deal more action in The Shriek than there was in The Sheik. And yet, good as it all is, the subtitles add another 100 percent to the fun…In short, if you want to laugh and forget your troubles, be sure and see The Shriek of Araby.\n\nKingsley always did appreciate a good laugh (and a good comic). Not too many other reviewers wrote about the film, but Exhibitors’ Herald called it “a delightfully funny farce comedy and while it has been some time since we’ve seen Ben Turpin, he’s just as amusing as ever…There are bathing girls and swimming pools and everything a Sennett comedy usually has and the action is fast and furious.” However, now it isn’t well-regarded; Sennett historian Brent Walker wrote “The Shriek of Araby is not particularly noteworthy as a comedy feature.” However, he probably hadn’t been seeing a bunch of desert movies in desperate need of deflating recently.\n\nFor Kingsley, she wasn’t only happy to laugh at Turpin, she got to laugh at tropes that had begun to irritate her. She had aired out her grievances with Sahara melodramas in August 1922 after “quite a crowd of these bush-league sheiks have been showing up in the movies lately.” Kingsley questioned how romantic life in the desert would be, because it would involve a lack of soap and toothbrushes and too many mosquitos and (especially) fleas. She also objected to the difference between ‘real’ and ‘movie’ sheiks: “In real life, the sheik is probably a pretty fresh fellow. But in the pictures he is a cross between a Sunday-school superintendent and a minor poet. When he starts making love to the girl, but finds her refractory, he merely wipes away a tear and goes forth nobly, conquering his baser self.”\n\nThe knock-offs pretty much used the same plot as The Sheik. The young woman tries to escape, he finds her and:\n\n“then suddenly—she knows! For no reason whatever he now looks good to her. But love is as hectic as a midsummer magazine cover. She carefully conceals her love—so as to make the picture last five reels—until one day somebody comes to rescue her. The sheik looks into her eyes and then it is his turn to know.”\n\nAt that point the censor-ordered minster turns up, and “they put five dots after the subtitle.” And then, “next time you see the pair, there is a little stranger running about the hot sands.”\n\nIn Sherlock, Jr., Buster Keaton wondered how that happened, too\n\nSo Kingsley was all ready to see Ben Turpin romp around the sands. Nevertheless, before the countless bush-league sheiks, film writers liked The Sheik well enough. As usual, Kingsley didn’t get to review such a major film when it debuted in Los Angeles on October 30, 1921. Her editor Edwin Schallert went, and he thought the attack on the walled city at the climax was “the best stuff of its kind that has been seen on the screen in some time.” He liked the rest of the movie less: “you wait, however, an interminable length for the action of the climax to get there. For compensation you are allowed to watch the stupid love affair between an English girl and a desert chieftain. I suppose that this love affair was intended to be a superheated affair, but as actually viewed on the screen it is as tame as a school child’s romance.” He didn’t blame the star for the dull bits, saying “Rudolph Valentino appears as the chieftain and plays the part with probably as much conviction as the part allows.”\n\nThe trade reviews praised the action scenes and the way the film looked over the love scenes, too. Lillian R. Gale in Motion Picture News, “As a spectacle, The Sheik is delightful, the photography exceptional. Indeed, it is unquestionably picturesque…Rather than a love tale, the picture is one of adventure, romance playing second in interest.” Exhibitors’ Trade Review agreed that there were plenty of thrills, saying “there is enough combat stuff, hair-breadth escapes and gallant rescues to please the most ardent lover of fervid melodrama.”\n\nAccording to Smithsonian Magazine, the famous backlash against Valentino and his movies came a bit later. At this moment, Ben Turpin was only having some silly fun, not making some kind of statement about supposed threats to American masculinity.\n\nLillian R.

She said she was in town to study filmmaking, and she knew exactly the sort of stories she wanted to tell:\n\n…the long-forgotten ones whom she will bring to life are the people who lived in the ancient Mexican civilizations whose relics now being exhumed in Mexico are making the world gasp with their revelations of art, science, and big human drama. These people are to come to life on the screen!\n\nWith the enterprise, backed by Mexican and American capital, even the lost city of Atlantis may come to life. Stirring stories of the Aztecs, the Toltecs, and last, but more important and vivid, stories of that mysterious civilization which built itself pyramids and cities and temples at Yucatan and other places, which now are being unearthed down there, are to live on the screen.\n\nOrlova had a point: there are still an awful lot of stories not set in Europe or the U.S. that could make great films. The Princess wasn’t wrong when she said, “Modern stories are pale beside the rich drama portrayed in the pictures and prehistoric writings found in these temples and pyramids. And you in the United States really have no idea what is being done down there in Mexico in the way of research work.”\n\nKingsley knew her readers, and she mentioned what they really cared about: “Princess Orlova is to engage her technical staff and most of her actors in this city.” However, she did warn that Orlova merely expected to “affiliate with one of the big companies soon.” Most of her audience would have known that ideas are nothing–if you don’t have the money, you don’t have a film production.\n\nYou won’t be surprised to learn that the Princess was a fraud. Kingsley, while staying polite, hinted that she didn’t take her seriously. She mentioned that Her Highness had no Russian accent, she was a “firm believer in reincarnation,” and the article opened with the silly line “And the princess waved her fairy wand and they all came back to life!”\n\nHappily, while Orlova was a great big liar, she was charming and fairly harmless. Unlike what she told Kingsley, she wasn’t born in Paris, her parents were not Scottish and French or named Marhanno. She did have a lot of different names in her 84 years. She started out as Clara May Russell and she was born in San Francisco, California on May 14, 1877. Her parents were William Henry and Nora Bowen Russell. Her father was born in Houlton, Maine (and lived in Carleton, New Brunswick, Canada) and her mother in St. John, New Brunswick. Clara had a younger brother, Hugh, and a younger sister, Gertrude. By 1900, they were all living in Oakland, California, and William Russell was working as a master mechanic for the Southern Pacific Railroad.\n\nShe married James H. Barry Fitzpatrick probably in late 1902 (the records haven’t been digitized yet). He was a theatrical manager. That same year she launched her career as dramatic reader, under the name Margaret Barry. She toured the United States, reading passages from works like Hugo’s Les Miserables, Materlick’s Monna Vanna, and Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, as well as selections from Shakespeare. They had a son, Russell Barry Fitzpatrick, on June 25, 1904 when they were in Hagerstown, Maryland. She told reporters that she’d been educated at UC Berkeley and did advanced work in Rome, Paris, and London, but I couldn’t find records to back any of that up. However, she did travel by ship from London to New York in 1909, so she might have actually done the series of readings in London reported on in the San Francisco Call in 1909. They said she won “many friends by her personal charm and ability.”\n\nIn 1910 she divorced Fitzpatrick. There were signs that it was acrimonious in the newspapers, but there was probably more to the story than got printed. In June of that year, after she’d been granted the divorce and custody of Russell, Fitzpatrick brought a suit to reopen the divorce proceedings, claiming she’d gotten the divorce and custody of their son through fraud, and one Charles A. Carver had been involved. Fitzpatrick hadn’t known the divorce had been granted (for cruelty and non-support) until he went to Buena Vista, Colorado, in order to “punish” the two.\n\nIn 1911 things got uglier. In May he accused her of threatening him with a gun if he didn’t return some letters. She then told the newspaper that she did visit but without a gun, to ask him to stop writing harassing letters to her father. She also claimed that Charles Carver was her stepbrother, and Fitzpatrick’s insinuations about their relationship were untrue.\n\nAfter that, the story disappeared from the papers, and so did J.H.B Fitzpatrick. According to their son’s 1919 passport application, he died in Ithaca, New York. Russell Fitzpatrick became a magazine writer. He married Dorothy Cavanaugh in 1932, and he served as a Warrant Officer in World War 2. He died in Sacramento on June 23, 1982.\n\nFitzpatrick had been right about her relationship with Carver, and she married him. Charles Andrews Carver was born on August 30, 1876 in Chicago. He’d been a noted athlete when he attended Yale. He was a Far Eastern agent for the Pearson Engineering Corporation, and the two travelled extensively. When they weren’t on the road, they lived in Manhattan.\n\nBarry continued her career in the theater. In 1910 she added ‘dancer’ to her resume when she played the title role in The Death of Eve by William Vaughn Moody in Alameda, California. The dance told Eve’s story after she decided to return to Paradise. She finds her son Cain who’d been banished to the desert and they travel to the tree of knowledge, where she dies. According to the San Francisco Call, “Mme. Barry’s art is that of a symbolic dancer, and her poetic readings add a touch that the emotional dancers fail to give.”\n\nShe toured with this piece, and In January 1911 Johannes Reimer reviewed her recital. He said,\n\nMargaret Barry’s performance yesterday at noon at the Stockton was one of finished art. Her tremendous personality spoke through it. It takes art to walk out on a bare platform without staging and costume and yet in her rendering of the first and last scene of The Death of Eve carry you far from time and place back into the very beginning of human tradition into the vitality of the pastoral days of humanity, among the fields and the herds of our most distant ancestry. For not this alone, but to awaken in you a feeling of the magnitude of the fundamental mother-love and its loveliness and the death of the one whom we in our fancy have depicted as the mother of all mothers.\n\nShe got to perform it in London in December 1913, at a recital at the Little Theater. The New York Clipper said, “her fine voice and artistic posing were much admired.”\n\nAlthough I haven’t found any travel records for them, she and Carver reportedly lived in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) for a time. In August 1917 Barry was in Los Angeles, lecturing on war conditions in Russia and raising money for refugee children and the Russian War Relief Fund. Two months later she appeared in several strange news stories spread by leaders of a Russian civilian relief organization that said she was to meet the deposed czar’s daughter Tatiana when her boat docked in San Francisco and escort her on her visit to the United States where she would either assist with relief efforts, look after her father’s investments or do a lecture tour (newspaper stories differed). They said Tatiana had escaped captivity via a sham marriage to a chamberlain’s son, which was supposed to have given her more freedom of movement around Russia. They claimed she took the opportunity to escape to Harbin in Manchuria, then to Japan, and she was on a steamship to the Pacific Coast. However, reporters asked steamship agents about the story, and they had no record of such a passenger. Furthermore, the Russian embassy knew nothing about it. Two days later Barry told reporters that she didn’t dare chaperone Miss Romanoff, because German spies were after her. With that, the story left the newspapers. It was all nonsense: at this time, the real Tatiana Romanoff was being held by Communist revolutionaries and she was executed along with the rest of her family in July 1918.\n\nBarry was living on West 78th Street in Manhattan in 1918, according to Carver’s draft registration. Her next world to conquer was the movies. In 1919 J. Stuart Blackton hired her to play Sylvia Breamer’s mother in The Moonshine Trail (1919), a melodrama about the evils of alcohol. In the May 17th announcement in Moving Picture World, she was called a Russian actress, because despite being born in California, she’d done most of her work there. They also mentioned that she’d appeared in some filmed legends for Pathe Freres in London. She went on to play small parts in other Blackton melodramas like Dawn (1919) and Respectable by Proxy (1920), but she didn’t get noticed by the critics.\n\nBy the January 10, 1920 Census she was living alone in Manhattan on East 57th Street, so apparently her second marriage had ended. She told the census taker she was widowed, but Carver was far from dead. He went on to marry a third time and move to Los Angeles where in 1940 he gave his profession as a “physical culturist.” He died in 1953.\n\nLater that year, she went on a trip around the world. On November 30th, she arrived in London from Port Said with a brand-new name: Margarite Orlova. According to the steamship record, she traveled with Vladimir and Nina Orlova, and she told the company that she was Russian, too. The Orlovas had a son named Nicholas who wasn’t on the boat; Margarite would later claim that he was a prince and she’d married him, then they moved to Vera Cruz, Mexico. I couldn’t find any records of that, but the visiting Mexico part wasn’t outlandishly impossible, unlike the rest of her story.\n\nShe next turned up in New York City in 1922 under her new name. She became a theatrical actress and had a role in a Broadway production, Drifting, from January to February. She told Kingsley that the writer, John Coulton, had written the part especially for her.\n\nThen one hundred years ago this month she had her interview with Kingsley. It’s no surprise that nothing came of her Mexican film ambitions. Her story helped fill up a column, then it was forgotten and life went on. Kingsley did include this snapshot of her in 1923:\n\n“She is a most interesting figure, is the Princess. A statuesque brunette, she has the most brilliant, yet the most kindly black eyes in the world. Her hair is bobbed, even if she does boast a grown son by a former marriage.”\n\nLater that year she tried to launch the Orlova School of Drama in Los Angeles, but it wasn’t a success. In September, she ran a bazaar in downtown Los Angeles selling Russian embroidery, posters, and paintings to benefit refugee Russian artists. She was also active with the Los Angeles Opera Club.\n\nSo she was keeping herself busy until September 1924 when L.A. Times writer Charles Sloan investigated, and her lies were laid bare. He opened his article with:\n\nThe most remarkable masquerade in the social annals of Southern California, possibly of anywhere, came to an end yesterday with the declaration by “Princess” Margarita Orlova, long a feted favorite of local society, that she isn’t really a princess at all and that the amazing history of her life, as told over the teacups to endow her with the glamoring romance of old-world royalty, is largely fictitious.\n\nSlone had decided to look into her background because she was mixed up in a scandal with the Los Angeles Opera Club involving “superhoaxer” Robert Walter Douglas (real name: Robert Andrews). She was a club trustee (a position that was planned to pay $5000 per year—annual club dues were from $25 to $1000) and had been the guest of honor at some of their club programs. Douglas was also the director of a home building company and he was arrested for embezzlement from that on August 8th, 1924.\n\nIt looks like the stories she was telling at social events were much wilder than what had gotten into the newspapers before. Slone wrote:\n\nInto the career of Mme. Orlova as it was gathered by those with whom she came in contact was woven all the glamor of Occident and Orient. She was labeled as a beauty who once had turned the heads of half the great men of Europe, as an actress whose artistry was internationally renowned, as a secret agent whose success was chronicled in many a diplomatic coup. But principally she has been famed as the wife of Prince Nicholas Orloff of Russia, as an intimate and protégé of the Czarina, as the heroine of thrilling exploits and sensational melodrama in the perilous days of Kerenskian revolution and the later advent of the internationalists.\n\nShe opens a studio; according to her own account she conceives and attempts to carry out a plan to restore the Russian throne to Grand Duke Nicholas. She tells thrilling stories of Dictaphones and secret service men and diplomatic escapades. Of intrigue after intrigue and scheme after scheme.\n\nAnd always grew the tale of her romantic past; growing into a veritable maze of drama, comedy, pathos and tragedy. In this the “Princess” seems to have perhaps unconsciously assisted. She spoke of famous personages to her intimates; she told them little personal anecdotes of them, and in these anecdotes she was always present. She did not deny the things she now says are untrue; she met them with silence and little piquant shrugs. Always a wonderful actress, she made wherever she might be a stage and played herself the stellar role: to her always the spotlight…the story of her achievements with which Los Angeles society has been regaled was greatly exaggerated and distorted into something it was not.\n\nAt least she was an entertaining party guest! Slone interviewed her in a little white-washed cabin in Laguna Beach, where she was working on a production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream for a small outdoor theater. She said that “she has never personally claimed to be a princess, and that never until now has she had an opportunity to publicly deny the romantic stories which have made her an international figure.”\n\nSlone then revealed what he’d learned from the City Prosecutor’s office about her real story. Some details are backed up by other records, like her birth in San Francisco and her two marriages. Others, like her being a protégé of Lord Kitchener and her nursing career at the hospital set up in the Winter Palace in Petrograd, there’s no other evidence for.\n\nSlone also followed up by gathering quotes from people who knew her, like the author of her Broadway play, John Coulton, who summed her up well, saying, “a charming woman, possessing great personality and love of intrigue—but born to be a stormy petrel in this whirl of life!”\n\nOrlova was never indicted in the Douglas case, so I don’t think she was a criminal. I suspect he took advantage of her ego, and she was as fooled by him as everybody else was. Slone concluded his article with a quote from her:\n\n“All that I ask in the future is a chance to earn my own living by my own ability and to have granted me the same kindness, the same chivalry, the same friendly and helping hand that Americans give one another in their daily life.”\n\nThat’s pretty much what she got — there’s no evidence that Slone’s expose ruined her life. Over the years, according to the social columns, she told wonderful stories about the royalty she knew, but she demoted herself to Countess if she claimed a title at all. She went on to have a pleasant and varied life with plenty of travel, still calling herself Margarita Orlova. She made her living by as an actress and public speaker. She appeared on Broadway again in 1926 in Coulton’s The Shanghai Gesture and was part of its touring company. The Billboard called it “an outright box-office play dealing with wholesale harlotry in an Oriental seaport.” She gave corporate speeches at banquets, and in 1930, spoke in Los Angeles schools on the history and psychology of make-up. In 1937, the list of her lecture topics was “Crashing Worlds,” “Wither Mankind,” “Sepulchers,” and “What Price America,” and she toured the United States with them.\n\nShe died on July 15, 1963 in Los Angeles.

Kingsley began her article by pointing out what a departure it would be for her:\n\nIf you expect to see the childhood of Marguerite, with Mary doing tricks with soapsuds on the front porch or kicking the mean old man who comes to collect the rent, why, you are going to be disappointed. Marguerite is beloved of the world and of the ages. Mary Pickford is beloved of the world, and is going to be beloved of the ages, or at least as many ages as her films will last…It was hard to imagine her, just for the moment, the broken-hearted Marguerite. However, I remembered what she did to us all in Stella Maris, and knew she was quite equal to the big artistic task before her.\n\nKingsley was pointing out the problem Pickford would have in transitioning to adult roles. Marguerite was to be in her first feature in which she played only an adult (not a dual part like when she played Little Lord Fauntleroy and his mother) and she’d hired a German director known for his sophistication, Ernst Lubitsch. During her visit, Kingsley saw him and the scenario writer, Edward Knoblock, by the gate, “walking along, consulting and gesticulating.” Pickford told her:\n\nThey always do that when they come to a knotty point in the story. You see I’m not really in the story yet. I’m to come in for consultation when it’s all over. He has been dreaming Faust all his life, and I can see nobody else making the picture. He seems a little perturbed over the fact that I have had so much to do with my own direction. ‘Will she get mad from me?’ he asked Doug the other day.\n\nOf course, that was precisely one of the reasons things eventually didn’t work out, but at this point, she was working harmoniously with Lubitsch. Before giving Kingsley her quite definite ideas about the character, she said it was all up to her director’s judgement. Nevertheless:\n\n“I think of Marguerite as just a sweet, innocent young girl of about 17 or 18. But I’m going to play her absolutely without any ‘cutes.’”\n\n“Well, I hope you won’t forget to be Mary Pickford,” I exclaimed.\n\n“Oh, I mean to forget everything I have done and learned,” said Mary quickly. “And oh, what an opportunity for emotional acting! I have never quite trusted myself in this sort of work, because though I am emotional inwardly, I am not so outwardly. As a child I played many emotional scenes. I loved to make people cry. I used to open one eye to see people cry when I died. I was rather a morbid child.”\n\nThat wasn’t quite how the Faust story was usually told. There had been countless adaptations of the German legend in novels, plays, paintings, poems, operas, and films. Faust was a necromancer who sold his soul to the devil (Mephistopheles) in exchange for knowledge and power. In the early versions, he was always damned for his ambition. Tales about him were first collected in Faustbuch (1587). The most famous version was a play by Goethe published in two parts in 1808 and 1832. He was the first to introduce the character of Margarete, nicknamed Gretchen, a pious young woman who is seduced by Faust, gets pregnant without benefit of clergy and kills the newborn baby. She is convicted of murder and is executed. Penitent, she’s forgiven, and she’s admitted to Heaven where she successfully seeks Faust’s salvation.\n\nPickford and her director were in agreement that their version would end the same way. She said: “Another problem is the matter of the ending of the story. Mr. Lubitsch desires the more or less ‘happy’ ending, in which Marguerite at last saves Faust’s soul.”\n\nThey hadn’t yet cast Faust (Conrad Nagle had been mentioned) or Mephistopheles, though her husband Douglas Fairbanks was rumored to want to play him. Pickford thought that would be a bad idea, because he’d make to role too attractive. Kingsley closed her article by saying, “a million dollars probably will be spent on Faust.”\n\nThey did spend quite a bit on developing the project, but it was never completed. The collaboration between Pickford and Lubitsch was first reported in the November 17th Film Daily, which said he was in negotiations with her to direct Dorothy Vernon, a story about love and political intrigue set in the Elizabethan era, even though he was under contract with Famous Players-Lasky. They also opined, “The working combination of Pickford and Lubitsch should result in a really great picture.”\n\nThe L.A. Times added more details on November 29th when they spoke to Pickford and Fairbanks when their train arrived in Los Angeles. They said that Lubitsch was going to direct one film each for Fairbanks and Pickford. The Fairbanks film was to be “a swashbuckling romance of pirate days, the theme of which he himself is not positive,” and Pickford still planned to make Dorothy Vernon.\n\nWhen Lubitsch and his wife, Leni Krause Lubitsch, arrived at the same station in late December, the Times article was called “Film Colony Prestige Increased.” When he got off the train, he told the reporter “I have come to America to learn American ways and to become American, not only in motion pictures, but in everything.” About his work, he only said it was “very possible and probable” that he was to be loaned by Famous Players-Lasky to Pickford for her next picture. A week later, Fairbanks clarified matters for the Times, saying that Lubitsch wasn’t under contract with Pickford, he was being borrowed and they still planned to make Dorothy Vernon. The article mentioned there had been rumors of opposition to Lubitsch among war veterans, but when the reporter interviewed ex-servicemen, including the national commander of the American Legion, he or she couldn’t find anybody opposing it.\n\nIn early January, Pickford announced a change of plans. She was deferring Dorothy Vernon until later that year and would make Faust. She said,\n\n“I have cherished the idea of playing the role of Marguerite for many years but I have never had the courage to consider doing it until the present. It so happens that now Faust turns out to also be a life-long dream of Ernst Lubitsch, that he has been studying the various legends for many years with a view of someday directing the picture and that he never has had the opportunity to do so. That was what decided me to undertake the picture now.”\n\nThat’s how things stood when Kingsley made her visit to the studio.* But only a few weeks later, on February 4th, the Times reported that “intimate friends of the star” told them that “in spite of the fact that immense sums of money have already been spent on preparatory work” Pickford had decided not to make the film. The reason given was “difficulties in the preparation of the script have been met, and it was found that Marguerite could not be made the star of the production without doing violence to the plot.” (that was a good point—both Faust and Mephistopheles were much more interesting and complex characters.) The Times writer speculated that Dorothy Vernon would be next, but it wasn’t certain, and Lubitsch would probably leave Pickford and go direct a film for Famous Players-Lasky, but nothing official had been announced.\n\nLater that month, Pickford did an interview with an occasional Times film contributor, Hallett Abend,** and she gave a different reason for the cancellation. She said, “I’m not an actress. I’m just a personality—a sort of an institution. That’s all the public will let me be.”\n\nThe Faust script, as Mr. Lubitsch and Edward Knoblock worked it out, was “wonderful, simple, and moving and strong,” she said with a wistful look in her face. “But Marguerite is too different from the kind of parts I’ve been doing for so long. The break from the girlish roles must come gradually just as Douglas has broken away from his old lighter, modern roles, only by degrees.” Abend also mentioned the speculation that was circulating at the time: “gossip has been to the effect that Lubitsch, with his decisive ways and his habit of making stars rather than meeting halfway the wishes of stars already renowned, had found Mary Pickford too unyielding, or had himself not been yielding enough to suit her wishes.” She denied that, quashing the rumors that Lubitsch was leaving.\n\nThe story got picked up by the trades, naturally, and they had slightly different versions of why Faust wouldn’t be her next movie. On February 21th, Film Daily said, “It is understood that a number of protests were registered from exhibitors and that these bore some weight in the final decision.” Exhibitors’ Trade Review said on March 17th that it was just delayed. They blamed the distributors for the wait, and quoted Pickford: “As a matter of fact, I have decided to merely postpone Faust. Each star, as you know, has her own special following and it seems best after careful analysis based on correspondence from those who are interested in my photoplays, as well as upon a survey made through our various exchange offices, not to step suddenly out of the type of story the public has been accustomed to associating me with into anything quite so dramatic as Faust.” By then, they were able to report that her next project would be Rosita, with Lubitsch directing, followed by Dorothy Vernon, with another director so Lubitsch could finish postproduction work.\n\nYears later, Mary Pickford told Kevin Brownlow why she abandoned Faust. It was that she was told she couldn’t change her persona so quickly, but it wasn’t the public, the exhibitors, or the distributors that stopped her: it was her mother, Charlotte Pickford. Mary Pickford said:\n\nWe were going to do Faust with Lubitsch supervising. But Mother didn’t know the story of Faust, so Lubitsch told her. “Ja,” he said, “she has a baby, and she’s not married, so she strangles the baby.” Mother said, “What? What was that?” “Well, Marguerite is not married, she has a baby, so she strangles the baby…”\n\n“Not my daughter!” said my mother, “no sir!”\n\nSo I didn’t make Faust.\n\nAnd that was that. Decades later, Kino Lorber released the test footage they shot. Called Marguerite and Faust: the lost 1923 footage, it’s part of their DVD of another version of Faust that did get made in 1926 in Germany by F.W. Murnau. His version wasn’t a financial success at the time, but it’s gotten more critical acclaim over the years. It was his last German film before he came to the United States and made Sunrise.\n\nPickford and Lubitsch did make her next film together, Rosita, a story about a poor singer in Seville who catches the eye of the king. You can find more about their sometimes acrimonious work together on the Pickford Foundation’s site. Mary Mallory has also written a detailed article about the film’s production and reception.\n\nPickford didn’t quite abandon the idea of making Faust; after she finished filming Rosita and Dorothy Vernon, she talked about her next project with Kingsley and said she was divided between making Romeo and Juliet and Faust. However, she admitted it was likely it would be neither, saying, “I was much interested in Faust, but Marguerite is by no means the central character, indeed she comes third in interest.” She was right: her next film wasn’t either, it was Little Annie Rooney (1925). She went back to playing girls, because her two ‘adult’ films didn’t make as much money as her movies usually did. Little Annie Rooney was one of the highest-grossing films of 1925. She was correct when she told Hallett Abend that the public only wanted to see her as a girl.\n\nOf course, things turned out just fine for Ernst Lubitsch in Hollywood. After the one film he made with Pickford, he only returned to Germany for visits. Film fans can’t be mad that she invited him here so he could go on to make The Marriage Circle (1924), and Trouble in Paradise (1932). Thank you, Mary Pickford!\n\nThis month, Kingsley also reported on Pickford’s husband’s proposed next project. Douglas Fairbanks planned to make a movie set in ancient Greece:\n\nWhether you feel, at first blush, that you can imagine Doug Fairbanks as a classic Greek or not, the fact remains that you are going to see him that way. We are going back further and further for our costume play themes. The latest announcement is that Fairbanks is to do a story, written by himself and Edward Knoblock, set in the times of Pericles. “The ancient Greek days offer a wonderful background for a picture,” declared Fairbanks, “and I am tremendously interested in appearing in a story of that period. Mr. Knoblock and I have outlined a story which I feel will be of interest to the public.”\n\nHowever, they didn’t get very far in working out this idea. His next film, which was co-written by Knoblock, was The Thief of Bagdad (1924). This was another example of Fairbanks chatting with a journalist much too soon about his plans.\n\nFairbanks and Pickford were such big stars at the time that Kingsley straight-up spied on them when she was supposed to be reviewing the vaudeville show at the Orpheum this month. Her article began:\n\nThe best part of the Orpheum show yesterday wasn’t on the bill. Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Edward Knoblock, Mrs. Charlotte Pickford and Ted Reed formed a party down in the third row at whom everyone was looking. Mary was a good little scout and applauded everything on sight, and Doug grinned all the time to show there was no hard feeling. Doug did pan once in a while though, making a noise like a regular critic, and Mary would turn right in and be what George Ade used to call a coffin-trimmer: “Well, I don’t care, Doug, she has a nice voice and pretty arms!\n\nSo that’s what an evening out with Hollywood royalty was like in 1923.\n\n“Abandons Faust,” Film Daily, February 21, 1923, p.1.\n\nHallett Abend, “Mary Pickford in Rosita,” Los Angeles Times, September 5, 1923.\n\nHallett Abend, “Won’t Permit Mary to Act,” Los Angeles Times, February 18, 1923.\n\nKevin Brownlow, The Parade’s Gone By, Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1968, p. 134.\n\n“Film Colony Prestige Increased,” Los Angeles Times, December 24, 1922.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Flashes: Trip in Sight Again,” Los Angeles Times, October 27, 1923.\n\n“Lubitsch-Pickford,” Film Daily, November 17, 1922, pp.1-2\n\n“Lubitsch to Direct Doug,” Los Angeles Times, November 29, 1922.\n\n“Mary Pickford Not to Produce Faust,” Motion Picture News, March 10, 1923, p. 1158.\n\n“Mary Pickford Ready for New Work,” Exhibitors’ Trade Review, March 17, 1923, p. 791.\n\n“Mary Pickford to Grow Up,” Los Angeles Times, January 5, 1923.\n\n“Mary Pickford to Begin New Picture,” Moving Picture World, March 17, 1923, p. 358.\n\n“Mary to Begin Work on Faust,” Exhibitors’ Trade Review, January 27, 1923, p. 443.\n\n“Pickford’s Faust a Challenge,” Los Angeles Times, January 9, 1923.\n\nFrederick James Smith, “Want Hamlet on the Screen,” Los Angeles Times, November 26, 1922.\n\n“Wonders If Earle Uses Any Actors,” Los Angeles Times, January 14, 1923.\n\n*Yet another version of Faust was in the planning stages in early 1923 by Ferdinand Earle, who was mostly known as an art director who in 1920 had directed one film that didn’t get released until 1925, A Lover’s Oath. He and Pickford had a little fight in the press about their respective versions. He said, “Mary Pickford’s challenge will afford the public opportunity to compare the best in old and new screen art. No more interesting experiment possible.”\n\nPickford responded in the L.A. Times: “Ferdinand Pinney Earle says, that in making Faust he ‘represents the new art’ while I ‘represent the old art,” said Mary indignantly. “How does he figure that out? I have Svend Gard, who put Johannes Kreisler on in New York, and who is an international reputation as an artist, and I have Irvin Martin to superintend the art end of the production. You know,” Mary smiled, just a wee bit sarcastically,” “I should think Mr. Earle would need actors as well as art in the making of Faust! I think Mr. Earle is a fine artist, and I admire his work, but I don’t understand his attitude. There is nothing either new or old in art.”\n\nEarle never did make Faust either, and he went back to being an art director. He worked on Ben Hur (1925).\n\n**Abend went on the become the Times city editor, and later the New York Times Far East correspondent. He was most famous for his books on China. In his early career he wrote film titles and read scenarios in Hollywood.\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, Grace Kingsley visited the Souls for Sale movie set. Based on his recent novel about Hollywood, the film’s director Rupert Hughes promised a lot:\n\n“When a person gets through looking at this picture, he will be qualified to do anything around a studio from being an actor to being a laboratory worker!” Rupert Hughes was kidding about his newest picture, Souls for Sale, and what he really meant was that the picture revealed the real studio life of the picture people.\n\nSouls for Sale will be a sort of two-ring circus. You who have been dying for a peep into a studio will have your chance, in addition to which you will get portraits of picture players as the actually are in real life, and also you will get a capital story.\n\nThe day she visited, they were busy shooting a King Arthur film-within-the-film. The leading man Frank Mayo gave her a bit of insider insight: he was wearing heavy armor, and he told her “It takes four men to hoist me onto a horse. When I want to alight, I just fall off.”\n\nBetween scenes she interviewed Hughes. The writer/director was happy to state his agenda: actors are just like other folks, or even a bit superior in terms of kindness, charity, and co-operation. He wanted to correct the public’s idea that Hollywood was a den of inequity, so reformers really had no need to fix it. He mentioned, “Lew Cody is the only really wicked person in the story—and he isn’t a picture actor in the tale!” He added:\n\nA lot of incidents in this picture really have happened either to my company or to that of other directors. For instance, take the accident with the wind-propeller which happens in this story. That really happened to Patsy Ruth Miller in Remembrance, when the night scenes were being taken at 4:30 in the morning when everybody was dead tired and shivering with cold, and somebody had moved the wind machine slightly, so that Miss Miller was within two feet of being struck by the thing, which would have inevitably killed her had she taken two steps more in the dark. Four people have lately been killed by those things, by the way, in the making of pictures. The dangers to the picture actor have never been exaggerated in fiction—in fact, they have never been really told.\n\nRupert Hughes was doing his bit to help defend Hollywood in the wake of the many recent scandals, such as the Arbuckle trial, the murder of William Desmond Taylor, and Wallace Reid’s drug addiction and death. Just like film fan turned reporter Ethel Sands, he loved the movies as they were. In the Los Angeles Times review of his 1922 novel which he was adapting to film, their critic vividly described just how much:\n\n“Rupert Hughes is an author, who, to use his own impressive description, ‘rifles his dictionary and guts his thesaurus.’ He is extravagant, bombastic, unrestrained. He has more energy than he knows what to do with. He tears a passion to tatters and then paints the tatters. He hurls himself and his theses at his readers in an unending series on onslaughts.”\n\nThe trouble with Mr. Hughes is that he is an evangelist. He cannot allow the world to remain longer outside the true faith—the Hughes faith. In this instance, it is the wonder and marvel, the magnificence and the munificence of the movies that is his theme. Those who dwell in outer darkness and find little beauty and or inspiration in the cinema are to him ignorant bigots, shutting their eyes to beauty and their souls to truth.\n\nBut with all his faults we love him still. He writes with a glow, an energy, a fervor, an impassioned belief in his own solution of life and life’s problems, that whirl the reader along and compel him to recognize the pure gold that lies buried beneath much dross.\n\nThe reviewer took the book on its own terms: she or he didn’t complain that it wasn’t important literature, they appreciated it for the lively trash it was.\n\nGrace Kingsley got to review Souls for Sale when it opened in early April, and she thought that Hughes managed to keep that same energy with his adaptation: “there is a snap and a dash and a power and a go about that world that is like nothing else on earth, I guess.” She also thought he succeeded with his aim to make the film business seem pretty wholesome:\n\nEverybody in the world apparently hungers and thirsts to know how the movies are made, and how the movie actors really look off-stage. Rupert Hughes let us have a private peep at some thirty-five stars in off-stage moments, lets us see the wheels go round in the films…Best of all it is done, this Souls for Sale, with the maximum of humanness, of humor, or romance, of thrill. Don’t imagine for a minute that the revelation of trade secrets is obvious stuff. It is all done as part of the story, and it is utterly engaging.\n\nShe summed up the plot: Eleanor Boardman played “the kissless bride of a villain who haunts her afterwards. She hops from the train on the desert to get away from him, and is picked up by a movie hero playing an Arab after the sub-title stating that ‘the usual sheik crosses the usual desert with the usual caravan…’ It is while the heroine is trying to get into the movies that the audience gets a peek at Charlie Chaplin and Von Stroheim directing, at various movie stars at work and at play.” She particularly admired those scenes: “It is a great big smashing bit of realism; it thrills you with romance; it makes you feel as if you actually knew all those stars.”\n\nNevertheless, she recognized that the plot about Lew Cody as the serial killer husband that Boardman escapes from was outlandish: “There is a good deal of the dear old hokum in the story, and one wonders, the story being so melodramatic, it the thing isn’t half a satire on the whole movie game. Anyhow, you’ll get a great kick out of this picture.”\n\nThe trade papers agreed with her about the creakiness of the plot, but they were unanimous: they all thought it would be a great big hit. Exhibitors’ Herald said, “here is a picture which promises to be one of the big money makers of the season.” Charles Sewall addressed exhibitors directly in Moving Picture World: “Here is a picture, Mr. Exhibitor, that will please and enthuse your patrons and cause you to smile broadly when you count up the receipts…Souls for Sale is an audience picture and a showman’s picture if there ever was one.” Screen Opinions was sure it would be a crowd-pleaser, even though it was “more or less a hodge podge of incidents connected with the making of moving pictures in and about Hollywood.”\n\nAnd they were correct. Souls for Sale was a huge box office success, one of the top earners of the 1922-23 season, along with Grandma’s Boy, Robin Hood and Blood and Sand. Just like everybody predicted, audiences did enjoy seeing behind the scenes. It was also helped by an impressive publicity campaign — Kingsley’s visit to the set was only a small part of it. No detail was neglected: they even collaborated with drug and department stores to advertise the film in shop windows:\n\nThere was one person the publicity didn’t work on: critic Robert Sherwood. In his collection of essays on the best films of the year, he said, “Souls for Sale was a highly dramatic story, designed to show what the frightful risks that movie stars must make for the sake of their art. It was all deadly serious, and it reeked with propaganda.” He thought it was much inferior to the other film about filmmaking that year, James Cruze’s Hollywood, which came out in August. Unfortunately, we can’t compare them: Hollywood is lost. However, Souls for Sale isn’t. It was restored in 2005 and it’s available on the Internet Archive.\n\nFritzi Kramer’s modern opinion of the restored version is closer to Sherwood’s than Kingsley’s; you can read her review on Movies Silently.\n\nThis month, Kingsley also had thoughts about a new trend in comedies in an article subtitled “Day by Day Our Comedies Are Growing Sadder.” She missed the good old gag-filled days, even though the new trend had produced some very good films like Chaplin’s The Kid. She wrote:\n\nDay by day, in every way, our comedians are getting gentler and gentler. Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd indeed are becoming regular tear chasers…Mack Sennett’s bathing girls are now bathing in tears! Phyllis Haver, Marie Prevost, Mary Thurman, all the lovely, joyous throng, have dry-cleaned their bathing suits and offered them to the poor.\n\nHow times have changed, indeed! The custard pies have retired from the garbage pail of art, one might say, to their rightful, dignified place in the pantry, and the last siphon bottle I heard of was taken to the museum along with the slap stick.\n\nOne of the best things about Kingsley’s writing is the respect she had for gags and the people who wrote them. She didn’t subscribe to the notion that drama was better than comedy, or that slapstick was vulgar. She reminded readers of one of her earlier trips to a studio:\n\nOne morning in the dim long ago of 1918 I went out to the Chaplin studio to find Charlie raging up and down the stage, teeth clenched and tears in his eyes as he wrinkled over a new gag that was just aborning. Nowadays he smiles as he tells you how, pretty soon, he is going to play the tragic Pagliacci!\n\nWe suspect now that Charlie is going to park his pants and his cane permanently and come out in his next picture wearing trousers and a fedora. Probably he won’t fall down once. We may as well face it. No more will Charlie stoop to pick up an imaginary fluid dollar. No more will his nether integuments cause him comic worry; no more will the suspense of his comedy depend partly on his suspenders.\n\nShe had a point: at that time Chaplin was directing A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama starring his former leading lady Edna Purviance. However, when it failed at the box office he went back to comedy (including some slapstick) with The Gold Rush (1925).\n\nShe had two theories why this was happening. Firstly, as Roscoe Arbuckle had told her in 1920, it’s easier to make a five-reel comedy-drama than two-reels of nonstop gags. Her other theory was that “the war is over now, and nobody has anything national to feel sad about.” That could have been part of it, but it also could have just been that audiences get bored and want to see new things. Plus she was right about all of the big stars moving into features, but producers like Hal Roach were still making two-reel gag-filled comedies.\n\n“Billy Sunday of the Movies,” Los Angeles Times, April 30, 1922.\n\n“Fate of a Pretty Girl Who Can’t Act: Hollywood,” Los Angeles Times, July 25, 1923.\n\n“Film Race is Run for High Stake,” Los Angeles Times, March 27, 1923.\n\nRupert Hughes, “Souls for Sale,” Exhibitors’ Herald, March 31, 1923, p. 32.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Flashes: Iliad of Movies,” Los Angeles Times, April 2, 1923.\n\nRobert Sherwood, The Best Moving Pictures of 1922-23, Boston: Small, Maynard & Company, 1923.\n\nCharles S.

He responds to the picturesque name of Tito Valentino, and is said to be singularly like his famous brother.\n\nTito Valentino will make his film debut in a Leslie T. Peacocke production called The Midnight Flower, an adaptation of a magazine story by Florence Herrington, well-known children’s welfare worker. The Peacocke production is being financed and presented by J. Price, Alaskan capitalist, and Gaston Glass and Vola Vale are playing the leading roles.\n\nTito Valentino did appear in Peacocke’s film, playing Juan Tarranza who is the actual robber, not Myra, a dancer known as The Midnight Flower, who is accused of his crime. While she’s in prison she gets reformed by a missionary and marries him. It’s a lost film.\n\nThe only thing wrong with this bit of publicity was that Rudolph Valentino only had one brother, Alberto Guglielmi, and in 1922 he was a physician in Italy (they also had a younger sister). Valentino was quite angry about it, and his denial came quickly. Newspapers reported how he delt with it in early January:\n\nA pretender to the Valentino throne is worrying the screen star, according to the New York Morning Telegram. The annoyance is of sufficient consequence to cause him to appeal to his lawyer, Arthur Butler Graham, 25 West Forty-third Street, to have it stopped.\n\nAntonio Muzii, residing on West One Hundred and Twelfth Street, is the cause of this additional trouble. He is 19 years old, a native of Italy, and claims to be the brother of Valentino.\n\nValentino is more than displeased. He went to the studios of the International Film Corporation, accompanied by his lawyer, to see Muzii, or Valentino as he was known to Mike Conley, casting director of Cosmopolitan Films, and from whom he obtained engagements in the films Adam and Eva and Enemies of Women.\n\nMuzii was questioned by Mr. Graham in the office of Mr. Conley. Mr. Conley held the attention of Mr. Valentino as the conversation progressed. Valentino registered deep displeasure, which intensified when he was informed that Muzii claimed relationship.\n\nIt resulted in Muzii losing his position, minor in character, also in the issuance of the following, signed ‘Rudolf Valentino:’\n\n‘I am informed that one Antonio Muzii of 500 West One Hundred and Twelfth Street, New York City, has been representing and holding himself out to be my brother. I write this letter to inform you that said Muzii is in no way related to me. You are requested to take no advertising given to you by any one in which the said Antonio Muzii is exploited under the name Valentino’\n\nThis notice was sent to various publications.\n\nThe statement was printed by several trade papers, including Exhibitors’ Herald, Film Daily, and Motion Picture News. It did the job—none of the ads for The Midnight Flower included Tito Valentino’s name, he was only in one cast list printed in the August 1924 Exhibitor’s Herald. They didn’t want to risk the star’s anger. However Valentino and his lawyer weren’t on firm legal ground: they could have tried suing people, but it probably wouldn’t have been worth the effort, since it’s not illegal to use another name professionally and actors lie about all sorts of things in their publicity.\n\nI so wanted to learn more about Antoinio Muzii, but I had no luck in searching the census and voter list databases using a variety of spellings, as well as his street address. Everyone who was even close to this name was much too old, and the only Anthony at 500 112th Street was a married 24-year-old paper company executive, Anthony Gaccione.\n\nI found a scrap of evidence that Muzii (or whatever his name was) didn’t stop trying. In the 1924 Los Angeles City Directory, there were three “photoplayers” listed under the Valentino name. It looks like it didn’t help his career–he wasn’t in any cast lists–and if Rudolph Valentino was annoyed about him again, it didn’t get into the press. Neither John nor Tito were in the next edition of the directory. I wish I could find out what happened to him next. He was young and had plenty of time for another career. Maybe he adopted another name and continued to try to break into film!\n\nRudolph Valentino was spending a lot of time with his lawyer in late 1922, dealing with a contract dispute with his studio, Famous-Players-Lasky. During that legal fight, he wasn’t allowed to appear in films so he was about to leave for an exhibition dance tour, which you can read about on Donna Hill’s Falcon’s Lair site.\n\nFilm writers wouldn’t have automatically discounted a story about a star’s siblings trying to get into the movies, because there were so many real ones, from Sydney Chaplin to Lottie Pickford. There were even other fake brothers — Valentino wasn’t the only one to be afflicted.\n\nBuster Keaton had a younger brother, Harry, and an imposter brother, Harry Keatan, who replaced the second A with an O when the confusion was helpful to his career, first as a comedian and later as the proprietor of dubious “film schools.” There’s no evidence that the Keaton family did anything but ignore him.\n\nIn 1919 he appeared in some shorts with the L-KO Kompany. The next year he had parts in more short comedies distributed by Universal. In 1923 Camera! reported that he had a part in a Bull Montana two-reeler Rob ‘em Good and that he had his own comedy unit at Century Studio. Camera’s last mention of him was in August 1923, when he was directing and starring in Circumstantial Evidence for Harry Keaton Productions.\n\nUnfortunately, Keaton Productions wasn’t what it seemed. Just a few days later he was arrested for battery. He was running a film make-up school that promised students jobs when they completed the course. One jobless pupil asked for his money back and got a punch in the nose instead. The L.A. Times said that he used the similarity of his name to Buster’s to lead people to believe he was affiliated with him. Once he got out of jail, he disappeared for several weeks and the State Labor Department couldn’t find him to press charges of operating an employment agency without a license.\n\nHe continued to be involved with sketchy film school ventures; in the 20’s he was arrested several times but after 1930 he stayed on the right side of the law. He ran a small studio where he gave acting lessons, and he appeared in a few low-budget films in the 1950’s, spelling his name “Keatan” in the credits. Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans might remember him as Jaffe from The Sinister Urge, part of Ed Wood’s distinctive body of work. He died on June 18, 1966, of a heart attack following a stroke.\n\nAntoinio Muzii:\n\n“New Pictures,” Exhibitors’ Herald, August 2, 1924, p. 227.\n\n“The Screen,” Indianapolis Star, January 6, 1923, p. 8.\n\n“Valentino Warns Against Alleged Imposter,” Motion Picture News, January 13, 1923, p. 173.\n\n“Warns Against ‘Brother’” Film Daily, January 2, 1923, p. 4.\n\n“The Week in News,” Exhibitors’ Herald, January 13, 1923, p. 38.\n\nHarry Keatan:\n\n“Love and Gasoline,” Moving Picture World, September 15, 1920, p. 25.\n\n“Seek Film School.

One of these serials deals with life in the Hollywood picture colony.\n\nThere’s a good reason you’ve never heard of her: Pascale had at most bit parts in movies. Nevertheless, her story is full of unexpected turns. You never know what might be hiding behind one of Kingsley’s short items!\n\nWhile her film career wasn’t remarkable, Diane Pascale was awfully good at self-promotion. She’d been in the L.A. Times before, in May 1921. They ran her photograph and a short interview with her before Queen of Sheba opened in Los Angeles, and she told them all about her adventurous past:\n\nWith life in European courts as the background of her youth, as well as stage training in the Conservatoire and at theaters in Paris, and later experience as spy in the service of France during the late war, Mme. Diane Pascale is proving one of the most interesting figures seen in the production of The Queen of Sheba, soon to show at Philharmonic Auditorium.\n\nShe said she was reared and educated in Paris and St. Petersburg, attended the Sorbonne, then worked as an interpreter and spy for France during the World War. She first saw American film studios when she was working on an important case for them in Los Angeles. She mentioned she’d had small roles in Enid Bennett, Louise Glaum and Nazimova films. It was much more publicity than might be expected for a role that didn’t appear in any cast listing.\n\nA month after Kingsley’s mention of her in December 1922, Pascale’s photo accompanied this terrific example of the promotional arts:\n\nDiane Pascale was recently chosen by a group of artists and oriental-art connoisseurs in New York as representing an unusually fine type of Far Eastern beauty. Miss Pascale posed for more than a hundred photographs, many of which will be used on magazine covers. She is well known in the Hollywood film colony both as an actress and writer. Several of her stories are in current numbers of popular magazines. Miss Pascale is of French parentage.\n\nUn-hunh, Asian art experts had nothing better to do with their time. The editors at the Times really needed a lot of stuff to fill up the paper! Nevertheless, in June 1923, Kingsley interviewed her when Pascale announced a new film venture. She filled in many more details of her colorful life.\n\nDiane Pascale is the latest entry into the realm of picture stars drafted from the ranks of cultured women—college bred, a writer accomplished in many lines of artistic endeavor including acting, dancing, and music. Miss Pascale has just signed a contract with Fred Caldwell to play leading roles in five feature pictures which he is about to produce.\n\nWith a brilliant background of professional training and cultured contact, with experience in life as a war worker, as a young society woman of this city, as a young wife and mother, the announcement of Miss Pascale’s film ventures will doubtless come as something of a sensation to those who know her merely socially.\n\nPascale said her French mother was a fine musician and a pupil of Franz Liszt. She decided to be an actress when she was a child living in Weisbaden where she visited backstage with the players. She and her mother moved to Switzerland where she was befriended by the Empress of Austria and a list of other nobles. Her American businessman father insisted that she go to college in the United States, so she was sent to Bryn Mawr. After that, “being young and romantic, she married, but ran away to go on the stage.” Then she “listened to the siren voice of a picture producer” and decided to come to Los Angeles. She had a bit part in a Fred Niblo picture, followed by several others, but she thought “I wasn’t progressing fast enough to suit me.” So she took the trip to New York that was mentioned the previous December. Kingsley added:\n\nMiss Pascale is a striking brunette, well-fitted to dramatic roles. She has a marvelously beautiful figure and has from time-to-time written articles for Physical Culture regarding the proper exercises, as well as the proper sports for women. “Don’t eat too much and don’t wear too many clothes; exercise and keep your mind alert!” This is the new star’s advice to women.\n\nThat isn’t the worst advice from an actress I’ve seen. Alas, the interview was the high point in her Hollywood career. Fred Caldwell never did produce five films featuring her; instead he was soon hired to direct short comedies that featured Alice Howell and Chester Conklin. Pascale has only one credit in the IMDB, a “minor role” in Rose of Paris (1924).\n\nHowever, her writing did appear in magazines. One piece had a Hollywood connection: her piece on screenwriter June Mathis was published in Metropolitan Magazine in November 1923. Her article in Vitality magazine about the horrors of eating in cafeterias, cabarets, and lunch counters was quoted at length in the L.A. Times that same month. She complained about noise and poor table manners of her fellow diners and blames them for dyspepsia and even “the deterioration of the American stage, the triviality of the American screen, the most asinine other kinds of amusements created and devised to relieve this poor tired business man of mental stress.” Nobody else saw that link! Her career as a magazine writer seems to have dried up soon after that, but she didn’t stop trying new things. In 1929 she copywrote an unpublished one-act play, The Passion of Salome, and in 1931, she copywrote a song, “Bayou gal, lovin’ me’s her specialty.” After that, she seems to have disappeared, yet another person thwarted in her artistic ambitions.\n\nLucky for me, she used her actual home address in her trade ads so I could find out that aspiring actress Diane Pascale was really named Elsie Amelia Wallace Moore, and she was the wife of a cement magnate, Aman Moore.* It’s remarkable how hard she worked to escape being ordinary and tried to make her acting aspirations come true.\n\nShe cherry-picked her own biography for the story of Diane Pascale. Elsie Wallace was born March 22, 1885 in New York City** to Jacob and Henriette Calm Wallace. Unlike what she told reporters, while her mother had a French first name, she was born in New York City too (her parents, John and Hannah Calm, were Bavarian immigrants). The Wallaces had two more children, William (1886) and Adrienne (1890). Jacob Wallace took the whole family along on a business trip and vacation to Europe in 1896, according to their passport applications, so at least she’d visited some of the places that she later claimed to be raised in. Then her family moved to Denver, Colorado where he was the vice president and general manager of Union Oil.\n\nElsie Wallace did attend Bryn Mawr and was in the class of 1907. Shortly after graduating, she married Aman Perry Moore in New York City. He had discovered a mountain of limestone, a key component of cement, near Croyden, Utah in 1904 and he was working for a cement company in Oregon. The couple moved West, and in 1909 he became the plant supervisor of the Oregon Portland Cement Company. They had a daughter, Elsa Adrienne, in 1912.\n\nElsie Wallace Moore became a writer. Her 1909 article “The Suffrage Question in the Far West” in The Arena is a good summation of the state of women’s voting rights at the time. She wrote an unpublished three-act play that she copywrote in 1912 called The Devil’s Slide, named after the small company town that sprung up by where her husband had discovered limestone.\n\nAman Moore died in 1935 following a heart attack in New York City. Later that year Elsie Moore had the contents of their house sold at auction, and she traveled the world. Unfortunately, in 1942 she was in the wrong place at the wrong time: she was one of the nearly 4000 civilians interned by the Japanese in Santo Tomas University in Manila, Philippines Islands, from 1942 to 1945. After she was released, she continued to travel; on an arriving airplane passenger list from Amsterdam to New York in 1950 she gave her occupation as “writer.” She died on September 6, 1965 in Manhatten.\n\n*Pascale also helpfully mentioned that her brother was named William K. Wallace, and he was working as a diplomat in Rome. His passport application agrees.\n\n**She was 36 when Kingsley interviewed her. That’s younger than springtime, of course, but an advanced age to break into acting.\n\nHarry Ellington Brook, “Care of the Body,” Los Angeles Times, November 11, 1923.\n\n“Chosen as Ideal Far Eastern Type,” Los Angeles Times, January 28, 1923.\n\n“Death of Mrs. Jacob Wallace in Denver,” The Landmark (Statesville, North Carolina), February 28, 1902.\n\nJeffrey Frank Jones, Japanese War Crimes and Related Topics: A Guide to Records at the National Archives.\n\nGrace Kingsley, “Exit Dolls; Enter Adults,” Los Angeles Times, June 3, 1923.\n\n“Parisian Star has Role in The Queen of Sheba,” Los Angeles Times, May 22, 1921.\n\n“Turkish Notable Give Turkish Party,” Camera, June 2, 1923, p. 9.\n\nElsie Wallace Moore, “The Suffrage Question in the Far West,” The Arena, July 1909, pp. 414-424."
