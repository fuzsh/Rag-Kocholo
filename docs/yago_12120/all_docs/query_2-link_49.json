(O’Rourke) Chamberland, a lifelong resident of Woburn, passed away peacefully on Monday, June 2nd, at the Daniels House Nursing Home in Reading. Born in Newton, she was the daughter of the late Peter and Mary (Flaherty) O’Rourke. Her family moved to Scituate for a brief time before making their home in Woburn’s South End, where Marguerite was raised along with her nine brothers and sisters. She was a graduate of St. Charles High School after which time she worked at Brigham’s in Winchester she met her future husband Walter.\n\nIn June of 1940, they were wed and honeymooned in the White Mountain Region of New Hampshire. Together they made their home in Woburn’s South End, where they raised their three children. Marguerite loved traveling with her family and friends, especially their Cape Cod vacations and their travels throughout New England and beyond, including bus trips. They enjoyed many close neighborhood friendships, especially their “card group” which met for over twenty-five years. Marguerite had many interests including gardening, swimming, bowling and reading. She particularly enjoyed novels and books in the area of psychology. Marguerite was also a gifted cook, baker and seamstress. She made dresses, coats, tote and book bags, upholstered her own furniture, made costumes for St. Charles CYO and delighted many with her beautiful afghans. Her artistic flare for decorating and creativity was apparent in everything she did. Holidays were celebrated at the family residence and Marguerite loved to cook and would cleverly improvise when she did not have all the ingredients for a particular recipe. One recipe that was always consistent was her datenut bread, which was “out of this world”\n\nDuring her sixties, Marguerite volunteered and took classes at Middlesex Community College, taught CCD at St. Agnes’s in Reading, volunteered at Barrows Elementary School, where her grandchildren attended school and worked at the Hitching Post in Reading. Her grandchildren affectionately called her “Grammie”; and their favorite activities were flying kites, fishing, bowling, tobogganing and baking Toll House cookies. Marguerite was also a member of the St. Charles Women’s Club.\n\nDuring Walter and Marguerite’s years together, working side by side, they carefully renovated their Eastern Avenue home. Marguerite continued to maintain their 100 year old home throughout her later years, meticulously cleaning the interior and caring for the exterior by cutting the grass, cultivating beautiful flowers and shoveling the snow during the winter.\n\nIn addition to her husband, Walter Chamberland, who passed away in 1962, Marguerite was predeceased by her siblings, Francis M., Peter, John and Paul O’Rourke, Catherine Regan, and Elsie Murphy.\n\nShe is lovingly survived by her children, Carolyn McGurn and her husband Louis Zampitella of Reading, Linda Erwin and her husband David of Reading and Rev. Joseph Chamberland and his wife Rev. Heidi Chamberland of CT, her sister, Helen Dooley of Winchester, her brothers, James O’Rourke and Thomas O’Rourke, both of Woburn, six grandchildren and four great grandchildren. A Funeral will be held from the Lynch- Cantillon Funeral Home, 263 Main Street, Woburn, on Thursday, June 5th, at 9 a.m. followed by a Funeral Mass in St. Charles Church, 280 Main Street, Woburn at 10, with Rev.
