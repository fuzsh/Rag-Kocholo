        "text": "Bradley - Joan R. Snow, 88, of Bradley, died peacefully at home on October 16, 2022, in the loving care of her adult children. Born April 5, 1934, in Old Town, she was the youngest of six children born of Arthur and Rosanna (Beaulieu) Ste. Marie.\n\nJoan grew up on French Island in Old Town, and attended high school at John Bapst High School in Bangor, graduating in 1952. On May 30, 1956, she married Ralph (Buzzy) W. Snow, the love of her life and enjoyed 59 years together until his passing on July 22, 2015. She loved being an Air Force wife as they traveled to where ever Buzzy was stationed. They first moved to Ellsworth AFB in Rapid City, South Dakota where Joan gave birth to their first child, Mary K. (Snow) Shorette. They then were assigned to Dow AFB in Bangor, ME and during this time, Joan gave birth to Ralph P. Snow and then to Diana L. Snow all between Buzzy's two tours in Vietnam. The family then moved to Loring AFB in Limestone, ME, where Joan gave birth to Carlene A. (Snow) Bilodeau. She continued to run the household through moves to Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal and Forbes AFB in Topeka, KS, until Buzzy's retirement in 1973 where they moved to the current family home in Bradley.\n\nJoan worked as an Avon representative until the children had all graduated high school. She then worked for a while at Doug's Shop n Save in Old Town, before going to work in the office of Dr. Michael Majka in Orono. She worked there until she retired in 1996. Joan and Buzzy enjoyed their retirement by traveling, visiting family all over the country and spending time with their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. As Joan was the matriarch of a large family, it was very important to her to maintain close ties to all of her extended family.\n\nJoan is survived by her daughter, Mary and husband, Joseph Shorette, of Bradley; her son, Ralph of West Monroe, LA; her daughter, Diana, of Bradley; and her daughter, Carlene and husband, Gary Bilodeau, of Dedham. She leaves four grandchildren, Christopher Shorette and his wife, Sarah, Heather Graffam, Philip Snow, and Brody Bilodeau, as well as four great-grandchildren, Alexi Shorette, Griffin Shorette, Noah Graffam, and Shiloh Crain. She is also survived by a very special nephew, Alan Cust, who was more like a brother to her, and his wife, Sue. She was also survived by an abundance of cousins, nieces and nephews, great-nieces and great-nephews, great, great nieces and nephews, as well as great, great, great nieces and nephews.\n\nShe was predeceased by her husband, Ralph W. Snow; her parents, Arthur and Rosanna Ste. Marie; her sisters, Marguerite and husband, Vernon Cust, and Loretta Sherwood; her brothers Raymond Ste. Marie and wife, Pat, Francis Ste. Marie and wife, Edie, and Paul Ste. Marie and wife, Anita.\n\nJoan was a very charitable giver, supporting countless charities. She faithfully attended St. Ann's Catholic Church in Bradley and was a member of the Ladies of St. Ann. She was active in the community and was not above taking a pie in the face if it was for a good cause. She set an excellent example of Jesus' love for all of her family as her children have often been told,\" Oh, I just love your Mom!\"\n\nHer family is grateful to St. Joseph's Hospice for their care and support in guiding them through her final days.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Joan's name to The Parish of the Resurrection of the Lord, 429 Main St., Old Town, ME 04468.\n\nFriends are invited to gather 3-8 p.m. Thursday, October 20, 2022, at Birmingham Funeral Home, 438 Main St., Old Town.
