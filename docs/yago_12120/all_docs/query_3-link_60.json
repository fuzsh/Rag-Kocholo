        "text": "Marguerite Wagner, 95, of Clarion, passed away Tuesday, November 7, 2023 at Clarion Wellness and Rehabilitation.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 11:00 AM on Wednesday, November 15, 2023 at Holmes Lutheran Church, 2139 Hancock Avenue, rural Clarion with Pastor George Lautner and Stan Watne officiating. Burial will be in Holmes Lutheran Church Cemetery.\n\nVisitation will be held from 9:30 AM – 11:00 AM prior to services on Wednesday at the church.\n\nThe family wishes are that memorials be made to St. Croix Hospice, but can be designated to any that you may choose in Marguerite’s memory.\n\nMarguerite Shirlyn Wagner was born December 11, 1927, to Oscar and Ellen (Anfinson) Egemo on their farm north of Holmes. Due to a snow storm the doctor could not make it, so her dad hitched up the horses to the bobsled and went five miles to get Aunt Sarah Wierson to help bring Marguerite into the world. Marguerite was baptized and confirmed at St. John’s Lutheran rural Kanawha. She graduated from Clarion High School.\n\nMarguerite lost her mother when she was 13 and then had to help her dad with her two younger brothers, Robert (died in 2020) and Charles (died in 2015). Her mother’s favorite Bible verse was Ephesians 4:32. Marguerite lived this every day. “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted forgiving one another, just as Christ forgave you”.\n\nOn June 7. 1946, she was united in marriage to Everett Wagner at the Little Brown Church. Their farming life began immediately. Everett had to cultivate corn the day after their wedding!\n\nThey always felt blessed with their family with their four children. Marcia Sundet (Bruce, Algona), Ed (Sherry, Dakota City), Jim (Webster City), and Monica Staudt (Pat, Clarion). Six grandsons came along and then the “greats”: Lillian, Chloe, Cora, Sasha, Faith, Laney, and Colin Sundet and Keegan and Paisley Staudt with two more Staudt babies in 2024! Marguerite couldn’t wait to share this “secret” with others. Marguerite and Everett had nearly 61 years of marriage.\n\nMarguerite loved to bake, but most of all, she loved to share! Kringla, butterhorn rolls, dipped chocolates, and blarney stones were among the favorites. And, of course, chocolate chip cookies that were always delivered to the six grandsons (Scott, Mark, and Stacy Sundet and Dan, Ryan, and Chris Staudt) in ice cream buckets!\n\nMarguerite loved being able to raise her family on the farm. From saving baby calves, feeding meals and lunches to farmers, gardening, and canning, and promoting beef through the Cowbelles organization Marguerite loved to visit with and judge future farmers with their bucket calves at the fair, and she even addressed a Washington DC congressional committee during the farm crisis in the 80’s. She kept busy always helping and encouraging all ages.\n\nFaith, friends, and community were special to Marguerite. She was active in Holmes Lutheran, with teaching Sunday school, participating in Home Circle, sewing circle, and even being the first female deacon. Marguerite belonged to Christian Women’s Club as well as multiple clubs for local women, including her neighborhood birthday club with longtime friends. Marguerite always enjoyed history and her memory was great! She spent hours organizing the history of Holmes Lutheran and helping the Holmes Cemetery Association when it was necessary to update information of all those buried in the cemetery. She loved getting to help with Monica’s Haiti mission trips by sewing more than 500 baby blankets.\n\nWhen Everett passed in 2007, she moved to The Meadows Senior Living apartments in Clarion. She was there for 16 years and belonged to the hospital auxiliary, and worked as a greeter at the hospital, and helped in the gift shops. She participated in all evening games at the Meadows and often set up for these. This past year she moved to the Meadows Assisted Living and then to Clarion Rehab and Wellness where she passed at noon Tuesday, November 7, 2023. The family is very thankful for St. Croix Hospice as well as family and friends for lots of love and support."
