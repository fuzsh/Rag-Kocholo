Felton Covered Bridge

Covered Bridge Road and Graham Hill Road

Felton

Built 1892

The Felton Covered Bridge is one of eleven covered bridges in California. Standing thirty-five feet high, it the tallest covered span in the United States. Because of its architectural rarity, it was recognized as California Historical Landmark #583 in July of 1969.

For forty-six years, the Felton Covered Bridge was the main wagon bridge for the transport of freight between the San Lorenzo Valley and the outside world.

In 1938, the bridge was destined for destruction and replacement by a new iron structure. The citizens of Felton protested in support of its preservation and the bridge was saved. The iron structure was placed farther down the San Lorenzo River and the Felton bridge was retired from use.

This action is said to be the first western example of preserving bypassed bridges. Although this was common in the East, the preservation of the Felton Bridge was a precedent for the western United States.

Today, the bridge is used only for foot traffic.
