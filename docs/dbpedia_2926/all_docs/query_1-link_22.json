        "text": "Palo Alto, CA - Today, Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Palo Alto) announced that Caltrans received a National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation grant from the Federal Highway Administration (FHA). Eshoo wrote to the FHA on June 30, 2011, urging their approval of the grant.\n\n\"Today's grant to Santa Cruz County to restore the Bridge in Felton will put people to work and restore a national historic landmark,\" said Rep. Eshoo. \"I'm thrilled for the community because the Federal Highway Administration grant speaks volumes about the importance of this historic bridge and the local community effort to restore it. I will continue to work with the community through the completion of this critical project.\"\n\nCaltrans has received $ 248,238 from the FHA to repair and restore the Felton Covered Bridge. The Felton Covered Bridge, built in 1892, crosses the San Lorenzo River just south of downtown Felton. This bridge is the tallest covered bridge in the United States, and is a local and national historic treasure, having been added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In 1982, severe winter storms damaged the bridge. The state and federal governments joined with the local community to fund the bridge's reconstruction, and in 1988, the project was awarded the National Historic Preservation Award for its craftsmanship, skill and efficiency.\n\nThe full letter of support is below:\n\nJune 30, 2011\n\nMr. Myint Lwin\n\nOffice of Bridge Technology\n\nFederal Highway Administration\n\n1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE\n\nWashington, DC 20590-0001\n\nDear Mr. Lwin,\n\nI write in strong support of the National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation grant for the County of Santa Cruz, California, to fund the restoration of the Felton Covered Bridge in Felton, California.\n\nThe Felton Covered Bridge, built in 1892, crosses the San Lorenzo River just south of downtown Felton. This bridge is the tallest covered bridge in the United States and in 1973 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1982, severe winter storms damaged the bridge. The state and federal governments joined with the local community to fund the reconstruction of the bridge, and in 1988, the project was awarded the National Historic Preservation Award for its craftsmanship and efficiency.\n\nThe Covered Bridge is again in need of repairs and the requested grant will provide funds for the County to repair this national treasure.\n\nThank you in advance for your attention to this important issue which I ask you to review and give your highest consideration. I look forward to your timely response.\n\n###"
