        "meta_description": "This concrete bridge over the San Lorenzo River on Graham Hill Road replaced the old Felton covered bridge in 1938. The new structure, designed by the office of Lloyd Bowman, is just over 220 feet long. WPA workers filled and graded the approaches to the bridge. A photo of the complete bridge appears in the Santa Cruz Sentinel on May 28, 1938.",
