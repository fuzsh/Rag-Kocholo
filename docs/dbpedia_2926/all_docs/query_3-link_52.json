        "text": "PARADISE PARK >> The California Powder Works Bridge, an engineering marvel located at the mouth of the San Lorenzo Valley, is now a National Historic Landmark.\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell designated the covered bridge Wednesday along with four other sites, including an Indiana house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, a 19th century reservoir in Massachusetts, the Lake Hotel in Yellowstone National Park and the modernist McGregor Memorial Conference Center in Detroit.\n\nThe new landmarks join more than 2,500 other sites as national landmarks.\n\nConstructed in 1872, the California Powder Works Bridge ranks among the most outstanding of nearly two dozen surviving examples of a Smith truss, a nationally noteworthy timber truss type developed by Robert W. Smith in Ohio. The design features a unique curved entrance overhang and diagonal truss web members that are light but strong, and its components could be inexpensively mass-produced at a factory and then shipped. For a while, its engineering allowed timber bridges to compete with iron bridges.\n\n“From a standpoint of engineering, they’re fascinating,” said Paul Loether, national register chief of the National Park Service. “When engineers were building these, they we’re pushing the edge of the envelope.”\n\nCovered bridges, which are inherently but not exclusively American, represent a period of achievement in civil engineering when the building of bridges progressed from a craft to a science.\n\nThe California Powder Works Bridge, however, is somewhat of a secret outside of the quaint Masonic Paradise Park cottage community where the crossing is deeply situated.\n\nIt is one of few remnants of Powder Works, established by entrepreneurs as an opportunity to replace East Coast supplies of gunpowder, which grew scarce during the Civil War, and to mine during the Gold Rush.\n\n“This mill was the first gunpowder manufacturer west of the Mississippi, but by 1865, other venture capitalists in San Francisco decided to make explosives as well,” said local historian Barry Brown, a Paradise Park resident who helped the bridge get designated. “Powder Works battled the big San Francisco firms for almost 50 years but was always the most lucrative and successful.”\n\nIn its San Lorenzo Valley location, Powder Works could harness river water and easily access shipping. A tiny town cropped up with about 75 buildings. During its 50 years of operation ending in 1914, the mill suffered from numerous explosions and fires that shook Santa Cruz, said Brown, who is working on a book about the mill.\n\nOnce used to shuttle loads of wood and charcoal, the covered bridge is now one of the only in California, still in regular operation by Paradise Park residents.\n\nThe bridge’s enhanced status is expected to help bring in more money for repairs and preservation (as well as traffic), Brown said. It was built by Pacific Bridge Co., which also constructed the famed Felton Covered Bridge. The Felton bridge is on the National Register of Historic Places and is considered the tallest covered bridge in the country."
