These architectural features came from “New Park,” the residence of James Pierce and later Judge Hiram Band, which had been demolished three years earlier to construct the Carmelite Monastery. Since Jack London was a friend of Judge Bond’s sons and visited “New Park” while he was writing “Call of the Wild,” popular myth says he wrote much of this book on this veranda.\n\nIn 1936 Alfred Brown modernized his home by completely updating the kitchen and two bathrooms.

And since it has an outside staircase leading to an upstairs garret, not unlike Vancouver’s description of the Indian ‘apartments’ of 1792, the structure may in fact have been constructed earlier than is generally supposed.”\n\nThe Berryessa Adobe has changed ownership a multitude of times over the past two centuries. It was first sold to Maria Zacharias Bernal y Berryessa.\n\nBerryessa then gave the home to her son, Fernando, who was later killed in San Rafael on the order of John Charles Frémont during the Bear Flag Revolt.\n\nIn 1970, a historical marker was placed by the Berryessa Adobe.\n\nIn 2002, the adobe was dedicated as a musuem with descendants of the families who once lived in the structure present. The musuem consists of the histories of the families that once lived there.\n\nThe Mission Period In The Santa Clara Valley\n\nIn 1769, Ohlone Indians first encountered Spanish travelers in the bay area. A few years later, on January 12, 1777, Mission Santa Clara de Asis became the eighth of the Catholic California missions founded in California.\n\nThe plaques associated with “Stroll into the Past”, next to the the Santa Clara City Hall Building, where part of the city’s 150th anniversary celebration in 2002."
