The county owns other nearby property with parking access that are far better suited and would not undo the historic protections for the covered bridge this community worked so hard to ensure.\n\nMost SLV residents do not have flat open expanses of lawn, and the Felton Town Plan and park plan recognized that, and intended for the park officially titled \"Felton Commons\" to serve as lawn and gathering space for all Felton and SLV residents. Imagine if we allow special interest projects like this to take chunks of the open space. Soon, it will be gone.\n\nOurs is one of only a few covered bridges left in the state. Located at a critical intersection it's the site of many community events and our only highly-visible and public gathering places. It's an important jewel in the community offering much more than a playground or picnic spot. It's the icon our community identity and Santa Cruz Mountains history and culture."
