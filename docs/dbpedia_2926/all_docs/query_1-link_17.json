The bridge was the only access to Felton until the 1930s.  The Felton Bridge, one of the last remaining covered bridges built of Redwood, is only 24m long but is 10m high, the tallest covered bridge in the United States.  It is unknown why the bridge has such an elevated roof.\n\tFelton, California",
