        "text": "Built in 1892 for $4,677, the Felton Covered Bridge is one of only 11 covered bridges still remaining in California. Because of its architectural rarity and because it has the distinction of being the tallest covered span in the United States (standing 35 feet high). The Felton Bridge has been recognized by the state as Historical Landmark #583 since July 1969.\n\nFor 46 years, it faithfully served as the San Lorenzo Valley's link to the marketplaces of the world for it was used as the valley's main wagon bridge for the transport of freight. In 1938, due to its deteriorating condition, the bridge was destined for destruction and replacement by a new iron structure; however, the citizens of Felton protested in support of its preservation and the bridge was saved. The iron structure was placed farther down the San Lorenzo and the Felton bridge was retired from use. This action is said to be the first Western example of preserving by-passed bridges. Although this was a common occurrence in the East, the preservation of the Felton Bridge was a precedent for the Western United States.\n\nToday, the bridge is used only for foot traffic. Although the bridge has been damaged by bad weather and floods, it has been repaired and maintained by the Felton Volunteer Fire Department since 1959. Using the funds raised from their annual pancake breakfast held on the bridge, the Fire Department has already replaced the missing north wall. Today, they continue in their preservation work.\n\nBridge Description\n\nBuilt in 1892, this bridge is one of only 11 covered bridges still remaining in the state. Its design is a mixture of the Pratt-Warren truss construction with diagonals of iron and compression members of vertical timbers. With its construction of local redwoods, it is proposed to be the last of the redwood spans. (redwood was still used for siding and rails on subsequent bridges).\n\nMeasuring approximately 10 feet in length and 35 feet in height, it is the tallest covered span in the United States. For 6 years, the Felton Bridge served as the San Lorenzo Valley's link to the outside world, for it was used by wagons in hauling freight between Felton and Graham Hill Road. Its use as a wagon bridge was discontinued in 1938 when a nearby iron bridge assumed its functions. After that time, it fell into disrepair with the wood suffering from alternate wetting and drying.\n\nOver the years, the boards on the north end of the bridge have disappeared and paired windows which were found on both sides only remain on the south side. The bridge was especially damaged by the floodwaters of 1955. Since 1959, the bridge has been maintained by the Felton Volunteer Fire Department. Using funds gained from their annual pancake breakfast, the Felton firemen replaced the north wall in 1960.\n\nNow, the bridge is used only for foot traffic, but it still remains one of California's last relics of the bygone era of covered bridges."
