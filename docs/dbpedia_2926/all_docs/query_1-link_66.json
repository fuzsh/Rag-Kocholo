        "text": "The world is full of amazing places to visit, and fortunately for us, many of them are right here in the United States. Perhaps your travel bucket list includes places to see fall foliage, the most romantic spots in America, or the best Christmas towns. But if your idea of the perfect vacation involves a mix of charm and history, then consider visiting one of the most beautiful covered bridges in the U.S. While there were once thousands of covered bridges across the country, there are only 500 to 600 remaining today. We rounded up some of the most famous covered bridges in America that are sure to take your breath away.\n\nHogback Covered Bridge: Madison County, Iowa\n\nYou've heard of the famous romance novel and film The Bridges of Madison County. Well, here's one of the most famous ones! This historic bridge is one of six remaining out of the county's original 19. Built in 1884 and rehabilitated in 1992, it features a lattice truss design and is painted a beautiful, vibrant shade of red.\n\nNewfield Covered Bridge: Newfield, New York\n\nThe oldest of 33 covered bridges in New York state, Newfield Covered Bridge is located in the Finger Lakes wine region, which makes it the perfect photo pitstop to explore while you're touring the local wineries!\n\nFlume Covered Bridge: Franconia Notch State Park, New Hampshire\n\nCalling all hikers! This picturesque bridge is nestled in Franconia Notch State Park at the start of the Flume Gorge Loop. Stop here for a charming photo op before you explore the scenic waterfalls, gorge, and streams along the trail.\n\nFelton Covered Bridge: Felton, California\n\nMeet the tallest covered bridge in the United States! Approximately 35 feet high and 80 feet long, this bridge crosses the San Lorenzo River and is accessible to anyone visiting Felton Covered Bridge Park. You won't be able to drive on it but you can walk through it and take pretty photos!\n\nCampbell's Covered Bridge: Landrum, South Carolina\n\nBuilt in 1909, Campbell's Covered Bridge is the last remaining covered bridge in South Carolina. It's located in a serene 18.65 acre park where visitors can picnic, explore an old grist mill and home, and dip their toes in the creek.\n\nStark Covered Bridge: Stark, New Hampshire\n\nThis wooden covered bridge stretches across the Upper Ammonoosuc River in Stark, New Hampshire and is widely known as the most photographed bridge in the state. It's quite the idyllic sight, especially since it's complemented by a nearby historic church that dates back to 1853.\n\nCornish-Windsor Covered Bridge: Cornish, New Hampshire\n\nThis stunning bridge connects the towns of Cornish, New Hampshire and Windsor, Vermont across the Connecticut River. It's famous for being the longest wood bridge in the U.S. and the longest two-span covered bridge in the world.\n\nGoodpasture Covered Bridge: Lane County, Oregon\n\nOregon's second-longest covered bridge is also one of its most photographed—and it's easy to see why. Spanning the scenic McKenzie River, this bridge boasts a beautiful setting and distinctive architectural detailing.\n\nHenniker Covered Bridge: Henniker, New Hampshire\n\nIf you're looking to visit a bridge with a backdrop of beautiful fall foliage, look no further than Henniker Covered Bridge. This one was built much more recently than the others on our list, in 1972, but it was constructed using traditional methods and materials: The town lattice truss structure was even pulled into place by oxen!\n\nHorton Mill Covered Bridge: Blount County, Alabama\n\nBuilt in 1934, the Horton Mill Covered Bridge towers 70 feet above the Calvert Prong of Little Warrior River. In fact, it's known for being the highest covered bridge above a U.S. waterway! It's one of three covered bridges in Blount County, which has been dubbed the \"Covered Bridge Capital of Alabama.\"\n\nBridgeport Covered Bridge: Nevada County, California\n\nThis historic bridge has the longest clear span of any covered bridge in the nation. Built in 1862, Bridgeport Covered Bridge reopened to pedestrians in November 2021 after a decade-long restoration project.\n\nHumpback Covered Bridge: Alleghany County, Virginia\n\nHumpback Bridge spans across Dunlap Creek and is Virginia's oldest remaining covered bridge, as well as the only covered, humpback bridge remaining in the United States. Part of a five-acre wayside park, this spot is a favorite of locals.\n\nHyde Hall Covered Bridge: Springfield, New York\n\nHyde Hall Covered Bridge is believed to be the oldest remaining covered bridge not only in New York but in the entire nation. Built in 1825 on the then-private property of country mansion Hyde Hall, both historical sites are now a part of Glimmerglass State Park, which also boasts a popular beach and miles of great trails.\n\nPortland Mills Bridge: Parke County, Indiana\n\nBuilt in 1856, Portland Mills Bridge is the second oldest of 31 historic covered bridges in Parke County. If you really have you heart set on seeing as many of these charming structures as possible, this is the county to hit!\n\nWawona Covered Bridge: Yosemite National Park, California\n\nPlanning a visit to Yosemite National Park?
