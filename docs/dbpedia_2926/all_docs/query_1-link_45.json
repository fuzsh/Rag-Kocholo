        "text": "On Tuesday, 12/12/23, the Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors voted to move forward with the proposed pump track at Felton’s Covered Bridge County Park.\n\nThis means that we’re officially one step closer to building the new track!\n\nThe meeting approved a working agreement between the SCMTS team and Santa Cruz County Parks and gave the County Parks Director the authority to approve the track’s final design.\n\nThis decision will enable us to move through the final design process more quickly, and begin on track construction as soon as next year. Thank you to everyone who spoke up in support of the pump track.\n\nWhether you commented on the agenda item, emailed the Board of Supervisors directly, or attended today’s meeting, you were an important part of the success we saw today. We’re proud to have such a supportive community!\n\nUp next: we’ll fine-tune the track’s design with the County Parks Director, and begin to pull together construction details so that we can begin fundraising for this project. Stay tuned for more from our team in the months ahead!\n\nA pump track is a series of rollers, jumps, and banked turns that connect in a closed loop. They’re popular across all age groups, and over 100,000 trips are made to existing pump tracks in the City of Santa Cruz each year.\n\nThe proposed track would take the place of an unused volleyball court in Covered Bridge County Park. It would bring new outdoor recreation opportunities to the area, and be the only resource of its kind in the San Lorenzo Valley.\n\nThe Santa Cruz Mountain Trails Stewardship in partnership with County Park Friends propose building a pump track at Felton Covered Bridge Park. The San Lorenzo Valley has a deficit of parks and other recreational amenities compared to other areas of San Cruz County. A pump track would be a great addition as it will provide a recreational experience to a diverse range of users of all ages.\n\nA pump track is a track for wheeled sports equipment that, when ridden properly, does not require pedaling or pushing, but a “pumping” action to maintain momentum. pump tracks can be constructed out of different materials. Dirt is the traditional surfacing, but, the use of asphalt surfacing minimizes maintenance needs and allows for other wheeled users such as skateboards, scooters, roller skates etc., in addition to bicycles. pump tracks can be utilized by people of all ages and skill levels and allow for skills progression.\n\nSeveral examples of pump track can be seen in the county. Ramsay Park, Harvey West Park, the Westside Pump Track, Skypark, McGregor Park and Chanticleer Park all have pump track facilities. Notably absent from this list is any park in the San Lorenzo Valley. Felton Covered Bridge Park would provide the perfect location for a pump track, sitting at the intersection of major transportation routes in and out of the San Lorenzo Valley.\n\nPlease note: The closest existing pump track is at Skypark in Scotts Valley. This pump track is temporary. It will be demolished to make way for new housing development in the area.\n\nThe proposed pump track will reduce the usable lawn space interior of the walking path and west of the volleyball court by 13% (6,500 sf of approximately 50,000 sf of lawn). This is mostly the margins between existing volleyball court and path. This will still provide space for community events while reducing the watering and mowing requirements of the turf."
