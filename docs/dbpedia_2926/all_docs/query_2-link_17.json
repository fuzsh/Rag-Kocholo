        "text": "Two back-to-back Dead & Company concerts at Shoreline Amphitheater meant that we had time during the day before the shows to do some exploring!\n\nLast year when in town for Dead & Company’s summer tour stops at Shoreline, we also visited the NASA Ames Exploration Center, Mission Santa Clara de Asis, the Computer History Museum, and the Tech Museum Of Innovation, as well as Hoover Tower, and the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden at Standford University. This year we did stop by the Intel Museum to learn about computer chips and the company’s history, but we wanted to get out of the city too, so we decided to head into the Santa Cruz Mountains to see some giant redwoods.\n\nOn our way to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park and Roaring Camp Railroads, we drove by a beautiful and very tall wooden, covered bridge in the city of Felton, California. Now, Brian knows that I can’t see something like that and not get a closer look, so on our way back out of town, we stopped to check it out.\n\nThe Felton Covered Bridge, spanning the San Lorenzo River, is considered to be the tallest covered bridge in the United States.\n\nDesigned by Pratt Warren and built in 1892, the historic bridge uses a brown truss structural system and measures approximately 80 feet long and 35 feet tall. For 45 years, the bridge was main entry point for the town of Felton, but eventually became a pedestrian bridge when roads were needed to accommodate more travelers and vehicles.\n\nIn 1957, the Felton Covered Bridge was designated a California Historical Landmark and in 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. After sustaining damage from winter storms in 1982, the bridge underwent a major restoration in 1987.\n\nToday you can visit the Felton Covered Bridge and walk through it at the Felton Covered Bridge Park that was built around the bridge. The park has a playground, a sand volleyball court, a large grassy area, and a picnic area — and with the right license, you can go fishing too!\n\nIf you’re in the area, a quick stop and walk through this old bridge is definitely worth your time.\n\nKnow Before You Go"
