Some of them are no longer around, like the 530 feet long Soquel Avenue Covered Bridge (built in 1874) that crossed over the San Lorenzo River, and the 83 feet long Glen Canyon Road Covered Bridge (built in 1892) that crossed over Branciforte Creek. They were replaced with a more modern concrete bridge.\n\n\"Felton Covered Bridge\", \"37.050775\", \"-122.070926\"\n\nAt 163 feet long, this Pratt truss design bridge was built in 1892, it's believed to be the tallest covered bridge in the U.S. It is listed as a historic landmark under the National Register of Historic Places #73000451, and California Historical Landmark #583.\n\nAlso see: Felton Covered Bridge Park\n\n\"Glen Canyon Covered Bridge\", \"36.99923\", \"-122.009432\"\n\nThis bridge was built in 1892, but was later moved to\n\nDeLaveaga Park in 1939 and a concrete bridge was built in it's place.

This bridge became a national landmark in 2015.\n\n\"Lompico Covered Bridge\", \"37.050775\", \"-122.070926\"\n\nThis footbridge connects the road to the private home on the other side of Lompico Creek.\n\nâ€¢ The following bridges were built as more of a tourist attraction:\n\n\"Redwood Village Covered Bridge\", \"36.975826\", \"-121.886632\"\n\nThe 88 feet long Redwood Village Covered Bridge crosses a branch of Valencia Creek. It was not covered when it was originally built in 1974, but a roof was added to add \"charm\" to the village bridge.\n\n\"Roaring Camp Covered Bridge\", \"37.042786\", \"-122.06319\"\n\nThe Roaring Camp Covered Bridge is a 36 feet long Pratt truss design bridge that crosses over Roaring Camp Gulch & Pond.
