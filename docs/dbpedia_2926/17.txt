Stop by the Felton Covered Bridge Park and marvel at a California State Historical Landmark. Built in 1892, the Felton Covered Bridge is one of the few covered bridges remaining in the state. There is a nearby playground and a wide grassy expanse with a walking path perfect for pets. This location is less than half a mile from Roaring Camp Railroads, so it could be a great addition to a Felton historical tour!
