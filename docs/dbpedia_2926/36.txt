The Felton Covered Bridge in Felton, California

Initially built in 1892 as the main access point into Felton, the Felton Covered Bridge is merely used nowadays for pedestrian traffic. But it doesn’t make it any less beautiful.

It extends 80 feet across the San Lorenzo River and rises at a whopping 35 feet tall, making it the country’s tallest surviving historic covered bridge. This one is yet another bridge reportedly haunted. Apparently, it’s by the ghost of a woman killed, accused of being a witch.

Fun Fact: The Cornish-Windsor Bridge, connecting New Hampshire to Vermont, is the longest wooden bridge in the nation, at 449 feet.
