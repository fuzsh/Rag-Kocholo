        "text": "The undergraduate outcomes for our students don’t lie. When you leave Babson, you emerge as a top candidate in the eyes of employers from all areas of today’s global economy. This is thanks to the strong business foundations, hands-on projects, institutional support and resources, and real-world experience you will have under your belt.\n\nOur Undergraduate ROI Numbers Don’t Lie\n\nBut, don’t take our word for it. The success of our over 44,000 alumni speaks for itself. The Class of 2023 undergraduate employment stats, not to mention the average starting salary for our college graduates, show just how ahead of the pack our students are.\n\nAdditionally, we pride ourselves on having one of the highest graduation and retention rates in higher education. Our four- and six-year undergraduate graduation rates (94%) and undergraduate first-to-second year retention rate (95%) are higher than the reported national average (62%) from the National Student Clearinghouse. These numbers are a testament to our curriculum, extracurricular opportunities, and resources for physical and mental health, as well as career success.\n\nA Degree That Takes You Anywhere\n\nOur students do it all, across industries and disciplines. You will find our alums as owners of their own financial businesses, as accountants for non-profits, as supply chain analysts for the fashion industry, and as project managers at agencies and large corporations (to name a few!).\n\nBelow is just a sampling of where our graduates have landed.\n\nThe Lessons You Learn Here Last a Lifetime\n\nIt doesn’t matter what industries graduates are working in or where you want to go. Whatever your next step is, your entrepreneurial leadership mindset will get you there. Our curriculum, with its unique blend of business and liberal arts and sciences courses and more than 20 concentrations to choose from, prepares our students to be the critical thinkers and thought-starters the future needs and employers want. And, our Hoffman Family Undergraduate Center for Career Development (CCD) team and resources are here to support and help connect you to internships and externships, professional networks, and employment opportunities to enhance that experience."
