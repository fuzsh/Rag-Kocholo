If you’re only planning on staying for a few hours in a city, why pay for an entire day as you would with other luggage storage services?\n\nSantiago Bernabéu Stadium\n\nSantiago Bernabéu stadium locates in the capital of Spain, Madrid. It is the home ground for a well-known football team Real Madrid and at the same time, it is the second largest stadium in Spain. The stadium was named after the president of Real Madrid, who was president from 1943 to 1978. Several important football matches have been hosted here, such as the European Cup, the UEFA Champions League, and the Copa Libertadores.\n\nBefore heading to a football match, look at the stadium’s bag and security policy to avoid unnecessary complications.\n\nWhat you can and cannot bring inside Santiago Bernabéu\n\nThere are no cloakrooms at the stadium.\n\nAllowed bags:\n\nThere is not an official bag policy for the stadium but be aware that bags are checked before entering the stadium and the smaller bag is, the better.\n\nProhibited items:\n\nno food or drinks in metal packaging, glass, ceramics or wood that is over 500ml\n\nalcoholic beverages, narcotics, psychoactive drugs, stimulants\n\nstrollers\n\nweapons\n\nflares, fireworks\n\nIt is not possible to leave and re-enter the stadium, so make sure to store your luggage safely with LuggageHero near the stadium and go have fun!\n\nLuggageHero can store your belongings close to Santiago Bernabéu\n\nAt LuggageHero, we offer secure and cheap luggage storage just near this stadium. All our shops are certified by LuggageHero.\n\nDrop off your bags by using LuggageHero’s network of local shops and hotels located in Madrid.\n\nHalf price compared to station lockers and airport lockers\n\nLuggage lockers, also called city lockers, are generally at least double as expensive daily compared to LuggageHero’s luggage storage service. Until recently, travelers could only stow their bags in these luggage lockers, offering little flexibility regarding pricing, where to go, and luggage deposit.\n\nAlso, LuggageHero offers stores in countless places so that you always have the option of dropping off your luggage in a safe environment. Unlike luggage lockers in stations and airports, LuggageHero offers both hourly and daily rates. LuggageHero strives to offer flexible and cheap luggage storage near you at all times.\n\nWe store all kinds of luggage – any size and any shape in verified stores\n\nLuggageHero’s users can store luggage of any size and/or shape in our storage locations. It doesn’t matter if it is ski equipment, photo equipment, or backpacks.

LuggageHero’s customers can choose to be charged by the hour or our daily rate, regardless of what they store.\n\nLuggageHero redefines convenience for travelers. Take advantage of our generous baggage allowance and leave your luggage and carry-on bags in our secure, innovative, and environmentally friendly locker storage. You can easily bounce into our store and embark on adventures unburdened by heavy luggage!\n\nWe can stow your luggage for several days\n\nLuggageHero also provides multi-day storage because flexibility is essential when traveling.\n\nLuggageHero offers a lower daily rate when you store your luggage for longer.
