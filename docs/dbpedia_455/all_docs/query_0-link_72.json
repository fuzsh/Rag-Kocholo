        "text": "Despite being the home team, Madrid will be wearing their fourth kit for the first time when Athletic Club visit the BernabÃ©u.\n\nReal Madrid play host to Athletic Club as LaLiga hits Week 30. The leaders, who could go eight points clear at the top of the table, won;t be wearing their traditional all-white kit against the BilbaÃ­nos. Ancelottiâs team will take to the pitch wearing their brand new, all-purple kit for the first time. The teamâs fourth kit (this seasonâs second strip is navy and the third, black) forms part of Adidasâ Y-3 range, the creation of Japanese designer, Yohji Yamamoto. Purple is at the fore once again, being one of the clubâs traditional colors. The new range will be worn by both the menâs and womenâs teamsÂ this season.\n\nDuring the late 70s/early 80s, the club recovered the color purple which replaced the royal blue used for the teamâs away kits. Castilla wore all purple when they faced Madridâs first team in the 1980 Copa del Rey final at the BernabÃ©u. Purple stripes and detailing also appeared on the white home kit from the 1980s onwards. Since then, Madrid have used various shades of purple is their second and third strips - memorably in 1997/98 and 2016/17 while last seasonâs away kit was lilac with black trimmings.\n\nYamamotoâs Madrid designs\n\nDetails of the newÂ Y-3 kitÂ were published at the start of last week via the clubâs different social media platforms (Real Madrid, Adidas, and Y-3).Â Jude BellinghamÂ andÂ David AlabaÂ from the menâs team andÂ Misa RodrÃ­guez,Â Naomie FellerÂ andÂ Kathellen SousaÂ from the womenâs team were selected to model the new kit. Earlier this month, Bellingham andÂ ZidaneÂ appeared together in a teaser as the main faces of the campaign, with the French legend modelling a sleek black leather blouson and other items from the Y-3 travel collection.\n\nReal Madrid have looked toÂ YamamotoÂ for inspiration in the past. InÂ 2014/15, he designed a commemorative black kit withÂ dragon motifÂ and produced another signature black and white jersey to mark the clubâs 120th anniversary in 2021/22.Â Madrid donned the all-black stripÂ for the Week 29 ClÃ¡sico against Barcelona, at the BernabÃ©u. It didnât bring them much luck - BarÃ§a, wearing theirÂ SenyeraÂ kit, ended up winning the game 0-4.\n\nHave Madrid ever played at home not wearing white?\n\nFunnily enough, they have. Before tonightâs clash with Athletic, Real Madrid have played twice at the BernabÃ©u not wearing their white home kit. In 2020, they hosted Espanyol playing in a mint green kit, winning that game 2-0. Before that there was the aforementioned Men in Black ClÃ¡sico. Ancelottiâs side hope their new purple kit bring them luck as it did on their travels 1997/98 and 2016/17 when Los Blancos won the SÃ©ptima and DuodÃ©cima.\n\nThe purple Y-3 kit, which is made of 100% recycled polyester jacquard, is now available through the clubâs official stores. The collection also includes two goalkeeper kits, one all-black and one orange, along with a white pre-match kit including a top, shorts and jacket. Manufacturers Adidas assure that the collection âis a fusion of elegance and tradition, bringing together fashion and success in sport and drawing inspiration from the early stages of the collaboration between Adidas and Yamamotoâ."
