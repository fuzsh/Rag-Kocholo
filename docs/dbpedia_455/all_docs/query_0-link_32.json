His significance to Madrid is that he's a good third man in a three man midfield, and a good worker #10 when they're playing a 2 man midfield. Ozil's a better #10, but he was pretty inflexible, and was usually invisible when they tried to play him out wide.\n\nPlus, and this is the big one, he's Spanish. He could be the next Iniesta. He could be the first Spanish Ballon D'Or. So, no pressure on the 21 year old there.\n\nIs he a poor subsitiute for Ozil. Most players would be poor substitutes for Ozil at the things Ozil's good at, but Madrid's midfield were misfiring until Alonso came back. Modric didn't step into the role and it's too early (or not possible?) for Illarramendi.\n\nRight now, he's all about potential but he's still got 6 goals and 4 assists in 13 Liga starts for Madrid. Ozil got 9 goals and 13 assists in the whole of last season. Stats never tell the whole story, but I don't think he's doing bad for a potential player.\n\nDec 22, 2013\n\n#14\n\namolbhatia50k\n\nSneaky bum time - Vaccination status: dozed off\n\nJoined\n\nNov 8, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n96,641\n\nLocation\n\nindia\n\nNot overly impressed by him.

It's no big deal i'm sure, he'll find a way back into that team. Jese isn't ready to play every game (especially in the CL, where Isco has already proven himself once) while Di Maria, like Kagawa/Nani (for lack of a better example) needs to be the MOTM to start the next game (to be fair to him, he is doing just that a lot of the time.
