        "text": "Each teammate tosses one bag at the opposing team’s board. When tossing, the 1st teammate’s bag must land on the board before the 2nd teammate throws his / her bag. If playing with 1 player teams then each player will toss 2 bags. Teams are not allowed to throw bags simultaneously.\n\nBags can be thrown in any fashion, but must land on the board first or go directly through a hole to be counted. Bags that hit the ground are considered out of play and must be removed from the board.\n\nBags are considered “sunk” if they fall completely through any open hole.\n\nIf both players successfully sink separate holes in one round, they are rewarded both bags back and continue to throw.\n\nIf a hole that was covered becomes un-covered because of impact during a round, reset the board placing all covers in their proper place before the second player throws.\n\nOnce a bag is sunk, the hole must be IMMEDIATELY covered.\n\nDefenders are not allowed to touch the board for any reason other than covering a hole that has been sunk or removing a bag that is considered out of play until the round is over. When the round is complete the board must be adjusted if necessary before the next round begins. (Reset covers, realign board, adjust legs, etc.)\n\nDefenders are not allowed to directly interfere with a bag that is being thrown. However, they are allowed to distract the thrower by any means necessary as long as no contact is made with the player, bag, or board. Defenders must also remain behind their tossing line and out of the field of play. If any of these conditions occur then the tossing team is rewarded the bag back and are given another chance to throw.\n\nTo win you must close out every hole on your opponent’s board. If this is achieved by both team members sinking two separate holes then the game is over and there is no redemption.\n\nIf both players successfully make the same hole in one round, it is considered and INSTANT win and the game is over.\n\nOnce the final hole has been sunk, the losing team is allowed a chance at redemption. This gives the losing team an opportunity to take the game to overtime by closing out their opponent’s remaining holes within one round.\n\nEach player will be able to “shoot untill they miss”. They will continue throwing the bag until they fail to close the holes.\n\nIf the losing team is able to close out their opponent’s remaining holes then the game is forced into overtime. If not then the game is over.\n\nRe-racks are only allowed at the begining of your round. Meaning if the first player already threw, you cannot re-rack.\n\nIf both players made one hole each, which gives them “bags back”, it is still technically the same round and you still aren't allowed to re-rack.\n\nThis can happen in one of two ways.\n\n-The defending team isn't paying attention.\n\nIt is important that the defending team places a cover on any hole a bag goes through. If they fail and the second bag goes through the same hole… sorry, you lose!\n\n-You push/bump your partners bag into the same hole.\n\nAnything can happen in BruBag. You could be up 5-0 and your opponent can land a bag which hangs over a hole. The second opponent, can push/bump both bags through the same hole to get an instant win... That’s teamwork!"
