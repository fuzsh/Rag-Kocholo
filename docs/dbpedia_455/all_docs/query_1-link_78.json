        "text": "A mostly disappointing day for the Caribbean ended in more disappointment at the Paris Olympic Games as Jamaica’s Roshawn Clarke and Kyron McMaster of the British Virgin Islands had tough outings in the men’s 400m finals at Stade de France on Friday.\n\nMcMaster, who has endured a topsy-turvy season, placed fifth in a season’s best 47.79s, while Clarke, who was up with the front runners at one point, lost his form, clipped obstacles in the closing stages, and failed to finish.\n\nStill, there was some Caribbean connection on the podium, as American gold medal winner Rai Benjamin is the son of former West Indies stalwart Winston Benjamin. The younger Benjamin, who represented Antigua and Barbuda at the youth level, won in a season’s best 46.46s.\n\nHe upstaged Norwegian World Record holder Karsten Warholm (47.06s), while Brazil’s Alison dos Santos (47.26s) closed fast to claim bronze.\n\nJamaica's young and promising triple jumper, Jaydon Hibbert, came agonizingly close to securing a medal at the Paris Olympic Games, finishing just shy of the podium in fourth place at the Stade de France on Friday.\n\nWith his impressive run of form coming into the global multi-sport showpiece, Hibbert was one of the favourites to earn a medal, but the 19-year-old, who looked a shadow of his usual bubbly self, fell short of the top three with a best leap of 17.61m.\n\nThe event was topped by Spain’s Jordan Alejandro Diaz (17.86m) ahead of Portugal’s Pedro Pichardo (17.84m) and Andy Diaz (17.64m). Cuba’s Lazaro Martinez (17.34m) was eighth.\n\nNo doubt Hibbert’s performance left him with a mix of pride and disappointment, as he entered his Olympic Games debut with high expectations after he consistently delivered strong performances throughout the season.\n\nHowever, the fiercely competitive field in Paris proved to be a challenging environment, and Hibbert was unable to improve on his second attempt. His sequence also includes 17.31m and 17.53m, with his last three attempts having two failures, while he passed on the final attempt, which could be a signal that the jovial athlete might not have been in the best of health.\n\n\"It was a good championship, so firstly, I want to thank God for what He has done. To think that I almost boycotted the Olympics and now I am here today (Friday) standing on a fourth-place finish. I don't think many 19-year-olds can say they came fourth at the Olympics so I am grateful,\" Hibbert said shortly after competition.\n\n\"I got a hard fall on one of the jumps and I felt something so I kind of stopped the competition. Me and coach talked about it, and he was trying to influence me to go back, but I told him that coach, 'I have more years to come' so for now I am grateful for the fourth place, and so it is just the road to recovery from here,\" he added.\n\nDominican Republic's Marileidy Paulino set a new Olympic record to take gold in the women's 400m at the Paris Games on Friday.\n\nPaulino, who won silver in Tokyo three years ago, crossed the finish line in 48.17 seconds, eclipsing Marie-Jose Perec's previous record of 48.25 that had stood since 1996.\n\nIt was the latest confirmation of the Dominican's recent dominance in the event following her victory at last year's World Championships in Budapest.\n\nSalwa Eid Naser of Bahrain finished in second, while Poland's Natalia Kaczmarek claimed bronze.\n\nGreat Britain's Amber Anning finished in fifth, breaking Christine Ohuruogu's British record, which has stood for 11 years, with a time of 49.29 seconds.\n\n\"I’m absolutely blessed. I am a little bit disappointed. I wanted to come away with three things,\" Anning said.\n\n\"It was either a medal, a PB or a national record and I got one of them. I'm just grateful to be in this position with these amazing girls.\n\n\"It was tough [the race], I think I let myself have too much work coming into home straight but I just used my strength.\n\n\"It’s been an amazing experience. \"It’s still not done yet. I've got the relay tomorrow.\""
