        "text": "The Frenchman has endured a tumultous season at the club and has faced increased pressure in the last few weeks.\n\nThere is no doubt that Zinedine Zidane has established himself as one of the best managers in Real Madrid's history.\n\nIn just three seasons with Los Blancos, the Frenchman has won 11 trophies - the second-highest for any Real Madrid manager. He led Real Madrid to a hat-trick of Champions League titles and the club's 34th La Liga title. These are but a few of his many accolades and records that he has attained managing Los Blancos.\n\nBut this season has been different for the Frenchman as his side have been inconsistent and injury problems have only raised the concern of the club. The defending La Liga champions made a great start to their season but lost track along the way, now they trail 10 points behind city rivals Atletico Madrid with the Rojiblancos having an extra game at hand.\n\nThese results have increased the doubts over the Frenchman's future at the Spanish capital. However, here are five reasons why Zinedine Zidane remains the favourite to continue at the helm of Real Madrid.\n\n5. Lack of managers with equal credentials\n\nA notable reason for Zidane's stay could be the lack of managers with similar track record. While there were many suitors considered for the post should Zidane pack his bags, those have since moved on to newer teams - Pochettino to Paris-Saint Germain, Thomas Tuchel to Chelsea and Antonio Conte to Inter last season.\n\nMuch like Zidane made his way from managing Real Madrid Castilla, the youth side, the only possible replacement that they can eye is Real Madrid legend Raul Gonzalez who could follow in the footsteps of his former team-mate. Hence, Real Madrid would rather feel that there aren't managers that fit their requirement and can handle the pressure of delivering the success that the club wants.\n\n4. Zidane's pull in signing players\n\nReal Madrid have made some good signings in the past few years. Obviously the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo shocked everyone and it was important that Madrid address the areas of concerns in terms of replacing the record-breaking Portuguese as well as get younger players for other veterans.\n\nAn important factor in signing quality players like Eden Hazard, Ferland Mendy, Eder Militao and others has been their inclination to play and learn under the tutelage of the legendary Frenchman. Their challenge for the title seems to be all but over this season but Zidane's continued presence could be the difference in Real Madrid getting their targets for the upcoming season and challenge for more trophies.\n\n3. Delinquency in signing reinforcements\n\nIt has been three transfer windows since Real Madrid last signed a player. The Merengues didn't go for any player in both the transfer windows this season and in a season marred by erratic schedules, the squad has been ravaged by injuries with notable players like Sergio Ramos, Eder Militao, Dani Carvajal and Eden Hazard - all facing lengthy spells off the pitch.\n\nReal Madrid being arguably the most demanding club have not backed Zidane with players to challenge for squad places and trophies. They have also sold plenty of squad prospects like Borja Mayoral to Roma and Achraf Hakimi to Inter as well as Dani Ceballos and Martin Odegaard on loan to Arsenal - when the duo seemed set to take on the mantle in midfield.\n\nFor them to sign players to start their new era of dominance, it is imperative that Zinedine Zidane remains at the helm to guide a new generation of players starting with the signing of players like Kylian Mbappe and Eduardo Camavinga.\n\n2. Florentino Perez's immovable trust\n\nEver since he took the presidency at Real Madrid, Perez has underlined Madrid's insatiable desire for success. He has also been unforgiving with managers who haven't delivered that success.\n\nBut the case has been different during the tenure of Zinedine Zidane. Perez has rather turned to make Zidane his favourite and was one of the key reasons for the Frenchman's return after a catastrophic season under Julen Lopetegui and Santiago Solari. Zidane made good on the promise by delivering the La Liga title the previous season. Hence, Perez's rock-solid trust in Zidane's credentials means that the Frenchman is likely to stay for a few more years in the Spanish capital.\n\n1. Respect among the squad\n\nZidane's time at Madrid speaks for himself and his squad contains a great variety of youth and experience. But his credentials as both a manager and as a player preceding that mean that he is highly respected by the players and the entire club.\n\nThe players who have played under him have always maintained their respect and desire to play under Zidane. Players like Casemiro, Kroos, Luka Modric, Ramos and many others hit their peaks and won trophies under the Real Madrid boss and continue to do so. That is down to the belief that he has passed on and the respect and results that have come his way in the process by players current and past (even by future prospects).\n\nHence it is sure to keep Zidane's stature intact in the club's hierarchy and history as a legend, both as a player and perhaps more importantly as a manager."
