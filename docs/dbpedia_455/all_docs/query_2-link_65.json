        "text": "Spatial awareness refers to a player’s ability to see space clearly across the entire pitch and utilize it to their advantage. What does it mean to see space clearly?\n\nFirst of all, players need to be aware of the immediate space around them. According to the position of the ball, their own teammates, and their opponents, where should they be? Should they be moving into a space to receive a pass? Should they be drawing defenders away from their teammate who has the ball to create open space for them?\n\nSecondly, intelligent players are always aware of where their teammates are and where they should be according to the positioning of the other team. There are two reasons they need to know where their teammates are and should be: (1) to tell them where they should be if they’re not there, and (2) to anticipate their teammate’s position and make a quick, instinctive pass almost without looking. In fact, scouts often look for this sixth sense of a footballer.\n\nFinally, intelligent players are extremely aware of the geometry of the game. They know how to position themselves and others to make wide angles and easy passing opportunities for themselves while on offense and narrow angles and difficult passing opportunities for their opponents while on defense.\n\nSpatial awareness is a complicated skill which encompasses many other skills absolutely essential to achieving success in football. In fact, spatial awareness is also closely related to the next game intelligence skill, tactical knowledge.\n\n2. Enrol on an Online Course + Get a Remote UEFA Pro Personal Coach\n\nYes, just like any university degree nowadays, football can also be studied remotely with Ertheo.\n\nThe best thing is that students get the same care and training they would from a face-to-face course. All the basic concepts of the game have been adapted to take students directly to the highest level.\n\nWhat’s more, the course includes the supervision and advice of a remote UEFA Pro personal coach that provides each student with completely personalised evaluations and follow-ups to ensure their continuous improvement throughout the training sessions.\n\nAs for the theoretical part of the course, the syllabus includes the following topics:\n\nOffence: Basic concepts on offensive positioning, tactical insight, and ability to identify and exploit open spaces and opponent’s mistakes, as well as all technical aspects regarding ball control, strikes, dribbles, and passes.\n\nDefence: Defensive positioning on the field, adapting to the most common formations, the behaviour of each defensive position, risk management, and decision making.\n\nOut of Possession: Players are taught what to do when they are not in possession, whether they are close or far from the ball and their team is attacking or defending.\n\nIndividualised Plan for the Start of the Season\n\nAt the beginning of the season, training sessions are focused on improving players’ aerobic endurance. Working on their fitness is crucial for them to have enough energy to practise their technique and the basic aspects of the game.\n\nFurthermore, this stage also involves working on their maximum strength because all competitive athletes must be strong, especially when it comes to contact sports.\n\nPhysical conditioning prepares players for the demands of a high-level match.\n\nIndividual Plan for the Season’s Competitive Period\n\nAt the start of the competitive period of the season, players begin to practise their anaerobic endurance, i.e., their ability to put in a highly intensive physical effort for a short period of time. This part of training is combined with explosive strength and speed sessions.\n\nOnce players are in peak physical condition, it is time to push further and start training their speed, a fundamental quality for being accepted into professional teams and earning playing time.\n\nAdditional Areas of Study\n\nGame Insight\n\nThroughout the course, players will learn how to read a game and have a good understanding on the field.\n\nIn the offensive, defensive, and transition phases, players must be fully aware of their role in each period of gameplay so that they can avoid shortcomings within the team.\n\nThese training sessions test players’ intelligence and aim to drastically improve their decision making and risk management skills while on the field.\n\nOf course, the tactical aspect of the game will also be discussed in depth so that players can adapt to several positions and adjust their game based on different match situations.\n\nSelf-Awareness – Identifying your own Skills\n\nEvery player who wants to succeed in football must be aware of their own limitations and areas for improvement.\n\nIdentifying your strengths and weaknesses is of paramount importance, which is why at Ertheo we teach students about self-analysis and introspection.\n\nReinforcing our strengths and minimising our weaknesses is the safest way to reach the highest level, whereas hiding or denying any shortcomings you may have will only make you stagnate and become a limited player.\n\nWhat’s more, being aware of your faults can help you develop humility, a much needed quality in all walks of life.\n\nInterpersonal-Awareness – Identifying the Opponents’ Skills\n\nThis is basically the same process as the previous point but focusing on the opponent instead of ourselves.\n\nStudying your opponents before a match is a big plus when it comes to identifying their strengths and weaknesses. However, youth ranks don’t usually have the technology and resources to be able to study a team before a match, which is why you have to assess them on the spot.\n\nThis course teaches students to identify which specific technique, action, or movement an opposing player may struggle with in order to take full advantage.\n\nFurthermore, recognizing the opponents’ strengths is just as important, so as to make defensive adjustments as necessary and avoid an opponent making a difference by repeating a previously successful play.\n\nSelf-Control\n\nComposure and good decision making are essential for maintaining control during a match. It is normal for young football players to be more impulsive and frantic, but it is important to understand that every action on the field has a consequence.\n\nSelf-control, the ability to maintain focus throughout a match, and leadership are much sought after qualities by coaches.\n\nIdentifying Open Spaces\n\nOne of the most important parts of an offensive play is being able to identify open spaces between the lines of the opposing team.\n\nOn this course, players will learn how to spot and take advantage of open spaces to imbalance the opposing defence and create windows of opportunity to generate dangerous plays.\n\nThese spaces should not only be recognized by the player in possession of the ball, but also the player who must take that space in a timely manner. All players must therefore learn to identify open spaces and exploit them at the exact moment in order to surprise the rival team.\n\nQuick Thinking\n\nBeing fast on the field is very important, but it’s not much use if you cannot think on your feet before taking action.\n\nThe ability to react and improvise effectively against unexpected plays is something every player should develop.\n\nThe less time available, the harder it is to make a decision, but successful athletes know how to take advantage of these situations by acting quicker, being bolder, and gaining the upper hand.\n\nTaking Advantage of Open Spaces\n\nEven though identifying an open space is step one, it is of no use if a player doesn’t know how to exploit it to throw off the opponent.\n\nThis area of study is focused on space distribution within the field and the effects certain movements and passes can produce in the opposing team.\n\nTime Management\n\nOffensive phases cannot always have the same rhythm. Intensity should fluctuate so as to avoid predictable plays and exploit players’ strengths.\n\nOn this course, players will learn how to manage the tempo of a match according to the score, possession, and other variables.\n\nA quick attack doesn’t always mean a successful one, and this will become very clear to players after the training sessions.\n\nSelf-Analysis\n\nPlayers must constantly self-evaluate in order to keep improving every aspect of their game.\n\nNo one can know your limitations, strengths, and weaknesses better than yourself. It is crucial to recognize the importance of self-analysing your performance and adopting an objective criterion regarding decision making and post-game evaluation.\n\nGym Routine for the Season\n\nThe academy provides each student with a personalised gym routine based on their age, weight, and physical condition. This way, players can make the most of their gym sessions.\n\nExamples of role models according to their position\n\nThere is no better way to learn than by watching the best players in action. On this course, students will study several football role models who play in different positions.\n\nThe aim is to encourage students to incorporate and adapt the technical and tactical resources of these prominent players into their own skill repertoire.\n\n3. Make the Most of your Own Remote UEFA Pro Personal Coach\n\nAnother key advantage of Ertheo’s online course is that it includes a remote personal football coach to provide players with individual follow-up.\n\nTraditional academy coaches are usually in charge of about 20 to 25 players per session and therefore cannot provide the same level of care to all students at the same time. As a result, many players are often neglected and their learning stagnates due to lack of attention.\n\nA great way to counteract this is by hiring an online UEFA Pro personal coach who can monitor the player’s progress remotely. This is a very simple and practical process for both parties; all you have to do is record your matches and training sessions so that your UEFA Pro personal coach can assess your performance.\n\nThe recording needs to be in high resolution and, although it should include an overview of the team’s tactical set-up and other details, it must be focused on you, your movements, and your performance on the field.\n\nThere is no better way to learn than through trial and error. Combine this with the personal coach’s active follow-up and advice, and you will improve exponentially from one training session to the next.\n\nThe online personal trainer will follow all your movements closely to assess your performance, technique, game insight, and every other relevant aspect in a football match. You will receive fully personalised feedback, including evaluations, instructions, and training exercises you must adopt to improve any shortcomings that were identified in the submitted videos. This teaching methodology will make you actively think about the decisions you make on the field.\n\nPersonalised training is always better than group training and now, thanks to your own remote UEFA Pro personal coach, you can benefit from it from the comfort of your own home. Make the most of all the coach’s advice and you will see how quickly your game improves."
