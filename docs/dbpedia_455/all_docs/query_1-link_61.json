Get a spoiler-free peek at what to expect from your visit!\n\nAbsolutely loved it! I am so glad that we were able to make it to this event while we were in NYC a few weeks ago. Go if you can! It was totally immersive and extensive. Sign up at the beginning to participate in tasks along the way! The exhibits were broken up by themes like Houses, Wands or Quidditch! Every room was loaded with props and costumes from the films. The room decor followed along with the themes as well. Test your wand skills, make a potion, defeat a boggart! I took so many photos, I cant imagine picking a few for this review! Again, if you love HP and you have a chance, go!\n\n– Edward Z.\n\nWOW !!!\n\nThis exhibition was completely surprising for us. It was so amazing, the staff were super nice and we had the best time there.\n\nEverything was on point, from the beginning to the end. There are so many things to see and so many room and things to explore. It is a dream for Harry Potter enthusiasts and also for people who are just into movies in general because there is a lot of behind the scenes information, props and original outfits that were super interesting.\n\nWe loved if!\n\n– Shira B.\n\nMy son’s teacher introduced him to the world of Harry Potter. He loved this exhibit and it was interactive and lots of fun. The price to enter was reasonable too.\n\n– Jack\n\nIt was a very good experience, the same vibes like we see in the Harry Potter movie. From Harry’s iconic glasses to Hermione’s elegant robes, the exhibition showcases an extraordinary collection of costumes that instantly transport visitors into the realm of magic. Each character’s attire beautifully captures their personality and essence, allowing fans to feel a deeper connection with their favorite heroes and villains. Whether it’s the intricately detailed robes of Dumbledore or the mischievous outfits of the Weasley twins, the exhibition immerses visitors in the rich tapestry of the Harry Potter universe, leaving them spellbound and craving for more.\n\n– Varun S.\n\nIt was such a great interactive experience. Would recommend to any to Harry Potter and Non HP fans to try!!!! And seeing Hogwarts Legacy come to life.
