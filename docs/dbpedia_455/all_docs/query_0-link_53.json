        "text": "While Real Madrid are yet to suffer a defeat in La Liga this season, youth side Castilla lost their first game of the season this weekend - a frustrating result for lads aspiring to be the Bernabeu's next big stars.\n\nYou might think that it'd be hard to find too many positives in a 2-0 away loss to Getafe's reserves. However, there was one shining light in the dark, dark depths of defeat.\n\nThat shining light was none other than Martin Odegaard .\n\nOdegaard is surely one of the most talked about young prospects in world football at the moment. The 16-year-old Norwegian has already made his senior debut for Los Blancos, while his efforts on the international scene have been widely praised. Watch this footage and you'll see why he's so highly regarded - the skills he shows off here are nothing short of sublime.\n\nIt becomes apparent very early on in the match that Odegaard is a huge fan of the backheel pass - his reverse flick is the stuff dreams are made of. Likewise, we have to praise his penchant for an audacious nutmeg. He absolutely schools at least one opponent here. We certainly wouldn't want to play against him.\n\nHe'll want to help his side improve results, of course. Still, as individual showings go, this was a pretty sweet performance.\n\nWe're testing a new site: This content is coming soon"
