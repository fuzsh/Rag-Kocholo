        "text": "Each bag represents a different team and has been stitched together by hand into a one-off piece of work. Patterns of Play have sourced a number of statement retro football shirts and transformed them in a piece of merchandise that can be used in a number of ways. There's something quite pure about the collection, something almost school-project about it, and we're absolutely all over it. Definitely an alternative boot bag for the season.\n\nThe first drop focused on the Premier League and English Football League, but the follow up collection features throwback replica shirts from some of Europe's most blockbuster clubs including Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. It's a statement to modify such immensely timeless retro shirts, but the risk has paid off as Patterns of Play offer something completely niche to a market with a huge throwback thirst right now."
