We just released our NEW MR1 Sustainable Golf Bag. 40 plastic water bottles were recycled to make one of these.

        "text": "The amount of detail and customer service that went into my bag is unheard of these days! The team was so hands on, very responsive & beyond accommodating. I love my bag from the design to the functionality and ESPECIALLY love that I can charge my phone while playing! All the attention to the golfers detailed wants were obvious & appreciated !I could go on & on, but I think Iâ€™m living up to the title of this review!\n\nNot sure how 40 used water bottles can make such a beautiful bag feel just like expensive leather, but that's just what MNML GOLF has done with the MR1 Bag. I love the magnetic pockets and the ease with which they open. All the pockets have specific functions that Sam explains to us in a video. I am a diabetic on a insulin pump and I need to pack the cooler pocket with snacks that will bring my sugar up in a hurry if it drops. I used to use a separate bag for the diabetes supplies, but now I don't have to because the MR1 has the cooler pocket that works perfectly for me. I actually don't even need all the pocket space it offers. This bag is lightweight by design and it's easier to keep it lightweight if I don't fill the pockets with unnecessary items of clutter. My bag has 10 balls, several tees, diabetic snacks and a rangefinder. That's really all I need in the pockets along with my clubs for a great day on the course. This is absolutely the finest golf bag I have ever used in 50 years of playing. Congratulations Sam, to you and your team on an outstanding bag design. If you are looking for a new bag, I would definitely recommend the MR1.\n\nA year ago, I called and had a conversation with their team about MNML bags vs the competitors. I was very impressed with the brand, the products, and the people. Since June of 2023, my bag has held up beautifully. I chose White and it's easy to clean if it looks dirty and all features continue to perform as expected. I always get looks and compliments on how nice of a bag it is. Couldn't be happier with the purchase. MNML has my support with everything the company is doing for golf and the local community!\n\nI had my doubts about the magnetic closures on the bag. Surely they can't stay closed, right? I was wrong! They're perfect and stay closed all the time. I did get the solar panel with the speaker and it does take a bit for the panel to charge the battery after being inside all winter. The solution is to plug the cable into a normal USB charger and it will charge the battery the first time so you can use it all summer.\n\nSpeaker is better than I thought; it is loud and sounds good.\n\nI wish it had one more pocket somewhere as I've always got what seems to be about 10 of everything I think I need in my golf bag. This bag will help you keep you from overloading it though, which is always a good thing."
