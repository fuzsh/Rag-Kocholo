        "text": "There are two sets of foul lines: open adult play and junior play for children 12 and under. The adult foul lines shall be defined as an imaginary line 27 feet between the front of each board. The junior-play foul lines shall be defined as an imaginary line 12-15 between the front of each board. Physically impaired adults or seniors may observe the 12-15 foot foul lines if agreed by all contestants. The foul line should be parallel to the front of the opposite board to meet ACA guidelines.\n\nAny bag that contacted the court or the ground before coming to rest on the board shall be ruled a dead bag.\n\nAny bag that struck a previously defined object such as a tree limb, wire, indoor court ceiling, etc. shall be ruled a dead bag.\n\nImmediately remove the bag from play and continue the inning. The offending team is not assessed any penalty or foul.\n\nIf the bag impacts another bag, remove the offending bag where it lies and leave the remaining bags as they lie and continue play. The offending team is not assessed any penalty or foul.\n\nA bag that leaves a playerâ€™s hand once the final forward swing of the delivery process has started shall count as a pitched bag.\n\nA bag that is accidentally dropped by a player before the final forward swing has started shall not be considered foul and may be picked up and pitched.\n\nIf players believe they have thrown all bags, clear the board for the next inning, but then realize they missed one bag, the inning ends. Points are scored as if the inning ended, and the missed bag is forfeited.\n\nAny action or intentional use of a penalty that undermines the integrity of the game, as determined by the court official, will result in the player's disqualification and forfeiture of the match."
