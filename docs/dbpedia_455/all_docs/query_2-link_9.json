        "text": "Position: Forward\n\nMatches played: 463 official matches, 106 friendlies\n\nGoal: 171\n\nSpanish International: 69 matches\n\nButragueÃ±o was a football genius and a Real Madrid legend who turned football into an art form. His dribbling was simply out of this world and his goals were the stuff of dreams. His intelligence on the pitch was too much for the brute strength of defenders and he turned the game into something sublime. His nickname (the âVultureâ) came to represent one of the best generations of players in the history of Real Madrid and Spanish football when, along with SanchÃ­s, MÃ­chel, MartÃ­n VÃ¡zquez and Pardeza, he led the famous âQuinta del Buitreâ (âThe Vulture Squadronââ).\n\nHis vision of the game and his ability to improvise led scouts from AtlÃ©tico de Madrid to try to sign him, but ButragueÃ±o and his father were members of Real Madrid and he wanted to play for the team he supported. Thatâs why he eventually signed for the Real Madrid youth team.\n\nWhile he was playing for Real Madrid Castilla, his name started to appear on the front pages of newspapers. His goal scoring statistics were already spectacular and Alfredo Di StÃ©fano called him up to the first team and he made his full debut on the 5th of February 1984 in CÃ¡diz. He came onto the pitch wearing the number 14 shirt and turned the game on its head by scoring two goals and making a third.\n\nHe made a decisive contribution to winning the UEFA Cup two years running (1985 and 1986) and his performances in this competition earned him recognition from all around Europe. He also won the âBravo Trophyâ for the best Under-24 player on two consecutive occasions. Along with Hugo SÃ¡nchez he was part of a legendary attacking duo for many seasons at Real Madrid.\n\nFor 12 years he was a regular for the team and without being an out-and-out goalscorer he won the Pichichi Trophy. ButragueÃ±o retired as a Madrid player on the 15th of June 1995 in a testimonial against Roma. The BernabÃ©u showed their gratitude for his dedication to the Whites and left thanking the club he had loved as a fan and a player and that he still loves today."
