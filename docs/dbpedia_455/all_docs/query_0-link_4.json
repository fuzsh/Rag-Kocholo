        "text": "Spanish former footballer (born 1982)\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is García and the second or maternal family name is Portillo.\n\nJavier García Portillo (born 30 March 1982) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a forward.\n\nHe started out at Real Madrid and appeared in 59 competitive games during his tenure, scoring 17 goals. In La Liga, he also played for Gimnàstic, Osasuna and Hércules for a total of 131 matches and 21 goals, and also competed professionally in Italy and Belgium.[2]\n\nIn a 14-year senior career, Portillo represented Hércules in all three major levels of Spanish football.\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nPortillo was born in Aranjuez, Community of Madrid. In 1994, aged 12, he entered Real Madrid's youth system. Over seven seasons he was a prolific scorer, netting 370 goals and breaking a record previously held by Raúl.[3] In August 2002 he signed his first professional contract, running until 2006 with a buyout clause of €15 million.[4]\n\nOn 6 October 2002, Portillo made his first La Liga appearance and second overall for the main squad, starting in a 5–2 home win over Deportivo Alavés[5] and ending that season with five goals in only ten games. He also scored a vital last-minute equaliser against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League second group phase, a goal which ultimately proved to be crucial to reach the knockout stages.[6]\n\nPortillo was loaned to Serie A side ACF Fiorentina in July 2004, but was recalled by new manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo, who arrived midway through the 2004–05 campaign.[7] However, the same coach deemed him surplus to requirements and another loan ensued, to Club Brugge KV of the Belgian Pro League.[8]\n\nAt the end of this loan period, Portillo returned to Real under newly hired coach Fabio Capello. With new signing Ruud van Nistelrooy adding to already present Raúl, Antonio Cassano and Ronaldo, he was released and signed a two-year contract with recently promoted Gimnàstic de Tarragona.[9]\n\nAfter a successful individual season (12 goals in all competitions, although the Catalans were relegated from the top flight),[10] in July 2007 Portillo replaced at Osasuna Roberto Soldado, who returned from loan to Real Madrid.[11] He was used irregularly in his first two years, and only netted three times in the league.\n\nIn late December 2009, Portillo – who was only fourth or fifth-choice striker for Osasuna coach José Antonio Camacho[12]– finally moved clubs, signing until the end of the season plus two more with Segunda División's Hércules CF. After some time to adjust he finished in the starting XI, netting vital goals in the final stretch, including one in the last round for a 2–0 victory at Real Unión as the Alicante side returned to the first division after 13 years.[13]\n\nPortillo returned to reserve status in 2010–11, after Hércules signed David Trezeguet and Nelson Valdez in the off-season.[14] He only started through injury or suspension to the pair, and scored just twice in official matches, one coming in a 3–1 away defeat of Real Sociedad on 3 April 2011,[15] with Hércules being immediately relegated.\n\nOn 2 August 2011, Portillo signed for three years with UD Las Palmas in the second tier.[16] For the 2012–13 season, however, he moved teams again, returning to Hércules on a three-year deal.[17]\n\nIn late December 2015, Portillo announced his retirement at the age of 33.[18] Subsequently, he worked as his last club's director of football.[19]\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nMaking his debut in 2002 – shortly after his arrival at the Real Madrid senior setup – Portillo played ten times for Spain under-21s, and scored five goals.[20][21][22]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition[23][24] Club Season League Cup Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Real Madrid 2001–02[25] La Liga 0 0 0 0 1 1 – 1 1 2002–03[25] 10 5 6 8 7 1 1[a] 0 24 14 2003–04[25] 18 1 7 1 4 0 1[b] 0 30 2 2004–05[25] 3 0 1 0 0 0 – 4 0 total 31 6 14 9 12 2 2 0 59 17 Real Madrid B 2001–02[25] Segunda División B 23 15 0 0 – – 23 15 Fiorentina (loan) 2004–05[26] Serie A 11 1 7 3 0 0 – 18 4 Club Brugge (loan) 2005–06[26] Belgian Pro League 24 8 0 0 8 3 – 32 11 Gimnàstic 2006–07[25] La Liga 34 11 2 1 0 0 – 36 12 Osasuna 2007–08[25] La Liga 18 2 2 0 0 0 – 20 2 2008–09[25] 20 1 2 0 0 0 – 22 1 2009–10[25] 2 0 1 0 0 0 – 3 0 total 40 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 45 3 Hércules 2009–10[25] Segunda División 16 5 2 0 0 0 – 18 6 2010–11[25] La Liga 26 1 2 1 0 0 – 28 2 total 42 6 4 1 0 0 0 0 46 7 Las Palmas 2011–12[25] Segunda División 34 8 1 0 0 0 – 35 8 Hércules 2012–13[25] Segunda División 40 17 1 0 0 0 – 41 17 2013–14[25] 38 10 0 0 0 0 – 38 10 2014–15[25] Segunda División B 33 9 1 1 0 0 – 34 10 2015–16[25] 13 0 1 0 0 0 – 14 0 total 124 36 3 1 0 0 0 0 127 37 Career total 363 94 36 15 20 5 2 0 421 114\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nReal Madrid\n\nLa Liga: 2002–03[23]\n\nSupercopa de España: 2003[23]\n\nUEFA Champions League: 2001–02[2]\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 2002[23]\n\nIndividual\n\nCopa del Rey top scorer: 2002–03 (8 goals)[27][28][29][30][31]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
