Its coach - and at the same time a former player - is the legendary Ra√∫l Gonzalez, who with Real won the Champions League three times, celebrated winning the Spanish title six times and added countless individual awards.\n\nThe Castilla club has produced stars and legendary icons, including Iker Casillas, Esteban Cambiasso, Alvaro Arbeloa, and Vicente del Bosque.\n\nIt has produced the younger generation, including the likes of Martin √ñdegaard, Nacho or √Ålvaro Morata and countless others.\n\nThis year, Theo Zidane, whose father is none other than the famous Zinedine Zidane, is among the currently playing for the team.\n\nEuropean Cup rules have only allowed Real B to peek into international competition once in their history.\n\nSpecifically, this happened during the 1980/81 season, when Castilla crushed England's West Ham 3:1 at home but lost the rematch 1:5 after extra time.\n\nA rich past, a high reputation and an emphasis on nurturing young talents make the Madrid B team a very high-quality team."
