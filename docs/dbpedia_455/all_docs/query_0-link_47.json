        "text": "Hatim Alintop’s birthday on Wednesday has brought back memories of his short stay at Real Madrid, who he helped to win the La Liga title before moving to Galatasaray.\n\nThe former Turkey international made just 12 appearances for Los Blancos after arriving from Bayern Munich on a free transfer.\n\nHe lasted just one season at the Santiago Bernabeu as he struggled to convince under Jose Mourinho, before being handed an exit route by the Turkish Super Lig giants.\n\nThough Alintop had been one of the stars of Euro 2008, being named in the team of the tournament, his stay at Madrid has largely been forgotten.\n\nHere, Daily Star Sport looks at seven other players whose Madrid career has been lost to history as Alintop celebrates his 39th birthday…\n\nSamuel Eto'o\n\nKnown for his five-year spell at Barcelona, Samuel Eto’o actually started his career at their El Clasico rivals Madrid.\n\nThe Cameroon striker joined the Los Blancos academy set-up in 1996, but made just seven appearances in all competitions, without scoring a goal.\n\nHe was sold to Mallorca in 2000 for what now seems like a total steal for £4.4million, but his greatest success was to come at Barca.\n\nEto’o won three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues at the Nou Camp, before firing Inter Milan to their famous treble in 2009/2010.\n\nWho will win La Liga this season? Let us know in the comments section...\n\nMarcos Alonso\n\nA regular for Chelsea as they won the Champions League last season, Marcos Alonso spent the beginning of his career in the Spanish capital.\n\nAfter graduating into the club’s Castilla reserve team, Alonso featured heavily in Segunda B, before being called into the senior squad by Manuel Pellegrini.\n\nHe only made one appearance for Los Blancos, in an away win at Mallorca, before joining Bolton in 2010.\n\nNuri Sahin\n\nNuri Sahin endured a disastrous three-year spell at the Bernabeu after being bought by Jose Mourinho for £8.5m.\n\nThe midfielder had highlighted the chance to play under Mourinho as his main motivation for joining Los Blancos, but would feature just 10 times under the Portuguese.\n\nHe then had a forgettable loan spell at Liverpool, before returning to Borussia Dortmund for £7m after scoring just one goal for Madrid.\n\nFabinho\n\nSurprisingly, Fabinho’s time at Real Madrid was as a loan spell with the Castilla team, arriving from Rio Ave.\n\nThe Brazilian impressed enough in the Segunda Division to earn a promotion to the senior side, though he made only one appearance, as a sub in a 6-2 La Liga win over Malaga.\n\nHe returned to Rio Ave after that single season in Spain, before winning Ligue 1 with Monaco to earn a £44m move to Liverpool.\n\nJuan Mata\n\nValencia and Chelsea were where Juan Mata came to prominence, but he also enjoyed a successful youth career at Madrid.\n\nMata joined the Los Blancos academy as a 15-year-old from Real Oviedo before graduating to the Castilla team in 2006.\n\nDespite their relegation from the Segunda Division, Mata finished as their second-highest goalscorer, earning a move to Valencia.\n\nAlvaro Negredo\n\nAlvaro Negredo had not one, but two separate spells at Real Madrid, with the first coming between 2005 and 2007.\n\nHe scored 22 goals over those two seasons and earned several appearances in the matchday squad for the senior side, though never made it onto the pitch.\n\nThe striker was sold to Almeria in 2007, before Madrid exercised a buy-back option to bring him back to the Bernabeu in 2009.\n\nLos Blancos boss Pellergrini could not guarantee him first-team minutes though and he was sold just a few weeks later to Sevilla.\n\nEsteban Cambiasso\n\nArguably the man who had the most successful Madrid career of the players on this list is Esteban Cambiasso, who had two spells with Real.\n\nHis first spell came as a member of their academy when he featured for the Castilla team, before moving to Independiente and River Plate.\n\nHe returned to the Bernabeu in 2002, featuring 65 times in his final two seasons in the Spanish capital.\n\nThe Argentine won La Liga, the Supercopa de Espana, UEFA Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup in those two years before heading to Inter Milan."
