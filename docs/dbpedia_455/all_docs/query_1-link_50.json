        "text": "Martin Odegaard arrived at Real Madrid at the age of 16, after a film-like recruitment process that took him to the major training centers of Europe.\n\nHis arrival, surrounded by spotlights and hopes, took away his adolescence in one fell swoop. Now, after leaving the club and becoming a star in the Premier League, he reviews his career with a letter in The Players Tribune with special attention to those years in which he dreamed of a long Estadio Santiago Bernabeu career.\n\nOn the long journey it took to finally decide on a club, the Norwegian midfielder played down the importance of it.\n\n\"My dad handled everything with the clubs, and there were many. We went to Bayern, Dortmund, Man United, Liverpool, Madrid, Arsenal too,\" Odegaard wrote in The Players Tribune.\n\n\"They took us on private planes and made us feel special. I came close to choosing Arsenal. When we went there, I was able to train at London Colney. I met Arsene Wenger.\n\n\"He took me and Dad out for dinner. That was great, but also strange. It's Arsene Wenger, you know? He's this legend I grew up watching on TV, and now I'm sitting in front of him eating steak.\"\n\nHe eventually chose Real Madrid, with the club expecting him to be a long-term success in the Spanish capital.\n\n\"I talked about it a lot with my dad and the rest of my family. In the end, Real Madrid is Real Madrid,\" he continued.\n\n\"They were the Champions League champions with the best players in the world. At the time, I loved Isco, he was so smooth on the ball.\n\n\"But the really key thing about Real Madrid's offer was that they had a B team where I could play competitive football straight away, and the coach of that team? Zinedine Zidane.\n\nMany cite the star treatment Odegaard received in Madrid as the eventual reason for his downfall in the Spanish capital, although the midfielder added further detail.\n\n\"They sent a plane to pick us up from Norway in the morning. Very early in the morning. So, I wake up but I'm still half asleep. My hair is all over the place. I didn't have time to shower. I just put on the clothes I was able to grab quickly, put something smarter in a bag and we took the flight,\" he added.\n\n\"I figure once I get to the hotel in Madrid I can change, shower, get ready, you know? Suddenly, I'm sitting next to Madrid legend Emilio Butragueno, who's wearing a very smart suit, of course, and I'm being introduced to the world.\n\n\"I know you've seen the pictures. Me, in this old striped jumper, not even showered, trying to straighten my hair with my hands. This was the greatest day of my life, the pictures went all over the world. I'm supposed to be this player that Real Madrid have beaten everyone to sign and I look like a random schoolboy who's just been taken off the stadium tour.\"\n\nTraining with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale\n\nAs part of his training plan, Odegaard worked with the senior team, which put him in close quarters with icons such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.\n\n\"It was surreal. I'm not old enough to drive, so my dad has to take me to train with Isco and Ronaldo, Ramos, Bale and Benzema,\" he declared.\n\n\"It was like he was dropping me off at school. But they were all very nice, and the ones who spoke English looked after me a lot at the beginning.\"\n\nHis life playing for Castilla wasn't perfect, and his performances drew a lot of criticism, which the Norwegian believes was warranted.\n\n\"With Castilla, I wasn't with them regularly, so I didn't find that connection. In the first team I was just a kid who came to train. I didn't take part in the games. I felt a bit like an outsider. I was stuck in the middle.\n\n\"I stopped playing with the spark that was typical of my game. I was a bit too reserved for a while. I was more worried about not making mistakes than actually playing my game.\n\n\"The press came after me for not immediately living up to expectations. I was an easy target. If you really know me, you know I smile a lot, but I think from the outside sometimes my face looks grumpier than I really am! It made it easier for them to write about how I was struggling to adapt.\n\n\"Maybe if I had been Spanish, they would have given me a little more time to grow up. Honestly, I don't know. There is no middle ground in modern football. You're either the best signing ever, or you're shit\".\n\nThe tale of Odegaard's return to Real Madrid begins with a hugely successful loan spell with Real Sociedad. He had developed into one of LaLiga Santander's most creative players, and it just made sense he would go back and be a key figure for Zidane, but it wasn't to be.\n\n\"I had a good connection with Zidane from when he coached Castilla and he looked after me a lot, so I wanted to believe it would work out this time... but then I got COVID.\n\n\"I started the first two games of that season in 2020-21, but I wasn't fully recovered. I didn't play at my best and after that, I didn't get many more chances. Almost none at all. Meanwhile, I'm watching Real Sociedad on TV thinking, I could still have been there.\n\n\"I can only thank Madrid for betting on a 16-year-old kid. Everyone meant well and I don't blame anyone, but I needed to find a place where I could settle down. I needed to find a real home. I found it in London.\""
