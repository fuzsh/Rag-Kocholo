        "text": "The USWNT are once again SheBelieves Cup champions, defeating Canada in a penalty kick shootout following a 2-2 draw.\n\nAfter the team went down 1-0 at the half, Sophia Smith scored a brace to put the USWNT ahead 2-1. Adriana Leon would provide both goals for Canada, which included a late equalizer to send the game to penalties.\n\nFollowing the game, USWNT interim head coach Twila Kilgore – who coached her final game at the helm of the national team – said that Smith’s play was another example of her “being a special player in a special moment within our team concept.”\n\n\"The first goal was just class,\" Kilgore said. \"Sometimes individuals just do special things. It was a left-footed finish for Soph in a crowded box, just an exceptional moment, but also there's a big team concept there.\"\n\nAlthough Smith started the game on the right wing she later moved to her preferred No. 9 position.\n\nFour minutes later, Smith scored her second of the game. She was subsequently named MVP of the SheBelieves Cup.\n\n\"I just try to do my job when I'm told I need to step up,\" Smith said. \"I don't think anything of that. I try to lead this team in any way I can and if that's putting the ball in the back of the net for the PKs or in the game, that's what I pride myself in and that's what I'm trying to do.\"\n\nSubstitutes Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman made late impact on the game, resulting in Smith’s second goal of the night, in which Jaedyn Shaw also played a part.\n\n\"I know an Olympic roster is very small, and we have a very talented player pool,\" Smith said. \"So I'm just trying to put myself in the best position every day to make that [Olympic] roster, and by me doing that I'm making players around me better and they're making me better.\"\n\nOlympic basketball enters the semifinals today, with a red-hot Team USA taking another important step toward seizing their eighth-straight Olympic gold.\n\nAfter soundly defeating Nigeria 88-74 in their quarterfinal, the US cruised to a comfortable 83-64 win over Australia this morning to reach Sunday's gold medal match. Plus, they got the job done by recording double-digit wins throughout the Paris tournament.\n\nThe last time the US failed to make an Olympic gold medal game was in 1992, when they last suffered any defeat at the Olympic level.\n\nTeam USA extends Olympic win streak with semifinal victory\n\nThe victory gave the US their 60th straight win at the Olympic Games, once again showcasing depth and talent from every player on the roster.\n\nAfter finishing pool play with an impressive +58 point differential, the team's dominance has continued in the knockout rounds.\n\nThe reigning Olympic champions pushed the margin even further against Australia, with their lead ballooning to 30 points early in the fourth quarter.\n\nFrance vs. Belgium will decide gold medal match\n\nThe US must now wait to find out their gold medal opponent later this afternoon, and today's second semifinal could bring even more fireworks when it tips off at 3 PM ET.\n\nHost nation France will take on Belgium, a team with a wealth of fans traveling to Paris to cheer on their national team.\n\nFrance has appeared self-assured throughout the Olympic tournament, with a pool play loss to Australia their only blemish thus far. But Belgium has looked similarly dangerous, with their only loss coming at the hands of the US in the group stage.\n\nBelgium forward Emma Meesseman set a new record for consecutive 20-point Olympic performances with seven, a stat that dates back to the Tokyo Games. France, however, should feel confident in their attempt to better their bronze medal finish in Tokyo, relying on Marine Johannes's sharpshooting combined with Gabby Williams's stellar overall play.\n\nHow to watch Sunday's Olympic gold medal game\n\nWith 60-straight wins behind them, the US has only one game left between them and historic Olympic glory. They'll go for gold against either France or Belgium on Sunday at 9:30 AM ET, with live coverage across NBC networks.\n\nThe USWNT is one match away from their ultimate goal after making their way through a grueling Olympic tournament to advance to Saturday's gold medal game against Brazil.\n\nThis will be the third Olympic gold medal match meeting for the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup finalists, with the US defeating Brazil at the 2004 and 2008 Summer Games to top the podium.\n\nRetiring Marta fuels Brazil's podium push\n\nWhile the USWNT — fresh off a disappointing 2023 World Cup run — are undoubtedly motivated in their push for gold, Brazil might have an even greater galvanizing force. Legendary Brazil footballer Marta announced in April that the 2024 Games would be her last international tournament with Brazil — a team that's never before won a World Cup or Olympic title.\n\nWhat's more, Marta's teammates carried the burden of reaching the gold medal game: The 38-year-old will return on Saturday after a two-game red card suspension dating back to the team's final group stage game against Spain.\n\nAttacking key to USWNT Olympic gold medal success\n\nThe US most recently defeated Brazil 1-0 at the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup final behind Lindsey Horan's 46th-minute goal in stoppage time. That said, Brazil arguably has more immediate momentum after rattling off two major upsets in the Olympic knockout rounds, first against France and then Spain.\n\nTo win, the US will have to stifle Brazil's potent attack in what will likely be an open end-to-end battle, while simultaneously converting their chances in front of goal.\n\nGermany denies World Cup champs in bronze medal match\n\nGermany beat Spain 1-0 in this morning's bronze medal contest, leaving the reigning World Cup champions and early tournament favorites without a medal for their efforts in Paris.\n\nGiulia Gwinn put Germany ahead in the second half, sinking a penalty after being fouled in Spain's 18-yard box. Later, Gotham FC goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger once again played the hero for Germany, saving an Alexia Putellas penalty kick in second-half stoppage time to secure the clean sheet.\n\nHow to watch USWNT vs. Brazil in the Olympic gold-medal match\n\nThe USWNT kicks off the gold medal match against Brazil on Saturday at 11 AM ET, with live coverage across NBC networks.\n\nIn perhaps their toughest Olympic task so far, USA Volleyball took down Brazil 3-2 in this morning’s back-and-forth semifinal to advance to Sunday’s gold medal match.\n\nThe win guarantees the US a seventh Olympic podium finish and the chance to repeat their Tokyo gold medal win — a feat they accomplished by beating Brazil back in 2021.\n\nA volleyball rivalry with Olympic history\n\nThe longtime rival nations have met on the Olympic court many times, including five medal contests over the last eight Olympics.\n\nIn those five matches, Brazil walked away with three medals (two gold, one bronze), while Team USA notched one gold and one bronze in two wins.\n\nTeam USA ends Brazil's Olympic gold medal hopes\n\nWhile there wasn’t a medal on the line in this morning's five-set thriller, the teams definitely played like there was. The US struck first, taking the first set before trading the next three with Brazil, who forced the deciding fifth set largely off the outstanding play of star Gabi Guimarães.\n\nBut the States shifted into gear in the fifth, downing Brazil 15-11 off a Kathryn Plummer kill to clinch a spot in Sunday's final.\n\nPlummer led the US with 26 points, while fellow outside hitter Avery Skinner and opposite Annie Drews contributed an impressive 19 and 18, respectively.\n\nWhat's next for USA Volleyball\n\nToday's win might have been the USA’s toughest challenge on their path to back-to-back gold, but to complete the job, they’ll have to take down the winner of today’s Turkey-Italy semifinal.\n\nThe volleyball gold medal match will kick off on Sunday at 7 AM ET, with live coverage across NBC networks.\n\nUSA Beach Volleyball loses Olympic medal bid\n\nOver on the sand, Team USA’s last hope for a beach volleyball medal vanished in Tuesday’s quarterfinal round, making this the first Summer Olympics without a US team on the podium since 2000.\n\nLast-standing US pair Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes fell in straight sets to Switzerland’s Nina Brunner and Tanja Hüberli, just one day after fellow US duo Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth fell in the round of 16.\n\nIt’s a disappointing finish for a national contingent that’s claimed four of the previous five gold medals — most recently by Alix Klineman and April Ross’s Tokyo A-Team."
