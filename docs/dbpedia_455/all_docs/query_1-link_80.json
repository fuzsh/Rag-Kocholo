        "text": "Reports from Spain indicate that new signing Kylian Mbappé is set to become Real Madrid's new free-kick taker\n\n25-year-old Mbappé has yet to score a goal from a direct free-kick, whether for his club or national team\n\nDecisions have also been made regarding which players will handle Real Madrid's other set-pieces this season\n\nReal Madrid face a significant challenge following Toni Kroos's retirement as they search for a new free-kick specialist.\n\nKroos was renowned for his excellence in set-piece situations, whether delivering precise passes to teammates or taking shots on goal himself.\n\nIt seems that Los Blancos have now chosen the player who will assume Kroos's role in taking direct free-kicks.\n\nMarca reports that Carlo Ancelotti has chosen new signing Kylian Mbappé to handle free-kicks in dangerous positions.\n\nWhile this role is typically reserved for the team's standout player, Mbappé's impressive but not necessarily outstanding free-kick record raises questions about his suitability for the job.\n\nWhat is Mbappe's free kick record?\n\nDuring his tenure at AS Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain, Mbappé scored an impressive 192 goals in 246 appearances, per Transfermarkt.\n\nHowever, none of those goals were from direct free-kicks, which makes his selection as the primary free-kick taker somewhat perplexing.\n\nIn total, the Frenchman has attempted nine direct free-kicks without scoring, with an expected goals (xG) of just 0.58.\n\nHe has been far more successful from the penalty spot, converting 20 of 24 attempts.\n\nMadrid get new penalty taker\n\nMeanwhile, Ancelotti and his charges have decided to entrust Vinícius Junior with penalty-taking duties.\n\nThe Brazilian has been focusing on practising penalties in training since his return from vacation, aiming to enhance his skills in this area.\n\nThis will certainly and in no doubt help Vinícius in his pursuit of the Pichichi trophy next season.\n\nKylian Mbappe receives strict car rules at Real Madrid\n\nBriefly News also reported that Mbappe must adhere to strict car rules after receiving his new vehicle at Real Madrid.\n\nThe former PSR forward expected to use his BMW i7 M70 exclusively for trips to the club's training facility in Valdebebas, matches, and other club-related events.\n\nIf the Frenchman or any other player arrives at Real Madrid’s facilities in a non-BMW vehicle, they will face significant fines from the club."
