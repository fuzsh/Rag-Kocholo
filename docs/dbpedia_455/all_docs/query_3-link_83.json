No matter where or how you play it, the rules are simple, easy-to-follow and provide the foundation for a consistent, entertaining game to take place, no matter the crowd.\n\nCornhole (also known as Bag-toss or Baggo), begins with 2 teams. A doubles game has 4 total players, 2 on each team. A singles game has two players, total, on opposite teams.\n\nThere are 8 total bags in a Cornhole Game that are separated into two groups, each group with it’s own color and an assigned team.\n\nThe cornhole boards have a 24in x 48in scoring platform, with a 6in hole that is 6in from the top of the board. Each board is placed opposite of each other, on the ground, exactly 27 feet apart from front to front.\n\nA coin flip determines which team goes first. After the coin flip, players will retreat to their respective starting locations. There is a starting side and a spectating side. It is important to note that the starting side has 1 player from each team which mirrors the spectating side. The players who decide to start will begin their round at the starting side, and the team who won the coin flip will throw first for that round. All 8 bags start at one side. Players must not cross the foul line, during play, which is defined by the front edge of the board and extends to the left and right, as well as the edge of the board (the play area, or throw area, does not intersect the plane of the board, nor does it intersect the area between both boards). After the first team throws 1 bag, the player on the same side throws one of their bags, each player trying to get a higher score.\n\nCornhole Keynotes\n\nTeam members at opposite boards\n\nTeam members face each other\n\n8 bags start at one side\n\nThe loser of the coin flip, on the starting side, tosses second\n\nPlayers alternate throws until no bags remain\n\nThe score is counted\n\nThe team that wins the round will throw first in the following round\n\nIf there is a tie, the team that throws does not change\n\nScoring\n\nThe difference-of-points are added to the winning team’s score.\n\nThe difference-of-points is important, so these instructions will explain how to easily calculate per round.\n\nIf red team scores 3 points by successfully landing 3 bags on the face of the board, without foul, and blue team successfully lands 1 bag on the face of the board, we can “cancel out” 1 red bag and 1 blue bag, and we are left with 2 red points.\n\nIf blue team scored 1 point on the face of the board and red teamscored 1 bag in the hole, for 3 points, red team would still have 1 point at the end of the round.\n\nWinning the Game\n\nThe game continues, with each side alternating rounds, until one team reaches 21 points. To make the score transparent for all players, even in a busy environment, AJJ Cornhole offers the Scoretower Single (product link)."
