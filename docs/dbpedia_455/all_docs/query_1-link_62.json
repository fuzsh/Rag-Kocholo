        "text": "Real Madrid are undoubtedly one of the clubs brimming with history and legacy. In its 120 years of history, the glory of Los Blancos is a tough job for any other team to match. They have dominated the numbers in La Liga and also European competitions.\n\nMadrid's reputation has always attracted some of the best players in history. Many of these players have gone on to induct themselves as Hall of Famers within the realm of football. Los Blancos have always been the dream club for a lot of young footballers. However, establishing themselves as long-timers in the Santiagoo Bernabeu is no easy task.\n\nWith a massive reputation comes massive pressure and of course, the Santiago Bernabeu fans are always demanding. Only a few players have been fortunate enough to be a part of the club for a long time. Let's take a look at them.\n\n#5 Fernando Hierro â 601\n\nBetween 1989 and 2003, Fernando Hierro graced Real Madrid's centre-back position. The Spaniard joined Los Blancos as a budding youngster. His defensive skills combined with impeccable goal scoring ability came as a boon for the club.\n\nHierro amassed 37 goals across all competitions in his first season at the club. He then raised the bar to 44 goals across all competitions during the 1991-92 season, which was also his career best.\n\nHierro was later appointed the club's captain and was also the assistant manager during the 2014-15 season.\n\n#4 Sergio Ramos â 671\n\nFrom being a young kid from Sevilla to becoming one of Madrid's most successful leaders, Sergio Ramos has come a long way. Ramos is known for his intimidating personality and inch-perfect tackles. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the Spaniard is certainly one of the best defenders in the history of football.\n\nHe donned the classic white kit from 2005 to 2021 before making a shocking switch to Paris Saint-Germain last summer.\n\nUnder Ramos' leadership, Los Blancos grabbed the Champions League three-peat between 2016 and 2018.\n\nEpitome of a classic captain and a level-headed goalscorer, Ramos came up clutch in numerous instances. His extra-time equalizer against Atletico Madrid in the 2014 UCL final will always be one of the most memorable goals in world football.\n\nThe Spaniard, alongside Pepe, knitted one of the scariest defensive duos of all time.\n\n#3 Manolo SanchÃ­s â 687\n\nManolo SanchÃ­s has played for just one club throughout his career. After joining Real Madrid Castilla in 1983 as an 18-year-old, SanchÃ­s earned ocassional call-ups to the senior side. Thanks to his prowess, the Spanish international quickly cemented his position with the senior team.\n\nA talented defensive midfielder, SanchÃ­s also aided his team by filling in the stopperâs position. SanchÃ­s and Hierro built a strong pairing and helped the club in countless matches.\n\nSanchÃ­s played for Los Blancos for 18 years out of which 13 came as captain. He is one of the longest-serving captains in the club's history. SanchÃ­s retired in 2001 with 687 appearances in his bag.\n\n#2 Iker Casillas â 725\n\nIker Casillas' departure in 2015 from the club has to be one of the most painful experiences for any Real Madrid lover. Thankfully, his career was not as bitter as his farewell. Casillas is arguably one of the most loved footballers of all time.\n\nKnown for his charisma, leadership, and goalkeeping skills, the Spaniard earned a reputation that is difficult for any player to match. At the age of 19 years and four days, Casillas became the youngest-ever goalkeeper to feature and win a Champions League final in 2002.\n\nAfter the historic event, the former Spain captain was appointed Real Madrid's No. 1. Casillas won two Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles in his first three seasons. He set a record of 962 minutes without conceding a goal in the Champions League in 2014.\n\n#1 Raul â 741\n\nRaul Gonzalez, popularly known as Raul, is arguably the most celebrated Real Madrid player of all-time. He is also the most prolific and successful native Real Madrid player. If it wasn't for Cristiano Ronaldo, Raul would have been at the pinnacle of every Real Madrid record.\n\nRaul started creating an impression during his youth days at Atletico Madrid. He made a sensational switch to rivals Real Madrid in 1992. After playing for two seasons with the junior side, Raul became a permanent member of the senior team in 1994.\n\nSince then, there was no stopping for the Spaniard as his goal scoring exploits coincided with Real Madrid's success. Raul led the club as captain for seven years.\n\nHe is the fifth-highest goalscorer (228) in the history of La Liga and the highest Spanish scorer (256 goals) in the European leagues. He is also Los Blancos' second-highest goal scorer with 323 goals.\n\nRaul left Real Madrid for Schalke in 2010."
