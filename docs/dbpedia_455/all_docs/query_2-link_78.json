        "text": "Real Madrid’s most recent academy graduate still in the side is currently 32-year-old Dani Carvajal at right-back, but there is genuine hope that might change this season, as Los Blancos look a little shorter in two areas.\n\nIn midfield, Jude Bellingham could move back, despite Carlo Ancelotti’s statements he will not do so, and Arda Guler could also be tested there, but their options primarily consist of Eduardo Camavinga, Aurelien Tchouameni, Luka Modric, Fede Valverde and Dani Ceballos. If the Italian continues to use three midfielders, then it leaves just five players to fill those roles, while Tchouameni could also be required at centre-back.\n\nJesus Vallejo is the fourth central defender coming in for Nacho Fernandez, but it remains to be seen if Ancelotti trusts him with meaningful minutes for the first time in his Real Madrid career at the age of 27. Youngsters Raul Asencio, Jacobo Ramon and Joan Martinez have been used during their preseason tour, with David Alaba also out for several more months.\n\n#Bayer04 are keen to bring back #RealMadrid youngster Melvin Ukpeigbe, who was on loan there last season. pic.twitter.com/qSNys3mId0\n\n— Football España (@footballespana_) August 5, 2024\n\nHowever Diario AS say that the academy player that is doing the most for his case is midfielder Mario Martin, one of two alongside Lucas Vazquez to have played all 180 minutes in preseason so far. Assistant manager Davide Ancelotti is a fan of the combative Martin, and he was included in a number of squads last season.\n\nOn the other hand, Nico Paz impressed against Barcelona, cutting the deficit from a corner with an excellent header. The 19-year-old is a more attacking option though, and feels his time at the club has finished, with no clear path to the first team, and a feeling that he has done all he can at Castilla.\n\nPaz has been linked to the likes of Leganes consistently, and is expected to leave at some point before the end of the window if he can find the right destination. Certainly Martin is a more clear fit – while not a similar player to Toni Kroos, he is more comfortable deeper in midfield. If Tchouameni or Camavinga are used in defence at all, that would open up minutes in a more similar function too."
