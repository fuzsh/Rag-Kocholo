        "text": "Q: I know you're not allowed to ask a fellow player what club he is using. But I noticed a player looking into another player's bag to see what club was missing. Is that OK? - E. O'Toole, The Villages\n\nA: Giving and taking advice during a round of golf is often a misunderstood part of the rules. Rule 8-1 of the USGA Rules of Golf basically states that a player may not give advice to anyone except his playing partner or ask for advice from anyone but his playing partner or either of their caddies.\n\nAfter shots have been hit, it is acceptable to ask what club another player used or to tell another player what you hit. You may not offer such information, however, if the intent is to be misleading (such as claiming, \"5-iron was too much,\" after hitting a shot when your opponent faces a similar shot).\n\nIn your example, it is not breaking the rules to look into your opponent's bag to determine for yourself what club is being used. However, if an opponent covers his bag (with a towel, for example), you would be breaking Rule 8-1 if you then removed the cover to see the clubs.\n\nIn the USGA's Decisions on the Rules of Golf, it states: \"A player is prohibited from obtaining such information through a physical act.\"\n\nQ: The guys I golf with seem to have one reason for every\n\nmishit - \"I looked up.\" Somewhere I once read that the ball is long gone before you can look up. Anyway, is there a mishit that can actually be blamed on looking up?\n\nAlso, I have back problems that are attributable to the way I swing a golf club. Are there types of turns that are less stressful on the back than others? - G. Sarnicki, Ocala\n\nA: I like to think of \"looking up\" as being a symptom,\n\nnot a cause, of a bad shot. What actually happens is a player fails to maintain the proper spine angle during the swing. Often the spine angle moves\n\ncloser to vertical during the swing, taking the player farther from the ball at impact than at setup, resulting many times in a shot hit thin or \"topped.\"\n\nSo what might cause this moving out of the spine angle? It could be that the player has poor balance (which can fixed with a more solid address position), does not rotate properly on the axis of the spine or gets too quick with the arms on the transition to the downswing.\n\nWhen a player moves abruptly into the downswing by throwing the arms out first, the result is that the leverage of that move pulls the body up and out. By slowing down the transition and focusing on the big\n\nmuscles of the back and legs starting the downswing, one may find it easier to \"stay down\" at impact and not \"look up.\"\n\nAs for your back, I think the best thing you can do is to think of your turn as a one-piece move and not a twisting of the body. When you rotate on the backswing, think of your hips, ribs and shoulders all as one piece, rotating together. The key then is to rotate only to that point where you feel resistance or tension begin to build.\n\nMany people thing the backswing is where you turn your shoulders, but not your hips - twisting your body like a pretzel. That's fine if you're Tiger Woods or a 16-year-old girl, but in the real world that\n\nkind of thinking causes more problems than it solves.\n\nBy keeping the upper body in \"one piece\" during the backswing, you put far less strain on your spine and back muscles.\n\nSome golfers will be able to make a longer backswing than others. Just don't worry about how far back one can go compared with yourself. There's no magic formula for how far one should rotate back. For you, that distance is determined by how far your body will let you turn before you start to tighten up.\n\nThe best swings are made when you stay comfortable and relaxed throughout, not when you're fighting through loads of tension.\n\n_____"
