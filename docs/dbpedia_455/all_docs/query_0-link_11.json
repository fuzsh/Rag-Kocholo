        "text": "A somewhat forgotten member of the loan ranks at La Liga giants Real Madrid provided a reminder of his talents on Saturday evening.\n\nThe player in question? Reinier.\n\nBrazilian midfielder Reinier, for his part, spent this past season plying his trade in Italy, with Frosinone.\n\nAnd the 22-year-old’s time in Serie A went on to prove something of a mixed bag, Reinier having managed two goals and two assists across 22 total appearances.\n\nFrosinone, in the end, did not attempt to make Reinier’s arrival a permanent one, with the once so highly sought after talent having therefore since returned to base in Madrid.\n\nNot part of the plans of first-team boss Carlo Ancelotti, the midfielder, however, has been forced to settle for Castilla football.\n\nTo his credit, though, on Saturday, Reinier took full advantage of his latest chance to impress.\n\nAfforded a starting berth for Raúl’s Castilla outfit in a pre-season meeting with Illescas, the Brazilian proved himself the star of the show.\n\nEn route to a 5-1 Real Madrid triumph, he was on target to the tune of a hat-trick, efforts which will no doubt have been noted by Ancelotti and his coaching staff.\n\nConor Laird | GSFN"
