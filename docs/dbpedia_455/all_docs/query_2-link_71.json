        "text": "AC Milan ended their US pre-season tour with a penalty shoot-out win as the game against Barcelona ended 2-2 after 90 minutes. In front of his home crowd, Christian Pulisic got a 1+1 and below are the player ratings for the Rossoneri.\n\nIf you haven’t already, make sure to check out how we decide the player ratings. From the scale to what affects the rating, we have compiled everything there.\n\nStarting XI\n\nTorriani (7): The youngster made three great saves in the first half, two on Raphinha and one on Lewandowski from close range. He had some good interventions in the second half as well but could have been a lot better with his feet, struggling at times. On the other hand, he saved two penalties in the shoot-out (including the decisive one) and deserves praise for that.\n\nSaelemaekers (5.5): Although that was perhaps expected, he wasn’t good enough in the defensive phase and struggled above all with the positioning. He was too high up the pitch several times and he had a poor clearance just before Barca’s first goal. In the second half, he played on the left flank of the attack but didn’t have much success there either.\n\nTomori (5.5): The Englishman struggled with his positioning throughout the game, even if he had a couple of good clearances. One could argue that the defence was left too exposed (same old story), but the feeling is that both centre-backs could have done better.\n\nThiaw (5.5): He wasn’t aligned with his teammates on the second goal, resulting in the Barcelona man being onside. Just like his colleague, he seemed to struggle with the runs in behind and his defending on the first goal also left a lot to be desired.\n\nTerracciano (5): It wasn’t a good US tour for him, unfortunately, failing to show anything of value in both phases of the game. Tonight, he struggled defensively and when he got forward, the combination with his teammates was abysmal.,\n\nMusah (6): The American had some good runs forward, including one just before the first goal, and he was also okay in his defensive movements. It will be interesting to see him when he has had some more time with Fonseca.\n\nLoftus-Cheek (6.5): Physically imposing and good with the ball at his feet. He drifted out of the game every now and then, but it was still a good display from the Englishman who showcased his versatility.\n\nChukwueze (6): He was involved in the first goal with a nice lay-off to Pulisic, very similar to Leao’s pass for ditto, and he was lively overall. However, he missed quite a good chance in the first half after doing well to get past his man.\n\nPulisic (7 – MOTM): Captain America bagged a good assist for the first goal, although he was given way too much time by the Barca defence, and the finish on his own goal was brilliant. Okay in open play aside from this, so a promising display in the No.10 role.\n\nLeao (6): He was dominant against his opponent on the left flank and had several great runs forward, but the end product was lacking. Aside from the assist for Pulisic, he could have done a lot better with his passing.\n\nJovic (6.5): It was great work for him to wrestle past his opponent on the first goal, slotting it home from close range, but he could have been more involved in open play in general.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nCalabria (6): Defended very well during his time on the pitch and you could clearly see the difference compared to the first half. Converted his penalty very nicely as well.\n\nBennacer (6): He added some defensive balance to Milan’s game and had some nice tackles out there. His penalty was saved in the shoot-out, it should be noted.\n\nAdli (6): The Frenchman did just about enough to get a pass here, showcasing some skill as well as moving up and down the pitch with willingness. He also converted his penalty.\n\nOkafor (6): Always tried to make something happen and had a few good runs up the pitch, though with little support from his teammates. He slotted home his penalty with ease.\n\nJimenez (N/A): We didn’t see enough of him to give a rating.\n\nGabbia (N/A): We didn’t see enough of him to give a rating.\n\nCuenca (N/A): We didn’t see enough of him to give a rating.\n\nKalulu (N/A): We didn’t see enough of him to give a rating. He absolutely skied his penalty."
