        "text": "Q: \"What was it like to take to the pitch with your presents here today\"?\n\nA: Renier is overcome with emotion talking about his parents... \"My family have done so much for me and all my success is thanks to them\"\n\nQ: \"Have you been made aware of the pressure of playing for Real Madrid?\"\n\nA: \"This is the biggest club in the world and I'm prepared to do my all to play for the club\".\n\nQ: \"The president stated that Zidane was a boyhood of yours\". What RM team really won you over?\n\nA: \"My dad has shown me various videos of Real Madrid games over the years and I like the side with Cristiano\".\n\nQ: \"How did you feel when you discovered Real Madrid were interested in signing you\"?\n\nA: \"It was incredible, my dad told me the news and it was an amazing feeling. Madrid have been a club I've followed since I was a kid\".\n\nQ: \"How do you feel about going from Flamengo to going to play in the third tier of Spain in 2B?\n\nA: \"It will be a privilege to play under Raul, he gave me a warm welcome and wished me all the best and I'll give my all for every aspect of this club\"\n\nQ: \"What have the other Brazilians (Rodrygo, Vinicius) told you by way of advice\"\n\nA: \"I hope the all offer me plenty of support, Vinicius is a childhood friend of mine and I was in his house the other day\".\n\nPositive reaction from RM fans around the world to the signing. Reinier certainly has bags of promise and from what we've seen from his time with Flamengo and the Brazil U-23 side, a fine talent in the making.\n\nSpeculation about how Reinier will perform on some of the more rugged 2B grass pitches in the north of Spain where high rainfall levels lead to some pretty boggy pitches. Real Madrid Castilla's recent away game in Langreo (Asturias) being a case in point.\n\nThe player's father watches on with a glowing beam of pride as his son poses for pictures on the pitch, he then embraces his family before being ushered off for a quick change and return to the press room where he will field questions from the media.\n\nThe traditional keepie uppie exhibition from the new signing as the Real Madrid anthem sounds from the PA system. The player now kicks a few club balls as gifts to the numerous fans who have arrived to see the player being unveiled.\n\nAhead of Reinier's arrival, his dad Mauro shows us few tricks with the former fut-sal player having played previously in Spain at a high level.\n\nReinier is on the Bernabeu pitch.....A nervous anticipation visible on the young player's face.\n\nReal Madrid Castilla will certainly welcome the midfielder with open arms as Raul's side languish in mid table in Group I of the third tier Segunda B division. The team are currently six points off a play-off place with 11 games of the regular season to go.\n\nThe Brazilian will now don the famous white kit and take his place on the Santiago Bernabéu turf where a number of fans have turned out to see the new signing in action.\n\n....now it's the turn of the Brazilian who starts speaking in Spanish...\n\n...just a few words from the teenager, thanking Florentino Perez for the privilege of being able to play for the club and ending his very, very few words with the traditional \"Hala Madrid\".\n\nThe player now poses with a club shirt and his family as the assembled camera men capture the moment.\n\nFlorentino Perez: \"Welcome Reinier, you're now a player with the club that you used to select when playing video games\". You are here on merit, you made your debut at the age of 16 and have won titles with Flamengo\".\n\n\"Congratulations and welcome Reinier and we wish you every success with the Real Madrid shirt, this club is now your home\".\n\nNext up, words from president Florentino Perez:\n\n\"Real Madrid are building a new stadium for the future and our vision for the future doesn't stop at the ground. We're also looking for the best global talent and are hoping to win LaLiga and the Champions\"\n\n\" Real Madrid will never tire to look for the best new talents from around the world\"\n\nThe plan is for both the president and player to speak to the media in the press room. Reinier will then take to the Santiago Bernabéu pitch and offer the world the first glimpse of the player donning the famous white kit.\n\nThe Brazilian was recently in action for his U-23 side in the Pre-Olympic qualifying campaign with both Argentina and Brazil progressing for the CONMEBOL group and Reinier travelled to the Spanish capital last Sunday."
