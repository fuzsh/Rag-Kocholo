        "text": "Swaminathan Nanda-Kishore\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n16 min read\n\n·\n\nJan 6, 2019\n\n--\n\nDo you want to run a long-term Real Madrid career save? Be warned that the ‘galactico’ experiment has a very low success rate. It’s statistically proven and more realistic to develop young talent. After running countless saves since FM15 and keenly watching Real Madrid’s B team (Castilla) and Real Madrid’s U19 squad (Juvenil) on Real Madrid TV, I’ve developed a guide on how to best utilise your youngsters.\n\nSo firstly, by ‘youngster’, I mean a player who is 23 years or younger when you start the save. That implies Mariano makes the cut since he is born on August 1st but Kovacic misses out due to being born on May 14th.\n\nSecondly, all players on the books of Real Madrid have been included, the B-Team, U19 Team, First Team as well as those loaned out.\n\nFor easy readability, I have selected the 20 best players and graded them from gold to bronze in order of their importance.\n\nIf I missed out anyone or if you some points to add, please do let me know, you can contact me on my Twitter (nandy_sushruta).\n\nGold\n\nAlvaro Odriozola\n\nWhile your analyst might think Odriozola can only be 3.5 rating for the team in the future, which is less than Carvajal, I’d beg to differ. With the right training regimen and the correct utilization, Odriozola could become as good, if not better than Carvajal. Look at their current stats, within 3 seasons or less, Alvaro should become your first choice right-back.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nWith Carvajal suffering some niggles in the first half of the 2018/19 season, you can rack up a good string of games early on. Make sure you give Odriozola at least 20 starts every season until he demands a new contract somewhere in the late 2019/20 or the early 2020/21 season.\n\nOdriozola is perfect at the wing-back position, both on support and attack roles. But do remember to let him dribble more, cross more often and get further forward along with running wide with the ball. His incredible pace creates space and great shooting opportunities for Bale and Asensio (My RWF(Inside forward) and CAM(shadow striker) who switch sometimes during the game).\n\nOdriozola usually asks for quickness training, however, once that is done, make sure you put him on an individual regime for crossing or dribbling. Later on, his career, make sure he improves his passing and decisions to be able to play as a complete wing-back.\n\nJesus Vallejo\n\nReal Madrid’s defensive depth is appalling. Sergio Ramos is ageing, Varane is extremely keen to leave the club (Best case scenario is that you sign a promise stating that he will leave only if a minimum bid comes in), Vallejo is injury prone and the only decent left-back at the club is Marcelo, if you use Nacho to give Marcelo rest than you’ll have to depend on Castilla players about 4–5 times in the season for centre-back coverage.\n\nHaving said that, they are three ways in which managers could deal with this\n\nBuy a world-class CB and have Nacho be a backup left-back with Vallejo as the fourth choice\n\nBuy a backup CB and have Nacho be a backup left-back and let Vallejo and the new signing compete for playing time\n\nBuy a backup LB and have Nacho as a backup CB and Vallejo as the fourth choice.\n\nVallejo won’t be better than Ramos or Varane but he does occasionally come close to being as good as Ramos, just a bit quicker with lesser aerial prowess.\n\nIf you’re resigned to the fact that his injuries will be a deterrent and he will never be a big-name player at Madrid, here are my suggestions:\n\nBuy Virgil Van Dyk or any other big name centre-back who is quick and good with the ball if Varane chooses to leave.\n\nIf Varane doesn’t leave, then purchase a big-name centre-back who has incredible positioning among other attributes you desire in a more traditional centre-back to directly replace Ramos either at the start of the 2020/21 or the 2021/22 campaign.\n\nIf you’re like me and expect Vallejo to be a key player in the future, then here’s what you should do\n\nVallejo will improve on his defending. However, make sure he gets his pace up to a respectable level before you trust him with the starting spot. Additional focus on quickness training is a must for the first season.\n\nSend him on a leadership course in the off-season with the goal for him becoming a club captain by 2027 or later.\n\nNever play him for more than 2 games a week. It’s a massive risk considering his injury-prone nature.\n\nDani Ceballos\n\nDani Ceballos is now the third-choice CM after Kovacic’s departure. You should definitely bring Kovacic back in your second season but just sit back and enjoy Dani Ceballos being a baller for the first season.\n\nDo train him as an attacking midfielder, with additional focus on flair or any other attribute you think he lacks to be your team’s AM. I usually play Gareth Bale or Asensio as the shadow striker, but having a player who can slot in central and attacking midfield is always great.\n\nIf you find it difficult to give him regular game-time once Kovacic returns in his second season, I’d suggest sending him on a loan that winter or the next summer as he will by then have become a 3 star player for the team and you need to give him playing time.\n\nMarcos Llorente\n\nA great player who could be the answer to our search for the next Xabi Alonso.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nUnless, you’re planning to cash in on Casemiro early or if you’re playing Kroos as a regista, loan him out to any La Liga club where he can get playing time. It’s always about getting the balance right, Real Sociedad will give him ample game time but he won’t train well there. Similarly, Atletico Madrid will give him great training facilities, but he will not be able to displace Thomas Partey and Rodri for playing time.\n\nMake sure you can recall him from his loan anytime.\n\nIf you do keep him, you could train him as a Carrilero with additional focus on off-ball movement.\n\nMarco Asensio\n\nUndoubtedly the best talent at the club. Be very careful with this guy, your handling of him will impact your club’s success to a large extent.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nThe guy can play anywhere, but that’s a double-edged sword, play him on the left flank, and his finishing is not fully utilized. Play him as a second striker, you aren’t using his long shots and vision to great effect. Play him as a CM and he’s too far away from the goal. I’ve found that the best way to use him is to put him at the AMF spot as a shadow striker/ attacking midfielder and have him swap positions with Bale(or Sane 5 seasons later) who plays at as an inside forward on the RWF position\n\nYou might need to retrain Isco as a CM or a false-9 in order to accommodate this, but in the long run, it’s probably the best bet to build the team around Asensio.\n\nVinicius Junior\n\nOne of the reasons I’m completely against the purchase of Hazard is that it forces him to play for Castilla and that somewhat stagnates his development. If this guy is dealt with perfectly, he can become the next Ronaldo(according to FM as he has a 5-star potential). While you should not build your team around Vinny, there is a good chance he will be the team’s best player in terms of individual impact.\n\nHere is a picture from the best half-season he’s had on the game. Observe how his stat radial graph is very similar to that of Ronaldo’s i.e. the polygon created by FM to show skill distribution for Ronaldo and Vinicius has a similar shape (except for heading).\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nYou should reserve the left-flank for Vinicius Jr. Let him start as much as possible for the next 2 seasons because, after that, it would be criminal to not have him start.\n\nOne way to accommodate him in the squad is to sell Lucas Vazquez and let Gareth Bale own the right flank while Vinny can do his thing on the left.\n\nBe careful with training, don’t overtrain him as he already puts in a large amount of work in the first place due to his driven personality.\n\nRodrygo Goes\n\nRodrygo is a versatile forward with a very diverse skill set. Along with Lautaro Martinez, he has the best chance to become a player very similar to Ronaldo Nazario.\n\nHis stats start to look like this within 4 seasons\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nWhile most prefer to use him as a winger and Vinicius as the striker, I choose to do the opposite, I start giving him games as a striker early and his 16–17 finishing along with 17 off the ball movement really helps.\n\nHis best position is complete forward, but make sure you train him on his work-rate if you run a gegenpress tactic as it is his only poor trait. By 2025, his work-rate touches 13–14 and he is one of the best players at the club.\n\nAnd yes, I tend to ignore the conventional wisdom to play him as a lone striker. But, if your team is heavily dependent on crossing, I would suggest playing him as a secondary striker.\n\nSilver\n\nAndriy Lunin\n\nIn almost all of my saves, he doesn’t make more than 3 league starts by December. However, he does start every single Cup game. This is mainly due to the presence of Ivan Cuellar. This is true in real life as well, it’s just close to impossible for Lunin to break into the team.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nI would actually recommend keeping Lunin at Leganes for the next 7–8 years if possible. Leganes actually have 12/18 training facilities and Lunin is guaranteed starter as early as the 2019/20 season.\n\nIf 12/18 training seems to low for you, you could always try a club like Villareal with 14/18 training after his first season of loan at Leganes, but he will face harder competition in Sergio Asenjo.\n\nShady Tip: You could try to buy Sergio Asenjo for 12–15 M in the 2019/20 season and sell him to another club for a small loss the following year, keep Lunin at Villarreal for 6–7 seasons. By then you can either bring Lunin back as a first team member or sell him for a massive profit.\n\nLunin can grow to be anywhere from Kiko Casilla level to as good as David De Gea, but he usually ends up being almost as good as Courtois is to start the game and can become a key player for you in the late 2020s.\n\nTheo Hernández\n\nYour future first team left-back, and considering how good Marcelo is and will be for a few seasons, you don’t need to hurry and bring this guy back since he gets a lot of games at Real Sociedad. (Real San Sebastian)\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nThe game does not allow him to be a bad player as he is one of the most complete players who is a natural at left-back. Such players are great on FM.\n\nYou should bring him back as soon as you see signs of Marcelo’s age affecting him, but be wary that he could throw a tantrum to leave the club. After all, FM’s true full-name is French players betraying Managers 2019.\n\nJokes apart, you could bring him back really early and try to re-train him as a left-winger. He is stylistically very similar to Gareth Bale. Vinicius Jr’s presence does make it tough for you to see significant game time and therefore improvement in his ability to play as a winger, but it it is worth the effort.\n\nAchraf Hakimi\n\nHe initially struggles to break into the first team but displaces first choice RB, Lukasz Piszczek as early as February, who retires at the end of the season regardless.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nAchraf doesn’t have a future as a key player in Madrid due to Odriozola’s massive potential.\n\nI would recommend making him available for loan for many years and then sell around the 30M mark, remember to attach a buyback clause if you do sell him.\n\nFor those who keep him, it will be due to his versatility and low side-preference while playing full-back. Train him at the LB spot and give him regular games so he can somewhat be like what Nacho Fernandez is right now.\n\nMartin Ødegaard\n\nArguably the best player who is on loan from the club. He performs the best, but we must remember he’s playing in the Switzerland league with Vitesse. He’s usually deployed at the right wing and AM position.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nHis 5 finishing should tell you that he is not going to play well as a wide forward as most modern formations require the wide players to score goals. You should only play him at the attacking midfielder position.\n\nLuckily, he masks his 5 finishing with the player trait of looking to pass before shooting.\n\nHis 17 passing,17 dribbling, 17 first touch,17 first touch and 16 technique implies that he is perfectly made for the AM role.\n\nYou could try to re-train him as a central midfielder but make sure he’s paired with a physically more dominant to mask his deficiencies.\n\nFederico Valverde\n\nHe is the 3rd choice DM and the 4th choice CM this season. Please don’t do what Madrid are doing with him in real life\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nSending him to Castilla will not help your Castilla players develop.\n\nHe is extremely well rounded but does not have any one skill in which he excels.\n\nYou should loan him despite his versatility and in fact, I would make him available for many years. Once Kovacic is back, he would struggle to get game time at the club.\n\nIn some saves, if you train him well, he could directly replace Kroos as your team’s deep-lying playmaker. But that’s a bit unlikely.\n\nI usually loan him to a Spanish outfit where he gets good game time like Girona where he develops a good relationship with Alex Granell and fellow Uruguayan forward Stuani.\n\nSergio Reguilon\n\nGood left-back at the club who would be a capable backup behind Theo in the future.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\n14 crossing and 14 work rate are his best attributes.\n\nHe isn’t good enough to be Madrid’s backup left-back just yet. I usually recommend buying former Madrid player, Mario Hermoso, who can play left back and centre back.\n\nI would recommend sending him to Castilla for a season or two before loaning him and bringing him back.\n\nGood fullbacks are rare on this game, so make sure you don’t sell him cheap if you do sell him.\n\nMariano Diaz\n\nMore often than not, he ends up being the second highest scorer on your team (behind Bale/ any other big name you bring in). For me, in his best save, he scored 11 goals until December (after which I bought Iago Aspas), with a goal every 98 minutes.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nIf you choose to play him as a lone striker, then play him as a target man. His 17 heading helps.\n\nThe best way to play him is to pair him with another striker, either Benzema or Kane (if you buy Kane/Lewandowski or any other big name frontman, it’s essential you sell Benzema) His poacher instincts are incredible with 17 bravery and 17 finishing ensuring that he will score at least 15 goals a season as a poacher.\n\nAnother way to play him is the pressing forward (formerly known as defensive forward) where his 17 work-rate doesn’t allow teams to control possession and make a come-back into the game. I bring him on the pitch (70–75th minute along with Casemiro) to kill the game.\n\nBronze\n\nRaul De Tomas\n\nThe game has given him 15 finishing and 14 composure which means he is great in front of goal. He definitely has the potential to be a starting striker for most clubs barring the top few. He single-handedly drags Rayo Vallecano out of the relegation zone many times.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nI’d suggest keeping him at Rayo for a few seasons before you can command a double-digit transfer fee for him.\n\nRemember, a 20 M buy-back clause always helps. The wages are crazy on this game and the only way to stay financially healthy in the long run with these crazy contracts handed out to your star players is to have these little tricks in your bag. Remember Omar Mascarell, we bought him from Frankfurt just to sell him back for a small profit.\n\nBorja Mayoral\n\nHe actually scores 15 odd goals in his first season out on loan. He has a few promising attributes like his 15 first touch and 13 dribbling\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nTactically, he’s a more technically gifted version of Raul De Tomas but less of a pure goal scorer, despite this he usually scores more than RDT during the first few seasons due to being in a better team. You could bring him as a backup for a season.\n\nUnfortunately, just like RDT and with Rodrygo just being a one in a million talent, Borja rarely ends up as Real Madrid’s main striker.\n\nI would suggest loaning him for 3–4 seasons until you can expect a good bid to come in.\n\nMiguel Baeza\n\nBaeza is the youth player with the highest potential on this game. He can play anywhere in the front three as well as a central midfielder. In the save I ran parallelly to writing this article, he defied all expectations. Just look at his stats, and I have only run this save till December.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nIf you choose to keep him in the U-19 team and surround him with the right players and employ the right tactics, Baeza has an incredible first season where he shatters all records. He scores and assists close to 50 goals every time.\n\nHe may be occasionally used as a right winger, but his best position is the half winger or the ‘mezzala’. This is a position he excels in later on in his career for the first team.\n\nI would suggest letting him enjoy the first season as a u-19 player and then move him on to the Castilla team for at least two seasons before sending him on an extended loan spell.\n\nThis guy has immense potential, so I recommend setting personalised training sessions for him from the beginning. You must have an option to terminate the loan to any club you send him to.\n\nRodrigo Rodrigues\n\nNot to be confused with Rodrygo Goes, Rodrigo is an attacking midfielder who also has a great season with the Real Madrid U19 team.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nAs an attacking midfielder, you might be surprised that he ends up as your top scorer in 90% of your saves, but that’s just how good he is. In fact, he’s the polar opposite to Odegaard(on the game) with great finishing but low playmaking ability(compared to Odegaard).\n\nYou must ensure he spends a little bit longer in the Castilla set-up. He might start getting interested earlier than his team-mates but as a foreigner, I would prefer to keep him for an extra season in the B team before sending him on loan.\n\nIn the mid-2020s, you have to take a call on whether you are going to have him or Odegaard return to be a key Madrid cog. I usually choose Odegaard, but it’s completely understandable to choose Rodrigo.\n\nLuca Zidane\n\nUnlike real life, Luca Zidane is the best Real Madrid youth goalkeeper in the game. He has stats that you would not expect to see in a traditional keeper.\n\nSuggested Plan of action:\n\nWith 14 passing, 14 paces, 15 decisions and 15 acceleration among others, Luca Zidane is a different keeper, one that I haven’t seen very often. Which also means that he is a natural sweeper keeper and you should only play him at that position.\n\nIf you really want Luca to develop into a great keeper, I’d suggest playing a gegenpress tactic and change your settings such that your B team and youth teams follow the same tactics. Gegenpress tactics require a sweeper-keeper with good physical traits and Luca Zidane is perfect for that.\n\nI will say that Zidane will not be anywhere as good as Courtois is and his potential is much less than that of Lunin’s. You’re better of selling him after a few seasons with a buy-back clause.\n\nJavi Sanchez\n\nThe captain of the B team in real life, unlike the game where Manu Hernando is the captain. In my saves, he develops as a great back-up who stays with the club for a long time. With 16 heading, 15 jumping reach and 189 cm height, he grows in a half-decent centre-back who is the second biggest threat in the world from set-pieces (after Sule)\n\nDon’t loan him out for more than a year. I suggest loaning Gorka Zabarte out if Javi Sanchez doesn’t get game-time.\n\nI definitely missed out a few names that you might be familiar with if you are a regular in running saves with Madrid. They include Martin Calderon, Aleix Febas, Cristo and Manu Hernando among the many others. I chose the 20 youngsters that most appealed to me and impressed me in almost every save if that seems fair enough\n\nThis is how your team could look like in the future"
