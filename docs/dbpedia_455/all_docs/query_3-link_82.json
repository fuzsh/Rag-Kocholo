        "text": "Australian Cameron Davis won the 2024 Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit as English golfer Aaron Rai's challenge faltered in the final round.\n\nRai, looking for his first win on the PGA Tour, had a share of the lead with American Akshay Bhatia heading into the last day. But the 29-year-old shot 72, including three bogeys in a six-hole stretch, as he finished a shot behind Davis.\n\nRai, a two-time winner on the DP Tour, finished tied for second after his even-par final round, but it represents his best result on the PGA Tour.\n\nPlayer Profile\n\nKey Stats\n\nWhat's In The Bag\n\nDavis was warming up for a potential play-off with Bhatia after he finished with an 18-under 270 at Detroit Golf Club's North course. However, Bhatia, in the last grouping with Rai, missed a four-foot putt on the final hole to hand Davis a second PGA Tour title.\n\nHe said: \"From where I was a couple of weeks ago to today, it's just completely different. I'm a little emotional actually. I wouldn't wish what happened to Akshay on the last on anyone but I've done a lot of grinding to try and get myself out of a hole and to just all of a sudden do that, it's pretty good.\n\n\"I've got so many people behind me that have helped me along the way. I had a lot of support to kind of get me out of the doldrums there. I saw a little bit of a spark last week but nothing to show this coming so this is great.\"\n\nPlayer Profile\n\nDavis was born in Sydney on February 21, 1995.\n\nHe had a successful amateur career. In 2015 he won the Australian Amateur and was a runner-up in the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship. In 2016 he was part of the Australian team who won the Eisenhower Trophy in Mexico and he was also the individual winner. The Australian team won the team event by 19 strokes and Davis finished two ahead of teammate Curtis Luck in the individual event.\n\nDavis turned professional in late 2016. He qualified for the 2017 PGA Tour Canada by finishing fourth in the Q-school.

He also had status on the Web.com Tour for 2018 after reaching the final round of Q School. Davis won the 2018 Nashville Open and finished 7th on the Web.com Tour money list to secure his PGA Tour card.\n\nHe struggled during the 2018-2019 PGA Tour season, and finished 160th in the FedEx Cup points list. However, he rebounded and finished 84th during the 2019â€“20 season.\n\nIn July 2021, Davis earned his first PGA Tour victory by defeating Troy Merritt and Joaquin Niemann in a playoff at the Rocket Mortgage Classic and ended the year 37th on the FedEx Cup points list.\n\nIn September 2022, He was selected for the International team for the Presidents Cup.
