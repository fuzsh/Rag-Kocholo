        "text": "After months of rumors, whispers, leaks, competing insiders and more, Atlético Madrid have finally put the pedal to the metal and plunged headlong into backing up four-month-old talk of a summer “revolution” in Diego Simeone’s playing squad. Atlético have cleared significant room on the wage bill after announcing seven departures from the 2023/24 squad and now appear to be working on several new signings, less than two weeks before the start of the 2024/25 league season.\n\nAtlético on Saturday announced Robin Le Normand’s arrival from Real Sociedad, with the Spain center-back signing a five-year contract and becoming the most expensive defender (€34.5 million plus bonuses) in club history. Atleti completed the Alexander Sørloth signing later that day, acquiring the Villarreal forward for a €30 million initial fee and inking him to a four-year contract. To date, those are the only arrivals the club has confirmed this summer, but it seems like more are on the way — and soon.\n\nJulián Álvarez/Samu Omorodion\n\nLet’s start with Julián Álvarez, an “operation” that we first heard about in June. Following Argentina’s exit from the Summer Olympic Games, negotiations for Álvarez have accelerated rapidly — to the point where Argentine outlet Diario Olé is taking it for granted that in the coming days, the World Cup winner will join Atlético in a €75 million transfer (potentially reaching €90 million). That would be the largest fee spent in LALIGA this summer, a record sale for Manchester City, and the second most-expensive incoming transfer in Atleti’s history.\n\nÁlvarez’s will and desire to come to Atlético are proving decisive in the club’s negotiations with Man City. Off the pitch, Álvarez’s family has been planning to relocate to Madrid upon the expiration of their United Kingdom residency permits, and on it, the player was upset at the quality of his minutes under Pep Guardiola last season — paving the way for a move from the rain of Manchester to the sun of Madrid.\n\nThese factors have given Atlético a rare opportunity to acquire a genuine star, in a league where players of this caliber tend to go to Barcelona or to Real Madrid. Álvarez can lead a frontline or situate himself behind it, and his trophy cabinet at 24 years old includes two Copa América titles, two Premier League crowns, and the UEFA Champions League in 2023.\n\nIf the clubs reach an agreement on a fee for him, Álvarez will officially sign a five-year contract with Atlético in which — crucially — he will keep his Man City wage package while retaining 100 percent of his image rights (City granted him 75 percent after signing him from River Plate). Negotiations are at a point where top executives Miguel Ángel Gil Marín and Ferran Soriano are leading the talks.\n\nHowever, another domino has to fall before Atlético can welcome Álvarez and give Cholo Simeone his “dream signing.” Atlético have indeed decided to cash in on promising Samu Omorodion, and the club expects to finalize the Spain under-23 striker’s transfer to Chelsea this week for at least €40 million (not coincidentally the same price Atleti are set to pay for Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher — more on that below). The message is clear: if Samu goes, Julián comes. If Julián doesn’t come, the Samu and Gallagher deals could fall apart.\n\nI am a big Samu fan. He possesses the brawn, speed, strength, and feel for the position that today’s elite center-forwards have. The 20-year-old’s finishing and composure around goal need improvement (he underperformed his xG by 2.5 goals at Alavés and Granada), but I am fairly confident that Samu will be a high-level forward someday. It is disappointing that we won’t get to see him develop at Atlético, because I think Simeone would work wonders with him, and I don’t like that the club is treating him as an asset when he has spoken of his desire to succeed in Madrid.\n\nBut this is the cost of doing business. I think in this context, if it means a realistic chance of bringing Álvarez, the choice is relatively clear — especially without a clear buyer for the €60 million-rated João Félix.\n\nConor Gallagher/Javi Guerra\n\nReportedly tired of waiting several days for Gallagher to accept terms, Gil Marín spoke directly to Valencia counterpart Peter Lim on Saturday to cement an agreement for Los Che’s ridiculously-talented midfielder Javi Guerra. That agreement, centered on a €25 million package not including €5 million in bonuses, would bring the versatile 21-year-old to Madrid — where his vision, athletic stride, and shot from distance can complement any of Koke, de Paul, or Pablo Barrios.\n\nBut Gallagher finally accepted Atlético’s contract offer at 4 a.m. Spanish time on Monday morning, apparently beating the club’s imposed deadline by one whole minute. The England international — a 24-year-old pressing machine with a direct, swashbuckling playing style — has agreed to a five-year contract and is set to fly to Spain on Tuesday to complete his €40 million transfer. This creates a conundrum for the club, which had been preparing to welcome Guerra to Madrid this week. Girona, which can also offer Champions League football next season, would be the player’s other potential landing spot.\n\nIf Atlético were to sign both midfielders (seeing as the respective deals are each very advanced), the club would have to sort out another exit in the midfield to make room. If this happens, I feel the most likely candidates to leave would be Thomas Lemar and Arthur Vermeeren — the former without a nailed-down place in Simeone’s midfield following his injury-wracked 2023/24 campaign, the latter in need of consistent minutes and development time even after his display against Getafe in Saturday’s friendly.\n\nI’d also watch for developments around Rodrigo Riquelme. He looks likely to be a squad player again this season and, as a homegrown talent, would represent a pure profit should he be sold.\n\nAymeric Laporte\n\nI feel like this one is not as much of a priority for Atlético at the moment, given that Le Normand has signed and Simeone is pondering whether to keep Atleti B center-back Ilias Kostis in the first team as an in-house Mario Hermoso replacement. But here is European Championship-winning center-back Laporte anyway, looking for a new home after an unhappy season at Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr.\n\nLaporte is apparently the alternative to Feyenoord/Slovakia defender David Hancko, who has been left frustrated after the Dutch club rejected three separate bids from Atlético — all of which were below the player’s market value and eventually drew the ire of the Dutch media. Laporte’s stock rose significantly following an excellent European Championship with Spain, and a return to Athletic Club doesn’t seem to be on the table for him.\n\nAt 30, Laporte would be Atlético’s oldest signing of the summer and would not exactly align with a long-term project. He also has a checkered injury history, with multiple knee injuries on his record. However, center-back aging curves are weird, and Laporte could easily produce a few more good seasons back in the Spanish league. His height, strength, and elegant passing would all be welcome attributes to Atleti’s defense, allowing Simeone to maintain the 3-5-2 formation."
