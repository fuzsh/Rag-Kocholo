        "text": "HyperMotionV\n\nHyperMotionV [PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC]\n\nDriving the biggest leap forward in gameplay authenticity and realism to date, HyperMotionV translates the rhythm and fluidity of real-world football into The World’s Game using volumetric data of more than 180 top-tier matches from competitions like the UEFA Men’s and Women’s Champions League, Premier League and LaLiga EA SPORTS. This means that movement in EA SPORTS FC™ 24 comes from teams like Real Madrid, PSG, and Manchester City and that the animations of hundreds of in-game players are influenced by actions of real-world professionals on the pitch.\n\nAdvanced 11v11 Match Capture and Machine Learning combine to bring HyperMotionV to life:\n\nAdvanced 11v11 Match Capture [PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC]\n\nVolumetric data helps to power HyperMotionV—full teams playing full matches in the top competitions around the world, captured live by a bank of cameras around the stadiums, meaning data from players influence how they move in-game.\n\nMachine Learning [PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC]\n\nUsing Advanced 11v11 Match Capture data HyperMotionV teaches the EA SPORTS FC™ proprietary machine learning algorithm how to recreate true-to-football motion, even in real time to make The World’s Game feel immersive and unique.\n\nIn EA SPORTS FC™ 24, we used machine learning to enhance the movement between Technical Dribble touches and to evolve the ML-Flow feature.\n\nHyperMotionV gameplay technology unlocks the following features in EA SPORTS FC™ 24:\n\nFull Team Volumetric Motion [PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC]\n\nHyperMotionV volumetric data powers authentic 11v11 movement by capturing all 22 players at once in real competitive matches. The result is over 11,000 true-to-football animations, nearly twice as many as last year, so that both squads move like the top clubs in the world—as a team.\n\nAI Mimic [PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC]\n\nAI Mimic takes footballers’ real-world volumetric data and uses advanced artificial intelligence to recreate unique body movements live in EA SPORTS FC™ 24, allowing fans to experience Haaland’s signature running style—plus 1,200 more of the best footballers in The World’s Game.\n\nAcceleRATE 2.0 [PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC]\n\nAcceleRATE 2.0 significantly expands our AcceleRATE feature, dividing our player movement system into more unique archetypes. This allows us to showcase more granular personalities in player acceleration and further improve the viability of different player types in EA SPORTS FC™ 24.\n\nA quick refresher on the base Acceleration Types:\n\nControlled: Most players in EA SPORTS FC™ 24 will fall into the basic Controlled type, as they accelerate in a more balanced and controlled manner.\n\nExplosive: Shorter and more agile players who are quicker to start, but their acceleration rate slows down after the initial burst of acceleration.\n\nLengthy: Taller and stronger players that start slow but thrive over longer distances once they get going.\n\nIn EA SPORTS FC™ 24, we are introducing four new acceleration archetypes to represent more players’ movement styles:\n\nControlled Explosive - 50% Explosive, 50% Controlled\n\nMostly Explosive - 70% Explosive, 30% Controlled\n\nControlled Lengthy - 50% Lengthy, 50% Controlled\n\nMostly Lengthy - 70% Lengthy, 30% Controlled\n\nAcceleRATE is assigned automatically to players based on a combination of their Acceleration, Height, Agility, and Strength Attributes. That said, Acceleration and Sprint Speed are still the main factors in determining how fast a player is overall.\n\nThis is how the AcceleRATE categories are assigned:\n\nType\n\nHeight\n\nAgility\n\nStrength\n\nAcceleration\n\nAgility vs Strength\n\nDifference\n\nExplosive (Pure)\n\n<= 175 cm (~5’9’’)\n\n[5’9.3 ft / 176.2 cm]\n\n>= 80\n\n—\n\n>= 80\n\n>= 20\n\nMostly Explosive\n\n<= 182 cm (~6’0’’)\n\n[6’0 ft / 183.1 cm]\n\n>= 70\n\n—\n\n>= 80\n\n>= 12\n\nControlled Explosive\n\n<= 182 cm (~6’0’’)\n\n[ 6’0 ft / 183.1 cm]\n\n>= 65\n\n—\n\n>= 70\n\n>= 4\n\nControlled\n\nAny\n\nAny\n\nAny\n\nAny\n\nAny\n\nControlled Lengthy\n\n>= 181 cm (~5’11’’)\n\n[5’11.1 ft / 180.6 cm]\n\n—\n\n>= 65\n\n>= 40\n\n>= 4\n\nMostly Lengthy\n\n>= 183 cm (~6’0’’)\n\n[5’11.8 / 182.57 cm]\n\n—\n\n>= 75\n\n>= 55\n\n>= 12\n\nLengthy (Pure)\n\n>= 188 cm (~6’2’’)\n\n[6’1.8 ft / 187.45 cm]\n\n—\n\n>= 80\n\n>= 55\n\n>= 20\n\nKinetic Physical Play\n\nKinetic Shielding [PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC]\n\nUtilising the same technology as Kinetic Air Battles, these new 2-players shielding animations provide more authentic battles over a ball when a player is attempting to shield their opponent.\n\nShield Pushbacks - Allow you to create space from your opponents by pushing them away from the ball\n\nPress L2 || LT to request a Shield Pushback\n\nPushbacks are more effective the higher the difference in Strength between the shielder and the player they are attempting to push\n\nShielding when holding L2 || LT\n\nThe effectiveness of the shielder is reduced the longer the Shield button is held.\n\nThe stronger the player, the longer they can shield effectively.\n\nThe impact of Attributes in the Shielding mechanic has been increased, with Strength having the biggest impact.\n\nImprovements have been made to the shielding system, including shielding effectiveness, shielder strength, and interactions.\n\nAI True Flight Ball Physics\n\nArtificial intelligence powers AI True Flight Ball Physics, studying hundreds of real-world passes, shots, free-kicks, and crosses and tuning them to make the ball dip, swerve, and soar in EA SPORTS FC™ 24 the same way it does when kicked by some of the best players in football.\n\nAI Hands\n\nStretchSense gloves capture natural hand movements at a new level of detail and pass that data to AI to generate on-the-go hand motions that mirror how hands, wrist, and fingers move when footballers play The World’s Game.\n\nAttacking\n\nPassing\n\nPassing provides new tools for you to bring out your inner world-class passer. New features such as Precision Passing, Swerve On Demand, and Headers On Demand are just some of the mechanics that give you more control over your desired outcome.\n\nPrecision Passing\n\nPrecision Pass allows you to bend and shape the perfect pass with manual precision. This skill-based passing mechanic respects your accuracy when aiming at a target location. The player receiving a Precision Pass will attempt to move toward the ball’s destination.\n\nTo perform a Precision Pass, you have a few options:\n\nPress R1 + ▲ || RB + Y for a Precision Ground Pass\n\nCan be modified to add Swerve with L2 || LT (More info below)\n\nPress R1 + ■ || RB + X for a Precision Lob Pass\n\nThis new mechanic introduces more skill to passes and is designed so that players who can carve out their own space and aim precisely are rewarded for it.\n\nThe following attributes are the ones that matter most when attempting a Precision Pass:\n\nLong Passing and Short Passing, with Vision and Composure contributing to a lesser extent, Curve for Swerve attempts.\n\nThese attributes increase Precision Lob Passes' accuracy and the quality of Precision Ground Passes.\n\nSwerve On Demand\n\nHeaders On Demand\n\nAre you confident that a quick header pass to start a counterattack is the best choice? Now you can request that with Headers On Demand.\n\nTo request a Header On Demand Pass:\n\nPress L2 + R2 + Intended Pass type || LT + RT + Intended Pass type\n\nPlayer will attempt to make a header if the ball is above three feet from the ground.\n\nOther Passing Changes\n\nInput Changes for Passing:\n\nDriven Through Pass has moved to L1 + R1 + ▲|| LB + RB + Y\n\nFrom R1 + ▲|| RB + Y\n\nDriven Lob / Driven Cross has moved to L1 + R1 + ■ || LB + RB + X\n\nFrom R1 + ■ || RB + X\n\nOutside of the Foot Passes:\n\nOnly players with Trivela PlayStyle can perform Outside of the Foot swerving passes contextually.\n\nOutside Of The Foot Passes on Demand (L2 + Pass || LT + Pass) have been replaced with Swerve On Demand.\n\nOutside of the Foot Passes now only use the strong foot of the passer.\n\nThe following commands were removed to make room for our new Precision Passes: Driven Lobbed Through Pass (L1 + R1 + ▲ || LB + RB + Y), High Driven Cross (L1 + R1 + ■ || LB + RB + X).\n\nOther Improvements:\n\nPasses can now be cancelled by performing a variety of Skill Moves.\n\nAdded hundreds of new and refreshed animations for Headers, Jostling Passes, Toe Poke Passes, and Sliding Passes.\n\nControlling the Ball (Dribbling)\n\nA key aspect of football is your mastery of controlling the ball at your feet, so like other aspects of EA SPORTS FC™ 24, we want to give you more control over how you express your footwork.\n\nEffort Dribble Touch\n\nEffort Dribble Touch is a new mechanic in EA SPORTS FC™ 24 that allows you to quickly knock the ball in any direction and set up your next move. This is a great tool for moving the ball out of the path of your opponent’s feet, or to take a defender by surprise with a Controlled First Touch when used as your first touch of the ball.\n\nAn Effort Dribble Touch can be performed while dribbling or as a first touch, making it a versatile attacking weapon.\n\nTo request an Effort Dribble Touch:\n\nPress R1 + Right Stick || RB + Right Stick for an Effort Touch.\n\nA quick flick with the Right Stick will result in a shorter distance knock on the ball while holding Right Stick will knock the ball a greater distance.\n\nEffort Dribble Touch can be used to cancel Passes and Shots.\n\nOrbit Dribble\n\nOrbit Dribble allows you to move around the ball without taking a touch. Use this to adjust your body position and set yourself on your stronger foot for the best shot or pass opportunity. This can also be used to draw in your opponent and combined with Effort Dribble to outmanoeuvre your opponent.\n\nTo perform an Orbit Dribble:\n\nHold L2 + L1 + LS || Hold LT + LB + LS to start moving around the ball.\n\nCan be turned on/off in the settings menu.\n\nControlled Sprint\n\nControlled Sprint introduces a new dribbling speed that is faster than a Jog, but slower than fully Sprinting. Controlled Sprint has more controlled touches, keeping the ball closer to your player.\n\nTo perform Controlled Sprint:\n\nHold R1 || Hold RB.\n\nYour player's Dribble and Sprint Speed attributes will affect your speed and control over the ball.\n\nAdditional Controlling the Ball Changes\n\nBackpedal Traps - Added several new animations with increased directional coverage.\n\nHead Traps - Added multiple new head-controlled Trapping animations.\n\nHeader Accuracy attribute now affects your accuracy and control of Head Traps.\n\nInput changes\n\nAgile Dribble input has been changed to L2 + R2 + LS || LT + RT + LS.\n\nFrom R1 + LS || RB + LS.\n\nSlow Dribble input has been changed to L2 + R1 + LS || LT + RB + LS.\n\nFrom L2 + R2 + LS || LT + RT + LS\n\nShooting\n\nThere are several changes to Shooting this year to improve responsiveness, and adjustments were made to shot assistance types to reward player skill.\n\nPrecision Shooting\n\nFor EA SPORTS FC™ 24, we took all the feedback we received on Semi-Assisted shooting and reworked it into what we now call Precision Shooting. This new shooting type can be enabled in the settings menu under Shot Assistance. As before, our goal is to reward players for their aiming ability with more consistent shot outcomes.\n\nPrecision Shooting consists of three main elements:\n\nAiming Reward - A vital part of the system, where players are rewarded with increased accuracy the closer they aim to the net.\n\nCompared to an Assisted shot in a similar position, the accuracy of a Precision shot will be greatly increased.\n\nAiming Indicator - New aiming indicator under your player. When you take a shot, it helps you understand where you are aiming.\n\nThis indicator can be turned off in the Trainer Visuals options menu.\n\n6-Yard Box Assist - New logic to assist first-time shots near the 6-yard box, so you don’t need to be as precise in the split second you have to get your shot off.\n\nHeaders On Demand\n\nDo you sometimes cross the ball into the box and know that the best choice is to attempt a diving header? Now, as with Passing, you can request that with Headers On Demand for a shot.\n\nTo request a Header On Demand Shot:\n\nPress L2 + R2 + O || LT + RT + B\n\nPlayer will attempt to make a header if the ball is above 3 feet from the ground.\n\nShooting Improvements\n\nQuick Release Shots - When tapping O || B near the goal, your player will attempt to take the shot with the earliest animation possible for a very responsive shot.\n\nPower needs to be below 30% of the bar.\n\nNeeds to be requested within the 18-yard box - anything outside this range will be a Low Shot.\n\nAdvanced Shot Cancels - Shots can now be cancelled with a variety of Skill Moves.\n\nAfter powering up your shot, you have a brief window to use the Right Stick to transition into a Skill Move.\n\nPower Shot transition - You can now transition to a different shot type during the Power Shot animation.\n\nBy pressing L1 || LB, you can transition into a Chip Shot\n\nBy pressing R1 || RB, you can transition into a Finesse Shot\n\nAnimation Refresh\n\nAdded and refreshed new Acrobatic kicks, Headers, Shots from Jostling, Quick Release Shots, and much more.\n\nSkill Moves\n\nWe have added new skill moves to the game and made some changes to existing ones.\n\nNote: The following abbreviations will be used for controls: LS = Left Stick, RS = Right Stick\n\nNew Skill Moves\n\nBall Roll Drag (4 Star)\n\nHold L1 + Flick RS Fwd, Left/Right || Hold LB + Flick RS Fwd, Left/Right\n\nDrag Back Turn (4 Star)\n\nHold L2 + Hold RS Back || Hold LT + Hold RS Back\n\nFlair Nutmegs (4 Star)\n\nHold L1 + R1 + Flick RS Direction || Hold LB + RB + Flick RS Direction\n\nFlair Rainbow (5 Star)\n\nHold L1 + RS Back, Forward || Hold LB + RS Back, Forward\n\nSkill Move Changes\n\nNew Trickster Playstyle Flicks and Skill Move controls below\n\nTrickster Flicks - R3 + LS in desired direction.\n\nTrickster Ball Roll - L2 + R2 || LT + RT from stand.\n\nTrickster Ball Catch - LT + Fake Shot || LT + Fake Shot from stand.\n\nAttacking Positioning [PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC]\n\nSeveral updates have been made to the Positioning system:\n\nDiagonal Runs\n\nPlayers will now attempt to make more decisive diagonal runs to cut through gaps in the defensive line or hold their position onside\n\nFind Space in the Box\n\nPlayers may position themselves higher inside the box while attempting to find a passing lane to empty space\n\nDynamic Defensive Line\n\nPlayers will adjust to accommodate Wingbacks making attacking runs. They will shift or drop to cover their space while the Wingbacks are out of position.\n\nIf one Wingback has pushed up to an attacking position, the rest of the defensive line will shift to cover and play in the shape of a 3-back\n\nIf both Wingbacks push up to attacking positions and a Defensive Midfielder is on Drop Between Defenders then the two Center Backs will increase their width to allow the DM to drop between them and play as a 3-back"
