Match worn or issued Real Madrid Castilla (Madrid’s B team) away shirt by Antonio Gómez (number 7) in the season 1995-96. In Real Madrid’s first team, Gómez wore the number 27. In the B-team, Real Madrid Castilla, his number was 7. Therefore, it is most likely worn in or issued for a second team game. It’s not from the 1994-95 season of Real Madrid B, because Brazilian football player Sandro wore the number 7.

Antonio Gómez is a former midfielder who was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. He was part of Real Madrid’s youth academy, and he was under the command of Rafael Benítez in Real Madrid Castilla. Gómez made his debut with the first team in the 1995-96 season. In 1996, he played two matches in the Coppa del Rey against Espanyol and six matches in the La Liga. After this season, Gómez was loaned out to Sevilla for one season and then moved to other Spanish club teams. He retired at La Roda in 2006.

The shirt has all the characteristics of a match shirt: correct player size and style name and number with the number being present within the material of the shirt.

In this period, shirts were often used in multiple competition matches by whoever started with that number (so often also by multiple players). It is almost certain that it was worn as reserve competition shirts were only very rarely made.
