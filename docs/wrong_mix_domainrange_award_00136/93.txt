Walther Bothe was a German nuclear physicist whose contributions play an important part in particle physics and various other spheres of science and technology. His research came at a time when nuclear physics was gaining popularity. Many of his works and their derivatives are used even to this day. Many ground-breaking discoveries and observations were able to see the light of day due to his work. His curious mind was so insatiable that even in captivity he made use of the time to study mathematics and read and write Russian. Throughout his life, he held many high-ranking positions and pushed the envelope in theoretical physics. Not only did he learn under many greats, he also taught a few. His efforts did not go in vain and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Despite his illness and frail health, he continued to break new ground in physics. He supervised and gave his inputs to many others until the end of his life. His endless stream of work continued to be a foundation and an extensive source of knowledge in the world of physics.
