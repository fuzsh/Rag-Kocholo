This German nuclear physicist is widely known for his contributions to the method of coincidence, which is used to determine the lifespan of radiation.\n\nIn 1914, Bothe worked with German physicist Hans Geiger — who created the radiation detection device called a Geiger Counter — to develop the coincidence method. This method involves two Geiger counters to precisely detect the release of atomic particles or radiation and associate them with individual atomic reactions or events. By using this method to understand how radiation behaves, scientists can more effectively work with and harness radiation for peaceful uses, such as treating cancer and building and using nuclear reactors. \n\nIt was in 1954 that his collective work in nuclear physics as well as his role in establishing Germany’s first cyclotron earned him half of the Nobel Prize in Physics, with the other half going to German physicist Max Born.\n\nExcerpt from IAEA page\".",
