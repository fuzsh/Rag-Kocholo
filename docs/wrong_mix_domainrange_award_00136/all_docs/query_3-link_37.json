        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe brain is our softest and most vulnerable organ, and understanding its physics is a challenging but significant task. Throughout the past decade, numerous competing models have emerged to characterize its response to mechanical loading. However, selecting the best constitutive model remains a heuristic process that strongly depends on user experience and personal preference. Here we challenge the conventional wisdom to first select a constitutive model and then fit its parameters to data. Instead, we propose a new strategy that simultaneously discovers both model and parameters. We integrate more than a century of knowledge in thermodynamics and state-of-the-art machine learning to build a Constitutive Artificial Neural Network that enables automated model discovery. Our design paradigm is to reverse engineer the network from a set of functional building blocks that are, by design, a generalization of popular constitutive models, including the neo Hookean, Blatz Ko, Mooney Rivlin, Demiray, Gent, and Holzapfel models. By constraining input, output, activation functions, and architecture, our network a priori satisfies thermodynamic consistency, objectivity, symmetry, and polyconvexity. We demonstrate that-out of more than 4000 models-our network autonomously discovers the model and parameters that best characterize the behavior of human gray and white matter under tension, compression, and shear. Importantly, our network weights translate naturally into physically meaningful parameters, such as shear moduli of 1.82kPa, 0.88kPa, 0.94kPa, and 0.54kPa for the cortex, basal ganglia, corona radiata, and corpus callosum. Our results suggest that Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks have the potential to induce a paradigm shift in soft tissue modeling, from user-defined model selection to automated model discovery. Our source code, data, and examples are available at https://github.com/LivingMatterLab/CANN. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Human brain is ultrasoft, difficult to test, and challenging to model. Numerous competing constitutive models exist, but selecting the best model remains a matter of personal preference. Here we automate the process of model selection. We formulate the problem of autonomous model discovery as a neural network and capitalize on the powerful optimizers in deep learning. However, rather than using a conventional neural network, we reverse engineer our own Constitutive Artificial Neural Network from a set of modular building blocks, which we rationalize from common constitutive models. When trained with tension, compression, and shear experiments of gray and white matter, our network simultaneously discovers both model and parameters that describes the data better than any existing invariant-based model. Our network could induce a paradigm shift from user-defined model selection to automated model discovery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.actbio.2023.01.055\n\nView details for PubMedID 36736643\n\nAbstract\n\nAmyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau protein are known drivers of neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease. Tau in particular spreads in the brains of patients following a spatiotemporal pattern that is highly sterotypical and correlated with subsequent neurodegeneration. Novel medical imaging techniques can now visualize the distribution of tau in the brain in vivo, allowing for new insights to the dynamics of this biomarker. Here we personalize a network diffusion model with global spreading and local production terms to longitudinal tau positron emission tomography data of 76 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We use Bayesian inference with a hierarchical prior structure to infer means and credible intervals for our model parameters on group and subject levels. Our results show that the group average protein production rate for amyloid positive subjects is significantly higher with 0.019±0.27/yr, than that for amyloid negative subjects with -0.143±0.21/yr (p = 0.0075). These results support the hypothesis that amyloid pathology drives tau pathology. The calibrated model could serve as a valuable clinical tool to identify optimal time points for follow-up scans and predict the timeline of disease progression.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fphys.2021.702975\n\nView details for PubMedID 34335308\n\nAbstract\n\nThroughout the past six months, no number has dominated the public media more persistently than the reproduction number of COVID-19. This powerful but simple concept is widely used by the public media, scientists, and political decision makers to explain and justify political strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Europe. We propose a dynamic SEIR epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction number, which we identify using machine learning. During the early outbreak, the basic reproduction number was 4.22 ± 1.69, with maximum values of 6.33 and 5.88 in Germany and the Netherlands. By May 10, 2020, it dropped to 0.67 ± 0.18, with minimum values of 0.37 and 0.28 in Hungary and Slovakia. We found a strong correlation between passenger air travel, driving, walking, and transit mobility and the effective reproduction number with a time delay of 17.24 ± 2.00 days. Our new dynamic SEIR model provides the flexibility to simulate various outbreak control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify safe solutions in the benefit of global health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00466-020-01880-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 32836597\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7385940\n\nAbstract\n\nAlzheimer's disease is associated with the cerebral accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The progressive occurrence of tau aggregates in different brain regions is closely related to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. However, our current understanding of tau propagation relies almost exclusively on postmortem histopathology, and the precise propagation dynamics of misfolded tau in the living brain remain poorly understood. Here we combine longitudinal positron emission tomography and dynamic network modeling to test the hypothesis that misfolded tau propagates preferably along neuronal connections. We follow 46 subjects for three or four annual positron emission tomography scans and compare their pathological tau profiles against brain network models of intracellular and extracellular spreading. For each subject, we identify a personalized set of model parameters that characterizes the individual progression of pathological tau. Across all subjects, the mean protein production rate was 0.21 ± 0.15 and the intracellular diffusion coefficient was 0.34 ± 0.43. Our network diffusion model can serve as a tool to detect non-clinical symptoms at an earlier stage and make informed predictions about the timeline of neurodegeneration on an individual personalized basis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fnins.2020.566876\n\nView details for PubMedID 33424532\n\nAbstract\n\nFueled by breakthrough technology developments, the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences are now collecting more data than ever before. There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform decision making for the benefit of human health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41746-019-0193-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 31799423\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6877584\n\nAbstract\n\nData-driven methods have changed the way we understand and model materials. However, while providing unmatched flexibility, these methods have limitations such as reduced capacity to extrapolate, overfitting, and violation of physics constraints. Recently, frameworks that automatically satisfy these requirements have been proposed. Here we review, extend, and compare three promising data-driven methods: Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (CANN), Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNN), and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). Our formulation expands the strain energy potentials in terms of sums of convex non-decreasing functions of invariants and linear combinations of these. The expansion of the energy is shared across all three methods and guarantees the automatic satisfaction of objectivity, material symmetries, and polyconvexity, essential within the context of hyperelasticity. To benchmark the methods, we train them against rubber and skin stress-strain data. All three approaches capture the data almost perfectly, without overfitting, and have some capacity to extrapolate. This is in contrast to unconstrained neural networks which fail to make physically meaningful predictions outside the training range. Interestingly, the methods find different energy functions even though the prediction on the stress data is nearly identical. The most notable differences are observed in the second derivatives, which could impact performance of numerical solvers. On the rich data used in these benchmarks, the models show the anticipated trade-off between number of parameters and accuracy. Overall, CANN, ICNN and NODE retain the flexibility and accuracy of other data-driven methods without compromising on the physics. These methods are ideal options to model arbitrary hyperelastic material behavior.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00466-023-02355-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 38741577\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11090478\n\nAbstract\n\nThe stiffness of soft biological tissues not only depends on the applied deformation, but also on the deformation rate. To model this type of behavior, traditional approaches select a specific time-dependent constitutive model and fit its parameters to experimental data. Instead, a new trend now suggests a machine-learning based approach that simultaneously discovers both the best model and best parameters to explain given data. Recent studies have shown that feed-forward constitutive neural networks can robustly discover constitutive models and parameters for hyperelastic materials. However, feed-forward architectures fail to capture the history dependence of viscoelastic soft tissues. Here we combine a feed-forward constitutive neural network for the hyperelastic response and a recurrent neural network for the viscous response inspired by the theory of quasi-linear viscoelasticity. Our novel rheologically-informed network architecture discovers the time-independent initial stress using the feed-forward network and the time-dependent relaxation using the recurrent network. We train and test our combined network using unconfined compression relaxation experiments of passive skeletal muscle and compare our discovered model to a neo Hookean standard linear solid, to an advanced mechanics-based model, and to a vanilla recurrent neural network with no mechanics knowledge. We demonstrate that, for limited experimental data, our new constitutive recurrent neural network discovers models and parameters that satisfy basic physical principles and generalize well to unseen data. We discover a Mooney-Rivlin type two-term initial stored energy function that is linear in the first invariant I1 and quadratic in the second invariant I2 with stiffness parameters of 0.60 kPa and 0.55 kPa. We also discover a Prony-series type relaxation function with time constants of 0.362s, 2.54s, and 52.0s with coefficients of 0.89, 0.05, and 0.03. Our newly discovered model outperforms both the neo Hookean standard linear solid and the vanilla recurrent neural network in terms of prediction accuracy on unseen data. Our results suggest that constitutive recurrent neural networks can autonomously discover both model and parameters that best explain experimental data of soft viscoelastic tissues.

By leveraging cardiac MRI data and ventricular pressure measurements, we can estimate in vivo passive myocardial stiffness using personalized inverse finite element models. While it is well-known that this approach is subject to uncertainties, only few studies quantify the accuracy of these stiffness estimates. This lack of validation is, at least in part, due to the absence of ground truth in vivo passive myocardial stiffness values. Here, using 3D printing, we created soft, homogenous, isotropic, hyperelastic heart phantoms of varying geometry and stiffness and simulate diastolic filling by incorporating the phantoms into an MRI-compatible left ventricular inflation system. We estimate phantom stiffness from MRI and pressure data using inverse finite element analyses based on a Neo-Hookean model. We demonstrate that our identified softest and stiffest values of 215.7 and 512.3kPa agree well with the ground truth of 226.2 and 526.4kPa. Overall, our estimated stiffnesses revealed a good agreement with the ground truth ([Formula: see text] error) across all models. Our results suggest that MRI-driven computational constitutive modeling can accurately estimate synthetic heart material stiffnesses in the range of 200-500kPa.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10439-023-03164-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 36914919\n\nAbstract\n\nHead injury simulations predict the occurrence of traumatic brain injury by placing a threshold on the calculated strains for axon tracts within the brain. However, a current roadblock to accurate injury prediction is the selection of an appropriate axon damage threshold. While several computational studies have used models of the axon cytoskeleton to investigate damage initiation, these models all employ an idealized, homogeneous axonal geometry. This homogeneous geometry with regularly spaced microtubules, evenly distributed throughout the model, overestimates axon strength because in reality, the axon cytoskeleton is heterogeneous. In the heterogeneous cytoskeleton, the weakest cross section determines the initiation of failure, but these weak spots are not present in a homogeneous model. Addressing one source of heterogeneity in the axon cytoskeleton, we present a new semi-automated image analysis pipeline for using serial section transmission electron micrographs (ssTEM) to reconstruct the microtubule geometry of an axon. The image analysis procedure locates microtubules within the images, traces them throughout the image stack, and reconstructs the microtubule structure as a finite element mesh. We demonstrate the image analysis approach using a C. elegans touch receptor neuron due to the availability of high-quality ssTEM datasets. The results of the analysis highlight the heterogeneity of the microtubule structure in the spatial variation of both microtubule number and length. Simulations comparing this image-based geometry to homogeneous geometries show that structural heterogeneity in the image-based model creates significant spatial variation in deformation. The homogeneous geometries, on the other hand, deform more uniformly. Since no single homogeneous model can replicate the mechanical behavior of the image-based model, our results argue that heterogeneity in axon microtubule geometry should be considered in determining accurate axon failure thresholds.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.bpj.2022.11.2946\n\nView details for PubMedID 36461640\n\nAbstract\n\nUnderstanding tissue rheology is critical to accurately model the human heart. While the elastic properties of cardiac tissue have been extensively studied, its viscous properties remain an issue of ongoing debate. Here we adopt a viscoelastic version of the classical Holzapfel Ogden model to study the viscous timescales of human cardiac tissue. We perform a series of simulations and explore stress-relaxation curves, pressure-volume loops, strain profiles, and ventricular wall strains for varying viscosity parameters. We show that the time window for model calibration strongly influences the parameter identification. Using a four-chamber human heart model, we observe that, during the physiologically relevant time scales of the cardiac cycle, viscous relaxation has a negligible effect on the overall behavior of the heart. While viscosity could have important consequences in pathological conditions with compromised contraction or relaxation properties, we conclude that, for simulations within the physiological range of a human heart beat, we can reasonably approximate the human heart as hyperelastic.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00466-022-02180-z\n\nView details for PubMedID 37274842\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10237084\n\nAbstract\n\nThe computational simulation of pathological conditions and surgical procedures, for example the removal of cancerous tissue, can contribute crucially to the future of medicine. Especially for brain surgery, these methods can be important, as the ultra-soft tissue controls vital functions of the body. However, the microstructural interactions and their effects on macroscopic material properties remain incompletely understood. Therefore, we investigated the mechanical behaviour of brain tissue under three different deformation modes, axial tension, compression, and semi-confined compression, in different anatomical regions, and for varying axon orientation. In addition, we characterised the underlying microstructure in terms of myelin, cells, glial cells and neuron area fraction, and density. The correlation of these quantities with the material parameters of the anisotropic Ogden model reveals a decrease in shear modulus with increasing myelin area fraction. Strikingly, the tensile shear modulus correlates positively with cell and neuronal area fraction (Spearman's correlation coefficient of rs=0.40 and rs=0.33), whereas the compressive shear modulus decreases with increasing glial cell area (rs=-0.33). Our study finds that tissue non-linearity significantly depends on the myelin area fraction (rs=0.47), cell density (rs=0.41) and glial cell area (rs=0.49). Our results provide an important step towards understanding the micromechanical load transfer that leads to the non-linear macromechanical behaviour of the brain. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Within this article, we investigate the mechanical behaviour of brain tissue under three different deformation modes, in different anatomical regions, and for varying axon orientation. Further, we characterise the underlying microstructure in terms of various constituents. The correlation of these quantities with the material parameters of the anisotropic Ogden model reveals a decrease in shear modulus with increasing myelin area fraction. Strikingly, the tensile shear modulus correlates positively with cell and neuronal area fraction, whereas the compressive shear modulus decreases with increasing glial cell area.

Computational models aid scientists in studying the role of mechanical forces in axon growth and damage. These studies use simulations to evaluate how different sources of force generation within the cytoskeleton interact with each other to regulate axon elongation and retraction. Furthermore, mathematical models can help optimize externally applied tension to promote axon growth without causing damage. Finally, scientists also use simulations of axon damage to investigate how forces are distributed among different components of the axon and how the tissue surrounding an axon influences its susceptibility to injury. In this review, we discuss how computational studies complement experimental studies in the areas of axon growth, regeneration, and damage.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.semcdb.2022.04.019\n\nView details for PubMedID 35474150\n\nAbstract\n\nCardiovascular disease in women remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Recent studies suggest that this is caused, at least in part, by the lack of sex-specific diagnostic criteria. While it is widely recognized that the female heart is smaller than the male heart, it has long been ignored that it also has a different microstructural architecture. This has severe implications on a multitude of cardiac parameters. Here, we systematically review and compare geometric, functional, and structural parameters of female and male hearts, both in the healthy population and in athletes. Our study finds that, compared to the male heart, the female heart has a larger ejection fraction and beats at a faster rate but generates a smaller cardiac output. It has a lower blood pressure but produces universally larger contractile strains. Critically, allometric scaling, e.g., by lean body mass, reduces but does not completely eliminate the sex differences between female and male hearts. Our results suggest that the sex differences in cardiac form and function are too complex to be ignored: the female heart is not just a small version of the male heart. When using similar diagnostic criteria for female and male hearts, cardiac disease in women is frequently overlooked by routine exams, and it is diagnosed later and with more severe symptoms than in men. Clearly, there is an urgent need to better understand the female heart and design sex-specific diagnostic criteria that will allow us to diagnose cardiac disease in women equally as early, robustly, and reliably as in men.Systematic Review Registration: https://livingmatter.stanford.edu/.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fphys.2022.831179\n\nView details for PubMedID 35392369\n\nAbstract\n\nComputational investigations of how soft tissues grow and remodel are gaining more and more interest and several growth and remodeling theories have been developed. Roughly, two main groups of theories for soft tissues can be distinguished: kinematic-based growth theory and theories based on constrained mixture theory. Our goal was to apply these two theories on the same experimental data. Within the experiment, a pulmonary artery was exposed to systemic conditions. The change in diameter was followed-up over time. A mechanical and microstructural analysis of native pulmonary artery and pulmonary autograft was conducted. Whereas the kinematic-based growth theory is able to accurately capture the growth of the tissue, it does not account for the mechanobiological processes causing this growth. The constrained mixture theory takes into account the mechanobiological processes including removal, deposition and adaptation of all structural constituents, allowing us to simulate a changing microstructure and mechanical behavior.

By the end of March 2020, almost all colleges and universities in the United States had transitioned to an all online education and many institutions have not yet fully reopened to date. For a residential campus like Stanford University, the major challenge of reopening is to estimate the number of incoming infectious students at the first day of class. Here we learn the number of incoming infectious students using Bayesian inference and perform a series of retrospective and projective simulations to quantify the risk of campus reopening. We create a physics-based probabilistic model to infer the local reproduction dynamics for each state and adopt a network SEIR model to simulate the return of all undergraduates, broken down by their year of enrollment and state of origin. From these returning student populations, we predict the outbreak dynamics throughout the spring, summer, fall, and winter quarters using the inferred reproduction dynamics of Santa Clara County. We compare three different scenarios: the true outbreak dynamics under the wild-type SARS-CoV-2, and the hypothetical outbreak dynamics under the new COVID-19 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 with 56% and 50% increased transmissibility. Our study reveals that even small changes in transmissibility can have an enormous impact on the overall case numbers. With no additional countermeasures, during the most affected quarter, the fall of 2020, there would have been 203 cases under baseline reproduction, compared to 4727 and 4256 cases for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Our results suggest that population mixing presents an increased risk for local outbreaks, especially with new and more infectious variants emerging across the globe. Tight outbreak control through mandatory quarantine and test-trace-isolate strategies will be critical in successfully managing these local outbreak dynamics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11831-021-09638-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 34456557\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8381867\n\nAbstract\n\nMachine learning is increasingly recognized as a promising technology in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences. There can be no argument that this technique is incredibly successful in image recognition with immediate applications in diagnostics including electrophysiology, radiology, or pathology, where we have access to massive amounts of annotated data. However, machine learning often performs poorly in prognosis, especially when dealing with sparse data. This is a field where classical physics-based simulation seems to remain irreplaceable. In this review, we identify areas in the biomedical sciences where machine learning and multiscale modeling can mutually benefit from one another: Machine learning can integrate physics-based knowledge in the form of governing equations, boundary conditions, or constraints to manage ill-posted problems and robustly handle sparse and noisy data; multiscale modeling can integrate machine learning to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics and parameters, analyze sensitivities, and quantify uncertainty to bridge the scales and understand the emergence of function. With a view towards applications in the life sciences, we discuss the state of the art of combining machine learning and multiscale modeling, identify applications and opportunities, raise open questions, and address potential challenges and limitations. We anticipate that it will stimulate discussion within the community of computational mechanics and reach out to other disciplines including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, systems biology, and precision medicine to join forces towards creating robust and efficient models for biological systems.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11831-020-09405-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 34093005\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8172124\n\nAbstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to present enormous challenges for colleges and universities and strategies for save reopening remain a topic of ongoing debate. Many institutions that reopened cautiously in the fall experienced a massive wave of infections and colleges were soon declared as the new hotspots of the pandemic. However, the precise effects of college outbreaks on their immediate neighborhood remain largely unknown. Here we show that the first two weeks of instruction present a high-risk period for campus outbreaks and that these outbreaks tend to spread into the neighboring communities. By integrating a classical mathematical epidemiology model and Bayesian learning, we learned the dynamic reproduction number for 30 colleges from their daily case reports. Of these 30 institutions, 14 displayed a spike of infections within the first two weeks of class, with peak seven-day incidences well above 1,000 per 100,000, an order of magnitude larger than the nation-wide peaks of 70 and 150 during the first and second waves of the pandemic. While most colleges were able to rapidly reduce the number of new infections, many failed to control the spread of the virus beyond their own campus: Within only two weeks, 17 campus outbreaks translated directly into peaks of infection within their home counties. These findings suggests that college campuses are at risk to develop an extreme incidence of COVID-19 and become superspreaders for neighboring communities. We anticipate that tight test-trace-quarantine strategies, flexible transition to online instruction, and-most importantly-compliance with local regulations will be critical to ensure a safe campus reopening after the winter break.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1080/10255842.2020.1869221\n\nView details for PubMedID 33439055\n\nAbstract\n\nThe spreading of infectious diseases including COVID-19 depends on human interactions. In an environment where behavioral patterns and physical contacts are constantly evolving according to new governmental regulations, measuring these interactions is a major challenge. Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly, for human interactions. Here, we study the coupling between mobility and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease phases. For ten European countries, our study shows a maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag of [Formula: see text] days. Our findings suggest that trends in local mobility allow us to forecast the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 for a window of two weeks and adjust local control strategies in real time.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10237-020-01408-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 33449276\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7809648\n\nAbstract\n\nThe electrical activity in the heart varies significantly between men and women and results in a sex-specific response to drugs. Recent evidence suggests that women are more than twice as likely as men to develop drug-induced arrhythmia with potentially fatal consequences. Yet, the sex-specific differences in drug-induced arrhythmogenesis remain poorly understood. Here we integrate multiscale modeling and machine learning to gain mechanistic insight into the sex-specific origin of drug-induced cardiac arrhythmia at differing drug concentrations. To quantify critical drug concentrations in male and female hearts, we identify the most important ion channels that trigger male and female arrhythmogenesis, and create and train a sex-specific multi-fidelity arrhythmogenic risk classifier. Our study reveals that sex differences in ion channel activity, tissue conductivity, and heart dimensions trigger longer QT-intervals in women than in men. We quantify the critical drug concentration for dofetilide, a high risk drug, to be seven times lower for women than for men. Our results emphasize the importance of including sex as an independent biological variable in risk assessment during drug development. Acknowledging and understanding sex differences in drug safety evaluation is critical when developing novel therapeutic treatments on a personalized basis.

Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019-February 13, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cma.2020.113410\n\nView details for PubMedID 33518823\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7831913\n\nAbstract\n\nThe cortical thickness is a characteristic biomarker for a wide variety of neurological disorders. While the structural organization of the cerebral cortex is tightly regulated and evolutionarily preserved, its thickness varies widely between 1.5 and 4.5 mm across the healthy adult human brain. It remains unclear whether these thickness variations are a cause or consequence of cortical development. Recent studies suggest that cortical thickness variations are primarily a result of genetic effects. Previous studies showed that a simple homogeneous bilayered system with a growing layer on an elastic substrate undergoes a unique symmetry breaking into a spatially heterogeneous system with discrete gyri and sulci. Here, we expand on that work to explore the evolution of cortical thickness variations over time to support our finding that cortical pattern formation and thickness variations can be explained - at least in part - by the physical forces that emerge during cortical folding. Strikingly, as growth progresses, the developing gyri universally thicken and the sulci thin, even in the complete absence of regional information. Using magnetic resonance images, we demonstrate that these naturally emerging thickness variations agree with the cortical folding pattern in n = 9 healthy adult human brains, in n = 564 healthy human brains ages 7-64, and in n = 73 infant brains scanned at birth, and at ages one and two. Additionally, we show that cortical organoids develop similar patterns throughout their growth. Our results suggest that genetic, geometric, and physical events during brain development are closely interrelated. Understanding regional and temporal variations in cortical thickness can provide insight into the evolution and causative factors of neurological disorders, inform the diagnosis of neurological conditions, and assess the efficacy of treatment options.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1140/epjst/e2020-000001-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 37275766\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10237175\n\nAbstract\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's are associated with the prion-like propagation and aggregation of toxic proteins. A long standing hypothesis that amyloid-beta drives Alzheimer's disease has proven the subject of contemporary controversy; leading to new research in both the role of tau protein and its interaction with amyloid-beta. Conversely, recent work in mathematical modeling has demonstrated the relevance of nonlinear reaction-diffusion type equations to capture essential features of the disease. Such approaches have been further simplified, to network-based models, and offer researchers a powerful set of computationally tractable tools with which to investigate neurodegenerative disease dynamics. Here, we propose a novel, coupled network-based model for a two-protein system that includes an enzymatic interaction term alongside a simple model of aggregate transneuronal damage. We apply this theoretical model to test the possible interactions between tau proteins and amyloid-beta and study the resulting coupled behavior between toxic protein clearance and proteopathic phenomenology. Our analysis reveals ways in which amyloid-beta and tau proteins may conspire with each other to enhance the nucleation and propagation of different diseases, thus shedding new light on the importance of protein clearance and protein interaction mechanisms in prion-like models of neurodegenerative disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008267\n\nView details for PubMedID 33048932\n\nAbstract\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that the mechanical behavior of the brain plays a critical role in development, disease, and aging. Recent studies have begun to characterize the mechanical behavior of gray and white matter tissue and to identify sets of material models that best reproduce the stress-strain behavior of different brain regions. Yet, these models are mainly phenomenological in nature, their parameters often lack clear physical interpretation, and they fail to correlate the mechanical behavior to the underlying microstructural composition. Here we make a first attempt towards identifying general relations between microstructure and mechanics with the ultimate goal to develop microstructurally motivated constitutive equations for human brain tissue. Using histological staining, we analyze the microstructure of brain specimens from different anatomical regions, the cortex, basal ganglia, corona radiata, and corpus callosum, and identify the regional stiffness and viscosity under multiple loading conditions, simple shear, compression, and tension. Strikingly, our study reveals a negative correlation between cell count and stiffness, a positive correlation between myelin content and stiffness, and a negative correlation between proteoglycan content and stiffness. Additionally, our analysis shows a positive correlation between lipid and proteoglycan content and viscosity. We demonstrate how understanding the microstructural origin of the macroscopic behavior of the brain can help us design microstructure-informed material models for human brain tissue that inherently capture regional heterogeneities. This study represents an important step towards using brain tissue stiffness and viscosity as early diagnostic markers for clinical conditions including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The complex and heterogeneous mechanical properties of brain tissue play a critical role for brain function. To understand and predict how brain tissue properties vary in space and time, it will be key to link the mechanical behavior to the underlying microstructural composition. Here we use histological staining to quantify area fractions of microstructural components of mechanically tested specimens and evaluate their individual contributions to the nonlinear macroscopic mechanical response. We further propose a microstructure-informed material model for human brain tissue that inherently captures regional heterogeneities. The current work provides unprecedented insights into the biomechanics of human brain tissue, which are highly relevant to develop refined computational models for brain tissue behavior or to advance neural tissue engineering.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.actbio.2019.12.030\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000517348400005\n\nView details for PubMedID 31887455\n\nAbstract\n\nAll medications have adverse effects. Among the most serious of these are cardiac arrhythmias. Current paradigms for drug safety evaluation are costly, lengthy, conservative, and impede efficient drug development. Here, we combine multiscale experiment and simulation, high-performance computing, and machine learning to create a risk estimator to stratify new and existing drugs according to their proarrhythmic potential. We capitalize on recent developments in machine learning and integrate information across 10 orders of magnitude in space and time to provide a holistic picture of the effects of drugs, either individually or in combination with other drugs. We show, both experimentally and computationally, that drug-induced arrhythmias are dominated by the interplay between two currents with opposing effects: the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current and the L-type calcium current. Using Gaussian process classification, we create a classifier that stratifies drugs into safe and arrhythmic domains for any combinations of these two currents. We demonstrate that our classifier correctly identifies the risk categories of 22 common drugs exclusively on the basis of their concentrations at 50% current block. Our new risk assessment tool explains under which conditions blocking the L-type calcium current can delay or even entirely suppress arrhythmogenic events. Using machine learning in drug safety evaluation can provide a more accurate and comprehensive mechanistic assessment of the proarrhythmic potential of new drugs. Our study paves the way toward establishing science-based criteria to accelerate drug development, design safer drugs, and reduce heart rhythm disorders.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.bpj.2020.01.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 32023435\n\nAbstract\n\nUnderstanding the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 through the lens of mathematical models is an elusive but significant goal. Within only half a year, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 19 million reported cases across 188 countries with more than 700,000 deaths worldwide. Unlike any other disease in history, COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented volume of data, well documented, continuously updated, and broadly available to the general public. Yet, the precise role of mathematical modeling in providing quantitative insight into the COVID-19 pandemic remains a topic of ongoing debate. Here we discuss the lessons learned from six month of modeling COVID-19. We highlight the early success of classical models for infectious diseases and show why these models fail to predict the current outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. We illustrate how data-driven modeling can integrate classical epidemiology modeling and machine learning to infer critical disease parameters-in real time-from reported case data to make informed predictions and guide political decision making. We critically discuss questions that these models can and cannot answer and showcase controversial decisions around the early outbreak dynamics, outbreak control, and exit strategies. We anticipate that this summary will stimulate discussion within the modeling community and help provide guidelines for robust mathematical models to understand and manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in [Formula: see text] provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 ± 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 ± 0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82 ± 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in [Formula: see text] states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China and found a contact period of 3.38 ± 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that-without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today-the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 ± 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10237-020-01332-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 32342242\n\nAbstract\n\nOne of the most remarkable differences between classical engineering materials and living matter is the ability of the latter to grow and remodel in response to diverse stimuli. The mechanical behaviour of living matter is governed not only by an elastic or viscoelastic response to loading on short time scales up to several minutes, but also by often crucial growth and remodelling responses on time scales from hours to months. Phenomena of growth and remodelling play important roles, for example during morphogenesis in early life as well as in homeostasis and pathogenesis in adult tissues, which often adapt to changes in their chemo-mechanical environment as a result of ageing, diseases, injury or surgical intervention. Mechano-regulated growth and remodelling are observed in various soft tissues, ranging from tendons and arteries to the eye and brain, but also in bone, lower organisms and plants. Understanding and predicting growth and remodelling of living systems is one of the most important challenges in biomechanics and mechanobiology. This article reviews the current state of growth and remodelling as it applies primarily to soft tissues, and provides a perspective on critical challenges and future directions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1098/rsif.2019.0233\n\nView details for PubMedID 31431183\n\nAbstract\n\nWrinkling is a universal instability occurring in a wide variety of engineering and biological materials. It has been studied extensively for many different systems but a full description is still lacking. Here, we provide a systematic analysis of the wrinkling of a thin hyperelastic film over a substrate in plane strain using stream functions. For comparison, we assume that wrinkling is generated either by the isotropic growth of the film or by the lateral compression of the entire system. We perform an exhaustive linear analysis of the wrinkling problem for all stiffness ratios and under a variety of additional boundary and material effects. Namely, we consider the effect of added pressure, surface tension, an upper substrate and fibres. We obtain analytical estimates of the instability in the two asymptotic regimes of long and short wavelengths.

Various drugs are known to trigger QT interval prolongation and increase the proarrhythmic potential. Yet, how precisely the action of drugs on the cellular level translates into QT interval prolongation on the whole organ level remains insufficiently understood. Here we use machine learning techniques to systematically characterize the effect of 30 common drugs on the QT interval. We combine information from high fidelity three-dimensional human heart simulations with low fidelity one-dimensional cable simulations to build a surrogate model for the QT interval using multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression. Once trained and cross-validated, we apply our surrogate model to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that compounds that block the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current IKr have the greatest prolonging effect of the QT interval, and that blocking the L-type calcium current ICaL and late sodium current INaL shortens the QT interval. Our uncertainty quantification allows us to propagate the experimental variability from individual block-concentration measurements into the QT interval and reveals that QT interval uncertainty is mainly driven by the variability in IKr block. In a final validation study, we demonstrate an excellent agreement between our predicted QT interval changes and the changes observed in a randomized clinical trial for the drugs dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and verapamil. We anticipate that both the machine learning methods and the results of this study will have great potential in the efficient development of safer drugs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cma.2019.01.033\n\nView details for PubMedID 32863454\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7454226\n\nAbstract\n\nThe cerebellum is a tightly folded structure located at the back of the head. Unlike the folds of the cerebrum, the folds of the cerebellum are aligned such that the external surface appears to be covered in parallel grooves. Experiments have shown that anchoring center initiation drives cerebellar foliation. However, the mechanism guiding the location of these anchoring centers, and subsequently cerebellar morphology, remains poorly understood. In particular, there is no definitive mechanistic explanation for the preferential emergence of parallel folds instead of an irregular folding pattern like in the cerebral cortex. Here we use mechanical modeling on the cellular and tissue scales to show that the oriented granule cell division observed in the experimental setting leads to the characteristic parallel folding pattern of the cerebellum. Specifically, we propose an agent-based model of cell clones, a strategy for propagating information from our in silico cell clones to the tissue scale, and an analytical solution backed by numerical results to understand how differential growth between the cerebellar layers drives geometric instability in three dimensional space on the tissue scale. This proposed mechanical model provides further insight into the process of anchoring center initiation and establishes a framework for future multiscale mechanical analysis of developing organs.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30758032\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To quantify the effects of annuloplasty rings designed to treat ischemic/functional mitral regurgitation on left ventricular septal-lateral (S-L) and commissure-commissure (C-C) dimensions.METHODS: Radiopaque markers were placed as opposing pairs on the S-L and C-C aspects of the mitral annulus and the basal, equatorial, and apical level of the left ventricle (LV) in 30 sheep. Ten true-sized Carpentier-Edwards Physio (PHY), Edwards IMR ETlogix (ETL), and GeoForm (GEO; all from Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif) annuloplasty rings were inserted in a releasable fashion. After 90seconds of left circumflex artery occlusion with the ring implanted (RING), 4-dimensional marker coordinates were obtained using biplane videofluoroscopy. After ring release, another data set was acquired after another 90seconds of left circumflex artery occlusion (NO RING). S-L and C-C diameters were computed as the distances between the respective marker pairs at end-diastole. Percent change in diameters was calculated between RING versus NO RING as 100*(diameter in centimeters [RING]-diameter in centimeters [NO RING])/diameter in centimeters [NO RING]).RESULTS: Compared with NO RING, all ring types (PHY, ETL, and GEO) reduced mitral annular S-L dimensions by -20.7±5.6%, -26.8±3.9%, and -34.5±3.8%, respectively. GEO reduced the S-L dimensions of the LV at the basal level only by -2.3±2.4%, whereas all other S-L dimensions of the LV remained unchanged with all 3 rings implanted. PHY, ETL, and GEO reduced mitral annular C-C dimensions by -17.5±4.8%, -19.6±2.5, and -8.3±4.9%, respectively, but none of the rings altered the C-C dimensions of the LV.CONCLUSIONS: Despite radical reduction of mitral annular size, disease-specific ischemic/functional mitral regurgitation annuloplasty rings do not induce relevantchanges of left ventricular dimensions in the acutely ischemic ovine heart.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30803776\n\nAbstract\n\nThe prion hypothesis states that misfolded proteins can act as infectious agents that template the misfolding and aggregation of healthy proteins to transmit a disease. Increasing evidence suggests that pathological proteins in neurodegenerative diseases adopt prion-like mechanisms and spread across the brain along anatomically connected networks. Local kinetic models of protein misfolding and global network models of protein spreading provide valuable insight into several aspects of prion-like diseases. Yet, to date, these models have not been combined to simulate how pathological proteins multiply and spread across the human brain. Here, we create an efficient and robust tool to simulate the spreading of misfolded protein using three classes of kinetic models, the Fisher-Kolmogorov model, the Heterodimer model and the Smoluchowski model. We discretize their governing equations using a human brain network model, which we represent as a weighted Laplacian graph generated from 418 brains from the Human Connectome Project. Its nodes represent the anatomic regions of interest and its edges are weighted by the mean fibre number divided by the mean fibre length between any two regions. We demonstrate that our brain network model can predict the histopathological patterns of Alzheimer's disease and capture the key characteristic features of finite-element brain models at a fraction of their computational cost: simulating the spatio-temporal evolution of aggregate size distributions across the human brain throughout a period of 40 years takes less than 7 s on a standard laptop computer. Our model has the potential to predict biomarker curves, aggregate size distributions, infection times, and the effects of therapeutic strategies including reduced production and increased clearance of misfolded protein.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1098/rsif.2019.0356\n\nView details for PubMedID 31615329\n\nAbstract\n\nThe prion-like hypothesis of neurodegenerative diseases states that the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the form of aggregates is responsible for tissue death and its associated neurodegenerative pathology and cognitive decline. Some disease-specific misfolded proteins can interact with healthy proteins to form long chains that are transported through the brain along axonal pathways. Since aggregates of different sizes have different transport properties and toxicity, it is important to follow independently their evolution in space and time. Here, we model the spreading and propagation of aggregates of misfolded proteins in the brain using the general Smoluchowski theory of nucleation, aggregation, and fragmentation. The transport processes considered here are either anisotropic diffusion along axonal bundles or discrete Laplacian transport along a network. In particular, we model the spreading and aggregation of both amyloid-β and τ molecules in the brain connectome. We show that these two models lead to different size distributions and different propagation along the network. A detailed analysis of these two models reveals the existence of four different stages with different dynamics and invasive properties.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.110102\n\nView details for PubMedID 31809717\n\nAbstract\n\nWrinkling instabilities appear in soft materials when a flat elastic layer on an elastic substrate is sufficiently stressed that it buckles with a wavy pattern to minimize the energy of the system. This instability is known to play an important role in engineering, but it also appears in many biological systems. In these systems, the stresses responsible for the wrinkling instability are often created through differential growth of the two layers. Beyond the instability, the upper and lower sides of the elastic layer are subject to different forces. This difference in forces leads to an interesting symmetry breaking whereby the thickness becomes larger at ridges than at valleys. Here we carry out an extensive analysis of this phenomenon by combining analytical, computational, and simple polymer experiments to show that symmetry breaking is a generic property of such systems. We apply our idea to the cortical folding of the brain for which it has been known for over a century that there is a thickness difference between gyri and sulci. An extensive analysis of hundreds of human brains reveals a systematic region-dependent thickness variation. Our results suggest that the evolving thickness patterns during brain development, similar to our polymer experiments, follow simple physics-based laws: Gyri are universally thicker than sulci.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.228002\n\nView details for PubMedID 30547630\n\nAbstract\n\nTorsades de pointes is a serious side effect of many drugs that can trigger sudden cardiac death, even in patients with structurally normal hearts. Torsadogenic risk has traditionally been correlated with the blockage of a specific potassium channel and a prolonged recovery period in the electrocardiogram. However, the precise mechanisms by which single channel block translates into heart rhythm disorders remain incompletely understood. Here we establish a multiscale exposure-response simulator that converts block-concentration characteristics from single cell recordings into three-dimensional excitation profiles and electrocardiograms to rapidly assess torsadogenic risk. For the drug dofetilide, we characterize the QT interval and heart rate at different drug concentrations and identify the critical concentration at the onset of torsades de pointes: For dofetilide concentrations of 2x, 3x, and 4x, as multiples of the free plasma concentration Cmax=2.1nM, the QT interval increased by+62.0%,+71.2%, and+82.3% compared to baseline, and the heart rate changed by-21.7%,-23.3%, and+88.3%. The last number indicates that, at the critical concentration of 4x, the heart spontaneously developed an episode of a torsades-like arrhythmia. Strikingly, this critical drug concentration is higher than the concentration estimated from early afterdepolarizations in single cells and lower than in one-dimensional cable models. Our results highlight the importance of whole heart modeling and explain, at least in part, why current regulatory paradigms often fail to accurately quantify the pro-arrhythmic potential of a drug. Our exposure-response simulator could provide a more mechanistic assessment of pro-arrhythmic risk and help establish science-based guidelines to reduce rhythm disorders, design safer drugs, and accelerate drug development.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30482568\n\nAbstract\n\nCerebral atrophy in response to traumatic brain injury is a well-documented phenomenon in both primary investigations and review articles. Recent atrophy studies focus on exploring the region-specific patterns of cerebral atrophy; yet, there is no study that analyzes and synthesizes the emerging atrophy patterns in a single comprehensive review. Here we attempt to fill this gap in our current knowledge by integrating the current literature into a cohesive theory of preferential brain tissue loss and by identifying common risk factors for accelerated atrophy progression. Our review reveals that observations for mild traumatic brain injury remain inconclusive, whereas observations for moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury converge towards robust patterns: brain tissue loss is on the order of 5% per year, and occurs in the form of generalized atrophy, across the entire brain, or focal atrophy, in specific brain regions. The most common regions of focal atrophy are the thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum in gray matter and the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and brainstem in white matter. We illustrate the differences of generalized and focal gray and white matter atrophy on emerging deformation and stress profiles across the whole brain using computational simulation. The characteristic features of our atrophy simulations-a widening of the cortical sulci, a gradual enlargement of the ventricles, and a pronounced cortical thinning-agree well with clinical observations. Understanding region-specific atrophy patterns in response to traumatic brain injury has significant implications in modeling, simulating, and predicting injury outcomes. Computational modeling of brain atrophy could open new strategies for physicians to make informed decisions for whom, how, and when to administer pharmaceutical treatment to manage the chronic loss of brain structure and function.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30341741\n\nAbstract\n\nForces generated by the growth cone are vital for the proper development of the axon and thus brain function. Although recent experiments show that forces are generated along the axon, it is unknown whether the axon plays a direct role in controlling growth cone advance. Here, we use analytic and finite element modeling of microtubule dynamics and the activity of the molecular motors myosin and dynein to investigate mechanical force balance along the length of the axon and its effects on axonal outgrowth. Our modeling indicates that the paradoxical effects of stabilizing microtubules and the consequences of microtubule disassembly on axonal outgrowth can be explained by changes in the passive and active mechanical properties of axons. Our findings suggest that a full understanding of growth cone motility requires a consideration of the mechanical contributions of the axon. Our study not only has potential applications during neurodevelopment but might also help identify strategies to manipulate and promote axonal regrowth to treat neurodegeneration.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30309611\n\nAbstract\n\nExcessive physical impacts to the head have direct implications on the structural integrity at the axonal level. Increasing evidence suggests that tau, an intrinsically disordered protein that stabilizes axonal microtubules, plays a critical role in the physical biology of axonal injury. However, the precise mechanisms of axonal damage remain incompletely understood. Here we propose a biophysical model of the axon to correlate the dynamic behavior of individual tau proteins under external physical forces to the evolution of axonal damage. To propagate damage across the scales, we adopt a consistent three-step strategy: First, we characterize the axonal response to external stretches and stretch rates for varying tau crosslink bond strengths using a discrete axonal damage model. Then, for each combination of stretch rates and bond strengths, we average the axonal force-stretch response of n = 10 discrete simulations, from which we derive and calibrate a homogenized constitutive model. Finally, we embed this homogenized model into a continuum axonal damage model of [1-d]-type in which d is a scalar damage parameter that is driven by the axonal stretch and stretch rate. We demonstrate that axonal damage emerges naturally from the interplay of physical forces and biological crosslinking. Our study reveals an emergent feature of the crosslink dynamics: With increasing loading rate, the axonal failure stretch increases, but axonal damage evolves earlier in time. For a wide range of physical stretch rates, from 0.1 to 10 /s, and biological bond strengths, from 1 to 100 pN, our model predicts a relatively narrow window of critical damage stretch thresholds, from 1.01 to 1.30, which agrees well with experimental observations. Our biophysical damage model can help explain the development and progression of axonal damage across the scales and will provide useful guidelines to identify critical damage level thresholds in response to excessive physical forces.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29928193\n\nAbstract\n\nTissue expansion is a common technique in reconstructive surgery used to grow skin in vivo for correction of large defects. Despite its popularity, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how stretch leads to growth of new skin. This has resulted in several arbitrary expansion protocols that rely on the surgeon's personal training and experience rather than on accurate predictive models. For example, choosing between slow or rapid expansion, or small or large inflation volumes remains controversial. Here we explore four tissue expansion protocols by systematically varying the inflation volume and the protocol duration in a porcine model. The quantitative analysis combines three-dimensional photography, isogeometric kinematics, and finite growth theory. Strikingly, all four protocols generate similar peak stretches, but different growth patterns: Smaller filling volumes of 30 ml per inflation did not result in notable expander-induced growth neither for the short nor for the long protocol; larger filling volumes of 60 ml per inflation trigger skin adaptation, with larger expander-induced growth in regions of larger stretch, and more expander-induced growth for the 14-day compared to the 10-day expansion protocol. Our results suggest that expander-induced growth is not triggered by the local stretch alone. While stretch is clearly a driver for growth, the local stretch at a given point is not enough to predict the expander-induced growth at that location. From a clinical perspective, our study suggests that longer expansion protocols are needed to ensure sufficient growth of sizable skin patches.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29627733\n\nAbstract\n\nDrugs often have undesired side effects. In the heart, they can induce lethal arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. The risk evaluation of a new compound is costly and can take a long time, which often hinders the development of new drugs. Here, we establish a high-resolution, multiscale computational model to quickly assess the cardiac toxicity of new and existing drugs. The input of the model is the drug-specific current block from single cell electrophysiology; the output is the spatio-temporal activation profile and the associated electrocardiogram. We demonstrate the potential of our model for a low-risk drug, ranolazine, and a high-risk drug, quinidine: For ranolazine, our model predicts a prolonged QT interval of 19.4% compared with baseline and a regular sinus rhythm at 60.15 beats per minute. For quinidine, our model predicts a prolonged QT interval of 78.4% and a spontaneous development of torsades de pointes both in the activation profile and in the electrocardiogram. Our model reveals the mechanisms by which electrophysiological abnormalities propagate across the spatio-temporal scales, from specific channel blockage, via altered single cell action potentials and prolonged QT intervals, to the spontaneous emergence of ventricular tachycardia in the form of torsades de pointes.

However, fibrillatory activation maps are highly sensitive to far-field effects, and often disagree with other optical mapping modalities. Here we show that computational modeling can identify spurious non-local components of atrial fibrillation electrograms and improve activation mapping. We motivate our approach with a cohort of patients with potential drivers of persistent atrial fibrillation. In a computational study using a monodomain Maleckar model, we demonstrate that in organized rhythms, electrograms successfully track local activation, whereas in atrial fibrillation, electrograms are sensitive to spiral wave distance and number, spiral tip trajectories, and effects of fibrosis. In a clinical study, we analyzed n = 15 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation that was terminated by limited ablation. In five cases, traditional activation maps revealed a spiral wave at sites of termination; in ten cases, electrogram timings were ambiguous and activation maps showed incomplete reentry. By adjusting electrogram timing through computational modeling, we found rotational activation, which was undetectable with conventional methods. Our results demonstrate that computational modeling can identify non-local deflections to improve activation mapping and explain how and where ablation can terminate persistent atrial fibrillation. Our hybrid computational/physiological approach has the potential to optimize map-guided ablation and improve ablation therapy in atrial fibrillation.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29214421\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5880222\n\nAbstract\n\nAxonal damage is a critical indicator for traumatic effects of physical impact to the brain. However, the precise mechanisms of axonal damage are still unclear. Here, we establish a mechanistic and highly dynamic model of the axon to explore the evolution of damage in response to physical forces. Our axon model consists of a bundle of dynamically polymerizing and depolymerizing microtubules connected by dynamically detaching and reattaching cross-links. Although the probability of cross-link attachment depends exclusively on thermal fluctuations, the probability of detachment increases in the presence of physical forces. We systematically probe the landscape of axonal stretch and stretch rate and characterize the overall axonal force, stiffness, and damage as a direct result of the interplay between microtubule and cross-link dynamics. Our simulations reveal that slow loading is dominated by cross-link dynamics, a net reduction of cross-links, and a gradual accumulation of damage, whereas fast loading is dominated by cross-link deformations, a rapid increase in stretch, and an immediate risk of rupture. Microtubule polymerization and depolymerization decrease the overall axonal stiffness, but do not affect the evolution of damage at timescales relevant to axonal failure. Our study explains different failure mechanisms in the axon as emergent properties of microtubule polymerization, cross-link dynamics, and physical forces. We anticipate that our model will provide insight into causal relations by which molecular mechanisms determine the timeline and severity of axon damage after a physical impact to the brain.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29320687\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5773766\n\nAbstract\n\nMagnetic resonance elastography holds promise as a non-invasive, easy-to-use, in vivo biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases. Throughout the past decade, pigs have gained increased popularity as large animal models for human neurodegeneration. However, the volume of a pig brain is an order of magnitude smaller than the human brain, its skull is 40% thicker, and its head is about twice as big. This raises the question to which extent established vibration devices, actuation frequencies, and analysis tools for humans translate to large animal studies in pigs. Here we explored the feasibility of using human brain magnetic resonance elastography to characterize the dynamic properties of the porcine brain. In contrast to humans, where vibration devices induce an anterior-posterior displacement recorded in transverse sections, the porcine anatomy requires a dorsal-ventral displacement recorded in coronal sections. Within these settings, we applied a wide range of actuation frequencies, from 40Hz to 90Hz, and recorded the storage and loss moduli for human and porcine brains. Strikingly, we found that optimal actuation frequencies for humans translate one-to-one to pigs and reliably generate shear waves for elastographic post-processing. In a direct comparison, human and porcine storage and loss moduli followed similar trends and increased with increasing frequency. When translating these frequency-dependent storage and loss moduli into the frequency-independent stiffnesses and viscosities of a standard linear solid model, we found human values of μ1=1.3kPa, μ2=2.1kPa, and η=0.025kPas and porcine values of μ1=2.0kPa, μ2=4.9kPa, and η=0.046kPas. These results suggest that living human brain is softer and less viscous than dead porcine brain. Our study compares, for the first time, magnetic resonance elastography in human and porcine brains, and paves the way towards systematic interspecies comparison studies and ex vivo validation of magnetic resonance elastography as a whole.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28919161\n\nAbstract\n\nA common but serious side effect of many drugs is torsades de pointes, a rhythm disorder that can have fatal consequences. Torsadogenic risk has traditionally been associated with blockage of a specific potassium channel and an increased recovery period in the electrocardiogram. However, the mechanisms that trigger torsades de pointes remain incompletely understood. Here we establish a computational model to explore how drug-induced effects propagate from the single channel, via the single cell, to the whole heart level. Our mechanistic exposure-response simulator translates block-concentration characteristics for arbitrary drugs into three-dimensional excitation profiles and electrocardiogram recordings to rapidly assess torsadogenic risk. For the drug of dofetilide, we show that this risk is highly dose-dependent: at a concentration of 1x, QT prolongation is 55% but the heart maintains its regular sinus rhythm; at 5.7x, QT prolongation is 102% and the heart spontaneously transitions into torsades de points; at 30x, QT prolongation is 132% and the heart adapts a quasi-depolarized state with numerous rapidly flickering local excitations. Our simulations suggest that neither potassium channel blockage nor QT interval prolongation alone trigger torsades de pointes. The underlying mechanism predicted by our model is early afterdepolarization, which translates into pronounced U waves in the electrocardiogram, a signature that is correctly predicted by our model. Beyond the risk assessment of existing drugs, our exposure-response simulator can become a powerful tool to optimize the co-administration of drugs and, ultimately, guide the design of new drugs toward reducing life threatening drug-induced rhythm disorders in the heart.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29493299\n\nAbstract\n\nThe relative effects of skin growth and stretch during tissue expansion have not been studied. The authors use novel analytic techniques that allow calculation of these factors at any point of a skin patch.The authors sought to determine how stretch and growth change with different expansion rates and to correlate these values with histologic and cellular changes in skin.Two minipigs were implanted with a total of 5 tissue expanders under tattooed skin grids. One pig was expanded over 35 days and the second over 15 days. Isogeometric analysis allowed calculation of growth and stretch. Expanders with similar total deformation were compared between protocols. Regression analysis determined predictive effects of stretch and growth on histologic data from the second animal.Deformation was more attributable to stretch in rapid than in slow expansion (1.40 vs1.12, p < .001). Growth was higher in slow expansion than in rapid (1.52 vs 1.07, p < .001). Both growth and stretch predicted epidermal thickness, dermal thinning, and keratinocyte proliferation. Growth predicted vascularity.Isogeometric analysis allows determination of precise surface area changes for correlation to microscopic-level data. Using the model, the authors identified that skin deformation in rapid expansion is more attributable to stretch.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28692604\n\nAbstract\n\nWith 300,000,000 riders annually, roller coasters are a popular recreational activity. Although the number of roller coaster injuries is relatively low, the precise effect of roller coaster rides on our brains remains unknown. Here we present the quantitative characterization of brain displacements and deformations during roller coaster rides. For two healthy adult male subjects, we recorded head accelerations during three representative rides, and, for comparison, during running and soccer headers. From the recordings, we simulated brain displacements and deformations using rigid body dynamics and finite element analyses. Our findings show that despite having lower linear accelerations than sports head impacts, roller coasters may lead to brain displacements and strains comparable to mild soccer headers. The peak change in angular velocity on the rides was 9.9 rad/sec, which was higher than the 5.6 rad/sec in soccer headers with ball velocities reaching 7 m/sec. Maximum brain surface displacements of 4.0 mm and maximum principal strains of 7.6% were higher than in running and similar to soccer headers, but below the reported average concussion strain. Brain strain rates during roller coaster rides were similar to those in running, and lower than those in soccer headers. Strikingly, on the same ride and at a similar position, the two subjects experienced significantly different head kinematics and brain deformation. These results indicate that head motion and brain deformation during roller coaster rides are highly sensitive to individual subjects. Although our study suggests that roller coaster rides do not present an immediate risk of acute brain injury, their long-term effects require further longitudinal study.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28683585\n\nAbstract\n\nAfter birth, the skull grows and remodels in close synchrony with the brain to allow for an increase in intracranial volume. Increase in skull area is provided primarily by bone accretion at the sutures. Additional remodeling, to allow for a change in curvatures, occurs by resorption on the inner surface of the bone plates and accretion on their outer surfaces. When a suture fuses too early, normal skull growth is disrupted, leading to a deformed final skull shape. The leading theory assumes that the main stimulus for skull growth is provided by mechanical stresses. Based on these ideas, we first discuss the dimensional, geometrical, and kinematic synchrony between brain, skull, and suture growth. Second, we present two mechanical models for skull growth that account for growth at the sutures and explain the various observed dysmorphologies. These models demonstrate the particular role of physical and geometrical constraints taking place in skull growth.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.248101\n\nView details for PubMedID 28665667\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the past years, a number cardiac electromechanics models have been developed to better understand the excitation-contraction behavior of the heart. However, there is no agreement on whether inertial forces play a role in this system. In this study, we assess the influence of mass in electromechanical simulations, using a fully coupled finite element model. We include the effect of mechano-electrical feedback via stretch activated currents. We compare five different models: electrophysiology, electromechanics, electromechanics with mechano-electrical feedback, electromechanics with mass, and electromechanics with mass and mechano-electrical feedback. We simulate normal conduction to study conduction velocity and spiral waves to study fibrillation. During normal conduction, mass in conjunction with mechano-electrical feedback increased the conduction velocity by 8.12% in comparison to the plain electrophysiology case. During the generation of a spiral wave, mass and mechano-electrical feedback generated secondary wavefronts, which were not present in any other model. These secondary wavefronts were initiated in tensile stretch regions that induced electrical currents. We expect that this study will help the research community to better understand the importance of mechanoelectrical feedback and inertia in cardiac electromechanics.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29056782\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5646712\n\nAbstract\n\nWrinkling phenomena control the surface morphology of many technical and biological systems. While primary wrinkling has been extensively studied, experimentally, analytically and computationally, higher-order instabilities remain insufficiently understood, especially in systems with stiffness contrasts well below 100. Here, we use the model system of an elastomeric bilayer to experimentally characterize primary and secondary wrinkling at moderate stiffness contrasts. We systematically vary the film thickness and substrate prestretch to explore which parameters modulate the emergence of secondary instabilities, including period-doubling, period-tripling and wrinkle-to-fold transitions. Our experiments suggest that period-doubling is the favourable secondary instability mode and that period-tripling can emerge under disturbed boundary conditions. High substrate prestretch can suppress period-doubling and primary wrinkles immediately transform into folds. We combine analytical models with computational simulations to predict the onset of primary wrinkling, the post-buckling behaviour, secondary bifurcations and the wrinkle-to-fold transition. Understanding the mechanisms of pattern selection and identifying the critical control parameters of wrinkling will allow us to fabricate smart surfaces with tunable properties and to control undesired surface patterns like in the asthmatic airway.This article is part of the themed issue 'Patterning through instabilities in complex media: theory and applications.'\n\nView details for DOI 10.1098/rsta.2016.0163\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000398215500009\n\nView details for PubMedID 28373385\n\nAbstract\n\nNeurons in the central nervous system are surrounded and cross-linked by myelin, a fatty white substance that wraps around axons to create an electrically insulating layer. The electrical function of myelin is widely recognized; yet, its mechanical importance remains underestimated. Here we combined nanoindentation testing and histological staining to correlate brain stiffness to the degree of myelination in immature, pre-natal brains and mature, post-natal brains. We found that both gray and white matter tissue stiffened significantly (p≪0.001) upon maturation: the gray matter stiffness doubled from 0.31±0.20kPa pre-natally to 0.68±0.20kPa post-natally; the white matter stiffness tripled from 0.45±0.18kPa pre-natally to 1.33±0.64kPa post-natally. At the same time, the white matter myelin content increased significantly (p≪0.001) from 58±2% to 74±9%. White matter stiffness and myelin content were correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of ρ=0.92 (p≪0.001). Our study suggests that myelin is not only important to ensure smooth electrical signal propagation in neurons, but also to protect neurons against physical forces and provide a strong microstructural network that stiffens the white matter tissue as a whole. Our results suggest that brain tissue stiffness could serve as a biomarker for multiple sclerosis and other forms of demyelinating disorders. Understanding how tissue maturation translates into changes in mechanical properties and knowing the precise brain stiffness at different stages of life has important medical implications in development, aging, and neurodegeneration.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.04.017\n\nView details for PubMedID 28462864\n\nAbstract\n\nTissue expansion is a popular technique in plastic and reconstructive surgery that grows skin in vivo for correction of large defects such as burns and giant congenital nevi. Despite its widespread use, planning and executing an expansion protocol is challenging due to the difficulty in measuring the deformation imposed at each inflation step and over the length of the procedure. Quantifying the deformation fields is crucial, as the distribution of stretch over time determines the rate and amount of skin grown at the end of the treatment. In this manuscript, we present a method to study tissue expansion in order to gain quantitative knowledge of the deformations induced during an expansion process. This experimental protocol incorporates multi-view stereo and isogeometric kinematic analysis in a porcine model of tissue expansion. Multi-view stereo allows three-dimensional geometric reconstruction from uncalibrated sequences of images. The isogeometric kinematic analysis uses splines to describe the regional deformations between smooth surfaces with few mesh points. Our protocol has the potential to bridge the gap between basic scientific inquiry regarding the mechanics of skin expansion and the clinical setting. Eventually, we expect that the knowledge gained with our methodology will enable treatment planning using computational simulations of skin deformation in a personalized manner.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3791/55052\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000401077600013\n\nView details for PubMedID 28448015\n\nAbstract\n\nFunctional mitral regurgitation, a backward leakage of the mitral valve, is a result of left ventricular growth and mitral annular dilatation. Its gold standard treatment is mitral annuloplasty, the surgical reduction in mitral annular area through the implantation of annuloplasty rings. Recurrent regurgitation rates may, however, be as high as 30% and more. While the degree of annular downsizing has been linked to improved long-term outcomes, too aggressive downsizing increases the risk of ring dehiscences and significantly impairs repair durability. Here, we prototype a virtual sizing tool to quantify changes in annular dimensions, surgically induced tissue strains, mitral annular stretches, and suture forces in response to mitral annuloplasty. We create a computational model of dilated cardiomyopathy onto which we virtually implant annuloplasty rings of different sizes. Our simulations confirm the common intuition that smaller rings are more invasive to the surrounding tissue, induce higher strains, and require larger suture forces than larger rings: The total suture force was 2.2 N for a 24-mm ring, 1.9 N for a 28-mm ring, and 0.8 N for a 32-mm ring. Our model predicts the highest risk of dehiscence in the septal and postero-lateral annulus where suture forces are maximal. These regions co-localize with regional peaks in myocardial strain and annular stretch. Our study illustrates the potential of realistic predictive simulations in cardiac surgery to identify areas at risk for dehiscence, guide the selection of ring size and shape, rationalize the design of smart annuloplasty rings and, ultimately, improve long-term outcomes after surgical mitral annuloplasty.

Computational simulations are a powerful tool to predict the mechanical behavior of the human brain in health and disease. The success of these simulations depends critically on the underlying constitutive model and on the reliable identification of its material parameters. Thus, there is an urgent need to thoroughly characterize the mechanical behavior of brain tissue and to identify mathematical models that capture the tissue response under arbitrary loading conditions. However, most constitutive models have only been calibrated for a single loading mode. Here, we perform a sequence of multiple loading modes on the same human brain specimen - simple shear in two orthogonal directions, compression, and tension - and characterize the loading-mode specific regional and directional behavior. We complement these three individual tests by combined multiaxial compression/tension-shear tests and discuss effects of conditioning and hysteresis. To explore to which extent the macrostructural response is a result of the underlying microstructural architecture, we supplement our biomechanical tests with diffusion tensor imaging and histology. We show that the heterogeneous microstructure leads to a regional but not directional dependence of the mechanical properties. Our experiments confirm that human brain tissue is nonlinear and viscoelastic, with a pronounced compression-tension asymmetry. Using our measurements, we compare the performance of five common constitutive models, neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Demiray, Gent, and Ogden, and show that only the isotropic modified one-term Ogden model is capable of representing the hyperelastic behavior under combined shear, compression, and tension loadings: with a shear modulus of 0.4-1.4kPa and a negative nonlinearity parameter it captures the compression-tension asymmetry and the increase in shear stress under superimposed compression but not tension. Our results demonstrate that material parameters identified for a single loading mode fail to predict the response under arbitrary loading conditions. Our systematic characterization of human brain tissue will lead to more accurate computational simulations, which will allow us to determine criteria for injury, to develop smart protection systems, and to predict brain development and disease progression.There is a pressing need to characterize the mechanical behavior of human brain tissue under multiple loading conditions, and to identify constitutive models that are able to capture the tissue response under these conditions. We perform a sequence of experimental tests on the same brain specimen to characterize the regional and directional behavior, and we supplement our tests with DTI and histology to explore to which extent the macrostructural response is a result of the underlying microstructure. Results demonstrate that human brain tissue is nonlinear and viscoelastic, with a pronounced compression-tension asymmetry, and we show that the multiaxial data can best be captured by a modified version of the one-term Ogden model.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.actbio.2016.10.036\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000393247000027\n\nView details for PubMedID 27989920\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ability to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into cardiomyocytes (CMs) makes them an attractive source for repairing injured myocardium, disease modeling, and drug testing. Although current differentiation protocols yield hPSC-CMs to >90% efficiency, hPSC-CMs exhibit immature characteristics. With the goal of overcoming this limitation, we tested the effects of varying passive stretch on engineered heart muscle (EHM) structural and functional maturation, guided by computational modeling.Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs, H7 line) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs, IMR-90 line) were differentiated to human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) in vitro using a small molecule based protocol. hPSC-CMs were characterized by troponin(+) flow cytometry as well as electrophysiological measurements. Afterwards, 1.2 x 10(6) hPSC-CMs were mixed with 0.4 x 10(6) human fibroblasts (IMR-90 line) (3:1 ratio) and Type-I collagen. The blend was cast into custom-made 12-mm long polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) reservoirs to vary nominal passive stretch of EHMs to 5, 7, or 9 mm. EHM characteristics were monitored for up to 50 days, with EHMs having a passive stretch of 7 mm giving the most consistent formation. Based on our initial macroscopic observations of EHM formation, we created a computational model that predicts the stress distribution throughout EHMs, which is a function of cellular composition, cellular ratio, and geometry. Based on this predictive modeling, we show cell alignment by immunohistochemistry and coordinated calcium waves by calcium imaging. Furthermore, coordinated calcium waves and mechanical contractions were apparent throughout entire EHMs. The stiffness and active forces of hPSC-derived EHMs are comparable to rat neonatal cardiomyocyte-derived EHMs. Three-dimensional EHMs display increased expression of mature cardiomyocyte genes including sarcomeric protein troponin-T, calcium and potassium ion channels, β-adrenergic receptors, and t-tubule protein caveolin-3.Passive stretch affects the structural and functional maturation of EHMs. Based on our predictive computational modeling, we show how to optimize cell alignment and calcium dynamics within EHMs. These findings provide a basis for the rational design of EHMs, which enables future scale-up productions for clinical use in cardiovascular tissue engineering.

Despite extensive research throughout the past decade, the mechanistic origin of these stiffness variations remains elusive. Here we show that brain tissue stiffness is correlated to the underlying tissue microstructure and directly proportional to the local myelin content. In 116 indentation tests of six freshly harvested bovine brains, we found that the cerebral stiffnesses of 1.33±0.63kPa in white matter and 0.68±0.20kPa in gray matter were significantly different (p<0.01). Strikingly, while the inter-specimen variation was rather moderate, the minimum and maximum cerebral white matter stiffnesses of 0.59±0.19 kPa and 2.36±0.64kPa in each brain varied by a factor of four on average. To provide a mechanistic interpretation for this variation, we performed a histological characterization of the tested brain regions. We stained the samples with hematoxylin and eosin and luxol fast blue and quantified the local myelin content using image analysis. Interestingly, we found that the cerebral white matter stiffness increased with increasing myelin content, from 0.72kPa at a myelin content of 64-2.45kPa at a myelin content of 89%, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of ρ=0.91 (p<0.01). This direct correlation could have significant neurological implications. During development, our results could help explain why immature, incompletely myelinated brains are softer than mature, myelinated brains and more vulnerable to mechanical insult as evident, for example, in shaken baby syndrome. During demyelinating disease, our findings suggest to use stiffness alterations as clinical markers for demyelination to quantify the onset of disease progression, for example, in multiple sclerosis. Taken together, our study indicates that myelin might play a more important function than previously thought: It not only insulates signal propagation and improves electrical function of single axons, it also provides structural support and mechanical stiffness to the brain as a whole.Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanical environment of the brain plays an important role in neuronal development and disease. Reported stiffness values vary significantly, but the origin of these variations remains unknown. Here we show that stiffness of our brain is correlated to the underlying tissue microstructure and directly proportional to the local myelin content. Myelin has been discovered in 1854 as an insulating layer around nerve cells to improve electric signal propagation. Our study now shows that it also plays an important mechanical role: Using a combined mechanical characterization and histological characterization, we found that the white matter stiffness increases linearly with increasing myelin content, from 0.5kPa at a myelin content of 63-2.5kPa at 92%.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.actbio.2016.07.040\n\nView details for PubMedID 27475531\n\nAbstract\n\nLiving structures can undergo morphological changes in response to growth and alterations in microstructural properties in response to remodeling.
