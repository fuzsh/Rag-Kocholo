This site also features articles related to the prize: One, for example, describes the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, a German scientific laboratory during the 1930s. Three of its staff members, Otto Meyerhof, Richard Kuhn, and Walther Bothe, received Nobel Prizes. Another explores the life and work of Derek Walcott, the 1992 literature laureate.\n\nFor those interested in the lavish Nobel ceremony and festivities, a collection of pictures and video clips is provided. With the right plug-in, you can take a virtual tour of the Stockholm Concert Hall.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: This page is the official website of the Nobel Foundation. It is supported by external grants from The Knowledge Foundation, The Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation, The Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Cisco Systems, and Aventis Pharma."
