        "text": "Here are the 11 youngest winners of a scientific Nobel Prize, with a quick, interesting ‘did you know’ fact about each of them.\n\nAnd also:\n\n• The teenager whose work won a Nobel Prize in physics.\n\n• The youngest woman to win a science Nobel Prize.\n\n• The youngest winner in each of the three science categories:\n\n• Physics\n\n• Physiology or Medicine\n\n• Chemistry\n\nThe 11 Youngest Nobel Laureates\n\nAge 25: Lawrence Bragg\n\nAustralian-born British physicist.\n\nDid you know? While working as a physics professor in London, Bragg took part-time employment as a gardener, because he enjoyed gardening so much.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAge 31: Werner Heisenberg\n\nGerman theoretical physicist.\n\nDid you know? With his uncertainty principle, Heisenberg showed we can never know everything about a particle exactly. Although Albert Einstein did not like it, Heisenberg showed that God is continuously playing dice with the universe.\n\nAge 31: Paul A.M. Dirac\n\nBritish theoretical physicist.\n\nDid you know? Dirac was a man of few words. He only spoke when it was necessary. In his highly readable biography of Richard Feynman, James Gleick reports a journalist’s interview with Dirac:\n\nJournalist: “Now Doctor, will you give me in a few words the low-down on all your investigations?”\n\nDirac: “No.”\n\nJournalist: “Good. Will it be alright if I put it this way – ‘Professor Dirac solves all the problems of mathematical physics, but is unable to find a better way of figuring out Babe Ruth’s batting average’?”\n\nDirac: “Yes.”\n\nJournalist: “Do you go to the movies?”\n\nDirac: “Yes.”\n\nJournalist: “When?”\n\nDirac: “In 1920 – perhaps also in 1930.”\n\nAge 31: Carl D. Anderson\n\nAmerican physicist.\n\nDid you know? In addition to discovering the positron in 1932, four years later, Anderson discovered the muon.\n\nAge 31: Tsung-Dao Lee\n\nChinese-born American physicist.\n\nDid you know? Lee’s Ph.D. supervisor was Enrico Fermi, who won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of 37.\n\nAge 32: Rudolf Mössbauer\n\nGerman physicist.\n\nDid you know? Mössbauer discovered the Mössbauer effect when, as a Ph.D. student, he ignored his professor’s advice about the experimental equipment he should use.\n\nAge 32: Frederick G. Banting\n\nCanadian surgeon and medical research scientist.\n\nDid you know? Banting failed his first year at university. During World War 1, he was awarded the Military Cross for his heroic actions in helping wounded men.\n\nAge 33: Brian D. Josephson\n\nBritish theoretical physicist.\n\nDid you know? Josephson was still a Ph.D. student, aged 22, when he did the work that led to his Nobel Prize.\n\nAge 33: Joshua Lederberg\n\nAmerican molecular biologist.\n\nDid you know? Joshua Lederberg graduated from high school when he was 15 and was awarded his university degree when he was 19.\n\nAge 34: Donald A. Glaser\n\nAmerican physicist.\n\nDid you know? Glaser was not interested in just physics; he switched fields and became a professor of molecular biology.\n\nAge 34: James Watson\n\nAmerican molecular biologist.\n\nDid you know? Watson was only 15 when he enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.\n\nYoungest Nobel Prize for Chemistry\n\nAge 35: Frédéric Joliot-Curie\n\nFrench chemist/physicist.\n\nDid you know? Frédéric Joliot-Curie changed his name from Joliot to Joliot-Curie when he married Marie Curie’s daughter Irène. Frédéric and Irène shared the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Irène was 38 at the time.\n\nYoungest Scientific Nobel Prize for a Woman\n\nAge 36: Marie Curie\n\nPolish chemist/physicist.\n\nDid you know? Marie Curie also won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. She is the only person to have won both prizes.\n\nYoungest age at which Nobel Prize Winning Work was Carried Out\n\nAge 19: Subramanyan Chandrasekhar\n\nIndian-born American physicist.\n\nDid you know? Chandrasekhar’s uncle was C.V. Raman, who won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of 42.\n\nSumming Up\n\n• If you want to win young, it looks like physics is the best option.\n\n• In recent years it’s been getting harder for ‘youngsters’ to win the Nobel Prize; the most recent Nobel Prize on our list is from over 40 years ago.\n\n• The 11 youngest won in: 1915, 1923, 1932 (twice), 1933, 1938, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1973.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nComments"
