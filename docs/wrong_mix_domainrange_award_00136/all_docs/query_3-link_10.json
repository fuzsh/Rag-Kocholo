        "text": "Walther Bothe was a German physicist born on January 8th, 1891. He was He was the 1954 winner of the prestigious Nobel Prize in physics. He shared the prize with his associate Max Born. The great physicist is best remembered for his contributions towards the “Coincidence Method.” It is with this development that he won the Nobel Prize. Aside from being a physicist, Walther Bothe was a painter as well. Most of his paintings were inspired by mountains.\n\nHe also took piano lessons while he was alive.
