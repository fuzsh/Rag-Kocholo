        "text": "Bonn\n\nIn Bonn, a smaller 1.5 MeV cyclotron was constructed at about the same time as Gentner‚Äôs machine in Heidelberg. Sadly it was destroyed during an allied bomb raid in October 1944.\n\nIt took until 1952, after having learned about alternating-gradient focusing (Chapter 6), that Wolfgang Paul applied for funds to build a 100 MeV electron synchrotron (Chapter 8) in Bonn. Remarkably, the funding agency suggested to increase the energy to 500 MeV. After suitably adapting the application, the project was approved and resulted in the first alternating-gradient synchrotron in Europe . After designing the machine with its 16 m circumference throughout the following years, often with the help of young students, construction commenced in 1955. It took three years until all components were delivered and installed. But then a crisis struck because it was realized that the magnetic field was unsuitable for stable operation. The problem was eventually solved by sandwiching plywood sheets between magnets which sufficiently changed the fields to allow stable operation. By the spring of 1958, first beams were available and even synchrotron radiation was observed. In the following years the beams were directed onto tungsten targets in order to produce ‚Äúbremsstrahlung‚Äù which are just highly energetic gamma rays. By directing these gamma rays onto protons or deuterons and observing the scattering products (Chapter 2) much was learned about the structure of atomic nuclei. The experimental program continued until 1984, when the 500 MeV synchrotron was dismantled to make space for ELSA, discussed below.\n\nAlready a few years after the 500 MeV synchrotron produced beams, the need for a larger electron synchrotron, reaching 2500 MeV, became apparent. Towards the end of 1963, the state government provided funds, such that design of the accelerator could start . With a circumference of almost 70 m it became substantially larger than its smaller brethren. Four years later the first electrons were injected from a 25 MeV linear accelerator into the new synchrotron and accelerated up to the design energy. After a while the beams could even be extracted and directed towards a number of experimental stations, where they impinged on a variety of targets, often containing protons or deuterons. The machine operated in this mode until 1984, at which point the ELectron-Stretcher-Accelerator ELSA was constructed adjacent to the larger synchrotron.\n\nSynchrotrons provide a short burst of beams, typically 50 times per second, but many experiments desire a continuous stream of electrons. One solution is to inject the short burst into a larger so-called stretcher ring. In this ring one or several pulses from the synchrotron are collected before the stored electrons are slowly extracted and guided to experiments. The project already went under way in the early 1980s, but it took until 1989 to complete the construction of ELSA with its circumference of 164 m and to connect it to the larger synchrotron that was used as an injector. Once the electrons were inside ELSA, they could be slowly extracted, just as was initially planned. Even accelerating the beams and extracting them at higher energies became possible. Finally, beams could be accumulated in ELSA and stored for several hours to provide synchrotron radiation. In this way, ELSA doubled up as a synchrotron light source (Section 13.1).\n\nMuch expertise was generated by constructing the smaller synchrotron, being the first of its kind. And that competence came handy when a larger synchrotron was planned in Hamburg.\n\nDESY\n\nBy 1955 Germany had regained part of its sovereignty and was permitted to create a ministry for nuclear energy. Moreover, this new ministry was willing to fund an institute for research in particle physics; the creation of CERN in Geneva the previous year served as a inspiration. Incidentally, at that time Hamburg University offered a professorship to the US-based Austrian scientist Willibald Jentschke, who accepted after being granted substantial funds to create a new department, which served as the nucleus for what would later become DESY .\n\nThe type of accelerator was settled at a conference in Geneva the following year. Instead of a proton synchrotron, which would be in direct competition with the accelerator at CERN (Chapter 6), Jentschke decided to build an electron synchrotron (Chapter 8) with the unprecedented energy of 6 GeV, more than ten times the energy of the first synchrotron in Bonn. During the following years negotiations between federal and state agencies led to the constitution of the ‚ÄúDeutsches Elektronen SYnchrotron‚Äù DESY in December 1959. An abandoned airfield in the suburb of Bahrenfeld was selected as the site to house a 40 MeV linear accelerator, used as injector, and the 300 m long synchrotron. It took until 1964 for the first beams to be accelerated. Fifty times per second a new batch reached top energy, was ejected from the synchrotron, and directed towards experimental stations.\n\nThe first experiments pointed the electrons onto hydrogen-rich targets and analyzed the scattering products in spectrometers, conceptually similar to Hofstadter‚Äôs experiments discussed in Chapter 7. A second group of experiments directed the electrons onto a target where they produce gamma-ray photons that are then impinged onto protons. Subsequently the photon-induced reactions and scattering products are analyzed. A third group of experiments directed the electrons into a bubble chamber (Figure 5.5), photographing the tracks, and analyzing the reactions that show up. Right after beams became available, the copious synchrotron radiation emitted by the 6 GeV electrons was characterized and used for first experiments.\n\nAlready a few years after the synchrotron started to operate, ideas were discussed to build a second accelerator in which electrons and positrons would circulate in opposite directions and collide head-on (Figure 8.1). In this way much more energy would become available for new particles to emerge from the fireball at the collision points. There detectors stood by to record the escaping particles. At the time it was deemed advantageous to store electrons and positrons in separate rings, mounted on top of each other. This new storage ring was given the name DORIS (derived from the German ‚ÄúDOppel-RIng Speicher‚Äù). It had a circumference of 288 m and initially stored electrons and positrons with energies of up to 3 GeV.\n\nTowards the end of 1974, the two detectors PLUTO and DASP were placed in their respective collision points. At just this time SLAC and Brookhaven discovered the very sharp resonance made of charm and anticharm quark (Chapter 8), an event later referred to as the ‚ÄúNovember revolution.‚Äù DORIS verified these discoveries within a very short time and then successfully searched for mesons consisting of one charm and one other quark. Later it engaged in the detailed analysis of many bound states, an activity that was dubbed ‚Äúcharmonium spectroscopy.‚Äù Just as upgrading DORIS to higher energies was under way, the Upsilon as a bound state of two bottom quarks was discovered at Fermilab in 1977 (Chapter 9). Luckily the magnets were already somewhat over-designed from the beginning and could handle the higher energies. Nevertheless, additional components and smart ideas were asked for to eventually reach close to 5 GeV per beam which made the production of Upsilons possible. Observing their decay into muon and electron pairs were important ingredients to determine the charge of the bottom quark. DORIS then embarked on a campaign to determine other properties of the quarks and the strong interaction.\n\nIn order to consolidate operating at higher energies DORIS was upgraded in 1982 to reemerge as DORIS II. It now stored electrons and positrons in a single ring, rather than the ‚ÄúDoppel-ring‚Äù that gave DORIS its name. The higher energies of 5.6 GeV per beam allowed the two new detectors, ARGUS and Crystal Ball, to investigate pairs of BùêµBitalic_B-mesons and their antiparticles B¬Ø¬Øùêµ\\bar{B}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_B end_ARG, each containing a bottom quark and one other quark. This led to the first observation of BùêµBitalic_B-B¬Ø¬Øùêµ\\bar{B}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_B end_ARG-mixing, a process closely linked to the prevalence of matter over antimatter in our universe that is referred to as CP-violation (Chapter 10).\n\nAll the time, the number of synchrotron-radiation users increased. A large laboratory building housing their experiments was completed by 1982 and was dubbed ‚ÄúHasylab,‚Äù derived from ‚ÄúHAmburger SYnchrotron LABoratory.‚Äù Increasing demands led to yet another upgrade to DORIS III in 1991, now equipped with an outward-bulging no-longer-straight section. There five wigglers and undulators (Section 13.1) were installed to increase the flux and the quality of the emitted synchrotron radiation. By that time most particle physics activities concentrated on the next-generation colliders PETRA and HERA such that from 1993 until 2012 DORIS operated solely to produce synchrotron radiation. Research highlights include Ada Yonath‚Äôs studies of ribosomes, the engines that produce proteins in cells.\n\nAlready by the time DORIS was starting up, discussions about the next generation of accelerators were picking up speed and converged towards the electron-positron collider PETRA (from the German ‚ÄúPositron-Electron Tandem RingbeschleunigerAnlage‚Äù). With a circumference of 2.3 km it was the largest ring that would fit onto the DESY site. It should reach more than 20 GeV per beam and provide four collision points for experiments housing the detectors TASSO, MARK J, JADE, and PLUTO; the latter was later replaced by CELLO. Approval came in 1975 and less than three years later the beams were colliding. The hope to find the sixth quark, called top, remained unfulfilled. It turned out to be much too heavy for PETRA and other rings of similar size. Instead, the highlight of research on PETRA was the discovery of gluons through the observation of three-jet events (Figure 8.7), already mentioned towards the end of Chapter 8. Many careful measurements revealed intricate details of subatomic interactions and contributed to establishing quantum chromodynamics as a valid theory of the strong interaction (Chapter 7). Moreover, many aspects of the electroweak interaction (Chapter 6) were explored. The experimental program continued until the end of 1986. At that time PETRA was needed as injector for an even larger ring, the ‚ÄúHadron-Electron Ring Accelerator‚Äù HERA.\n\nAfter plans to add a proton ring inside the PETRA tunnel were abandoned, a proposal to build a new 6.3 km long underground tunnel was put forward. This tunnel would house HERA comprising a 820 GeV proton and a 30 GeV electron ring. Head-on collisions of electrons and protons at these energies would allow the experimenters to probe the inside of the proton much more accurately than was possible in the deep-inelastic scattering experiments at SLAC (Chapter 8). After a period of negotiations the project was approved in 1984 and construction could start. A large tunnel-boring machine, similar to the one that dug the tunnel of LEP (Chapter 10) drilled the 6.3 km long tunnel 10 m to 20 m below the surface. The DESY synchrotron, rebuilt and called DESY II, as well as PETRA were used to accelerate the electrons. Accelerating protons, on the other hand, was new for DESY and a second synchrotron for protons, called DESY III, was installed alongside the venerable electron synchrotron. Additional components were added to PETRA, now called PETRA II, that allowed it to accelerate protons. The electron ring of HERA is fairly conventional, but the magnets for the proton ring had to be superconducting in order to fit the high-energy beams into the tunnel, just as the Tevatron needed superconducting magnets at Fermilab (Chapter 9). After meticulous development work at DESY the manufacture of the 750 up to 9 m long magnets was transferred to industry, half in Germany, the other half in Italy. The magnets were cooled to low temperatures by the, at the time, largest Helium liquefaction plant in Europe. After installing and testing many more components, HERA was inaugurated towards the end of 1990. Commissioning all subsystems, including the detectors H1 and ZEUS, took more time but by 1992 first collisions were observed. Later even two additional detectors, HERA-B and HERMES, were installed.\n\nThe detectors extended the deep-inelastic scattering results, pioneered at the SLAC linac, to much smaller distances inside the proton, thereby validating the standard model. In particular, the momentum distribution of the quarks inside protons was measured with unprecedented accuracy. Moreover, there appeared to be additional quark-antiquark pairs bouncing around inside protons. Even previously unseen reactions that have their origin in the weak interaction were found; only a single shower of hadrons appeared besides an unobservable neutrino. Its existence was inferred by balancing the energy and the momentum of the observed ejectiles. Experiments in HERA continued until 2007, when the accelerator was turned off, because DESY started to build the European XFEL, a large free-electron laser (Section 13.2) to produce X-rays. With HERA turned off, PETRA was no longer needed as injector and one octant was be refurbished to house undulators that generate copious amounts of high-quality synchrotron radiation. The rebuilt machine was called PETRA III. As of 2024, even a further upgrade, called PETRA IV, to improve the amount and quality of the emitted radiation, is actively discussed.\n\nThe work towards the XFEL started from designing a linear electron-positron collider (Chapter 12) called TESLA, that would use superconducting accelerating structures (Chapter 10). In order to broaden the number of users beyond the particle physics community, an X-ray free-electron laser was added to the proposal; it would serve the community of synchrotron radiation users. In order to test the concept‚Äîboth the accelerating structures and the free-electron laser‚Äîa 100 m long superconducting linac accelerated beams to about 250 MeV and passed them through a 13 m long undulator magnet. With all parameters tuned just right, the machine would emit a high-intensity free-electron laser pulse (Section 13.2). This Tesla-Test Facility (TTF) was constructed on the DESY site and produced very short-wavelength light pulses in 2000. Shortly afterwards the machine, renamed FLASH (for ‚ÄúFree-Electron LASer in Hamburg‚Äù), was rebuilt to increase the energy to 1000 MeV. Moreover, a new undulator, now 30 m long, led to first lasing at much shorter wavelengths by 2004. Continued upgrades and an additional undulator have vastly enhanced the capabilities of FLASH. In one of the many experimental highlights the scattered light from a microscopic sample was processed to reconstruct the sample with high fidelity; a precursor to determine the structure of many otherwise inaccessible biomolecules.\n\nBut originally TTF was constructed to develop the superconducting accelerating structures that were successfully used in TTF and FLASH. Despite this success the application to build TESLA was turned down. Instead, based on the success of the free-electron laser program, the funding agencies supported the construction of a much larger version of FLASH, the European XFEL. About two thirds of this 3.2 km long machine is filled with superconducting structures to reach beam energies close to 20 GeV. The last third is filled with several-hundred-meter-long undulator magnets that produce ultra-short and super-intense pulses of X-rays. Since the completion of the facility in 2017, this radiation permits experimenters to investigate the structure of proteins, make time-resolved measurements (‚Äúmovies‚Äù) of chemical reactions, and explore matter under extreme conditions.\n\nAt DESY, a particle physics lab was slowly converted to one that pursues synchrotron radiation research. In Berlin, on the other hand, a facility dedicated to the generation of this radiation right from the start was constructed.\n\nBESSY in Berlin\n\nBy 1975, both the accelerators in Bonn and Hamburg were producing synchrotron radiation, quasi on the side, but the demand was growing. As a consequence a review was conducted and found that two storage rings, dedicated to the production of synchrotron radiation, were needed. A larger one for the production of X-rays that turned out to be DORIS and a smaller machine to generate radiation with lower energies. The formal decision to build the latter came in 1979 and construction of BESSY (derived from ‚ÄúBerliner ElektronenSpeicherring Gesellschaft f√ºr SYnchrotronstrahlung‚Äù) soon commenced . Less than three years later, beams, accelerated in a small pre-accelerator, and an injector synchrotron to 800 MeV, were injected into the BESSY storage ring having a circumference of 62 m. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the beam quality and intensity were improved and with it the quality of the synchrotron radiation that escaped the beam pipe through 35 windows. Highlights of the instrumental developments are new types of undulator magnets (Section 13.1) and methods to ensure the quality of optical components that guide and focus the synchrotron light on its way to the experimental stations.\n\nHighlights of the experimental program are Peter Gr√ºnberg‚Äôs experiments on what was later called giant magnetoresistance. This effect led the way to vastly increased storage capacities of hard drives in our computers and was honored with a Nobel Prize in Physics . Surface physics and catalysis are other fields of endeavor that were pursued at BESSY. These phenomena are tremendously important to facilitate difficult chemical reactions, such as converting toxic gases in car exhausts to more benign chemicals. The high impact of this research contributed to Gerhard Ertl‚Äôs Nobel Prize in Chemistry .\n\nThe distribution of wavelengths‚Äîthe spectrum‚Äîand the intensity of the emitted radiation can be calculated from first principles and only depends on very few beam parameters. Since those quantities can be very accurately measured, the emitted radiation is known with high confidence and can be used to calibrate other measurement devices, such as spectrometers. These activities were driven under the auspices of the German authority for measurements, abbreviated PTB . In particular, they were responsible for the calibration of instruments for two space-telescopes, SOHO and Chandra. The accelerator operated until 1999 and was then packed up and shipped to Jordan, where it was reassembled and now serves as injector for SESAME, the first synchrotron light source in the middle-east.\n\nA few years after the first BESSY storage ring started to produce light in the early 1980s, proposals for several so-called third-generation light sources with vastly improved quality and intensities were discussed world-wide. Such an accelerator would be several times larger than BESSY and would not fit within the limits of the original site in West-Berlin. With the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, however, new options appeared and a site in former East-Berlin was chosen to become the home of BESSY-II . Construction started in 1993 and five years later an injector synchrotron filled the new BESSY-II storage ring, having a circumference of 240 m and operating at 1.7 GeV for the first time. A year later first photons, produced in special undulator magnets but also in the magnets that keep the beam on its circular path, were served to users. The photons follow a straight path and escape from the beam pipe to travel via more than forty so-called synchrotron beam lines towards the experimental stations.\n\nWith higher beam energies, radiation in the X-ray region could be produced. It was used to analyze the structure of materials and of proteins. Even the structure of proteins of the Covid virus were determined at BESSY-II. A further very active field of research addresses materials for new batteries and for high-temperature superconductors. Both aspects are particularly relevant to improve the efficiency of energy utilization. Even the PTB continues to calibrate instruments with the help of BESSY-II, especially at higher photon energies. The reduced availability of lower-energy photons caused the PTB to construct a second smaller ring, the ‚ÄúMetrology Light Source‚Äù (MLS) adjacent to the BESSY-II site.\n\nConstruction of the MLS started in 2004 and first beams became available in 2008, predominantly for metrology applications, such as calibrating spectrometers but also other sources of light used in industrial processes or in scientific applications. The MLS has a circumference of 48 m and stores electron beams with energies between 105 MeV and 630 MeV. Remarkably, the MLS reproducibly stores beam intensities ranging from a single electron to several ten billions of electrons, with the intensity of the emitted radiation covering the corresponding range. Moreover, the synchrotron radiation covers the far infrared to the extreme ultraviolet. It thus extends from far below the visible spectrum to significantly above. Since the properties of the emitted radiation can be calculated from first principles, the MLS serves as a ‚Äústandard candle‚Äù to calibrate other sources or spectrometers.\n\nBessy and DESY were not the only laboratories producing synchrotron radiation. Towards the end of the millennium, mid-size electron accelerators appeared in several other places, among them Dortmund.\n\nGSI and FAIR\n\nDuring the 1960s accelerators for heavy ions were discussed as tools to analyze nuclear matter with methods that were complementary to those of high-energy proton or electron accelerators that were used to look inside protons and other sub-nuclear particles at the time. Instead, the new facility would focus on the collective behavior of large numbers of protons and neutrons inside heavier nuclei. As a consequence of these discussions, the ‚ÄúGesellschaft f√ºr SchwerIonenforschung‚Äù (GSI) was founded in 1969 and the construction of the approximately 120 m long linear accelerator, called UNILAC, soon started. It was based on drift tubes developed by Wideroe (Figure 4.2) and Alvarez (Figure 5.3). However, with a diameter of 1.2 m the vacuum vessel is much larger. By 1975 it accelerated beams up to energies of 11 MeV per nucleon. The total energy of uranium with 238 nucleons (92 protons and 146 neutrons) is therefore in the GeV range. At these energies the speed of the uranium ions is about 16 % of the speed of light. Soon experiments in two experimental areas commenced by impinging the heavy-ion beams onto targets. Detectors then analyze whatever scattering products escape from the point of impact.\n\nOf particular interest is the distribution of fragments with different numbers of protons and neutrons (isotopes) that are created in the collision, because it shows how the nucleons are organized inside the nucleus. Thereby it probes the organization of nucleons into shells . These experiments help us to better understand the stability of nuclei, especially in extreme situations as they occur in very heavy nuclei. Some of the lighter isotopes feature in the creation of heavier elements inside stars and supernovae, a process called ‚Äúnucleosynthesis‚Äù. In particular, measuring their masses and lifetimes helps us understand the relative abundance of different elements in our universe.\n\nThe heaviest naturally occurring element on the periodic table is uranium with atomic number 92. Since the 1940s heavier elements, so-called transuranium elements, were created in nuclear reactors and in accelerators. Once the UNILAC was up and running, it joined the search for previously unseen heavier elements. And indeed, between 1981 and 1984, the three elements with atomic numbers 107, 108, and 109 were discovered at GSI. Bohrium with atomic number 107, for example, was created by slamming chromium ions into a bismuth target and then filtering the debris to select particles with a specific mass using an elaborate setup of magnetic and electric fields, called SHIP, short for ‚ÄúSeparator for Heavy Ion Products.‚Äù Other combinations of beams and targets were used to create the other new elements. And about ten years later, between 1994 and 1996, the team at GSI repeated their success and found elements 110, 111, and 112 . In the decade between the element discoveries, many other experiments were performed and, most importantly, the facility was upgraded by adding a synchrotron and a storage ring.\n\nAlready in the early 1980s, different options to increase the energy of the beams were discussed and finally converged on a synchrotron (Chapter 5), for technical reasons called SIS18, and the ESR, short for ‚ÄúExperimentier SpeicherRing.‚Äù SIS18 has a circumference of 216 m and increases the energy of beams by large factors. At the same time their speed increases from 16 % to 90 % of the speed of light. The accelerated beams are then directed onto a target and the debris is filtered by a special beam line consisting of magnets and thin absorbers, called FRS, short for ‚ÄúFRagment Separator.‚Äù Only one specific nucleus containing a particular number of protons and neutrons (a specific isotope) emerges at the exit of FRS and is injected into the ESR with half the circumference of SIS18. In the ESR a stochastic cooling system (Figure 9.4) improves the beam quality of the injected ions. Additionally, an electron cooler superimposes a high-quality electron beam with the stored ion beam. This allows the ions to bounce off the electrons and thereby lose some of their random motion. This process then slowly ‚Äúcools‚Äù the ions and makes it possible to measure their revolution frequency with very high precision from which the mass of the injected isotope can be derived. This method was used to analyze a wide variety of isotopes thus improving our understanding of nuclear matter.\n\nSince the early 1990s, GSI explored the use of ion beams to treat cancer. Especially carbon ions showed a distinct advantage over conventional therapy with X-rays or electrons, because the carbon ions cause much more damage in deep-seated tumors while causing less harm in surrounding healthy tissue. The depth of the tumor-damage can be adjusted by adjusting the energy of the SIS18 synchrotron. The extension of the tumor in the sideways directions is covered by raster-scanning the ion beam with the help of magnets. During the process that destroys a tumor, positrons are created that annihilate with nearby electrons and give rise to two characteristic X-ray photons that reveal their point of origin. In this positron-emission tomographic (PET) process the deposited dose is verified while the patient is treated. The pilot project at GSI was such a success that a similar facility comprising synchrotron and raster-scanning target system was built in Heidelberg and treats patients from 2009 onwards. A few years later similar systems started operating in Marburg, Shanghai (China), Pavia (Italy), and Vienna (Austria).\n\nOnce SIS18 and the ESR were in operation in the mid-1990s, discussions started about the future needs of the nuclear physics community. It came up with a proposal for the ‚ÄúFacility for Antiproton and Ion Research‚Äù (FAIR) . The funding agencies recommended to jointly construct the facility with international partners. By 2010, all partners signed an agreement and FAIR was officially founded. It still took several years until construction began. Unfortunately it was delayed further due to massive increases in the cost, the covid pandemic, and the Russian war in Ukraine. By the time of writing construction, albeit on a reduced scope, is ongoing.\n\nFor FAIR, all the existing accelerators at GSI are upgraded and will become part of the injector complex for the large synchrotron SIS100. With a circumference of 1100 m it is about five times larger than SIS18 and reaches about five times higher energies. Beams extracted from SIS100 are guided to several experimental areas; one of them is the Super-FRS, a large fragment separator to isolate exotic isotopes. The ‚ÄúCollector Ring‚Äù CR collects these isotopes and makes detailed studies of their properties possible, just as the ESR was used to analyze isotopes produced in the FRS. In parallel to the Super-FRS, proton beams from SIS100 can be directed to an antiproton-production (p¬Ø¬Øùëù\\bar{p}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_p end_ARG) target. Also the antiprotons are collected in the CR. Once their beam quality is increased, they are directed to the ‚ÄúHigh-Energy Storage Ring‚Äù (HESR) where they are stored for hours and collide with a hydrogen target inside the PANDA detector.\n\nThe physics program of FAIR comprises four topics, labeled NUSTAR, PANDA, CBM, and APPA . NUSTAR is focused on exploiting the Super-FRS and determines the masses and lifetimes of rare isotopes that play an important role for the creation of heavier elements in stars and during supernova explosions. PANDA explores the spectrum of hadrons that include a charm quark and tries to find bound states of gluons, so-called glueballs. Since the mass of the quarks alone does not account for the mass of, for example, protons, PANDA tries to find explanations based on quantum chromodynamics. CBM will crash the full-energy beam coming from SIS100 into a target inside a dedicated cave. There conditions are recreated that resemble those immediately after the Big Bang when the primordial quark-gluon plasma condensed into the first hadrons. APPA explores how high-energy particles affect matter relevant to life sciences and material sciences. For example the impinging particles can form nanopores that serve as filters to separate smaller from larger compounds.\n\nNot far from the FAIR site, in Frankfurt and in Mainz, two institutes pursue development work that directly contributes to GSI and FAIR. The ‚ÄúInstitute for Applied Physics‚Äù at Frankfurt University develops accelerating structures, especially for the new linear accelerator HELIAC. It will take over the super-heavy element production from the venerable UNILAC, once the latter is dedicated to FAIR. The ‚ÄúHelmholtz Institute‚Äù in Mainz integrates the structures into HELIAC and works on a new electron cooler for the HESR to produce high-quality beams for PANDA."
