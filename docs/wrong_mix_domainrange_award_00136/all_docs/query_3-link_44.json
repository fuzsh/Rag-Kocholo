Specifically, we extract the attainable sensitivities for motivated scenarios such as neutrino generalized interactions (NGIs), the sterile neutrino dipole portal and unitarity violation. We furthermore examine the impact of the τ-optimized flux at the DUNE-ND and compare our results with those obtained using the standard CP-optimized flux. We find that our present analysis is probing a previously unexplored region of the parameter space, complementing existing results from cosmological observations and terrestrial experiments.

In fact, it is known that even in the absence of a radioactive source, the instrument detects what is known as background radiation, which consists of various types of ionizing particles present in the environment. Remarkably, it is estimated that up to 15% of this background radiation is attributable to cosmic rays, high-energy particles originating from outer space. The remaining radiation detected by the Geiger counter originates from terrestrial sources, such as natural radioactivity in the ground and in the air. The main goal of this project is to build a muon detector for scientific and educational purposes using two commercial DIY Geiger counter kits and just a few additional components. To identify cosmic radiation from terrestrial radiation and improve the accuracy of cosmic ray measurements, the use of a coincident circuit is essential. This coincident circuit was introduced in cosmic ray physics by Walther Bothe and Bruno Rossi in the early 1930s and allows for the detection of a subatomic particle passing through two or more sensors, thereby reducing false positives and enhancing the reliability of cosmic ray detection. The following idea is an alternative replica of our AMD5 detectors, instruments that we have been using for years to teach and perform scientific experiments in the cosmic ray field under the umbrella of the ADA project (2023 Particles, Arcani et al.). The resulting device, named AMD5ALI, offers a reliable and inexpensive solution for the same goal, making it a valuable tool for both educational purposes and scientific surveys. Practical applications range from cosmic ray physics to radioactivity, including the relationship between cosmic ray flux and meteorology, the zenithal effect, the Regener–Pfotzer curve in the atmosphere, and the anti-correlation of cosmic particle intensity with solar activity.

More importantly, DSM has been used recently with good success in calculating nuclear structure factors, which are needed for a variety of weak interaction processes. In this article, in addition to giving an overview of this, we discuss the applications of DSM to obtain cross-sections for coherent and incoherent neutrino nucleus scattering on 96,98,100Mo targets and also for obtaining two neutrino double beta decay nuclear transition matrix elements for 100Mo.

Two other frequencies were found by Borra in the redshift-corrected SDSS galactic spectra, f1,G=9.71−0.19+0.20 THz and f2,G=9.17−0.16+0.18 THz; the latter was then shown by Hippke to be a spurious frequency introduced by the data analysis procedure. Results: Within the experimental errors, the frequency f1,G is the beating of the two frequencies, the spurious one, f2,G and fS that was also independently detected in a real solar spectrum, but not in the Kurucz’s artificial solar spectrum by Hippke, suggesting that fS could actually be a real frequency. Independent SETI observations by Isaacson et al., taken at different epochs, of four of these 236 stars could not confirm with high confidence—without completely excluding—the presence of fS in their power spectra and with the same power initially observed. Instead, the radio SETI deep-learning analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) gave an indirect confirmation of the presence of fS through the detection of a narrowband Doppler drifting of the observed radio signals in two stars, over a sample of 7 with a high S/N. These two stars belong to the set of the 236 SDSS stars. Numerical simulations confirm that this drifting can be due to frequency and phase modulation in time of the observed frequencies (1.3–1.7 GHz) with fS. Conclusions: Assuming the DM hypothesis, the upper mass limit of the axion-like DM particle is ma≃2.4×103μeV, in agreement with the results from the gamma ray burst GRB221009A, laser interferometry experiments, suggesting new physics with additional axion-like particle fields for the muon g-2 anomaly.

Analytical formulas for the masses of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axialvector meson states are derived assuming global chiral symmetry. The various eLSM parameters are analytically deduced and numerically computed. This enables accurate estimations of the masses of sixteen noncharmed and thirteen charmed meson states at vanishing temperature. The comparison of these results to a recent compilation of the particle data group (PDG) allows us to draw the conclusion that the masses of sixteen noncharmed and thirteen charmed meson states calculated in the eLSM are in good agreement with the PDG. This shows that the eLSM, with its configurations and parameters, is an effective theoretical framework for determining the mass spectra of various noncharmed and charmed meson states, particularly at vanishing temperature.

When applying this formalism to the particular case of a Lagrange top, in the formulation with a diagonal inertia tensor the potential energy has a more complicated form as compared with that assumed in the literature on dynamics of a rigid body. This implies the corresponding improvements in equations of motion. Therefore, we revised this case, presenting several examples of analytical solutions to the improved equations. The case of precession without nutation has a surprisingly rich relationship between the rotation and precession rates, which is discussed in detail.

A particular interest is devoted to secondary-to-primary ratios of light isotopic components of CRs, the measurement of which can provide complementary information with respect to secondary-to-primary ratios like B/C. Given the complexity of the concurrent measurement of velocity and momentum required to differentiate isotopes of the same Z, a task typically accomplished using magnetic spectrometers, existing measurements of these ratios only effectively characterize the low-energy region (below 1 GeV/nucl). This study introduces a novel technique for isotopic distinction in CRs at high energies up to 100 GeV/nucl based on multiple scattering, which, combined with the proposed measurement of velocity, represent an interesting alternative to magnetic spectrometers. The performance of this technique was assessed through a dedicated simulation using the GEANT4 package, with specific emphasis on Z = 1 isotopes.

Since it is a renormalization group invariant that is constant in the process of cosmic evolution, we can show conservation of entropy, which is an ansatz in the standard cosmology. Here, we study renormalizable quantum gravity that exhibits conformal dominance at high energy beyond the Planck scale. The current entropy of the universe is derived by calculating the effective action under the scenario of quantum gravity inflation caused by its dynamics. We then argue that ghost modes must be unphysical but are necessary for the Hamiltonian to vanish and for entropy to exist in gravitational systems.

The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) can identify singly charged isotopes up to about 10 GeV/n. However, their identification presents challenges due to the small abundance of CR deuterons compared to the proton background. In particular, a high accuracy for the velocity measured by a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) is needed to achieve a good isotopic mass separation over a wide range of energies. The velocity measurement with the RICH is particularly challenging for Z=1 isotopes due to the low number of photons produced in the Cherenkov rings. This faint signal is easily disrupted by noisy hits leading to a misreconstruction of the particles’ ring. Hence, an efficient background reduction process is needed to ensure the quality of the reconstructed Cherenkov rings and provide a correct measurement of the particles’ velocity. Machine learning methods, particularly boosted decision trees, are well suited for this task, but their performance relies on the choice of the features needed for their training phase. While physics-driven feature selection methods based on the knowledge of the detector are often used, machine learning algorithms for automated feature selection can provide a helpful alternative that optimises the classification method’s performance. We compare five algorithms for selecting the feature samples for RICH background reduction, achieving the best results with the Random Forest method. We also test its performance against the physics-driven selection method, obtaining better results.

In particular, we present an extended approach to non-local QCD and a complete revision of the technique of Bender, Milton and Savage applied to non-local theories, providing a set of Dyson–Schwinger equations in differential form. In the local case, we obtain closed-form solutions in the simplest case of the scalar field and extend it to the Yang–Mills field. In general, for non-local theories, we use a perturbative technique and a Fourier series and show how higher-order harmonics are heavily damped due to the presence of the non-local factor. The spectrum of the theory is analysed for the non-local Yang–Mills sector and found to be in agreement with the local results on the lattice in the limit of the non-locality mass parameter running to infinity. In the non-local case, we confine ourselves to a non-locality mass that is sufficiently large compared to the mass scale arising from the integration of the Dyson–Schwinger equations. Such a choice results in good agreement, in the proper limit, with the spectrum of the local theory. We derive a gap equation for the fermions in the theory that gives some indication of quark confinement in the non-local NJL case as well. Confinement seems to be a rather ubiquitous effect that removes some degrees of freedom in the original action, favouring the appearance of new observable states, as seen, e.g., for quantum chromodynamics at lower energies.

The facility utilizes an S-band radio-frequency (RF) gun and a linear accelerator (linac) to generate and accelerate electron bunches. These electron bunches are accelerated in the RF gun and the linac using RF pulses with a frequency of 2856 MHz. Measuring the RF properties becomes essential, as the RF pulse information can be utilized to estimate the electron beam properties. To achieve the measurement results, we employed an RF measurement system comprising directional couplers, coaxial cables, attenuators, a crystal detector, and an oscilloscope. Prior to conducting measurements, the crystal detector and RF equipment were calibrated and characterized to ensure precise and reliable results. The electron beam energy estimation using the measured RF power was compared with the measured beam energies. The gun and the linac were operated with an absorbed RF power of 1.52 MW and an input power of 1.92 MW, respectively. The estimated electron beam energies were found to be 2.18 MeV and 15.0 MeV, respectively, closely aligning with the measured beam energies of 2.1 MeV and 14.0 MeV after the gun and linac acceleration. These consistent energy values support the reliability of our RF power measurement system and procedure.

Upcoming measurements will reduce the experimental uncertainty of this observable by a factor of four; therefore, the theoretical precision must improve accordingly to fully harness such an experimental breakthrough. With regards to the HLbL contribution, this implies a study of the high-energy intermediate states that are neglected in dispersive estimates. We focus on the maximally symmetric high-energy regime and in-quark loop approximation of perturbation theory, following the method of the OPE with background fields proposed by Bijnens et al. in 2019 and 2020. We confirm their results regarding the contributions to the muon g−2. For this, we use an alternative computational method based on a reduction in the full quark loop amplitude, instead of projecting on a supposedly complete system of tensor structures motivated by first principles. Concerning scalar coefficients, mass corrections have been obtained by hypergeometric representations of Mellin–Barnes integrals. By our technique, the completeness of such kinematic singularity/zero-free tensor decomposition of the HLbL amplitude is explicitly checked.

Therefore, the time variations in dimensional constants lack operational significance due to their dependence on these dimensional constants. They are well structured and represent a valid discussion. However, this fact only becomes a meaningful debate within the context of a static or present Universe. As theoretically and observationally well established, the current Universe is undergoing accelerated expansion, wherein dimensional quantities, like the wavelength of light, also experience redshift phenomena elongating over cosmic time. In other words, in an expanding Universe, dimensional quantities of physical parameters vary with cosmic time. From this perspective, there exists the possibility that dimensional constants, such as the speed of light, could vary with the expansion of the Universe. In this review paper, we contemplate under what circumstances the speed of light may change or remain constant over cosmic time and discuss the potential for distinguishing these cases observationally.

We propose a definition of the presence of DE in the Universe and a criterion for what can be considered the source of this dark energy. It is based on the idea of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, which requires antigravity caused by large negative pressure. A recently proposed hypothesis, that the mass of BHs increases with time according to the same law as the volume of the part of the Universe containing it and the population of BHs can mimic DE, is examined. We demonstrate the reasons why it cannot be accepted, even if all the assumptions on which this hypothesis is based are considered true.
