If you need a day off of work, pretending to be sick can be an easy way to relax at home. When you want to pretend like you have an illness, start by faking symptoms a few days before you want to take off. As you get closer to your fake sick day, act more sluggish and irritable to appear like your condition is getting worse. On the morning you want to take off, contact your boss to let them know how sick youâ€™re feeling. Just be careful not to fake sicknesses too often, or else you may get caught. It's also important to remember that pretending to be sick at work isn't a great idea if there is a serious public health crisis happening like the COVID-19 pandemic.
