        "text": "The opinions expressed in this article are the writer’s own and do not reflect the views of Her Campus.\n\nThis article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at U Conn chapter.\n\nI’m going to start with a disclaimer. I’m a bar girl through and through. Any weekend I’m at UConn, which is most, you will see me there Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I live for the weekends. Most of my excitement for them comes from the fact that I will be letting loose on the dance floor at Huskies or mingling with others at Ted’s, obviously with a Red Beaver in hand. That being said, I want to compare the bar scene to frats. While I love the bars, I want to give the frats a chance for people to see why they are just as popular.\n\nBars\n\nPros:\n\nThey’re more social than frats. I have made countless friends at the bar. From striking up random conversations at the bar with the person beside you waiting to be served to bonding with the other girls in line for the bathroom, the bar is the perfect place to meet new friends or maybe something more… also, because the UConn bar scene is so small, a chance encounter with someone one night does not necessarily mean you’ll never see them again.\n\nThe bars offers a better drinks selection. You can basically order anything there. Can you get a Bionic Beaver in a frat? No. However, you can get one in Ted’s, and at $8, it has you sorted for a large portion of your night with its potent combination of liquors.\n\nGetting to them is convenient. As I live on campus, having the luxury of being able to walk home rather than getting a ride is extremely practical. No need for the Uber app or a designated driver. They are also ideally located beside Sam’s, Sgt Pepperoni, and Wing’s Over. These restaurants will always have your fix after a boozy night with greasy food that will offset the amount of alcohol you have consumed.\n\nAs a 21-year-old, I love the bar because the crowd there is closer to my age. Obviously, there are a few who aren’t. In general, however, everyone is most likely a junior or older. I don’t want to sh*t on younger students, but having a conversation with an 18-year-old is often not the same as with someone a little older.\n\nThe bars have security. We’ve all been in fear of the Huskies or Ted’s bouncers at some point during our time at UConn, but it is reassuring to know they are there. If you are getting harassed, you have a good chance of getting helped by one of them. Had too much to drink? They’ll notice and make sure you leave and go home before things get out of control.\n\nThey’re open on weekdays and have loads of fun events. On Tuesday, there’s trivia at Ted’s or Taco Tuesday at Tav, and of course, you can’t forget about karaoke on Wednesday at Ted’s. These are perfect for unwinding after a busy day of classes!\n\nCons:\n\nThis is mainly a UConn issue, but the bar scene is quite repetitive. Since there are only three places to go out and only a portion of students go to them, you often run into the same people. While this can be considered a pro, it also has its downsides. That guy who cheated on you last weekend will most likely be there. Or, the weird Tinder match who won’t stop sending you cringy pickup lines. Or, the girl who was rude to you because you flirted with the guy she likes. Things can get messy quite quickly.\n\nIt’s expensive. While Tav is free of charge on the weekends, unlike Ted’s or Huskies, it’s the least amount of fun (in my opinion, at least). Cover at Ted’s is $5, and Huskies upped it to $7 this semester. Oh yeah, and it’s $2 to keep your jacket on the coat rack. Add to that the drinks you may have and the number of times you go out in one week; it all adds up. While most pregame hard before going out, you will most likely drunkenly buy a round of tequila shots at 1am, thinking it’s a great idea but regret it pretty soon after.\n\nFrats\n\nPros:\n\nThey’re free (unless you can’t get a sober ride). College is already expensive as it is, so getting to leave your wallet at home and not worry about paying for anything is pretty nice.\n\nThere’s no need to worry about getting denied. No matter what age you are, they will let you in. The fake ID you pray will let you into the bar is unnecessary at any frat.\n\nThey have themed nights. Dressing up for a theme can be super fun and get your creativity flowing. I attended a Euphoria-themed party earlier this semester, and it was so cool to see the effort all the girls had put into their look. It’s an opportunity to experiment with hair, makeup, and outfits in a way that you may not dare to do at the bar.\n\nCons:\n\nOrganizing a ride is a nightmare. Finding someone who can take you and your friends to the frat house at a time that isn’t too early or too late is stressful and does not always work in your favor. Having contacts is vital, but with so many frats at UConn, it isn’t likely you’ll know someone in all of them. Plus, all the houses are off-campus at UConn, meaning that walking to them, for the most part, is not an option.\n\nThe male to female ratio is very uneven. As an international student, I found it weird that guys outside of the frat are rarely allowed in. To be honest, it makes me slightly uncomfortable that they want all these girls to themselves. The greater the difference in numbers between guys and girls is, the more likely they are to get a girl than if they went to the bar.\n\nThey smell bad. You can’t tell me you have not been to a frat where it didn’t smell bad. There is nothing worse than being stuck in a crowded frat house basement in the summer heat. The stench of sweat has me instantly regretting my outfit choice and always desperate for a shower as soon as I return home.\n\nThe alcohol situation isn’t ideal. You’ll always be warned not to drink the jungle juice at frats. While some are safe alcohol-wise, not all are. You can always pregame hard or bring your own drink, but that most likely won’t be enough for some girls to tolerate the night. Also, you can’t drink whatever you want like you can at the bar.\n\nThe music is questionable. I swear every frat uses the same playlist. “Party in the USA.” Check. “Trap Queen. Check. “UCLA.” Check. “Shots.” Check. The list goes on. While I can tolerate them most of the time, the variety is non-existent compared to the bars. At Huskies, they have DJs on weekends who play different mixes. Tav has live music, and only at Ted’s will you hear “Take Me Home, Country Roads” followed up by “Pepas.”\n\nBoth bars and frats at UConn have some good and some bad. While Ted’s will forever remain my favorite place on campus, it is nice to have the alternative of attending a frat once in a while. As an international student, I loved being able to experience something so foreign to me before attending UConn. However, I will say that what you see in movies is what you get in real life. Loud music, sweaty bodies, and questionable drinks. It’s not somewhere I necessarily want to go on the regular, unlike the bars on campus, but I like that we have the choice of both."
