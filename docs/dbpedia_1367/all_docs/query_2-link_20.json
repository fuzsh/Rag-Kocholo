        "text": "An Orange County man is expected to be arraigned in federal court on an indictment charging him with defrauding victims who paid for COVID-related medical protective equipment that was never delivered, causing nearly $3 million in losses.\n\n60 year old Christopher John Badsey, who lives Lake Forest, was arrested by FBI agents on July 8 without incident. He is charged with four counts of wire fraud and two counts of money laundering. He was arraigned in United States District Court in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to an indictment returned by a federal grand jury on July 7, Badsey falsely represented that he had access to millions of boxes of medical-grade nitrile gloves through his Irvine-based company, First Defense International Security Services Corp. (FDI)\n\nThis type of personal protective equipment was in high demand and short supply during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBadsey allegedly entered into contractual agreements with victims, whom he required to provide a money deposit to inspect the gloves before delivery.\n\nAfter receiving the deposits, Badsey allegedly instructed victims to travel to the Los Angeles area, where he claimed the gloves were stored in a warehouse. But when victims attempted to visit the warehouse, Badsey and other FDI employees allegedly provided excuses as to why the gloves could neither be inspected, nor delivered, to the victims.\n\nNitrile gloves were never provided to the victims, and Badsey is alleged to have absconded with the deposit money totaling nearly $3 million. After obtaining the victims’ wire deposits, Badsey and others are believed to have used those funds to make lavish purchases for their personal benefit."
