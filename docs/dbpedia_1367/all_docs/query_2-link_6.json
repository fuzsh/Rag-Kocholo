        "text": "Imposter syndrome! This is real in IT and Helpdesk! You can never know everything in IT or about a certain software or OS or area. Working in Helpdesk, we find ourselves being a “jack or all trades” when it comes to IT. This is great, this is awesome, this allows us to help users with so many issues! But… but we are so focused on learning a little bit about so many things that we fall short on being an expert in one thing. It does however help us find our passion. Learning so many things, helps us find our “niche”, find what grabs our attention and interests. However, when asked how much you know about a certain subject, it’s hard to feel confident about our knowledge in that area. For example, I am studying Cybersecurity and am networking and reaching out to others in the field for advice and the question always is “how much do you know about X Y Z”? Well… I have studied it, came crossed it, worked with it, but can’t ever honestly answer it, cause I don’t know how much I know. I have taken some courses and past some tests, but does that make me fluent? How much experience does that give me? How much do you have to know about it to claim to have experience? If I don’t know, I know how to research and learn, but I don’t know when I should feel like I’m comfortable enough to say, “yeah I know Linux, yeah I know SQL, yeah I know networks.” How do you deal with imposter syndrome in IT? How do you feel like you are ready to take the next step into a new position or journey? #helpdesk #it #opentowork\n\nAfternoon all, it’s Harry from Sanderson G&D 💼 For those unaware, I specialise operating across the National Security sector, specifically with the eDV community. Given the sensitivity of this sector, one can find themselves a lot of the time talking in code, and I’m not talking about Java or Python 🐍 (…ba dum tss!) Things can get a little confusing when exploring options and other opportunities 😵💫 For example: - What restrictions may apply? ⛔️ - What is the market like at the moment? ⛔️ - Are there any conflicts of interest? ⛔️ Along with giving advice, my job is to understand what a great opportunity looks like for somebody. As we all know, things can change over night. Hence why you find me regularly checking in with my network 🌎 To avoid ending up like this poor girl in a world full of mazy mirrors, get in touch, sometimes we just need a helping hand 🤝 #Sanderson #Government #Defence #Nationalsecurity #securityclearance #recruitment #consultant #talentledsolution #opportunities #jobs #help #mirrors #maze #funny\n\nDay (15/146) August 23, 2023, of studying 5 hours daily for the remainder of the year. You can go to #nguyenlife to keep track of my goal and post. Benchmark: Total time studied (day): 5 hours Total time studied so far (weekly): 11 hours Total time studied so far: 72 hours Here to submit my time. Study more about smb enumeration. Next is FTP. 🖥️ Follow me, Nguyen N. , for more information on blue-team-focused cybersecurity or IT-related content. I love connecting with everyone in the field or trying to get in. Self-Advertisement: I'm looking for an entry-level cybersecurity or IT job. List of roles I'm interested in: Information Security Analyst | Cybersecurity Engineer | Information System Security Analyst | Cyber security Analyst | Security Analyst | Python Developer | Help Desk | System Administrator | IT Support Remote: US-Based | Onsite: Florida Cybersecurity Professional that inspires me every day: Eduardo Del Castillo | Josh Mason 🍄 | Sean Mitchell | Jessica Bishop 🧭\n\nI think this is somthing the companies have to decide for themselves. Where do they put their priorities, etc.. 1. You dont care that much about exeptional skills. You prefer someone fitting in a desk environment and just does what he/she needs to do and nothing more. P.S. i feel like big companies are more like this. 2. You want people that will evolve your company to new hights and stand out doing exeptional things. Potential that can grow into unseen talent. So as a company you give those people their comfort without trying to force them into something they won't stand. If option 2 should exist more frequently in real life, everyone should be able to find a fitting place instead of eventually falling into the dark side. (just a thought)\n\nHey there, everyone! 🚀 Big news from my end – I've just landed a Seasonal Tech Support job. It's my first step into the civilian tech world after proudly serving in the Navy. 🌐 What's the endgame, you ask? I'm laser-focused on making my way into the Cybersecurity field, where I'm passionate about safeguarding the digital world. 🛡️ But here's the thing, and it's an important one: Helpdesk/tech support roles, and other entry-level positions, often get a bad rap. What people might not realize is that they're the perfect place to learn the fundamentals that can lead you to more lucrative jobs in the future. So, here's the deal: I'd love to tap into your wisdom. If you've journeyed from help desk or tech support roles into the world of Cybersecurity, I'd be thrilled to hear your story in the comments below! 📚 Let's create a platform for some inspiring tales and valuable advice. Together, we can make this tech transition an epic one! 🌟 #MilitaryTransition #TechJourney #CybersecurityDreams #technology #bestadvice"
