        "text": "I went to see Roger Hale mainly because of my interest in the case that put him in jail. Hale, who is forty-seven years old, black, and a total stranger to all forms of American privilege, is serving twelve years in a federal prison in Louisiana after pleading guilty to distributing cocaine. He was born and raised in San Augustine County, in the piney-woods country known as Deep East Texas. I was spending a lot of time in San Augustine, and that was another reason I went to see him: he was related to a lot of people I got to know. His wife, for instance, a soft-voiced young woman known as Fanny, waitresses at the Hill Top Barbecue, a family-run joint where I often ate lunch. When Fanny heard that I was going to visit her husband, she sent the same message that one of his cousins did: “Just tell Roger we love him.”\n\nThe case was known as Operation White Tornado. It had been a combined effort by federal, state, and local law-enforcement officers to shut down a cocaine-trafficking network based in San Augustine County. Some two hundred agents had descended on San Augustine on June 2, 1989, and arrested dozens of residents, including Hale. A crowd gathered in the courthouse square in the town of San Augustine that night and cheered as handcuffed suspects were led into the squat old jail. At a press conference the next day, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas announced that the local drug trade had been “what you would expect to find in a major metropolitan area.” Seventy-five pounds of cocaine—with a street value of more than three million dollars—had been moving through San Augustine each week, he said.\n\nThis was startling news, if only because San Augustine is, even by East Texas standards, poor, isolated, and sparsely populated. The county, which is half the size of Rhode Island, has only eight thousand inhabitants, thirty-five per cent of whom live below the federal poverty line. Though it is on no interstate highway, and is about eighty miles from a town of any size, San Augustine had somehow become, according to the authorities, a major regional distribution center for cocaine. I wanted to know how that had happened, and also how such a small, close-knit community had absorbed the impact of an Operation White Tornado. (Some people called it Operation Black Tornado, for of fifty-four people ultimately convicted on various charges fifty were black. San Augustine County is thirty per cent black.) Clearly, some combination of drugs and the national “war on drugs” had rocked the county to its foundations.\n\nRoger Hale, according to the police, was actually a minor figure in the San Augustine drug trade. But when we met, in an empty prison visiting room, he came on like a tough guy. In a harsh, level voice, he told extravagant stories of wheeling and dealing in guns and jewelry—but not drugs—and made extravagant threats against people in San Augustine who he felt had sold him down the river. His standard pronouncement on his enemies was “He’s no earthly good, and he knows I know it.” He himself had never really done anything wrong—“just devilment,” he said—but he had become unpopular as a result of his work as a repo man (work that had required him to carry a sawed-off shotgun) and his involvement in what he called “politics.” Hale’s social philosophy might also have hurt his popularity, I thought. “People who had less than me, I never messed with ’em, because I couldn’t make nothing off ’em,” he said. “I never had much time for black people. I mostly associated with up-to-date white people.”\n\nHale believed that he was in prison solely because of his association with Nathan Tindall, a not especially up-to-date white person who had been the sheriff of San Augustine County for the better part of forty years. Hale had worked, in various capacities, for Mr. Nathan, as he called him, his entire adult life. Indeed, people in San Augustine still described Hale as “Nathan’s hey-boy,” a nasty little tag that Hale may have had in mind when he informed me vehemently, “I’m my own man. I ain’t no boy.”\n\nNathan Tindall was, according to many accounts, the chief target of Operation White Tornado. He had left the sheriff’s office just a few months before the raid, after losing the last election, and federal indictments had fallen all around him. Roger Hale went to prison on drug charges, and so did Hale’s two grown sons. Willie Earl Dade, Tindall’s last chief deputy, was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Dave Husband, a local liquor wholesaler and a longtime friend and political ally of Tindall’s, was one of the white defendants in the case. Roger Hale said, “Me and the white boy, we got the hard time just because we wouldn’t give them the Sheriff.” By “the white boy” he meant Husband, and in Husband’s case he was certainly right. Although Husband had coöperated by pleading guilty to drug, gun, and tax charges—and no drugs had been found on his property, and he had no prior felony convictions, and none of the crimes he was charged with involved any violence—he had, after refusing to incriminate Tindall, been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. This extraordinary sentence was one of the things that particularly interested me about Operation White Tornado. I also wondered, naturally, how it was that Tindall had escaped indictment.\n\nHale didn’t really tell me much on that score. He could have tried to incriminate Tindall to curry favor with the feds, of course. “But I didn’t want to be that kind of fella,” he said. He did know some explosive things, he insisted. “And I’m about ready to call somebody, bring down that whole town like the Titanic.” But he apparently wasn’t ready to sink any ships through me.\n\nListening to Hale, trying to sort out the possibly true from the wildly improbable, I found myself wondering what kind of fella he in fact was. His peculiar fury, his stiff-necked hustler’s dignity (which made it impossible to relay the simple news from home: that his family loved him) struck me as the likely product of a dismal mismatch—a bitter gap between his ambitions and his lot. I remembered his cousin, a beautiful church-choir singer and school-bus driver, with dark skin, narrow eyes, and strongly planed features that were just like Hale’s, saying, “Roger got the brains, he just don’t have the—mm, background.” And Hale, even from the depths of his crushing prison sentence, kept returning, I noticed, to the prospects and requirements of various business enterprises—trucking companies, gaming rooms—and discussed them with great energy. Some huge percentage of black men in Deep East Texas struggle to make a living “hauling pulpwood” (a dangerous, low-overhead form of logging), and Hale himself had worked for many years in the woods. But his heart, I suspected, was in the office, the bank, the auto dealership. When I asked about the drug raid’s community impact, he fairly snarled, “Operation White Tornado just put every black man with any business talent in San Augustine in prison.”\n\nEast Texas resembles the Deep South far more than it does the open prairies of the rest of Texas. Dense pine and hardwood forests shroud rolling terrain; lakes and bayous are fed by fifty inches of rain a year. San Augustine was first settled by white farmers and their black slaves migrating west at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Their cotton plantations thrived in the red lands that run in a wide, fertile band across the county. The town, laid out in 1832, is, in the words of a road sign today, “The Oldest Anglo Town in Texas.” Several of the leaders of the Texas Republic came from San Augustine; Sam Houston himself lived there in the eighteen-thirties.\n\nWhite San Augustine, like much of the white South, never recovered from the Civil War. There were, in fact, more people living in the county in 1900 than there are today. As a result, San Augustine teems with ghosts, particularly in the woods, where innumerable small family graveyards lie overgrown. The slavery era left an indelible print on the county: surprising numbers of people, black and white, share the same few family names. These biracial clans were created when former slaves took the names of their owners after emancipation, causing those cruel original re-lationships to echo down through the ages.\n\nLike the rest of the “black belt” of the rural South (places with populations at least thirty per cent black), San Augustine after the Civil War settled into a general poverty, endured by all but a small élite. Sharecropping, which lasted nearly a century, perpetuated the old master-servant relations between certain black and white families, and Jim Crow laws and the Ku Klux Klan helped maintain social and economic distinctions between black and white small farmers. The great tide of American industrial prosperity bypassed the region as a whole. Timber eventually replaced cotton—wood remains the county’s leading crop—and poultry farming came along after the Second World War, but the big timber mills and chicken-processing plants were all built elsewhere. There are poorer counties in East Texas, but San Augustine is today a backwater even in a backward, isolated area.\n\nMost Texans simply disown the whole region. “Behind the Pine Curtain” is what they call East Texas. Why, the people there aren’t really even Texans, I was once told in Houston; they’re the ones who were afraid to come out of the woods and into the sunlight during the great westward movement.\n\nAnd much about San Augustine does feel frozen in time, preserved from another era. Not only the plantation houses—slave-built from virgin longleaf pine—but many of the older houses in town have the wide porches and twelve-light windows, the fluted Doric columns and classical pediments of the antebellum South. On the courthouse square, farmers sell watermelons, okra, potatoes, and yellow squash from pickups parked next to the jail. Bags of seed are piled on a canopied sidewalk in front of an old brick hardware store. The only stoplight in town—and San Augustine is the only real town in the county—blinks sleepily, often seeing no traffic, at one corner of the square. Across the railroad tracks, in a black neighborhood still known as the Quarters, unpainted shotgun shacks lean under tall pines and great, spreading maples. On the porches in the Quarters, old folks nod in weathered armchairs; in the back yards, roosters crow from woodpiles. The atmosphere of deep, premodern slumber is broken only by the passing of a glistening violet Nissan miniature pickup, its side windows smoked, its chassis lowered almost to the ground, with a gold-flaked stiff chain around the license plate, a young black man at the wheel, and percussive hip-hop pounding from the cab.\n\nThough a big stone courthouse sits at the center of the square that occupies the center of downtown San Augustine, the old two-story brick jailhouse next door takes up far more symbolic space in the county’s collective consciousness. People talk about “the sheriff”—or “the high sheriff”—whose office is in the jailhouse, as though he were an intimate, fundamental, inescapable fact of life, like oxygen or aging or family. They dream about him, turn to him in every sort of extremity, blame him for every sort of distress. More than once, I overheard residents in their cups declaring that their lives would be utterly different if only So-and-So were sheriff. The sheriff is held accountable not just for law enforcement but for the community’s moral and economic health. He sets a tone, he defines an era. Presidents are marginal figures by comparison.\n\nPolitically, the South became a one-party state after Reconstruction, and in the system of power and patronage that emerged in virtually all rural areas violence was never far from the surface. In the eighteen-nineties, the Populists briefly challenged the ruling Democrats, and in San Augustine they managed to capture the sheriff’s office. The first Populist sheriff of San Augustine was gunned down in the street in 1900 by a political rival. A few weeks later, his successor, who also happened to be his nephew, was shot, and two other nephews were killed, in a downtown shootout with leading Democrats. This particular political feud, which was also a clan feud, led to a number of other deaths. Soon, though, the Democrats were back in control of the county, and they have not been seriously challenged since.\n\nThe saloons where much of this frontier-style violence found its spark were closed by Prohibition, which came to Texas in 1918. But the illegal-liquor business thrived in perennially depressed, lightly policed San Augustine, and this trade, too, gave rise to frequent violent disputes. Like most Bible Belt communities, the county stayed dry after the repeal of national Prohibition, and thus insured that moonshining and bootlegging would continue. The families who controlled the liquor trade began to terrorize their neighbors, going on a legendary binge of robbery, rape, assault, and murder, until finally, in 1935, the Texas Rangers were sent in. The state officers took control of local law enforcement, forcing out the sheriff and bringing the outlaw clans to justice. Four thousand people gathered on the courthouse square to thank the Rangers. Still, moonshining and bootlegging remained important local industries in an economy that otherwise, during the Depression, virtually came to a halt.\n\nNathan Tindall grew up in Depression San Augustine. His parents were poor tenant farmers on the Attoyac River, in the western part of the county. He went to school in a lumber-company settlement and rarely saw the town of San Augustine. His family belonged to either Pentecostal or Baptist country churches; they and their neighbors moved in a separate social universe from the Episcopalians and the Methodists who worshipped in the big white churches in town. As a teen-ager, Tindall became a mule skinner—an independent logger with a mule team—and earned a name for himself as a hard worker blessed with extraordinary strength. “For a white man, Nathan was almighty stout,” a veterinarian named Tom Blount told me. “He could pick up a hundred-and-twenty-eight-pound sack of oats with his teeth and throw it up on the back of a truck.”\n\nIn 1943, at the age of eighteen, Tindall joined the Navy. He served in the Pacific, as a military policeman, and was wounded near Kwajalein. When he came home to San Augustine after the war, one of the first things he did was run for sheriff. It was an unusual move for a twenty-one-year-old, but Tindall was an unusual twenty-one-year-old. “Hell, I was just as settled at twenty-one as I am now,” the sixty-nine-year-old Tindall told me. “I grew up young, for some reason, and never did change.”\n\n“Nathan was strangely even-tempered,” Dr. Blount recalled. “Almost unnaturally so. Also, there wasn’t a scared bone in him.”\n\nGreatly aided by the general popularity of returning soldiers, he was elected. A photograph of the young sheriff, taken in 1950, shows a smooth-cheeked, round-faced, blue-eyed country boy in a tall white Stetson. He looks kindly and calm, almost shy. Studying the photograph, Tindall—now portly, gray-haired, nearsighted, and nothing like shy—remarked to me thoughtfully, “I don’t believe I’d vote for a kid that young.”\n\nHis new job paid only forty-five hundred dollars a year, but with it came a late-model, cream-colored Ford with a red light mounted in the center of the grille, and Tindall soon found that sheriffing suited him down to the ground. He knew the woods, where most of the county’s moonshining and bootlegging went on, and he was willing to go to considerable lengths to do his job. “One time, I knew this old boy down there in Black Ankle was makin’ whiskey,” he recalled. “But I just didn’t know where, and one day I seen he had a jenny, and I knew she was for carryin’ the corn into the woods, because makin’ that whiskey takes a lot of corn. So I seen he wasn’t around, and I let the jenny out of her pen, and she took off into the woods. And I just grabbed onto her tail and followed her through the woods for about five miles. Finally, we came up to where the old boy had his rig, and he looked up, but he just saw the jenny, because I was down low right behind her. And when we got there and I popped up he went crazy. Cryin’, prayin’, screamin’. Wanted to kill hisself, wanted to kill that poor old jenny. But she didn’t do nothin’ wrong. Boy just didn’t want to go to jail.”\n\nTindall didn’t attempt the impossible—shutting down the illegal-liquor trade. He simply kept enough pressure on the bootleggers and moonshiners to insure that their power didn’t get out of hand, and kept the county’s bank account filled with the fines he collected from them. The bootleggers’ lawyers, notably Smith Ramsey and his brother Ben, were formidable opponents. The Ramseys were members of the old, landed élite of San Augustine—Ben served as lieutenant governor of Texas in the fifties, and Smith was routinely described as the most powerful man in town. Tindall, who never did win the support of most of the San Augustine Old Guard, had to work around them. “One time, I waited till Smith was on vacation and Ben was busy in Austin,” he recalled. “And then I rounded up twenty-eight bootleggers, and I persuaded that judge, who usually did whatever Smith told him to do, to hit those boys with the maximum fine, a thousand dollars each. I could run the sheriff’s office for five years in them days on twenty-eight thousand dollars.”\n\nAlthough Tindall’s annual budget was minuscule, he took pride in leaving most of it unspent. He was loath to renovate the jailhouse, which badly needed work, and he went to great lengths to process prisoners swiftly, so that the county wouldn’t have to feed them. “We had county court on Monday afternoons,” Carol Vaughn, the county treasurer, told me. “So if Nathan arrested somebody on a Monday evening, he’d just arraign them any way he could. Anything to avoid holding them for a week. He’d let them go and tell them to come back Monday, or else call the judge, get the person’s attorney, if they had one, down there, and do it right in the sheriff’s office.”\n\nTindall even found a way to make money off his jailhouse—by taking overflow prisoners from crowded urban jails in Beaumont and Houston. One winter, the big-city inmates protested their primitive lodgings by tearing up their cells, and so Tindall housed them outdoors, cuffed to a flagpole on the courthouse square (it was sleeting, he recalled), while the cells were slowly cleaned.\n\n“Nathan was very penny-pinching,” Charles Mitchell, the San Augustine district attorney, said. “And it could cause problems. Once, he tried to save the county money by not having an autopsy in a triple murder. He figured that it was self-enclosed—that the killer was one of the dead people—and I’m sure he was right. But what if some kids come in later and say there was a shooter in a tree?” Tindall’s official parsimony also gave rise to some strange personal habits. “He always wrote a ‘T’ on the plastic-foam cup he used for coffee,” Mitchell said. “And he’d use the same cup for five days.”\n\nBut when it came to solving crimes Tindall’s approach was, according to him and to others as well, tenacious and inventive. “I’d do about anything to catch a thug,” he told me. “I remember, once, this old boy had murdered his mother-in-law, and I knew how these boys always like to talk about what they done, so I saw them all in there one night, and I crawled up under the house, where I could hear them clear as could be. And here was this old boy tellin’ them others, ‘Don’t tell the sheriff this, and don’t tell the sheriff that.’ After a few minutes, I heard pretty much everything I needed to know.”\n\nCharles Mitchell, who happens to be Smith Ramsey’s nephew, grew up in San Augustine in the nineteen-sixties. “You couldn’t do a thing here without the Sheriff knowing about it,” Mitchell told me. “He just pretty well handled it. One thing you have to say for Nathan: he is good at solving crimes.”\n\nGary Borders, who edited a newspaper in San Augustine for five years in the nineteen-eighties, recalled, “Tindall’s judgments were very hard to second-guess. They were, you could say, uncannily canny.”\n\nTindall’s wits were his main weapon, literally. In a county where virtually everyone seems to carry a gun—where grandmothers pat their aprons significantly when the subject is small pistols and self-defense, where people still hunt deer and squirrel and possum for meat irrespective of the season, and where I was regarded with disbelief and disdain by local young women after admitting that I travelled unarmed—Tindall never carried a gun.\n\n“He’s a six-gun sheriff without the six-gun,” said Sam Malone, a local printer and longtime East Texas newspaperman.\n\n“He was always such a disappointment to me and the kids,” I was told by Nathan’s wife, Willie Earl Tindall, who is a schoolteacher and local historian. “He didn’t wear a gun, and you know how he made an arrest? He’d call them on the telephone and tell them to meet him at the jailhouse.”\n\nTindall even made murder arrests over the telephone—perhaps fifty of them, he reckons, through the years. But his best-known exploits tended to feature his strangely even temper. I talked to several survivors of a standoff with a local man who killed his girlfriend and then barricaded himself inside a house, from which he shot a sheriff, a deputy sheriff, an ambulance driver, and a highway patrolman—the sheriff and the deputy each lost an eye—before Tindall showed up and, unarmed, strode up to the house. “This is Tindall,” he is reported to have said. “Come on out of there.” The man came out and laid his shotgun on the porch, and Tindall took him to jail.\n\nTindall’s peculiar authority is difficult to account for, according to Sam Malone. “He tells you to do something, you just better do it. Not because he’ll hurt you physically, or even throw you in jail. He’s just a queer nut. There ain’t no explaining him.”\n\nOccasionally, some drunk or foolish miscreant did compel Tindall to use force. “He had a famously effective knockout punch,” Gary Borders said. “But he used it sparingly. And, as far as I could see, he did it without any relish. Tindall never used more force than was necessary to take a suspect into custody, and he used to brag that he never charged anyone with resisting arrest.”\n\nTindall, being a politician, loved to get his picture in the paper. “Nathan was always showing off,” Borders went on to say. “He once called me up to go out with him. He had solved the Case of the Stolen High School Band Instruments. We went out there, and the band instruments were right where he said they would be. He went on and on about his own brilliance, as if he had just solved the crime of the century. Finally, I managed to ask how he had come to suspect the boy who did it. The boy’s mother had called him up, Nathan said, and told him that her son stole the stuff.”\n\nIn truth, solving crimes and making arrests are not the major part of a rural sheriff’s job. “Mainly, the sheriff in a county like San Augustine has to know the people, and how to get their problems solved,” a state-police sergeant told me. “If two guys got a beef, he might just throw them both in a cell and let ’em fight it out. Or maybe run one guy out of the county.” Character judgments, in other words, count for at least as much as crime judgments. As an example of Tindall’s non-crime judgment, Charles Mitchell recalled a case in which the young son of a local drug addict won a twelve-thousand-dollar settlement after a car accident. Tindall gently suggested that the money be put in a trust, and, to everyone’s astonishment, the addict mother agreed to that arrangement.\n\nIn the end, the rural sheriff, for all his autonomy and local power, is in a service profession, and the parameters of his job description have a tendency to expand indefinitely. “In San Augustine, if you’re out of water, the sheriff’s supposed to bring you water,” Willie Earl Tindall said. “If your car breaks down, the sheriff’s supposed to carry you home. If your lights go out, and you can’t get the electric company, it’s the sheriff’s job to bring you a flashlight. It’s pathetic, but that’s the way people think here.”\n\nTindall took this “political” side of his job so seriously that he essentially put himself on twenty-four-hour call for forty years. His nights off were so short that he often slept in his office. He and Willie Earl were married in the jailhouse, with two deputies as witnesses and with Nathan wearing his uniform.\n\nTindall had one major interest besides sheriffing, and that was making money. He started out by providing logging equipment to other men, and soon became what is called a pulpwood contractor. He bought and sold stands of timber, and acquired a fleet of logging trucks, a truck dealership, and, finally, a small sawmill. He also became a land trader. By the nineteen-seventies, Tindall’s businesses were grossing more than two million dollars a year. Many of his employees were ex-residents of his jailhouse. Tindall’s standard response to a jobless man who asked for work included providing him with a chain saw, a bobtail truck, and directions to some obscure patch of woods.\n\nHis recordkeeping was loose at best—he never employed a foreman, let alone a bookkeeper—and his lending policies were liberal, with the result that half of San Augustine eventually owed him money. The areas of overlap between his businesses and his work as sheriff, and the potential for conflicts of interest, were endless, and local muttering about corruption and the exploitation of public office grew louder with the years. Tindall, naturally, denies the charges that he grew light-fingered in office. And he was reëlected again and again.\n\nHis generosity helped. Tindall himself reckons that he “gave away” a million dollars while he was sheriff. “Hell, I paid for over fifty babies to be born,” he told me. “Everybody, black or white, knew that if a baby was coming and there was no money you just had to call the high sheriff.”\n\n“The sheriff’s office used to look like a bank,” Gary Borders recalled. “People actually stood in line to borrow money from Nathan. Some paid him back, but my impression was that most never did.”\n\nThe Reverend Cecil Clark, a leader of the local black community, who has done his share of truck driving and pulpwood hauling for Tindall, told me that he would have lost his family’s house if Tindall had not stepped in and made the mortgage payments during a bad patch in the seventies. An old black man named Willie Harp, who lives in a shack off a dirt road in the northwestern part of the county, said that the only reason one of his daughters was able to leave San Augustine, attend college, and climb out of poverty was that Mr. Nathan had paid for her education.\n\nTindall’s warm relations with his black constituents irritated some whites, who took to calling him “the nigger sheriff.” Particularly offensive in the eyes of such whites was his habit of shaking hands with black friends in public. Although he was not above enforcing the segregation of Jim Crow days, Tindall’s support in black San Augustine was deep and wide. He was seen as the rare powerful white man who treated the races more or less equally—“I was just treatin’ the blacks the way they make you treat ’em now,” he told me—and as the rare sheriff who tempered law enforcement with leniency. “Tindall wasn’t no big crusadin’, whip-snappin’ sheriff,” Sam Malone recalled. “He was a practical man livin’ with poor, practical people.” If a prisoner in Tindall’s jail had a job and a family, the sheriff usually let him out in the mornings, so that he could go to work, and locked him up again in the evenings. Tindall cultivated his support in the black community by holding free barbecues and, at election time, by “hauling votes”—providing free transportation to the polls, courtesy of operatives like Roger Hale. The black vote, which routinely went more than eighty per cent for Tindall, became the key to his electoral lock, particularly after the civil-rights period and the increase it generated in black-voter registration.\n\nThe civil-rights movement had relatively little impact on San Augustine, however. White resistance was deep: public schools were segregated until 1970, and even then integration occurred only under federal court order. “Even for the South, this town is not what you would call advanced,” Leroy Hughes, the principal of San Augustine High School, told me. Hughes, who is black, grew up in Jackson, Mississippi. “San Augustine is about where Jackson was twenty years ago,” he said. The town is more than fifty per cent black—and the schools are nearly sixty per cent black—yet the leading local service organizations, the Lions and the Rotary Club, are still exclusively white.\n\nThat the tightwad sheriff was also a one-man charitable foundation was a paradox lost on nobody in San Augustine, least of all Willie Earl Tindall. Yet she claims that, although she knew of her husband’s legendary generosity, she never realized how much money his businesses were making until she started reading about it in the press. “If I’d known that—are you kidding? I would’ve had my butt in a Cadillac the next minute.” But Nathan, the work-focussed child of the Depression, never changed his ways to reflect his wealth—he never went on vacation or wore anything but his sheriff’s uniform—and by the time Willie Earl realized they were millionaires they weren’t.\n\nThat is, Tindall’s business fortunes, along with the Texas economy as a whole, turned down sharply in the nineteen-eighties—particularly, in his case, after he bought the San Augustine Sawmill in an effort to keep it from being closed. “He saw himself as the savior of the county,” Gary Borders recalled. “And it just about wiped him out.” Tindall lost the mill, and then a deep recession in the wood business and a disastrous investment in a floundering local bank plunged him close to bankruptcy.\n\nThe strange thing about Tindall’s fall from financial grace, according to those who were there, was that it hardly seemed to affect him. He just kept sheriffing night and day, and claimed not to miss the money. His self-confidence, they said, seemed entirely undiminished.\n\nAnd such unflappability was actually not hard to picture, I found, for by the time I met Tindall he was selling used cars on U.S. 96, having been turned out of office by the voters, drubbed fearfully in the press, and hounded for years on end by various federal investigators; yet “humbled” was still about the last word that would have come to mind to describe him. He bustled around the car lot, popping hoods and turning ignitions for a succession of solemn young car shoppers, shouting instructions to a stream of “hey-boys,” black and white, who wheeled up in work-batter pickups or crawled out from under jacked, delaminating Buicks. He took me into his office, a grubby box at one end of a sagging mobile home, where, between telephone calls full of business dickering (“A million feet a month, I’d go five dollars a ton first year, six dollars second year, up to nine dollars fifth year”), he bragged for two hours about all the timber he had cut and all the crooks he had caught, and shook his head sadly over the performance of his successor. “He knows about as much about sheriffin’ as he does about jet airplanes,” Tindall said.\n\nThe peculiar authority that Sam Malone noted in Tindall does not arise from his physical presentation. Tindall’s boots that day were muddy, his shirt was rumpled, and he wore ill-fitting brown jeans with an oil rag hanging from a front pocket and a pair of rubber-handled pliers protruding from a back pocket. One lens of his glasses, which were thick and steel-rimmed, was severely smudged—from a recent encounter with battery acid, he said. His speech was by turns fumbling, gusty, intense, distracted, and enthusiastic. It was frequently punctuated by laughter. When Tindall saw that some of his humor went right past me, he looked at me quizzically, then seemed to decide that it would all take too long to explain to a Yankee. And when a heavy-browed young black man in coveralls came in, saw that I was taking notes, and started questioning me, Tindall just grinned and let him interrupt.\n\n“People call me Frog,” the young man said eagerly.\n\n“I put him in jail for dope,” Tindall said.\n\nFrog’s eagerness to talk to a journalist vanished. He said it was true, and went about his business.\n\nFrog, I noticed, had addressed Tindall as “Cap’n,” and the title somehow sat comfortably between them.\n\nOver the weeks that followed, I often saw Tindall driving somewhere in the company of Frog and some of his equivalents—four or five of them crammed into the cab of a truck, off to cut some timber or pull another truck out of the mud. And the more time I spent in San Augustine—a place where black residents maintain that there are white shop assistants who still won’t hand them change directly—the more I came to see how unusual Tindall’s common touch truly was. I once watched him and Frog having lunch together at the Hill Top Barbecue. They teased each other cursorily while they waited for their food; then both plunged into plates of barbecued ribs, eating silently, side by side, and hardly looking up except to nod to friends and neighbors as they came through the door. I mentioned to my own lunch companion—Ilester Porter, a furniture restorer, who owns the Hill Top—that Tindall certainly seemed to be a democratic sort. “Thank you,” Porter said. “He’s too democratic.”\n\nI later asked Porter what he meant. Porter, a middle-aged black man who was decidedly not a Tindall supporter, tried to explain. “The sheriff in a place like San Augustine has one real job,” he said. “That’s to keep the poor man, black or white, poor, and let the rich man get richer. If a poor man gets into something that lets him stack up a few thousand dollars, the sheriff’s got to find some reason to bust him, take away that money by a fine. And he’s gotta leave the rich man alone, let him do what he wants. Nathan Tindall didn’t do part of his job. He didn’t care who got rich, long as he was making money himself. He let white trash like Dave Husband get rich. That’s why the rich folk decided to get rid of him, finally. And once them people over on the other side of the tracks decide you’re out, you’re out.”\n\nIn a rare local civil-rights triumph, electoral district boundaries were redrawn in San Augustine in the nineteen-seventies to create a black-majority county precinct. This redistricting led to the repeal, in 1972, of Prohibition in the new precinct. And with that repeal Nathan Tindall’s job got instantly easier, for bootlegging disappeared overnight.\n\nSince most of San Augustine’s bootleggers were black men and women, the legalization of liquor sales shut down a traditional, if déclassé, avenue of black economic opportunity. There were also white bootleggers, however, among whom Dave Husband was easily the best known. His father and his grandfather had been bootleggers before him, operating from their homestead, on the Attoyac River, so Husband had been in the business since he was a boy. By all accounts, he was a savvy trader. With legalization, he quickly opened a liquor store at the intersection of U.S. 96 and State Highway 21, just west of town.\n\nHusband’s liquor store prospered, and by the early nineteen-eighties he was a major regional wholesaler and a wealthy man. He became something of a community burgher, known for his generous disbursements to youth groups such as the 4-H Club. But he apparently never lost his outlaw predilections. A compulsive gambler, he took to wearing expensive jewelry and Rolex watches, and liked to brag about the time that Governor Edwin Edwards, of Louisiana, sent a helicopter to fetch him for a gambling date. Husband wasn’t just a high roller, though. “He’d flip quarters in the alley all day” with poor black men, according to Sam Malone. He also dabbled in all sorts of low-level rackets. “Dave was always selling a box of nails at half price,” John Mitchell, a local district judge, recalled. With the money he didn’t lose gambling, Husband built onto his house, and by the mid-eighties the old homestead on the Attoyac, where Dave still lived, now with his wife and two teen-age children, looked like the suburban spread of a partner in a Dallas law firm.\n\nAlthough Tindall had arrested Husband for bootlegging any number of times, the two men were friends. Tindall today disputes stories that they were extremely close, but after Husband’s father died, in 1961, when Dave was sixteen, Tindall, in his role as all-purpose protector of the county, did look out for the family in ways that the Husbands never forgot. Certainly Dave, once he got established as a legitimate businessman, became a prominent backer of Tindall’s, sponsoring campaign barbecues for him on the courthouse square. And the two men were firmly paired, in the eyes of the Old Guard, as upstart poor boys from Pentecostal families down on the Attoyac.\n\nHusband was actually on unusually friendly terms with law enforcement in general. He supplied free liquor to the parties and reunions of various agencies, and took Texas Rangers, highway patrolmen, sheriff’s deputies, park rangers, San Augustine’s town policemen, and just about anybody else in uniform off on hunting weekends. (Tindall, a lifelong teetotaller and a non-hunter, may have been the only lawman in Deep East Texas who missed out on those stag weekends.)\n\nCampaign barbecues notwithstanding, Tindall’s friendship with Husband probably hurt him politically more than it helped him. Tindall’s association in the public mind with a motley crowd of jailhouse hangers-on—some of them ex-inmates, all of them the sort of men who hope that a cop’s power will rub off on them—definitely hurt him politically. But Tindall, who was never particular about appearances, shrugged it off. “I never had a preacher come to me with no information,” he told me. “It’s the thieves that come to you with something, after they done got themselves into something. That’s the ones that tell you what you need to know.”\n\nAnd for many years he could, it was clear, absorb the damage. He did lose one election in the nineteen-fifties, and he once resigned as sheriff for a term in the seventies. Demographics began to work against him, too, after the state dammed the Angelina River, which forms the county’s southern border, in 1964. The dam created Sam Rayburn Reservoir, a fisherman’s paradise extending over two hundred square miles, whose wooded shores soon sprouted second homes, trailer parks, retirement communities, and other attractions for white strangers with scant interest in the affairs of the sleepy, self-absorbed little town of San Augustine, twenty-five miles away, and with no electoral loyalty to the backwoods boss whom local whites called “the nigger sheriff.” Still, Tindall’s political base was so solid, his popularity as a dispute settler and old-time paterfamilias so great, that he was all but invincible politically, his everyday power in the county—especially after the Ramseys passed from the scene—seemingly absolute.\n\n“It was just lucky for San Augustine that Nathan is a good man,” Willie Earl Tindall said. “Because he pretty much made up the law himself, whatever he thought was fair. Fortunately, most of what he thought was fair was fair.” While Mrs. Tindall could be expected to judge her husband’s performance charitably, it was generally acknowledged that he enjoyed a rare freedom—very rare for a sheriff in East Texas—from charges that he abused those who tried his patience.\n\nBut Tindall wasn’t the only San Augustine official making up the law as he went along. According to Mark McDaniel, an itinerant lawman who joined the town police force in 1986, nobody in San Augustine followed the rules. “I had worked all over Texas, and I’d never seen anything like it,” McDaniel told me. “We’d arrest somebody, and sometimes there’d be no paperwork at all. It was strange. They had never even run a search warrant. When I wanted to go to a J.P. with a probable cause, they said, ‘We don’t do that here.’ It wasn’t just Tindall. It was everybody. And I got to be the same way, six months after I started.” Though Tindall didn’t have formal jurisdiction over the town police, he had effective command, according to McDaniel. The town policemen all took their cues from Tindall, and sometimes they got them wrong. McDaniel once arrested (for reckless driving) one of the ruffians who hung around the jailhouse. His fellow-officers told him that he had unwittingly arrested a Tindall crony, who enjoyed the sheriff’s protection. But Tindall then held the suspect without bail for a week or two. “They had it dead wrong,” McDaniel said. “There was no protection.”\n\nMcDaniel also heard the rumors about Tindall being corrupt. “People would say that Tindall could make sure that a D.W.I. never went on your record,” he said. “That’s ridiculous. The sheriff of San Augustine, Texas, has no say about what does or doesn’t go on your record in Austin. But people here don’t understand that. They’re just so used to thinking that the high sheriff is all-powerful.”\n\nA lesser but similar awe surrounded other peace officers in San Augustine. “People here are just obsessed with law enforcement,” McDaniel said. “Many of them don’t have much of a life, I guess. Most places, nobody really notices who the cops are. Here, I hadn’t been on the job a month and I had an invitation to dinner at someone’s house every night of the week. You’re a little celebrity.” In such a climate, petty corruption was rampant, according to McDaniel. “We never bought beer or whiskey,” he said. “We never paid for the food at our cookouts. You know, when you’re making eleven hundred dollars a month you’re always ready for a free six-pack. And our biggest buddy—nobody likes to admit this now—was Dave Husband. Every night, we’d meet over at his store—the highway patrol and everybody—and drink Cokes, eat chips, whole-head cheese, whatever we wanted.”\n\nLong after Nathan Tindall left the sheriff’s office, some people were, I found, still muttering that he had been corrupt, and not merely on a petty, complimentary-six-pack scale. But in virtually every case these people refused to be specific, at least with me, in their allegations. And an informal survey of some of those who worked with Tindall when he was sheriff—two county judges, the county treasurer, the district attorney, the county attorney, the town attorney, the town police chief, various deputies, the only two real newspapermen in town—yielded no one who credited the charges that he was corrupt.\n\nThere was a crucial change in the mixture of law enforcement in San Augustine after bootlegging was rendered obsolete. Marijuana farmers, whose crop thrived in the fertile forests of East Texas, effectively replaced moonshiners in the local underground economy, and marijuana traffickers replaced bootleggers. And, while Nathan Tindall had little trouble keeping track of local people who got involved in marijuana—some were farmers who had fallen on hard times, and others were ex-bootleggers looking for a new trade, or underemployed loggers looking to turn a remote clear-cut into a gold mine—he sometimes found that he needed help when the scale of growing or dealing was larger, was regional rather than local. Though it was a point of pride with him to call for outside help as seldom as possible, he did occasionally call on the state police, with whom he had always been on good terms. Marvin McLeroy, a senior detective in the state narcotics office in Lufkin, recalled taking some of his men to stake out a large field of marijuana that Tindall, who didn’t have the manpower to watch it, had found deep in the woods in San Augustine County. The growers got spooked and escaped, but the state police tore out sixty thousand plants.\n\n“Of course, working in San Augustine was always a unique experience,” McLeroy told me. “Because if it wasn’t cleared with Nathan it didn’t happen. I could drive through the county, not even stop for a cup of coffee, and when I got back to my office the phone would ring and it would be Tindall wanting to know what I was doing. The man had resources.”\n\nRicky Allen, another state narcotics officer, said, “I went over there to San Augustine once to bust a dealer named Bo Barnes. Nathan asked me, ‘What’s he got?’ I told him something like five pounds of pot. Nathan wanted to just phone the old boy and tell him to get on down to the jailhouse with the dope. I told him I didn’t want to do that. I wanted to go out there with a search warrant. Nathan said, ‘A search warrant?’ Finally, we just drove out to Bo’s trailer, and Nathan hollered for him to come on out, and he did. Then Nathan told him to go back in and get all his dope and cash. And Bo did it. He brung out four or five pounds of pot and twenty-three hundred dollars. We arrested him, but Bo kept saying it was all a mistake. See, he had been dealing coke, and Nathan had told him to stop, so Bo figured that meant it was O.K. to go back to selling pot, because the Captain didn’t tell him he couldn’t.”\n\nFederal agencies were not among Tindall’s resources. He had worked with the F.B.I. when it was chasing draft evaders during the Vietnam era, and he claims to have always had cordial dealings with the feds. But his deep reluctance to invite them into San Augustine was well known, both locally and in the federal offices in Beaumont and elsewhere. Charles Ruth, a former federal magistrate in Beaumont, said, “Tindall didn’t think he needed the F.B.I., and the F.B.I. is trained to be egomaniacs, so there was a problem.” Marvin McLeroy said, “Nathan and San Augustine have been a thorn in the side of the feds for a long time.” Thus, when the federal government—not just the F.B.I. but the Drug Enforcement Administration, various task forces, and every ambitious federal prosecutor in America—got more interested in the drug trade, as part of the ever-escalating war on drugs of the mid-eighties, Tindall was not necessarily aware of the fact.\n\nAround the same time, cocaine began to replace marijuana as the main commodity in the East Texas drug trade. Cocaine moved much faster than pot, in every sense. It cost more, yielded a higher profit, involved much higher levels of the criminal world, was far harder to interdict, and, in the form of crack—the cheap, smokable version of the drug, which soon caught on locally—wreaked on its users a social and medical havoc unlike anything associated with marijuana. “Cocaine is just another level,” Mark McDaniel, the itinerant lawman, said. “It’s hard to bust. And Tindall didn’t have the training, the people, the knowledge, the technology.”\n\nTindall did have a notion, though, about who was bringing cocaine into San Augustine, and he mentioned his notion to McLeroy, of the state police, in 1987. The suspect was Lenard Jackson, a local black man who had lived for many years in Houston but still had family in San Augustine. Jackson’s brother Herbert was, in fact, the county’s first black commissioner, and he was still in office. “But we didn’t go after Lenard Jackson, because he lived in Houston,” McLeroy told me. “And Nathan, you know, probably didn’t contact anybody else who could’ve done something. Nathan only talked to people he liked.”\n\nLenard Jackson grew up in Greertown, a rural community in northern San Augustine County, at the eastern end of an old black district known as the Pre-Emption. No part of the county swarms with more ghosts than the Pre-Emption. After Emancipation, ex-slaves flocked to the area. It had been lightly settled by whites, for it was hilly and heavily wooded, roads were poor or nonexistent, and the soil was sandy. Unclaimed land could be “pre-empted,” or homesteaded, for as little as fifty cents an acre. Jackson’s great-grandfather Claiborne Greer was a slave on the Greer plantation and then one of the early black landowners, in what came to be called Greertown. The black settlers logged and cleared their fields by hand. They grew corn, peas, cotton, watermelons, and peanuts. They raised hogs and cattle and farmed with mules. People worshipped at little clapboard Baptist churches in the woods and, in summer, gathered for baseball tournaments with black teams from all over East Texas and western Louisiana.\n\nLenard Jackson, who was born in 1948, grew up as the countryside was starting to empty. The Second World War had pulled large numbers of people off the land, and after the war many chose not to return to life behind a plow or on the end of a crosscut saw. Small-scale Southern farming was becoming, in any case, less viable—Lenard Jackson picked cotton in the red lands as a boy, but cotton was then leaving San Augustine for the flatlands of West Texas—and black farmers, unable to finance new equipment and expansion, were disappearing fastest. Between 1940 and 1960, the rural black population in Texas fell fifty per cent; the number of black farmers fell seventy per cent.\n\nToday, there is no black commercial farming in Greertown or anywhere else in the Pre-Emption. Those black-owned fields still under cultivation are leased to white farmers, who use Mexican itinerant labor. Most of the old fields are now forest again—thickly overgrown with slash pine. Perhaps half the land in the Pre-Emption still belongs to blacks, and title to much of that is hopelessly mired among absentee heirs.\n\nFrank Jackson, Lenard’s father, hung on to his land. He was a farmer and logger; he and his wife had fifteen children. Lenard, the eighth, was in the tenth grade at the segregated high school in San Augustine when Frank died, in 1966. Lenard left school and went to work hauling pulpwood. Like his older siblings, most of whom had already left for California or Houston, Lenard saw plainly that his chances of making a decent living in San Augustine were bleak. The only black people doing so were schoolteachers, the undertaker, the insurance agent, and a few enterprising souls who supplemented legal incomes with bootlegging. None of those avenues were open to Lenard, and in 1969 he ended up moving to Houston.\n\nHe joined the construction workers’ union and started as a laborer. There was plenty of work: Houston boomed throughout the nineteen-seventies. Jackson rose to labor foreman, concrete foreman, general foreman. He was, from all accounts, a ferociously hard worker. He took a second job at night, and with his savings he bought a garbage truck. He landed a contract to haul garbage from Burger Kings, and found a dump that stayed open until midnight. As a labor foreman, Jackson became a kind of one-man hiring hall for other young men from San Augustine. Thus, when he went out on his own as a construction contractor, in the mid-seventies, he had a pool of loyal, experienced workers to draw on. By that time, he had married Girtha Mae Polley, who was from East Liberty—his mother’s home place, a few miles northeast of Greertown—and had bought his first house, a bungalow out among the gasworks and bayous east of Houston. His company started pouring foundations for Sambo’s, a chain of twenty-four-hour restaurants. “There were a lot of jokes,” Jackson recalled. “You know, ‘Got a bunch of Sambos out here doing the Sambo’s.’ But that didn’t bother me too much. The work was good.”\n\nThe work was very good, especially once Jackson had begun winning contracts to build the little L-shaped shopping centers, known as “strip centers,” that surround Houston in their multitudes. By the early eighties, his company, LJ Construction, employed eighty people, including most of his eleven brothers, and had jobs going all over metropolitan Houston. “If we was in Houston, and we was ridin’, I could show you some of the buildings we made to come up out of the ground,” Herbert Jackson, who occasionally worked for Lenard, told me. “Seems like we must have poured half the concrete in Houston.” Only Herbert and one disabled sister stayed for extended periods in Greertown, with their widowed mother, but all the children, led by Lenard, contributed to the maintenance of the place, and to the regular replacement of their mother’s Ford with a new one. To many people in black San Augustine, the Jacksons were, in fact, an exemplary family: hardworking and dutiful toward their elders.\n\nLenard, now the prosperous contractor, bought a lot in Pearland, a flat, windy exurb south of Houston, and built a sprawling, one-story Spanish-style brick house with six arches across the front and tinted windows. The house acquired mythic proportions back in San Augustine: Roger Hale told me that it was worth three-quarters of a million dollars, though its real value was perhaps a hundred and fifty thousand. It was a powerful symbol, in any case, of a local boy’s success in the city. Jackson also bought another such symbol: a secondhand Rolls-Royce—not, he later said, because he particularly liked the car but because his wife liked it and because it would hold its resale value. (He continued to drive a pickup truck.) He raised rabbits in his back yard, and put in a modest basketball court, and on weekends he held barbecues at his house for the many young San Augustinians who worked for him. The fact that he was widely admired and considered a fair employer sometimes put Jackson in a difficult position. “If you said you were from San Augustine, and needed money, I’d find something for you, because I knew how it was, trying to get started,” he recalled. “But that meant I worked a lot of San Augustine guys I didn’t need. And that hurt me down the line.”\n\nWhen the Texas economy crashed, in the nineteen-eighties, Houston construction went down with it. Jackson’s business began to suffer from competition with what he called “Spanish guys”—undocumented Mexican laborers working for Anglo contractors for four dollars an hour. Some of Jackson’s workers had been making more than a hundred dollars a day. He lowered that to eighty, and then, when things got desperate, to sixty.\n\nAt some point—exactly when is a matter of dispute—Jackson went into the illegal-drug trade. First marijuana, according to the state narcotics police, and then cocaine. “I had a lot of things to keep up, people to take care of,” he told me.\n\nCocaine made its way into Deep East Texas by various routes. Some came from Los Angeles, through family contacts with the Crips and the Bloods, the vast L.A. street gangs. Typically, a gang member in trouble with the law in L.A. would come to hide out with his country grandparents, find that the local cocaine market was ill-protected or nonexistent, and move to establish a franchise, bringing in drugs overland from the West Coast. Most of the cocaine trade in East Texas, however, was carried on by local entrepreneurs.\n\nBeing near Houston was convenient. “Houston has replaced Miami as the nation’s drug capital,” the United States Attorney in Beaumont told me. (California officials make the same claim for Los Angeles.) Whatever its ranking, Houston has become the clearing house for a staggering amount of cocaine. Both of the world’s preëminent cocaine empires, the Cali and the Medellín cartels of Colombia, have established large-scale import-and-distribution operations there.\n\nAmerican dealers buy from the Colombians at whatever level they can afford. The domestic dealerships are ethnically segmented—white and Latino traffickers sell powdered cocaine, mostly to white and Latino users, while African-Americans sell crack, mostly to black users—but are otherwise diffuse and loosely structured. For sophistication and corporate-style discipline, certainly no local drug organization can compete with the Colombian suppliers, who are regarded with awe by many of their retailers. “They won’t even do business with nobody that starts using drugs,” a black former crack dealer in Houston told me. “They find out you’re using, they just kill you.” This rule, if it is indeed ever applied, was definitely not followed in San Augustine in the mid-eighties, when Arthur Watts and Willie Ray (Blue Tick) Edwards, two part-time pulpwood haulers and full-time ne’er-do-wells, hooked up with a couple of low-level Colombian dealers, brothers named Aldon and Ivan Aguirre, in Houston, and began to run small quantities of cocaine up into the woods to support their own habits.\n\nThe demand for cocaine exploded with the invention of crack. In East Texas, makeshift legions of small-time dealers began shuttling between Houston and their home towns, typically buying an ounce or two of powder, “rocking it up” into crack, selling five- and ten- and twenty-dollar rocks to cover costs, and smoking up their profits. The Arthur Wattses and Blue Tick Edwardses were unlikely to be left alone in a business with such volume and positive cash flow, and in San Augustine they were soon joined by an older, far cannier, and more sober businessman—Lenard Jackson. According to the F.B.I., Jackson started buying cocaine in kilogram quantities in Houston from a mid-level Colombian connection named Celestino Morales, who was linked to the Cali cartel, and some of the young men who worked in Jackson’s construction firm started carrying it with them on their frequent trips home to San Augustine.\n\nJackson’s couriers included Harlon Kelly and his half brother Steven Kelly, who was an “outside” son of Jackson’s. Jackson had bought a modern ranch house behind his family’s farm in Greertown, and the Kelly brothers were soon doing a roaring cocaine business there, building a network of sub-dealers, many of them former high-school classmates who had either stayed in San Augustine or, like them, returned unemployed from Houston. These sub-dealers, who included Roger Hale’s son Daryl, were usually not drug users, though some, such as Harlon Kelly, had a parent who was a cocaine addict.\n\nCrack caught on in San Augustine mainly in poor black neighborhoods—in the Quarters and, especially, in the Sunset Hills housing project. “It was a good high,” Shirley Bell, a Sunset Hills resident, told me, simply. “Something to do. And everybody else was doing it.” Bell’s son, Michael, who was a friend and former classmate of the Kellys’ and Daryl Hale’s, objected to his mother’s smoking crack, though his own authority on the subject was limited by the fact that he himself was selling it. In fact, Michael Bell became one of the more successful local dealers. He had not had a job since high school—and had never left San Augustine—but he started driving a new car, bought a number of quarter horses (including one that was reported to have cost nine thousand dollars), and, in early 1989, vacationed in Acapulco with Daryl Hale and another friend. “Easy money,” his mother said flatly. “Everybody saw it, everybody wanted it.”\n\nSarah Oliphant, a Sunset Hills resident, got hooked on crack in November, 1988. She soon lost her job, and eventually her health. “These whole projects, we was really lookin’ rough and ugly,” she recalled. “Everybody skinny and sickly. I wore a sweater cap, ’cause I wouldn’t comb my hair. I got down to ninety-eight pounds.” That’s perhaps half of what she weighs today. “She was po’ as a snake,” her mother put in.\n\nA few whites got into crack, but the illegal drugs of choice among whites remained marijuana and methamphetamine, or speed, both of which are produced locally, the East Texas woods being almost as convenient for meth labs, which give off a powerful telltale odor, as for pot growing. Among a few white crack addicts who gained the trust of the black dealers in San Augustine were Dave Husband’s daughter, Sheila Fussell, and the troubled heir to a drygoods fortune, who used to drive over from Louisiana.\n\nThe radius of the San Augustine cocaine market grew well beyond the county’s boundaries during the first half of 1989. Customers, and even small-time dealers, from the surrounding counties (and from Fort Polk, a Louisiana Army base eighty-five miles away, where at least a regiment of crackheads seemed to be stationed) started making their way to San Augustine—to Jackson’s ranch house, or to Sunset Hills, or to Blue Tick Edwards’ trailer, out on a country road known as Spur 85—to score. Some San Augustine dealers also went on the road: one would rent a motel room in, say, Center, the next town north, for a weekend and sell off a load of rocks to local users. For San Augustine’s young entrepreneurs, who were accustomed to being patronized by their traditional rivals in Center as the natives of a backward county without industry or initiative, it was a sweet turnabout.\n\nAnother kind of socioeconomic turnabout was occurring within San Augustine, as a growing number of young black men began to display unprecedented buying power at local car dealerships and at clothing and jewelry and furniture stores. In some cases, these were the same establishments that had once punished the ancestors of the prosperous new customers for nonpayment of their bills with whippings or forced land-title transfers. The drug dealers paid cash. But the most startling image of the new black prosperity, and surely the most difficult for many whites to accept, was Lenard Jackson, up from Houston, tooling around in his blue Rolls-Royce.\n\nDave Husband, people often say, went into the drug trade simply because he couldn’t bear the thought of Jackson’s being a more successful entrepreneur than he was. More likely, Husband, who owned a tavern where a lot of small-scale drug dealing went on, just saw a business opportunity too tempting to pass up. “Daddy was raised to bootleg, and somewhere back in his head he probably never saw no difference between bootlegging and the drug business,” Sheila Fussell says. “He told me later that he’d started losing most of his liquor business to the drug business. And he just ‘wanted to see what the drug business was like.’ Those were his words.”\n\nJackson, instead of resenting the new competition, apparently welcomed Husband’s entry into the trade, perhaps on the theory that Husband might divert some of the unwelcome law-enforcement attention he himself had begun to attract. According to the F.B.I., Jackson introduced Husband to Celestino Morales, in Houston, and Morales began to supply Husband with cocaine directly. In San Augustine, Husband dealt mainly in wholesale quantities, but Blue Tick Edwards recalls Husband’s coming around to his trailer, ostensibly to help him break down a package and cook it up into crack, but really, Edwards believed, to watch his retail sales operation, to collect his payment before Edwards could spend it, and, if possible, to steal a few of Edwards’ customers.\n\nHow extensive did the San Augustine drug trade become? The F.B.I., as has been noted, announced that seventy-five pounds of cocaine, with a street value of more than three million dollars, was passing through the county each week by mid-1989. These figures, if they were accurate, would have made San Augustine a major regional drug-distribution center. But other law-enforcement officials, such as Kenneth Kidwell, of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Tyler, questioned whether the drug problem in San Augustine was really any different from or bigger than the drug problem in other East Texas communities.\n\nBe that as it may, Nathan Tindall’s main challenger in the 1988 election for sheriff—a local butcher and former grocer named Charles Bryan, who had no law-enforcement experience—made “drugs” virtually the entire basis of his campaign, and it was soon clear that he was reaching voters with his message. People frightened by the rapid growth of the drug trade, or by the ravages of crack, began moving toward Bryan. This group included both whites, some of whom simply didn’t like the idea of blacks’ getting uppity—a prejudice that “drugs” covered nicely—and blacks, who had traditionally voted for Tindall but were now worried that he wasn’t doing enough to stop drugs.\n\nIt wasn’t true that Tindall was doing little or nothing about the problem. He had suspected Lenard Jackson a year earlier, after all, and had reported him to the state narcotics police then. He ran regular stings on dealers and users, and harassed the more hapless mid-level dealers, like Blue Tick Edwards, mercilessly. “Mr. Nathan arrested me so many times,” Edwards recalled. “He picked me up every two or three months. Caught me once in the projects with some cocaine, and got me and my wife thrown out of Sunset Hills. That’s how we ended up in my trailer.”\n\nStill, a consensus obviously formed among voters that it was time for a change in the sheriff’s office—that, for whatever reasons, cocaine was getting away from Tindall. The solidly black precincts still went heavily for the high sheriff, but the county’s white voters, particularly the couple of thousand newcomers down on Sam Rayburn Reservoir, put Bryan over the top in the Democratic primary in the spring, and then, when Tindall managed to get his name on the ballot for the general election, defeated him again in November.\n\nOperation White Tornado began as two separate investigations—one local, the other external. The local effort was the initiative of Larry Saurage, the chief deputy sheriff, whom Charles Bryan hired when he took office. Bryan, though he looks the part of a Texas sheriff—he’s tall, heavy, firm-jawed, and white-haired, and wears a white cowboy hat—had wisely grasped the fact that his career as a butcher and groceryman had not prepared him for a leadership role in law enforcement, and he had gone looking for an experienced chief deputy. Saurage, a well-travelled lawman who was then working narcotics down in Chambers County, between Houston and Beaumont, fit the bill. He came to San Augustine in January of 1989, and within a few weeks he had brought in Betty Donatto, a black undercover narcotics agent from the Liberty County sheriff’s office (Liberty is next door to Chambers), to help him put together drug cases in San Augustine. Donatto, passing herself off as Bennie Lee Thibodeaux, a good-time girl originally from Louisiana, was paired up by Saurage with a local informant, who helped her infiltrate the county’s drug scene, starting in the Sunset Hills housing project.\n\nMeanwhile, Marvin McLeroy, of the state narcotics office, had begun his own investigation in San Augustine the previous September, prompted by persistent reports that Lenard Jackson, Dave Husband, Blue Tick Edwards, Arthur Watts, and Daryl Hale were dealing drugs, and by rumors of corruption in the sheriff’s office. McLeroy, without informing any local agency of his activities, used informants to buy cocaine from Arthur Watts and Daryl Hale, and invited federal authorities into the investigation. (Charles Bryan, while still a candidate for sheriff, had also got in touch with the United States Attorney’s office in Beaumont about the drug problem in San Augustine.) Stuart Platt, an assistant federal prosecutor, now took charge of the investigation, with field command going to F.B.I. Special Agent Zechariah (Zack) Shelton. Shelton had played a leading part in a 1988 investigation of Sheriff James Wade, of Orange County, near Beaumont, which resulted in Wade’s conviction on federal drug and corruption charges. And Platt and Shelton’s chief quarry in San Augustine seems to have been, from the outset, Nathan Tindall—whom Shelton later described to me as “a true boss-hog sheriff.” The state and federal investigators continued to shun local law-enforcement offices in San Augustine. For local assistance, they turned to the Shelby County district attorney’s office, in Center, and to Robert Cartwright, a young policeman in Port Arthur, whose father, John Matthew Cartwright, was a patrolman in the San Augustine town police.\n\nBut then, in March, Platt and Shelton’s men began to run across Betty Donatto’s trail in San Augustine. Concerned that her investigation might inadvertently abort theirs, they went to the Liberty County sheriff’s office, learned of Saurage’s operation, and got in touch with Saurage. According to Shelton, Saurage was angry to discover that outside agencies were working on his new turf. He agreed to coöperate with the F.B.I. and the state narcotics office, however, though his boss, Charles Bryan, whose ability to keep professional secrets was untested, was to be left in the dark. John Matthew Cartwright’s superior, the town chief of police, was also left in the dark—even though the command center for Platt and Shelton’s operation was set up in a trailer in a pecan orchard behind Cartwright’s mother’s house. (A tornado that spring, which rocked the trailer, gave rise to the operation’s catchy title.) For Chief Deputy Saurage, actively running undercover agents and informants right under the nose of even an inexperienced sheriff soon proved to be more trouble than it was worth, and in April he and his colleagues let Charles Bryan in on the operation. According to the F.B.I.’s Shelton, “We just told Bryan, ‘Stay out of our way, and we’ll make you a hero.’ ”\n\nBetty Donatto, who is a sleepy-eyed, soft-voiced, russet-haired woman in her early forties, remained the key agent of the combined operation. She had been doing police work for only a few years, having worked previously as a computer operator in California and as a journalist in Liberty County, but, once she started in law enforcement, she had risen quickly, becoming a small-town police chief and then discovering a talent for undercover work. Her partner in San Augustine, a local crack addict named Bo Garrett, had been dubious about her at first. Her skin was too light for her to pass unaccosted in the black drug world, he thought. But Donatto figured that the Louisiana cover story would help ease suspicion, since Louisiana was known for its mixed-race population; and, besides, her real upbringing in a black family in East Texas gave her the wherewithal to blend in socially.\n\n“It worked good,” she told me later, in a restaurant in Houston. “We just told people I was Bo’s girlfriend, living in Houston. I started out buying twenty-dollar rocks, and moved on up to one-fifties. If people wondered why I never smoked, I told ’em I worked for the airlines—‘Hey, I gotta take a pee test tomorrow.’ I’d say I was just up there to see Bo, and I was buying for somebody in Houston. I was driving a white Corvette—a seized vehicle from Liberty County. That got their attention.”\n\nDonatto laughed lightly. “I mean, San Augustine was sad. A lot of the people there didn’t even have cars. It was like they had no connection to the outside world. After a while, I started feeling like Santa Claus. I used to buy a box of chicken, maybe a case of beer, and drive up into the projects, and they’d all come crowd around the car, ask me for chicken and beer, and tell me everything that was going on. ‘Hey, Jackson’s in town!’\n\n“Nobody was afraid of the city police. The crooks were afraid of Tindall, and they told me to watch out for him, because he still ran the show, even if he was in the background. But San Augustine was pretty unusual—at least, when I was there. It was so open and free. And you could kind of understand it, because you’re really away from everything up there. If you had the right amount of money, it was like you could set up your own little world, and nobody could touch you. I could see how Dave Husband and Lenard Jackson thought they’d never get caught. There were all these weak-minded people around who they could just control. In the projects, the Ranch”—Lenard Jackson’s house in Greertown—“was considered Heaven.”\n\nDonatto befriended some of the local crackheads and dealers, including Sarah Oliphant and Michael Bell. She bought cocaine from Blue Tick Edwards, out in his trailer on Spur 85, on several occasions, sometimes encountering Roger Hale there (those encounters helped put Hale away), and ultimately managed to overcome the suspicions of Willie Earl Dade, Tindall’s ex-deputy, and buy half an ounce from him behind a tavern on U.S. 96, for six hundred dollars—the largest purchase she made in San Augustine.\n\nShe had no luck buying dope from Dave Husband, however. “The word was, Husband didn’t deal anything small. It was half a kilo on up, and you needed an introduction. We tried to make buys with a couple of different informants, but they both failed. I was there for the second one. It was a white girl from Jasper, who said she’d bought from him before. But Husband just said he didn’t know what she was talking about.”\n\nDonatto knew that a major target of the federal investigation was Nathan Tindall. “They told me to find out anything I could about Tindall being crooked,” she said. “But all I ever got was hearsay.”\n\nEventually, Donatto made her way out to the paradise of Lenard Jackson’s ranch house, in the company of a young woman, “a hyper crack smoker” whom she had hooked up with. This young woman was among the select customers who were welcome to visit the ranch house, and Donatto watched her make a buy from “Jackson’s sons,” as she knew Harlon and Steven Kelly. Donatto later began going out there on her own, and succeeded in buying half an ounce of crack from Roy Jackson, one of Lenard’s brothers. Roy subsequently invited her “to go partying to Louisiana with him.” Donatto wanted to go, but Shelton and Saurage thought it sounded too risky. “Zack was a nervous wreck about me,” Donatto recalled. “I appreciated that, because working in San Augustine was lonely. Working undercover for a long time gets weird. They say you should never do it for more than three months. You forget who you are. You can’t think about anything else. I’d go home to Liberty County to see my daughter, but all I could think about was how I wasn’t really getting what the feds wanted. I actually couldn’t wait to get back in my dirty jeans and my Corvette, and this straw hat I always wore up there.”\n\nOther local informants were also used. One of them was a small-time dealer named Ricky Davis. Fitted out with a tape recorder, Davis allegedly managed to buy half an ounce of powdered cocaine in April from Dave Husband’s brother Buck—though the tape ran out before the deal was consummated. Davis claimed that in the past he had bought cocaine from Dave Husband himself, and also from Husband’s son Neil. But Davis had a credibility problem. When his controllers heard that he was still selling drugs, even while he was informing, they took him to a secluded park in San Augustine to discuss the matter with him. Davis denied the reports vehemently. Then Betty Donatto stepped out from behind a tree. “He had been selling to me,” Donatto said, laughing. “He didn’t know I was a narc. Ricky about fainted. We worked together after that. But he was always a nervous wreck.”\n\nIn late April, “pen registers” were attached to the telephones of various suspects, recording the time, the date, and the number dialled for outgoing calls, and in May the F.B.I. and the state narcotics police began actually tapping the telephones of more than a dozen “subject individuals” in and around San Augustine. Agent Shelton’s application to a federal district judge for permission to do more wiretapping, including Nathan Tindall’s phone, described the progress of Operation White Tornado, and concluded, “Normal investigative procedures have been tried and failed.” Some of the failures of normal investigative procedures were evident in the application itself, which described Michael Bell as being married to his mother, assured the judge that Dave Husband owned the town’s one hotel (this would have been news to Husband), and twice described Husband as Nathan Tindall’s nephew.\n\nThe “Facts and Circumstances Overview” section of Shelton’s application relied heavily on “facts” obtained from confidential informants; the news that Husband was Tindall’s nephew, for instance, came from two separate informants, the second “corroborating” the first, according to Shelton. One of these two informants was in the county jail in Houston, had been to San Augustine once, and had evidently never met Tindall, yet was able to assure Shelton that Tindall was corrupt. The other informant—who was unnamed in the application—was Ricky Davis, and he claimed that he had seen Edgar Price, one of Lenard Jackson’s couriers, pay Tindall a thousand dollars during a traffic stop in 1987 or 1988. “Affiant believes,” wrote Shelton, referring to himself, “that Nathan Tindall was integrally involved in providing protection to various cocaine dealers.” He added that he suspected Tindall might be laundering money for Husband and Arthur Watts through a local bank where he was then working. Shelton even managed to interpret Marvin McLeroy’s report that Tindall had approached him about Lenard Jackson’s activities in 1987 as evidence that Jackson must have started paying off Tindall then.\n\nThe additional wiretaps were authorized, and the investigators, listening in from their trailer in the pecan orchard, continued to gather information on the San Augustine drug trade. Some of the dealers, although they were usually infuriatingly vague and wary on the phone, made some reasonably incriminating remarks, but Nathan Tindall apparently never said anything of interest. “I’m just lucky that Dave Husband and them others never had accounts at my bank,” Tindall told me. “Because if they did the feds would have put that on me, called it laundering.”\n\nIn late May, the commanders of Operation White Tornado decided that it was time to pounce. Betty Donatto was astonished. “I couldn’t believe they wanted to pull the cord then,” she says. “I had just worked my way up from the projects to the Ranch, and I only needed a couple more months. We could have got more on the Houston connection, Louisiana, the Colombians. Zack Shelton knew I thought it was too soon. But he said Ricky Davis said the crooks were getting suspicious of me and were going to bump me off. Except everybody knew that Ricky was a nervous wreck. He just wanted the whole thing to end.”\n\nAnd so, late on the rainy afternoon of June 2, 1989, a vast paramilitary convoy, complete with newspaper reporters and TV camera crews, streamed into San Augustine, carrying more than two hundred heavily armed agents from the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration, the United States Customs Service, the United States Marshals, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Army’s Criminal Investigation Division, the state Highway Patrol, the state police, the Texas Rangers, and police departments and sheriff’s offices in half a dozen nearby counties and parishes, with helicopters thundering overhead. Houses, taverns, trailers, and liquor stores were raided on the strength of seventeen federal search warrants. Property was seized and suspects were arrested on the basis of three sealed federal indictments and sixteen criminal complaints. In the TV footage, burly agents swarm up U.S. 96, brandishing automatic weapons and shouting as they order frightened black people down on their faces in the mud. Lenard Jackson, who, with his wife, had attended the high-school graduation of a niece and a nephew up in Shelby County that afternoon, was stopped on the highway by a patrol car backed up by a helicopter. He was made to stand spread-eagled, his hands on the hot hood of his Rolls-Royce, a gun at his head. Dave Husband was arrested at his store. Willie Earl Dade was found in his girlfriend’s trailer, about to cook up a batch of cocaine—the only drugs actually found in the raid. Little or no resistance was offered. The only injury occurred when Blue Tick Edwards, surprised in his trailer, tried to flee, and dislocated his shoulder in the ensuing struggle. “Me and my wife just been laying up in the bed all day, using drugs and making love, and I didn’t know what was going on,” he said later. By nightfall, thirty-one suspects had been taken into custody. Tindall, who had not been named in either the indictments or the complaints, was not arrested.\n\nBetty Donatto was there for the raid, but did little. “I was in a vehicle with some F.B.I. guys,” she recalled. “And they had every type of gun you can name. Machine guns, AK-47s. Of course, they didn’t need all them guns and dogs and a helicopter in little San Augustine. But I kept quiet. I just figured, This is really gonna make Larry and his sheriff look good. That’s what this is about.” And on the courthouse square that evening, watching the crowd applaud and the TV cameras jostle for position as a handcuffed Lenard Jackson was hustled into the jail, Donatto marvelled at Charles Bryan’s performance. “Larry’s sheriff,” who had been so firmly excluded from Operation White Tornado, was reaping the reward that Zack Shelton had promised him. “There he was, shaking hands and grinning and accepting all the credit,” Donatto recalled. “And I told my captain, Tom, who came up from Liberty County for the raid, ‘I can’t believe this.’ At the end of the whole situation, I just had to give that man an Academy Award.”\n\nNaturally, Nathan Tindall said that if it had been up to him he’d have conducted Operation White Tornado by telephone, just calling up the suspects and telling them to come on down to the jailhouse and bring their dope. He’d probably have got more dope that way than the pittance the feds found, too, he reckoned. Why did the feds stage the raid when they did? According to Tindall, the answer was that they were nervous because he, Tindall, had just started work as an investigator for Charles Mitchell, the district attorney (who knew nothing about Operation White Tornado), and they were afraid that he might break up the drug trade himself, stealing all their glory. As it happened, Mitchell let Tindall go immediately, reasoning that the former sheriff would not make an effective investigator while under a cloud of federal suspicion.\n\nThat cloud only darkened in the days after the raid, as veiled and not so veiled charges began to rain down on Tindall. Stuart Platt explained to reporters that Operation White Tornado had been necessary because local law enforcement in San Augustine had been “compromised.” The F.B.I., during detention hearings in Beaumont for the White Tornado defendants, testified, according to the Beaumont Enterprise, that “Tindall was difficult to work with and offered little cooperation on drug investigations.”\n\nIt seemed only a matter of time before he would be indicted, his disgrace complete. On the day after the drug raid, Tindall was served with a federal court order to turn over the bank records of seven of the White Tornado suspects, and a few weeks later he was subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury in Beaumont to answer allegations by one of the suspects that he had taken payoffs. In early July, Tindall’s house was searched twice in one week by Zack Shelton and Larry Saurage. On the second visit, they were accompanied by I.R.S. agents. Tindall’s tax records were seized, along with dozens of old guns he had taken from the evidence room at the sheriff’s office when he left, and a small bag of marijuana. The marijuana was a prop that Tindall had been using for years in anti-drug lectures at schools, and the guns still had evidence tags on them—Tindall had left instructions that anybody who wanted to reclaim a weapon should get in touch with him—but the episode did little to improve his press. “SEARCH OF EX-SHERIFF’S HOUSE NETS GUNS, DRUGS” was how the Beaumont Enterprise played it, illustrating its story with a photograph of Charles Bryan with the confiscated arsenal. The San Augustine Tribune, a timid weekly in normal times, actually ran verbatim several paragraphs of the search warrant that Larry Saurage had sworn out in order to enter the home of the county’s former boss hog.\n\nBryan, Saurage, Shelton, Platt, and Platt’s superior, United States Attorney Bob Wortham, were the local (and not so local) heroes of the hour. Zack Shelton was shown on ABC News making a speech on the San Augustine courthouse square, where, according to Peter Jennings, residents were “cheering the police who liberated their town.”\n\nAs a news story, Operation White Tornado worked. It had good guys, bad guys (Lenard Jackson’s seized Rolls-Royce made countless TV appearances, as the lurid emblem of a black man’s ill-gotten gains), and a great little official-corruption angle. It also revealed a vivid new front in the war on drugs—a picturesque, one-stoplight Southern town, where American flags hung over canopied sidewalks on the courthouse square—and even some San Augustinians seemed pleased to see the raid in that quasi-national context. Dr. Curtis Haley, a conservative local landowner and physician, circulated a public resolution, signed by some six hundred of his neighbors, thanking Bob Wortham and his colleagues and urging them, “Please continue with your crusade of providing a Drug Free America not only in this community and county but all others in the great State of Texas.” Virtually nothing was said publicly about the disparity between the amount of cocaine alleged to have been moving through San Augustine—the often repeated seventy-five pounds a week, worth more than three million dollars—and the amount actually found during the raid. Two hundred agents making a lightning strike had turned up only five ounces of drugs.\n\nThe White Tornado defendants, for their part, could not seem to win for losing. Barely a week after the raid, it emerged that Dave Husband was now suspected of having buried the bodies of an undetermined number of undocumented Mexican workers on his land. Government bulldozers began turning acres of rolling pastureland along the Attoyac River into a vast open-pit mine while the press corps camped out under the trees. Husband had employed illegal Mexican labor for many years, and five undocumented workers had, in fact, been found in a trailer behind his liquor store during the drug raid. But the workers found in the trailer later signed a joint statement asserting that, contrary to press reports, they had not been beaten by Husband. And no bodies were ever found.\n\nThe number of defendants rose eventually to fifty-seven, and the guilty pleas began to flow in early August. Daryl Hale, Roger’s son, was the first White Tornado defendant to agree to coöperate with prosecutors in exchange for reduced charges—a single count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. By the end of September, Blue Tick Edwards, Willie Earl Dade, Roger Hale, Edgar Price, Michael Bell, Ivan Aguirre (Aldon Aguirre was still at large), and more than a dozen others had pleaded out. Each time someone pleaded, the remaining defendants grew more nervous, for it meant another finger quite likely being pointed at them. Thus did the stampede build, to twenty and thirty and forty guilty pleas. By early 1990, Dave Husband and Lenard Jackson and their immediate families and associates were the only significant defendants left.\n\nBut the federal prosecutors still did not have the man they wanted: Nathan Tindall. Lenard Jackson and company probably knew nothing incriminating about Tindall, the prosecutors thought, and so the issue did not figure in the negotiations with them. Those negotiations finally resulted, in March, in guilty pleas that brought down sentences of fifteen years on Lenard (his wife, the former Girtha Mae Polley, did not live to see him go to prison: she had committed suicide in December) and ten years each on his brother Roy, his son Steven Kelly, and Harlon Kelly. (Because these are federal sentences, they contain no possibility of parole.)\n\nDave Husband was another matter. The prosecutors’ first offer to Husband was five years, and the return of his liquor store, which had been confiscated. Husband, convinced that the evidence against him was weak, turned it down. As his fellow-defendants began to coöperate, agreeing to testify against him, the offers from the prosecutors got less generous. Finally, in September, Husband agreed to plead guilty and to coöperate with the government in exchange for a sentence of twelve years, the forfeiture of his store, and a dismissal of the charges against his son. Coöperating with the government meant telling investigators what he knew about Nathan Tindall.\n\nAnd then Husband’s lawyer, Joseph C. Hawthorn, of Beaumont, made a colossal mistake. After coming to a verbal plea agreement with the prosecutors and with the federal judge, but before formalizing the agreement in court that afternoon, he let his client be debriefed by Stuart Platt, Zack Shelton, and Malcolm Bales, one of Platt’s colleagues. In barely half an hour of conversation, Husband told the government the sum total of what he had on Tindall: nothing. “And Tindall was it,” Hawthorn says. “He was our only bargaining chip.” That afternoon, the judge changed his mind. Now he didn’t like the sentence, and after a private conversation with Platt and Bales he rejected the plea agreement. Hawthorn’s appeal to have the judge recused from the case was denied. And the government was no longer interested in any plea agreement with Husband.\n\nSix months later, on the day that his son was to enter a guilty plea, Husband, now frantic that his son, whom he had drafted into the drug business to begin with, might go to jail, made the government an extraordinary offer. He would plead guilty to every charge against him—eight felony counts—if they would just assure him that his son wouldn’t go to jail. The prosecutors agreed immediately. And Dave Husband, who was then forty-four years old, was subsequently sentenced, under the mandatory minimums that attach to all federal drug violations, to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nExcept for its drastic incongruity among the punishments received by the other White Tornado defendants, Charles Mitchell has no problem with the sentence Dave Husband got. He has no problem, for that matter, with asking for the death sentence when a capital murder case comes his way. He does, however, have reservations about the way business is conducted in federal courts these days. “The new evidentiary rules in these drug cases, allowing what would ordinarily be hearsay, and so forth, are pretty outrageous,” he says. “I mean, it’s not much of a challenge to try a case when you’re allowed to use evidence that would be inadmissible in a state court.” And under such rules it’s not much of a challenge to win guilty pleas from defendants once fellow- defendants start testifying against them. Mitchell believes that in the Texas courts, which are where he does his prosecuting, most of the cases against the White Tornado defendants would have been much more difficult to win, for lack of evidence. And Dave Husband would have walked free after a state court sentenced his son Neil to ten years for possession with intent to deliver cocaine, in what even Mitchell, who prosecuted Neil, agreed was a subversion of Dave Husband’s plea agreement with federal prosecutors. But when Husband’s lawyer argued in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that the plea agreement had been broken, the federal prosecutors contended that they had no control over state prosecutors; the judge agreed, and let Husband’s life sentence stand.\n\nMitchell also had questions about the perennial federal investigation of Nathan Tindall. “If they really believed that he was putting fines in his pocket, they just needed to send an agent up here driving drunk,” he said. “That’s what I’d do. Buy him three or four quarts of beer, send him up here throwing bottles out the window. That would be pretty easy to clear up.” With Tindall out of office, the feds were reduced, in Mitchell’s view, to chasing shadows. “I could get on that phone right now and say, ‘Tindall’s got a cow out here,’ ” Mitchell told me. “And they would figure out a federal crime he was committing and be on his butt.”\n\nWhy are the federal authorities so intent on Tindall?\n\n“Well, they want to do what’s right,” Mitchell said. “If there’s a dirty sheriff, they want to prosecute him. But, of course, sheriff’s offices are also a fountainhead—or a cesspool, depending on how you look at it—of publicity.”\n\nThe wave of publicity that accompanied Operation White Tornado left Mitchell unmoved, at best. “It was all just media hype,” he said. “Lawyers in the square holding a pep rally—that borders on unethical behavior. Am I supposed to call a pep rally every time I go to try a murder case? Tell the world ‘I’m going to cut out killing’? It would be popular, but it wouldn’t mean very much.” The raid itself had been a pointless display, in Mitchell’s view, since of all the suspects only Dave Husband and Lenard Jackson could conceivably have fled prosecution. Routine arrests would have sufficed for everyone else.\n\nWithin the complex law-enforcement coalition that mounted Operation White Tornado, there were strains, inevitably, and after the drug raid they only got worse. The main point of contention was the division of spoils—who got what among the assets seized and ultimately forfeited. While Charles Bryan had been allowed to claim a major share of credit for the raid, his office was allotted just five per cent of the proceeds—the same amount that went to the San Augustine town police, and only a third of what the Liberty County sheriff’s office received. According to federal officials, these allotments were determined by the actual contribution of each agency to the operation. Sheriff Bryan, who had evidently come to believe his own claims, was furious, and let the world know it, even vowing publicly not to let the F.B.I. back into San Augustine County. This was an empty threat, and federal officials responded by publicly announcing that the San Augustine sheriff’s office had played no substantial role in Operation White Tornado, and by privately voicing scorn for Bryan’s abilities, even suggesting that his incompetence had helped scuttle a post-raid investigation that might have netted major drug dealers in Houston. Eventually, the importance of the San Augustine drug trade was subtly downgraded by federal authorities. “I like local law enforcement to think that the biggest problems in the world are in their own back yard,” Bob Wortham, the United States Attorney in Beaumont, told me. “That way, they take things seriously.” Stuart Platt, Wortham’s chief assistant, said, “You could do these types of cases in every town in East Texas.”\n\nPost-raid squabbling also broke out in San Augustine itself. Curt Goetz, the mayor, designed a stone marker for the courthouse lawn to commemorate White Tornado, but Charles Bryan and Larry Saurage were outraged when they discovered that Goetz’s own name would be chiselled near the top of the list of the heroes of the raid, just above the names of Charles Mitchell and Jack Nichols, the county judge—this despite the fact that Goetz, Mitchell, and Nichols had, by their own admission, not even known about the investigation until the raid occurred. And Larry Saurage’s name was relegated to the bottom of Goetz’s marker. Sheriff Bryan, who believes he is officially responsible for the courthouse lawn, made his objections known to Goetz. “I told him just what I’d do if he put that thing up,” Bryan told me. “I said I’d wrap a chain around it, pull it out of the ground with my truck, drag it over to his house, and dump it in his front yard.” The marker proposal was tabled for further consideration.\n\nSomehow, nearly all of White Tornado’s principal characters managed to get together at a one-year anniversary celebration, dubbed Drug Independence Day, on the San Augustine courthouse square. Curt Goetz, Bob Wortham, Stuart Platt, and Zack Shelton all spoke, along with United States Representative Jim Chapman and Kenny Houston, of the National Football League’s Hall of Fame. (Larry Saurage boycotted the celebration, though his name was on the program as a host.) Blackhawk helicopters from the United States Customs Service flew in for the day, and President Bush sent a telegram. Final success in the war on drugs was the consensus prediction. “Our commitment to eliminating narcotics cannot be diluted,” Representative Chapman proclaimed. Media coverage was enthusiastic.\n\nBut for those who read to the end of the list of nearly two hundred official invitees in the program for Drug Independence Day there was a small surprise waiting: “N. L. Tindall.” The disgraced ex-sheriff evidently still had some influential local supporters. While the federal authorities were still pursuing him—indeed, they were about to subpoena the records of his myriad land trades—he had still not been charged. After all the bad press he had received, and all the federal investigative attention, the fact that he was alive at all as a public figure seemed remarkable.\n\nIt even seemed to amaze the state police. More than a year after the anniversary celebration, I was talking to a group of state narcotics officers in Lufkin, and I mentioned that I had heard that Tindall was thinking about running for sheriff of San Augustine County again. There was a long, stunned silence. Finally, Ricky Allen, a huge, bearded undercover agent, spat tobacco juice into a can and said, “Seems like Nathan survived a pretty hard little old punch over there.” I had the impression that the other old narcs in the room were struggling not to smile.\n\nThe possibility that Tindall might rise from his political grave—and the likelihood of his resurrection seemed to grow with each passing week—posed an interesting question: Were San Augustinians somehow unhappy with the results of Operation White Tornado?\n\nCertainly the San Augustine economy had been pretty well flattened by the drug raid. The late Edward Clark, the county’s leading banker, said, “Money totally disappeared from this town after the drug bust. Stores that had been selling hundred-dollar hats, fifty-dollar shoes, their customers were just gone.”\n\nEven more, perhaps, than businesses, poor families felt the raid’s impact. Susan Ramsey, a social worker, said, “Some of my clients did better after the raid. They stopped doing crack, and started getting their hair done. Later on, though, the financial repercussions began to be felt.” Mary Warren, the county’s welfare director, said, “That bust just ruined the economy here. It’s as simple as that. It increased our caseload directly.”\n\nBut the economic blow delivered by the drug raid wasn’t simply a matter of removing a few dozen free-spending cocaine dealers from the county. There was a more general chilling effect, according to many black residents. “Like we used to have street jams out by my house,” a teen-age logger told me. Street jams, he explained, were big parties, with music and dancing (but no drugs that he ever saw). “Then, after the drug raid happened, we never had another one. People used to come over from Lufkin and Nacogdoches. Now ain’t nobody interested in coming here.”\n\nAnd it wasn’t only black people who were put off San Augustine by the raid. At a restaurant called Raymond’s, out in the woods north of town, a barmaid told me, “This place used to be a gold mine. It was open seven nights a week.” By the time I visited Raymond’s, it was open two nights a week, and on the night I ate there I was the only patron. What happened? “A drug bust happened,” the barmaid said, making a sour face. She was a young, tousled-looking white woman, and Raymond’s, I learned, was and always had been a segregated establishment: whites only. Had the former patrons all been drug dealers? “Some of them was,” the barmaid said. “But none of them got arrested. Mostly, there was just a lot of money in circulation. Now San Augustine’s like a "
