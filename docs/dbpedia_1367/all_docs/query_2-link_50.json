        "text": "Claremont police have arrested a man suspected of two robberies in town— and say he used a fake gun to commit the offenses.\n\n26-year-old Davis Palomino, from La Puente, was arrested Wednesday at the Claremont Lodge Hotel located at 736 S. Indian Hill Bl. following a civil disturbance call, according to Claremont Police Lieutenant Jason Walters.\n\n\"While at the location, officers recognized a subject who matched the description of the suspect from two armed robberies that occurred within the past week in the city,\" Walters said, adding that one of the robberies had occurred at the Yum Yum Donuts on S. Indian Hill Blvd. on June 14— just a half mile away from the hotel.\n\nThe other robbery had occurred on Second St. in the Village on June 15.\n\n\"A search of the suspect’s vehicle revealed a replica handgun and clothing similar to what the suspect wore during the Yum-Yum Donuts robbery,\" the lieutenant said.\n\nAfter police made the alleged connection to the crimes, Palomino— who has prior arrests for theft, driving under the influence and battery— was taken into custody without incident, according to Walters. He was taken to the Claremont jail, and booked in lieu of $50,000 bail on robbery charges.\n\nPalomino is due in court on June 21."
