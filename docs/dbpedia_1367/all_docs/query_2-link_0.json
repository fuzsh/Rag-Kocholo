        "text": "Our educational mission focuses on our three core constituencies: students, faculty and alumni. There is an obvious interdependence among these three groups: By attracting the top students, faculty interest is magnified; likewise, enabling professors to do their best work and supplying them with the most desirable resources allows us to attract young scholars who are motivated and talented. Similarly, the more tangible the impact the Law School has on our community, the more engaged our alumni become. Our graduates are energized by the intellectual excitement of the school, enriching their own professional lives and adding still more luster to their alma mater's reputation. Loyal alumni give back, so that a cycle of generosity, learning, appreciation and active participation in our school and society continues."
