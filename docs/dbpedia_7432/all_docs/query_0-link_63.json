        "text": "What is osteomyelitis?\n\nOsteomyelitis is a bone infection. It happens when a bacterial infection or a fungal infection spreads to your bones.\n\nOsteomyelitis causes painful swelling in your bone marrow. It can affect any of your bones. Kids with osteomyelitis most commonly have it in their leg or arm bones. Adults usually develop it in their vertebrae (the bones that make up your spine) or hips.\n\nIf it’s not treated in time, osteomyelitis can cause permanent bone loss and necrosis (tissue death).\n\nTypes of osteomyelitis\n\nThere are a few types of osteomyelitis:\n\nAcute osteomyelitis: A bone infection that happens after an infection spreads to your bones. Acute osteomyelitis is the most common type.\n\nVertebral osteomyelitis: Osteomyelitis that infects the vertebrae in your spine.\n\nChronic osteomyelitis: Bone infections that aren’t completely cured after treatment can linger in your body and come back (recur) months or years later. Taking the full dose of any medication your healthcare provider prescribes to kill the initial infection is the best way to prevent chronic osteomyelitis.\n\nHow common is osteomyelitis?\n\nResearchers think fewer than 25 per 100,000 people experience osteomyelitis each year. However, some studies have found it’s much more common among people who need to stay in the hospital — as high as 1 out of every 675 hospital admissions.\n\nExperts think this difference may be because people who are admitted to the hospital often have health conditions or injuries that make them much more susceptible to bacteria and fungi getting into their blood and bones.\n\nWhat are osteomyelitis symptoms?\n\nOsteomyelitis symptoms can vary depending on which type you have and which of your bones are infected. The most common bone infection symptoms include:\n\nFever.\n\nA general feeling of being sick or unwell.\n\nBone pain.\n\nChills.\n\nSweating.\n\nNausea and vomiting.\n\nSkin discoloration.\n\nSwelling (inflammation).\n\nA feeling of heat or warmth on your skin.\n\nPus or discharge (if the infection is near a wound or surgery site).\n\nVertebral osteomyelitis also usually causes low back pain. Some people with chronic osteomyelitis don’t have symptoms.\n\nWhat is the main cause of osteomyelitis?\n\nInfections that spread to your bones cause osteomyelitis. It usually happens when an infection on the surface of your skin (like at a wound or a surgery site) gets into your bloodstream and spreads to your bone marrow (the spongy center of some bones).\n\nWhat are the risk factors?\n\nAnyone can develop an infection that causes osteomyelitis, but some people have a higher risk, including people who:\n\nAre younger than 20 or older than 50.\n\nHave open wounds after an injury or trauma.\n\nHave recently had surgery, especially arthroplasty (joint replacement) or other procedures where surgeons implant pieces into your body — including pins and screws to repair bone fractures (broken bones).\n\nExperience puncture injuries (something stabbing into your body).\n\nHave pressure injuries (bedsores).\n\nPeople with health conditions or who need treatments that weaken their immune system are more likely to develop osteomyelitis, including:\n\nSickle cell anemia.\n\nDiabetes (especially if you have diabetes-related foot ulcers).\n\nPeople who take immunosuppressants.\n\nPeople who need hemodialysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are osteomyelitis complications?\n\nOsteomyelitis complications can include:\n\nAbscesses: Bone infections can cause pockets of pus that break through your skin. Treatment to drain these abscesses may slightly increase your risk of skin cancer.\n\nOsteonecrosis: Osteonecrosis (bone death) can happen if swelling from the infection cuts off blood flow to your bone. It’s very rare, but some people with osteonecrosis need an amputation.\n\nSlowed growth: Osteomyelitis can cause children’s bones to grow and develop slower than usual.\n\nHow is osteomyelitis cured?\n\nYour provider will suggest treatments to kill the infection and prevent permanent bone damage. The most common osteomyelitis treatments include:\n\nAntibiotics: You’ll need antibiotics to cure a bacterial infection. You may need intravenous (IV) antibiotics for a few weeks before taking oral (pills you take by mouth) antibiotics for several weeks afterward.\n\nAntifungals: Antifungals treat fungal infections. You’ll probably need oral antifungal medications for several months.\n\nOver-the-counter pain relievers: Over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs or acetaminophen relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Your provider will tell you which kind of anti-inflammatory medicine is best for you, and how often it’s safe to take it.\n\nNeedle aspiration: Your healthcare provider may use a needle to drain pus or fluid from any abscesses that develop.\n\nSurgery: You may need surgery if the bone infection is severe or you have a high risk of complications. It’s more common to need surgery if you have vertebral osteomyelitis.\n\nHow soon after treatment will I feel better?\n\nIt can take a long time for osteomyelitis to heal. You might need antibiotics or antifungals for a few months. You should start feeling better as medications start killing the infection and slowing its spread.\n\nAsk your provider how long you’ll need to take antibiotics or antifungals. Make sure you take the full dose they prescribe for as long as they say, even if you start feeling better.\n\nHow do I take care of myself?\n\nMake sure you take the full course of your antibiotic or antifungal medication exactly as your provider prescribes. You need to finish the full dose, even if you feel better. If you stop taking your medications before you should, there’s a chance they won’t completely kill the infection. This increases your risk of chronic osteomyelitis and other complications.\n\nAsk your surgeon how to keep incisions clean after surgery. They’ll tell you when it’s safe to shower or bathe, how to clean your surgical site and which kind of soap is best to use on it.\n\nContact your healthcare provider or surgeon right away if you notice signs of an infection, especially at a surgery site.\n\nWhen should I see my healthcare provider?\n\nContact your provider or surgeon right away if you notice signs of an infection, especially if you notice pus or discharge at a wound or surgery site.\n\nWhich questions should I ask my provider?\n\nYou may want to ask your provider:\n\nWhich type of osteomyelitis do I have?\n\nWhat caused the bone infection?\n\nWhich treatments will I need?\n\nHow long should I take antibacterial or antifungals?\n\nWhat are the best ways to keep my surgery site or wounds clean to prevent infections?\n\nHow serious is osteomyelitis?\n\nOsteomyelitis is a serious condition that needs treatment right away. It usually responds very well to treatment, but you need to start treating it as soon as possible to prevent serious complications.\n\nOnce a provider diagnoses the infection and you start treatment, try not to worry. It might take a while to cure the infection, but the most important part is catching osteomyelitis early.\n\nDoes osteomyelitis go away on its own?\n\nNo, osteomyelitis won’t go away on its own. It’s extremely important to see a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and treatment. Your immune system does an amazing job of fighting off germs and other invaders, but you need antibiotics or antifungals to kill the infections that cause osteomyelitis.\n\nNever ignore signs of infection around a wound, especially if you just had surgery. Contact your provider or surgeon right away if you notice any changes in your incisions. It’s always better to ask too many questions than not enough. Trust your instincts — if something doesn’t look or feel right, it’s worth checking out.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nOsteomyelitis is a bone infection that happens when bacterial or fungal infections spread from other parts of your body into your bone marrow. It can be very serious and cause permanent bone damage, but it’s very manageable if you start treatment within a few days. Contact a healthcare provider right away if you notice signs of infection like a feeling of warmth, pus or discharge or if you have a fever.\n\nIt’s especially important to keep your incisions clean after having surgery. Your surgeon will give you specific instructions on how to keep your surgery site clean. Don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions. Your providers are there to help you stay safe and healthy; they won’t be upset to explain things in a different way or show you exactly what you need to do."
