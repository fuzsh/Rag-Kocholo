Humble Correspondent) in this website. This was not done to confuse, but rather to help shorten the text. (Which, at longer than three quarters of a million words, needed all the shortening it could get!) While researching and writing this book/website, I rather rapidly noticed that a lot of characters were duplicates of each other in all but name, and easily fit into one archetypal category. Wise-cracking hardboiled detectives, for example, were numerous, and to be honest fairly interchangeable with each other. So I slapped the label \"Bellem\" on this character type, as an homage to Robert Leslie Bellem, whose Dan Turner is the paradigmatic example of the type. I found that if I did this with all the interchangeable characters, it saved me a lot of typing. Of course, doing that runs the risk of confusing the reader, which is why this page is here: so when I call someone an Afghani Fighter or speak of SCIENCE! you'll know what I mean.\n\nThat wasn't enough, of course; I wanted to include in this list every example of the character types appearing anywhere in the Encyclopedia. So I'm including here every Brain in a Jar villain and every Lost Race a protagonist encounters; they are included here in parentheses, so that, under the Brain in a Jar entry, they are listed as (for example) Olaf K. Abelsen (misc.).\n\nAfghani Figher | Africa Hand | Armchair Detective | Bellem | Big-Headed Dwarf Genius | Brain in a Jar | Cape-and-Epee Hero | Celebrity Pulp | Con Man | CONQUER THE WORLD! | Costumed Avenger | Cowboy | Disabled Detective | Evil Surgeon | Femme Fatale | Fop | Gentleman Bandit | Great Detective | Gun Moll | Hobo | Jungle Hero | Killer Vigilante | Legionnaire | Lost Race | Loving Enemy | Lupin | Mad Scientist | Nuxia/Wuxia | Occult Detective | Planetary Romance Hero | Prehistoric Adventurer | Primates | Protagonists of Color | Rootless Veteran | SCIENCE! | Scientific Detective | South Seas Adventurer | Spinster Detective | Superhuman | Tall Tale Teller | Unlucky Inventor | Wanted Man | What's All This, Then | White Peril | Yellow Peril\n\nAfghani Fighter. A certain kind of pulp story, always set in the North-West Frontier--the area of land between Afghanistan and what is now Pakistan--features a recurring type of protagonist, what I’m calling the Afghani Fighter. These men--based on a handful of real people--are always agents of British Intelligence, and wander in disguise among the locals gathering intelligence. They are always outnumbered and outgunned and have only a loyal native sidekick and possibly a handful of British and Indian troops to pit against the enemies of Great Britain. And their enemies are always powerful threats to the stability of the British Empire: Russian spies or local Napoleons allying with hostile Pashtun tribes to invade and conquer India. The Wolf of Kabul is the archetypal Afghani Fighter.\n\nSteel Callaghan, Derek Carrington, Michael Garvie, Victor Gaunt, Colin Gray, Major Hazelrigg, John Rawlinson, Bart Shane, Bugs Sinnat, Aurelius Smith, Thorne, Timber Sahib, Wolf of Kabul\n\nAfrica Hand. Great Britain’s colonies in Africa were many and varied, and each colony was ruled by a Governor, with District Commissioners ruling individual sections. Each Commissioner’s district could be thousands or even tens of thousands of square miles in area, and the Commissioner was assisted by only a handful of white officials and a few squadrons of (non-white) soldiers. These officials were expected to enforce local and Imperial laws, collect taxes, prevent international crimes (like slave-trading), and above all prevent any conflict, between local peoples or between nations. In fiction, these officials were Africa Hands: experienced veterans of Foreign Service in Africa; intimately familiar not just with flora, fauna, and native cultures of Africa; deeply patriotic; and convinced that colonialism is the best thing for the natives—that British “civilization” can and will create a kind of moral uplift on the natives. To help this uplift and the peace and success of the Empire, the Africa Hands are willing to commit a wide range of acts, whipping natives for disrespecting a white man or hanging a corrupt native king without hesitation. Africa Hands have a great deal of respect for Africans, but in the same way that a hunter respects a lion—for its ferocity and power, but not as an equal. Curiously, most Africa Hands are Britons active in the jungles of West Africa, where Great Britain had no colonies. Sanders is the archetypal Africa Hand.\n\nGeoffrey Aylett\n\nBatouk (misc.)\n\nTrader Carson, Captain Christmas\n\nDynamite Drury\n\nIron Egan\n\nFive Courageous Frenchmen\n\nCrispin Gaunt, Denzil Grigson\n\nHusky Hillier\n\nLobangu (Sir Richard Loseley), Bruce Logan\n\nThe Major\n\nNick Norton\n\nKenneth O'Brien, Old Ebbie (Captain Hicks)\n\nPeace Officer, Prempeh (Barry Carson)\n\nAllan Quatermain\n\nSanders, Jim Scott, Ned Shackleton, Swamba (Roddy Clarke), Swopper Bob (Trader Bone), Commissioner Sykes\n\nTigre (Deputy-Commissioner Jim Stewart), Claus Timm, Rolf Torring (crooked British), Trooper Useless, Tim Tyler (white settlers)\n\nYika Trio\n\nArmchair Detective. The Armchair Detective is a man (rarely a woman) who is sufficiently brilliant that he can solve crimes from the comfort of his armchair, without doing any on-site research or depending only on an assistant to do the research for him. There were Armchair Detectives before the character type's archetype, the Old Man in the Corner. Arguably Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin was an Armchair Detective. Closer to the Pulp Age were Armchair Detectives like Paul Feval's John Temple (from Jean Diable (1862)). Certainly through most of the 19th century, when a real-life gentleman amateur detective would have had to do his deducting in the privacy of his own flat or home and when Poe was the dominant writer of detective and mystery fiction, the imaginative horizons of writers was limited to the Armchair Detective archetype. But the Old Man in the Corner really started the craze (such as it was) for fictional Armchair Detectives, and those Armchair Detectives who followed the Old Man were influenced by him to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nInspector Allhoff, Oliver Armiston, Disher, Dr. Duque, Joseph Leborgne, Nelson Lee, Linley, Old Man in the Corner, Don Isidro Parodi, George Washington Troxell, Kristian White, Nero Wolfe\n\nBellem. The hard-boiled, cynical private detective is a pervasive pulp archetype, beginning at least with Race Williams, although the archetype’s roots lie in the English casebooks of the mid-19th century, which is where the hardboiled character type really originated. But the wise-cracking, two-fisted, hardboiled, hard-drinking, womanizing cynical crime-solver, usually but not always a private detective--the kind of character who is as quick with a quip as with his fists--is a character type that emerged in the pulps only in the 1930s, although it became a cliché within a few years. The hardboiled characters of the 1920s were cynical, two-fisted, hard-drinking, and womanizing, but they were emphatically not wise-cracking and generally lacked the sort of existential joie de vivre that Bellems have. The greatest of Bellems was Dan Turner, he of “a roscoe coughed Ka-Chow.” In honor of Dan Turner's creator, the prolific pulpster Robert Leslie Bellem, I’ve dubbed this character type the Bellem.\n\nGalahad Baxter, Steve Borden, Mr. Bowles, Homer Bull (Macandrews), Chan Buzzell\n\nKiller Cain, Carmady, Johnny Carr, Bill Carter, Johnny Cass, Johnny Castle, Peter Chance, Dr. Chung (Mr. Bacht), Daniel Cluer, Shean Connell, Crawley Cool, Danny Coyle (Harvard Donovan), Cliff Cragin, Bill Crane, Alphabet Crisp\n\nKen Daly, John Dalmas, Dion Davies, Bill Disley, Johnny Dolan, Donny Donahue, Edward D'Strange, Joseph Dugan\n\nAllen Foster\n\nScoop Griddle, Alfred Gusman\n\nBacchus Hallahan, Johnny Harding, Daniel Harwin, Clay Holt, Little Jack Horner, Mark Hull, Tony Hunter\n\nBen Jardinn, Jarnegan, Dan Jordan, Jack Jordan\n\nGerry Kells, Mugs Kelly, Tony Key, George Killeen, K-67\n\nKip Lacey, Bob Larkin, Simon Lash, Bill Lennox\n\nDick Marlow, Philip Marlowe, Anthony Martin, No-Shirt McGee, Captain McGrail, Jack McGuire, Mariano Mercado, Matt Mercer, Lafayette Muldoon\n\nIzzy O'Shea\n\nBill Peepe, Casey Peters, Miss Pinkerton, Duke Pizzatello\n\nEd Race, Nick Ransom, Richard Rogue, Nick Rongetti, Kiriti Roy,\n\nShag & Bones, Ben Shaley, Ben Slabbe, Tim Sloan, John Steel\n\nPete Taylor, Pat Thompson, Peter Trapp the Second, Joe Trimo, Dan Turner\n\nSam Vedder\n\nPercy Warren\n\nBig-Headed Dwarf Genius. A classic trope of popular literature, going back at least to the Gothics if not to the Egyptian and Olmec myths, is the evil dwarf—that is, a literal dwarf, rather than some fairy tale creature—whose wicked brilliance is so overwhelming that, in a prime example of the symbolic-made-literal, his head is enormous. Before the 19th century, the dwarf used magic or a more mundane form of evil to work his ends, but beginning in the mid-19th century the dwarf began to use technology, usually advanced or even forbidden technology, as a weapon against heroic men and women. In the 20th century, the dwarf became a form of the Mad Scientist, usually the villain of a story but occasionally a protagonist in search of redemption. There's not really an archetypal Big-Headed Dwarf Genius--none of them really struck enough of a chord with other writers and with the pubic to become iconic--but most of the ones listed below are good examples of the character type.\n\nAtalanta (Lemurian albinos)\n\nNarcisse Barbidon (Martians), Reginald Blake, Professor Brandon (aliens), Ivan Brodsky, Harry Brunton (the Conquerors)\n\nJonas Fjeld (Ilmari Erko)\n\nDr. Hackensaw (future humans)\n\nJed (the Masters)\n\nKonserson (children), Professor Kurganov\n\nBrutus Lloyd, Everson Lumley (Dr. Alonzo Kelpie)\n\nTommy Malins (misc.), Gaston Max (Anubis), Baron Montavo (Hollow Earth representatives), Doctor Munsker\n\nNano 48, Jack Nelson (Ta Clo)\n\nNeils Orsen\n\nNat Pinkerton (Li Lo Tsching)\n\nJoel Quaite (humanity)\n\nVernon Walsh (Pelathon, Si-Lafnor), Don Winslow (the Dwarf)\n\nBrain in a Jar. The Brain in a Jar—the living brain (usually disembodied), floating in a jar of fluid, still sentient and somehow communicating with the outside world—is a classic trope of science fiction and horror films and pulps. The version most readers are familiar with is 20th century version, but the predecessor of the Brain in a Jar can be said to have been the Cumaean Sibyl, who in Petronius’ Satyricon is a withered body, cursed with immortality but no youth, who is seen in a hanging jar. The Brain in a Jar character type didn't really emerge until the 20th century, when science fiction and horror films and the pulps, with their incessant demand for new material, combined to influence writers of fantastika to create the Brain in a Jar. If there can be said to be an archetypal Brain in a Jar, it's Richard Donovan, but he came relatively late, well after other Brains in a Jar had appeared.\n\nOlaf K. Abelsen (misc.), Brain, Captain Future (Simon), Hawk Carse (misc.), Charlie Chan (misc.), Robert Darvel (Great Brain of Mars), Richard Donovan, Ethan Drew (Wise One), Harald Harst (misc.), Nez Hulan (misc.), Jed, Professor Kern (Dowell), The Man with Two Heads, Mark Nevin (Russians), Vincent Renolf (misc.), Tom Shark (Caligula), Dan Williams (masters of Unidom), Wing Loo (students)\n\nCape-and-Épée Hero. Cap et épée, or “cape and épée,” is the traditional term in French literary criticism for novels of the Three Musketeers sort, in which the swashbuckling heroes wear capes and fight with rapiers in Europe during the 17th century. Dumas had his predecessors in European fiction--hell, the Spanish loved cap et épée fiction for two centuries before the French really took to it--but The Three Musketeers and its sequels were so popular and influential that they became the archetypal cap et épée novels, with the titular characters (plus D'Artagnan) becoming iconic. Twentieth century Cap et épée stories and heroes are inarguably in the shadow of Dumas, and are generally happy to be there--nearly a century and a half after The Three Musketeers first appeared, the influence of Dumas is still strong enough to help sell stories and novels based on his work.\n\nAthos, Porthos & Aramis, Black Mask (II), Boy Musketeers, Captain Lucifer, Captain Sin Miedo, Carot, Cleve & d'Entreville, The Courier, The Dagger, Comte de Chavagnac, Estelle de Lys, M. de Mintard, Five Invincibles, Florian, Four Spaniards, Ghost Duke (I), Ghost Duke (II), Captain La Chesnaye, Messenger (II), Montbars (V), Musketeer of the Sea, Musketeers, Pardaillan, Raul (I), Red Cape, Santana, Three Cat Musketeers, Three Crusaders\n\nCelebrity Pulp. Pulps or novels or texts whose protagonists are real-life, living celebrities (Charlie Chaplin, for example) portrayed as having very fictional adventures. The trend predates the pulps, of course; fanfiction is an old tradition, and by the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when modern celebrity culture really began, celebrity fan fiction (about Lord Byron, for example) was a going concern. The Celebrity Pulps are merely the pulp version of that type of fanfiction.\n\nCliff Aeros, Luciano Albertini, Carlo Aldini, Evno Azef\n\nClyde Beatty, Frank Buck (I), Frank Buck (II), Buffalo Bill\n\nAl Capone (I), Al Capone (II), Charlot, Jackie Coogan (I), Jackie Coogan (II)\n\nWilliam Duncan\n\nThomas Alva Edison\n\nFanfan\n\nFather Gapon, Gomecillo & Peliculez\n\nHarry Hill, Harry Houdini\n\nJack the Ripper (I), Jack the Ripper (II), Jampulinkam, Billy Jenkins, Buck Jones\n\nLampiao, Gypsy Rose Lee, Elmo Lincoln, Max Linder, Harold Lloyd\n\nNestor Makhno, Georges Manolescu, Jimmy Mattern, Ken Maynard (I), Ken Maynard (II), Patjar Merah, Mistinguett, Tom Mix (I), Tom Mix (II), Tom Mix (III), Tom Mix (IV), Tom Mix (V), Tom Mix (VI), Antonio Moreno, Jack Mylong\n\nPola Negri, Harold Noice\n\nOka-Yuma, Ossi Oswalda\n\nLee Parry, Joe Petrosino, Edmond Pezon, Harry Piel, Eddy Polo (I), Eddy Polo (II), Eddy Polo (III), Eddy Polo (IV), I.D. Putilin\n\nWill Rogers\n\nShi Jianqiao, Antonio Silvino, Sonya, Savanyu Soska, Hans Stosch-Sarrasani\n\nTref, Roscoe Turner\n\nMadame Verbitskaia, Villiod\n\nCon Man. One of the more popular character types in the pulps, the Con Man or Swindler was usually (but not always) portrayed as having a sentimental side and as willing to help those who are being victimized, and to prey on other criminals. Those who were not were usually too incompetent to succeed at their chosen profession.\n\nDoctor Alcazar, Astro the Seer\n\nOtis Beagle, Beggars' Club, Paul Beggarstaff, Ostap Bender, Natasha Blackwell, Blue Sky Company, One Eye Brannigan, Jabez Bunker, Smiler Bunn, Otto Burlingame\n\nChucho el Roto, Amos Clackworthy, Baltimore Criddle, Danby Croker\n\nThe Dean, Doc Comanche, Dandy Dyson\n\nEasy Street Experts, Elegant Edward, Buttons Evans\n\nJimGrim (Chullunder Ghose)\n\nLefty Feep, Jeremiah Finch, Colonel Humphrey Flack, Johnny Fletcher, Art Furber, Elmer Furbush\n\nGog, Guy & Ghost\n\nMr. Holeman, Honest John\n\nGeorge H.

Just like Primates, few things so embody the pulps so much as the over-the-top Mad Scientist (see below) or (usually Germanic) tyrant who delivers a speech—to a monstrous henchmen, to fanatical troops, or to a bound and helpless enemy, usually the hero of the story—in which the villain finishes with “und zen ve vill CONQUER ZE VURLD!” Sadly, most of these characters failed, few had much success at all or, to be honest, were a great deal of fun to read about, and only a handful had the spark of gleeful, joyous wickedness that sets the immortal villains apart from the ordinary bad guys. But even the dullest of these would-be world conquerers has at least one moment which will reward the reader.\n\nAir Master, Frank Allan (misc.), Amarbal, Dusty Ayres (Fire-Eyes)\n\nNapoleon Berg, Blue Hawk (misc.), Harry Brunton (the Conquerors)\n\nCaptain Justice (Marcus the Mysterious), Nick Carter (I) (Bolivian Amazons), Cecil of Cornwall (Abbe), Deepak Chatterjee (misc.), Connie (Lakhpor), Copperhead (Doctor Satan)\n\nJack Darrell (alien slugs), Professor Demonico, Don Dixon (Dr. Strunski), Doctor Death\n\nEl Fantasma (Man With No Head)\n\nGarin, Bruce Gentry (misc.), Golden Amazon, Walter Goodwin (evil Murians), Professor Grant (Matapal)\n\nColin Haig (Mme.

This category includes any character who wears a recognizable and consistent costume while fighting crime or evil. For the purposes of this encyclopedia, “costume” does not necessarily have to be a colorful superhero-style “pervert suit,” to use Warren Ellis’ phrase, but can be simply the same mask or the same set of similarly-colored clothing. Because of this somewhat broad criteria, there are characters included in this list, like the masked cowboy characters, who are not ordinarily thought of as being Costumed Avengers. But in a book like this it is better to be overly inclusive than not enough so.\n\nAce of Spades (I), Ace of Spades (II), El Alacrán, Furio Almirante, Angel (II), Armored Man, Audreses\n\nThe Bat (II), Beati Paoli, Black (III), Black Ace, Black Bandit, Black Bat (II), Black Cloak, Black Diamond, Black Eagle, Black Falcon, Black Hood, Black Jack, Black Knight (II), Black Mask (I) (antagonist), Black Mask (II), Black Mask (III), Black Moth, Black Pilgrim, Black Rider, Black Sapper, Black Whip, Blue Man, Carlos & Marcos Bon, Pelham Bond, Burmese Swordsman\n\nEl Caballero, Caballero X, Bob Calem, Capitan Antorcha, Capitan Coraje, Capitan Misterio, Captain Midnight, Captain Mors, Captain Nighthawk, Captain Storm, Cat's Eye, Charro Negro (I), Charro Negro (II), Chucho el Roto, Ciclone, Cobra (II), Red Colt, Copperhead, Corsair X, Cossack, Coyote, Crimson Clown, Crimson Mask, Cruz Diablo, Jim Curry, Cyklon Kid\n\nDaring Damsel, Estelle de Lys, Deccan Queen, Desert Phantom, Detective Nobody, Doctor Coffin, Domino Lady\n\nThe Eagle (I), The Eagle (II), Mr. Enigma, El Espectro\n\nEl Fantasma, Flaming Avenger, Flying Justice, Miss Fury\n\nGalator, Garibaldi, Ghost (I), Ghost Duke (II), Golden Mask, Green Ghost, Green Hornet, Green Lama, Griffon\n\nEl Halcon de Acero, Hansa, Hawk (II), El Hidalgo, Hind Kesari, Fred Hood (Carolina, the \"Fury of the Manitu\"), Hunterwali\n\nIndian Superhero, Invisible Robinhood\n\nJack-a-Lantern, Japanese Mad Scientist (scientist's enemy), Judex\n\nKarga, King of Diamonds, William King, Kurama Tengu\n\nLady Luck, Laughing Mask, Leatherface (I), Leatherface (II), Leatherface (III), Lion Man (I), Lion Man (II), Lone Ranger\n\nMagician (II), The Man in Purple, The Man in the Motor Mask, The Man in the Red Mask, The Man in the Silver Mask, Mas-Ley, The Mask, Masked Cavalier, Masked Detective, Masked Marvel, Masked Phantom, Masked Rider (I), Masked Rider (II), Masked Terror, Masked Warrior, Minnalkodi, Mister Death (I), Mr. Mystic, Mister Nobody (II), Mohan, Moker, The Mongoose, Monk of Ironstone Prison, Moon Man, El Murcielago\n\nNameless Knight, Jack Nelson, Ninja Boy, Ninja Woman\n\nOgon Batto, Pat O'Maley\n\nPark Avenue Hunt Club, Patent Leather Kid, Patsy (Phantom Magician), Phantom (II), Phantom (III), Phantom Detective, Phantom Rider, Phantom Sheriff, Phantom Thief (II), Phantom X, Prince of Gamma, Luis Punales, Purple Hood, Purple Scar\n\nEl Rajo, Rakshita, Ravenhill, Red Archer, Red Eagle, Red Lady, Red Rose, Red Shadow, Redmask, Riddle Rider\n\nScorpion (I), Senor Red Mask, Senorita Scorpion, The Shadow (II), Sigono, Silver Buck, Skulls of Terror, Spider (II), Spider Man, Spirit, Spring-Heeled Jack\n\nThree Vigilantes, Thunderbolt (I), Thunderbolt (II), Two Pistols\n\nUnknown Ally\n\nVanishing Rider, Vantolio, El Vengador, Villiod\n\nMack Wan, Whirlwind, The Whisperer, Whispering Monk, Bob Wilson\n\nX (II)\n\nYi Zhimei, Yorga, Yuma\n\nZigomar (III), Zigomar (IV), Zorro\n\nCowboy. For the purposes of this category any character adventuring in the western half of the United States during the 19th century and the first half of the twentieth century counts as a “cowboy.” A fair number of stories in the western pulps were set in the modern (i.e., 1920s or 1930s) era, and characters in those stories are included here. The rare cowboy active outside of the United States, like Pepe Cortes, is also included.\n\nAce of the Triple Diamond, Bullwhip Adams, Alabam, Alkali Ike, Lefty Allen, Bar-Nothing Red Ames, Anita,

Traditionally, in the pulps and in criticism of the pulps, the phrase “defective detective” was used to describe the disabled or maimed characters, like Seekay, whose vogue in the pulps was a brief but intense one. Being disabled (or “defective” in the insensitive, inaccurate, and offensive parlance of the time) was what set them apart from other characters. For the purposes of this encyclopedia, blind characters, like Max Carrados, are included in this category. Generally blind characters are written and treated differently than the other \"disabled detectives,\" but in the interests of space-saving they are included here.\n\nInspector Allhoff, Ben Bryn, Max Carrados, Thornley Colton, Billy Dogg, Edward D'Strange, Joe Gee, Dan Holden, John Howden, Calvin Kane, Eddie Kelly, Patrick Laing, Larry Loman, Duncan Maclain, Malachi Manatee, Lin Melchan, Nat Perry, Queg, Peter Quest, Julian Renard, Seekay, Steve Silk, Nicholas Street, Tom, Dick, & Harry, Ted S.

The Evil Surgeon is primarily a violator of the human body, whether a crazed vivisector like Dr. Quartz or someone who merely wants to experiment on a living body, like Professor Barter.\n\nOlaf K.

The femme fatale, the beautiful and deadly woman who uses her beauty and/or sexuality to increase her power, has been a constant in Western culture, although the modern version of the femme fatale began appearing only in the second half of the 19th century. In the pulp context the femme fatale is a different character than the femme fatale of films noir or mainstream mystery fiction. The pulp femme fatale is more often a protagonist than a film noir or mystery femme fatale. And the pulp femme fatale is substantively different than either of the latter two. The film noir or mystery femme fatale uses sexuality as a weapon in order to get what she wants. Sex, for the film noir or mystery femme fatale, is one tool of many in the femme fatale’s toolbox, and if sleeping with a hero, villain, or patsy is what is needed to achieve her aims, the noir/mystery femme fatale will do just that. This is not the case with the pulp femme fatale, who is far more rarely sexually active. The pulp femme fatale promises much but rarely delivers, and meanwhile uses male characters’ desire for her to manipulate them.\n\nAdaptive Ultimate, AgentYZ7, El Alacran (misc.), Roberto Alcazar (misc.), Alraune, Antinéa, Aquilea, Ayesha\n\nJohn Baxter (the Demon Woman), Red Barry (The Flame), Max Beaumont (misc.), Black Mask (III) (misc.), Black Masks (Lydia), Natasha Blackwell, Sergeant Blair (misc., Belle la Tour), Hannibal Blunt (movie star), Rolf Brand (Lady in Black), Brenty (Aracnida), Albert Brien (misc.),\n\nHunt Canning (misc.), Le Capitaine (misc.), Captain Stinky (misc.), Bill Carter (misc.), Deepak Chatterjee (misc.), Kayla Cherroff, Chinese Gamine, Hein Class (Rita), Leon Clifton (Devil Woman), Clubs Detective (the Modern Salome), Colette (misc.), Anton Custer (Fedora, Eros Volusia)\n\nKurt Danner (the She-Scorpio), Daxo (misc.), Ray de Astur (Queen of Ceres), Detective Nobody (misc.), Tania Devereaux, Bill Disley (assassins), Fidelity Dove, Nita Duboin\n\nEva (II)\n\nFrank Faber (Anja), Princess Fantoche, Desiree Forestier, French Aviator (Helene, Countess de Falso), French Commissioner (The Countess)\n\nGees (misc.), Genuine, Martin Gisander (Jania Faralewski)\n\nColin Haig (Mme.

The classic detective Fop is Philo Vance, and most of the detective Fops were to a greater or lesser extent influenced by him. The vanity, the obsession with appearance, dress, and manners, the variety of affectations, the forced languor–they are all Vancean, but they arose from the pose of upper class British men of the 19th century. Of course, detective Fops aren’t really foppish, any more than Vance is. When there is danger to be confronted or a mystery to be solved, Vance et al. drop the foppish pose and become as capable as any Bellem.\n\nBlack Spider, Ascanio Bonichi, Benvenuto Brown, Marcus Buller, Albert Campion, Hugh Carding, Dave Clovelly, Arthur Augustus d'Arcy, Reginald de Puyster, Maxwell Fenner, Peter Graham, Maurice Hemyock, Ivy Lane, Francis Mandall-Essington, Yorke Norroy, Christopher Peale, Arthur Stukeley Pennington, Warren Powell, Beau Quicksilver, Enevold Rist, Terry Trimble, Philo Vance, Anthony Vereker\n\nGentleman Bandit.

To most fans of mysteries there is only one Great Detective: Sherlock Holmes. But the popularity of Sherlock Holmes was such that, like Arsène Lupin and the Lupin, Holmes was imitated around the world.

The Gun Moll—the female shootist who acts as sidekick and occasionally lover to a fictional villain—can be traced to the historical bandits which plagued Europe in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The bandits were almost usually male, but female members of their gangs were, while rare, not entirely unknown. As is usually the case with women in a traditionally male environment or profession, these women were forced to be tougher and more deadly than their male counterparts, purely to gain their respect. These women were duplicated in the popular fiction of various countries during these centuries, whether in ballads, broadsheets, or penny dreadfuls. More broadly, of course, these women were following in the path of previous historical women warriors, from the Amazons to Greek myth to the female armies of the Ashanti to the women samurai to the female revolutionaries of Russia and China in the 19th and 20th centuries. Nor was there a shortage of female criminals in most countries during the 1800s and 1900s whose crimes were violent and who used weapons with all the seriousness and skill of their male counterparts. The pulp writers were probably not aware of the specifics of this history, and probably would not have cared if they’d known. For them, the Gun Moll was an alluring symbolic combination of sex and violence, as perfectly a symbol of the Bad Girl for the pulps as the Femme Fatale.\n\nBuffalo Bill (Dell Dauntless)\n\nAl Capone (I) (Eveline), Queen Sue Carlton\n\nVelma Dare\n\nEl Fantasma (Vera)\n\nRhoda Gray\n\nHawk From Hell (Mickey)\n\nJimmie Lavender (misc.), Jack Lloyd (Sybil Craig)\n\nThe Madame, Dizzy Malone, M.

There have always been homeless wanderers, from the Romany (Gypsies) to the Vagabonds to the more modern Gentlemen of the Road. But the 1920s and especially the 1930s saw an enormous increase in the number of men and women who roamed across various countries. In the 1920s the usual population of wanderers was added to by the “new poor,” the men and women left jobless by the post-World War One recession, by the deaths of wage-earners in the 1918 flu pandemic, and by the general destruction to infrastructures and economies caused by World War One. In the 1930s, the global depression sent millions from their homes in search of work or simply a new place to farm or even to just start over. In reality, the lives of men and women who were forced to abandon their homes in search of work were harsh, desperate, and dangerous. Work was hard to come by, food almost as difficult to find and rarely nutritious or even safe, townspeople suspicious, police inimical, travel life-threatening, and a greater-than-average percentage of fellow wanderers criminal, violent, or mentally ill. Yet, curiously, the pulps seemed to find the Hobo an attractive character to portray in a heroic and adventurous light.\n\nBagdad, Bill & Jim, Bob & Bo, G-X, Giglamps, Highway, Honk & Horace, Jimmie Jackson, Kiki, King Charlie, Placido, Boxcar Reilly, Rob Saunders, Slim Jim, Tommy Thorne\n\nJungle Hero. Tarzan (I) was not the first fictional Jungle Hero. But, while there were a number of characters in fiction who were abandoned as children and grew up as feral children, usually in jungles and usually acquiring the skills of animals–Kipling’s Mowgli is foremost among this group–Tarzan was in most cases the standard on which successive iterations of the Jungle Hero was modeled.\n\nAngel (I), Angrad\n\nBlack Diamond (woman), Bomba (I), Bos'n Hal (Rip)\n\nHein Class (N'gui), Betty Castleton\n\nKurt Danner (Jungle Queen), Darwa, Daughter of the Jungle, Tabu Dick, Valerie Drew (misc.)\n\nFelifax\n\nDick Hatteras, Hero of the Wilds, Hurricane (misc.)\n\nJan of the Jungle, Polaris Janess, Jim of the Jungle, Genius Jones, Jongor, Jubal, Jungle Girl, Jungle King, Jungle Queen\n\nKa-Zar, Ketelbinkie (Zartan of the Monkeys), Ki-Gor, Kioga (I), Kioga (II), Kroom, Kulafu, Kwa of the Jungle\n\nJoan Lawrence, Lion Ruler of the Jungle, Lord of the Jungle, Lothel\n\nMala, Matalaa, Morgo the Mighty, M.

Since the 18th century Western adventure fiction has always privileged heroes who do not kill and who show mercy to their victims by allowing the legal system to punish them. The Western genre has the best formulation for the philosophy behind this: a hero fights barbarians, but sometimes a hero must use lethal force to fight barbarians–but in using lethal force, the hero becomes a barbarian. However, there have always been characters who chose murderous vengeance over socially sanctioned justice. The following is a list of these characters in the pulps. (This category does not include characters who are fighting in a war, since by definition they are soldiers or spies rather than vigilantes).\n\nPâwang Ali, Angel (II)\n\nBlack (III), Black Barr, Villiers Beethom-Saunders, Paul Bernard, Black Moth, Black Rider, Killer Blake, Guncat Bodman, Jim Buffalo, Ethan Burr\n\nJack Calhoun, Captain Mesquite, Nick Carter (I), Humphrey Challoner, Frank Clamart, Red Colt, Crimson Mask\n\nMonsieur de Paris, Death Angel, Dormouse, Drago\n\nDr. Flame\n\nGary Greer\n\nSatan Hall\n\nThe Judge, Just Men\n\nKarga\n\nMajor John T.

Characters in this category are members of the French Foreign Legion (rarely, the Spanish Foreign Legion), and their stories are about their actions fighting various evil North African (or, more unusually, Southeast Asian) peoples. The classic example of this sort of character is Beau Geste, from P.C. Wren’s Beau Geste.

The “Loving Enemy” is the opponent of a story’s protagonist who also has romantic feelings for the protagonist, and who the protagonist is attracted to. But because the Loving Enemy is an enemy, the Loving Enemy and the protagonist cannot be together. In many (though not all) cases the pair are united in love by the end of the story, serial, or series. The quintessential Loving Enemy is Sexton Blake’s Mademoiselle Yvonne de Cartier, who would have been Blake’s wife if not for her criminal ways.

A Lupin is a man (usually) of Society, of good breeding and good manners, who enriches himself, or simply earns his daily wage, through crime, all while carrying himself in a high style and dressing in the most au courant fashion. What separates the Lupin from the ordinary master thief is the joie de vivre with which the Lupin carries himself, and the taunting relationship he maintains with police. (This is why Zenith the Albino is not a Lupin: Zenith is filled with weltschmertz, not joy). The Lupin, like the Bellem and the Great Detective, is named after the archetypal example of the character form: Maurice Leblanc’s Arsène Lupin. Arsène Lupin was not the first Lupin. One can argue that the historical gentleman bandits of the 17th century were Lupins avant la lettre, and Lupin fiction began with Grant Allen’s Colonel Clay (1896-1897). Some partisans will continue to maintain that A.J. Raffles is the quintessential gentleman thief. But Arsène Lupin is a more memorable character, as well as being better written, and ultimately it was Lupin rather than Raffles who better embodied the character type and was more influential on other characters.\n\nHeywood Achison, John Ainsley, Alaska-Jim (Silken Jimmy), Frank Allan (J.

A wüxia is a wandering Chinese knight errant, with nüxia being the female version. There were historical wüxia, emerging during the chaos of the Warring States period (403-221 B.C.E.), and protecting the weak and oppressed against the powerful and unjust. Wüxia appear in the historical record through the centuries and dynasties, only disappearing during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911 C.E.). In Chinese fiction the nüxia and wüxia are as common, and symbolically potent, as the cowboy is in Western fiction. The nüxia/wüxia is a highly skilled warrior and martial artist. Often (though not always) their mastery of qi has allowed them to “fly over eaves and walk on walls,” hence the description of wüxia as “flying swordsmen.” Martial artists who lack these superhuman skills are not included in this category.\n\nBai Suying, Judge Bao (assistants), Black Cloak, Black Peony\n\nChang Mei (assistants)\n\nFang Yuqin, Fei Long, Feng, Five Nuxia, Flying Swallow, Flying Tiger, Fong Sai Yuk\n\nGuan Xiugu, Gui Wu (I), Gui Wu (II)\n\nHe Yufeng, Hero of the Air, Hong Xiaoyuan, Huo Yuanjia\n\nJiangnan Swordswoman, Jigong (friends)\n\nKam Fung Chi, Kunlun Monks\n\nLady in Red, Li Ch’ih-chün (misc.), Li Feifei, Li Mu Bai, Long Menghua (misc.), Louw Tjheng Tie, Aunt Lu\n\nMa Yongzhen, Magic Eye, Mistress of the Spear\n\nNameless Hero\n\nJudge Peng (assistants), Pirate Queen (I)\n\nRed Beauty (misc.), Red Butterfly, Red Lady, Rural Swordsman\n\nSam-neung, Seven Monks, Judge Shi (misc.), Shi Jianqiao\n\nTwo Swords Nuxia\n\nWang Brothers, Wang Daolong, White Swallow\n\nYang Yuchun, Yi Zhimei, Yun Mei\n\nZhan Mubai, Zhao Lin (misc.),\n\nOccult Detective. Occult detectives are those investigators, usually gentlemen amateurs rather than professionals, who specialize in cases involving the supernatural. Although the occult detective first appeared in the 19th century–the character usually described as the first major occult detective is J.S. Le Fanu’s Doctor Hesselius (1869-1872)–it was in the 20th century, and in pulp fiction, that the occult detective became a distinctive character type.\n\nPierre d'Artois\n\nBaroda, Luna Bartendale, Ivan Brodsky\n\nThomas Carnacki, Lucian Carolus, Francis Chard, Rex Cole, Jr., Cranshawe, Sheila Crerar\n\nDr. Danton, Jeffery Darke, Jules de Grandin, Dr. Elias de Jong, Sar Dubnotal, Doctor Dyn\n\nGees\n\nHarrison\n\nSimon Iff, Phileas Immanuel\n\nKaramahati, Dr. Karnac, Moris Klaw, Kram\n\nMichael Leigh, Dr. James Livingstone\n\nDr. Martinus, Mascar the Mystic, John Meredith, Mesmer Milann, Minx, Mister X, Doctor Muncing\n\nNeils Orsen\n\nMiles Pennoyer, Psychic Detective, Hugh Docre Purcell, Judge Keith Hilary Pursuivant\n\nSebastian Quin\n\nProfessor Raveleigh, Ravenwood, Arnold Rhymer, Jens Rolf\n\nDerek Scarfe, Semi-Dual, Mark Shadow, Doctor Silence\n\nDr. Taverner\n\nGodfrey Usher\n\nAylmer Vance, Teddy Verano, Rene Vergnaud, Norton Vyse\n\nScarsdale Waring, Pick Winkler, Dr. Xavier Wycherley\n\nZhong Kui\n\nPlanetary Romance Hero. A planetary romance can be defined as a romance (in the traditional sense) in which a human in the modern day travels to another planet or moon and has an adventure there, in much the same way that wanderers in more traditional folktales went into Faerie, adventured there, and returned home. (In a sense Peter Pan can be seen as a kind of Planetary Romance Hero). As used in this encyclopedia, it refers specifically to characters who go from Earth to only one planet during the story, rather than touring the solar system, which is why Mr. Absurdity is not a Planetary Romance Hero, tempting though it was to include him here.

A half-truth that persists in popular and academic discourse about the pulps is that they were an all-white affair, with no people of color shown in them. To a limited degree this is true: certainly many pulps were deeply whitewashed. But as mentioned in my On Racism piece, there were a surprising number of POC characters in a large number of pulps--non-stereotypical POCs, the ones written to be as free of negative stereotypes as the writers could manage. In this the pulps were the superior of their more mainstream contemporaries, who usually never bothered to show POC at all, or did so in the most limited and racist of ways.\n\nThe following list--by no means exhaustive--is intended to show the range of Protagonists of Color in the pulps--by which mean all the pulp protagonists & all of their their sidekicks (and the pulp antagonists who have their own entry in this encyclopedia) who aren't considered white by white American society's current (extremely screwed-up) standards. So peoples from the northern coast of the Mediterranean are considered \"white\" and peoples from the eastern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean are not, despite the historical mixing of the two.\n\n(Unfortunately, a number of the characters included in this list are racist stereotypes. That, too, was the nature of the pulps, and denying it does nobody any good).\n\nYayne Ababa, Abadahalla-Fan, Mr. Absurdity, Mr. Abukir, Ace of Spades (I), Adelita, Agent YZ7, Tsang Ah-bou, Air Bandit, El Alacran, Alaska Jim (Old Crow), Hassam Ali, Pawang Ali, Frank Allan (Sam), Amarbal, Amat, Mynheer Amayat, Ishmael Ameer, Aminah, Anantcin, Angel (I), Angrad, Jim Anthony, Antinea, Apache & Wagonwheel (Apache), Apaches (II), Arita Ryuzo, Colonel Robert Lee Ashley (Shag), Avenger (II) (Josh & Rosabel Newton), Ayesha, Aztoc\n\nMiss B, Sundar Babu, Bahama Bill, Bai Suying, Byomkesh Bakshi, Judge Bao, Bara, Inspector Barkatullah, Baroda, Bimbashi Baruk, Abdulkasim Basri, Teofilo Batanes, Batouk, Johannes Baumgart, Dr. Belsidus, Yusuf ben Yakoud, Bengali Inspector, Kishkish Bey, Big Chief Wahoo, Big Head Detective, Bill (Chon), Bimal, Biogeno (Ortiz), Black Abbot, Black Bandit, Black Cat, Black Cheetah, Black Cloak, Black Dragon, Black Horse, Black Knight (I), Black Mask (I), Black Peony, Monsieur Blackshirt, Bloody Hand, Blue Blaze (Eagle-Eye), Blue Hawk (Sheba), Blue Man, Blue Pete, Bokulmoon, Bomba (II), Napoleon Bonaparte, Border Bandit (misc.), Arindam Bosu, Botak, Leo Brandhorst, Bugwine Breck, Yu Bu-ran, Buffalo Bill (Lung Hi, misc. native friends), Burmese Swordsman, Ethan Burr (Sam Ming)\n\nCagayous, Steel Callaghan (Khan Sahib Yusuf Latif), Ethel Calvert (Dr. Oshida), Lightnin' Calvert (misc.), Roman Calvo, Campu, Cankarlal, Capitan Misterio (Pancho), Captain Mors (misc. crewmen), Captain Storm (Muley el-Kadel), Tom Cardiff (misc.

The global economy underwent a recession following World War One. Such things usually happen after wars—wartime economies shift to peace economies, returning soldiers swell the ranks of the unemployed, and so on—but the war had badly damaged the industries and infrastructure of the European countries, caused countries to borrow money to pay for the war effort (which led to inflation), wiped out a significant percentage of the labor force, caused countries to incur large war debts, and removed the Russian market entirely. The post-WW1 recession lasted until the mid-1920s in Europe.\n\nBecause of this recession, many soldiers newly returned home were unable to find work and became the “New Poor.” Beyond their poverty and inability to get a job, they also suffered from a disconnection from society and a perceived lack of purpose or place. In reality many of these joined politically activist organizations, left-wing, right-wing, pacifist, or (in the United States in the early 1930s) the Bonus Army. In fiction, these soldiers, the Rootless Veterans, became adventurers, master thieves, and vigilantes. Unlike most of the other categories in this appendix, the Rootless Veteran is usually only the starting point for the character, rather than the eventual destination. (Demobbed veterans who return to the comfortable lifestyle they had before the war, like Colonel Cloudsdale and Victor Caryll, are not included here).\n\nTommy & Tuppence Beresford, Brigand, Wireless Bryce, James Clarkson-Perry, Jimmie Cordie, Harry Dangerfield, John Davies, Clive Dorry, Bulldog Drummond, Gang-Smasher, Peter Kerrigan, Major John T.

This category is broadly defined as including any human being who has abilities which are impossible in our world, from various psychic abilities to greater-than-human physical abilities to magic powers. This category does not include individuals who rely on tools or weapons to grant them superhuman abilities. (Which is why Kimball Kinnison is not here). Casual observers of the pulps have traditionally been under the impression that a large number of pulp characters were superhuman, while certain pulp aficionados have stridently denied that any pulp characters had superpowers.
