        "text": "The first recording today starts with the end of Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks.\n\nThere’s a trail for TMI.\n\nThen, another episode of Pinky and the Brain. This one has a couple of stories. First is A Meticulous Analysis of History which is just an excuse for Brain to do a parody of the Gilbert and Sullivan “Modern Major General” patter song. Great fun, though.\n\nThe next episode is Funny You Don’t Look Rhennish in which Pinky and The Brain want to find a mineral called Sinusite which they can use to make sneezing powder. But the biggest source of the mineral is under land owned by the Rhennish people, who sound suspiciously like the Amish. I like the placeholder text on this book. I wonder if Sandi was the background artist.\n\nMost of the episode, as you might expect, revolves around barn raising. Because that’s obviously all such people do.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Cartoon chaos with the anarchic duo. Episodes are A Meticulous Analysis of History and Funny You Don’t Look Rhennish.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC ONE Wednesday 13th December 2006 15:50\n\nThe next recording starts with some weather. There’s another Christmas trail, this one featuring comedy.\n\nThere’s also a trail for Pulling.\n\nThen, there’s an episode of Planet Earth that we missed on its first couple of showings – Seasonal Forests. This broadcast is a signed broadcast.\n\nIt’s all about trees.\n\nAnd the animals that live amongst them, like the Lynx.\n\n“In local folklore, the wolverine is a link to the spirit world and a cross between a bear and a wolf. In reality, it’s a huge weasel.” David Attenborough laying down the smack talk there. It doesn’t stop there. “For its size, it’s said that the animal can eat more in one sitting than any other… which is why it’s also known as “the glutton”.”\n\nA Pine Marten steals a bird’s egg.\n\n“This giant sequoia, a relative of the redwood, is the largest living thing on Earth. Known as General Sherman, it’s the weight of ten blue whales.”\n\nThese ducklings are only 24 hours old when they leave the nest, dropping from a height. It’s lucky they’re bouncy.\n\nCicadas emerge from their 17 year hibernation.\n\nSome vultures looking like they’re cosplaying The Dark Crystal.\n\nAn Amur Leopard, the rarest cat on Earth.\n\nLemurs!\n\nIn the Diaries section cameraman Warwick Sloss has his first trip in a cinebule, or film balloon. He’s quite stoic about it. “I must say I’m slightly nervous of it, partly because it’s basically a deckchair with a balloon on top, and partly because I can see where my head’s gonna be – it’s gonna be incredibly close to that burner. I do have a fear of heights. I mostly have a fear of falling through them onto the ground.”\n\nIt’s not all smooth flying.\n\nHere’s the episode on iPlayer.\n\nMedia Centre Description: David Attenborough’s documentary series which celebrates our planet in all its eclectic wonder. He reveals the greatest woodlands on earth, from the evergreen forests of the frozen north to the deciduous dry forests of the equator. The Taiga forest is a silent world of stunted conifers cloaked in snow and ice; by contrast the broadleaf forests of North America and Europe bustle with life, while the baobab forests of Madagascar are the strangest of all, with bizarre upside down trees.\n\nRecorded from BBC ONE on Thursday 14th December 2006 00:33\n\nBBC Genome: BBC ONE Thursday 14th December 2006 00:35\n\nAfter this, there’s a trail for a new drama, Born Equal with a starry cast including Colin Firth, Anne Marie Duff, David Oyelowo and Robert Carlisle.\n\nThere’s also a repeat of the trail for Drama at Christmas. Then the recording stops just after a signed edition of A Child Against All Odds."
