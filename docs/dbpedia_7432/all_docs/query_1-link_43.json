        "text": "Are you pondering what Iâm pondering? No, it has nothing to do with monkeys and dental floss. Weâre ranking every single one of Brainâs schemesâboth from the Pinky and the Brain series and their shorts on Animaniacsâand thereby take over the internet! (Enh, weâll figure that part out later.)\n\nA version of this article originally appeared May 27th, 2016.\n\n1) Brain buys every property in the world above its 39th floorâ¦\n\nâ¦with plans to melt the polar ice caps using the Hubble Space Telescope. The survivors will be forced to live in his legally owned property. This is Brain at his most wickedâplanning to enslave humanity through a housing crisis after a cataclysmic disaster. Well done!\n\n2) Brain dons his human suitâ¦\n\nâ¦to get a job, stage a workplace accident, and use the money from the injury claim to build an automated answering machine system to keep everyone on Earth distracted while he takes over the world. The best part of this one is the accident itselfâBrain convinces his work that the break roomâs non-dairy creamer turned him into a mouse.\n\n3) Pinky and the Brain become famous childrenâs TV performersâ¦\n\nâ¦then cryogenically freeze themselves for 40 years. When theyâre thawed out, their fans will have grown up into the new world leaders, and they will be worshiped. This is airtight. The existence of this article is evidence enough of their potential success. Attempted a second time on Elmyra.\n\n4) Brain creates a fictional island nationâ¦\n\nâ¦in an attempt to exploit the United States for billions in foreign aid so he can build a giant clothes dryer to enslave humanity with static electricity. A fictional island nation is pretty clever, but the giant clothes dryer would probably work a lot better in colder climates.\n\n5) Brain mixes the bufotoxins of psychoactive toadsâ¦.\n\nâ¦with crabmeat and host a hypnotic Pancake Jamboreeâand take over the world! Psychotropic crabs native to the ruins of one of the 20th Centuryâs greatest maritime disasters sure sounds like a four-issue story arc of Peter Milliganâs Shade, The Changing Man. But, no! It was the very first episode of Pinky and the Brain. I love the idea, but fear Brainâhad his plans not been so dramatically derailed by Pinky and the CIAâwould wind up with a severely diluted compound of crab extract before exhausting the shipwreckâs population of spider crabs.\n\n6) Brain poses as Jimmy Hoffaâ¦\n\nâ¦back from vacation, causing all labor leaders to bow before him. They will help him construct a machine to creature miniature geysers able to life people inches off the ground, immobilizing them. Crushingly, this is only a proposed plan in a Pinky-centric episode.\n\n7) Brain authors a popular romance novelâ¦\n\nâ¦containing a hypnophonetic sentence so long and confusing, the reader will be forced to re-read it endlessly out loud. The frequencies of those sounds will hypnotize all around them. Another proposed idea from the same Pinky-centric episode.\n\n8) Pink and Brain infiltrates an Egyptian tombâ¦\n\nâ¦and pose as mummies, then demand fealty when theyâre discovered by archeologists. Love it.\n\n9) Brain forcibly tunes every radio stationâ¦\n\nâ¦to his fireside chat of propaganda, persuading humanity to allow him to become Earthâs ruler.\n\n10) Pinky becomes President of the United Statesâ¦\n\nâ¦after writing a letter to the editor about his disappointment in the recent installment of Family Circus. While in office, Brain uses access to military satellite uplinks to jam every radio station with Kenny G, Yanni ,and âthe soulful stirringsâ of John Tesh, softening the publicâs cerebral cortexes, rendering them his slaves. Sadly, Brainâs plan was exposed by his own âDeep Throat,â Bill Keane, author of Family Circus (but disguised as Robert Shaw…).\n\n11) Brain fires a rocket at the moonâ¦\n\nâ¦full of billions of tiny, self-adhesive mirrors, converting it into a giant disco ball. He will seize the planet while everyone is busy dancing. Unfortunately, it doesnât happen. Brainâs plans to raise money for the rocket through the abstract art circuit are thwarted when Pinky is revealed to be the better artist. His new plan: to fake Pinkyâs death and sell his paintings posthumously at inflated prices. This fails, too, when Pinky resurfaces at his own memorial luncheon.\n\n12) Brain creates a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© replica of Earthâ¦\n\nâ¦and lures the planetâs entire population to it with the promise of free t-shirts. Unfortunately, a meteor destroys the real Earth and Pinky and the Brain are forced to live on the duplicate. It worked, though.\n\n13) Brain mechanizes the Lincoln Memorialâ¦\n\nâ¦to convince the population he is actually the reincarnated soul of Abraham Lincoln. This premise puts forth a lot of interesting questions: What if Abe Lincoln came back to life? Both parties would probably feel compelled to nominate him, even though they (probably) wouldnât want to. I think the courts would interpret his death as a valid reason he could no longer hold office, though. Would he be eligible for social security?\n\n14) Brain locks everyoneâs cars in their garagesâ¦\n\nâ¦forcing them to ride bicycles and cripple the petroleum industry, bringing the world to its knees. Doable.\n\n15) Brain pretends to be an endangered speciesâ¦\n\nâ¦and is given a large section of Pittsburgh as protected area. He uses the cityâs steel mills to build a series of 3D âmagic eyeâ billboards with no secret message of any kind behind them, just to confuse people and keep them occupied while he takes over the world.\n\n16) Brain imbues Pinky with a new personalityâ¦\n\n…including âthe undiluted machismo of John Wayne, the dynamic sensuality of Valentino, the sensitivity of actorsâ actor Tony Randallâ to create Pinky Suavo, a charismatic celebrity nobody can resist.\n\n17) Brain develops a conspiracy theoryâ¦\n\nâ¦to convince the public unseen forces are deliberately preventing him from seizing power.\n\n18) Brain solicits new ideas from Hollywood screenwritersâ¦\n\nâ¦and uses the one he sees most fit for world domination.\n\n19) Brain exploits a planetary convergenceâ¦\n\nâ¦that causes a gravitational flux and triggers an inner ear imbalance, rendering mankind susceptible to the power of suggestion for 15 seconds. Well if it works, sure!\n\n20) Brain construct a superconductive magnetic âInfindibulatorââ¦\n\nâ¦to deplete hydrogen and promote gravitational collapse, producing a magnetic charge from the center of the Earth so powerful that every person with change in their pockets will be magnetically drawn to the ground. This never happens, sadly, and the episode ends up being about Brain trying to raise money by winning a game show.\n\n21) Pinky and the Brain become silent film starsâ¦\n\nâ¦and make movies telling stories of great courage and heroism. Since people cannot distinguish fantasy from reality, they shall be embraced as great leaders. Hey, it worked for Reagan.\n\n22) Brain becomes a camp counselor for children of world leadersâ¦\n\nâ¦.and has them make pencil sharpeners with implanted listening devices, allowing him to eavesdrop on world leaders.\n\n23) Pinky and the Brain replace the worldâs artificial sweeteners with real onesâ¦\n\nâ¦causing planetary obesity and upsetting the body conscious.\n\n24) Brain shrinks all fedora hats with steamâ¦\n\nâ¦trapping their wearers inside them. The episode is set in 1946, but it works here and now, too!\n\n25) Brain develops a formula to make people allergic to leatherâ¦\n\nâ¦rendering them unable to reach for their wallets, thus crippling the economy.\n\n26) Brain manipulates the worldâs largest magnetâ¦\n\nâ¦to move discarded satellites into position and spell âBrain is your ruler.â\n\n27) Brain hits Pinky with a âgrowing rayââ¦\n\nâ¦then sets him loose on a major city, and then offer to stop his rampage in return for world domination.\n\nBrainâs plan is foiled when the real Godzilla shows up to battle Pinky. At the end of the episode, the ray accidentally causes the rest of the world to grow in response, leaving Pinky & the Brain proportionate dwarves on a planet of giants.\n\n28) Brain joins T.H.E.Yâ¦.\n\nâ¦a secret cabal of puppet masters and clandestine world leaders, then tries to usurp them.\n\n29) Brain becomes a radio serial announcerâ¦\n\nâ¦to control the minds of his listeners with a special voice modulator. These days, heâd need to start one of those prestige true crime podcasts to even make a dent.\n\n30) Brain shifts the Earthâs axisâ¦\n\nâ¦ by one-millionth of a percent, causing a turn in weather patterns and resulting in one less day of rain everywhere in the world except Los Angeles. This will cause a coffee bean shortage and force everyone in the world to switch to tea. He will then destroy every tea bag in the world, except his own, and rise to prominence as the owner of the worldâs only teabag.\n\n31) Brain replaces Steven Spielberg with an androidâ¦\n\nâ¦to take his place as the worldâs most bankable director.\n\n32) Brain installs a control chip in Tom Bodettâs tracheaâ¦\n\nâ¦to make a killing on the lecture circuit.\n\n33) Brain distracts people with lava lampsâ¦\n\nâ¦while solidifying them in a lava-like substance.\n\n34) Brain alters the course of evolutionâ¦\n\nâ¦so mice become the dominant species. Fairly solid.\n\n35) Brain opens a restaurantâ¦\n\nâ¦and serves food laced with an intelligence-enhancing drug, causing people to understand why he should naturally become the leader of the world.\n\n36) Brain becomes a country music starâ¦\n\nâ¦to record subliminal messages in his songs, making his fans unconditionally loyal. His recording name is Bubba Bo Bob Brain, which is pretty damning.\n\n37) Brain raises sentient vegetablesâ¦\n\nâ¦to terrorize humanity into submission. He tries this again with living meat on Elmyra. I think itâs a good idea.\n\n38) Brain unlocks and clones the DNA of field miceâ¦\n\nâ¦to give himself ultra-enhanced night vision, then rule in the darkness of a global power outage. We would have liked to see this play out, but Brain cancels the plan when itâs discovered the test mice are actually his genetic parents.\n\n39) Brain launches a message into spaceâ¦\n\nâ¦to trick invading aliens into believing that he is, in fact, the sovereign ruler of the Earth. Itâs basically The Baron of Arizona on a global scale with a lot less document forgery and aliens. Brainâs plan relied on too many assumptions about the aliens themselves and ends with him getting abducted, soâ¦\n\n40) Brain constructs a potent stink bombâ¦\n\nâ¦and would let its fumes spread across the nationâs capitals, driving government officials into the streets. Pinky and the Brain will then swoop in and seize power. The bomb was composed of weed killer, manure, and Zoysia grass so this could actually work, maybe!\n\n41) Brain replaces the personality quiz in Cosmopolitan magazineâ¦\n\nâ¦with a âWho Is Your Perfect World Leader?â quiz. âBrainâ is the answer to every question. Genius. There isnât a soul reading this that doesnât know their official Hogwarts house placement results.\n\n42) Brain prints the words âProperty of Brainââ¦\n\nâ¦on a discreet area of the Earth, claiming it forever.\n\n43) Brain hosts a treacly reunion specialâ¦\n\nâ¦brainwashing the audience with nostalgic sentiment.\n\n44) Brain dons a pair of hypnotic dentures…\n\nâ¦and becomes a world-famous insult comic. Stand-up comedians are todayâs rock stars; just imagine the platform the AV Club would have given him!\n\n45) Brain freezes the world leaders at an international peace summitâ¦\n\nâ¦for 24 hours, leaving Brain enough time to try to take over the world. The 1960s Batman movie did this way better.\n\n46) Brain injects a paralytic fish enzymeâ¦\n\nâ¦into his own brand of âCappy Brainâs Frozen Fish Sticksâ\n\n47) Brain communicates with the Earth directlyâ¦\n\nâ¦by building a device that brings inanimate objects to life, including the moon.\n\n48) Brain alters the directions on every shampoo bottle in the worldâ¦\n\nâ¦with the addendum ârepeat endlessly,â lathering mankind into oblivion.\n\n49) Brain mutates the worldâs caviarâ¦\n\nâ¦with peanut DNA, giving it a peanut buttery consistency. This will immobilize the worldâs rich by silencing them forever.\n\n50) Brain hypnotizes emperor Franz Josef I of Austriaâ¦\n\nâ¦and orders him to give Brain the right to the imperial throne.\n\n51) Brain will continuously clone himselfâ¦\n\nâ¦until he has an army of clones all working for the same goal: world domination. This goes about as well as youâd expect. He tries this in two separate episodes, actually.\n\n52) Brain becomes a hippie thought leaderâ¦\n\nâ¦and unleashes a radio signal during a peace chant via the dental work of his followers.\n\n53) Brain magnetically harness the moon to Earthâ¦\n\nâ¦during a solar eclipse, controlling its sunlight.\n\n54) Brain turns on all the water valves in Vienna at onceâ¦\n\nâ¦draining the Blue Danube and bring shipping to a standstill, then somehow rising to power in the ensuing chaos. Only half of a plan, really… the whole caper took a backseat to a parody of every childâs favorite movie, Carol Reedâs The Third Man.\n\n55) Brain looks into the futureâ¦\n\nâ¦with a virtual reality headset and see which one of his plans succeeded. Learning he does not become ruler of Earth, Brain becomes a ski instructor.\n\n56) Brain becomes a superheroâ¦\n\nâ¦called the Cranial Crusader, and will use the ensuing fame and goodwill as a forum to rule the world. Repeated on Elmyra.\n\n57) Brain broadcasts the sound of a dripping faucetâ¦\n\nâ¦across the globe, driving everyone insane.\n\n58) Brain becomes a fashion designerâ¦\n\nâ¦to market a hypnotic perfume called âSubjugation.â Attempted a second time on Elymra.\n\n59) Brain hijacks a tornadoâ¦\n\nâ¦creating âan ambulatory weather system of unstoppable might.â The entire episode is a timely parody of the (then recently released) movie Twister.\n\n60) Brain joins the Pompous Adventurers Clubâ¦\n\nâ¦a secret society whose membership are known to become Prime Minister of England. To become club president, he must travel the world within 79 days.This is almost like a plan?\n\n61) Brain develops a recipe for exploding crepesâ¦.\n\nâ¦and is incarcerated until the government of France mistakes him for Napoleon Bonaparte. Lucked out on that one!\n\n62) Brain directs the ultimate tearjerkerâ¦\n\nâ¦a schmaltzy football drama called Brainâs Song. He shall take over the world while everyone is weeping. Foiled when the electric football tabletop used for the filmâs set keeps electrocuting him.\n\n63) Brain creates an infomercialâ¦\n\nâ¦to sell an elixir that makes its users shorter than himself. He will then rule as worldâs tallest man. The idea of the tallest being the best rulers would later turn up on Invader Zim.\n\n64) Brain forms an army of aquatic sea mammalsâ¦\n\nâ¦who would be too adorable to attack and take control of the worldâs oil supply.\n\n65) Brain will become a child actorâ¦\n\nâ¦and endear the world with his precocious talents.\n\n66) Brain incites a collectible card crazeâ¦\n\nâ¦that puts its players under his thrall once the entire set is completed. Like all CCGs, it only leads to a witch hunt by concerned parents.\n\n67) Brain makes the Sunday crossword puzzle unsolvableâ¦\n\nâ¦sending the intelligentsia into a dither while he steps into take over the world.\n\n68) Brain distributes an educational filmâ¦\n\nâ¦to public schools called Your Friend: World Domination, extolling the benefits of his world leadership.\n\n69) Brain becomes a professional basketball playerâ¦\n\nâ¦endearing himself to the public. His fans will follow his career until he takes over the world. Space Jam was in theaters at the time. coincedence? I think not.\n\n70) Brain markets wooden furnitureâ¦\n\nâ¦with assembly directions demanding people obey him.\n\n71) Brain tries to harness the power of Samsonâs hairâ¦\n\nAn apocryphal P&B caper, at best.\n\n72) Brain adapts War of the Worlds for televisionâ¦\n\nâ¦inciting a panic similar to the infamous Mercury Theater Broadcast in 1938. That âpanicâ has been overstated for decades, letâs be honest.\n\n73) Brain ceases the rotation of Earthâ¦\n\nâ¦causing everyone to fly off. Funny visual, but no.\n\n74) Brain mutates a group of beaversâ¦\n\nâ¦and makes them build a series of dams, allowing him to control waterways and flood major cities.\n\n75) Brain steals the gold from Fort Knoxâ¦\n\nâ¦and control the money supply of the United States. ClichÃ©. Boring.\n\n76) Brain builds a massive water heaterâ¦\n\nâ¦allowing medieval English peasantry to bathe more frequently. Unencumbered by debilitating body odor, they will worship Brain for his generosity. The episode was a Robin Hood parody (the Kevin Costner Robin Hood, to be precise).\n\n77) Brain disable Big Ben at tea timeâ¦\n\nâ¦causing it to remain tea time forever, allowing Brain to take over the British Empire, and eventually the world.\n\n78) Brain runs for President of the United Statesâ¦\n\nâ¦with Pinky as his running mate. A dry run for the later âPinky becomes presidentâ episode. Does this a third time with Elmyra.\n\n79) Brain infiltrates Area 51â¦\n\nâ¦and meets the alien, Zalgar, hoping he will help him take over the world. Regrettably, Zalgar just wanted to eat his brain. Missed opportunity.\n\n80) Brain produces mind-controlling birthday candlesâ¦\n\nâ¦that release a noxious green cast when snuffed out. Pinky and the Brain are kidnapped by the Simian Liberation Army before this can happen. This episode featured Roddy MacDowellâs character, Snowball!\n\n81) Brain broadcasts an acapella version of Dream Weaverâ¦\n\nâ¦as performed by Rush Limbaugh on an infinite loop, driving mankind insane. To horrible to even contemplate, even for Brain.\n\n82) Brain performs a spell of Merlinâsâ¦\n\nâ¦to take over the world, but struggles to obtain an essential ingredientâthe red toenail of a dragon.\n\n83) Brain will tap danceâ¦\n\nâ¦a subliminal message in Morse code at the 1939 Worldâs Fair.\n\n84) Brain concocts a chain letter schemeâ¦\n\nâ¦that will make him ruler of the world by spelling âyou will bow before the Brainâ backwards. Violates Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302, the Postal Lottery Statute.\n\n85) Brain steals Russiaâs Crown Jewels during a lunar eclipseâ¦\n\nâ¦and benefit? Itâs pretty half-baked, but the eclipse is nice.\n\n86) Brain harnesses the power of Zeusâ¦\n\nâ¦by stealing his lightning bolt, and overthrowing him. The Greek mythology angle gives this one bit of a leg up on the other educational episodes, but still.\n\n87) Pinky and the Brain perform a Star Wars parodyâ¦\n\nâ¦where Brain will conquer the universe with his âMega Star.â Itâs not a plan, itâs a very silly episode..\n\n88) Brain mines for âsinusiteââ¦\n\nâ¦then plans to powderize it, and control the world with sneezing powder.\n\n89) Brain sends everyone in the world junk mailâ¦\n\nâ¦driving them insane. Getting lazy.\n\n90) Brain invents hypnotic sunscreenâ¦\n\nâ¦and becomes King of the Beach in 1963.\n\n91) Brain reinvents himself as a living legendâ¦\n\nâ¦by distributing a folk tale to public schools.\n\n92) Brain replaces the Declaration of Independenceâ¦\n\nâ¦with Brainâs revised Declaration of Obedience. Set in 1776, this was one of those edutainment episodes with absolutely no stakes.\n\n93) Brain clones dinosaurs with mosquito DNA after watching Jurassic Park\n\nThis was the only original âTake Over the Worldâ plot on Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain, shamefully.\n\n94) Brain poses as one of Santaâs elves â¦\n\nâ¦so he can put a hypnotic doll on the Christmas lists of every child in the world. What if they donât celebrate Christmas, Brain? Too many variables here."
