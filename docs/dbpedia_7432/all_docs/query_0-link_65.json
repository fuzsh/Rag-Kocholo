        "text": "A dermatome is an area of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, forming nerve roots that branch from your spinal cord, but only 30 dermatomes.\n\nYour spinal nerves help to relay sensory, motor, and autonomic information between the rest of your body and your central nervous system (CNS).\n\nSo why are dermatomes important? How many are there? And where can they be found? Continue reading as we answer these questions about dermatomes and more.\n\nA single spinal nerve supplies sensation to certain areas of your skin, including each of your dermatomes.\n\nYour spinal nerves\n\nSpinal nerves are part of your peripheral nervous system (PNS). Your PNS works to connect the rest of your body with your CNS, which is made up of your brain and spinal cord.\n\nYou have 31 pairs of spinal nerves. They form nerve roots that branch from your spinal cord. Spinal nerves are named and grouped by the region of the spine that they’re associated with.\n\nThe five groups of spinal nerves are:\n\nCervical nerves: There are eight pairs of these cervical nerves, numbered C1 through C8. They originate from your neck.\n\nThoracic nerves: You have 12 pairs of thoracic nerves, numbered T1 through T12. They originate in the part of your spine that makes up your torso.\n\nLumbar nerves: There are five pairs of lumbar spinal nerves, designated L1 through L5. They come from the part of your spine that makes up your lower back.\n\nSacral nerves: Like the lumbar spinal nerves, you have five pairs of sacral spinal nerves. They’re associated with your sacrum, one of the bones in your pelvis.\n\nCoccygeal nerves: You have only a single pair of coccygeal spinal nerves, which originate from the area of your coccyx, or tailbone.\n\nYour dermatomes\n\nEach of your dermatomes is associated with a single spinal nerve. These nerves transmit sensations, such as pain, from a specific area of your skin to your CNS.\n\nYour body has 30 dermatomes, one less than the number of spinal nerves. This is because the C1 spinal nerve typically doesn’t have a sensory root. As a result, dermatomes begin with spinal nerve C2.\n\nDermatomes have a segmented distribution throughout your body. The exact dermatome pattern can actually vary from person to person. Some overlap between neighboring dermatomes may also occur.\n\nBecause spinal nerves exit the spine laterally, dermatomes associated with the torso and core are distributed horizontally. When viewed on a body map, they appear like stacked discs.\n\nThe dermatome pattern in the limbs is slightly different. This is due to the shape of the limbs as compared with the rest of the body. In general, dermatomes associated with your limbs run vertically along the long axis of the limbs, such as down your leg."
