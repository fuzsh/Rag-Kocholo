        "text": "After the Newsreel of the Stars and the regular intro — that I thought were one and the same, back then — the episode begins with one of the most well-remembered segments in the series: the Yakko’s World song.\n\nHere, Rob Paulsen — Yakko’s voice actor — sings the names of the majority of the world’s countries, as they were in the early 1990s, to the tune of Jarabe tapatío, the Mexican Hat Song. And that’s it. But that doesn’t do it justice, not by a long shot. Youtube to the rescue.\n\nIt’s really impressive in how quick it is, how Rob trips so many complicated names off the tongue. Even if reading off a page, it’s excellent. I can only imagine what kind of practise and rehearsal went into it. If I recall, I picked up on one of the Animanicast episodes that it was a song that predated Animaniacs — written by Rob? Randy Rogel? — so I guess it didn’t need too much.\n\nThere are mistakes in this list of nations. Too many for me to care. See the Animaniacs wiki if you want to check them out. It doesn’t really matter. This is a treat to open the show with, though some little thing in the back of my head didn’t completely trust it. It felt like it was trying to sneak education in under the cover of fun —\n\nThis segment opens in Bern, Switzerland in 1905. Our first hint that the Warner sibs will travel throughout time and space to bother historical figures, like a latter-day Bill and Ted. The Warners are there to sell ‘Kid Scout’ cookies, the exposition given in a personal little jingle that concludes with Wakko going off on a yodelling fit that would have turned into a Cab Calloway impression if it went on for another ten seconds. But at that moment a visual gag wanders past.\n\nSurprisingly, it’s Yakko who calls Wakko to heel. The Swiss Miss is an obvious reference to the hot chocolate brand but a part of me, just for a second, wondered if the Marx Brothers influence on the three Warners had wavered a little, and the opening of Cookies for Einstein was a small nod to the 1938 Laurel and Hardy film ‘Swiss Miss’. A story in which Stan and Ollie visit Switzerland, selling mousetraps door to door.\n\nThere’s one last house to sell to, and the name on the mailbox is Albert Einstein, who’s currently racking his brains to figure out the theory of relativity. He’s throwing — stuff — at the board to see what sticks.\n\nEinstein’s interrupted by the Warners at his door, who mistake his rant about ‘black holes’ for blackheads’ and assume he’s a dermatologist. This is played with during the segment and here and now, gives the idea that Einstein is going to get the same treatment as the P-sychiatrist, Doctor Scratchansnif, from episode one. It also gives a good grossout snigger at Einstein being offered Wakko’s wart. Wakko’s skin conditions don’t impress Einstein and he slams the door in the Warner’s faces. It leads to a couple of nice character moments for Dot and Yakko as the spotlight focuses on her dramatic but not entirely sincere lament —\n\n— and Yakko’s reassurance that they’ll sell Einstein cookies or die trying.\n\nAs in De-Zanitized — relentlessly cheerful.\n\nNow for more cartoon antics. While Einstein is measuring the speed of light (“Boy, that’s quick!”) the Warners appear in his house, out of thin air, in the grand Looney Tunes tradition. They do this a couple of times but somehow the first time, when Einstein swings his chalkboard around, tickles me the most. Speed it up and it’s almost a jump scare.\n\nNot to mention bamboozling him out of his own home.\n\nThe Warners step up the sales pitch. There’s a moment where Einstein’s offered a free chia pet, that feels like it’s meant to be a joke but it’s hard to say how. It’s forgotten by the time the great pocket fisherman gag plays out. From literal interpretation to toilet humor before you can blink.\n\nEinstein breaks down, and the Warners finally take pity on him, pulling him into their mutual support group as they recite the ACME song. Yakko spells the letters on Einstein’s chalkboard, and Wakko picks up with his verse, writing them backwards — EMCA.\n\nIt sparks something in Einstein. Shakingly, feverishly, he reaches out with the chalk and draws an equals sign in among Wakko’s letters, and the A that looks like a 2. E=MC2!\n\nIt’s Einstein’s triumphant moment, and we quickly segue to his receiving of the Nobel Prize for Physics, graciously shared with the Warner siblings.\n\nAnd with that, another reminder that what goes on in the heads of these kids, their wants and obsessions, are happily askew.\n\nWhat to think of this segment? It’s good. It’s not great, but it’s good. All the Warners and Einstein get their moments and most of the jokes and gags land. It almost feels like a breather, maintaining the rush of the first episode before we dive into the rest of the series. TMS is almost restrained in their animation compared to their other work for Animaniacs, though some sequences shine through. In places the Warners’ proportions and features make them look especially young, but that’s nothing compared to the design of Einstein used in this segment. The big, round head represents his intelligence, but the characters face, proportions and coiffured hair might have more in common with, say, Mindy, than Einstein. I think the segment itself drives it home when it recreates the famous ‘tongue’ photo!\n\nAlso, different Animaniacs fan media point out how E=MC2 isn’t the theory of relativity, but the mass-energy equation. But they don’t point out what the theory of relativity is. Well here’s what the Warners helped Kid Einstein to discover —\n\nThe first segment that focuses on characters other than the Warners. We saw Pinky and the Brain in the first episode, twice. We know they ‘want to rule the universe’, now we find out how they aim to go about it.\n\nThe Brain tries to rope Pinky into a scheme for world domination, but Pinky is too distracted watching The Honeymooners on the lab TV. Brain isn’t impressed, but his voice doesn’t rise much above a steady monotone, even when threatening Pinky with violent punishment.\n\nIt’s a deadpan Orson Welles impression given to the character by voice actor Maurice LaMarche, and it adds a lot of humor, here and down the line — especially contrasted with Pinky’s gawky, manic tones, provided by Rob ‘Yakko’ Paulsen.\n\nBrain manages to make Pinky concentrate, for a while at least, as he lays out his plan. And it’s a ridiculous, crazy, Rube-Goldberg, Bond-villain plot. He’ll use a ‘superconductive magnetic infindibulator’ to create a magnetic charge from the center of the earth and cause everyone to be stuck to the ground by the loose change in their pocket.\n\nIt’s brilliantly stupid, and the absurd ideas and situations keep piling on. Pinky picks out the one flaw he can see (“No, wait. What if they take off their pants?”), which is one more than the Brain anticipated. They need an infindibulator but can only source one from the Farmer’s Almanac, and even then it’s not the device itself but the plans to build one.\n\nI think it takes a second or third view for all this to sink in. It piles up like a David Zucker film, almost too quick to notice, and we’re far from done. The duo wonder how they can raise the funds, being lab mice and all, and Brain is inspired by the TV that Pinky left on. He realises that someone could win $99,000 by answering every question correctly on the game show ‘Gyp-Parody’.\n\nBrain prepares a disguise to enter the show, and it slots nicely into the unfolding farce. It’s a robot body in the shape of an enormous suited man, complete with bowtie, and Brain’s own (relatively) small mouse head peers out of the cockpit at the very top. It’s a funny image.\n\nI wonder how the reboot would play with that?\n\nPinky and the Brain arrive at the TV studio in this contraption and Brain proceeds to thrash the other contestants.\n\nHe soon wins the $49,500 that he can double in Final Gyp-Parody. Brain needs to give just one more correct answer — in the form of a question — and he’s won the $99,000. But who is known for saying “Bang, zoom, right in the kisser”?\n\nIt’s Ralph Kramden of course, from The Honeymooners, the show that Brain tried his level best to ignore for the whole segment. He can’t answer and loses every cent he won up to that point. Back at the lab, his sense of dejection fairly flows out of the screen.\n\nBut he can’t mope around forever. He has to prepare for tomorrow night —\n\nOthers have said how Pinky and the Brain seemed to spring fully-formed onto the screen, with few changes, and just worked. It’s difficult to disagree when the formula carried them onto not one but two spin-off shows. Forget the Hip Hippos, this pair were the real breakout stars of the show. The simple premise that could be endlessly played with, the character designs, the catchphrases — “The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to take over the world!” and “Are you pondering what I’m pondering?” — with the bizarre non-sequitur responses (“I think so Brain, but where are we going to get a duck and a hose at this hour?”) — and the classic interplay between the dummy and the dummy who thinks he’s smart.\n\nHard to say how it wouldn’t work.\n\nThis first segment didn’t just have its own mini-intro, as most of the other characters would have, but two. This first segment features the version animated by Wang, who would handle most of the Pinky and the Brain segments. The version used later, and more often, was animated by TMS. The difference is notable, especially when you’re expecting the latter, and not just because the Warners show up ‘in person’ to present the pair of lab mice in the Wang version. Brain’s mouth movements in particular seem a little sloppy, in comparison, but it ruins nothing.\n\nKnowing a bit more about how episodes of Animaniacs were put together, The Wheel of Morality begins to feel a little like filler. But that’s selling it short. A lot of cartoons came with miniature PSAs tacked onto the end, and even Tiny Toons had its share of ‘very special episodes’, so when Yakko summoned the Wheel of Morality with a phony sense of reverence and landed on random life lessons, I got what it was trying to lampoon from the get-go. I loved it for that alone, and it only got better with the snarky and nonsensical morals that writer Mark Sweeney provided.\n\nFor this first bit, “if at first you don’t succeed, blame it on your parents.” Nice. It’s a 90s sort of reference, makes me think of an episode of Seinfeld or Friends. It’s still pretty relevant today, though I think it could use an update for 2020.\n\nAlso, I get a little chuckle out of the green section of the wheel. ‘Morally bankrupt’.\n\nNOW I GET IT\n\nHello Nice Warners and the Animanicast inform us that Win Big is based on the Honeymooners episode ‘The $99000.00 Answer’, where Ralph is annoyed by Ed playing ‘Swannee River’ on the piano, which ends up being the answer to the question he’s asked on a big-stakes game show. It explains the Ralph Kramden references in the segment! I’m not sure how it makes me feel about Win Big — homage or rip-off? It takes away some of the feel of originality, but I think it’s still held up by the peculiarities of the characters and their situation. It’s still Pinky and the Brain.\n\nIt’s also the only episode of The Honeymooners I’ve watched, via Youtube.\n\nAlso, after putting together some images for this blog post, I feel a brand new respect for the background artists on this show.\n\nA THOUSAND WORDS\n\nCase in point, look at that cartoon Bern. Ain’t that nice?\n\nA shot of the Warners and their synchronised yodelling, all lined up as they swing about the screen.\n\nThese feel like in-jokes in the Farmer’s Almanac, but I don’t get them.\n\nAnd a shot that demonstrates the Brain’s pomposity, that soon comes back to bite him. Pinky pops out of the robot suit’s pocket while Brain plays Gyp-Parody, cheering him on. There’s not a word from Brain, barely even an acknowledgement, just a quick flick at his poor sidekick’s head.\n\nNEXT: don’t call us, we’ll call you."
