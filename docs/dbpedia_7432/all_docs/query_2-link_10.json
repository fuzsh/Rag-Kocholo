        "meta_description": "Insane And The Brain by the great Luke Ski, released 28 July 2003\n\nPinky:   So Brain, what are we going to do tonight? \r\nBrain:    The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to take over the world! \r\n\r\nPinky:   Ha ha ha ha ha, NARF! \r\nBrain:    Quiet Pinky, or I shall have to hurt you! With our subliminal message and there hardcore rap lyrics, we will take over the world! \r\nPinky:   Narf! Poit! Boo-yah! \r\nBrain:    Now take it to the grill one time, Pinky! \r\nPinky:   Oh, right-o Brain! Ha ha haa, NARF! \r\n\r\nPinky: \r\nOh, we&#39;re the mice the plan, ain&#39;t no scam. \r\nThere&#39;s a fool-proof plan on the diagram. \r\nA-this jam, across the world will span! \r\nWham! From Burbank, to Pakistan! \r\n\r\nBrain: \r\nYou&#39;ll all obey the subliminal message. \r\nBrain, washing minds, like my name was Newt Gingrich. \r\n\r\nPinky:   Narf! \r\n\r\nBrain: \r\nAre you pondering what I&#39;m pondering? \r\nWe&#39;ll rule the world, whatcha wondering? \r\n\r\nPinky: \r\nOh! Well, Brain, I think so... \r\nBut do you think Regis will let us be on his show? \r\n\r\nBrain: \r\nI&#39;ve got to maintain, \r\nthat a lab mouse like you is going insane! \r\n\r\nPinky:   Narf! Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    He&#39;s insane, I&#39;m the Brain! YES! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\nPinky:   Narf! \r\n\r\nPinky: \r\nNow Pinky&#39;s on the mic, \r\nI&#39;m fresh, like a daffodilly! \r\nDance, fun fun, silly willy! \r\nI&#39;m your favorite sidekick! Don&#39;t deny it! \r\nI&#39;m getting dizzy, and I think I rather like it! \r\nBrain gets mad like Ralph Kramden. Bang-Zoom! \r\nJust like in a cartoon! \r\nI know we&#39;ll rule the world brightly, \r\nbut we&#39;ll just screw up and we&#39;ll get foiled nightly. \r\nYakko? ZORT! Wakko, Dot? \r\nBobby, Squit, Pesto? Scratchandsniff, Plotz? \r\nTheir big claim to fame is so lame, \r\nA lab mouse like me is going insane! \r\n\r\nPinky:   Narf! Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    He&#39;s insane, I&#39;m the Brain! YES! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\n\r\nBrain&#39;s subliminal message:        You are under my control, you will do whatever I say. \r\n\r\nB. Real:                        They&#39;re Pinky and the Brain, Pinky and the Brain, \r\nOne is a genius, the other&#39;s insane! \r\nThey&#39;re laboratory mice! \r\nCypress Hill:      THEY&#39;RE GENES HAVE BEEN SPLICED! \r\nB. Real:                        To prove their mousey worth, \r\nCypress Hill:      THEY&#39;LL OVERTHROW THE EARTH! \r\nB. Real:                        They&#39;re Animani- \r\nCypress Hill:      TOTALLY INSANEY! \r\nB. Real:                        They&#39;re inky, they&#39;re dinky, \r\nCypress Hill:      THEY&#39;RE PINKY AND THE BRAIN! \r\n\r\nBrain: \r\nLike Louis Armstrong, played a trumpet, \r\nI&#39;ll rule this world at the size of a crumpet. \r\nYou, will all become my props. \r\nCops, never try to stop my plots. \r\nThose pigs cannot blow this mouse down! YES! \r\nSoon town to town will fall to the ground. \r\nWorld peace is surely going to increase, \r\nIt&#39;s as easy as a piece of cheese. \r\nIconoclastin&#39; blastin&#39; stone col&#39; rockin&#39; \r\nnoodle noggin with a proletariat dream. \r\nSoon, with this midnight scheme, \r\nI&#39;ll become the rodentia supreme. \r\nThrough the world I will reign, like Charles Foster Kane, \r\nCause a lab mouse like me is known as the Brain! YES! \r\n\r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    He&#39;s insane, I&#39;m the Brain! YES! \r\nPinky:   Insane, and my man, Brain! \r\nBrain:    Insane, and the Brain! \r\nPinky:   Narf! \r\n\r\nPinky:   Zounds, Brain! Isn&#39;t being a gangsta rapper the best fun ever! Hee hee, NARF! \r\nBrain:    Pinky, we&#39;ve done our job too well! Our hip hop jam is so funky, it&#39;s completely deluded our subliminal message! Come, we must return to our cage, so I can think of a better plan for tomorrow night. \r\nPinky:   Why, Brain? What are we going to do tomorrow night? \r\n\r\nBrain:                The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try and take over the world! \r\nSingers:            They&#39;re dinky, they&#39;re Pinky and the Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain. \r\nPinky:               NARF!",
