        "text": "Season 1\n\nSeason 2\n\n...actually I'm not sure if I watched that far into the show when I was a kid, I only caught its reruns on Kix! (anyone remember when Pop Max was called Kix?) every now and again, but whatever, moving on (just a heads up-season 3 is almost thrice as long as season 1/season 2 were so this might be a long one):\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n--Seasons 1 and 2 started with full 22 minute episodes, but season 3 splits its first episode into multiple segments, which is somewhat interesting considering its the first and only season to do so. I think my favourite joke in the first episode (the second segment in it, \"Cinebrainia\") is that Walt Disney cameo.\n\n--I can't NOT talk about \"Pinky and the Brain... And Larry\". The story behind this one is that Kids WB! demanded that the staff add additional characters (specifically a third main character) to the show, and this segment was their response. The nailed lampooning the idea-Larry's dialogue is generic and repetitive, he adds nothing to the plot, he steals bits from other characters (specifically Pinky, with him sometimes being bopped by Brain for acts of stupidity, it's even claimed that he says narf too in the intro). \"Three Blind Mice\" even plays when they're in the White House, that was a cute detail. It's perfect, this segment gets its point across quite clearly. Unfortunately execs didn't listen and made the staff create \"Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain\" anyway...ugh. This is still a fun segment, but the existence of \"Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain\" makes it kinda sad in hindsight.\n\n--Mr. Clown (from the Animanaics segment \"Clown N Out\") makes a cameo in \"Where the Deer and the Mousealopes Play\". It's a silent cameo and he doesn't add much to the story at all, but I just wanted take take this opportunity to say that I head canon that he and Mr. Director are the same person. After \"Hearts of Twilight\", I headcanon Mr. Director was fired, couldn't find get a job as director anywhere else, and took a job as a clown to make due. They're not confirmed to be the same person, and I know the reason they're similar is because they're both references to Jerry Lewis, but I think it makes sense and until they're in the same room at the same time I'm not changing my mind. But uh, anyway-back to Pinky and the Brain.\n\n--Billie returns in \"Brain Noir\", which was a fun episode. Snowball's there also, so that was cool. This segment sort of creates a love square (its so weird using that phrase when not talking about Miraculous Ladybug) between Billie, Brain, Snowball and Pinky. Not that that matters because this episode was most likely a scripted episode in-universe anyway (supposedly takes place in the 40's yet Brain has already met Billie and Pinky already knows who Snowball is despite meeting him for the first time in \"Snowball\"), but still I liked the character dynamics in this episode.\n\n--In \"Pinky's Plan\" it's Brain's birthday, and there's a joke about how Pinky couldn't even count to 2. That itself isn't that interesting, but what is interesting is that in the Animaniacs reboot segment \"Happy Narfday!\" it's Pinky's birthday, and there's a similar joke, but this time he manages to count to 3 before getting stuck. It's nice to know he's gotten slightly better at counting (character...development???) Although Brain already mentioned being two years old in season 1, but whatever. This segment was good, Pinky planning that surprise party for Brain was sweet, though it's kinda sad that Brain would've had the world if he had just trusted Pinky more (although it's nice to see how their relationship has developed since then-compare that to how he trusts Pinky over his own future self in \"Future Brain\"). But it's nothing we didn't already know-Pinky loves Brain and would give him the world if he could, Brain has book smarts but has the emotional intelligence of a cucumber, same old same old.\n\n--Brain goes through a midlife crisis in \"This Old Mouse\" after seeing a future where he and Pinky grow old and still haven't taken over the world. I think the most memorable gag in this one is when he uses water as a substitute for alcohol. Pinky even puts his foot down afterwards and shows him some tough love by taking Brain away from the bottle and telling him to \"Just Say Narf\". I like seeing more of these moments where Pinky show concern over Brain's health. The whole episode was less comedy focused and more of a straightforward story about Brain temporarily losing his perseverance and trying to find a new way to spend his life; and on top of that there's a great lesson about how the future isn't set in stone and Pinky once again shows his undying love loyalty to Brain. This is probably one of my favourite episodes in the show (my other favourites right now are \"TV or Not TV\", \"A Pinky and the Brain Christmas\", \"Snowball\", \"The Pink Candidate\", and \"Welcome to the Jungle\").\n\n--To be honest, in addition to being more of a cynical series, the entirety of Pinky and the Brain so far seems a little less comedy focused than the original Animaniacs was (though it's still undoubtedly a pretty madcap cartoon comedy) and seems to focus a bit more on character-driven, slightly (and I do mean slightly) more grounded and serious stories. I like this-I'm glad there's more of a distinction between the two shows other than \"one is wacky comedy that stars puppy children who are insane, the other is a wacky comedy that stars mice men who are insane\", you know?\n\n--\"Brain Drained\" is another pretty meta episode (kinda like \"Megalomaniacs Anonymous\", but rather than one moment that kickstarts the plot, it's the entire premise that's meta) about Brain not wanting to repeat episode plots plans for world domination, so he literally tries to hire new writers for \"Pinky and the Brain\" so he can steal their ideas and use them as plans to take over the world. This show doesn't use meta humour as much as Animaniacs does, so those moments where it does stand out more. Also I loved the jabs at action shows that are mostly merchandise-driven and overly-cutesy shows (like TMNT/Transformers and Smurfs/Care Bears for example). Pretty sure it was also a jab at the network (Kids WB/The WB), which wanted the show to shift focus from world domination.\n\n--Actually, speaking of episode ideas, it just me or are some of these segment plots getting rather...I don't know, I don't wanna say \"scraping the bottom of the barrel\", that's too harsh because it's not like many of these episodes are bad, but some of these segments could literally be summed up as \"Pinky and the Brain talk to beavers\", \"Pinky and the Brain Celtic dance\", \"Pinky and the Brain run out of ideas\", etc. Some of these plots give the impression that they were struggling to come up with over 33 ideas for segments this season.\n\n--If A Pinky and the Brain Christmas emphasised just how much Pinky cared for Brain, \"A Pinky and the Brain Halloween\" does vice versa. It kinda feels like a follow-up in a way, even Brain's plan in the beginning is similar to the one he had in the Christmas special. It's nice to see Brain literally give up not only the world, but any chance in the future to take over the world if it meant he didn't lose Pinky. Also Snowball's in this episode, so that's always fun. He wasn't in it for long but he's apparently the one who convinced the Devil to make a deal with Brain in the first place, so there's that. Also this is apparently the only episode of the show after season 1 to air during primetime, which I'm positive is because it has Hell and the Devil in it (in fact, \"Hot, Bothered and Bedeviled\" was almost banned for that exact reason).\n\n--The spin-off gives us another backstory for Brain in \"Leggo My Ego\". Apparently Brain was taken from his parents and home as a child, brought to Acme Labs where mice were conditioned to submit to the will of humans, and punished for acting even slightly out of line. Sigmund Freud (yes, that one) comes to the conclusion that Brain doesn't really want to take over the world, but rather wants to return home (since his old home was a can with a picture of the globe on the label). This take on his backstory is pretty good, and is actually goes well with the backstory he's given in \"Roadent Trip\". The one in \"Leggo My Ego\" shows how he got to Acme Labs in the first place, and his tail isn't kinked throughout it all. The story in \"Roadent Trip\" probably takes place after that, since it shows how his tail got kinked (and the story of how he met Snowball comes after that, since in that his tail is kinked). Plus if the Acme Labs scientists wanted the mice to submit to the will of humans, then the \"learned helplessness\" experiment makes sense.\n\nAlthough it does mean that Pinky and the Brain, whilst they are about 2 years old physically, have actually been alive for decades (the reboot segment \"The Flawed Couple\" also supports this) since \"Leggo my Ego\" takes place in 1912. So like the Warners, they're older than they look (DO NOT take that the wrong way, the Warners are still children ya creeps) except rather than because they're toons, for Pinky and the Brain it's likely because of their spliced genes.\n\n--The ending of \"You Said a Mouseful\" is easily one of the funniest moments in this show, oh my god. I'm not even gonna spoil it, you gotta see it for yourself. The rest of the episode is okay, but I can tell why it's one of the most well-remembered episodes, it has a unique and fun gimmick (the fastest talking person in the world-at the time-even guest starred!) .\n\n--The Anti-Smoking episode (\"Inherit the Wheeze\") isn't subtle, very in your face, and is a little preachy, but it's still a fine episode. At the end of the day it's spreading a good message, and it's nice to see that Pinky watching and showing concern over Brain's wellbeing is becoming a consistent character trait of his...even if it did feel uncharacteristic of him to suddenly be so knowledgeable about the effects of smoking at points. It's also nice to see Brain give up the chance to take over the world for a reason other than Pinky this time, but rather just because of his own moral principles (although given that Pinky very clearly was against the plan, he likely influenced Brain's decision at least a little). Also, once again there was a jab at Space Jam, well, less of a jab and more of a brutal swipe at it. They didn't like that movie, did they?\n\n--\"Brain's Night Off\" is kinda sad; by the end of it Brain is convinced the only thing he's good at is trying to take over the world, and even then concluded the reason he fails is because he can't even do basic things like enjoy himself. Meanwhile throughout the episode he inspires people to stand up for themselves because he's such a grouch, he was succeeding in gaining followers without even trying, but neither Brain nor Pinky notice at all. Oh the irony.\n\n--Having Eric Idle voice both Pinky's parents is pretty meta, lol (Pinky's voice was partially inspired by Mothy Python). \"The Family That Poits Together, Narfs Together\" was really good. I don't have much to say about it though.\n\n--\"You'll Never Eat Food Pellets In This Town Again\" is another obvious dig at the network, Sandy Dreckman (the head of the network in the episode) is even referred to as Jamie Kellner in Hulu's plot synopsis for this episode! Jamie Kellner is the one responsible for ending this show and the original Animaniacs for those who don't know. It's no secret that Kids WB wanted to revamp the show (despite it already being popular at the time) by adding more characters, moving attention away from from world domination, etc. This episode in basically a response to that. Well, the third response at this point. Not to mention that this was the final episode to have a story by Peter Hastings, who had grown so frustrated with Warner Bros. executives for attempting to change aspects of the show that he left the show to work for Disney. Oh, and this episode is (technically) Billie's final appearance in the show. Wish she was in more than just two episodes of this show (she even complains about her lack of appearances in this episode lol).\n\n--They're Pinky and the Brain, yes Pinky and the Brain\n\nOne has a diploma, the other's...the Brain\n\n--Getting to see Pinky's point of view was adorable, but otherwise \"The Pinky P.O.V.\" was an average episode. It was interesting to see where Pinky's responses to \"Are you pondering what I'm pondering?\" come from though.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn my post about season 2, I said I felt like the dialogue at times felt less concerned with being witty and funny in general and more concerned with namedropping celebrities for the sake of a joke, meaning a lot of the dialogue would only be funny if you knew who they were talking about, and a lot of it is now dated. I think this season had less dialogue with too many namedrops, so that's good. However, now it seems they are focusing more on coming up with random scenarios to put the two mice in and less on doing something new with their characters (for the most part), probably because of the large episode order for this season. This does lead to some episodes having fun gimmicks (like \"You Said a Mouseful\" and \"The Pinky P.OV.\"), but it also leads to some episodes either having kinda lame premises or being similar to previous episodes. There's still some great character writing done here, like Pinky missing his family or Brain trying to do anything other than take over the world; but a lot of it is stuff that we've already seen done before with these characters at this point (Brain giving up the world because of Pinky, giving Brain a sad origin story, showing that Pinky would give Brain the world if he could, Pinky falling in love a with a member of a different species, etc). Again, this is likely due to the large episode order, but I still enjoyed this season. Season 4 is much shorter, so I'll see how that turns out."
