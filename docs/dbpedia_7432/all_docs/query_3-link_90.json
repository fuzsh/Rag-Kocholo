Bell. I was a huge fan of Animaniacs, but as I read the CRGA, I began to realize that I had been missing many jokes which had previously gone 'over my head', because I was unaware of the references that had been made. Watching the episodes again after having read the CRGA gave the series a whole new level of humor, and I began to appreciate the show even more. Which brings me to the present day, and to this document. Pinky and the Brain, a spin-off series from Animaniacs, contains just as many, if not more, references to present day culture. Movies, celebrities, politicians -- all are a target of the brilliant wit of those responsible for creating each episode of Pinky and the Brain. As I was so impressed with the efforts of Will Bell, and what his CRGA has done for me, and millions of other fans such as myself, I have decided to continue the tradition by creating and maintaining this Cultural Reference Guide to Pinky and the Brain. I hope you will enjoy it. Many of the references within this guide are taken from the newsgroup alt.tv.animaniacs. If you wish for your comments to be anonymized, or excluded from this guide, please notify me via e-mail. Please forgive references which you may see as \"too obvious\". Remember, this is a show which is seen in many different countries, and by many different age groups. So, those references which may be obvious to you may not necessarily be obvious to all. Also, those references which are obvious today, may not be obvious to future generations. On a final additional note, if you would like to find out more information on a particular reference featured in this guide, you will want to check out Mark Elbrecht's companion guide to the BRAIN, known as P.I.N.K.Y. (Packaged Informational Nuggets with Knowledgable Yakking). The PINKY expands on this document by providing hypertext links to web sites containing further information on the references found here and can be found at: http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/1420/index.html NOTE: The basic format of this document follows that of Will B. Bell's Cultural Reference Guide to Animaniacs (CRGA). I have simplified the symbols used by eliminating the verified/unverified symbols. I do not have the time to verify every reference myself, so I am relying on an honor system of sorts. If it is discovered that a person is submitting false references purposely, I will not accept further references from that person. See the rules for submission to the BRAIN for further details on submission policy. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GUIDE TO SYMBOLS: + == A true reference, verified by myself or based on convincing arguments. - == Random observations, DYN's, and other thoughts which may not be actual cultural references -- but I liked them and I put them in. DYN == \"Did you notice?\" Points out brief appearances that might be missed or overlooked at first glance. NIT == Nit-picking. Pointing out small inconsistencies or inaccuracies in a scene. Always a favorite around a.t.a. * == Preceding a line indicates material found in the Cultural Reference Guide for Animaniacs (CRGA) (C) 1993, 1994 by Will B. Bell and is reprinted with his permission. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTRIBUTORS: Reference contributions are noted with initials following the reference. For a complete list of contributors, see the final section of the reference guide (Appendix B). Thanks to all for your help! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And now... the let the references begin! ================================================================================ GENERAL INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION: + Notes found on the Brain's blackboard during the title sequence: . The Theory of Everything Made simple: This is the Brain's version of the Grand Unification Theory, the \"holy grail\" of physics. It explains absolutely EVERYTHING about the universe, and Brain has solved it while no human has yet come close! (Skel) . BH-91210: A reference (with incorrect zip code) to the Aaron Spelling produced show, \"Beverly Hills, 90210\". (Skel) . THX-1138: Brain's solution to the formula is actually the title of a George Lucas student film from his days at UCLA. The title has made it's way, in one form or another, into almost every film he's ever done, as well as other Lucasfilm projects (THX Soundsystems, for example). It has also shown up often on Animaniacs, Tiny Toons, and Pinky and the Brain before. Best guess is that it's part homage to Lucas's contribution to entertainment this half of the century, and part reference to (Exec. Producer) Steven Speilberg and Lucas' long standing, close friendship. (Skel) + Many have noticed the hidden words in the title song. Here is the list of exactly what appears (besides the lyrics) in the order which they appear, with some comments in parenthesis: (BN) . PLH (Producer's initials - Peter Livingston Hastings, who incidentally is the one responsible for putting the flying lyrics and hidden messages into the title song.) . enasni (Why, that's \"insane\" in a mirror! NARF!) . Don't tell Brain I hid this secret message. Ha Ha Narf! . Poit! . ARE YOU PONDERING WHAT I'M PONDERING? . I know about your silly secret message. Pinky. . ZORT + According to Rob Paulsen, Pinky's accent is British with a speech impediment. The way he explained it was that, when he first saw a drawing of Pinky, he thought those huge front teeth would cause a speech impediment. Then he decided that that would offend too many people who really did have speech impediments, so, being a Monty Python fan, he cranked in a British accent...and the result is the voice we know and ...er... love. (JM) * + The Brain's voice is supposed to be a parody of Orson Welles's voice * cf. \"War of the Worlds\". As well, the facial features of The Brain * and the older Welles are pretty similar, too. (AS, MF) + According to a radio interview with Maurice LaMarche: He said that when he saw the early model sheets of the Brain, he immediately thought of Orson Welles, and did a straight Welles imitation for the voice. It was decided later that that voice was a little too flat, so Moe added a touch of Vincent Price and a dab of Peter Lorre to come up with the voice we hear now. * + The genesis of \"NARF\" was that TTA director & storyboard artist Eddie * Fitzgerald *did* and does say that particular thing...though personally * I always heard it as \"neff!\". Further, \"Pinky\" started out as a * mouse-caricature of Mr. Fitzgerald, though through various redesigns * it's morphed a bit afield from him. (AS) - It's a slight possibility that \"NARF\" may be based on the imperative form of the German verb \"to annoy\". Used in the imperative the verb becomes \"nerv\", such as, \"Do I annoy you?\" == \"Nerv ich dich?\". The 'e' in \"nerv\" is pronounced like the 'e' in when. Which may explain why Eddie Fitzgerald sounded like he was saying \"neff\". (TorK, BN) + The Brain was also modeled after a WBA employee, writer and producer Tom Minton. (BN) + According to Peter Hastings, in the original drawings, both Pinky and the Brain wore lab coats, and Pinky wore glasses. (BN) ================================================================================ Episode: 1 \"Das Mouse\" -- + The title refers to \"Das Boot\" a 1981 German film about a German U-Boat. The captain might be the same captain that Jack refers to when he takes out the nautilus. (BC) + This particular episode is a spoof of the technothriller genre, specifically \"The Hunt For Red October\" (book & movie - 1990), and \"Raise The Titanic!\" (also book & movie - 1980). \"Jack Maguire\" is a loose composite of Jack Ryan, from tHfRO, and Dirk Pitt, from RtT. Brain's plan for raising the Titanic is roughly identical to the one used in RtT. In addition, the Titanic which Brain finds resembles the depiction of the Titanic in RtT -- the book/film version was intact save for a lost second funnel. (JW, BEC) + It was also the same technique that was used in the 1961 movie \"Mysterious Island\", to raise a sunken pirate ship so everyone could escape the island before it blew up. There was a sub in that one too - The Nautilus! Which was coincidentally the name of the 'attack path' P&tB were running. (RJR) + The Titanic, for those who don't know, was an ocean liner that sank on April 15, 1912 after striking an iceberg. 1500 died due to inadequate lifeboats. (BEC) - Brain is looking for crabs, and he may find them. The Titanic has become an oasis for life on the ocean bottom, with many fish, sponges, worms and crabs calling the wreak home. (BEC) + Poi is Polynesian staple made of mashed taro root, NOT a dessert. After tasting it, it would be very hard to mistake it for a dessert. (RY) + Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) is an actual facility located in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst., in tandem with the French university INFREMER, discovered the wreck of the Titanic in 1985. (BN, BEC) - Both WHOI and NARF are valid radio callsigns for US-registered ships, though NARF would normally be assigned only to a US Navy ship. (JM) + Woods Hole is also home to the Alvin submersible and Jason Jr. robotic probe seen in this episode, which are actual vehicles used by Bob Ballard in a 1986 exploration of the Titanic. (KP) + Alvin is really one of half dozen or so subs that are capable of diving to the Titanic's depth. NIT: Alvin must be brought into place by a support ship, as it only has about 12 hours of battery power. (BEC) + Jason Jr. was designed to be a tethered remote for Alvin, and was used during the second Woods Hole Titanic expedition in 1986, but has since been retired. Minor nit, the real JJ is blue. (BEC) - NIT: The radar transponder about the Alvin has two knobs to set the code in the scene where Pinky scrambles it, and three when they come back from the first commercial break. (JM) + Pinky's asking if he can be Queequeg is a reference to the Polynesian harpooner in Herman Melville's 1851 novel \"Moby Dick\". (JS, GJB) + Sub Club == The Club, a popular anti-theft device found on many automobile steering wheels. (BN) - The reference to the sub being able to make only right turns could be a nod to J. Edgar Hoover's alleged superstition about all things sinistral. He was purported to have believed that left turns were bad luck, and his chauffeurs would often travel incredibly circuitous routes to reach places that could have been traveled in minutes using left turns. (ALS) + Pinky quotes a line from Baywatch. Baywatch is a popular syndicated program whose plot centers around showing as many beautiful female and male lifeguards running around the beach in skimpy swimsuits as possible in one hour. (BN) + The book Brain was reading: Jackie Collyns' OXNARD. Check out any bookstore for the cultural ref. on this Jackie Collins novel. (RJR) + \"Oxnard\" is a real community in Ventura County, California. I imagine that some of the WB staff probably lives in the area, since it's about 45 minutes from Burbank. (BEC) + Brain mentions \"The Stud,\" a 1978 movie starring Joan Collins (Jackie's sister) which was just as trashy as the Jackie Collins novel which it was based upon. (AV) - DYN: The phrases on the soft-drink machine: \"CloakaCola machine\" and \"Taste the dagger\". (ME) + DYN: Jack's line \"Hold on to your Newton, desk jockey\". The Newton is a popular P.D.A. made by Apple Computer Inc.. The Newton is basically a hand-held communications device with several functions, and was most notable during its debut in June 1993 for its ability to translate handwriting into typewritten text. (ME, DCat, BN) + Cheez-Whiz is a processed cheese product in a can. (ME) + Jacques Cousteau, who died late June 1997, was the oceanographer whose television series \"The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau\" and other works (including co-inventing the equipment we now know as \"SCUBA\" gear for the military) made him famous, and at the same time showed the wonders to be found under the sea. (ME, chance) + \"Davy Jones' locker\" is a mariner's term for the bottom of the sea, also used as a maritime colloquialism for the final resting place of deceased mariners. (ME, chance) + Davy Jones did sing co-lead for the Monkees along with Mickey Dolenz. Sidenote: David Bowie's real name is David Jones; he changed it to Bowie to avoid confusion. (BC) + When Jason Jr. goes past the bow of the ship, it is very reminiscent of the cover of Dr. Robert Ballards (WHOI expedition leader) book \"Discovery of the Titanic\" which shows a painting of JJ next to Titanic's bow. (BEC) + The large, curved stairway that is shown briefly as the airbag is filling was Titanic's First Class Entrance. The real stairwell is gone, destroyed after the sinking. (BEC) + Brain's \"Rise and be free\" sequence is a reference to a famous scene from the 1993 movie \"Free Willy\". (BN) + While Brain was raising it, the Titanic breaks in two; when in fact, she broke in two major portions while sinking, in about the place indicated, with the two portions being about 1/2 mile apart. (This is similar to a \"cartoon character knocks over Leaning Tower of Pisa\" joke you sometimes see.) (JW, BEC) - NIT - The Titanic in the cartoon had a big gash on the front of the ship, but it was on the wrong side! (JW) - NIT 2 - When Brain first shows Pinky a picture of the Titanic on the computer, it has just three funnels, the Titanic had four. Also, when they get to the actual ship, the funnels are still intact, they were ripped off and/or imploded when it sank. (KP) - Ah, but if you look closely, you'll see a gap where the fourth funnel would go. If I recall correctly, this is how the Titanic was depicted in \"Raise The Titanic!\". (Besides, she *really* only had 3 funnels; the fourth was a dummy, added solely for appearances.) (JW) ================================================================================ Episode: 2 \"Of Mouse and Man\" -- + The title refers to the title of John Steinbeck's 1937 novel \"Of Mice and Man\" about two farm workers who desire a small farm of their own. (See also -- CRGA entry for \"Of Nice and Man\"). (BN) - \"There must be a way to get this money without running for Congress.\" The original airing of this episode had \"working for Eisner\" (after Walt Disney chairman and chief executive Michael Eisner) in place of \"running for Congress\". All subsequent airings were changed for unknown reasons. (BN) + Gerald Ford pardon refers to the 38th President of the United States' controversial pardon of resigned President Richard Nixon for all federal crimes he might have committed in office [referring to the Watergate incident]. (BN) - \"We're looking for someone who has no life.\": Has to do with the fact that some employers assume that if you are not married with children that you can (and will) devote all your time and effort to your job, being more productive, and increasing revenues. They look on family as something that will distract you. They also don't have to provide benefits to your family members, which also costs money. It's not legal to ask questions about marital status during an interview. (HB) + Gallagher is a comedian who at the height of his popularity (late 1970's) would appear on variety shows (The Muppet Show comes to mind). One of the parts of his act was smashing fruit, usually watermelons, with a sledgehammer. The audience would come with plastic sheeting or rain gear in order to shield themselves. (BC) + \"American Gladiators\" is a game-show style television program in which contestants put themselves through various physical events against the program's own 'gladiators'. (BN) - The cubicles in the office are patterned after the WBA cubicles (seen previously in TTA's \"Toons Take Over\") right down to the coloring. (BC) - When the crowd looks into Brain after his \"accident\", the man in the upper right hand corner is WBA director/writer Audu Paden! (BC) + The counselor for the insurance company was a parody of actor Christopher Walken. (RKM) + The judge is Judge Lance Ito, the judge of the now infamous O.J. Simpson criminal trial. (BN) + Court TV is a cable television which covers various court cases, and became extremely popular during the aforementioned O.J. Simpson trial. (BN) - DYN - In the vending machine, Pinky is placed in front of \"Ruegger Bars\". (Named after Senior Producer Tom Ruegger) Partially obscured to the left of them appears to be a candy bar called Spumco. (Named after the people who made the first season of Ren & Stimpy.) (BN, RO) ================================================================================ Episode: 3 \"Tokyo Grows\" -- - The title probably refers to Tokyo Rose, a Japanese propagandist during World War II. She hosted a radio show that tried to demoralize Allied troops. It was so poorly done, it had almost the opposite effect. (JR) + There actually was never a Tokyo Rose. The name was an invention of U.S. GI's serving in the Pacific. The name was attributed to any female voice coming out of Tokyo. No one knows where it came from, but it was in use by the end of 1942. The young girl who is attributed to Tokyo Rose actually used a radio name of \"Ann\" or \"Orphan Ann\" (her real name escapes me), and she was one of many young women to do broadcasts from Tokyo. She had the rather bad misfortune to be a U.S. citizen, and was convicted of being a traitor after the war, and stripped of her citizenship (she was a natural born American). She was eventually pardoned by Gerald Ford. (BEC) + Iva Ikuko Toguri was the woman who, at age 27, broadcast as \"Orphan Ann\" on the Allied POW-produced ZERO HOUR program on Radio Tokyo. (DND) - NIT: Error right off the bat. The graphic writes Tokyo incorrectly. Firstly, it would be best written in kanji. Secondly, if it were to be spelled out, it should read what gets romanized as 'Toukyou'. Instead, on the screen it is written 'Toukiyou'. The difference is a more subtle one than you might think. The symbols are all correct, but the 'yo' symbol should be written smaller. (RO) - \"Acmeshita Labs\": It was probably based on Matsushita, which might be considered a real-life equivalent of Acme Corp. Matsushita, under one brand or another, could probably match Acme gadget-for-gadget. (BM) - NIT: The scientist going into Acmeshita Labs takes his shoes off before entering the lab, but as soon as the radio sounds that Gollyzilla is coming, his shoes magically appear inside the room which he is in and he puts them on to get out of the building. (DW) + Having all the trouble start with a miniaturization ray is apt. In the 1950's and 60's, Japan was best known as an exporter of (usually cheap) electronic gadgets that used transistors to make them smaller. \"Japanese transistor radio\" was almost a redundancy. (MB) - DYN - The kanji on Pinky & the Brain's water bottle? It isn't 'water', it's \"sake\", a Japanese liquor made from fermented rice. (RO) + The footage of Raymond Burr (\"Yes, I see.\") parodies the original Godzilla movie \"Gojira\" (released in 1954 in Japan) which when it was released in America in 1956 as \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters,\" contained spliced footage of Burr. (BN) - NIT: Slight continuity error. `Sony' on a radio changes to `Fony' on another shot. (RO) + Either way, it's a reference to electronics manufacturer Sony Corporation which is headquartered in Tokyo. (LR, BN) - Most of the characters on the signs and buildings are correct hiragana and katakana characters, but the \"words\" are nonsensical. However, there are a couple of funny exceptions. Two signs when Brain is directing Pinky with the megaphone read \"Oumi o taberu\" which means eat a flea. \"Omi\" again shows up on the fruit stand when \"Brainodo\" shows up. Perhaps 'flea' == 'flee'? (BC, RO) + When the people flee from Pinkzilla, some of them are in baseball uniforms. Baseball is enormously popular in Japan. In fact, it's the only western sport to have a Japanese name: yakyuu. One of the biggest baseball stars in Japan currently is nicknamed `Gojira' (Godzilla). (RO) + On Gollyzilla taking off his sandals before entering Tokyo: One generally removes his or her shoes before entering the living area of a Japanese house. (WN) + Now for a Japan specific ref. When Godzilla is chasing after Pinky & Brain, one of the stores is named \"Sogo\". That is a name of an actual department store in Japan. Minor nit: The department store is actually based in Yokohama. (Just outside of Yokohama St. on the JR and Toyoko lines) (BC) \"That Smarts\" -- - DYN: Brain's robotic suit was on one of the log pages. (SP) + Gremlins are imaginary creatures that are blamed for causing machines to fail. (ME) + Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin were a highly successful comedy duo of the 1940's and 50's, having starred in several films together. They split up in 1956, with Jerry Lewis moving on to direct and star in his own films. (ME, BN) - NIT: The keypad on the machine when it is first shown has the numbers 1-13. Later in the episode, it only has 1-12. (JR) - DYN: The letters on the keys of Brain's machine read \"PBWS\". This could possibly stand for \"Pinky and the Brain, Warner Studios\" (BN) + Jimmy Hoffa was the leader of the Teamsters Union who disappeared in 1975. It is believed that he was kidnapped and later murdered, but his body has never been found. (ME, BN) + If you look closely at Brain's romance novel you will notice the names Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Both were writers, but the significance of pairing them together here is that Toklas was Stein's lover and companion; Stein's best-known book was 'The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas'. (RD) \"Brainstem\" -- + The tune is \"Camptown Races\" by Stephen Foster. (MB) + Brain's comment at the end of the song refers to the old blooper on those Kermit Schaeffer \"Pardon My Blooper\" records which had the old time children's radio host \"Uncle Don\" blurting out (when he thought the mic was off), \"That ought to hold the little b*stards!\" (RF) ================================================================================ Episode: 4 \"Pinky & The Fog\" -- - NIT: Unfortunately, the episode is set a little too early in the thirties. Quoting from \"TUNE IN YESTERDAY\" by John Dunning: \"The Shadow made its radio debut in August 1939 on the CBS Detective Story program.\" However at that time, the Shadow was just the host of a mystery anthology. (RN) - DYN: The radio station where \"The Mist\" is being produced is WRLD, making Brain just one letter away from taking over the world (MN) - NIT: In elevators like the one where the Brain gets flattened, the handle that moves back and forth controls the up and down movement of the elevator, not the opening and closing of the doors. Also, there were no buttons in the 1930's elevators. These types of elevators still exist in many older buildings in New York City. (DTC) - The music for The Mist was similar to the music for The Shadow. The theme for the Shadow was an organ playing Camille Saint-Saens' Omphale's Spinning Wheel. (RN) + The first radio actor is a caricature of Mel Blanc and the actor who portrayed The Mist looked a bit like Orson Welles, although he looked like a later Orson Welles than the 1937 Welles. (RN, DG) - NIT: Orson Welles did not begin playing the Shadow until 1937. (RN) \"Where No Mouse Has Gone Before\" -- + The title of the segment refers, of course, to Star Trek's opening soliloquy - \"To boldly go where no man has gone before.\" (SC) - The entire plot is very reminiscent of an episode of the Twilight Zone entitled \"Hocus, Pocus, and Frisby\". In which according to the Twilight Zone Episode Guide (http://www.twilight.com/twilight-zone.guide): \"the town windbag so impresses a visiting group of aliens (who are masquerading as humans) with his tall tales that they attempt to take him back to their planet for study as a prime Earth specimen\". (SC) + The opening shot of Brain floating up to the light is straight out of the beginning space sequence from the 1968 film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" complete with the Blue Danube Waltz. (BC) + \"One day we will live in a world where a mouse rules, and it's the humans who are forced into these humiliating diversions.\" \"You mean Orlando?\" This is a reference to Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Mickey Mouse is the mouse who rules, and the rides are the 'humiliating diversions'. (Rizz) - NIT: The seats Pinky and the Brain sit in on the centrifuge are mounted in the wrong direction to generate the effect they show. The acceleration they would experience with seats mounted facing perpendicular to the arm would be towards the outside of the circle, yet they are shown as though they are being accelerated in the direction they are facing. The centrifuges NASA used on astronauts have the seats mounted to face back along the arm; this would produce the effect we see. (JM) + The altered paintings are \"The Mona Lisa\" by Leonardo Da Vinci, \"The Blue Boy\" by Thomas Gainsborough, a Warhol print featuring Mickey Mouse (I forget the name), and of course the immortal dogs playing poker. (BC, BN) + The opera portion parodies Richard Wagner's \"Die Walkure\", also known as \"Ride of the Valkyries.\" (BN) + Brain's rock 'n' roll bit is Little Richard, complete with his pompadour, but he performs it closer to Pat Boone. The song BTW, is \"Tutti Fruitti\" (BC) + There's quite a bit of Tchaikovsky in this episode -- When Pinky asks the Brain about including ballet in the messages he is sending to the aliens, a bit of Tchaikovsky's \"THE NUTCRACKER\" plays in the background. Then when Pinky talks about the Japenese weeping at \"GISELLE\" a bit of Tchaikovsky's \"SWAN LAKE\" plays in the background. Both \"SWAN LAKE\" and \"THE NUTCRACKER\" are ballets written by Tchaikovsky. However the ballet to which Pinky refers - \"Giselle\" - was written by Adolphe-Charles Adam. Perhaps they didn't use music from this ballet because it isn't as well known as the Tchaikovsky ballets. (RN) + Verner Von Brain = Wernher Von Braun, a German scientist who came to America and had a civic center in Huntsville, AL named after him. He was also heavily involved in the early space program and is famous as the developer of the liquid-fuel rocket. (JH, BN) + Colonel Klink was a German character from the old \"Hogan's Heroes\" TV show. (JH) + When Pinky makes his remark about practicing, the background music is what is known as Kreutzer exercises, famous for tormenting hapless violin students. I believe their purpose is to practice fingering. (DG) + This strain will be readily recognized by anyone familiar with Jack Benny, as it was with this sequence that he habitually tortured his violin teacher. (DG) + The \"Philbin Space Probe\" is a reference to daytime talk show host Regis Philbin of \"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee\". Regis seems to be a popular target of the Pinky and the Brain writers. (BN) - Fronobulax was the planet that the giant poodle in the Frank Zappa song \"Cheapnis\" was from. (MAM) - The ending was very similar to the ending of another Twilight Zone episode entitled \"People Are The Same All Over.\" In which Roddy McDowall and some others take off from Earth and land on an alien planet, where they are put in a zoo. (RN) \"Cheese Roll Call\" -- + The music is the first two-thirds or so of \"Semper Fidelis\", which Sousa wrote in 1888 while he was music director of the US Marine Corps Band at the suggestion of President Chester A. Arthur. Arthur had asked Sousa what he thought of \"Hail To the Chief\", and suggested he write something else when Sousa replied that he didn't think a lot of it. \"Semper Fidelis\" was one of two compositions Sousa produced in response; the other was \"Presidential Polonaise\". \"Semper Fidelis\" was subsequently adopted as the official march of the USMC. (JM) ================================================================================ Episode: 5 \"Brainania\" -- + \"Fatty Lumpkin\" was the name of Tom Bombadil's pony in J.R. Tolkien's novel \"Fellowship of the Ring\". (JeffD) - The ending of this episode seemed rather unusual. There's a setup that ends up being ignored. Brain gives the satchel to Pinky, warning him: \"It's leather, so don't get it wet.\" It gets wet at the end, but there's no comment about the consequences. Instead, the cheque is perfectly fine, but Brain tears it up after Pinky makes a paper crane out of it. Why was this setup ignored? Only the writers would know for sure... (RO) ================================================================================ Episode: 6 \"TV or not TV\" -- + The title of the episode is from the famous soliloquy from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\". (\"To be or not to be...\") (BN) + The episode opens with Brain ripping the smile from a magazine photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford - note the distinctive mole. (BN) + The bit about \"Clutch Cargo\" and \"what do they call a Quarter Pounder in France\" are both references to the 1995 film \"Pulp Fiction\", which starred John Travolta (pictured in the cutout that Pinky is holding.) (JM, JJW) + \"Clutch Cargo\" was a 1950's low-budget cartoon where the lip movements were provided by real human mouths, superimposed on the drawings through something called \"Synchro Vox\". With the end result looking similar to what Pinky was doing with the John Travolta picture. (ME) + Pinky's favorite show, \"Mr. Belvedere\" played on ABC in the mid-1980's. It stared Bob Uecker, and was about a English butler that stayed with a rather crass family in Pittsburgh. (It was based on a rather funny character played by Clifton Webb in several '40s movies.) (BC, JJW) + Pinky and the Brain on the motorcycle is a takeoff on the 1969 film \"Easy Rider\". The background music even sounded like a variation on \"Born to Be Wild\". (RD) - Brain's alias Jamal Spelling is probably a reference to television producer Aaron Spelling (Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place, The Love Boat). (BN) - Pinky's alias, Jonathan Michael Charles, is most likely a reference to teen idol Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Note the three first names in both names. (Jackie) + Jerry Kilmer == Jamie Kellner, head of The WB Television Network. (BN) + Note the Yawni poster behind the secretary's desk. Yanni is a \"new age\" composer and musician. (BN, BC) - Is it just me, or does Kilmer's receptionist look like a young Gloria Steinem (founder of *Ms.*)? The symbol for \"woman\" on her computer, long a feminist icon as well, adds to my suspicion. Of course, for all I know, it could just be a caricature of Kellner's real-life receptionist. (ALS) + The show idea that Pinky and the Brain give to Mr. Kilmer sounds exactly like a description of the NBC sitcom \"Friends\" (although the monkey is no longer a part of the show). Ironically, \"Friends\" is produced by Warner Bros. (BN, DW) - Everyone was complaining that all the new sitcoms introduced the season in which this episode aired were clones of \"Friends\". (RN) - A minor nit - The way to get a sitcom is not to get on the cover of \"People\" Magazine. It's true that people with brilliant ideas are turned down, but it's usually because they don't have a track record of working on staff on other shows. You start out as a writer, then you get a staff position, then you get to create your own shows. It's not usually the performers who pitch, except for some writer/performers, such as Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Reiser, Roseanne, etc. (RN) + \"Peeple\" == \"People,\" a weekly magazine that has featured a cover story on Princess Diana an inordinate number of times (over 40 to date), hence Brain's plan \"B\" on how to get on the cover of the magazine. (Jackie) + In The Brain's book on comedy you see Henny Youngman's famous line: \"Take my wife - please!\" (BC) + The man with the monocle who introduces Brain at the comedy club is Bud Freidman, owner of the Improv chain of comedy clubs. (RD, RG) + \"Did you ever notice...\" is a lead-in line inextricably associated with Jerry Seinfeld. (JJW) + Star Hunt == Star Search, hosted by Ed McMahon who is caricatured here, is a program on which amateur singers, comedians, and otherwise talented people compete to win prizes. I believe several now famous celebrities were \"discovered\" from their Star Search appearances. (BN) + \"G!\" == \"E!\", a cable television station about the entertainment industry. (Jackie) + \"Howie Tern\" == Howard Stern, a radio talk show host who has his own show on \"E!\" (Jackie) + Brain makes an appearance on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\" The two men, Dave and Paul, are references to David Letterman and Paul Shaffer. (Jackie) + Paul's \"Yamahamer\" keyboard: possibly a combination of Yamaha and Jan Hammer, the synthesizer artist who did the \"Miami Vice\" theme. (BC) + We certainly do hope Bob Saget gets trampled by a bear. As the star of \"Full House\" and \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" he has helped to rot many millions of minds. (JJW) + There's also a mention of Richard Dean Anderson being shot out of a pasta maker. Richard Dean Anderson is famous for his role of MacGyver on the television show of the same name, he is also featured in the StarGate television series. (DW) - DYN: Also on the cover of \"Peeple [sic] Magazine\": \"Pauly Shore, enough already!\" Pauly Shore is an highly untalented actor who starred in such bombs as \"Encino Man\", \"Son-in-Law\" and \"Bio-Dome\". (JJW, JK) + The \"show about nothing\" description given by Pinky is one commonly attributed to NBC's hit sitcom \"Seinfeld\". (RD, BN) ================================================================================ Episode: 7 \"Napoleon Brainaparte\" -- - DYN: One of the student chefs was seen before in the incomprehensible foreign film that Dr. Scrachansniff took his date to see in the Animaniacs short \"Drive-Insane\". (Episode #53) (WY) + The glass pyramid in front of the Louvre was built in 1989 by architect I.M. Pei, amid some controversy. (JM, BN) + London Bridge is in fact located in America. Lake Havasu City, Arizona to be specific. (JM) + \"...we are the world!\" \"Are we the children?\": refers to the 1985 song \"We Are the World\", written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie which was performed by over 40 pop musicians, with all profits going to help fight world hunger. (BN) + On the use of Marlon Brando for Napoleon in this episode. Brando actually played Napoleon in the 1954 Twentieth Century Fox film entitled \"Desiree\" (Desiree was the name of one of Napoleon's mistresses). (RN) + The Napoleonic Code was the set of laws developed after the French Revolution as a protest against the diversity of laws governing France before the revolution. It was a combination of the Germanic law of northern France and the Roman law of southern and eastern France. Noted for its clearness and simplicity, the Napoleonic Code remains as the basis of law for many areas today, including the state law of Louisiana in the United States. (BN) + There is also a reference to Brando's performance in the 1951 film \"Streetcar Named Desire\" when Napoleon/Brando screams \"Josephine\" (as Brando screamed \"Stella\" in \"Streetcar\"). (HMH) ================================================================================ Episode: 8 \"Snowball\" -- + The Piggly Wiggly is a funnily-named supermarket chain. (LR) - DYN: The child's drink bottles contain Alar and DDT (pesticides), Canal No. 5 (a reference to Chanel No. 5 perfume), and Snipple (refers to Snapple soft drinks). (JM) + \"A mouse and a hamster barely alive...they said they could make us better...faster...smarter.\" refers to the opening of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\". (JM) + The cast of the NBC drama \"ER\" can be seen operating on Brain and Snowball. (BN) + \"Wink Martindale day, except in Arizona\" is a jab at that state's reluctance to adopt a Martin Luther King holiday. (JM) + Wink Martindale, by the way, is by far the cheesiest game show host ever, hosting such classics as \"Tic Tac Dough\" and \"Joker's Wild\". (BC) - DYN: Books in the lab: Quantum Hydraulics from Paden Press (director Audu Paden), something from Rm Publishers (producer Rusty Mills), something ending in -tics, and Hasting's (sic) Theorems (producer Peter Hastings). (JM, BN) + Microsponge == Microsoft, a Seattle based computer company which many people feel is trying to take over the world. Bill Grates == Bill Gates, the founder and CEO of Microsoft. He is also one of the wealthiest people in the world. (BN) - \"Snowball for Windows\": May be a reference to the SNOBOL programming language, which was developed at Bell Telephone Labs in 1962.(*) I don't know if it's still in use anywhere, but proposing a Windows version of it is just the sort of thing Pinky would do. {* From the forward of \"The SNOBOL4 Programming Language,\" R.E.Griswold, J.F.Poage, I.P.Polonsky, copyright Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. 1971, 1968. 13-815373-6 Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 70-131996} (MH) + The scene where the camera starts on the \"No Trespassing\" sign, and pans up a mountain to a lonely mansion with a single lit window, then fades to an extreme close-up on Pinky's face as he says \"Brain...\" and drops the snow globe is a direct pull from the opening scene of the 1941 film classic \"Citizen Kane\". (Kane says \"Rosebud...\", of course.) (SC) + In order to fully appreciate and understand the final scene with the sudden cut from Mt. Rushmore to Acme Labs you had to have seen the 1959 film \"North By Northwest\". Near the end of the film, Eva Marie Saint is trying (with great difficulty) to pull Cary Grant up from his precarious hanging position on the face of Mount Rushmore. As he's pulled up, there's a *really confusing* jump-cut to him pulling her up onto the train; in the space of that 1/24th of a second, she's pulled him up, they've gotten *married*, and one can only assume that all evil has been resolved and all goodness has been rewarded, and they're going to live happily ever after. Same here. (SC) - DYN: Acme Labs is located in New York City according to this episode. The envelope Brain receives at the end with the stamp money is addressed to Mr. Brain, Acme Labs, NY NY 10005. (By the way, to be even more specific, this zip code is around the Wall Street area of New York City.) (BN) ================================================================================ Episode: 9 \"A Pinky and the Brain Christmas\" -- + The airplane is a Cessna 182 on skis, more or less; it's normally a tricycle gear aircraft and this one's a taildragger, but taildragger conversions for the 182 do exist, and are primarily used in places like Alaska. (JM) - The effects of opening an airplane's door in flight are pretty accurately portrayed as well: everything gets sucked out in a hurry. (JM) + \"...although I consider myself a Jungian.\" refers to the two great schools of psychology, the other being Freudian. Karl Jung was one of Freud's early disciples, who later broke with him. (JM, RN) + \"...joining the Donner party\" refers to an ill-fated expedition to California in the mid 1800s. 87 people were snowbound in a mountain pass and they ending up resorting to cannibalism. 47 people eventually made it out alive with the assistance of rescue parties. The pass is now named after them. (True story: One of the survivors opened a restaurant.) (JM, Ary, BN, SC) - DYN: The security alarm played the first line of \"Jingle Bells\"? (JH) - The Noodle Noggin toy reminded me of something out of \"Nightmare Before Christmas\". (JH) + Pinky's comment about wanting to be a dentist: the Rankin/Bass production of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", featured an elf that befriended Rudolph; the elf was an outcast because he wanted to be a dentist. (SC) + On the wall in Santa's office is a portrait of the Abominable Snowman from \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". (BM) - DYN: When Pinky is impersonating a reindeer, the antler he is wearing looks a lot like the one Max wore in the Grinch's Christmas. (RD) + The scene in the toy factory is from the 1992 Robin Williams movie \"Toys\". (LBL) - Herschel the Hannukah Goblin is a real character from a book whose title I don't know. (LBL) - NIT: When the mice shatter The Brain's broadcasting machine on their landing to Acme Labs through the roof, the colors on the box/lever Pinky was supposed to push (\"when it turns red...\") are reversed from what they are in the next scene. (i.e., the red area is to the left and the green-yellow area's on the right.) (HG) - DYN: In the White House Christmas scene, Socks the Clinton's cat has a Newt Gingrich scratching post. The joke being that Clinton is a Democrat and Gingrich is a Republican, and they haven't exactly gotten along well together. (HG) ================================================================================ Episode: 10 \"Around the World In Eighty Narfs\" -- + This episode is based largely on the 1956 movie \"Around the World in 80 Days\" which in turn is based on the Jules Verne book of the same title. (BC) + The year in which this episode supposedly takes place (1872) is the year in which the Jules Verne book was first published. (BN) + The person that posed the challenge is based upon David Niven's character in the film: Phileas Fogg. (BC, FB) + Benjamin Disraeli *did* become the PM of England in the late 19th century (1868 & 1874-1880). (BC) + Sir Sidney = Sidney Greenstreet, with his \"by gad, sir\" catchphrase from \"The Maltese Falcon\" (1941). (JJW) + Pinky and the Brain begin their journey in a hot-air balloon, just as Niven and Cantinflas did in the movie. The music for this sequence parodies Victor Young's famous \"Around the World\" theme for the film. (JJW) + The music played during the Western chase sequence is a parody of Elmer Bernstein's theme music from the movie \"The Magnificent Seven\". (JJW) + \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show\" was the most famous of the traveling Western-themed circuses that basically acted out Cowboys-and-Indians stories for a paying audience, thus paving the way for innumerable Hollywood versions of the same legends. (JJW) ================================================================================ Episode: 11 \"Fly\" -- + The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum is located in Washington, D.C. (BN) - NIT: Brain mentions that all of the \"Ziggy\" jet fighters were sold to Iceland in 1958. Yet when we see the European scientists flying the \"Ziggy\", it has a Norwegian flag on the side of it, not an Icelandic flag. The difference is minor, both flags look similar, but the colors are reversed. (i.e. the red area of the Norwegian flag is blue on the Icelandic flag.) (BN) - The nerdy guy in mission control with the accent resembles the scientist from India, Ben (played by Fisher Stevens) from the \"Short Circut\" movies (1986, 1988). (AJC) ================================================================================ Episode: 12 \"Ambulatory Abe\" -- + Freakazoid! is another WB animated series, and is in fact set in Washington, D.C. as Pinky points out. (BN) + Edgar Bergen was a famous ventriloquist, who created several dummies, of which Charlie McCarthy was probably his most famous. (See Episode 23 - \"Brinky\" for further information.) (BN) - Actually, it is NOT true that no one today knows what Abraham Lincoln's speaking voice sounded like. Although there are no recordings (of course) there are contemporary descriptions. According to several descriptions from people who heard his voice, it was rather high pitched -- nothing at all like Tony Danza's voice. (RN) + The little boy having his grandfather read the Lincoln Memorial inscription is a direct cinematic reference to Frank Capra's \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), and was so listed in the published script. (TM) - NIT - The inscription behind the Lincoln statue reads: \"In this temple, as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever.\" It is not, as the child reads, the Gettysburg Address. The Gettysburg Address is found in the south chamber of the memorial. (BN) - What the heck is that black thing peeking out in the lower right hand corner when the tourist asks the statue who his vice president was? Is it Yakko after playing in a coal mine? (RO) + Tony Danza is an actor most famous for his roles in the late 1970-80 sitcoms \"Taxi\" and \"Who's the Boss?\". (BN) - What is it with race cars in these cartoons that they have to look like 1971 Indycars? (RO) + Brain's comment, while hosting the Academy Awards, about one-armed push-ups, refers to the feat performed by Jack Palance at the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony. (BN) + The character introducing the 135-year old man is a caricature of Today show weatherman Willard Scott, noted for giving on-air birthday wishes to those over 100 years old. (BN) + Louis Armstrong, nicknamed Satchmo, is considered to be one of the most influential figures in jazz history as a trumpet player and vocalist. His voice is famous for being gravely. (BN, RO) \"Mouse of La Mancha\" -- + The title is based upon the 1966 Broadway musical \"Man of La Mancha\", which was based on the Miguel de Cervantes novel \"The History of Don Quixote de la Mancha\" or better known as simply \"Don Quixote\". (BN) - NIT - The punning doorman mentions that \"It must be winter, the knights (nights) are getting shorter\". But, in the winter, the nights get longer, not shorter. (BN) + \"Why would Sophia Loren do a musical?\" refers to her role as Aldonza in the 1972 film version of \"Man of La Mancha\", which was a box office failure. (BN) + The punning gatekeeper tells Brain \"don't work blue\". \"Blue\" was a term derived from the blue lighting that was used in certain female dance acts. It definitely goes back a ways -- perhaps well back into the 19th century. So the shows became known as \"blue shows\" and of course as always the term took on a life of its own, and when motion pictures came around, it was adapted for \"blue movies\" and so on, and then got bent around to being used just to describe naughty language, rather than actual naughty acts. In this case, the phrase means don't use dirty words and sexual or scatological humor in your standup routine. (RD, RO) + The phrase \"don't work blue\" was what Milton Berle says to Lenny Bruce in the 1974 film \"Lenny\". (GJB) + The scenes shown during the final song are scenes from the following episodes (NOTE - The animation is not the same as in the original sequences): (RO, BC) . A set of plans from `Where Rodents Dare'. . The plans for pretending to be Jimmy Hoffa from `That Smarts'. . Running into the time machine from `When Mice Ruled the Earth'. . Leaving the lab in his mechanical suit from `Win Big'. . Pinky running on the globe from `Jockey For Position'. . Infiltrating the summit from `Where Rodents Dare'. . Changing into a monster from `Brain Meets Brawn'. . Confronting the guard from `Where No Mouse Has Gone Before'. . Climbing the mountain from `Where Rodents Dare'. . Getting tomatoed from `Meet John Brain'. . Sitting on his throne from `Where No Mouse Has Gone Before'. . Writing on a piece of paper with a makeshift crossbow behind him, from 'Win Big'. + \"What are we going to do tomorrow night, Brain? Brigadoon?\": BRIGADOON is a 1947 musical by Lerner & Loewe. Apparently Pinky has developed a taste for classic Broadway. (JJW) ================================================================================ Episode: 13 \"The Third Mouse\" -- + The title and various plot elements (including the zither music) are taken from the 1949 film \"The Third Man\". (BN) + It should also be noted that, aside from the plot, many of the characters are also brought over from the original movie, including the British army officer and his sidekick, the two slightly sinister ci-devant aristocrats, the elderly Vienna native who is done in, the Mysterious Woman, Pinky's riff on Joe Cotten's role, and, naturally, Moe LaMarche having great fun as Harry Lime/Orson Welles. Note the fact that, like the original, the cartoon was rendered in black and white. (The credits sequence is also very well done and a faithful spoof of the original.) (EOC) + Rueggerstrasse - named after Senior Producer Tom Ruegger. (BN) - The hotel clerk's speech, where he tries to explain that Herr Brain is dead, may refer to the Monty Python \"Dead Parrot\" sketch, which contains a similar string of synonyms for \"dead.\" (JJW) - When Trudy asked Pinky \"Why? What do you know?\", he said \"the lyrics to Yakko's World\", a reference to Rob Paulsen (voice of Pinky) also voicing Yakko on Animaniacs. (JO) + Note the wacky camera angle when the Major says \"will you come with me, please?\" just before the end of act 1. In \"The Third Man\", director Carol Reed set up many shots where he tilted the camera to increase the sinister atmosphere. (JJW) - Pinky's girlfriend Phar FigNewton seen again in photograph. (See \"Jockey for Position\") (BN) + The waving Dot is of course Dot Warner from Animaniacs. + Brain's speech about Switzerland and Italy parodies Welles' famous speech from the film, where he points out that Italy, with centuries of murder and bloodshed, produced great Renaissance art, while Switzerland, with centuries of brotherly love, produced only the cuckoo clock. (JJW) + \"Heidi\" is the classic children's story by Johanna Spryi. The story has been adapted several times for movies and television. (ME) \"The Visit\" -- + Young kids (kindergartners, etc...) are given 'time-outs' as punishment. Basically they have to sit in a corner for a pre-set amount of time. (DN) + Strictly speaking, a time-out is not a punishment. It's meant as a recognition that kids sometimes get excited and do things in the heat of the moment that they wouldn't do on calm reflection, and provides time for that to happen without allowing the situation to escalate meanwhile. To say \"Do you want a time-out?\" in the tone used by Brain's dad is a distortion of the concept. (BHar) - Another distortion of concept is found in the line \"Don't make me separate you.\" A term usually used on two (or more) bickering siblings which sounds like an overly painful punishment when directed towards a single person. (BN) - The \"time-out\" gag seems to be popular at WB; it was also used in \"The Island of Dr. Mystico\" in Freakazoid! (EOC) + Al Gore is the 45th vice president of the United States (BN) - Great opportunity missed: Brain should of referred to his mother as Desiree. (From \"Pavlov's Mice\") (BC) + Broderick Crawford, referred to by Brain's Dad, was an actor noted for playing gangsters and villainous cowboys in several B films, and an Oscar winning performance in the 1949 film \"All the King's Men\". (BN) + Wolfgang Puck owns many restaurants but most notably the hip-and-trendy Spago in Los Angeles. (ME) + The courier service used to ship Brain's folks to Florida, \"Fed Up\" is of course a parody of \"Fed Ex,\" the popular nickname for Federal Express, a leading courier service. (EOC) ================================================================================ Episode: 14 \"It's Only a Paper World\" -- + The milk ad slogan that Pinky can't seem to remember is \"Got Milk?\", from a popular series of advertisements of the late 1990's sponsored by America's Dairy Farmers. (BN) - Rob Paulsen (Pinky) actually did a voice over in one of the \"Got Milk?\" commercials. He was the voice of the radio announcer in the \"Who shot Alexander Hamilton?\" commercial. (KL) + Seen on the blackboard of Acme Labs: . CHAKA -- this was the mark of a tagger who scrawled the said word in some 18,000+ various places in Southern California between the years of 1991-94. (KL) . KISS RULES -- KISS is the rock band whose painted faces helped them rise to fame in the mid 1970s. (ME) + Happy Bob the Painter (the painter on the television Pinky is imitating) is a parody of the late Bob Ross and his \"Joy of Painting\" program. He frequently used the words \"happy little\" in his descriptions of things in nature as he painted. (ME) + Paul Anka is a singer and songwriter who had several big hits during the late 1950s and early '60s. He wrote \"My Way\", one of Frank Sinatra's biggest hits, and the Johnny Carson-era theme for \"The Tonight Show\". (ME) + Carrot Top is the red-haired comedian who relies heavily on props for his laughs. (ME) + Jaime \"Klinger\" Farr, played the role of Klinger on the 1972-83 television series M*A*S*H. (BN) + The woman on the television creating various crafts is a parody of famous 'how-to' woman Martha Stewart and her television program \"Martha Stewart Living\". (BN) + Art Buchwald is a writer who won a lawsuit against Paramout Pictures for plagarizing his idea for the movie \"Coming To America\" which he had submitted to them. (ME) + \"Two, two, two earths in one,\" is a reference to the slogan for Certs breath mints -- \"Two, two, two mints in one.\" (BN) + \"The Wayans Brothers\" is (what passes for) a sitcom on the WB Network. (ME) + Regis Philbin is the co-host of \"Live With Regis and Kathie Lee\", a successful morning show in the U.S. (ME) - DYN - One scene shows one paper quite clearly, as the \"Cleve[land] Plain Dealer\" (the 'land' is not in there as its currently being ripped up). Of course, the Cleveland Plain Dealer *is* a real paper (the only paper for the Cleveland area actually). The first word, \"Browns\" can be clearly read, but I can't make out the rest. This easily appears to be a ref to the recent move of the football team to Baltimore from Cleveland. (MN) - The briefest snatch of the Animaniacs short \"Variety Speak\" when Pinky is putting strips of the paper back together, as that newspaper was one which appeared in \"Variety Speak\". (DG, RO) + Pinky thinks that a fresco is a can of carbonated soda. He is probably confusing it with \"Fresca\". (BN) + Pinky's sphinx looks surprisingly like Jim Davis' Garfield character. (BN) + Brain's comment, \"You are a fist full of stupidity!\" is a reference to the 1964 movie \"Fist Full of Dollars\". (ME) + \"Our basketball players more Mike like!\" is a reference to basketball superstar Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and a 1990's series of ads for the sports drink Gatorade which encouraged us to drink their product to \"Be Like Mike\". (ME, BN) + The name \"Chia Earth\" is borrowed from \"Chia Pets\" (and various other derivatives such as \"Chia Head\"), animal-shaped clay objects on which you grow chia (a grass-like substance). The chia seeds sprout and grow. (ME) + The \"Trademark, Brain? -- Yes, Pinky, trademark\" gag was used on the Pinky and the Brain \"You Will Buy This Video\" video. (DG) + \"Dollywood\" is a theme park in mountains of east Tennessee owned by country-western singer/songwriter/actress Dolly Parton. (ME, BN) - There is a character in the stock exchange scene that looks exactly like Wakko's barber from the Animaniacs short \"Boot Camping\" (who incidentally is a caricature of Floyd Lawson -- see CRGA for further reference) (BN) + The \"fists of fury\" comment is taken from the 1971 Bruce Lee movie known in the U.S.A as \"Fists of Fury\" but known to the rest of the world as \"The Big Boss\". (ME) + Late night talk show host David Letterman is depicted doing his famous top ten list. (ME) + President Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives are playing with boxing nuns. (ME) + Quentin Tarantino is the writer/director who became famous as the man who directed the movie \"Pulp Fiction\". (ME) + Notice in the White House a \"Presidenting for Dummies\" book. This is a parody of the famous \"For Dummies\" series from IDG books, which began with a series of computer titles, but has since branched out into other topics. (BN) + Amy Carter is the daughter of former President Jimmy Carter. (ME) + Xuxa is a Brazilian children's show host who had a show on the Family Channel, she is also well known world wide for her children's records. (JK, ME) + Pinky sings a tune from a commercial for \"King Vitamin\", a classic cereal (which apparently is still in production) from Quaker Oats. This particular commercial jingle aired sometime in the 1950-60's. (ME, BN) + The sequence with the world monuments exploding parodies a similar scene from the 1996 film \"Independence Day\". (BN) - DYN - Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 (From the New World), 1st and 2nd movements, was used extensively in this episode. Nice musical selection considering Pinky and the Brain were creating a \"New World\". (BT) - Why did Pinky use his 'alternate' sayings \"fjord\" and \"troz\"? A subtle reference to the alternate earth? (DG) ================================================================================ Episode: 15 \"Collect 'Em All\" -- + Johann Gutenberg is credited with producing the first work using movable type in 1455, in Mainz, Germany -- the first item was the so-called \"42-line Bible.\" Actually, it's probable that his financial backer, Johann Fust, and another printer, Peter Schoeffer, probably did most of the work. (EOC) + Police Academy 4 was the last Police Academy film in which Steve Guttenberg played the role of Mahoney. (JK) - \"Girlie calendars I printed for the blacksmith shops\" is probably a reference to those calendars featuring female models in skimpy clothes holding tools, posing with automobiles, or both. (ME) \"Pinkasso\" -- + Brain's attempt to start a \"Donutism\" movement isn't as farfetched as people might think. Contemporary American painter Wayne Thiebaud made a name for himself in the Pop Art era with paintings of cakes, pies, hot dogs, and similar iconographic American foodstuffs. His work is still sought after today. (ALS) + \"Two noses up\" parodies movie critics Siskel and Ebert's famous way of making movie recommendations, two thumbs up. (ME) + Lenny and Squiggy were characters from the TV shows \"Happy Days\" and \"Laverne and Shirley\". (JK) + \"15 minutes of fame\" is the compact version of Andy Warhol's famous saying: \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\" (ME) + The Macarena was a popular, but short-lived dance craze of 1996. (JK) - DYN - Dot Warner admiring one of \"Pinkasso's\" paintings. (RB) - Wakko and Yakko were there too, though Yakko is visible only for a fraction of a second before a foreground extra obscures him. (RO) - DYN - when the Brain was claiming to be Robert Del Monte, he was holding a pen in his right hand? Bob Dole is known for holding a pen in his right hand because of a war wound, he carries the pen so that people will not extend their right hands to shake his. The pen serves as a reminder to people that the hand is occupied. (RN, RKM) - Not to mention the fact that \"Del Monte\" cans fruit, just as \"Dole\" does. (RB) + The background music for the scenes in the art gallery comes from \"Pictures At An Exhibition\" by Mussorgsky. (BKH) - About the machines that mass produce thousands of Pinkasso \"originals\": painter Salvador Dali has long fought rumors that many of his works have been \"ghosted\" by uncredited assistants. (\"Master\" painters in earlier centuries often used assistants, but the practice isn't as widely accepted in the modern era.) (ALS) + One of the bidders holds up a card which reads 839: this refers to the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists union, local 839 that represents cartoonists in the Los Angeles area. (ME) ================================================================================ Episode: 16 \"Plan Brain from Outer Space\" -- + The title is, of course, a reference to the infamous Ed Wood sci-fi flick \"Plan Nine from Outer Space\" (1959). It, along with \"Heaven's Gate,\" is a virtual synonym for bad movie making. (EOC) + The Z Files == The X Files, a popular Fox show about two FBI agents who investigate cases involving supernatural incidents. (JK) + Xuxa is mentioned again (see Epsiode #14) + Lard Copy == Hard Copy, a news show that goes beyond the headlines to get the news. (JK) + Roswell is a city in New Mexico that is believed to be home of one of the most popular alien cover-ups of all time. (JK) + Area 51 is the place that is rumored to hold the aliens of the Roswell incident. It is also, as the \"ufologists\" claim, where aliens routinely land and/or where the government test-flies craft built with alien technology. (JK, RO) + The guard at Area 51 is a caricature of Gomer Pyle. (JK) + \"Hangar 18\" was a 1980 movie about government folks capturing and concealing an alien craft. (RO) + Conflicting reports about the 'non-movie' Hangar 18, so I'll list both: . After the Roswell incident, there was another, less publicized crash (supposedly) in Nevada. What with Area 51 being so close by, the AAF, according to ufologists, scooped up the bodies and the ship, and put them in Hangar 18 of the base. (JFL) . Hangar 18 is at Wright-Patterson A.F.B. in Dayton, Ohio and is where the remains of the aliens were/are(?) stored. (ME) + Generals Jones and Maltese == Looney Tunes director Chuck Jones and his favorite writer, Michael Maltese. (RB) + A nod to the legend that Walt Disney is cryogenically frozen (he actually went the other route; he was cremated). I wonder what the \"68\" stands for; can't be the year he died, since that was 1966. Perhaps it's the year of, ahem, \"acquisition.\" (EOC) + The song the major alien sang while looking for Brain parodies the classic jingle of Oscar Myer bologna. (JK) + \"I'm Not the President, I'm Also a Client\" is the famous catch phrase of the Hair Club for Men. (JK) - Other Hangar 18 occupants include: . Bigfoot . Elvis - Famous American rock-and-roll singer, died August 16, 1977. However, many believed him to have faked his death, and that he still lives on today. (See numerous K-Mart sightings of Elvis in your local tabloids.) (BN) . Jimmy Hoffa - Former leader of the Teamsters Union, rumored to have been associated with organized crime. He disappeared in 1975 and is believed to have been kidnapped and murdered. (Some rumors exist that the burial site is in the end-zone of Giants' stadium in New Jersey.) (BN) . Gov't Cheese . Ark of the Covenant - probably in reference to the 1981 film \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", where the last seen shows a lowly mover stowing the Ark away in a gigantic warehouse. (MN) - Interesting point: The comic PatB #6, with the same title as this episode, came out the week immediately after the first airing of this. This was unintentional, and purely coincidence on the part of WBA and WBWP, according to Robert Graff. The comic story bears no resemblance to the story in this episode. (MN) ================================================================================ Episode: 17 \"The Mummy\" -- + The plot of this episode is based on the work German researcher Rudolf Gantenbrink. He headed a team that explored an air shaft 8 inches square in the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, using a remote controlled probe named UPUAUT. On March 22, 1993, 210 feet into this air duct, a miniature stone door was found. As of this writing, it is still unknown as to exactly what lies beyond that door. (BN) + It also appears that this short also in part parodies the 1959 horror film \"The Mummy\". In the film archaeologists are warned against desecrating the tomb of Egyptian Princess Ananka. The character who warns the archaeologists in this short resembles Peter Cushing who I believe played a similar role in the film. (The voice credits list \"Cushing\" as one of the characters in the short.) (BN) + The Rolling Stones is a rock group that became famous in the 1960's. (ME) - NIT: In one scene, Egypt is spelled Egyt. (ME) + Space Mountain is roller coaster at the Disney theme parks which, like most roller coasters, have a height requirement. (ME) + \"Early in the morn-ing\" and the way it's sung are taken from the sea chantey \"What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor\". (EOC) - DYN - Signs the protesters are carrying: (ME) . Mummies are people too! . Meat is murder . My mommy was a mummy . I love Khufu! . I'm KooKoo for Khufu + The Olsen twins (Mary-Kate and Ashley) are known for their role as Michelle on the 1980's sitcom \"Full House\". They have made several, less than impressive TV and made-for-video movies in which they solve mysteries. (BN) - DYN - Martin Sheen as one of the protesters. (The one who apologizes to Pinky and the Brain for their treatment.) Notice his button, Sheen has been arrested several times during anti-nuclear demonstrations. (RN, BN) + Marco Polo is a game played in pools or large hot tubs where a blindfolded individual has to try to listen for another player to respond to \"Marco\" with \"Polo\" and then attemp to tag or grab hold of the speaker. (RO) \"Robin Brain\" -- + Kevin Costner with an English accent refers to \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\", a 1991 film starring Kevin Costner as the title character. (JK) + The camera following the arrow flight is also borrowed from \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\". (EOC) + Friar Chuck == Friar Tuck, one of Robin Hood's merry men. (JK) + The diamond log joke refers to the fact that many California highways and freeways have what is called a \"Diamond Lane\". The left lane is marked with diamonds painted every so often in the lane. This lane is reserved for cars with two or more passengers. If you're caught driving solo in the Diamond Lane, you have to pay a large fine. It's supposed to encourage car pooling. Many metropolitan areas have similar lanes known as HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) lanes. (RM, RN, KW) - NIT: The quarterstaff battle was between Robin Hood and Little John, not between Robin and the Friar (or Fryer, in this case). (BN) + The Mighty Mallards == The Mighty Ducks, a Disney-owned hockey team named after the 1992 sleeper hit. (JK) + Note Brain's use of Peter Finch's \"mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\" speech from the movie \"Network\" (a role, as mad anchorman Howard Beale, for which he won a posthumous Oscar). (EOC) + There was also one subtle joke, in the exchange between Robin Hood and Brain; Robin Hood notes that Brain is smaller than he appears in his posters, and Brain makes a similar comment back to Robin Hood. Errol Flynn, who played Robin Hood in the 1938 film version (and who seems to be the model for this version) was notoriously sensitive about his height, and relative lack thereof. (EOC) - DYN - that all of Pinky's usual sayings had been appended with 'th'..for example \"Zortth\" \"Narfth\", etc, to make them sound Old English-like. (MN) ================================================================================ Episode: 18 \"The Pink Candidate\" -- + The opening shot of Dole and Kemp refers to Circus of the Stars, a event seen on CBS between Thanksgiving and Christmas which has celebrities perform circus acts. (JK) + The host of the circus, Anson \"Stop Calling Me Pottsy\" Williams, is probably best known for his role as Pottsy in the 1970's sitcom \"Happy Days\". (BN) + \"The Family Circus\" is a popular one panel comic strip written by Bil Keane about family life from the view of a child. (JK) + To further the Bil Keane reference: When the newspaper reports that Keane has gone on vacation and \"Billy\" is filling in for him, it refers to the fact that on occasion, Keane will draw \"The Family Circus\" in a childish style and say it was drawn by Billy, the oldest child in the family, while Keane takes the day off. (RD) + The scene with the Meryl Streep caricature with her back to her boring husband, looking out into the garden at the Clint Eastwood character is a reference to the 1995 film \"Bridges of Madison County\" (JJW) - Missing on the back cover of Time magazine: B. CALDWELL ALIAS S.B. ELF. The reference here is to (Annie Award winning) storyboard artist Barry Caldwell. According to lore, Barry Caldwell is often not to be found in the animation studio. Nobody ever sees him, and when he's there, his door is closed....but, just when you think he's not doing anything, there, on his desk, are a bunch of story board (\"S.B.\") pages that he did sometime, somewhere, like a little elf in the night. - NIT: While the Green Party is certainly no force in U.S. politics, they are gaining power and influence in Europe, particularly Germany. (RD) + The other member of Pinky's party is James Carville; Carville is, of course, famed as Clinton's 1992 guru. (RB) - Here is the list of candidates in the polls when first announced in the episode: (JK, RD) . Bill Clinton . Pinky . Pat Paulsen - first became famous with his appearances on the Smothers Brothers show, and ran for President several times, most recently 1996. He never expected to win, but running did give him publicity and the chance to joke and comment on the political scene. He never expected to win, but running did give him publicity and the chance to joke and comment on the political scene. . The Trix Rabbit . Bob Dole + \"You just might be a redneck\" is comedian Jeff Foxworthy's famous quote. (JK) + Tiger Beet == Tiger Beat, a magazine for teenagers. (JK) + The boat with the bimbos reference is a reference to Gary Hart's little interlude on the good ship \"Monkey Business\" in 1984 in the Florida Keys with Donna Rice. (EOC, BC) + When Pinky is called \"the Teflon candidate\", it refers to Ronald Reagan being called \"the Teflon President\", which came from people observing that no charges of wrongdoing that occurred during his tenure as President stuck to him. (RD) + The mysterious operative for the smear campaign, and his initial speech, is based on the Robert Shaw character from \"Jaws,\" the grizzled seaman who offers to go kill the shark. As usual, Richard Stone is musically equal to the reference: the music playing in the background as he speaks is the song \"Farewell and Adieu, You Fair Spanish Ladies,\" which Shaw sang incessantly throughout the shark opus. (JJW) + \"Super-sizing\", as President Clinton mentions, refers to a McDonald's deal where for 39 cents more, you can upgrade your drink and fries to a larger size. (BN) + The \"Pinky Upsets Dewey\" headline refers to the most famously inaccurate newspaper headline ever, from the 1948 presidential campaign, when one paper reported that Thomas Dewey had defeated Harry Truman. Truman held up a copy of that paper proudly when it was announced that he had won the election. (RD) + The Jerky Boys are a comedy group known for their prank telephone calls. (JK) + When Pinky asks his staff to pray with him, it refers to a similar request from Richard Nixon to (IIRC) Henry Kissinger near the end of Nixon's term as President. In addition, the final scene, with Pinky and the Brain preparing to leave Washington via helicopter, refers to Nixon departing the White House grounds in similar fashion after his resignation. (RD) - NIT: We never see who Pinky chose as his Vice President. Since Pinky has studied the Constitution, he'd be well aware of his responsibilities along those lines. (RD) ================================================================================ Episode: 19 \"Brain's Song\" -- + The episode itself is, in part, a parody of the award-winning 1970 TV movie \"Brian's Song,\" about the relationship between Chicago Bears player Brian Piccolo (played by James Caan) and Gale Sayers (played by Billy Dee Willaims), and the tragedy which affects the entire team when Piccolo develops cancer. The movie itself is a classic tearjerker, and hence lies the crux of the PatB plot. (EOC) + The treatment Pinky undergoes at the beginning of the episode is lifted from the 1971 film, \"A Clockwork Orange\". (JK) + The scenes Pinky saw were: (JK) . Evil Kenivel's jump, which takes off his failed jump attempt two decades ago. . Lisa Marie Presley (daughter of Elvis) writing a letter to her ex-husband, Michael Jackson. . P&B Biography, a spoof of A&E Biography, a show that talks about the lives of different people, with a new topic each week. . A parody of Disney's 1994 animated feature \"The Lion King\". Looks to be very similar to \"The Tiger Prince\" spoof from Animaniacs episode 74. + G. Gordon Liddy became famous as being one of the Watergate burglars and is now a radio talk show host. (ME) + Jiffy Lube is a quick oil change business. (ME) + Meadowlark Lemon is best known as a former member of the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team. (ME) + Demi Moore rewriting Great Expectations is a parody of how the movie \"The Scarlett Letter\" was drastically changed from the book. (ME) + The Jamaican bobsled team of the 1988 Olympics made news because they were from a warm-weather country with no tradition of winter sports whatsoever. A Disney movie, \"Cool Runnings\" was made about the team in 1993. (EOC, BN) + The 'playfield' that the mice use is an electronic football game that was immensely popular in the 1970s. You'd turn it on, and the 'players' would be vibrated across the 'field'. It was VERY noisy, and as demonstrated by Brain, it could easily give one the jitters. (MN) - Pinky as Coach Bear Bottom, is probably a parody of the late Bear Bryant, the Univ. of Alabama's great football coach. (EOC) + Toduh == Today (NBC's morning program), which as of this writing, is in its 41st year. The gentleman on the left is ex-cohost Bryant Gumbel, and the person on the right is host Katie Couric. (EOC) + \"Jellyroll\" Morton was an important musician in jazz history. (ME) ================================================================================ Episode: 20 \"Welcome to the Jungle\" -- + The thing at the end of Brain's student film refers to Mark VII Productions, the producers of Dragnet. (JK) + The \"Simian Liberation Army\" is based on those animal rights activist organizations that free laboratory animals so they won't be experimented on by scientists. (ME) + \"Simian Liberation Army\" is taken from \"Symbionese Liberation Army\", the terrorist group that kidnapped & brainwashed newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. It's also a swipe at the Animal Liberation Front, a quasi-terrorist group that \"liberates\" laboratory animals. (SFS) + When one of the members of the \"Simian Liberation Army\" calls Brain \"Bright Eyes\", it is a reference to the name that Jane Goodall gave to her favorite chimp during her study of chimpanzee life. (MaR) + Hakuna Matata is Swahili quote that became a catch phrase in 1994 thanks to the Disney animated feature, \"The Lion King\". (JK) + Davey Crockett was a famous American frontiersman, politician, who died heroicly defending the Alamo. Stories of his adventures have made him a legend. (ME) + The leech bit was from \"THE AFRICAN QUEEN.\" (1951) Humphrey Bogart has to get out of the boat and pull it, and when he gets back in, he is covered with leeches and he says that he hates them. (RN) + Ruth Bader Ginsberg is a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. (ME) + Club Med is a world wide chain of vacation resorts. (ME) + The Snowball plot line takes off \"Apocalypse Now\", a 1979 film in which Martin Sheen is sent to Vietnam to find and kill a crazed colonel played by Marlon Brando, who has set up a ruthless dictatorship. (JK, BN) + The fanatic follower of Snowball who speaks to Pinky and the Brain when they are tied to the stake is a parody of Dennis Hopper, who played a neurotic photographer in \"Apocalypse Now\", and is noted for his movie roles in which he plays, \"a manic-crazy psycho\", as Pinky notes. The same caricature seen here can be seen in the Animaniacs episode entitled \"Hearts of Twilight\". (BN) + $1.99, are you out of your mind? is a catch phrase for Denny's. (JK) + Greg Maddux is a multiple Cy Young award winning pitcher for Major League Baseball. He's been with the Atlanta Braves since 1993. (ME) ================================================================================ Episode: 21 \"A Little Off the Top\" -- + This short takes its text from the Bible, specifically the Book of Judges, Chapters 13 through 16, where the story of Samson, the original strong man, is told. (EOC) + It also, to a certain extent, is a spoof of the 1949 Cecil B. DeMille version of the story: . Delilah - is a spoof of Hedy Lamarr. Delilah's unintelligible German/English speech is a reference to the fact that Hedy had a noticeable German accent, though it wasn't anywhere near that bad. (JJW) . Samson - is something of a spoof of Victor Mature. (EOC) . George Sanders is also caricatured as the leader of the Philistines; he did win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in \"All About Eve\" and his second wife was Zsa Zsa Gabor, and he was briefly married to Magda Gabor shortly before his suicide in 1972. (EOC) . The lion fighting scene is a specific parody of a well-known scene from the DeMille version. (EOC) - Unfortunately, the characters aren't drawn to look anything like the original actors. A real missed opportunity on the part of the character designers. (JJW) \"Megalomaniacs Anonymous\" -- + I assume it was Al Haig who was in the television ad for Megalomaniacs Anonymous. Al Haig was the Secretary of State in 1981-82 under President Reagan and had to resign after a series of quarrels with senior members of the White House staff. (RN, BN) + The Al Haig gag with \"I'm in Charge\" refers to a specific statement he made at a press conference on the day Ronald Reagan was nearly assassinated by John Hinckley, in March of 1981. Haig, some think, meant to indicate that he was the person in charge on the spot (since a number of others, such as then VP Bush and then Speaker O'Neill were out of town), but this was generally viewed as Haig being, well, a megalomaniac. (EOC) + \"Ishtar\" was 1987 film that starred Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman, and is most famous for being a flop in the box office. (JK) + Pinky's Playhouse is most likely a reference to \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\", a popular cult children's show of the 1980's starring Paul Reubens as Pee-wee Herman. (JK) + Others in attendance at the meeting include Col. Qadaffi, Madonna, Ross Perot, Joseph Stalin, Julius Ceasar, Steven Spielberg, Bill Gates, and what may be SKG co-owners Jeff Katzenberg and David Geffen. (EOC, JJW) + The comment by Madonna that she no longer \"Vogue's\" but does the \"Family Circle\", is a nice gag on magazine titles, dancing, and her recent childbirth. (EOC) ================================================================================ Episode: 22 \"Brain of the Future\" -- + Esther Williams musicals, made during the 1940's and 1950's, featured her swimming ability. Thus, soaking up all the water would definitely make another Esther Williams musical impossible to make. (ME) + Fernando Lamas was Esther Williams third husband. (BN) + Cosmos-politan magazine == Cosmopolitan magazine, a magazine known to give small quizzes that determine how well one's marriage/sex life/ taste in clothes/etc. rates with their so-called experts, and which a number of readers take quite seriously. (BN, MN) - DYN - On the cover of Cosmos-politan, Hello Nurse in a Jetsonesque costume. (MN, PCat) + The conversation of the present and future mice is *very* similar to the one from the 1989 film \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\". (MN) + \"Knowing too much of one's future\" is a common motif in time travel stories, most recently used in the \"Back to the Future\" series of films. (MN) - NIT: The reporter announces that it's Clinton's 377th term in office. Assuming that terms were to remain 4 years in length, and that his terms were consecutive, that would give him 1508 years in office, beginning in 1992. That adds up to the year 3500, so January 12, 3502 AD would be his 378th term, not his 377th. (BN) + The Canadian Prime Minister's voice was an impression of the Rick Moranis character \"Bob MacKenzie.\" (RO) - USA attacking Canada may be a reference to the film \"Canadian Bacon\", a 1995 film about the US starting a war on Canada. (JK) - The Jimi Hendrix roach seems reminiscent of a character in Ralph Bakshi's \"Cool World\". (PCat) + The roach unveiling the Queen's statue is a parody of Ed Sullivan. Ed Sullivan was the host of a long-running variety show on the Columbia Broadcasting System from the late 40s to the early 70s. (It was called, at various times, \"The Toast of the Town\" and \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\") The show is probably best remembered for the historic appearances by Elvis Presley and the Beatles. Sullivan's stiff manner and unique speech pattern long made him the target of parodists. I am led to believe that Moe LaMarche has made a specialty of doing Sullivan (and the cockroach version is *very* well done, BTW). (EOC) + The Queen Roach is a parody of Zsa-Zsa Gabor. (many) + Pinky and the Brain's fruit disguises resemble the costumes of the characters appearing in commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear. (JK) - BTW, 10 marks out of 10 for history, since 37 AD was in fact the year Caligula became Emperor of Rome. (EOC) + Tia and Tamara are the stars of Sister, Sister, a WB show about twin sisters. (JK) ================================================================================ Episode: 23 \"Brinky\" -- + The exercise guru is Patrick Stewart, known for playing captain Jean-Luc Picard on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", the phrases he uses are 'catch phrases of Jean-Luc. (JK, BC) + Pauly Shore is an highly untalented actor who starred in such bombs as \"Encino Man\", \"Son-in-Law\" and \"Bio-Dome\". (JK) - DYN - The Superman logo on Brain's Band-Aid. (JK) + Brain's riff about \"I'll make two clones...\" is based on a famous mid-1980's commercial for Faberge Organics shampoo -- \"I'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends and so on and so on and so on.\" The screen would multiply much like it did on the computer monitor behind Brain. (BC) + When the cloning machine starts to overheat, Brain calls out for Pinky's help. When Pinky finally responds, Brain calls out \"Push! Push!\" Pinky responds by breathing heavily. This is, of course, a reference to the Lamaze method of natural childbirth. Forshadowing, perhaps, for his upcoming Mommyhood? (JWo) + \"You've got a male\" == \"You Got Mail\", a sound played on America Online when an e-mail message is received. (JK) + Pinky's original choice of name for the baby seems a bit off-color, as Mandingo is a slang term for a well-endowed African, Latino, or Italian male. + Michael Crichton is a highly successful author/screenwriter, probably best known currently for his novel-turned-blockbuster hit \"Jurassic Park\", about the cloning of dinosaurs using preserved DNA. (BN) + Odin is the chief of the gods in Norse mythology. He was usually pictured with a beard. Some types of cursing use characteristics of holy or well known people (ex. 'od's bodkins, By Neptune's pantry, etc.) (BL) + \"Be afraid. Be very afraid\" was the catchphrase of the promo campaign for the 1986 Jeff Goldblum remake of \"The Fly\". (RK) + \"Pat the Bunny\" is an actual book. It is designed as an interactive book for babies to play with. It features a soft bunny (for babies to pat), a small mirror, and more. (BN) + Dr. Benjamin Spock is a famous child psychologist. (ME) + Brain's growth chart is similar to those signs at the entrance of certain theme park attractions that point a minimum height requirement. (ME) + Taraxacum officinale is the Latin name for dandelion. (ME) + \"Jones\" is slang for craving or desire. (ME) + Pinky's line involving the blacklist during the Charlie McCarthy hearings is a rather involved cultural reference: (EOC) . Charlie McCarthy, of course, was a character created by Edgar Bergen, and was probably his most famous dummy. Charlie, who was famous for his \"feud\" with W.C. Fields on Bergen's Chase and Sanbourn radio programme in the late 30s, sported a monocle and usually (but not exclusively) wore evening dress. Hence the linkup with ventriloquism. . The other McCarthy being referred to is U.S. Senator Joe McCarthy (R-Wis.), first elected in 1946. McCarthy, of course, has given his name to an era of what some call hysterical anti-communism. Certainly, McCarthy was a champion publicity hound, and made numerous wild accusations, among other things, about the number of communists in the State Department. His performance in the so-called Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954 eventually led to his censure in 1954. . The blacklist is something slightly different. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC for short) made a number of investigations into the influence of the Communist Party in Hollywood, and held a number of high-profile hearings on the matter in 1947, and another round in 1951, at which a number of Hollywood stars testified. A number, however, refused to testify. The refusal of this group (which eventually got the nickname \"The Hollywood Ten\") got them blacklisted by the major studios, and the group (mostly screenwriters, like Dalton Trumbo, Alvah Bessie and Ring Lardner, Jr., but also well-known director Edward Dmytryk, who eventually testified and was removed from the blacklist) could not find work under their own names. The actual blacklist was maintained by a self-appointed vigilante group called Aware, and was circulated by the American Legion. While the blacklist died out in the late 50s, the aftershocks continue to this day; witness the views of some people regarding Elia Kazan, who testified and was viewed by some as a snitch. + \"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf\" is a play, later made into a movie, about two couples who constantly bicker in front of another couple. (ME) + \"I have no clone\" refers to the \"I have no son\" line \"The Jazz Singer\", a 1927 film about a guy who ignores his father's wishes and becomes a singer instead of a priest. (JK, E1) - Places on Brain's list of places: (ME) . NYU - New York University . library . museum . MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The Franklin Mint - maker of collectibles . The Pat Harrington Dinner Theater - Pat Harrington is best known as Dwayne Schneider on One Day At A Time. + Pete Rose holds baseball's record for career hits, but received a lifetime suspension from baseball in 1989 after allegations that he had bet on baseball games, including games played by his own team. (BN) + When Romie asks for a drink by saying, \"Hey, Don McLean, the levee is dry,\" he is referring to McLean's 1972 hit song \"American Pie\". A line from the chorus of that song is \"drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\". (RD) - Bar doesn't accept checks from: . Flea Bailey - F. Lee Bailey, best known lately for being one of O.J. Simpson's attorneys during the Simpson criminal trial. (ME) . Saul Below - author Saul Bellow, much of his work features alienated individuals in an indifferent society. In 1976, he won both the Pulitzer Prize in fiction and the Nobel Prize for literature. (Treesong, BN) . Jo-Jo The Thirsty Boy + Rikki Lake == Ricki Lake, one of many trashy talk shows on TV today. (JK) + Romy's \"My two dads...\" reference is another multi-level reference. \"My Two Dads\" was a sitcom in the late 1980's with the premise of a girl living with two men, both her \"dads\". Bob Saget and Dave Coulier were two stars of \"Full House\", a sitcom which involved three girls living with their father (Saget) and his two bachelor friends (Coulier and John Stamos). (BC, BN) + Guggenheim - The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, is considered to have one of the finest collections of modern art. Incidentally, the museum was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. (ME) + Euripides is the ancient Greek author perhaps best known for his play Medea and its deus ex machina ending. (ME) + \"When, in the course of human events\" are the first few words of America's Declaration of Independence. (ME) + \"Savannah\" is a drama on the WB network produced by Aaron Spelling. (JK) + The Grateful Dead stopped touring in 1995 when the lead singer, Jerry Garcia, died in a drug rehabilitation center. (ME) - Another interesting point, re: Romy's voice. What was clever about it was that when Romy was young and speaking more like Pinky, he was voiced by Maurice LaMarche (Brain), and when he was older and speaking more like Brain, he was voiced by Rob Paulsen (Pinky). It emphasizes further how Romy is indeed a combination of Pinky's and the Brain's DNA. (RO & many) - Here's one for the perfect timing file. The same weekend that this episode aired, cloning made national news when the first ever clone of a mammal, in this case a sheep, was completed successfully. (BN) ================================================================================ Episode: 24 \"Two Mice and a Baby\" -- + Title refers to \"3 Men and a Baby\", a 1987 film in which three bachelors take custody of a orphan baby girl. (JK) + The plot of the episode spoofs the 'origin of Superman' story. See the episode, \"The Last Son of Krypton\" on the WB animated series Superman for comparison. (EOC) + Salad Spinner == Salad Shooter, a kitchen utility that spits out what it slices. (ME) - DYN - One of the things Brain had for observing the stars was an Etch-a-Sketch. (JK) + G.I. Jack == G.I. Joe, a popular line of action figures. (JK) + The Singing Nun was a record from the early 1960's. (EOC) + The large, orange dinosaur on TV is Baloney, first seen in the Animaniacs short \"Baloney and Kids\", and is a parody of Barney, a large, purple dinosaur of a PBS educational series. (BN) + \"The Flying Nun\" was a late 1960's sitcom starring Sally Field as a young nun in a convent in Puerto Rico who could fly. (ME) \"The Maze\" -- + Brain's \"a superior intellect is an appalling object to squander\" is a clever rephrasing of NAACP slogan - \"A mind is a terrible thing to waste.\" (BN) + Branson, Missouri (USA) is famous for its concentration of country music attractions. (ME) + The Banana Splits was a Saturday morning show in the late 1960's about a band of animals. It was created by Hanna-Barbera with the costumes of the Banana Splits done by puppeteers, Sid and Marty Krofft. (JK) + Pinky's line \"I *am* the King\" was also used by Rob Paulsen as Yakko in Animaniacs episode #10 \"King Yakko\" -- here's the reference according to the CRGA: * \"I *am* the King\" parodies a series of commercials from the * mid-1980s. The ads were shown in the LA area and featured Paul \"the King * of Big-Screen\", a television salesman. The ads show him wearing a crown, * and the commercials always end with him saying, \"I *am* the King.\" It is a * joke that I imagine only LA residents would pick up on. (BH, RayD, BW) + Dilithium is what powers the starships in Star Trek (except the ship in Star Trek : Voyager). (ME) + Vinny Barbarino was John Travolta's character in the TV show, \"Welcome Back, Kotter\". (JK) + The scene with the various twisted staircases resembles M.C. Escher's famous work, \"House of Stairs\". (CN) - DYN - \"Steppenwolf\" (band famous for \"Born to be Wild\") in the 8-track of Brain's contraption. (BN) ================================================================================ Episode: 25 \"Leave it to Beavers\" -- + The title is a reference to the 1950-60's program \"Leave it to Beaver\" starring Jerry Mathis. The similarity ends at the title though, as nothing else in the episode refers to \"Leave it to Beaver\". (BN) - NIT: Electrons are fired from a cathode-ray tube, not photons. Brain ought to have known this. (CSa) + Brain's comment: \"I shall return,\" is the famous quote spoken by U.S. General Douglas MacArthur. (BN) \"Cinebrainia\" -- + The title is a reference to \"Cinemania\", a computer CD-ROM reference of films, actors\\actresses and the movie industry which is published yearly by Microsoft Corporation. (BN) - There's a bit of a historical gap between Edison's invention (and in turn, what appears to be meant as a clip from \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1979)) to 1920s-style comedy. (It's certainly post-1918, since Pinky refers to a comeback by Kaiser Wilhem, who abidcated his position as emperor of Germany in November, 1918 -- though Wilhelm spent the rest of his life in Holland, and unlike his fellow Kaiser Karl Hapsburg, did not attempt a comeback.) (EOC) + The era of nickelodeons was around the time shortly after the invention of the camera. Most all nickelodeon films were short (less than one reel), and were dedicated to side-show acts, nature scenes, or other non-story films. One of the things they did was film a train going toward the camera slowly and sped it up. These kind of shorts were the ones that drove people out the theaters, and were probably what was being referenced to. In addition, if the clip was from the Great Train Robbery (which I doubt), it surely wouldn't have been the film released in 1979. There was the original version (a silent film) released in the very early 1900's (i.e. circa 1915-1925). (JWh) + \"The Great Train Robbery\" is known for the legend that people ran out of the theater when the train appeared on the screen. (JK) + Brain's mountee bit spoofs the Perils of Pauline, a silent film series that led to the invention of cliffhangers in films. (JK) + \"Hal Slug\" == Hal Roach, independent producer of short & feature-length comedies. His most famous stars were Laurel and Hardy (parodied here by Pinky and the Brain), who worked for him from the twenties through the early forties. He also produced the long running \"Little Rascals\" series until he sold it to MGM in 1938. (JJW, ME) + Bathing beauties were a trademark of Mack Sennett, the silent-era archrival to Hal Roach. (EOC) + The kid coming in as the mice are leaving is Carl Switzer who played Alfalfa, one of the more famous members of the \"Our Gang\"/\"Little Rascals\" series. According to a \"Little Rascals\" FAQ, he was killed after pulling a knife on a man who owed him money and the man then shot him in self-defense. (ME) - NIT: Alfalfa wasn't originally in the group. He did not appear until 1935. (JK) + Clarence Birdseye figured out how to freeze food so that it could be sold in grocery stores. (ME) - \"Clarence Birdseye\" was changed from \"Jerry Lewis\" in ADR. (RC) - DYN: The title card for \"Get Squished\" lists Russell Calabrese as the director. Russell Calabrese directed the both segments of today's episode. (ME) + A reference to the infamous Jerry Lewis film \"The Day the Clown Cried\" can be seen on one movie poster. It was a film about a clown that entertains kids in a Nazi concentration camp which was never released. (EOC, JK) - This is the second time that film has been referenced in a WBA cartoon; the first, of course, was \"The Wretched Clown\" in Animaniacs' \"Hearts of Twilight\" -- episode 20. (JJW) + Norma Talmadge started what we now know as the \"Hollywood Walk of Fame\" when she accidently stepped into wet cement in front of Graumann's Chinese Theater in 1927. (ME) - \"The Emperor Brain\" is probably a reference to \"The Emperor Jones\" (see the Paul Robeson version, 1933). (EOC) + In \"The Emperor Brain\" movie, when Brain is being experimented on with two disembodied rings of light moving up and down, the reference is to Fritz Lang's classic 1926 silent movie \"Metropolis,\" where in one scene a mad scientist creates a lifelike robot using rings of light that look and move in the same way. (JJW) - The scene with Brain in the desert is probably a reference to Rudolph Valentino's performance in the 1921 silent film \"The Sheik\". (JK, BN) + The remaing person in the audience appears to be Walt Disney who gets the idea for Mickey Mouse's ears from Brain's shadow. Notice the music vaguely resembles \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" from Disney's \"Pinocchio\" (1940). (ME) + \"I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille\" refers to Norma Desmond's famous quote from \"Sunset Boulevard\", a 1950 movie about a silent screen actress attempting a comeback. (ME) + Hollywoodland was a real estate development of the 1920s that either Roach or Sennett (I think the former) was involved in. The venture failed, but was the source of the famous \"Hollywood\" sign, which was shortened from \"Hollywoodland\" in 1949. (EOC, ME) ================================================================================ Episode: 26 \"Hoop Schemes\" -- + The title refers to the 1994 documentary \"Hoop Dreams\", filmed by Frederick Marx, Peter Gilbert and Steve James. It follows two inner-city Chicago high school basketball players, Arthur Agee and William Gates, through high school and into college, as they pursue their dream of playing in the NBA. The film won several critics awards, but did not receive any Oscar nominations, which many felt it deserved. (BN) + Nathan Lane is an actor who is known for Broadway musicals such as \"Guys and Dolls\", and \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\", which he won a Tony for. He is also known for such films as \"The Lion King\", where he voiced Timon the meerkat, and \"The Birdcage\". (JK) - The line about him being greedy and needy is one whose specific reference I can't pinpoint, but I recall that Lane refused to repeat his stage role in \"Love! Valour! Compassion!\" in the film version; maybe he wanted more money? (JJW) - The opening song, with its \"la-la-lo,\" may be reminiscent of a Simon & Garfunkel song, \"The Boxer,\" where the refrain was \"Lie-a-lie.\" (JJW) + Peter Bogdanovich is a film director [\"The Last Picture Show\" (1971) and \"Paper Moon\" (1973)] with a rather well-publicized sex life (his partners including Cybill Shepherd and the late Dorothy Stratten). (JJW) + The Jordan-Baseball joke refers to 1993, when Michael Jordan \"retired\" from the NBA and joined the Birmingham Barons, a minor league AA team part of the Chicago White Sox organization. However, his baseball skills were not as good as his basketball skills. Jordan decided to leave baseball and returned to basketball in mid-1995. (JK, ME) + \"Got My Mojo Working\" is a much covered blues song either by Anne Cole or Muddy Waters, depending on who you talk to. \"Mojo\" is a magic vodoo charm. (ME) - According to the billboard, Indiana is the \"Home of Man\". (BN) + The person Pinky suggests they're going to see in Indiana is Scott Joplin. To my knowledge, Joplin never set foot in that state. Joplin (1868?-1917) was the \"King of Ragtime Writers,\" composing several tunes you've undoubtedly heard before. Notable titles: Maple Leaf Rag, The Entertainer, Gladiolus Rag. (RO) + Bobby Nacht == Bobby Knight, coach of the Indiana Hoosiers. Known as a demanding disciplinarian with an explosive temper (Yes, he did in fact throw chairs!). He led the Hoosiers to NCAA titles in 1976, 1981 and 1987. He also coached the gold medal winning men's basketball team of the 1984 Olympics. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1991. (BN) - And, of course, \"Nacht\" is German for \"night.\" (RO) + Tom Lehrer is famous for his comedy songs of the 1950s and '60s. Notable titles: The Masochism Tango, Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, So Long Mom -- A Ballad for World War III, The Vatican Rag. He also wrote a couple songs for the PBS children's program \"The Electric Company\". Currently, Lehrer is a math professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. (RO) - Lehrer also wrote \"The Elements\", which obviously inspired the Animaniacs songs \"Yakko's World\", \"Wakko's America\", and \"The Presidents Song\". Lehrer's \"New Math\" was adapted by the A! staff for \"Multiplication\". (JWo) + \"Space Jam\" was a 1996 film starring Michael Jordan. The plot centered around Jordan joining the Looney Tunes in a basketball game against aliens who stole the basketball talent from five NBA stars. (JK) + Brain's basketball teammates include: . Jamie Furr == Jamie \"Klinger on M*A*S*H\" Farr. (JJW) . Flop Wilson == Flip Wilson, comedian and host of an early 1970's variety television show of the same name, on which Flip would dress up in drag and play a character named Geraldine Jones. (BN) . Chuck Foolery == Game show host (\"The Love Connection\") Chuck Woolery. (JJW) . "
