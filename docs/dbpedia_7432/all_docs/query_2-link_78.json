        "text": "Quoting Conventions for Web Developers\n\nThe Short Answer\n\nIn HTML the use of single quotes (') and double quotes (\") are interchangeable, there is no difference.\n\nBut consistency is recommended, therefore we must pick a syntax convention and use it regularly.\n\nThe Long Answer\n\nWeb Development often consists of many programming languages. HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, ASP, RoR, Python, etc. Because of this we have many syntax conventions for different programming languages. Often habits from one language will follow us to other languages, even if it is not considered \"proper\" i.e. commenting conventions. Quoting conventions also falls into this category for me.\n\nBut I tend to use HTML tightly in conjunction with PHP. And in PHP there is a major difference between single quotes and double quotes. In PHP with double quotes \"you can insert variables directly within the text of the string\". (scriptingok.com) And when using single quotes \"the text appears as it is\". (scriptingok.com)\n\nPHP takes longer to process double quoted strings. Since the PHP parser has to read the whole string in advance to detect any variable inside—and concatenate it—it takes longer to process than a single quoted string. (scriptingok.com)\n\nSingle quotes are easier on the server. Since PHP does not need to read the whole string in advance, the server can work faster and happier. (scriptingok.com)\n\nOther things to consider\n\nFrequency of double quotes within string. I find that I need to use double quotes (\") within my strings more often than I need to use single quotes (') within strings. To reduce the number of character escapes needed I favor single quote delimiters.\n\nIt's easier to make a single quote. This is fairly self explanatory but to clarify, why press the SHIFT key more times than you have to.\n\nMy Convention\n\nWith this understanding of PHP I have set the convention (for myself and the rest of my company) that strings are to be represented as single quotes by default for server optimization. Double quotes are used within the string if a quotes are required such as JavaScript within an attribute, for example:\n\n<button onClick='func(\"param\");'>Press Me</button>\n\nOf course if we are in PHP and want the parser to handle PHP variables within the string we should intentionally use double quotes. $a='Awesome'; $b = \"Not $a\";\n\nSources\n\nSingle quotes vs Double quotes in PHP. (n.d.). Retrieved November 26, 2014, from http://www.scriptingok.com/tutorial/Single-quotes-vs-double-quotes-in-PHP\n\nIt makes no difference to the html but if you are generating html dynamically with another programming language then one way may be easier than another.\n\nFor example in Java the double quote is used to indicate the start and end of a String, so if you want to include a doublequote within the String you have to escape it with a backslash.\n\nString s = \"<a href=\\\"link\\\">a Link</a>\"\n\nYou don't have such a problem with the single quote, therefore use of the single quote makes for more readable code in Java.\n\nString s = \"<a href='link'>a Link</a>\"\n\nEspecially if you have to write html elements with many attributes.(Note I usually use a library such as jhtml to write html in Java, but not always practical to do so)\n\nLots of great insightful replies here! More than enough for anyone to make a clear and personal decision.\n\nI would simply like to point out one thing that's always mattered to me.\n\nAnd take this with a grain of salt!\n\nDouble quotes apply to strings that have more than a single phase such as \"one two\" rather than single quotes for 'one' or 'two'. This can be traced as far back as C and C++.\n\n(reference here or do your own online search).\n\nAnd that's truly the difference.\n\nWith this principle (this different), parsing became possible such as \"{{'a','b'},{'x','y'}} or \"/[^\\r\\n]*[\\r\\n]\" (which needed to be space independent because it's expressional) or more famously for HTML specific title = \"Hello HTML!\" or style = \"font-family:arial; color:#FF0000;\"\n\nThe funny thing here is that HTML (coming from XML itself) commonly adopted double quotes due to expressional features even if it is a single character (e.g. number) or single phase string.\n\nAs NibblyPig pointed out quite well and straightforward:\n\n\" as a top-tier and ' as a second tier since \"'a string here'\" is valid and expected by W3 standards (which is for the web) and will most likely never change.\n\nAnd for consistency, double quotes is wisely used, but only fully correct by preference.\n\nIn PHP using double quotes causes a slight decrease in performance because variable names are evaluated, so in practice, I always use single quotes when writing code:\n\necho \"This will print you the value of $this_variable!\"; echo 'This will literally say $this_variable with no evaluation.';\n\nSo you can write this instead;\n\necho 'This will show ' . $this_variable . '!';\n\nI believe Javascript functions similarly, so a very tiny improvement in performance, if that matters to you.\n\nAdditionally, if you look all the way down to HTML spec 2.0, all the tags listed here;\n\nW3 HTML DTD Reference\n\n(Use doublequotes.) Consistency is important no matter which you tend to use more often.\n\nDouble quotes are used for strings (i.e., \"this is a string\") and single quotes are used for a character (i.e., 'a', 'b' or 'c'). Depending on the programming language and context, you can get away with using double quotes for a character but not single quotes for a string.\n\nHTML doesn't care about which one you use. However, if you're writing HTML inside a PHP script, you should stick with double quotes as you will need to escape them (i.e., \\\"whatever\\\") to avoid confusing yourself and PHP."
