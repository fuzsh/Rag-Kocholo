        "text": "I’ve already ranked the characters in a few tier lists, but after the release of season 2 I’ve changed my mind about a few characters in terms of ranking order, plus I just wanted to gush about my favs!\n\n(Just a heads up…this is gonna be a long one.)\n\n10-Julia\n\nJulia 100% would be higher if she were in more than 2 episodes as of the time of writing, but she isn’t so she lacks the depth others on the list have.\n\nShe was already sweet in her debut, but what ultimately got her here is how she stole the show in “Reichenbrain Falls”. She went from being kind, considerate, hardworking yet somewhat reserved to being an over-enthusiastic, crazy genius out for revenge.\n\nHonestly, I believe that she wants to take over the world not necessarily because she’s interested in ruling the world, but more because of sunk-cost fallacy (she was really close to succeeding before Brain tried to mind-control her, plus her exact words were “…because I deserve to rule the world!”) and because it would be the perfect way to get revenge on Brain.\n\nWhat helps her stay likeable is that her wanting revenge is justified, what Brain did to her was wrong.\n\nShe’s also really funny to watch-she’s kind of like Brain and Pinky combined (Brain’s intelligence with Pinky’s insanity), and serves as a lasting consequence of Brain’s actions. Whatever him and Pinky get up to is usually swept under the rug by the end of an episode as they return to the lab for tomorrow night, but not this time.\n\nI’m glad they’re not implying she still has feelings for Brain or that he might have feelings for her (so far, at least…please keep it up). Enemies to Lovers (or is it Lovers to Enemies to Lovers in this case?) has been done really badly in…certain franchises recently so I’m glad they’re not doing that here.\n\nPlus, Julia’s leitmotif is an inverted version of the Pinky and the Brain theme song-that’s just cool!\n\n9-Dr Scratchansniff\n\nUp next is Scratchy!\n\nWhat I like about Dr Scratchansniff is that due to his heavy accent, he could’ve easily been made a weirdo and have his whole character be “haha foreigners and their funny sounding accents, aren’t they weird?” it was the 90’s, they probably could’ve gotten away with it. Instead (thankfully) in most episodes the opposite is true. He’s usually the straight man to other character’s antics, be it the Warners, Mr Plotz, etc.\n\nHe also has a really nice “arc” (I use that term loosely) about warming up to the Warners. He goes from wanting to avoid them as much as possible (he even threatened to turn them into stew in The Monkey Song), to actually getting along with them pretty well, to essentially becoming their dad. I think it’s sweet! Most people point to “I’m Mad” being the moment that established his “dad status” by taking the Warners to a Circus, but what sold it for me was actually the segment “Fake”, where the Warners agree to come with Scratchy to a wrestling match, even though they know it’s fake and didn’t want to be there. He didn’t force them, they agreed to go seemingly just to make him happy. I can’t imagine the Warners purposefully choosing not to have fun for anyone other than someone they considered family.\n\nAlthough season 4 and 5 of the original show kind of ruin it (their dynamic in “Anchors Awarners” is extremely simplified and then in season 5 the Warners barely interact with Scratchy)…but let’s not talk about that, look at Scratchy tuck the Warners into bed!\n\nAdorable!\n\n8-Rita\n\nShe’s not talked about all that much, but Rita actually has some depth to her character. Not to mention her segments had a lot of heart.\n\nIn “When Rita met Runt” we find out she was made cynical and world-weary due to neglect. She tries to tell herself she hates humans and just wants their food, but deep down she really just wants a good home with a loving owner. She tries to be independent and not get attached to Runt at first, but she does anyway and by “Puttin’ on the Blitz” she proves to be fiercely loyal (and tough too) by giving up her chance for that loving home to save Runt.\n\nAt end of the day she really just craves love and affection, it’s the main reason she considers raising the kittens in “Smitten with Kittens”, even though she knows she can barely feed herself and Runt, let alone three more people.\n\nHer segments in the original probably had the most amount of heartfelt moments between them out of any other character’s segments, which helps her character stand out amongst the more comedic members of the cast. The only downside of this is that due to her character being taken more seriously than most on the show, she’s not all that funny. Not unfunny, but after her first episode (with snarky lines like “Get a kid lady”) I can’t recall that many times she made me laugh. Which is fine, but it IS a comedy show after all.\n\nAnd she obviously has a phenomenal singing voice thanks to Bernadette Peters!\n\n7-Nora\n\nNora was funny enough in season 1, but she didn’t get much screen time. Her personality was established well enough-she was condescending, stern, and selfish, but she wasn’t all that fleshed out, beyond being a sort of foil to the Warners. She’s no-nonsense whereas they always mess about. What really got her on this list was how she was fleshed out in season 2.\n\nAt first I did prefer Plotz, but season 2 has developed Nora to the point where I think she has more depth as a character than Plotz does. He’s a fun character but was kinda just bossy, mean and greedy, that’s about it-his season 2 cameo was fun though.\n\nWe learn that Nora overcompensates for her lack of parenting skills by buying her daughter whatever she wants.\n\nShe has also shown more signs of being short-tempered, having more fits of rage than last season.\n\nWe also find out why she’s so competitive and obsessed with success, because of her family, mainly her great grandmother Flora Dora. Her sisters belittle her, her great grandmother not only is a very successful business woman but also constantly organizes competitions at family gatherings, it’s no wonder she’s a firm believer in “pulling up the ladder behind her”.\n\nShe seems to want to live up to her great grandmother’s legacy, she does seem to genuinely look up to her. Plotz was motivated mostly by making money, whereas Nora only seems interested in money as proof of her status and how successful she is, not necessarily due to greed, otherwise she wouldn’t spend millions on her daughter. This may even explain why she is very concerned about being in shape (almost every time they cut to her in her office she’s exercising).\n\nShe doesn’t just want to be successful (or at least, her idea of being successful) she needs people to know it just by looking at her.\n\nOverall, I like the direction they took with her character and I can’t wait to see more from her.\n\n6-Wakko\n\nSurprised? I do like Wakko, but not as much as most of the fandom it seems.\n\nHe does stand out amongst the Warners though, being less reliant on witty dialogue and more on visual gags and slapstick.\n\nOne aspect of his character that I like that I don’t see many people talk about is that he’s a bit of a tinkerer. Moments that come to mind are when he “fixed” the garage remote in “Garage Sale of the Century”, when he built a huge contraption just to use a whoopie cushion, and even one moment in the reboot where he microwaved a TV remote because he thought it would give it magical powers in “Animani-yet”. I wonder if season 2 of the reboot establishing that he likes video games is meant to be acknowledgment of his interest in tech.\n\nI like that all the Warners are supposed to be maniacs yet he’s known as the “crazy one”, which a lot of his gimmicks make pretty clear (his gag bag, saying made up words like “faboo”, a weird obsession with Don Knotts, acts more animalistic than the other two Warners-often acting like a dog and is often seen letting his tongue hang out, etc).\n\nI do like Wakko but to me he’s more likeable than he is…funny? I dunno, he’s not unfunny but he doesn’t make me laugh as much as the next five do. Not to mention isn’t that complex either, which is fine, I mean all Animaniacs characters aren’t that complex to be honest, but Wakko more so than others.\n\nNot to say that he’s one-note, because he’s not. In addition to being the insane “eating stuff guy”, he’s also naïve, optimistic, sincere (if not just straight up blunt at times), and kind-hearted, even though he can be emotionally volatile. There’s no doubt in my mind the show wouldn’t be the same without him.\n\n5-Slappy\n\nShe may be ranked 5th highest, but if we’re talking purely on a comedic standpoint Slappy’s probably one of the funniest characters in the franchise. Part of the reason why is because…well…she’s awful.\n\nShe’s lazy. She’s cranky. She’s vindictive. She’s bitter. She’s violent and borderline sadistic. She’s also aware of all that and doesn’t wish to change.\n\nShe’s where a lot of the show’s cynical edge to its humour comes from. What helps is that for all her flaws, it’s not like she actively tries to cause trouble. She just wants to be left alone most of the time. But, like what often happens to the Warners, someone just has to swoop in and act like a jerk. And when someone tries to mess with Slappy, she holds nothing back. It’s almost admirable…almost.\n\nRemember when she bombed a critic’s house because he didn’t find her funny (and expressed disappointment when she found out he WASN’T inside his house when she did)? Or when she threatened to blow up a jury (of biased wolves, to be fair) unless they voted her not-guilty on a crime she technically did commit…and then blew them up anyway?\n\nAgain, she’s no role model. She does what she does because she thinks it’s funny-and it is!\n\nAlthough I do like the scene in “The Sound of Warners” that shows that whilst the Warners only use force against people who deliberately wronged them, Slappy will just bomb anyone who she finds annoying, whether they meant it or not. Stuff like that makes her bond with Skippy all the more adorable, because you know how mean she can be to almost everyone else. Yet she genuinely does a pretty good job raising Skippy. They get along pretty much all the time, she does her best to keep him happy (in “Bumbie’s Mom” she flew across the country in a plane just so he’d stop crying over a movie, for example), she even tries to teach him lessons sometimes-although sometimes regrets it because it makes her “sound like an after school special”.\n\nShe’s a veteran toon who knows every trick in the book, often deconstructing gags and can beat her foes without breaking a sweat-now that’s comedy!\n\n4-Brain\n\nSlappy has the edge when it come to comedy, but Brain is a bit more complex in terms of character and still makes me laugh. Slappy is funny but ultimately is a simple character.\n\nWhilst Brain is very monotone in the early episodes, overtime he develops to become a lot more expressive, megalomaniacal, grouchy and sympathetic.\n\nI admire his perseverance-the guy never gives up. He doesn’t let the fact that he is a tiny lab mouse stop him from trying to take over the world, despite the fact that he has failed over and over again. Now, is this a good goal to have? No. Are his methods always morally sound? No. But you just can’t help but root for him. Even though a lot of his plans are ridiculous, and even though Pinky tends to get blamed for them going wrong (and admittedly a lot of the time it is his fault) Brains screws up his own plans just as much. But I kinda like that? Brain’s smart but he’s not necessarily wise, if you get what I mean.\n\nBrain’s been given multiple backstories, but each one reveals he basically only wants to take over the world because he feels unsafe and fears not being in control for fear of it leading to him getting hurt. They also seem to have affected how willing he is to be open about his feelings or his affection for others (mainly Pinky). He tries to gain control of the world as a way of seeking comfort over what happened to him, be it him being taken from his home or being experimented on the the point where it physically damaged his tail. He also seems to genuinely believe he’d make the world a better place.\n\nThen there’s his bond with Pinky, which is…“complicated”? He does insult and bop him, but we know at this point he does consider him his best friend, he just struggles with being open about it. There have been multiple times when it seemed like he might lose Pinky forever, and each time he gets upset about it, sometimes to the point of crying. Not to mention he always makes sure his plans involve Pinky in some way, when he could probably come up with a plan that he could do completely by himself if he really wanted to.\n\nThe segment Future Brain even shows that he literally trusts Pinky more than he trusts himself. That’s actually really sweet.\n\n3-Pinky\n\nI genuinely think Pinky is probably the nicest character on the show (although let’s be honest, the bar isn’t…all that high) considering he never really wants to fight or hurt anyone. He just wants to get along with everybody. In fact it’s the main reason reason I ranked him higher than Brain. Not to blame Brain for being world-weary; given his trauma I get why he resorts to doing some of the things he does, but I just think Pinky’s acts of kindness are touching. The usually emotionally constipated Brain even said once that Pinky is “pure of heart”…before insulting his intelligence(or I guess lack thereof), but still.\n\nHis endless loyalty and love for Brain is so endearing. His tendency to put Brain’s wants above his own, like when he dedicated what was supposed to be his Christmas list to asking for something Brain wants, because he knows how much it means to Brain, or when he pushed aside his own birthday (the ONE day of the year he gets to call the shots) just so Brain could focus on taking over the world, is somewhat admirable but also kind of sad. In a good way.\n\nNot that he lacks agency or his own wants/priorities. He’s shown interest in make up, fashion, cooking, cheese (of course), whatever the latest most popular genre of music is (be it country or pop), etc. I think him spending so much time watching TV is what led to him being very interested in pop culture, and that in turn has led to him being more of a people person than Brain (which I guess isn’t too hard to achieve). Pinky tends to get along with strangers quite well and very quickly most of the time, which has come in handy for a lot of Brain’s plans.\n\nAlso, thanks to the “Are you pondering what I’m pondering?” gag, he gets really bizarre dialogue a lot of the time, so bizarre you can’t help but laugh. Not to mention the times he just resorts to saying made up words.\n\nAnother reason Pinky is so high is because right out the gate he proved to be an entertaining character. Brain took a while to become an engaging character, but Pinky always had fun quirks, even before his later developments. We find out pretty soon he’s a TV addict, has a funny British accent, is cheerful, spontaneously yells made up words , and is really, REALLY stupid. Slappy excels at comedy, but Brain has more depth as a character, and Pinky is a good middle ground between those two things.\n\n2-Dot\n\nCan I talk about her design first? She is the cute one after all. I appreciate that, unlike a lot of female character designs for animals (particularly older designs, from the 1920’s all the way to the 90’s), she’s not just the main male lead turned pink or with a bow on-for example, she has no whiskers, unlike Yakko or Wakko (those aren’t whiskers, that’s her hair). She also isn’t unnecessarily given human anatomy or human-looking hair. She isn’t permanently given eyelashes to make it obvious that she’s a girl-she’s only drawn with eyelashes when she’s purposely trying to look cute for the camera, as seen below. Otherwise she’ll just have dot eyes, just like her brothers. This post will give you a better idea of what I mean.\n\nIn fact she probably has the best design of the Warners. Not only is she, well…CUTE, her pink skirt and flower help her look feminine and stylish, but without over-doing it with the cuteness by giving her a more covered up/conservative (conservative as in traditional, not in a political context) look . Her brothers’ designs don’t really say anything about their personalities (if you didn’t know who Yakko and Wakko were, what about their designs would indicate that Yakko likes to talk? Or that Wakko likes to eat?) Her outfit is also the best homage to classic characters from the 1920’s/30’s.\n\nYakko would be more accurate if he was wearing shorts, and Wakko’s backwards cap screams the 90’s.\n\nFun fact! Dot’s original concept art design kinda resembles Minnie’s modern look (although given when it was drawn, this was of course unintentional)\n\nNow on to her personality, Dot has a lot of good dialogue, although some lines make me laugh specifically because of Tress Macneille’s delivery. Dot often uses cuteness to get out of danger or to give foes a false sense of security, so it’s all the more surprising when she roars at them or bludgeons them with a mace. It’s sneaky and it’s cool to see how she takes what many might see as a weakness (being small and dainty) and make it her strength.\n\nAnd given that she was created in the 90’s, I appreciate that she’s actually allowed to be witty and funny and wacky and isn’t just eye candy or the damsel in distress, or the love interest (although since she’s the little sister this was a given), or the no nonsense one. She has a very fleshed out personality. She’s acerbic, short-tempered, extremely confident in herself, competitive, violent, and LOVES getting attention. Obviously she’s not the first good animated female character, but legitimately well written animated female leads who didn’t have sexist tropes tied to their characters were rarer back in the day.\n\nWhilst I do applaud the original series for how it handled Dot’s cuteness, I do like how the reboot has shown how she can stand out amongst the Warners beyond being the “cute one”. Let’s be honest, in the original series her other defining traits were taken to the extreme by one of her brothers; her brothers got to be the best at multiple things whilst she only got one main thing (Honestly I also personally think the original series kinda underutilised her in general compared to her brothers). Yeah she was smart but Yakko was the smartest. Yeah she could be violent but Wakko was more destructive. So what was left for Dot to be the best at? Being cute…and that’s about it. So it’s great to see that in the reboot many episodes have emphasized that she does excel in at least one other area beyond being cute-determination. Segments like Rug of War, Warner’s Ark, The Warner’s Vault, Suffragette City, etc really show off her spunk and how passionate she can be, even more so than her brothers.\n\n1-Yakko\n\nNo change here, Yakko’s still my favourite! He has a lot of traits I find entertaining; he’s a wise-guy, a know it all, a good big brother, crafty, and actually pretty laid back when not purposefully playing up the zaniness. His snarky remarks are always great, they always seem to save the best dialogue for him. I like that the reboot emphasized just how much he likes to sing. He always did, all the Warners do, but Yakko in particular seems almost obsessed with it. It makes sense, he is the one who yaks, plus it makes for a funny running gag.\n\nHe also tends to try and turn things into a comedy bit. He’s shocked about a new revelation? He grabs a drink just so he can do a spit take. They lack a map? He pretends to have one and claims it’s improv. He’s definitely dedicated to being “the funny guy”.\n\nOne thing I find funny about him is that he can get weirdly petty about things (specifically needing lukewarm tea, insisting his slacks are smoky topaz not tan, considering wearing a coat as some sort of sacrifice, etc)\n\nit’s also nice to see a male lead in a cartoon comedy that isn’t either optimistic, upbeat and wacky-but dumb, or they are smart but are either cynical, grouchy and/or mean, or they’re the “loser” nerd who gets made fun of every other episode. Heck, those descriptions fit some characters within Animaniacs itself! But not with Yakko, turns out male leads can be energetic AND smart without being made fun of for it! Who would’ve thought? Obviously, again, NOT the first time this has happened in a cartoon (Sokka, for example), but I find that a lot of male main characters (I’m talking specifically about animated comedies here, not fiction in general) fall under one of those three categories.\n\nAnd unlike his siblings, who will often resort to violence/slapstick to best an opponent, Yakko (usually) just solves his problems verbally, which I find a little more engaging to watch. “Morning Malaise”, “Rome Sweet Rome” and the song “Be Like Me” are some good examples of this.\n\n“Fear and Laughter in Burbank” I would argue improves his character, confirming that he hates being alone, fears not being funny/losing his voice and seems to seek validation, via either his jokes or his singing. Hence why he references Yakko’s World a lot, it’s a crowd pleaser. It’s his go-to to get someone to like him, like in “Sweet and Sour Sixteen” when he tries to calm the crowd, and in “Yakko Amakko” when he tries to win the animator over by singing it. It’s endearing to see a more anxious side to a character who otherwise doesn’t take things too seriously.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAlright, that’s all I got! This might be my longest post ever but it was really fun to write. Who are your favourite Animaniacs characters?\n\nI’m going to list a few things I think the reboot does better than the original show so far (not including technical things like animation quality or sound quality, that’s not a fair comparison). Here we go:\n\n1. There’s a “Here’s the show’s namey” variant every episode now rather than re-used lines (like “Pinky and the Brain-y”). I totally get why the original show re-used lines (although by season 3 they do so way less), but it’s just really cool the a new and unique one every episode now.\n\n2. Yakko’s role as big brother seems more apparent now. He was always the leader in the original show sure, and he clearly did care for his siblings, but there wasn’t really a sense of authority there. The Warners, either alone or together, always did their own thing. The fact that they weren’t all (physically) the same age didn’t really matter in most episodes, and often only apparent due to their (kind of inconsistent in the original-I SAID I WOULDN’T TALK ABOUT THE ANIMATION) height differences. Now, in addition to him being the leader, there’s multiple episodes where Dot/Wakko will ask Yakko for permission to do stuff, like keeping the bunnies as pets or to watch TV.\n\nIt’s a cute touch, a nice little reminder that “Oh yeah they’re not triplets”.\n\n3. The PG rating has allowed for edgier jokes/language. Characters can say “Hell” now, Pinky almost said “bull-(you know what)” and Wakko almost said “motherf-(you know what)”, then there’s these:\n\nIt’s dark but I think it’s funny darn it 🤣.\n\n4. Less mediocre segments. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again, the Warners, Pinky and the Brain and Slappy carried the original show. I also enjoyed Rita and Runt and Minerva Mink segments, but they were cut from the show after season 1, so that sucks. Every other segment on the show I consider kinda okay/mediocre/bad 🤷‍♀️. A lot of characters would’ve worked better as recurring characters within segments where they’re not the stars. Honestly their absence is a positive in my book, while watching the original show I often found myself thinking “Man I wish this show only had the Warners, Pinky and the Brain and Slappy segments in it”. I know Slappy isn’t in the reboot but that’s not a deal breaker for me (the other two segments are a lot more popular so I understand prioritising them). If no Slappy also means no Katie Kaboom, I’m good.\n\n5. More heartfelt moments - outside of the Rita and Runt segments (as in there’s a higher ratio of them, not trying to compare how heartfelt they are). In the original, pretty much the only segments that had heartfelt moments consistently was Rita and Runt (Rita’s song about humans, “Smitten with Kitttens”, “Puttin’ on the Blitz”, etc). This is fine, it’s a comedy show; but it would have been nice if some of the characters that got a lot more screen time than those two (the Warners, Pinky and the Brain, etc) had some too, especially since there are no Rita and Runt segments past season 1 anyway.\n\nI know before the reboot there were quite a quite few heartfelt moments related to Animaniacs-the climax of the Pinky and the Brain Christmas special, Dot’s fake out death (spoilers for a movie from over two decades ago-yes it’s that old get over it) in Wakko’s Wish…basically all of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo Clock”. But most of those aren’t actually in the original show, only one of them is. Wakko’s Wish is a non-canon (I swear “Animaniacs” and “canon” are two words that don’t mix but you get my point) movie and Pinky and the Brain series is a spin-off. If we’re talking exclusively about the original series that ran from 1993 to 1998, then only “One Flew Over the Cuckoo Clock” counts really.\n\nMaaaaaybe that one moment in Taming of the Screwy when Scratchy tells the Warners to leave…but it was really quick and not taken that seriously (it kinda just felt like build up for a punchline) so I think that one’s a stretch (although it was a little sad).\n\nMeanwhile the reboot already has caught up to it (in only 13 episodes as well) with two moments; Brain’s backstory in “Roadent Trip” and Yakko’s panic attack in “Fear and Laughter in Burbank”. They’re both taken seriously, last over a minute and say something pretty interesting about the characters involved. It’s just nice to see characters other than Rita and Runt be allowed to have emotional moments (again, within the actual show). It’s on-par with the original in this regard despite having 86 less episodes. And there’s probably more heartfelt moments to come!\n\n6. The Warner’s fangs:\n\nThey make them look a little more feral! 😁 Very fitting, I wish they had them originally now. I also appreciate that they (usually) don’t have gaps in their teeth anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE their TMS designs, but I honestly prefer the Warners with no gaps in their teeth.\n\n7. The PatB segments. Just in general, overall I like them more than in the original show (I’m comparing them to the ones in the original Animaniacs, I’m not talking about the PatB segments in the spin off series, Pinky an the Brain). Not only are they more creative, with ideas like Future Brain and Julia, they also do the running gag thing less. What I mean is, in the original show their segments sometimes would have a running gag they do over and over within a segment, to the point where it becomes obvious that gag is how/related to how the plan is gonna fail. Some examples of segments that do this are “Bubba Bo Bob Brain”, “Spellbound” and “Brain Meets Brawn”. Now of course we know they’re gonna fail, but trying to guess how they fail or the surprise how how they fail is one of the fun parts of their segments. Their segments are already quite formulaic, so why add to that? The reboot so far pretty much only did this once in “Close Encounters of the Worst Kind”, so that’s good.\n\n8. More variety in terms of musical genres. Most of the songs in the old show are of the old-school Broadway type of music. There’s a lot of orchestral music, a bit of jazz. Many songs just add lyrics to pre-existing music. Which is good, ‘cause those songs are good. But I appreciate the reboot adding some other genres in there, like pop and hip hop. They’re NOT what you’d expect an Animaniacs song to sound like, but they’re still amazing! (like The Cutening song or Yakko’s rap).\n\n9. The Warners’ morality. This one’s really important. Ideally, the Warners should act like karmic tricksters. Yeah they can be annoying to anybody, but are generally harmless and actually pretty friendly if left alone/aren’t being mistreated. Once someone actually provokes them though, they won’t hesitate to humiliate, harm and drive insane their “special friend”. This is explained well in “The Sound of Warners” (credit goes to clownmoontoon for the video):\n\nhttps://va.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_qnxp2bDmlE1r1jfup.mp4\n\nSometimes the Warners don’t even need to be the ones being provoked for them to go after someone for being a jerk, like in “Morning Malaise”, where they call out a radio show host for being rude to their guests, or in “Dot’s Entertainment”, where they call out a parody of Andrew Lloyd Webber for placing blame onto his actors.\n\nBut then in seasons 4 and 5 of the original show they start bothering people and legitimately harming people who literally weren’t being rude to them at all. Some examples of this are “Anchors Awarners”, “Acquaintances”, and “Back in Style”:\n\nI guess I can understand in “Back in Style”, they were mad about being sold off to other studios against their will, but they took it out on actors who probably had no say in the matter.\n\nThankfully, in the reboot they seem back to normal, once again only intentionally humiliating and/or harming people who actually provoked them, be it hunters (“Good Warner Hunting”,) cocky athletes, (“Gold Meddlers”), rude conductors (“Here Comes Treble”), etc.\n\n…and I think that’s all I got. There are other things too but they’re smaller points not really worth mentioning. I do like both series the same but wanted to praise the reboot specifically given that I have done multiple posts analysing the original show.\n\nSeason 2, here we come!"
