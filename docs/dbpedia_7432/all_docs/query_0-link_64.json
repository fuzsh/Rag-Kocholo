        "text": "Access savings on related medications\n\nYou probably know that feeling of pins and needles in your toes. It may happen after you sit for too long in one position or fold your legs in a new way. This kind of sensation comes on quickly and can be uncomfortable, but it also gets better as soon as you move your feet.\n\nLong-standing toe numbness or tingling that doesn’t ease with movement is something different. It can be a sign of an underlying health issue, such as a foot injury or even diabetes.\n\nHere we’ll review common medical causes of toe numbness and what clues this symptom may be able to give you about your health.\n\nSymptoms of toe numbness\n\nToe numbness is often described as a “pins and needles” sensation. But toe numbness can feel different for some people. You might experience symptoms like:\n\nTingling\n\nPrickling\n\nPain\n\nBurning sensation\n\nProblems sensing temperature\n\nWhat causes numbness in toes?\n\nThere are several reasons your toes can feel numb. But obdormition is what likely first springs to mind when you think of toe numbness. Obdormition is the medical term for when a part of your body “falls asleep.”\n\nObdormition develops when you put too much pressure on a nerve. This can happen if you sit in a certain position for too long, sleep in a certain way, or even wear shoes that are too tight. The body reacts to a compressed nerve by lowering how much blood it gets and by downgrading the signals it sends.\n\nThis leads to the “pins and needles” sensation (paresthesias) you get when your toes fall asleep. Paresthesias go away a few minutes after you relieve pressure on your nerves. Luckily, your nerves can handle a few hours of compression without getting damaged.\n\nBut some causes of toe numbness aren’t temporary, and they can lead to permanent nerve damage. “Peripheral neuropathy” is a type of nerve damage that develops when the communication between nerves and the brain stops working properly.\n\nThe toes are particularly sensitive to peripheral neuropathy — and here are a few reasons why:\n\nToes are far away from the trunk of the body, the home of the heart and spinal cord. Toes need long nerves (from the spinal cord) and long blood vessels (from the heart) to reach them. This distance leaves lots of room for possible damage to the nerves and vessels, which can lead to mixed signals and numbness.\n\nToes are the lowest part of the body. They’re at the mercy of gravity and take on a lot of strain from supporting the body. This translates to a higher risk of mechanical damage.\n\nFeet spend a lot of time in shoes, which can put pressure on them and cause damage.\n\nLet’s go through some of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy. These are in no particular order, and they can sometimes overlap.\n\n1. Diabetic neuropathy\n\nDiabetes is a common long-term (chronic) medical problem. It occurs when blood glucose levels are higher than what’s considered safe — for too long. High blood glucose levels can damage nerves (neuropathy). Because the nerves that communicate with your feet are the longest in your body, they’re some of the first nerves that diabetes affects.\n\nThe best way to prevent and treat diabetic neuropathy is to keep your blood glucose levels in your target range — with nutrition changes, regular physical activity, and medications when necessary.\n\n2. Other types of neuropathy\n\nThere are other forms of neuropathy (unrelated to diabetes) that can also affect the feet:\n\nA common culprit is a low level of vitamin B12, especially in people who follow a vegan diet or people with dietary limitations and restrictions.\n\nCardiovascular disease (peripheral arterial disease) can lead to nerve damage in the legs and feet.\n\nLong-term excess alcohol use can cause neuropathy through low levels of key vitamins.\n\nNeurologic diseases, like multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, can cause nerve damage.\n\nRare hereditary diseases, like Charcot-Marie-Tooth, can also cause neuropathy.\n\nCertain medications — like some for the treatment of cancer, HIV, chemotherapy, and heart disease — can all lead to serious nerve damage.\n\nSmall fiber neuropathy or SFN involves degeneration of some of the body’s small nerve fibers and can start with numb toes.\n\nPinched nerves in the lumbar spine (lower back) can be due to several conditions. These all result in sciatica, a compression of the sciatic nerve. That can lead to numbness of the big toe.\n\n3. Morton’s neuroma\n\nA neuroma is extra growth of nerve tissue where it shouldn’t be. Morton’s neuroma is a specific type of overgrown fiber on certain nerves in your feet. It most commonly affects the ball of the foot, between the third and fourth toes, where it presents as pain.\n\nPeople with Morton’s neuroma describe a burning sensation in the ball of their foot. Or it may feel like having a “pebble” in the shoe. Some people can also feel toe numbness. Luckily, this condition isn’t dangerous. People usually get better spontaneously. Sometimes a steroid injection in the foot can help.\n\n4. Metatarsalgia\n\nMetatarsalgia describes another kind of discomfort in the ball of the foot, specifically around the metatarsals — the bones in the feet that connect the midzone of the foot to the toes. People usually feel metatarsalgia between the second and fourth toes.\n\nMetatarsalgia can happen for a few different reasons. Increased pressure on the foot, plus an underlying feature that makes someone more likely to have an injury (arched or flat feet, unforgiving footwear, underlying joint disorders) can lead to metatarsalgia. It can cause pain, numbness, or tingling in the bottom of the feet.\n\nThe initial treatment consists of putting a “metatarsal pad” in your shoes. The pad relieves unwanted pressure by realigning the foot. You can get these without a prescription at your local drugstore. Most people improve with this small intervention.\n\n5. Tarsal tunnel syndrome\n\nYou may have heard of carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition that affects nerves in the hands and wrist. A similar thing can happen in the foot and ankle, and it’s called “tarsal tunnel syndrome.”\n\nIn tarsal tunnel syndrome, the main nerve that supplies the foot is compressed as it passes through the “tarsal tunnel,” a part of the ankle. This can lead to toe numbness and a burning type of pain, which is worse with long periods of standing or activity.\n\nTarsal tunnel pain and numbness usually improve with rest. Ankle braces can help to relieve the pressure and symptoms. If you still have bothersome symptoms, a surgical procedure that “releases” the nerves can help.\n\n6. Frostbite\n\nFrostbite occurs when cold temperatures outside the body damage tissues inside the body. The toes are particularly susceptible because they lose heat more easily than body parts closer to the trunk. When you’re in a cold environment, the first sign of frostbite can be a prickling sensation in the toes. This can progress to numbness, changes in skin color (to bright red, white, or blue), and even muscle and joint dysfunction that may make it hard to balance.\n\nYou can help to prevent frostbite when you’re in cold weather by taking extra precautions like keeping your toes dry and warm. Get inside to a warm and dry place if you start experiencing toe pain and numbness out in the cold. If you do develop frostbite, get medical help immediately. There are some medications and surgical procedures that can help. The quicker you get help with frostbite, the better.\n\n7. Injury\n\nIt can be easy to injure a foot, even without doing strenuous activity. And any injury to the joints and ligaments in the feet can disrupt the nerves and lead to numbness in the toes. Runners or hikers on long backpacking trips can damage their feet. All types of extreme exercise can put your feet at risk, too. Yet simply wearing shoes that are too tight can also lead to damage.\n\nOther foot injuries that can lead to toe numbness include:\n\nFoot or toe fractures from high-impact events like car accidents or falls\n\nStress fractures from repetitive activity\n\nBunions from pressure to the base of the big toe\n\n8. Shingles\n\nMany people got chickenpox in the past as a child. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. After a chickenpox infection, the virus goes into hiding in your nerves. People get shingles when the chickenpox virus reawakens, and it causes a painful rash. The rash can occur anywhere on your body.\n\nAfter the rash goes away, some people have persistent pain or numbness. That condition is called postherpetic neuralgia. This pain can last for months or years.\n\nYou can prevent shingles by getting the shingles vaccine. Or if you develop shingles, get treatment right away. You can lessen your chance of later complications if you take an antiviral medication within 3 days of when your symptoms start.\n\n9. Vasculitis or inflammation of the blood vessels\n\nVasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels. Autoimmune conditions, certain infections, and cancers can all trigger vasculitis.\n\nIf you develop vasculitis in your legs or feet, you can develop toe numbness along with other vasculitis symptoms. There’s treatment for vasculitis. Starting treatment as soon as possible can help get inflammation under control and ease symptoms like toe numbness.\n\n10. Raynaud’s phenomenon\n\nRaynaud’s phenomenon happens when the blood vessels in your extremities spasm, cutting off blood flow. It usually affects the fingers and toes. Common triggers include exposure to cold and stress.\n\nWhen people with Raynaud’s experience an “attack,” the toes and fingers turn white and then feel cold and numb. Fingers and toes can then turn purple or blue. Symptoms improve by warming up the affected body part. But the fingers and toes may become red and swollen as the symptoms disappear.\n\nThere are two types of Raynaud’s:\n\nPrimary: This type is more common. It has no known cause. It’s more common among women, those who smoke, and people younger than 30 years old.\n\nSecondary: This type is less common and occurs due to other medical conditions, certain medications, or environmental exposures like particular chemicals.\n\nPeople can prevent Raynaud’s attacks with several measures, such as:\n\nAvoid cold exposures and keep the hands and feet warm.\n\nManage stress since that can trigger attacks.\n\nQuit smoking, if you smoke.\n\nTreat other medical conditions that might cause your symptoms.\n\nShould I worry about numbness in my toes?\n\nIn general, temporary toe numbness isn’t a cause for concern. Especially if it goes away quickly once you get up and move around. But peripheral neuropathy is a sign of an underlying medical problem and needs treatment. Talk with your healthcare provider if you have frequent episodes of toe numbness.\n\nYou should get emergency medical care if you experience the following symptoms:\n\nMuscle weakness that makes it difficult to balance or walk\n\nNumbness that quickly moves up from your toes to your feet and even up your legs\n\nAny change in sensation that comes on quickly and occurs alongside other neurologic changes, like facial droop, new dizziness, severe headache, or changes in thinking\n\nChanges in sensation that occur after a head injury\n\nLoss of bladder or bowel control\n\nParalysis\n\nSlurred speech\n\nBreathing problems\n\nVision changes\n\nChronic or recurrent numbness that causes you concern\n\nWhat doctor should you see for numbness in your toes?\n\nA generalist — a healthcare provider who specializes in primary care — is a good place to start. They may recommend further testing and will know what specialist to refer you to, like a podiatrist or a neurologist:\n\nA podiatrist is a medical professional who goes to podiatry school to study feet. They can provide surgical and nonsurgical interventions to fix problems in the feet.\n\nA neurologist attends medical school and then does a residency that focuses on diseases of the brain and nerves. They can perform tests, like electromyography (EMG), to check how the nerves in the legs and feet are working. They also have specialized knowledge about medications that treat nerve conditions.\n\nTreatment options for numb toes\n\nThe treatment for numb toes depends on the cause. For example, the best way to prevent the worsening of numb toes from diabetes is managing your blood sugar levels. Let’s look at how to treat numb toes.\n\nClean and check your toes. If for any reason you have numb toes, you should carefully clean and check your toes at least once a day. This is to look for injury or infection that you may not feel.\n\nWear comfortable shoes. Another strategy to optimize your foot health is wearing orthopedic shoes, which are designed to support the foot and surrounding joints.\n\nApply capsaicin topical cream. Capsaicin is made from chili peppers. You can apply it to your skin to relieve pain, and it’s available over the counter as a cream or liquid. Be sure to talk with your healthcare provider about this treatment before using it. Capsaicin may not be right for you if you have peripheral neuropathy due to certain medical conditions.\n\nMassage your feet. Massaging your feet can increase blood flow to your toes and improve numbness.\n\nSoak in warm water or an Epsom salt bath. Warm water or Epsom salt soaks will help open blood vessels and increase blood flow to your toes.\n\nTry compression socks. Compression socks apply pressure to the lower legs, moving blood up toward the heart. That will increase circulation and can reduce numbness.\n\nStay active to increase blood flow. Physical activity increases circulation. Try walking, yoga, or biking. But check with your healthcare provider before starting an exercise program.\n\nTry physical therapy. A physical therapist can help you design an exercise program that will help promote circulation to ease pain and numbness.\n\nConsider surgery for pinched nerves. If you have a pinched nerve in your back causing toe numbness, surgery to stop nerve compression can relieve symptoms.\n\nTake medications. A wide variety of medications can provide relief from your symptoms. Talk with your healthcare provider about the most appropriate medication for your condition.\n\nMake dietary changes or try a supplement. Diabetes and some vitamin deficiencies can cause numb toes. Managing blood sugar levels and taking supplements to make up for vitamin deficiencies can reduce symptoms.\n\nIf you’re having foot discomfort, don’t ignore it. Your feet are telling you that they need a change. The discomfort can get worse, and numbness can develop if you don’t make some changes. Take a break from any high-impact physical activity, like running or jumping, until your feet and toes feel better.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe toes are a common part of the body to become numb. If the numbness or tingling doesn’t improve, then there’s probably an underlying medical reason. Make an appointment to discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider. The treatment that’s best for you will depend on the cause, so your healthcare provider will help get to the bottom of your symptoms. In many cases, medical attention can help to improve symptoms, or at least stop things from getting worse."
