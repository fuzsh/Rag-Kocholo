        "text": "What it is\n\nDown syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra copy of chromosome 21. Chromosomes are small \"packages\" of genes in the body's cells, which determine how the body forms and functions.\n\nWhen babies are growing, the extra chromosome changes how their body and brain develop. This can cause both physical and mental challenges.\n\nPeople with Down syndrome often have developmental challenges, such as being slower to learn to speak than other children.\n\nDistinct physical signs of Down syndrome are usually present at birth and become more apparent as the baby grows. They can include facial features, such as:\n\nA flattened face, especially the bridge of the nose\n\nAlmond-shaped eyes that slant up\n\nA tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth\n\nOther physical signs can include:\n\nA short neck\n\nSmall ears, hands, and feet\n\nA single line across the palm of the hand (palmar crease)\n\nSmall pinky fingers\n\nPoor muscle tone or loose joints\n\nShorter-than-average height\n\nSome people with Down syndrome have other medical problems as well. Common health problems include:\n\nCongenital heart defects\n\nHearing loss\n\nObstructive sleep apnea\n\nDown syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition diagnosed in the United States. Each year, about 5,700 babies born in the US have Down syndrome.1\n\nKeep Reading: Living with Down Syndrome\n\nTypes\n\nThere are three types of Down syndrome. The physical features and behaviors are similar for all three types.\n\nTrisomy 21\n\nWith Trisomy 21, each cell in the body has three separate copies of chromosome 21. About 95% of people with Down syndrome have Trisomy 21.\n\nTranslocation Down syndrome\n\nIn this type, an extra part or a whole extra chromosome 21 is present. However, the extra chromosome is attached or \"trans-located\" to a different chromosome rather than being a separate chromosome 21. This type accounts for about 3% of people with Down syndrome.\n\nMosaic Down syndrome\n\nMosaic means mixture or combination. In this type, some cells have three copies of chromosome 21, but other cells have the typical two copies. People with mosaic Down syndrome may have fewer features of the condition. This type accounts for about 2% of people with Down syndrome.\n\nRisk factors\n\nWe don't know for sure why Down syndrome occurs or how many different factors play a role. We do know that some things can affect your risk of having a baby with Down syndrome.\n\nOne factor is your age when you get pregnant. The risk of having a baby with Down syndrome increases with age, especially if you are 35 years or older when you get pregnant.234\n\nHowever, the majority of babies with Down syndrome are still born to mothers less than 35 years old. This is because there are many more births among younger women.56\n\nRegardless of age, parents who have one child with Down syndrome are at an increased risk of having another child with Down syndrome.7\n\nScreening and diagnosis\n\nThere are two types of tests available to detect Down syndrome during pregnancy: screening tests and diagnostic tests. A screening test can tell you if your pregnancy has a higher chance of being affected Down syndrome. Screening tests don't provide an absolute diagnosis.\n\nSee Also: Screening for Birth Defects\n\nDiagnostic tests can typically detect if a baby will have Down syndrome, but they carry more risk. Neither screening nor diagnostic tests can predict the full impact of Down syndrome on a baby.\n\nSee Also: Diagnosing Birth Defects\n\nResources\n\nThe views of these organizations are their own and do not reflect the official position of CDC.\n\nDown Syndrome Resource Foundation (DSRF): The DSRF supports people living with Down syndrome and their families with individualized and leading-edge educational programs, health services, information resources, and rich social connections so each person can flourish in their own right.\n\nGiGi's Playhouse: GiGi's Playhouse provides free educational, therapeutic-based, and career development programs for individuals with Down syndrome, their families, and the community, through a replicable playhouse model.\n\nGlobal Down Syndrome Foundation: This foundation is dedicated to significantly improving the lives of people with Down syndrome through research, medical care, education and advocacy.\n\nNational Association for Down Syndrome: The National Association for Down Syndrome supports all persons with Down syndrome in achieving their full potential. They seek to help families, educate the public, address social issues and challenges, and facilitate active participation.\n\nNational Down Syndrome Society (NDSS): NDSS seeks to increase awareness and acceptance of those with Down syndrome."
