        "text": "Animaniacs Issue 1:\n\nI’m only going to review the Pinky and the Brain stories of this comic. Although I do like the story where the Animaniacs take too long to make a wish on a genie, usually I find them too annoying and they aren’t annoying someone who deserves all of that. Brain tells Pinky that tonight the United Nations is having a fundraiser ball attended by world leaders, which he learned about from the newspaper.\n\nPinky says that when he gets an idea, it’s painful, which only makes sense if he means that Brain hits him for bad ideas, most of the time. Brain reminds Pinky of when they had to abort the space mission, and Pinky shows compassion for him. Brain tells him to stop crying, as he uses his tail to pick the lock of his cage. He says he had saved the laughing gas from his earlier plan for this. Somehow, he expects me to believe that the laughing gas only works at exactly 95 degrees.\n\nHe says a joke must ignite the gas. You mean he can’t just spray the laughing gas? That’s what it’s for. He doesn’t HAVE to have people thinking they’re laughing because of a joke. He carries a huge book of the Acme catalog, and says they need supplies, and Pinky checks off something. Brain says that once the leaders would get frozen by the laughing gas, he plans on making life-size models of them and inserting electronic chips made from his own DNA into the models’ heads.\n\nWhy doesn’t he put those chips in the actual leaders, and how would you make electronic chips from DNA? So he plans on replacing the world leaders. Why don’t the Freedom Fighters in Archie Sonic do that to Eggman’s sub-bosses? They could just replace them with robots.\n\nPinky says they need a disguise to get into the U.N. It’d only be a bad disguise. I thought they were gonna sneak in because that’s what mice are small enough to do. Somehow Brain thinks the only way is for them to pretend to be vulgar rock musicians. How is there a warning on a box saying to not use wax with laughing gas?\n\nBrain would know better than to talk in needlessly big words to the deliveryman instead of just asking if he wants him to sign the papers, which he’d know he does, because he’s supposed to be smart. Why would Brain call containers of his “ sinister-looking? “ He tells the Acme deliveryman to direct the cases of wax and gas containers to the United Nations.\n\nBrain says that while he’s gonna distract the crowd with a joke, he wants Pinky to turn up the heat and release the gas. He says he’ll have only 30 seconds or the gas would become ineffective. So it’s already too obvious that the plan would fail because he’s not the type to make funny jokes. Pinky could make someone laugh a lot easier.\n\nBrain goes to a store and there’s no reason Pinky would be able to find clothes in his size and Brain shouldn’t be able to find a wig in his size. They should’ve just made them. The next evening, they’re allowed to walk towards the UN building because they’re dressed like rock stars, and someone tells them they must be the band’s roadies. So he already hired a band and Brain must have known that, so that’s why they’re doing this.\n\nSome people call Brain and Pinky mice, so at least they can see that, but then they say mice are cool. Nobody would think that and no one would think they’re normal mice, considering how they’re dressed. This would make more sense if they knew they weren’t normal mice and THAT’S why they think it’s cool, and they’re just playing dumb.\n\nBrain lies to one of them that the last two bands who played here spontaneously combusted. Somehow the entire band believes him and runs away, without asking anyone at the building if that’s true. The first time could’ve been believable, but he stretched believability by saying two.\n\nThe gullible moron thanks Brain for the warning, and when Brain and Pinky are expected to play for an audience, Brain has the clever idea to play a CD and only pretend to be singing, but the record skips. Pinky enjoys it anyways because he doesn’t care too much if the plan succeeds, and he gets hit and apologizes to Brain saying he’ll fix it. Brain tells him it’s time to turn up the heat.\n\nThen it turns out he was smart enough to rely on Pinky to tell a joke. Of course, Pinky’s not reliable either but he’s way funnier than Brain. Pinky tells people it’s lovely to see them looking so fancy tonight. He’s oddly relatable here, and has to be reminded to tell a joke because he’s forgetful. He says knock knock and then he says, “ Who’s where? “ for no reason.\n\nHis name is called out and he says , “ Pinky who? “ for no reason, and then Brain says help. This could’ve been avoided if Pinky had already had a joke prepared. So someone laughs in the audience, and the rest of it laughs too, which actually makes sense because she’d be laughing at how stupid Pinky’s coming off as. They might be thinking it’s all intentional, and the reason laugh tracks were invented was because hearing laughter at a joke makes other people more likely to laugh.\n\nThen it cuts ahead to Pinky trying to have fun by singing while he’s slathering, and Brain ends up surrounded by wax models, but the models don’t have all of the same colors as the actual world leaders, so he should know to do something about that. There’s a rumble and the models explode, Pinky wastes time stating the obvious for no reason, and Brain reads the warning that using wax with laughing gas causes spontaneous combustion.\n\nBut why would anyone even know that and make a warning about it? Pinky says the world leaders are unfreezing, so of course Brain decides to leave because they aren’t welcome here anymore. At least the plan failed after he made the audience laugh instead of them failing to even make them laugh and just humiliating themselves.\n\nThis story by Amy Weingartner was about Brain and Pinky sneaking into a UN meeting disguised as a rocker, releasing laughing gas that somehow needs a funny joke to activate it, and making wax models of the world leaders there, in a plan to replace them with them using electronic chips. And I don’t know why they don’t put the chips in the world leaders to begin with while they’re frozen.\n\nBut the wax models explode because Brain didn’t know about the warning not to have laughing gas around them. While it took a while for the audience to start laughing, I’m glad it didn’t get to the point where they booed at them, because I thought I’d see Brain embarrass himself trying and failing to be funny, and instead he made the right call in having Pinky try to be funny, even if he should’ve known to have Pinky write down a joke to say ahead of time.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 2:\n\nPinky gets enthusiastic about watching TV and quotes it. I wonder why he did it more than once because he should’ve known it’d get Brain mad. Brain says he’ll demonstrate his plan and pulls down a paperclip hanging from a rubber band, causing it to bounce from thing to thing causing damage in the lab that would be blamed on someone, until eventually it goes into the cage’s lock.\n\nBut why couldn’t Brain have just used his tail as the key again? It really does have Negative Continuity. I guess he just wanted to show off how good he is at math. Pinky compliments him, and Brain says the world will be his after he constructs a machine so poorly named that it gives no indication of what it does. I guess the reason he’s gonna waste time explaining how his machine works to Pinky is that he’s lonely. He can’t explain it to anyone else.\n\nHe says that by depleting hydrogen and promoting gravitational collapse, he’ll produce a magnetic charge so strong, that everyone with loose change will be magnetically stuck to the ground. It’s a nice gesture of him that he says “ we will, “ instead of “ I will, “ as if Pinky made the invention too, not that it really makes up for his unprovoked abuse of him like rolling him up in a blueprint.\n\nPinky compliments him, but then says that people could take off their pants, and Brain says they’ll have to take over the world quickly, then. Yeah, they’d have only a couple of seconds. Other than the embarrassment if it’s in public, there’s not much stopping most people from just taking them off.\n\nHe doesn’t even say what he’ll do to keep himself in power after getting to the president’s chair, with everyone too stuck to the ground to carry out his orders. So like with a lot of his plans to cause chaos to take over the world, it’s a Missing Steps Plan.\n\nBrain says they need one item to complete the project, an item with a non-indicative name, and it’s expensive. And he doesn’t have the resources to just make it? Pinky wonders where they’re going to get that kind of money.\n\nThen he hears a buzzing sound and hears someone apologize and say someone’s incorrect on the TV, and mention that the person could’ve won a lot of money. What a coincidence that it’s the exact amount of money they need. It’s possible but it’d still be better writing if it was more because that’s more believable.\n\nBrain says he’ll go on that quiz show. Pinky warns him that the questions are really hard. Your first instinct would be to wonder why he says this because you’d assume that Brain would do a great job at the show, because he’s full of knowledge, and so Pinky should have faith in him.\n\nBut then Pinky asks him a pop culture question, and Brain just says he doesn’t care in response. This implies that he’d do terribly at the show any time pop culture questions are involved, and his only chance would be if he could get Pinky to answer those questions for him whenever he wants. I guess he assumes he’ll NEVER be asked pop culture questions, and he assumes Pinky only asked that because he was watching the show recently and he’s crazy.\n\nBrain then wastes time going under a shoe and getting to the top of his human mecha suit which still insists on having his head sticking out of it. I always hate that. Why doesn’t he have what’d look like a human head over the mecha and have its face capable of moving just like a real one, lip-synching and emoting like he does, when he could invent anything?\n\nWhy does he think he should use this to blend in, when it just makes him stick out even MORE? And most of the time people are willing to accept him at his real size, even undisguised. So it’s better for him to look like a magical talking mouse instead, while most people would scream at seeing this, so he’ll be lucky that every human he’ll see will have nerves of steel.\n\nBrain walks the suit around and gets a taxi, and shockingly the story cuts past showing us how Brain got on the quiz show. That was easy. The host of it calls Brain “ Brian “ by mistake because it’s a more expected name, and he might have assumed it was a typo. This part of the story’s boring because it’s just him expecting Brain to answer useless trivia. You’d think he wouldn’t know all of it, because he specializes in engineering and science. How would he know the three Yappian Island neighbors?\n\nThen he’s asked the same question Pinky asked him at the start of the story, and even though he was told the answer, he didn’t commit it to memory because it was something Pinky said. So he doesn’t know the answer and loses the quiz show. You’d think he wouldn’t have made it that far. Why would it take so long for even one pop culture question to happen?\n\nAnd the story’s already over. He should’ve won the quiz show. Seeing people get stuck to the road only to remove their pants to foil his plan would’ve been a little funnier than this ending, which was predictable as well but without enough visual humor.\n\nThis story by Peter Hastings was about Brain going on a quiz show to get money, and after he does ridiculously well even though not every question would be within his field of interest, when it’s not like he showed an AI all the episodes in fast forward and had it download all the answers for him, predictably he loses because of a pop culture question, but it was tacky that it was literally the exact same question Pinky gave him. What are the chances of that?\n\nHe could’ve lost because it was a new question he was given, that his AI didn’t study for. Sure, it’s been a little while since he got the answer, but still, it was a mistake to make THAT the question, because the fact that he’s heard the answer before and Pinky’s watched that show in front of him and enjoyed it enough to quote it, makes it less believable that he didn’t know the answer. It’s too bad for Brain that he couldn’t have Pinky as a partner that he could call on for the answer, and that we didn’t even get to SEE how he got ON the show.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 3:\n\nIt starts out with Pinky watching a cartoon on a TV across from his cage where a mouse is about to be hit by an anvil. He must have good reason to hate the mouse if he’s not rooting for him just because he’s a mouse. Why is there a TV right across from a cage of lab mice in someone else’s lab, anyways?\n\nWhy would there be a TV there to distract any lab workers? Brain asks how he could hope to conquer a world where mice are always portrayed as buffoons. Tom and Jerry has the mouse always come out on top. But these two mostly see this instead.\n\nBrain complains that mice are seen as pests, and then he sees a show where someone’s asked if he’s a man or a mouse and he takes offense to that. Brain says he’ll have to do something to fix the image problem of mice. There’s no way he’d be able to do that without brainwashing. Mickey Mouse didn’t. So TV mice couldn’t do that.\n\nAfter he throws the remote control at the TV, it completely shatters its glass, implying that he’s got super strength. He says the time to adjust his image is long past, tells Pinky to give him a wrench, and says they need to go to the past with casual time travel. How incompetent is he that he hasn’t taken over the world despite having a time machine? Well it’s believable because of how much he’s failed already.\n\nHe wants to reinvent the rodent as a ruler of men by going back several million years. That’s a very ambitious goal. Pinky sees a caveman and Brain’s delusional, thinking he could teach him anything, when you’d think he’d know that cavemen couldn’t speak his language. There’s no reason the caveman would eat one of the cards instead of trying to club Pinky right away. At least Brain prevents him from getting clubbed.\n\nPinky says he was about to teach him 51 card pick-up. He should know that wouldn’t impress anyone. Pinky’s seemingly useless comment causes Brain to run after him with a book to hit him and end up seeing a caveman painting on a wall, and Brain assumes that this means he has a sense of history, when he could just be doing this for fun.\n\nPinky thinks, “ Leave it to Brain to drag us to the world’s only museum, “ while he looks annoyed. That’s pretty rare. Other than the episode from his point of view, since when do we EVER get to know what he’s thinking, let alone learn that he’s thinking of Brain in a snarky way?\n\nBrain jumps to the conclusion that this one artist has a lot of influence on culture, so he assumes that if he were to get painted there, mice would get a better perception, because he’s completely desperate. Most mice still steal so much food from people and startle so many people that one mouse being painted on a wall wouldn’t make a difference.\n\nAll Brain has to do is talk to this guy and he runs away screaming, which makes no sense because a caveman would just try to kill him for food. The same logic applying to why he’d do this also applies to all the other humans and THEY don’t run away screaming. It’s especially confusing because that was written to almost happen to Pinky. So that one was especially brave.\n\nIt cuts ahead in time and we see that Pinky painted black images of Brain’s head all over the place. Why is he using black paint instead of white? Why does he do that instead of painting pictures that look like Brain’s face?\n\nAnd Brain assumes that’ll benefit him instead of making humanity afraid of mice in one place, assuming that the appearance of one mouse magically caused this, and even then this would quickly end up being brushed off as something that was made up as history goes on, and be ditched as a silly superstition, after all of the other times people would see mice and not see images of a mouse’s head pop up everywhere. These people would assume Brain himself is magical but not all mice.\n\nSo them assuming this about Brain must be why the mouse silhouette image is everywhere in his altered present day. Pinky tells Brain that he’s not great-looking. It’s rare to see him directly insult him. It’s even more rare that he doesn’t get hit by Brain for it. Why does the cop kick the TV and say move it as if he hasn’t seen the actual Brain right there in a clearly broken TV? Why is he talking to a broken TV, or the mice in it, either way?\n\nBrain tells Pinky to get his name so that he could court-martial him. Gee, I wonder if he’s not gonna like it here? He sees a parade where people celebrate a made-up rat called Rickee Rat instead of one looking like him, for some reason. It took a while for me to realize this was supposed to be Mickey Mouse. It ruins the joke having him not be called Mickey Mouse, because instead it comes off as completely random. An Animaniacs story had someone look way more like Mickey Mouse just fine.\n\nPinky looks on the bright side, enjoying the song, but Brain says he didn’t want a future ruled by THAT rodent, even though it’s a fictional one, so it’s not one that’s any competition. If anything this would make it easier for him to take over the world because he did succeed in making people like mice more, somehow.\n\nThe story ends with him sawing down the signs saying how many feet it is to get to Rodent Republic that are too close together somehow. At least there’s no indication that he undid what he did using the time machine, so technically his plan was a success.\n\nThis story by John Walker is about Brain noticing that mice have an image problem and wanting to change that to make it easier to be elected the leader, and going back in time to have Pinky paint silhouettes of his head all over the place, instead of just using brainwashing to change people’s minds about mice.\n\nSomehow, even though someone saw him, so he’d be able to describe to the other cavemen exactly what Brain looked like, the altered timeline has everyone dedicating a parade to worshipping a fictional mouse named Ricky, whose name rhymes with Mickey. You’d think plenty of people would’ve seen Brain when Pinky was doing that painting, in broad daylight, and they’d constantly have to run away from them.\n\nMice constantly make themselves known as nothing but food stealers, not to mention they spread diseases, so that’s the image they’d always have because the amounts of times they’d steal food would make people forget about this. It’s believable that cavemen would think mice are supernatural because these images showed up and no human took credit for it, but with mice being known as pests, this would cause them to be seen as the bad kind of supernatural being, as in they’d be seen as demons.\n\nIt makes no sense that humanity started to and continued to worship mice that far into the future, because this was one instance in a time long before written language, and even if it was painted about on murals, most people don’t believe that the supernatural events described in ancient religions or stories actually happened just because some used to believe in them.\n\nSo the claim that someone saw Pinky paint these images would be dismissed as a lie later on, and people would go on to assume a human did it as a prank and didn’t admit it. Technically Brain succeeded in this issue for once, improving the image of mice like he said he wanted, but he ended the story miserable because he wasn’t put in charge of the world.\n\nThat’s because for no reason Pinky merely painted silhouettes of his head everywhere instead of painting images that actually look like his face. We KNOW cavemen in this story aren’t restricted to just one color of paint, so he probably could’ve done that and Brain would’ve won.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 4:\n\nSome people ask a scientist if Acme Labs has been receiving alien telecommunications. He says that it’s true, and already his planet is a winner in the clearing house sweepstakes, and some new mice will be delivering his entry tomorrow. Brain feels insulted because he wasn’t picked when he’s older, and this time all he has to do is kick open the door.\n\nSince he never does that, it’s not like he usually has super strength, or he’d be taking advantage of it all the time, so it’s more likely that he did something to weaken the door first. Pinky’s nice to him, complimenting his word, and Brain wants to give those mice a piece of his mind.\n\nThen someone says those reporters bought that cosmic clearing house story, and he says that once they make this deal, they’ll see serious cosmic house clearing. The only way there would be sentient people on Venus would be if they were supernatural enough to survive it, and lived underground so that’s why we haven’t seen them. It’d make more sense if it was a planet outside of our galaxy.\n\nDr. Comet says this Venusian mega mind-blinder sounds like it could do great brainwashing, and he can’t figure out why they’re making them send mice to pick up the parts. Me, neither, because it’d only make sense if they knew about Brain, and the aliens would’ve requested him then.\n\nAt least this time Brain doesn’t punish Pinky for not thinking what he was thinking, but I shouldn’t have to compliment that. He says he’ll need translation to communicate with normal mice. Why does he think Pinky could translate? Pinky’s only speaking in English too. Back at Brain’s cage, we see the normal mice going after cheese, and Brain keeps Pinky from going after it too by stepping on his tail, and walks away from the cage with them in it. He says they need to watch their cholesterol and predictably wants to go to Venus.\n\nBrain tells Pinky to shut up because they need to keep a low profile as their cage is being carried by someone, but obviously this cage is soundproof if he and the scientist can’t hear them. Not to mention the fact that these so-called mice are reading already makes it obvious that they’re the two genius mice. So these guys must know that THEY replaced the regular mice, and they just don’t mind because why would they?\n\nBrain’s incompetent anyways. And why would they think having just helmets on the mice would be enough to protect them from Venus? And yet it tries to be realistic by having their rocket take a few hours. But it wouldn’t be just a few hours either.\n\nBrain uses a special Acme Glass Breaker, floats towards a control panel, and Pinky hopes Brain really is steering the rocket towards Venus. Brain says he’s taking a short-cut. Why are the magic gravity boots trapped in a vending machine that regular mice couldn’t operate anyways?\n\nBrain planned on Pinky having the money for them, and they walk on Venus, but they’re perfectly fine, somehow. The only way this would make any kind of sense is if their helmets had a witch’s spell on them to protect the whole body. It’s obvious the story doesn’t care about making sense, so it’s a good thing it’s so engaging. Brain ends up seeing a flag advertising a sale on what he’s looking for sticking out of a crater, tied to a periscope.\n\nWe see that the Venusians don’t really look like you’d expect, but at least that’s creative. Brain greets them saying that he comes in peace and Pinky falls saying that he almost came in pieces. I like that play on words, but I’m officially sick of the rushed or lazy coloring. Why are so many of the panels not bothering to properly color in the main characters? That should be top priority.\n\nPinky calls the Venusians felines, but it’s a miracle he thought that because they just looked like vague animal people to me. They don’t need to have anything in common with cats to be mean to Brain and Pinky on sight. The explanation that they’re just racist against a species they’re unfamiliar with would be more believable.\n\nThey hit the mice with a spoon one after the other, and Brain removes his space boots and tells Pinky to do the same. So they float away from them, and return to the rocket. Brain complains that the mega mind-blinder was just a ploy, and then he breaks off a part of the control panel by accident and says it’s the fault of shoddy construction. A part of a spaceship’s control panel wouldn’t be built THAT badly. It’s a miracle that they made it back to Earth, complete with parachutes.\n\nThis story by John Walker is about Pinky and Brain making sure they get to go on a rocket to Venus to get brainwashing technology from the aliens that magically live there. For no reason some regular mice were gonna be sent there, instead of the mouse that caused a lot of people problems trying to take over the Earth. The scientists must still value Pinky and Brain just because they’re genetically engineered, because if they wanted them dead, they’d have easily killed them by now.\n\nBut the scientist didn’t know he was sending these mice on a suicide mission, so he would’ve sent Pinky and Brain because they’re so obviously smarter than them, and if he didn’t send them because he didn’t want Brain to get brainwashing technology then he would’ve freaked out at seeing Brain in the cage.\n\nBrain’s plan fails because there was no brainwasher and instead the Venusians just wanted to eat them, and lied to try to get mice in particular because they’re apparently similar to cats. That was a creative twist, and it makes sense, explaining why mice were wanted. So it was an engaging story, even if it was too lazy to explain why the helmets alone helped them survive Venus, so I have to assume a witch’s spell is on them. But it’s still interesting.\n\nSo the biggest problem with it is in the art. It’s constantly distracting how amateurish the coloring is. Why are Pinky and Brain constantly not colored in right? A thing the comic does sometimes is go a couple of issues without a Pinky and the Brain story. The next Pinky and the Brain story’s in Issue 8, so a lot of people must have been disappointed by the next few issues not having them with no warning. It’s not like you can look at the cover every time and know if Pinky and the Brain are in it.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 8:\n\nBrain exhausts Pinky by forcing him to run on a spinning globe just for the sake of a demonstration he doesn’t need to do. Brain holds a magnet attached to string tied to the top of the globe, and says that when he builds his new invention and throws it from the North Pole, the cable will become “ taut “ in seconds, and he somehow thinks gravity will cease and everyone will fly off the face of Earth, and somehow he thinks that’ll leave him and Pinky alone to seize control. Of WHAT, a civilization without people?\n\nSo far his plans in the Animaniacs comic have been delusional every time, and while Pinky doesn’t talk like he’s the genius, Brain seems more insane than him. This is Out of Character, because most of the time he’d never make a plan that involves omnicide, and if he was the type to kill someone, he’d have already done it. And maybe he would’ve succeeded in a few of his plans. The Animaniacs 2020 show had him be darker than usual, but THIS is ridiculous, like this is a whole other universe from that.\n\nIt’s also Out of Character of Pinky to be fine with this. He shows compassion a lot. Instead he calls his plan brilliant even though they were bored with having the Earth to themselves in one episode, and all he does is ask what’ll keep THEM from flying off the Earth. It could make sense that he doesn’t care about this dangerous plan if it’s because he assumes he’ll never get that far. But usually he’s not shy at all about telling him he’s opposed to what he’s planning.\n\nBrain says they’ll be duct-taped to a tree but if his plan involves gravity in general ceasing, why would only people fly off the Earth? Why wouldn’t the ground itself be spun off it from its rotational force as well? He’d know this wouldn’t work because he’s a genius. This would only make sense if he went crazy and no longer cared about ruling the world and just wanted to get everyone killed, including himself, but even then, how would that happen?\n\nThis plan would only be believable of a robot Brain of Snowball’s who’d replace him to frame him, and even then he wouldn’t risk it actually working since it’d kill him too. Brain says that they need money to buy a billion ton magnet. I assumed he was planning to make it, if he bothered to even talk about this plan. Why would he think he could ever buy a magnet like that?\n\nHe says as he’s using a sewing machine for once that he wants to win a one million dollar purse from the biggest horse race of the year. Well first off, it’s not “ billion dollar, “ it’s “ million dollar. “ So if it’s just gonna be another money-making scheme, he could’ve easily had taking over the world as his end goal as usual, so why didn’t the writer leave out the part where he talked about his plan with the magnet, then? He’s never gonna get that far.\n\nBrain and Pinky are written to quote lines from the show, and then I have to assume there was a time skip to explain Brain suddenly wearing a different outfit. Pinky compliments him, and somehow changes his body to look different for fun. So in this other universe where Brain’s pure evil, he’s genetically engineered to be able to do this. It can’t be the case in other stories or else he would’ve taken advantage of his flexibility.\n\nBrain quotes the show again, telling him to stop goofing off or he’ll have to hurt him, but this time it makes no sense because that’s what he’s doing already. Sadly there’s no explanation for how they get all the way to Kentucky in time, so I have to assume they used a super fast little plane Brain invented.\n\nBrain says near the stables that by analyzing, he’ll find a horse that’s guaranteed to win the race. He’s too confident here. It’s all down to luck. That’s what Harvest Moon taught me. How did the horse say, “ narf? “ I assume the reason Brain didn’t question this is that he just assumes that it was genetically engineered.\n\nBrain says that by combining the statistics and his low body weight, the horse he’s picked can’t lose even though it clearly looks angry at him, so it can’t be trusted. And Pinky and the horse somehow look in love. This is just to reference the show as well, unless it’s a coincidence, and either way it never made sense because the horse isn’t sentient. Pinky apologizes for getting distracted, and Brain says he’ll take the place of a real jockey.\n\nA jockey for the horse he picked gets a phone call from Brain who tells him he’s just won ten million dollars, and the jockey believes him and says he’s out of here, and runs out of the building, which wouldn’t happen. He’d ask him where he won it from and be suspicious of the good news.\n\nBrain gets asked to replace him because there’s no one else to do it and he’s thanked for it. It doesn’t seem in-character for Brain to casually start singing. It’s more like Pinky. Then he sees Pinky on the horse and complains that his extra weight wasn’t accounted for in his calculations. I assume this makes sense because Pinky’s too used to always being around him and forgot that the plan didn’t involve him being with him this time.\n\nEventually the race starts and Pinky ends up thrown off the horse. At least THAT was realistic. We don’t see Pinky get stomped on for some reason, and as soon as I got told that Pinky’s favorite horse trailed far behind, I wondered if the horse would backfire on Brain. When Phar looks at Pinky, her inexplicable crush somehow causes her to go much faster to eventually grab his tail and win the race when you’d think every horse in the race would already always be running at top speed anyways.. And Brain has some completely stilted response to that. At least the money went to someone deserving.\n\nThis story by Peter Hastings ends up being about Brain trying to win a horse race for money, and he fails because of the complete nonsense that Pinky and another horse fell in love, and so it sped up just for him. Money-making schemes of Brain’s are a dime a dozen. The most noteworthy thing about the story is Brain being mischaracterized as an omnicidal maniac all of a sudden instead of wanting to run the world, and Pinky was equally Out of Character by being happy with that, and there was no explanation for this to justify it, not even a textbox at the start saying that this is a different universe. So that was jarring.\n\nHow does he not realize it’s pointless to assume control of a world with nobody on it, when he doesn’t know any other planets with sentient life to rule, since there’s no continuity? If there was, he could want to rule Venus, but it’s still Out of Character for him to plan on killing anyone, because Snowball stays alive. The art and dialogue at the start should’ve been different, I don’t know HOW that got past the editing.\n\nAnd even if being duct-taped to a tree didn’t send him off the planet, how does he plan on escaping that tree to do what he wants without flying off to his death as soon as he does? But at least it was an expendable part of the story because he never got anywhere near achieving that goal.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 9:\n\nBrain states the obvious to Pinky that the ducks are laughing while they’re in tuxedos for some reason. The ducks wouldn’t act in a human way like this unless they were genetically engineered. And he says, “ victory’s in the air, “ instead of thinking they’re laughing at him. It’s nice to see him appreciate something too easily. Then the story finally starts with Brain telling Pinky in his cage that he’s been making a laughing serum using helium of all things.\n\nPinky explains what he was laughing at the TV for, and says this guy told a joke in a big room to a bunch of other people. Brain plans on using his laughing serum on Washington DC’s water supply to make the world at his mercy. But some people there would only drink bottled water. He’s at least smart enough to realize that the amount of serum needed would be too much for them to transport alone.\n\nAnd somehow he walks into a fancy restaurant housing nothing but talking mice with tables at their size. Suddenly there’s THAT many genetically engineered mice. The confusing thing is that this restaurant exists for them on normal human Earth. Brain must have had it made. Also he could’ve just flown a toy helicopter he made to be like a real helicopter and had the serum in it. So he could just fly to the water supply himself and not need to get extra help.\n\nWhy does Brain think the three mice in tuxedos are the unsavory type? Lots of people wear tuxedos. Why does Brain call them unsavory types to their faces if he’s trying to get their help? The mice happily agree to help Brain because they’re not doing anything else tonight. Then if it’s that easy, he should do this a lot more often, provided that they don’t have much dialogue. Sure they’re stupid and have too much faith in him to be a good ruler, but that’s just what he wants from a minion, and that’s the only thing unsavory about them.\n\nHe was completely confident he could get their help, so it’s not like he never thought they’d agree. When I called them stupid, I was right because they didn’t know he wanted to take over the world, and one of them thought destiny was a person, and another one is the stupidest of all by somehow thinking Destiny is Alabama’s sister. The shortest one there is the unsavory type by not believing in tipping, but Brain didn’t know that.\n\nWhy does Brain think that having him and Pinky dress the same as all of those other mice “ eases anonymity? ” Brain’s head shape wouldn’t be anonymous unless this was his first plan in the area. He has a stupid line as well telling the rodents “ let’s get to rodenting! “ It was nice of Pinky to say that’s a very stylish look for him, so he shouldn’t have told him he’s trying to ignore him.\n\nThe only way Pinky was being dumb was that this isn’t Brain’s style of fashion. He’s not cool enough for it because he’s really serious and uses big words too much. Brain should know that it’s a waste of time for them all to use code names to be more anonymous. If they’re not all well-known as it is, which is already a stretch since they’re talking mice, then they’re already anonymous.\n\nAnd how did Brain come up with their code names? This is needless effort. His code name for Pinky is really lazy, but at least that’s less effort to waste time, so that’s the smartest name of all. If his own code name is as lazy as Mr. Brain, he should know that there’s no point in bothering with it because anyone who’d know about him would see through it anyways.\n\nBrain tells the mice carrying his serum that their efforts will be rewarded when he comes to power. He should know better than to insult them calling their efforts meager, though, because he’s lucky they’re helping him.\n\nOut of nowhere a cop wearing an inexplicably green outfit confronts them on this. He says it’s midnight. Then his life sure sucks, having to work at midnight. It’s smart of the mice other than Brain to instantly think of a lie for what they’re up to. One says they’re bringing their granny medicine. Brain tells the cop the truth, and he says “ Well I guess that’s okay! “ This would make sense if he was doing this because he has no faith in them to succeed, but he doesn’t know what that serum does.\n\nYou’d think he’d take IT seriously and just take it away. So maybe he does think they’ll succeed and is just so opposed to his own government that he’s fine with letting them do this. I dunno why people think people don’t believe him. If they didn’t believe him, they’d think he’s crazy, and they’d call him out on it and make fun of him sometimes.\n\nThe confusing thing is that he says, “ You crazy mice are always up to something! “ and he walks away. The only reason he’d say mice are always up to something is if he had already heard about Brain, so he knows about some of his past adventures and finds them amusing. Why did he even act antagonistic to him then? That’d be because he was intimidated by their canister.\n\nWhat he would’ve done is ask what was in the canister because he wouldn’t want it to be something lethal to people or make them sick, but again if he doesn’t actually care about the people of Capitol Hill, then it’d make sense that he wouldn’t care what’s in it. Maybe he just wanted to know where they were going with the canister, and wondered if they were going somewhere else than the White House, and because they were, he stopped caring.\n\nThere’s clearly only one thing they were up to carrying a canister, and that was that they planned on using the canister for something sinister. He could’ve easily stopped them. This scene shouldn’t have been in the story.\n\nTime passes and finally it’s lampshaded that Brain’s being rude by calling these guys his minions when he should be nicer to them for helping him. One says, “ I’ll give him faster in the kisser if he calls us minions again! “ Brain would’ve heard that, so he shouldn’t be stupid enough to call them minions again, after one of them plans on using a balloon that a kid left behind to make the canister lighter.\n\nBrain doesn’t think their idea’s so good, and one of the minions tells Brain to shut up and tells his friends to tie the balloon to the bottle. It was instantly obvious that the bottle would get floated up if it was tied to the bottle at worst, and none of the mice would be able to keep moving it forwards. The minions fly away holding the balloon and regret their decision as they thankfully leave the canister behind.\n\nI don’t think a mere balloon would be able to lift three mice away that high up. I don’t think a balloon would be able to lift even one mouse, considering how many balloons are needed to lift one little girl in Mythbusters.\n\nWe finally see the context behind that first image, because Brain’s laughing serum makes the ducks laugh and that proves it works. Pinky gets the impulse to pat him on the back to congratulate him. But in all of the plans he’s done with him, he’s never done that, so that’s Out of Character.\n\nAnd a pat on the back being inexplicably too hard and backfiring is so overdone that I’m sick of the cliché. It’s not like he’s that strong. How could he slap him that far away accidentally? It’d make more sense if he did it on purpose and just pretended to regret it, but that wouldn’t be in-character either.\n\nHe apologizes and asks if he’s okay, and Reality Ensues because he starts laughing from the serum. Brain says he forgot to make them immune to the serum. He’s almost as stupid as Eggman was with the Metal Virus! But I’d expect better from him, he was smart enough to try to leave Oz and try to take over somewhere else. That’d be like Eggman trying to leave Earth. He says he’s incapacitated, but that doesn’t justify Pinky carrying him home.\n\nThis story by Dave King’s about Brain trying to take over the world by trying to put laughing serum in Washington D.C.’s water supply. For SOME reason he hires minions from a talking mice restaurant on Earth to do it, when he could’ve been much more likely to succeed if he just flew in a tiny helicopter with the serum in it, so he’d get to his destination just fine. Instead he does something that takes a lot longer.\n\nThe minions end up flying away with a balloon when they try to make their job get done faster. And Pinky uncharacteristically hits him on the back, and knocks him into the pond full of laughing serum, and THAT foils their plan. As usual it’s all full of problems that could’ve easily not happened.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 11:\n\nBrain tells Pinky he doesn’t have a plan to take over the world tonight, and Pinky says that’s alright, before being confused. Brain says what he’s planned for tonight is only stage one of his newly modified modus operandi that he thinks could eventually lead to him taking over the world.\n\nWhy can’t he get a take over the world plan on the same night AFTER that? I thought the story was gonna stand out because it’d be about something else. He wouldn’t have talked like this then.\n\nBrain shows Pinky an invention resembling a blow dryer and says he’s got a ray gun that can duplicate anyone or anything he wants. So he could ruin the economic value of anything if he used it on it enough times, and create a whole new person who could easily take over someone’s life. That’s pretty dangerous.\n\nBut it’s also overpowered, making all of his money-making schemes stupid when he could just use this instead. Brain wastes his time asking if any of his plans ever worked when he knows the answer, and Pinky has a stupid response to why they never succeeded.\n\nBrain says his plans always fail because of Pinky. So he plans on cloning himself to have a new partner, an unusually smart plan. This must be a different universe from the episode of the show where he learned that he NEEDS to have a partner like Pinky and couldn’t stand to have another smart partner.\n\nIf his partner was him, he’d make the same stupid plans and wouldn’t see what’s wrong with them, so the plans would often be doomed to fail anyways, but still, a lot of his plans weren’t fundamentally flawed and did only fail because of Pinky, so this is Genre Savvy, except it’s obvious to us that he would miss Pinky and give up on this because he won’t just erase his memory of him.\n\nHe tells Pinky their association’s come to an end, yeah right, and he says he wishes it didn’t have to end like this. When Pinky starts crying and walks away, we see Brain look sad, which thankfully humanizes him after he did something so unlike him. Brain duplicates himself and his clone congratulates him.\n\nThen he complains that his duplication ray’s worked so perfectly that his clone is identical to him and some other person couldn’t tell them apart. He should’ve thought of this earlier. The clone says that if one of them were to leave the room, how would the other determine which of them left? Why did he say something so stupid? That’s something Pinky would say.\n\nOf course the one still in the room would know that the other one left because HE’S still there. And surprisingly it’s NOT that the clones are stupider than HE is, which makes sense, but doesn’t explain THIS.\n\nBrain stamps him with a stamp that’s conveniently there to put a 2 on his forehead. If he didn’t anticipate this problem, why did he already have that stamp? He just wanted to humiliate Pinky with it? The clone gets mad at being relegated to a number 2 position, which Brain should’ve expected. It’s almost as if it’s common sense that he needs a partner who’s been brainwashed to be loyal to him, and he was just lucky Pinky didn’t need that.\n\nBrain reminds the clone that he created him and so he feels entitled to being his master. The clone would understand that right away, he’s him so he would’ve anticipated this, not been surprised.\n\nThe clone runs away with the duplication ray and leaves the lab, getting Brain hurt. Brain says he really hates himself right now and can’t let himself run amok. Brain wonders what he would do in his position. Couldn’t he let him take over the world? Then he could replace him, and easily become the world ruler. Rather than the clone running off to get Pinky’s help because obviously his previous situation proved to him that he can’t work with another him, the clone duplicated himself.\n\nBrain lampshades that he should’ve known better, so it’s a good thing the story’s interesting enough to be worth the fact that it’s completely forced, as if he’s a genius, he’d have known he needs loyalty for a partner. He’s just so used to Pinky’s loyalty that he took it for granted. Go figure, he gets worried that the clone’s clone did the same thing, and he did, as he finds him in an old warehouse. This could result in the world being full of Brains. It reminds me of the episode of Rick and Morty with the decoys.\n\nBrain complains later on that he cast Pinky out into the cold, and he’s so lucky he found Pinky again. He tells Pinky he made a horrible mistake and needs him back. That’s satisfying to see, and what’s even better is that Pinky’s being Out of Character and says, “ Gee, I dunno, Brain, “ and tells him that he hurt his feelings. I’d expect him to just happily accept right away.\n\nInstead he plays it smart from his perspective and says he’ll only come back if he promises not to take him for granted anymore and never throw him out again. I say “ from his perspective “ because a promise isn’t a guarantee.\n\nBrain tells him not to push it with his dessert condition, and Pinky acts like he didn’t hear that, but he does pick him up and hug him, so it’s too bad he’s startled by it as usual, as if he hugged him too tightly. He could’ve appreciated it and made it a lot better.\n\nThe only reason Pinky wouldn’t know where all of those clones came from is if he forgot about the ray Brain JUST showed him tonight, which only makes sense because that episode from his perspective showed that he’s got long trains of thought unrelated to reality, which cause him to forget things, but it’s still a stretch because it’s so recent. He saw something unusual happen, of COURSE it’s because of Brain’s inventions.\n\nBrain wonders where he’s ever going to find himself now. Pinky asks him where he’d go if he wanted to take over the world. The White House. They could have a better chance of taking it over because they’re all together as a group. No, Brain says the lab. That’d be my second choice.\n\nHe had a good reason to wonder where the clones went because he goes to a different place to try to take over the world every night, and why did the clones even bother going back to the lab when they should’ve known that it’d be crowded with other Brains who’d make it impossible for them to take advantage of the place?\n\nThey came back because they had no choice but to check in case it was unoccupied if they wanted its technology and materials and the lab was the easiest place to get them, and they were all overconfident that they could overcome any other Brains, overconfident indeed considering there’d be an entire army of them. He should’ve known to go to the lab again on his own. Brain calls Pinky a genius.\n\nWhy didn’t he see the other Brains in his lab immediately? Instead he has to wait a few seconds. He tells the clones to pledge loyalty to him when that didn’t work the first time because he’s desperate, and of course the clones want to be the master instead and want Pinky as an assistant. I knew it, Pinky loves that they’re fighting over him. He says, “ Oh, Brain, it’s so NICE to be wanted again! “ He sees the Brains miraculously climb the table even though there’d be nothing for them to actually grab onto while doing so.\n\nBrain tells Pinky to aim the ray at his duplicates and fire when he says now. This gets rid of the sentient beings, with them being perfectly fine with their first act of murder for some reason, and the beam reflects off a shiny surface on the microscope back at the ray gun. This destroys it for no reason, overloading it. Brain says that for no reason, it couldn’t withstand over a thousand uses in a single evening. So at least it has SOME limit when it comes to ruining the value of an object. Brain says he’ll fix it.\n\nAnd it turns out there’s tons of Pinkys now. That’ll freak out the lab workers. You’d think if he’s too attached to Pinky to kill him, he’d have to tell Pinky to do that to the clones of Pinky, who would know what they’re planning ahead of time and they’d all scatter and run away in different directions. So he’d never be able to get rid of all of them. Also how could he fix the ray gun before the lab workers would come in the next day and remove the other Pinkys?\n\nThis story by Bobbi Weiss is about Brain making a duplication ray but somehow not duplicating a valuable object to get rich, but instead duplicating himself, because he’s tired of Pinky ruining his plans. I love that he gets the idea that he does that all the time himself, because he’s supposed to be a genius, so he would know that, he wouldn’t need a machine to figure that out like in the show.\n\nBut while he had a Genre Savvy idea, he should’ve known that if he was the clone, he’d want to be the one in charge because he always does, so it was common sense for him to have brainwashing prepared for his new partner ahead of time.\n\nWhat’s even harder to believe is that every single clone also duplicates himself, even though he should know from experience that it wouldn’t work out, because he refused to work for his master too. The story ends with Brain getting rid of the other Brains because they all ran at him. He’s got no proof that that’s ALL of them.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 12:\n\nAfter time traveling to 1962, and humoring Pinky on his idea to get new hairdoes to match, Brain says that his daily thoughts have finally borne fruit, and while it was way more likely to be a figure of speech, I don’t blame Pinky for asking for an apple then, because Brain can do anything, and his plans are silly and random, so he could’ve actually borne fruit.\n\nBrain says that in two days, some of the planets will orbit past Earth leaving a straight path towards the sun, so he plans on building a giant rubber slingshot around the Earth and threatening to shoot it into the Sun if he’s not given leadership of the world, so he’d never be able to do this because he’d never get access to that much rubber, as obviously he’d need more rubber than the entire mass of the Earth.\n\nPinky thinks the only problem is who’ll aim the slingshot. Isn’t it obvious he could make a robot to do that, a giant robot? Though again he might need more iron for it than the entire mass of the Earth considering how big the slingshot would be. But if he goes to other planets for iron, he could get all that iron. Brain says it’s somehow well-known that the Earth’s entire rubber supply has been diverted to make go-go boots. It wouldn’t be the entire supply.\n\nBrain wonders how to get it and Pinky talks about the TV showing off those very boots, telling him to look at them dance. So Brain plans on throwing a party to lure people to him to steal their rubber boots. I guess it’ll go with the idea that people are so desperate for parties, they’ll have them anywhere and with anyone, no matter how unpopular, which is why that girl in Malcolm in the Middle had people come to her party when she was told no one would.\n\nPinky says they could simply steal their boots when they’re sleeping, but overthinks things and assumes that if they ate too much at the party their feet would be too fat for the boots to come off, even though clearly their feet wouldn’t expand THAT fast. Brain says that the friction of the dancing boots on the floor will cause static electricity, and he says this will trigger his machine, oh, but Pinky’s gonna power it by pedaling this generator.\n\nThat’s disappointing because in real life, people HAVE invented a way for the dancing in clubs to power generators, so he could’ve done that instead of trusting Pinky. He says the machine will suck the boots off their feet as they dance. And they’d see that and immediately freak out and try to get them back on, and these two little mice wouldn’t be able to get them, especially considering how big the boots are compared to them.\n\nHe’s better off going with Pinky’s plan, unless the boots are gonna be sucked to a place where nobody but Brain could retrieve them. It cuts ahead and it turns out Brain rented a hall instead of trying to throw the party in the lab. I guess he assumed the lab workers would see and stop the party. He also spent the money to hire a band, so at least he gave people money to try to make up for this plan. Of course it’s pretty easy to figure out how he could’ve had the money; either a past scheme or someone else’s money.\n\nBrain hopes the band plays soft hits or their machine might overload. Why did he ever trust a machine that could be made to overload so easily? All this dialogue did was seem to completely give away how the plan’s gonna fail in an unsatisfying way that could’ve easily not happened and came out of nowhere. Now I wish it skipped to the end because every page after this is a waste of my time.\n\nThe Beatles show up, and then a whole bunch of panels are wasted with extreme boredom with the Beatles talking to Brain. I hate the lyric quoting. Why does he even waste time telling them his plan to take over the world? And they don’t care, which makes sense because he’s a little mouse and always fails anyways. Not to mention it’s common sense to be nice to him just in case he succeeds.\n\nAfter boring padding the people say the floor’s too sticky for them to dance because there’s too much rubber in the room. At least that means the plan’s failing for a different reason than I expected, but still, I’d never expect this to be possible either. It makes no sense if he’s able to make this machine in the first place. It’s immediately obvious that him telling Pinky to pedal faster will only delay the inevitable, so the story’s boring until finally Pinky’s unable to keep pedaling.\n\nThe people in the dance decide to leave because they think the concert’s over and an explosion happens. And Brain’s dialogue in the last few panels is just stilted. I assume they’re quoting lyrics, but they wouldn’t do that. It should’ve ended here because nothing matters after this point.\n\nThis story was by Dana Kurtin. This was about Brain having a stupid plan that he shouldn’t have thought he could get enough rubber for, and he tries to get some rubber for it, requiring that he use a static electricity machine to try to suck the rubber boots off dancers at a party, but it fails because somehow there can be too much rubber for the machine to not explode from, and he somehow had it powered by Pinky pedaling when he could’ve had it powered by the dancing itself easily.\n\nAlthough he could’ve had enough rubber for his plan, if he actually does have a way to travel to other universes. ‘Cause if he can travel to the land of Oz he could get enough resources to make his plan possible. But of course that would still take forever.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 16:\n\nAfter redundant panels, eventually Brain tells Pinky that he somehow reprogrammed a mere wristwatch calculator to send funds from anywhere to his Swiss bank account, and he says everyone has one, which would only make sense if he didn’t mean that and was just trying to be smug. Is it realistic that a non-citizen non-person has a bank account? He’s a lab mouse. Does he have a fake identity? This trope is unrealistic.\n\nAt least he only plans on transferring two dollars from every account each. He says he’ll beam the calculations from the watch to a satellite to get global coverage, but he’s lacking a powerful enough laser to project the beam, even though he could make anything. I guess he doesn’t have the resources for it or doesn’t know how to make it.\n\nNaturally Pinky ignores him to watch TV, where there’s a very boring commercial for a monster truck rally that advertises a tractor projecting a laser light, the largest laser in the world. I like that it says the money buys you your seat, but you’ll only need the edge. Brain asks if he’s thinking what he’s thinking and at least he finally wonders why he even bothers. I dunno maybe he’s curious about what Pinky’s gonna say next?\n\nHe wants to win the monster truck competition and try to steal the laser when he’s in the winner’s circle. Pinky says that won’t work because they don’t have a monster truck when it’s obvious his plan was to make one or get one. Brain says he’s gonna fix up the truck outside.\n\nBrain tells Pinky not to call him Tim, which must be a pop culture reference. Brain wants a crowbar to lift the truck, and Pinky calls him Tim again like he doesn’t care and apologizes, and says there’s nothing looking like a bird in his bag, when crowbar sounds nothing like bird. Somehow Brain tells Pinky that something a book recommended is just an unnecessary safety precaution, and he gets crushed by the truck because of it.\n\nThey get the truck working, and Brain says he’ll steer, but it still looks like he wouldn’t be high up enough to see what’s in the front window. So how was he that dumb? He tells Pinky to jump on certain pedals in response to go and stop, and then tells him to go slower and gets apologized to.\n\nBrain says nothing will stop him when he could’ve easily not bragged that his plan was gonna succeed, so Pinky hears the word stop and causes him to slam into the front window, which could’ve easily not happened if Brain put on a small seat-belt. How did he not think to do this? Pinky would know he doesn’t want him to hit the brakes right now because he’d have nothing to gain from it. So this whole scene would only make sense if he was intentionally doing this to spite him for good reason.\n\nBrain even threatens to hurt him, so no wonder he keeps suffering. Despite their names not being listed in the monster truck rally, they’re still allowed to go in, with the guy acting as if he didn’t believe them, even though it’s obvious just from looking at them that they really are what Brain says they are. Pinky likes that they’re selling food he likes to eat. I wonder if this is foreshadowing how he’ll ruin his plan, because these stories do that a lot with something seemingly unimportant regarding him.\n\nIt turns out Pinky did get some caramel corn, and Brain has his hands behind his back and doesn’t want to shake a person’s hand, but that makes sense because the guy has an evil smirk and clearly hurt the other racer’s hand. Brain refuses with a lame excuse because he’s too scared to stand up to him. Pinky gets gum on his hand and thankfully gets away with it.\n\nThey get back into the truck, and Brain freaks out at seeing the food mentioned earlier in his truck, covering the calculator. The bad guy from earlier says he helps the other drivers with a tune-up but laughs like he can’t be trusted, and when he sees Brain drying Pinky with wipes, he says he can see he’s got enough problems already. So this alone changed his mind about wrecking their engine somehow. This is sweet of Brain, because Pinky could dry himself with wipes. Instead he’s doing it for him like he’s his kid.\n\nThe truck rally starts, Brain warns Pinky that their truck is going too fast, and Pinky says the pedal is stuck because of the cotton candy. He thought to DRY Pinky with WIPES, but he didn’t get everything out of the truck? I guess he didn’t notice the pedal or have the time. If only Brain thought to tell Pinky he’s not allowed to get anything to eat until after he’d win the race. It was obvious that caramel could backfire on him. The vehicle ends up upside-down on a pole.\n\nThere’s a lot of pointless panels. The two vehicles remaining get pitted against each other in a race to the top of the hill made of cars. The bad guy pops Brain’s tire and he tells Pinky to find an air hose to refill them while he’ll start the engine. He finds a hose near some balloons, and their truck has an easy time getting up the car hill and is basically floating because of the helium in the balloons. I have a feeling this is unrealistic. It was only a few little balloons’ worth of helium.\n\nThe truck ends up on top of the car hill as the bad guy’s truck ends up crashing headfirst. You’d think the truck would be accused of cheating because of its floating and be disqualified. Brain and Pinky jump out of the truck and Brain says that over time, the helium will dissipate, so go figure, it crashes onto Brain and ruins his calculator. He magically survived this because he and Pinky can always heal really fast.\n\nThis story by Jesse Leon McCann is about Brain wanting to get access to a powerful laser from the winner’s circle of a monster truck rally for a money-stealing plan, that at least was gonna only steal a minor amount from each account. You’d think since he can make any invention for the plots, as if resources aren’t a problem, he’d be able to make the world’s largest laser himself.\n\nInstead he relies on Pinky to use the pedals of his monster truck. At least it was surprising because what ruins his plan isn’t the fact that Pinky got food from the rally all over the truck. Pinky’s why they got as far as they did.\n\nBut when the bad guy lets air loose from one of their tires, Pinky gets told to get an air hose to fill it up, with no mention of the fact that they have to block the hole in the tire, and he uses a hose near some balloons that are there for some reason and the helium causes the truck to float. This probably doesn’t make sense because the combined mass of the balloons don’t add up to the mass of the truck. And of course the truck lands on Brain’s calculator.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 19:\n\nIt’s nice of Brain to tell Pinky he can watch TV first before helping him in his next plan. He watches a news report about a spree of cheese abductions, and somehow the most supported theory about them is that aliens did it… Apparently in this universe, everyone knows aliens exist because they tend to go to Earth. Pinky says it’s a lot of rubbish because he doesn’t know what aliens would do with cheese, which would only make sense if he assumes aliens would hate cheese from having different biology.\n\nBrain wonders if the aliens don’t want cheese, and says randomly that a lot of groups look for their prophecized leader. Someone gives them cheese and jokes that the aliens might take the two of them. Brain says he’s concluded that he’s an alien, even though he remembers his backstory. But if he was made with the help of alien DNA, that would help explain how he became the way he did.\n\nHe says he’s always doubted the ability of the scientists around him to actually achieve gene splicing the way they do. So did I, because it was just the 90s. So as unlikely as it’d be for them to find alien anything, it’d be more believable than his actual backstory.\n\nBrain assumes he’s the prophesied leader of aliens looking for him, even though he’s got no proof that he’s actually their leader. If they were looking for him, they’re more likely looking for him because he’s so smart. It’d explain them stealing cheese. They’re doing it for a mouse, and he even says this. But they could also be mice aliens, because we saw cat aliens want mice earlier.\n\nPinky says they could’ve just placed an ad in the personal columns. That’s a good point! Why didn’t they do that? That’d be less effort, so that just makes the story less believable. Pinky says all this talk sounds stupid and wonders how they could find the aliens. Brain plans on visiting the last abduction site. Why is he even gonna bother with disguises? They’re always paper thin, and yet they still work, and it must be because people would rather humor them than waste time provoking them.\n\nAlso he’s being completely desperate if he thinks they’ll go to the latest abduction site because they already went there. He’s not trying to predict where they’ll go next because that’s impossible.\n\nThe guy driving a bus even asks them what they’re supposed to be. Brain lies that they’re disguised as mice. It makes sense that he wonders if they’re kidding. No disguise would decrease someone’s height that much. Brain tells him the truth, so I like that he gets nervous and takes longer to ask if they want tickets. He lets them go on the bus anyways out of fear. Pinky annoys Brain and almost calls him an idiot for a change.\n\nAnd eventually after padding, someone falls in front of them and apologizes and says he was doing bird-watching even though it’s night. He does have binoculars though. Brain tells Pinky to follow him as he assumes he knows something. And somehow they see Elvis and don’t recognize him, which would only make sense if these versions of Pinky and Brain are from a universe without him being famous, or where he actually disappeared. Anyways Pinky offers Brain some cheese and gets thanked for it.\n\nEventually Brain figures out because the cheese is only available in one town that they have to go there. You’d think it’d make sense that a mouse would have done extensive research on cheese, but no, he’s an engineer who’s obsessed with taking over the world. He’s lucky he knows this, because learning about cheese would be a diversion, of course.\n\nHe has Pinky pretend to be pregnant, and when someone stops their car for him, he agrees to take them far away to their destination because of their ruse. And he wisely humors Brain when he tells him that when he’s the world leader, he’ll see that he’s treated with leniency. Pinky sees a sign saying that Wisconsin is the other way, and Brain tells him not now when he tries to warn him, and threatens him when he says this is really important, so that’s dumb, but to be fair Pinky was annoying him with irrelevant dialogue all story.\n\nPinky apologizes and speaks stupidly and carries him as he jumps out of the car with him, and they somehow tore their clothes after the fall. Pinky tells him that the guy was taking them in the wrong direction. This would make sense if he was intentionally doing this to them. After all Brain made it clear that he wants to take over the world and he did pick them up in the car too easily for an 800 mile trip.\n\nBrain says that he feels obligated to point out that they now have to walk 200 miles with every bone broken, but the next panel has them fine, so they healed fast as usual. So he was being melodramatic when he said that because he’d know they’d only have that problem for a couple of seconds. But it is a pretty amusing panel.\n\nThey walk to the cheese factory and Brain wonders why the government would be hoarding cheese in an abandoned cheese factory. There’s some lights above them, but Brain tells them not to go and tells Pinky to take off his clothes. Pinky says that’d be embarrassing since he’s used to wearing clothes already.\n\nHe says these disguises made them think they were enemies, when the disguises were paper-thin anyways. We see someone using binoculars say to wait until they’re gone before turning the lights back on. Someone beside him says, “ Another night, another coup averted. “\n\nAnd apparently it’s necessary to get the proper info. This would only make sense if these two actually knew about Brain and assumed he was going to steal the cheese to take over the world, and a lot of his plans don’t seem like they’d let him do that in step one, so why not assume that, when he literally told two people in the story that he wants to be the world leader?\n\nBut him saying, “ Another night, another coup averted, “ implies that he’s been doing this EVERY day. So this has to be another universe because usually they don’t stop his plan. The story ends with Brain saying he’s learning about the paranormal from videos he found in the lab, and Pinky says that stuff on TV Isn’t real. Their roles are reversed for some reason.\n\nThen Pinky has his finger on his head, and the cheese starts swirling around above him, because apparently the way he was genetically engineered gave him this ability, and he just never tried to use it before. But he’s quirky enough to try. Brain doesn’t see because he’s not looking at him and doesn’t respect him enough to look.\n\nHe could easily prove to Brain that he could do that, and that’d impress him, but maybe it’s only restricted to very small things and thus useless to his plans anyways, so it’d make sense that he wouldn’t tell Brain this because it’d just waste their time. And Pinky even looks tired after the cheese falls, sighing and sweating about it. So the only reason this would happen is that he’d always be very weak at telekinesis anyways.\n\nThis story by Dave King is about Brain assuming because of a news report that aliens are looking for him to be their leader and trying to lure him with the cheese they’ve been stealing, since people look for the new Dalai Lama, and he decides to go on a trip to try to get to the site of a cheese abduction in the hopes that he’d see the aliens again. It was really stupid of him because there’s no reason the aliens would revisit a place.\n\nThe lights were just made by humans to scare him away and foil his plan on purpose. So THAT was interesting. Before that, someone tried to drive him AWAY from his destination and Pinky saved him from the car. It makes sense that eventually someone would try to stop him from taking over the world. As for what took so long… different universe.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 22:\n\nBrain tells Pinky to behold the fruits of his labor, and I don’t blame Pinky for taking him literally because he’s young and Brain’s capable of making anything, so for all he knows this IS a fruit. Brain presses a button and makes it bounce dangerously around the cage begging to hurt them. Brain says this is a tiny prototype of his new idea, an atomic superball.\n\nHe says that a superball remote-controlled from Mount Everest would bring Earth’s populace to its knees. The smaller ball literally does that to Pinky. So, Brain wants to try to intimidate his way into becoming the leader, with something he could only send at a few people at a time.\n\nHe says that the only material he lacks to make his superball, is a deep-fat fryer, and he knows which one because he read the FDA’s latest report that this fat hasn’t been changed in 10 years and is at a dangerous level of erratic plasticity. How could it get away with that for so long? It’s nice of Brain to put his hand on Pinky’s shoulder.\n\nPinky acts sweet and we see them wearing tiny uniforms Brain must have made. Brain says the FDA task force for the handling of hazardous substances will supervise the emptying of that fryer today, and only a person of high rank could be given that job. And he just assumes that with his intellect, he’ll be promoted to manager, but that’s not very likely to happen, especially since he has no education or work experience to put on a resume.\n\nSo he’ll be lucky to even get hired. I’ve heard of McDonalds not hiring people unless they’ve got a college degree, so would this made-up restaurant be unusually stuck up too? Pinky wonders why they shouldn’t just pretend to be FDA agents instead. Brain says they should never pose as a US official because it always catches up with you. And he doesn’t think anything else will? Last story he pretended to be an FBI agent!\n\nBrain tells the manager that they want some jobs there, and accuses him of discriminating against them for their height. I guess the manager’s scared of being sued because he decides to lie about it and hires them, even though he’d have a very good reason to not hire people way too short to do the job well. I guess his logic is that he thinks they’ll do so badly that he’ll get to fire them pretty soon anyways, so it doesn’t matter if he humors them.\n\nHe warns someone to show Brain the ropes carefully, and pauses before saying carefully, implying that he doesn’t trust him. And why would he? Not only is he too small for this but with the trouble these two cause, they’d be lucky if someone in their city didn’t recognize them. The manager tells an employee that Brain’s challenged while he’s smirking, and he says he’ll go slow.\n\nSo he has a vendetta against him. It makes sense that he’d think he’s way dumber than he seems because he’s trying to get a job he’s way too small for, so he didn’t think this through.\n\nBrain’s told to make 500 burgers. He says “ I beg your pardon, “ because of the sheer amount, and the employee acts condescending and decides to speak really slow so he’d have a better chance of understanding, and he shows him how to make a burger, but he doesn’t show him exactly how to fry up patties right, so he only showed him the part that anyone would know how to do.\n\nBrain easily makes a bunch of burgers, but somehow the employee decides to stop him, by outright spraying him with mustard, and tells him to put lettuce on first and then tomato. So he definitely has a vendetta against him. Brain naturally gets mad at him for bullying him, and tells Pinky that he’s gotten demoted for telling Al where to put his buns. I wish we saw what he said to him, because that would’ve been a little cathartic.\n\nBrain says only utter nitwits can prosper at this establishment, which could only make sense if it’s because someone smart like him would think he deserves better and be too unsatisfied at the job to stand it and do amazingly for long enough to get promoted. Pinky’s been promoted to his supervisor, which would only make sense if it was done to spite Brain and reward Pinky for being so good-natured, considering that the way he talks makes him look unreliable sometimes.\n\nHe says he’s here to help, and somehow Brain thinks that talking with overly big words to a customer is a good idea. So while he makes it obvious that he has an advanced vocabulary to her, I can’t fully blame her for thinking that he’s just learning English because someone actually good at speaking English would just speak in a way that’s understandable, while he’s ignoring common sense like a moron.\n\nSo of course he’s gonna get treated like one. A part of being good at a language is knowing which words are common and which aren’t. She orders slowly, and another customer acts pathetic in front of Brain complaining that he gets no appreciation from him.\n\nPinky smartly advises him to smile and he does so. A customer wonders if he’s grinning because he’s mocking his choice of meal, which makes sense because Brain’s smile looks too silly to just be a normal smile about something normal, and the guy in a bad mood ordered what’s based on a Happy Meal. Brain somehow assumed that the help wanted sign had been out for 10 years straight.\n\nHe ends up demoted again. The boss took this as an excuse to do that even though it obviously wasn’t his fault that he had a customer with a temper problem, and it was only one. But this could still make sense because the manager never actually wanted to hire them, so he’s jumping at the excuse to mistreat him. And fortunately it’s explained better because Pinky says Brain cursed at the manager.\n\nBrain says Uranus isn’t a swear word. But why would he have said that? No wonder he thought he was saying that, to try to curse without cursing. Brain says that to get promoted, he has to lie and be overly friendly. So he imitates Pinky by saying it’s fun when he’s told to never leave the lids on the Happy Meal up. Then he’s told some other instructions in the same slow condescending way because the manager hates him.\n\nHe’s given a really obvious instruction and then told to always put the mop back in the closet when he’s done, which only makes sense because he’d want to always know where it is. Brain gets promoted as a reward for acting cheerful. Pinky says they’re real Daburger material and it’s nice of Brain to say he’s glad Pinky considers that to be a compliment.\n\nThen he says it’s time to empty the fryer. He’s shocked that Al’s going to be told to empty it instead, and the manager says the stench of that grease alone could kill a man, so he’d never risk his life when he was acting so cheerful. It’d make more sense if he was doing this specifically to spite Brain since Brain’s dialogue made it clear that he planned on emptying the fryer. Also he must be exaggerating when he says it could kill a man, because obviously it’d be illegal to send him to do this, then.\n\nBrain gets the smart idea to beg Pinky to demote him, and he tries to do things to get demoted. He says the Happy Meal container isn’t properly fastened, and explains that it allows outside contaminants to get in, which finally explains why that was a rule. He says the fridge door has been left open, risking the food spoiling, and he tries to ruin the sauce, but Pinky says he doesn’t care because he was already shown what makes it special.\n\nThe only reason it’d make sense that he doesn’t just demote him already, to humor his friend, is that he’s getting back at Brain, and when he finally does demote him for leaving the mop out, it’s because he thinks he can’t get away with putting off demoting him any longer.\n\nPinky warns him to put the mop away because someone could trip and fall, and Al trips with the fryer, which completely ruins his plan, sending an orb of fat chasing after him. Pinky says Brain destroyed the restaurant, and at least shows off that he got a paycheck from it. Brain wisely suggests buying him earplugs. And in the last panel, Pinky has pink eyes instead of blue for no reason.\n\nThis story was by Dana Kurtin and had Brain try to get fat from a fryer that was somehow left alone for 10 years. It was interesting to see what it’d be like if Pinky and Brain worked at a place like McDonalds. I’m glad it’s explained right away why the manager would have a vendetta against Brain, and why he even hired people so short, because he only hired them after he was threatened into it with a discrimination lawsuit, and Brain insults people offscreen to justify getting demoted.\n\nHis plan was built on the assumption that only a high-ranking person would be given the job of disposing of a dangerous deep-fat fryer, but instead the job is given to someone else because he got promoted and they don’t want to risk his life. But it’d make more sense if the real reason was that he just said he plans on emptying the deep fryer, so the manager would want to keep him from getting to do that.\n\nHe wouldn’t suddenly like him just because he started acting cheerful to get promoted, because he wouldn’t have forgotten everything else he did before that. And there’s no clear explanation for why Pinky as his supervisor didn’t demote him, as soon as he wanted him to. If he had done that, Brain wouldn’t have left the mop out and caused Al to trip with the fryer and ruin his plan.\n\nI have to assume that Pinky didn’t fire him right away because he knew that was what Brain wanted, and he would rather get back at him, but thought he couldn’t get away with keeping that up after Brain said he left him no choice.\n\nBut without an explanation that Pinky did something we’re not supposed to think is in-character for him, there’s no real excuse for him causing Brain to ruin his plan, because obviously he could’ve gotten away with demoting him for no reason because nobody was watching him, and he could’ve come up with a lie about why he demoted him.\n\nCome to think of it since Brain can make a time machine, he could’ve gotten that fat by having a hidden deep-fat fryer in the lab have fat 10 years in the past and then returning to it in the present.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 24:\n\nIt starts out with Brain and Pinky in a past time period leaving a cage. Brain plans to sell inflatable bustles to women for their skirts to be more robust. Pinky asks if that’s where the bust was, and Brain says that because he’s a gentleman, he’ll ignore what he said.\n\nBrain says his signal will make the bustles inflate rendering them airborne, and he somehow assumes that with no one left to cook or clean, the world’s men will have no choice but to surrender to him, to get them back I guess, even though there’d be nothing stopping them from going back on saying they surrender as soon as he’d get them their women back and become vulnerable.\n\nThen Brain says he lacks the money to refine the prototype and needs to raise the money. So, him saying this plan looks like it was a waste of time if it’s just gonna be another plan to raise money that won’t even get that done.\n\nWe see the Brooklyn Bridge and Brain says that whoever controls it would make a fortune in tolls, so he plans to claim that he’s the son of the bridge’s engineer and take over the job. Why does he think that’ll work? He’s clearly a talking mouse, so nobody would believe he was actually related to him or even his adopted son, and he’s got no education and work experience.\n\nSomehow Pinky asks a genius engineer if he knows anything about construction. Somehow Brain doesn’t say yes and instead insists that no engineer does and just hopes for the best. Pinky naturally doesn’t understand when he says he needs to find the foreman and says he sees 8 men, and Brain assumes based on how he looks that he’s the right guy to talk to.\n\nHe expects them to believe he’s the son of their late engineer with no evidence and when he demands respect, Pinky uncharacteristically complains that he’s giving him the chills. The actual son tells off Brain and doubts that he’s an engineer. He tells Pinky to bring him donuts to eat instead of actual tools and materials. Why is this joke being made?\n\nHe says he wants the bridge plans, and somehow BRAIN says he can’t read them and that makes them call him an engineer. I don’t get it. Was the writer rejected as an engineer and got bitter? This doesn’t make any sense. He gets challenged to a competition of construction.\n\nThey’re expected to go through trials, including one to see who can dig most efficiently in a pressurized air compartment at the bridge’s base, and the first man to hit bedrock wins. Brain says he’ll use a muscular enhancement device, which is just metal arms connected to his wrists, and Pinky complains that it’s cheating. Brain’s a mouse, he’s got to make up for his worse strength to make the contest fair.\n\nHe tells Pinky to turn the knob gently to the left and somehow it’s turned the wrong way. That’d only make sense if he did this to punish him for cheating. Brain ends up digging a deep hole and somehow someone says that he’s beginning to suspect he’s not a human, when he’d have known that already. Pinky thanks Brain for getting him Chinese food. So he was actually smart to ask him for some.\n\nIt turns out Brain dug the foundation out from under the bridge. You’d think this would’ve disqualified him from the competition right there. Then their next trial is to make suggestive comments to women because construction workers are stereotyped for that, even though I thought that was just a modern stereotype, not an old-time one.\n\nThe one who embarrasses the most women is going to win. Brain refuses to do this, and says he respects women. He demands the men to apologize to them and surprisingly shames them into doing so. One of the men apologizes to his mother, as Brain fails another trial, and says that engineers have never spoken to women even though they’d have mothers and teachers. Why is the writer so jealous of engineers that he’s making things up to mock them? Most people don’t make all of those jokes.\n\nFor the final event, Brain’s job is to bind tons of wires into a cable, and the first one across the bridge wins, and Pinky is Brain’s partner, which Brain was smart to not want. I assume he couldn’t just ask for a new partner. Pinky spins the binding wheel too fast with the strength enhancer. I don’t blame him for thinking this wouldn’t backfire and would only get the job done a lot faster. They get sent ahead and a platform slams into something and they end up being flung off it.\n\nThe foreman says that while Brain’s won every round, he also practically destroyed the bridge in the process. Why did he say Brain won every round when he refused to participate in the second trial? He can’t tell what person to pick, and somehow he decides to use the real son’s mother to try to solve this dispute. The mother looks at both of them, and the only reason it’d make sense that she says she can’t tell them apart is that she’s just messing with them.\n\nShe says she has to see the tushie she diapered when her boy was a kid. There’s no way that would be the one way she’d identify her son. Obviously she wouldn’t be able to see it looking the same way again. Even if she had face blindness and color blindness she still would be able to see that the overall shape of her real son in general is definitely that of her real son, since I doubt it’s been decades since she’s seen him, and Brain looks nothing like a human.\n\nBrain tells Pinky that by sheer luck indeed, he’s somehow wearing his bustle prototype under his suit. He wouldn’t do that because he’d know it’d risk it getting destroyed from all the slapstick he always goes through on his adventures, and it was meant for women to wear instead. So how’d he even get this idea? He tells Pinky to inflate it. The people near them would hear this, and Brain would know that. They’d also hear Brain tell Pinky to stop. She’d see the wire.\n\nPinky says he can’t stop because there’s no off switch. Brain would’ve remembered that because he made it. Brain ends up floating away, and the only reason it’d make sense that the woman calls him her son is that she’s just messing with people. The whole story I was waiting for the scam about the Brooklyn Bridge to be mentioned, and finally Pinky tells Brain that as a present he bought him the bridge, with all of their savings.\n\nBut unfortunately, we don’t get to see a panel where he explains to Pinky why that’s a stupid idea. He doesn’t explain that you can’t own the bridge since bridges are government property, so that doesn’t help educate people to not fall for a scam like that, which sucks because making stories about scams could run the risk of causing a person to try said scams on people who didn’t get educated not to fall for them.\n\nThis story by Dana Kurtin was about Brain trying to get the job of the Brooklyn Bridge engineer by claiming to be his son, a flawed plan to begin with of course, and when the real son reveals that he was right there, the two of them get entered in a construction worker competition with each other to determine who would get the job. You’d think Brain would’ve been expected to hand in a resume instead and get rejected.\n\nBrain compensates for his weaker strength using a digging machine, and refuses to cat-call but he’s somehow counted as winning that trial too, and then Pinky makes the binding wheel for the bridge wires spin too fast with his machine.\n\nSomehow despite winning all of the trials, he’s not given the job right away, and instead the real son’s mother says she can’t tell who’s her real son, which would only make sense if she was lying and just joking because she’s not a good person, or her son just sucks that much.\n\nShe somehow says the only way she could tell which one is her real son is to check his tushie even though obviously he’s grown a lot since he was a baby, and when Pinky inflates Brain’s pants with a machine he had no reason to think to wear under them, Brain flies away because there was no off switch on it. So that ending could’ve easily not happened.\n\nI was glad the plot wasn’t about Brain trying to sell someone the Brooklyn Bridge because that’d be lazy. I hate all of the stupid confusing jokes against engineers for no reason, which showed no gratitude for making most of the things we love and take for granted. So I’d never expect them to be made fun of. How does Brain have no respect for engineers when he’s one?\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 28:\n\nBrain wonders what Pinky’s watching. Since when would he care? That must be because of the way Spock looks getting his curiosity. He says Pinky’s been in front of the TV all day. I thought they got experimented on every day. They were lucky to get a break. Brain sarcastically calls Star Trek the finer arts and changes the channel because he already knows about a new advancement in cloning. That’d only make sense if he heard about it from lab workers here first.\n\nHe sees it getting reported on that sheep were cloned to want to play poker, for no reason. Brain wishes he had that cloning device, as if he couldn’t make one himself for some reason. Actually, he has no reason for not making it himself because he made a clone son of his with a cloning device. This must be before that.\n\nPinky annoys him on purpose and somehow doesn’t know how to use the remote to turn the TV back on. Brain turns it on to shut him up. Spock’s drawn to look so ugly just for a joke. It’s confusing how sometimes the comic’s allowed to reference things and other times it has to use different names and stuff to make fun of something instead of it being consistent.\n\nPinky says any scientist would do anything for Spock, which makes Brain say that he’s made him very happy, so it’s kind of understandable how Pinky’s reaction to his question is this time. Pinky sprays his own mouth, and Brain tells him with a nervous smile that they shouldn’t let their enthusiasm overwhelm them. Usually in a moment like this he’ll get annoyed with him, not act like this.\n\nSomehow, his plan is to use Pinky’s Halloween costumes and dress up as Spock. There’s no reason for why he’d think he’d actually have people think he’s Spock because he’s clearly a tiny talking mouse. Even if people believed he was Spock despite the fact that they know he’s fictional, they’d ask why he looks like this. I thought Brain was gonna make a new Spock.\n\nHe somehow thinks scientists would give him their cloning machine secrets just because he’s cosplaying as Spock. He says he’ll clone an army genetically dependent on a TV show, and unless they watch the show every night, his army would rampage, forcing the world to surrender to him.\n\nI like that he at least says that something else could happen instead, because the producers could release new episodes. Wouldn’t he know that the army could just be shown reruns of the show on DVD or something and be satisfied? Maybe it wasn’t released on any physical media in this universe.\n\nWhy would he make them have a dependency on that at all instead of just having them lie that they have a dependency to it? That way he’d increase the likelihood that Xena would get more episodes, AND have an army that wouldn’t be made to stop rampaging so easily. It sure is a shame for him that he’s too lazy and impatient to try to figure out how to make that cloning machine himself, when he’d have faith in his own ability to do that. It should’ve been a robot-making machine instead, because Romy exists.\n\nIt’s nice of Brain to let Pinky dress up as whatever he wants. He tells him to give him Star Trek trivia on the other end of the walky talky in the unlikely case that he’d need it. We see Pinky and Brain hiding under the wig of a scientist and Pinky says it was a brilliant way to sneak into the lab.\n\nThe guy would hear them and react to them, and he’d immediately notice that his wig was taken off because his head would feel colder, and he cared enough to start wearing a wig in the first place. So why does he ignore them when they jump away carrying it?\n\nBrain embarrasses himself in front of the scientists, somehow saying Spock’s greeting horribly wrong. Somehow one of the scientists believes him that Spock and his crew are real. I guess it’s believable because lots of crazy things happen in Star Trek, so he could conclude that Spock being turned into a mouse could happen.\n\nSo if he doesn’t know about Brain and talking mice existing, then merely seeing a talking mouse claiming to be Spock would be proof enough for a Star Trek fan that he’s not lying, because who else could that be? Brain’s still lucky that he doesn’t recognize him as Brain anyways after all the trouble he’s caused. He destroyed a restaurant earlier.\n\nAt least one of the scientists says he doesn’t know if he’s the real Spock and says they’re not stupid. Brain says he’ll contact his crew to dispel their doubts and talks into the walky talky. He tells Pinky to get him the captain’s log. Surprisingly he says useless things sounding crazy, so he’d rather have fun with him.\n\nBrain smartly comes up with a lie to cover this up, and says, “ As you can see, they’ve gone quite mad. “ But that doesn’t explain why it was Pinky’s voice coming out of the walky talky, or why he looks like a talking mouse, and sounds nothing like Spock. Why aren’t these guys asking how this happened? They just assume it’s because of aliens? Brain says he needs a cloning device to make a new crew.\n\nSo in a surprisingly believable way, he’s given access to the disc. For no reason he says, “ nanu nanu, “ once again trying to say something like Spock for no reason when that didn’t work the first time, and that causes one of them to take away the disc, and the scientists get mad at him and accuse him of being a spy.\n\nFinally he’s asked why he’s so short and he says it was a malfunction in the transport beam. You’d think that that’d explain why he’s so fat as well, but instead he gets asked that too and Brain says shipboard food is murder on long missions, when that wouldn’t be seen as a good excuse because Spock isn’t slightly overweight most of the time.\n\nBrain says he’ll be happy to do the Vulcan nerve pinch, and he tries to call Pinky, who decides to warm up the toupee in the microwave oven before returning it to the scientist. I can actually understand why because it’d feel better on his head if it was a little warmer. And he wears it on his head like a hat. And I just have to assume the reason for why he’s ignoring Brain is that he wants to get back at him. He’s just good at being subtle about it because Brain thinks he’s a crazy idiot, so he makes it so easy for him.\n\nBrain’s expected to fight a guy who has an ancient weapon here for no reason. Then he runs up to Pinky who’s actually carrying the disc for him. He tells Brain he did a job well done. Pinky says he almost forgot the wig and the oven’s smoking. He could’ve so easily not decided to microwave that total stranger’s wig. Brain didn’t have to tell Pinky he was ever planning to return it to him.\n\nBrain says the disc is too heavy and it falls on him. If he made himself unusually strong, that wouldn’t have happened. I’ve seen him with a strength enhancing machine twice, so why didn’t he think to bring one?\n\nHe warns Pinky not to open that and out of nowhere he warns him that it’s not a microwave oven. That would explain why it’s that unsightly shade of green. I was wondering about that but I thought it was just because it was a cartoon. The scientists accuse them of trying to sabotage their cloning device.\n\nThe only important thing that happens is that a bunch of wigs fly out of the cloning device. That doesn’t make sense because they have no reason to get sent flying out, and there’s more wigs in there than could actually fit in it.\n\nThis story by Dana Kurtin and Jesse McCann is about Brain deciding to use a Halloween costume of Pinky’s to disguise himself as Spock and fool scientists into giving him a disc about their cloning machine. He looks nothing like Spock. I thought he’d make a Spock resembling robot.\n\nBut when you think about it, it is surprisingly believable that he fools them because they’re already Star Trek fans so they’d want it to be real, and he’s a talking mouse, so if they don’t know talking mice exist in their world, they’d go with the only explanation they’re being given for what they’re seeing, and while Spock being turned into a mouse seems too silly for the show, I doubt it’s something that’s impossible in Star Trek.\n\nBut the plan fails because Pinky tries to microwave the wig he stole after hiding under it to get into the lab, and it turns out the microwave oven was a cloning machine that could’ve easily not looked the way it did. I guess it was only based on a microwave because of laziness. So the scientists see the smoke coming out of it from the fact that he made too many wigs and accuse them of sabotaging it.\n\nI have to just assume Pinky was trying to do the bald guy a favor by microwaving his wig, because he thinks it’d feel better if it was warm. He could’ve easily not decided to do that, but clothes feel nice after they just came out of the dryer, so I can see where he got the idea, combined with the fact that he’s compassionate.\n\nAnd I’m forced to assume that Brain either doesn’t have the resources to make a cloning machine yet, or he’d rather go steal one and save himself the trouble, but still knows he can make one, because he wants to get things done faster. But still, after this he should just make the machine himself, which could’ve avoided all of this.\n\nAnimaniacs Issue 37:\n\nThe story starts out in a really boring way because Brain’s being recorded and talks to an audience in a boring way, and we don’t know what he’s up to. How’d he get a TV show? He clearly looks sad as he asks kids to be his neighbor and says they have a fun show for them today. He wastes time describing what he’s gonna do, and then a toy train comes out of a mouse hole in the wall with a message for him.\n\nBrain says that he’s gonna take over the world today instead and asks kids to bring their parents to the TV set. His right eye looks weird and Pinky shows up holding the script Brain was reading off from afar, with his excellent vision. Pinky points out that the kids could just switch channels, and Brain says the kids will listen to him just because the public believes whatever it sees on TV. What does that have to do with that? He plans on using a hypnotic device with a bad name. Did he use the device to get a TV show? He’s got no credentials.\n\nHe tells Pinky to keep those cue cards in order, and he trips on a wire and drops them and gets them mixed up. It sure is a shame he didn’t do the cue card holding and leave the TV part to Pinky, which would’ve been better because Pinky’s more entertaining, so he’d be charismatic as opposed to him. He says the wrong things and then yells at Pinky to quit fooling around, while he’s being recorded, which of course wouldn’t be charming for the audience.\n\nPinky apologizes, and Brain says he’ll handle this himself, and says they don’t have any commercial breaks, so they have to keep rolling. And he naturally assumes the kids would stop watching if he gave Pinky the time to get the cue cards in the proper order, but this is a Mr. Rogers style show, so they have literally nothing else to watch for their a"
