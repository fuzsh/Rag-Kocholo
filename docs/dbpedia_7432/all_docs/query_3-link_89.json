        "text": "I was clued on to this idea for a top 10 list from someone who commented on my top 15 anime series list. He said that I should do a list for my non-anime cartoon series. Got me to thinking. Now, a few things to know going into this. First, I grew up in a lower-middle class family. We didn’t have cable, growing up. So my knowledge of cartoons is rather limited. Second, I haven’t kept up in a long time. Cartoons as I understood them died out a long time ago anyway. For the days when I would wake up on a Saturday morning and watch Digimon (which will not be on this list. It’s anime. I made a list for that) or any number of cool shows. It kills me how great kid’s TV died not long after the 90’s. Right along with rock. But that’s a whole other deal. Here is the list of cartoons that I grew up with,\n\n10. Fillmore!\n\nWhat do you get when you get the same animation team behind Recess and have them do a show about middle school safety officers that is basically taking the police procedural series and making it about school crimes? You get one of the coolest shows I used to watch. This series came out late in my youth. I was the perfect age for it, as I was in middle school when it came out. A pity that it wasn’t cool like this. Oh well. I have a theory about Ingrid Third and her personality that I wrote about in another post. Perhaps some of you will know which one I’m talking about.\n\n9. Animaniacs\n\nSome of you may be wondering why it’s so low on this list, because no one can argue that this wasn’t a series of quality. Unfortunately, it’s because I don’t remember this series as much as I do others. I remember that it was awesome, and I loved it, but the memory is more than a little faded. The by-product of a head injury. Still, this series was fantastic. Some of the greatest writing you’ll ever see, with jokes that are mature and still hold up. It was amazing how hardcore this series could go with its euphemisms and innuendos. For the days when the makers of kid’s programming had balls. Though, maybe some of that’s coming back. After all, Legend of Korra did have someone’s head explode. Perhaps there’s hope.\n\n8. Kim Possible\n\nHow many of you are judging me? I can tell. For all the SJWs who talk about how there are no good female characters, I am amazed that this series has gotten overlooked. We have a badass heroine who has a bumbling sidekick who is still loyal, persistent, and their friendship is believable. What’s more, their inevitable romance is believable. This show was just fun to watch. Again, I was in middle school when this came out, so it also caught me at the right time. It’s a fun spy action series, with a chick as a protagonist. Like teenage Tomb Raider. Given the midriff bearing outfits Kim wore, that works for me. You all have that one show that you aren’t proud of, so whatever for judging me.\n\n7. Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\n\nWhen I saw the Nostalgia Critic’s video about this show, I’m not gonna lie – it felt nostalgic. I feel no shame in admitting – I loved this bonkers mess. This series was insane. Batshit crazy. And I loved every minute of it! Growing up, I was a huge Sonic fan. The first console I ever had was a Sega Genesis, and the first game I had on it was Sonic 2. My oldest friend and I were so dedicated to that game that we made a diagram about how the final boss’s attacks worked so we could beat him. When we finally did, the two of us felt so damn accomplished! It was awesome! So this show was just at the right time for me. Was it nuts? Oh yeah. Was me liking it a sign of perhaps how crazy I am? Potentially. But I still loved this bananas show, and some part of me always will.\n\n6. Superman: The Animated Series\n\nAnyone who knows me knows that I don’t like Superman. He’s so cheap! The guy is basically invincible. However, this show came out on the coattails of another series that you are going to see MUCH higher on this list, and I was still into it. Maybe it was the fact that I have always loved Lex Luthor was a villain. Maybe it was the awesome animation. Maybe it was the baddies, who are still awesome, even if the other series had better ones. Whatever it is, the reality is that I really liked this series. That nostalgia has faded over the years, as I grew up and grew my opinion on this character. However, this is still a show I grew up with. Take that for what you will.\n\n5. Garfield and Friends\n\nWe are getting into the series that not only did I love as a kid, but I still love. As a kid, I read the Garfield comics to death! I still do, but now on my phone. Garfield was a character that always seemed to get me. He was an asshole, but always got his way. He was mean, but caring when he needed to be. He treated Jon like shit, yet was still compassionate to him and rewarded his owner’s dedication to him. Then you have this series, and they got the perfect person to voice him – the late Lorenzo Music. Rest in peace, old buddy. He brought my favorite comic character to life in a show that didn’t have the greatest animation, but had so much heart that it just worked. I own all the animated specials, and I may put the whole series on a Christmas/Birthday list in the future. It’s a classic, and every time I see it, it makes me feel like a kid again.\n\n4. Pinky and the Brain\n\nThis show is such a classic! Everything about this series is perfect. Absolutely everything. There is nothing about this show that I am not in love with. You have the titular characters, who have the perfect relationship as roomies who have to deal with one-another. You have the flawless animation. There’s the hilarious antics that never fail to bring a smile to my face. My favorite part of episodes of Animaniacs was these sketches, so when they got their own show, I was in love. Brain and I would get along so well. At least as a kid. Now I’m kind of a cold-blooded cynic/misanthrope. Anyone who doesn’t like this series is a total piece of shit. Fact.\n\n3. Freakazoid\n\nWhy did this animation studio go under? Oh, right, as it says in the hilarious title, if we don’t watch, they’ll be unemployed. Such a bummer. The greatest spoof on superheroes of all time. The Tick was funny, but I’m sorry, this is infinitely better. It’s the WB version of Deadpool. The Fourth Wall did not exist to this guy. Every episode was drowning in hilarity. I loved the character, his villains, and the especially the cop who had to put up with their bullshit. How such an amazing show like this could go under is beyond me. Kids must have gotten very dumb or something.\n\n2. Recess\n\nThis series is the quintessential linchpin of my childhood. Not only was every episode perfect, but it had the greatest protagonist of all time – TJ Detweiler. That kid was my idol, growing up. But I would be remiss without talking about how awesome every single character in this entire series was. I love them all. Even the villains. The reason I love them is because they are all three-dimensional. The Ashleys are more than just a bunch of prissy bitches. Principal Prickley isn’t just a jerk authority figure. He’s doing the best he can to run a school, and genuinely does have affection for the kids. Throughout the entire series, you grow to care about these characters, and when it ends, it’s all so bittersweet.\n\nAnd my favorite series that I grew up with is…\n\n1. Batman: The Animated Series\n\nYou all knew this was coming. I loved this show. I own this show in its entirety. This series is flawless. Every episode is awesome. Not one falls flat. There are the cool characters, the fantastic plots. It stars my favorite anti-hero. There is Mark Hamill’s INCREDIBLE performance as the Joker. This series will go down in history as one of the greatest ever made. The animation, the voice acting, I could praise it forever. I loved the dark and brooding nature. Every time I hear that theme song, to this day, I feel so good inside. Wish I hadn’t left those DVDs out at the parents. Will have to grab those, next time I go out there.\n\nWhat are your favorite cartoons that you grew up with? Let me know down in the Comments.\n\nUntil next time, a quote,\n\n“The Joker’s plans make sense to him and him alone.” – Batman, Batman: The Animated Series\n\nPeace out,\n\nMaverick\n\nYou ever notice as a kid that there were some characters who were a little off? You noticed little things about them that made you think that they were different. Then, as you get older you look back and you realize – I get it! Not all of these character decisions were intentional. I doubt that we will ever know which ones are and which ones aren’t. Some of these characters are old, some are new. This is all interpretation, and you may see my interpretation as wrong. Feel free to argue with me, if you are of a mind to. I would welcome the debate. These are the top 10 characters who, with all the character I saw in them, said one thing to me – they are SO gay!\n\n10. Prince John\n\nRobin Hood\n\nBefore you say that the fact that this guy is an effeminate character does not make him gay – I know! I am not going after him just because he is a flaming queen. I am going after him because he is a flaming queen and he’s SO married to his sidekick, Hiss. Listen to the dialogue between those two and they such a married couple! It’s almost funny how they sound like a middle-aged and constantly arguing husband and wife, with Prince John as the beaten-down husband and Hiss as the nagging wife who is constantly belittling him for his actions. Their fights seem like they are married, their dialogue sounds like something two married couples have and aside from the fact that they almost never seem to have any resolution, they get on like a middle-aged couple. So yeah, these two are married, plain and simple.\n\n9. Brain and Pinky\n\nPinky and the Brain\n\nRemember all the reasons I listed for why Prince John and Hiss are a married couple? Well, double that for these two. Just like them, Brain and Pinky have the dynamic of an older married couple. There is one crucial difference – there is affection between them. There are times when Brain actually hurts Pinky’s feelings and goes out of his way to make up for it. Granted, he also treats him like nothing more than a pain in his ass sometimes, but he still does try and do right by his mate. It’s not cool enough for it to be friendship. They have little report in that area. But it does feel real in respect to what married couples do. Also, there is emotional intimacy between them. Pinky feels for Brain constantly and consistently wishes to make him happy, even to his own detriment. It’s the level of compassion from his would-be husband that makes Pinky wish to be a kinder partner to him.\n\n8. Ingrid Third\n\nFilmore!\n\nMuch like someone much higher on the list, this character and her orientation became clear to me once I actually thought about it. First, Ingrid is consistently the outcast in her school. They make it out to be the fact that she wears all black and seems to do her own thing. However, there are a lot of little subtle clues that that isn’t what it is about. First, whereas you see Filmore and many other characters who have romantic attachments to various other characters, Ingrid never seems to do that. In fact, she is very detached from other students, romantically. One could argue that she has a thing for Filmore, but I don’t think so. The first sign of attraction is in the episode where she goes undercover in the club the Red Robins. The leader of the organization becomes a mentor to her, and you do see the two of them emotionally bond. There are points where it almost feels romantic. It’s written all over Ingrid’s face that she has feelings for someone that she knows she has to betray. So yeah, I doubt that it was intentional on the part of the people who made the show, but there it is.\n\n7. Princess Bubblegum and Marceline\n\nAdventure Time\n\nNow, this is a somewhat controversial choice, given all the argument that has been made about it. For my own part, I watched the episodes that people believe hinted at these two characters having a deeper connection than just friends, and I gotta say – there is a definite argument to be made. Much like the rest of the show, it isn’t shoved in your face what you should believe. This series is known for letting viewers come to their own conclusion about what all the madness means, and the relationship between these two was no exception. If you disagree, I understand. For a show that seems to be about madness and a lack of logic, this make just as much sense as the rest. Still, I agree with those who say that there was something between these two.\n\n6. Squidward\n\nSpongebob Square Pants\n\nThis was a hard choice. I could have just as easily gone with Spongebob and Patrick. Cthulhu knows that they certainly do look and act like a couple. However, the one who I believe was openly gay was Squidward. There is probably no more miserable character in children’s television, with the exception of Eeyore. Squidward hates pretty much everybody and doesn’t have any desire to get outside of his little world. This implies that something has crawled up his ass pretty far. I think it is him having to live in something of a closet. He wants to be as open as his neighbor and his life-partner, but can’t. He isn’t brave enough to face who he really is. It doesn’t help that he is also stuck in a job he hates and has a neighbor who is an insane lunatic from the asylum. So yeah, lot of stuff going on up in that head. Gotta wonder how he keeps it together.\n\n5. Sulu\n\nStar Trek\n\nNow, before I talk about this, let me say that this is NOT because the actor George Takei is gay. Not at all! This has nothing to do with real-life connection. What it does have to do with is the fact that this guy is such a flaming queen in the series. I mean, for real, WHO can watch the scene where he is fencing without a shirt on and not think – wow is that guy gay! Don’t get me wrong, I have no problem with it. But still, totally blatant. Not to mention – in a series that was all about talking about culturally harsh issues, like when Kirk kisses a black woman on national television (which was a HUGE thing back in the day). Maybe they were quietly talking about gayness as well. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised, but that’s just me.\n\n4. Luna Lovegood\n\nHarry Potter\n\nMuch like Ingrid Third, this is a character who I came to realize what was her business when I really thought about it. And it is rather complicated. Much like the girl herself, nothing is simple. Part of the reason that I like her character so much. But think about this – Luna is perpetually bullied by almost the entirety of the student body. Her stuff is consistently stolen and she is ostracized by the student body at large. The books say that this is because she is kind of odd, but does it make sense to you that she would get as much abuse as she does simply because she’s different? Doesn’t make much sense to me. Then some of the blanks started filling in. First – she shows absolutely no interest in guys. She gets excited when Harry asks her to Slughorn’s party, but that is simply because a friend has never asked her to do anything. Ever. She has almost no friends, except those she made in Dumbledore’s Army. She also forms a close bond with Neville (who I also suspect of being gay, which could make sense why they are friends – both of them get each other). What’s more, Hogwart’s education is terrible. They are being taught a 15th century form of education. Who’s to say that they don’t have that mentality as well? I mean, how many kids are openly gay there anyway? It makes sense when you think about it critically. Say that I’m over-analyzing, but I think I’m on to something here. Of course, I am only talking about the novel versions of this character. The films totally effed her up!\n\n3. Shang\n\nMulan\n\nWhen I posed this idea to people, I got a surprising amount of negative feedback. Maybe it’s because it’s a Disney film and people don’t want the primary love interest to not work out. But come on, people! First, Shang was starting to form a romantic attachment to Ping. He had no idea that it was Mulan posing as him. Sure, as far as guys go, he’s an effeminate guy, but Shang still saw her as a man. And he was becoming romantically drawn to him. It really isn’t a stretch to believe that part of the reason that he became when he found out that she is a woman is because he now was incredibly confused. If he already knew he was gay, then he is left to wonder what his orientation really is. If he didn’t, then he is still equally confused, but with a self-loathing side that might now be blaming himself for wanting a man. Either way, this isn’t me pulling at strings. It’s all right there.\n\n2. Albus Dumbledore\n\nHarry Potter (series)\n\nThis one seems like a given, right? On the one hand, JK Rowling said that he was gay, so we could just take her word for it. But let’s look a little deeper than that. In-text, it is pretty clear that he is totally gay. For starters, he has never had a wife, and shows no interest in getting one. And if you think about what I said in respect to Luna, if my theory is correct and the LGBT community hasn’t gained large-scale acceptance within the wizarding community, he may have faced just as much persecution because of it. Were it not for his contributions to the community and his status among them, he might not have gotten anywhere near as far as he did. Plus, when you see him bond with Harry, especially when he’s older, and Dumbledore can see some of himself in Harry. Did you ever notice how he never, and I do mean never, asks Harry about his love life? The two talk about relationships between random characters, but often Dumbledore seems like an outsider to it, like the loves that other characters have are a mystery to him. Always in mysteries, Dumbledore kept even his romances close.\n\nAnd the top character(s) who we all never noticed was gay is…\n\n1. Bert and Ernie\n\nSesame Street\n\nThese two are the oldest gay couple on television. That is a fact! I don’t suppose I have to go into what makes them a gay couple. I mean, you’ve seen Prince John and Hiss, Brain and Pinky. Just like them, these two are like two married couple who is well into middle age. Ernie is much more youthful than Bert. You can almost see the two of them having a much wilder history that at some point Bert grew out of, yet Ernie retained. Despite the overwhelming differences between them, their love stays strong mostly due to the level of dedication that both of them put into the relationship. While Ernie is the more outgoing of the two, Bert still has his romantic moments where he tries to be kind to his husband. Say what you will, but it’s hard to deny the fact that these two are a gay couple, and have been for a LONG time.\n\nSo, any other openly gay characters you grew up with who you didn’t notice until you got older? Let me know in the comments section.\n\nUntil next time, a quote,\n\n“Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.” -Luna Lovegood, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nPeace out,\n\nMaverick\n\nYou remember when you were a little kid, and you used to watch TV shows? Remember when these shows were good? Remember when there used to be stuff that was actually smart on TV? Thankfully, it is seeing a resurgence, but the fact is that smart is not something that appears in overwhelming amounts anymore on TV, especially where kid’s shows are concerned. Now, I was thinking about doing a post on the top 10 nostalgic kid’s shows that I grew up with, but rather than do that, I thought about taking the characters who really made an impact with me. The ones who I remembered, even to this day. The ones who really got me to thinking about stuff. With that in mind, I give you my list of the characters from the shows that I watched, who have still stuck with me in a lot of ways, even today.\n\n10. Tom Paris\n\nStar Trek Voyager\n\nIf you are a hater of this show, piss off. I happened to like it. While there were elements that didn’t hit so well, like that stupid-ass outfit they stuck Seven of Nine in (seriously, did you see the episode where she is in uniform? She was much more attractive in that!), they did a lot right, and it is a credit to the Star Trek franchise. And by far my favorite character who me and the parents who sit down to watch was Tom Paris. Paris was the helmsman, the pilot. He was skilled at what he did and competant in many areas. This guy had it all going on. He was cool, he was fun. He was a smart-ass, he was a rebel. He would disobey and fight for what is right, even when it got him in a lot of trouble. This was the character for the young guy’s crowd, and he was well-portrayed. He wasn’t like Robin from Batman: The Animated Series, doing stupid stuff that incompetant writers feel can connect with younger people. He was just himself, and it was fun to see. I really liked this show, and he was a big reason why.\n\n9. Evil Tommy/Green Ranger\n\nPower Rangers\n\nTo anybody who was a kid in the early 90’s, you watched Power Rangers. Don’t deny it! Just accept that you watched this show, and that this was by far the coolest character. I have always loved a villain more than a hero. And when he was a villain, man was this guy cool! He kicked so much ass! He had the moves, he had the look. Even his Megazord was a badass dragon! He would kick your ass in and out of costume, and he was the thing that made the show. Sure, when he became good, he was still cool, but let’s fact it, watching him beat the shit out of all the other Power Rangers was lots of fun, and when we got older, we could have fun imagining him and an evil Kimberly having crazy and kinky romps together! (She would turn evil for him. He is that awesome) He was a really cool addition to a really silly show that we all watched and enjoyed.\n\n8. Ms. Frizzle\n\nThe Magic School Bus\n\nI don’t think that there is a kid who grew up in my generation who doesn’t know this bat-shit crazy broad and her utterly absurd and often dangerous adventures that she took her students on with a magic bus. She was funny, weird, and enjoyably over the top. You liked how much fun she was having, and how much she enjoyed her position in life. You learned a lot watching her show, and since the lessons were fun, you wanted to get more of them. The animation was interesting, and all of the characters in that show were unique. Ms. Frizzle was most definitely a staple of my childhood because she made the idea of learning about the world exciting. Ever since she has disappeared, PBS has seemingly lost the ability to make such likeable characters, every time I was baby-sitting and tuned in. For real, she was a lot of fun, and I, as an adult, still think it’s a good show.\n\n7. Wufei Chang\n\nGundam Wing\n\nThis was the first anime that I had ever seen, and I was immediately drawn to Wufei. He is a Gundam pilot who fights for honor, for his own sense of integrity. True, he is fighting a battle for vengeance, but the fact is that he is fighting for what he believes is right. A lot of people think that Wufei is sexist and hates women. Not true. He hates weak women. When he met Sally Po and saw that she would keep fighting her guerilla war, knowing that all the odds were stacked against her, he showed a lot of genuine respect. He hates women who are led by their emotions, women who let their kindness get the better of them, especially in military situations. But he is an amazing warrior, and a hell of a pilot. For it being the first anime I saw, I was introduced to the genre with an amazing show. Gundam Wing challenged a lot of themes like the innocence of youth, the value of war, and what true peace really means. It is a lot of fun.\n\n6. Freakazoid\n\nFreakazoid (Duh)\n\nI think a lot of how I talk and my general approach to things that are legitimately serious came from this character. This show still gives me big laughs, even now. Partly produced by Steven Spielberg, this show was a parody of all superhero shows, and I love it. Freakazoid is by far the strangest character ever to greet children’s shows. He doesn’t take what he is doing seriously at all, and makes a big joke about it. This guy really is a little bit nuts, and his villains are all totally not the stereotypes that we all assume we will see. It’s kind of a bummer that the show only lasted two seasons. I would loved to have seen how far they could go with this character. But yeah, my way of saying things in strange ways and not taking a serious approach to the big stuff mostly came from old episodes of Freakazoid. A great show, if you are ever in the market.\n\n5. Sonic the Hedgehog\n\nThe Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\n\nIt’s so ironic that I love the Nostalgia Critic’s videos. He did a review of this show, talking about how bad it was, and how bat-shit crazy it is. I remember being really young and looking forward to seeing this show. I don’t know what it was, but I just loved watching it. Maybe it is because I am a little bat-shit crazy myself. I kind of dug the absolute insanity and the total lack of focus that this show had. And I am also a die-hard Sonic the Hedgehog fan. Still, I think what I liked about this character was how weird he was. Normal bores me. It bores the living shit out of me. The more crazy and bizarre something is, the more that I generally tend to enjoy it. Call me crazy, but the thing that I like about this show is that reality and comprehension have nothing to do with it. It’s just nuts.\n\n4. Garfield\n\nGarfield and Friends\n\nThe late Lorenzo Music supplied his voice to a character who I have been a fan of for years. I love the old comics, and this show was just fun. Music’s voice will always be what I associate with this character. He’s fat, he’s mean, he’s a complete jerk, yet for the same reason that we all love Dr. House, we love him because Garfield reflects a part of ourselves. He reflects that part that does what it wants to be evil, and do horrible things. The part of ourselves that is selfish, and feeds only our interests. Garfield is the perfect example of how fun that can be, even if we never take part in it. And I love him for it. This was another of the shows that I just love because of how much I was able to bond with it. And the title character was every reason why. Lorenzo, rest in peace. You won’t be remembered by everyone, but you will most certainly be remembered by me.\n\n3. The Joker\n\nBatman: The Animated Series\n\nI love this show so much. Not only was it grown-up and kid friendly, but the characters were amazing. Mark Hamill’s Joker will always be the real Joker to me. The laugh, the personality. Everything about this character is exactly what I imagined. He was disturbing, scary, and genuinely terrifying at moments. It was the perfect portrayal, and even though I know that Hamill will probably just be remembered as Luke Skywalker, this is the role that he did greatest, for me. I just love how electric this character is. As much as you hate and are afraid of him, it’s almost impossible not to like him just a little bit. My favorites episodes with him in it are in Superman: The Animated Series. I just love how it doesn’t matter who he is bleeding or killing, it’s all the same to him. This character is not only my favorite villain in this show, he is my favorite villain, period. What a great performance.\n\n2. The Brain\n\nPinky and the Brain\n\nIt is completely impossible not to like this character. He is a great pun on evil geniuses. This character is just pure fun. He is a little lab mouse who was experimented on and now possesses massive amounts of genius. His mission is simple – to try and take over the world (of course!)! This guy and his accomplice/wife Pinky just play off one-another. If you are asking why I call Pinky his wife, just watch the show. These two are so much like an old married couple it’s scary. They argue, they fight, they have moments. They even show to genuinely have compassion for one-another, even if it almost always is coming from Pinky. When I was a kid, this is who I wanted to be. I wanted to be the Brain. I wanted to take over the world. Part of me still does. Of course, his crazy schemes not withstanding, I just loved this character and how fun he was to watch. He was so sure that his absolutely nuts ideas would work, and I think that’s just awesome.\n\nAnd the #1 character that I looked up to as a kid is…\n\n1. TJ Detweiler\n\nRecess\n\nI swear, I could do a character analysis about this guy. I may just do that one of these days. More than any other on this list, this is the character that I took the most away from. TJ is so unique in so many ways as a kid’s show character, especially looking at the shows that are on now. For one thing, he openly mocks authority. He will disregard any authority figure that he doesn’t have respect for. While many of the teachers and administrators at Third Street think that he hates them, he has shown that he pulls pranks on them because it is in his nature. He is also not some lean and super-attractive kid. TJ is most surely the everyman. He is a bit chubby, but nobody makes a point of that because of his outgoing and likeable personality. He is honest and has a very strong sense of justice, along with right and wrong. He will protect the common kid, trying to help those that he sees as the down-trodden. He is loyal to his friends and will fight for them. But the part I took away most was the absolute lack of respect for authority unless they proved to be worth respecting. You would NEVER see such a character in a kid’s show these days, and that bugs the shit out of me. But yeah, more than any other, TJ is the character on this list who I try and emulate the most, even to this day.\n\nUntil next time, a quote,\n\n“I don’t have a best friend. I have five!” -TJ Detweiler\n\nPeace out,\n\nMaverick"
