And now two more: Pinky and The Brain are the names. World domination is the aim.\n\nThe two genetically modified Acme Labs mice began 'toon life in supporting segments of Animaniacs. But humble origins could not keep these wannabe rulers from landing their own show. Today, TV. Tomorrow, the world! With a persistence even Wile E. Coyote [Genius] would admire, methodical Brain (Maurice LaMarche) and no-brainer sidekick Pinky (Rob Paulsen) execute one flawed, gadget-driven scheme after another.\n\n\"Are you pondering what I'm pondering?\" Brain asks. With four seasons of this Amblin Entertainment-Warner Bros. animated classic, you'll be laughing more than pondering."
