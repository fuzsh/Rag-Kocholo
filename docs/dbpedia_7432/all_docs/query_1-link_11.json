Howell IVSeptember 24, 1995 ( )2.7[2]\n\nBrain plans to use a \"growing ray\" (originally a \"shrinking ray\") to grow Pinky into super-size while dressed up as Gollyzilla, a gargantuan reptilian kaiju, while Brain would turn himself gargantuan and stop him, using the name Brainodo, in exchange for world domination. However, the real Gollyzilla emerges from the ocean and starts destroying the city, making Brain mistakenly think that the monster is Pinky. The episode ends with the ray going out of control and making everything on Earth grow, including the Earth itself, to the point that Pinky, Brain, and even Gollyzilla are mouse-sized by comparison again.\n\n3b3b\"That Smarts\"Audu PadenPeter HastingsSeptember 24, 1995 ( )2.7[2]\n\nBrain creates a machine that can increase or decrease intelligence and uses it on Pinky so that he can become smart enough to understand that he is the cause of Brain's failures, due to research that Brain conducted. However, Pinky constantly finds flaws in every plan to take over the world that Brain proposes, causing Brain to tell Pinky to leave. Pinky, depressed and thinking that Brain does not like him anymore now that he is smart, gets the idea to use the machine to make himself stupid so that Brain will like him again. However, Brain discovers (based on Pinky's re-calculations of his research) that he himself is the cause of all his failures and that Pinky is now even smarter than he is. Believing both of them to be better off with Pinky as the genius and Brain as the idiot, Brain gets to the machine first and uses it on himself - only to find out that Pinky has now done the same thing after he did. In the end, both of them are idiots and are now too stupid to operate the machine and restore Brain to his intelligent self.[3]\n\n3c3c\"Brainstem\"Greg ReynaTom MintonSeptember 24, 1995 ( )2.7[2]\n\nPinky and Brain sing about the parts of the human brain, to the tune of \"Camptown Races\".\n\n4a4a\"Pinky & the Fog\"Audu PadenGordon Bressack and Charles M.

Taking a job as one of Santa's elves, he puts the doll on every Christmas list in the world, so that every household receives a doll from Santa. When the time comes to switch the machine on, Pinky is horrified to find that his letter to Santa was not given to him and gets upset, but Brain is too concerned with his plan to be interested and forces Pinky to man the equipment. However, just before the machine is switched on, Brain reads Pinky's letter to Santa, which praises Brain despite the fact that he cannot succeed, and asks Santa to give all of Pinky's presents to Brain (along with the world itself, if Santa has it in his sack). Brain, overwhelmed with remorse for his attitude towards his best pal, breaks down in tears and merely orders the world to have a Merry Christmas, after which he smashes the machine in a fit of rage. Back at Acme Labs, Brain gives Pinky a spell checker for Christmas and Pinky gives Brain a key chain of Earth, for which both mice are truly grateful (though Brain is not entirely taken with Pinky's rendition of \"Joy To The World\").[6] This episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 1996.\n\n99\"Snowball\"Audu PadenWendell Morris, Tom Sheppard and Peter HastingsJanuary 21, 1996 ( )2.7[8]\n\nBrain conducts a chain letter scheme that will make him the ruler of the world by simply including a final sentence spelling \"you will bow before the Brain\" backwards.

Brain becomes frustrated and creates a new holiday (Wink Martindale Day) that closes the post office, thus preventing Snowball from mailing the chain letters. Snowball then tries to convince Pinky that Brain is only using him (and offers him fudge), but Pinky refuses to believe him. Later, Snowball buys out the world with his incredible wealth that he has had Bill Grates, the world's richest nerd (a parody of Bill Gates and leader of Microsponge (a parody of Microsoft)) sign over to him, and builds a Pinky-themed amusement park. Pinky begins to consider Snowball's offer, to which Brain replies, not knowing about Snowball's talk with Pinky, \"Oh, go ahead, Pinky, I don't need you. What, do you think I just have you around so I can steal your brilliant ideas and claim them as my own? That I'm just using you? Oh, yes, I'm using you for your brilliance.\" Pinky, unable to distinguish that Brain is just being sarcastic again, accepts Snowball's offer, but eventually ends up missing Brain terribly.
