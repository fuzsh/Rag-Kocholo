That means Kyoto should work the cow and the game forest should be cleared and mined. Then you can have 5 fpt and a possible 4 turn settler factory. Also, the other cow town should've had it's cow irrigated not mined. With the despot penalty, mining does NOTHING for a plains cow.\n\nOtherwise, good trading, expansion, and exploration so far.

The rest belong to The Brain.\n\nJournal Entry 4​\n\nGreetings, loyal subjects. I am your ruler, The Brain. Please forgive my whispering, but Pinky is driving me mad with his nonsensical utterances. Currently, my associate is in the stables visiting that goofy-looking white horse. Pinky tells me that the horses name is PharFigNewton. He also says that they are in love. Im getting a headache. I will attempt to get through this Entry as expeditiously as possible before Pinky returns. I may have only moments before he returns, so heres what happened this TurnSet:\n\nOn the second turn of the TurnSet, I obtain Iron Working from the Celts for 45 Gold and 5 GPT. I hastily look at the map to see if there is any Iron in the vicinity. To my chagrin, I notice that there are only 3 deposits of Iron on the map.\n\n​\n\nThe Iron Deposit closest to us is in the middle of the landmass. Curse the luck! The Celts will get to the westernmost deposit and The Portugese will get to the southernmost deposit long before I will. That leaves the northernmost deposit for me . . . I mean, us! As you can see, my . . . I mean, our deposit lies in a mountain range, but on closer scrutiny, there is a place for a city at the foot of the mountain and, as an added bonus, there would be Spices in the City! YES!\n\nMy new Science Advisor (named HELLO NURSE!) pops her head in, and wants to knows what to switch her research to. I am about to correct her grammar but I am smitten. I tell her to research The Alphabet.\n\nAfter the sixth turn, my Domestic Advisor (named CivAssist II. I remember her father fondly. Odd that he would name his daughter after himself, but I digress) tells me that the word on the street is that Osaka is about to RIOT! I immediately visit Osaka, and tell one of the citizens to be a Scientist. Whew! Crisis is averted!\n\nOn the seventh turn, Satsuma is founded.\n\nAfter the twelfth turn, Edo begins construction on The Colossus!\n\nOn the thirteenth turn, Kagoshima is founded.\n\nOn the fourteenth turn, Nara is founded. Also, I contact Portugal. I buy Masonry for 35 Gold and +4 GPT.\n\nOn the fifteenth turn, I notice that my Empire is running at a deficit. I lower SCI to 0% to balance the budget.\n\nThat is all that happened this turn. The workers worked, and the various Military units explored.\n\nOur new Workers: Slappy Squirrel, Thaddeus Plotz, and Minerva Mink.\n\nEND OF TURNSET: 1000 BC, 31 Gold (+6 per turn)\n\nAlphabet in 12 Turns. 100% TAX, 0% SCI, 0% LUX.\n\nOur Territory:\n\nMini Map\n\n​\n\nThe door opens, and Pinky walks in very happily.\n\n\"What are you doing in here all by yourself, Brain? NARF!\"\n\nOh, my head. Never mind.\n\nCome, Pinky, we must prepare for tomorrow night!\n\n\"Why? What are we doing tomorrow night, Brain?\"\n\nThe same thing we do every night, Pinky!

We are extremely busy this time of year with the holidays. Once all of the schools go back in after XMas Break, things should settle down.\n\nThank you for your patience.\n\nE626\n\nEdit 1/11/2008: Geez! Just once I'd like for the paychecks to show up at a decent time. I didn't get home today until about 5:00PM, so, sorry, folks, turnset is postponed for another week.\n\nExperiment 626\n\nPrince\n\nJoined\n\nOct 12, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n407\n\nLocation\n\nEscaped from Jumba's lab\n\nJan 17, 2008\n\n#31\n\nAuthor's Note: It looks like I have to be at work all day tomorrow, so I went ahead and played the next TurnSet today. I apologize for the brevity (and lack of humor) of this Entry. You good people have been waiting patiently (somewhat ), and I didn't want you to have to wait another week or so.\n\n*********\n\nJOURNAL ENTRY 5​\n\nAgain, Pinky's lines are in quotes. The rest belong to The Brain.\n\n*********\n\nOh, my aching head! If Pinky doesn't stop talking about PharFigNewton, I fear that I will go mad. Amongst his ramblings, I have discovered that Pinky has relieved Booga of his duties. (Player's note: I accidentally disbanded him). He says that he felt sorry for Booga being all alone in the wilderness so far from home that he just had to let him go. I sent Pinky out to the stables so PharFigNewton doesn't get lonely. He could return at any time, so I will be brief.\n\nNew Cities: Nagoya, Izumo, and Yokohama.\n\nNew Worker: Skippy Squirrel.\n\nPortugal established an Embassy with us, and we established an Embassy with the Celts.\n\nWe learned Alphabet, and bought Writing from Portugal for 148 Gold +1 per turn.\n\nIroquois completed The Colossus. Edo (which had been building The Colossus) changed to building a Granary.\n\nOh no! Pinky is returning! Here's our Territory. We have a Settler very close to the Iron. Hopefully, my Military out there can protect the new city until I can get more cities out there.\n\n​\n\n\"Hello, Brain! Isn't love wonderful? NARF! Umm . . . Brain? Why are you banging your head against the wall?\"\n\nNever mind.\n\nCome, Pinky, we must prepare for tomorrow night!\n\n\"Why? What are we doing tomorrow night, Brain?\"\n\nThe same thing we do every night, Pinky! TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!\n\nSinging is heard, \"They're Pinky . . .

Expansion is never a bad thing, but if your planning to win by conquest, you should have a big enough core now to do it.\n\nPlus, your position on a peninsula makes you very secure against counter attack. I don't think you will really be attacked all game.\n\nSo get a bunch of horsemen built and go out and kill!\n\nWhen Chivalry rolls around, you can switch to Samurai production.\n\nJan 18, 2008\n\n#34\n\nBeing on a peninsula will make this much easier. Nice.\n\nBut don't expect everyone to be on the big land. There will be one AI that starts on an island and you'll need boats to kill him. Trading contacts will locate the island-starters. Don't waste time looking for them.\n\nYou've got a good looking core, so let's start killing!\n\nAutomatedTeller\n\nFrequent poster\n\nJoined\n\nJan 25, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n7,540\n\nLocation\n\nMedford, MA\n\nJan 21, 2008\n\n#35\n\nThere are some things that bother me about the state of the civ, oh mighty shogun.\n\nWe have 3 towns with barracks, one of which is building a granary, one of which is producing a settler and one of which is producing a curragh - ie, none of them are producing military.\n\nTokyo is 6 turns from producing a settler, but is only size 1.\n\nWe have 1 town without a barracks producing a warrior.\n\nThe news that Portugal established an embassy with us is not necessarily good news for us - we should be on the lookout for a stack of portugese military. It may not come, but I have found that AI establishing embassies is often a prelude to finding you for attacks.\n\nExperiment 626\n\nPrince\n\nJoined\n\nOct 12, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n407\n\nLocation\n\nEscaped from Jumba's lab\n\nFeb 8, 2008\n\n#36\n\nI hate to sound like a broken record, but it might be another week or two before I play the next TurnSet.

There's just too much going on right now.\n\nI apologize most humbly and deeply. You deserve better.\n\nThe game isn't dead, but let's just say that it's on Stand-By for the time being. I've reread the past 2 Journal Entries, and they're just not funny enough. I can play the TurnSet in probably a hour or so (taking notes along the way), but turning my notes into a proper Journal Entry (with lots of laughs (hopefully)) just takes too long.\n\nI'll pop in from time to time to see what's going on, but the game is halted (but not dead) for now.\n\nAgain, my sincerest apologies . . .\n\nE626\n\nMarsden\n\nKeeper of the HoF Annex\n\nJoined\n\nApr 19, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n4,024\n\nLocation\n\nThulcandra\n\nMar 4, 2008\n\n#38\n\nRemember this?\n\nSooo . . .?

Like I said, RL is just way too hectic right now. Again, the game isn't dead, merely on Stand'By.\n\nI understand you being upset and unhappy about this, but, if I'm going to do this game properly, then I need to have the time (not to mention the creativity) to do the Journals correctly, and right now, I just don't have that kind of time or creativity.\n\nI'm sorry."
