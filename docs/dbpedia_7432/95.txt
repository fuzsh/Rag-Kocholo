Pinky and the Brain are cartoon characters from the animated television series Animaniacs. Later, they starred in their own spin-off cartoon show called Pinky and the Brain and even later in Pinky, Elmyra and The Brain. These latter series were produced by Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation, and aired from 1995 to 1998 on The WB Television Network, running for 65 episodes. The two are genetically enhanced lab mice who reside in a cage in the Acme Labs research facility. Each week sees Brain come up with a new plan for the two (led by him) to take over the world, which ultimately ends in failure. In common with many other Animaniacs shorts, many episodes are in some way a parody of something else - usually a film. The cartoon's famous tagline is: - "Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?" - "The same thing we do every night, Pinky: Try to take over the world!". The series won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class - Animated Program in 1999. The show is not currently in reruns, but all of its seasons have been released on DVD.
