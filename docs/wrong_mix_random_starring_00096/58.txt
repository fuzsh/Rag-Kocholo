We are pleased to announce that Adam, Jack and Matt have joined our team.

Project engineers Adam Jazzar and Jack O’Connell have joined us in London, while Matt Cox settled into our Cambridge office as a senior technician. In order of appearance…

Adam returned to the UK from Australia in 2023 where he worked in Perth as a Junior Structural Engineer for IMEC, improving his skills in both concrete and steel design. During his time in hotter climes, Adam was involved in projects across both Australia and the UK, enabling him to work with Australian standards, British codes and Eurocodes.

Jack has spent the last few years working within a design team on a range of major infrastructure and commercial projects. He has Eurocode design experience in steel, concrete, global analysis/structural modelling and steel-to-steel connection design. He is also proficient in structural analysis and design software including Tekla, GSA, Compos, Hilti Profis and IDEA StatiCa.

Matt brings with him 20 years of experience in building detailing and technical drawing. He has developed skills in the drawing production process through 3D modelling and has played a key role in the delivery of production information on several Building Information Modelling (BIM) projects. He is skilled in the use of AutoCAD and Revit. Matt has knowledge of reinforced concrete detailing and is experienced in site surveys, inspections and reports. Prior to this, he spent eight years within the construction industry in planning and project control roles, gaining experience in civils, utilities, commercial and transport sectors.
