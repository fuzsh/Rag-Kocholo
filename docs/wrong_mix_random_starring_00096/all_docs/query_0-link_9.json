        "text": "Journey Beyond the Burrow\n\nBy Rina Heisel,\n\nFrom my list on new action-packed middle grade with heart.\n\nBy Ben Gartner Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love to read a good action-adventure story. I’ve also written a few. And I know that no matter how high the stakes, if there’s no heart in the characters then there’s very little engagement to make it any more memorable than a temporary thrill. I love thrills, but the stories that stick with you after the excitement of the moment is over, those are the true gems. Besides the fun of reading that type of book, maybe you even learn something about yourself or the world and come out a wee bit wiser than when you went in. And isn’t that a fantastic use of our imaginative powers?!\n\nBen's book list on new action-packed middle grade with heart\n\nWhy did Ben love this book?\n\nDo not be fooled by the cuddly creatures on the beautiful cover! This book is full of harrowing adventure, creepy tension, and frightening woodland creatures like giant spiders and deadly snakes. At least, as seen from the perspective of our main character, Tobin the mouse.\n\nTobin’s quest is full of heart, for he has taken it upon himself to save his younger brother from the clutches of the invading spiders who stole him to a faraway lair. Their adventure reminded me of Secret of Nimh or The Lord of the Rings in that we follow a reluctant hero who rises to the occasion and shows their true self over the course of a challenging adventure.\n\nThis is a terrific middle-grade action-adventure story bulging with heart.\n\nBy Rina Heisel,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Journey Beyond the Burrow as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA JUNIOR LIBRARY GUILD GOLD STANDARD SELECTION!\n\nWith the adventure of Avi’s Poppy series and the heart of A Wolf Called Wander, this charming and exciting middle grade adventure follows one mouse’s journey to save his baby brother from a sinister evil.\n\nThere are rules every mouse must follow if they’re to survive in the forest.\n\nTobin knows these guidelines by heart. After all, with one younger sibling, another on the way, and a best friend with a penchant for trouble-making, he needs to be prepared for anything.\n\nBut one stormy night, Tobin’s safe burrow is invaded by monstrous arachnids,…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Last Shadow Warrior\n\nBy Sam Subity,\n\nFrom my list on mythology-inspired middle grade fantasy.\n\nBy Gabrielle K. Byrne Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI had a lot of troubles as a kid, and my favorite escape was getting lost in fairy tales and mythology. For me, those stories were a window into ancient worlds full of strange rules and powers, where magic was real and nothing was outside the bounds of possibility. As an author, I get to build my own stories and worlds inspired by the tales I loved so much as a kid, and I’ve loved reading about new heroes and heroines whose tales are rooted in the powerful traditions of peoples from all over the globe. I’m happy to be sharing some of my recent favorite mythology-inspired books!\n\nGabrielle's book list on mythology-inspired middle grade fantasy\n\nWhy did Gabrielle love this book?\n\nThis fun read, full of humor and adventure, is a mash-up of Viking lore and the story of Beowulf in a contemporary setting. Abby, grieving over the death of her mother, is also at a new school—not to mention training as the last of the Aesir warriors destined to hunt and kill Grendels. When a Grendel starts hunting her instead, Abby has a lot to unravel and conquer, fast.\n\nI adore quirky stories that play with Western myths (heck, I wrote one), and this book has that in spades. For kids that love Norse mythology, this will provide smiles, snorts, and a perfect dose of white-knuckled page-turning. We grow with Abby as she builds new friendships and conquers old fears. She’s a great contemporary heroine with absolutely relatable problems.\n\nBy Sam Subity,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Last Shadow Warrior as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPercy Jackson meets Thor in a laugh-out-loud, action-packed adventure inspired by Norse mythology.\n\nTwelve-year-old Abby Beckett is proud to come from a long line of elite Viking warriors known as the Aesir. She's spent her entire life training to hunt the horrific creatures known as Grendels--the ancient foe of the Aesir--just like her mother did before she died. But there's just one, small problem: No one has seen a Grendel in centuries, and the Viking Council wants to disband the Aesir . . . forever.\n\nWhen her father is injured in an attack that leaves him in a coma, Abby…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Unforgettable Logan Foster\n\nBy Shawn Peters,\n\nFrom my list on new action-packed middle grade with heart.\n\nBy Ben Gartner Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love to read a good action-adventure story. I’ve also written a few. And I know that no matter how high the stakes, if there’s no heart in the characters then there’s very little engagement to make it any more memorable than a temporary thrill. I love thrills, but the stories that stick with you after the excitement of the moment is over, those are the true gems. Besides the fun of reading that type of book, maybe you even learn something about yourself or the world and come out a wee bit wiser than when you went in. And isn’t that a fantastic use of our imaginative powers?!\n\nBen's book list on new action-packed middle grade with heart\n\nWhy did Ben love this book?\n\nLogan Foster is a character who will stick with you. His story is an exciting, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that belongs in the halls of great comic-book-level adventure.\n\nAnd it is also an emotional journey for young Logan, who is seeking a family, wondering about his lost sibling, and looking to find a place in the world. His world just happens to be extraordinary in many action-packed ways.\n\nThis book is laugh-out-loud funny and, yes, sometimes dad-joke groan-worthy too. Because of its combination of excitement and heart, this book has earned a well-deserved spot on this list.\n\nBy Shawn Peters,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Unforgettable Logan Foster as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPacked with superheroes, supervillains, and epic showdowns between good and evil, The Unforgettable Logan Foster from debut author Shawn Peter shows that sometimes being a hero is just about being yourself.\n\nLogan Foster has pretty much given up on the idea of ever being adopted. It could have something to with his awkward manner, his photographic memory, or his affection for reciting curious facts, but whatever the cause, Logan and his \"PP's\" (prospective parents) have never clicked.\n\nThen everything changes when Gil and Margie arrive. Although they aren't exactly perfect themselves-Gil has the punniest sense of humor and Margie's cooking…\n\nPreview\n\nCece Rios and the Desert of Souls\n\nBy Kaela Rivera,\n\nFrom my list on fantasy to escape into when life is overwhelming.\n\nBy Juliana Brandt Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFor me, books have always been an incredible way to escape, most especially when life is overwhelming. I read books as an escape when I was young, and now as an author, I write books to escape as well. My favorite books to escape into always include heart pounding adventure, fantastical magic, and characters I wish I could know in real life. These are the sorts of books I write; ones that give readers the chance to exist as someone else in another place, perhaps go on a wild adventure. My hope as an author is that my books allow readers to leave their own world and their own worries behind.\n\nJuliana's book list on fantasy to escape into when life is overwhelming\n\nWhy did Juliana love this book?\n\nWhen Cece’s older sister is kidnapped by a powerful, dark criatura, she must travel into Devil’s Alley and become a bruja to save her. To me, what makes this book special is Cece’s big, all-encompassing heart. She loves deeply and while it’s her heart that gets her into trouble, but it’s also what ultimately saves her. This was an incredibly meaningful theme to read into a book! I highly recommend this book as an escape; step into Cece’s life to glimpse the shadowy magic of the criaturas and also to experience the deeply moving love in her world.\n\nBy Kaela Rivera,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Cece Rios and the Desert of Souls as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen a powerful desert spirit kidnaps her sister, Cece Rios must learn forbidden magic to get her back, in this own voices middle grade fantasy perfect for fans of The Storm Runner and Aru Shah and the End of Time.\n\nLiving in the remote town of Tierra del Sol is dangerous, especially in the criatura months, when powerful spirits roam the desert and threaten humankind. But Cecelia Rios has always believed there was more to the criaturas, much to her family's disapproval. After all, only brujas-humans who capture and control criaturas-consort with the spirits, and brujeria is a terrible crime.…\n\nPreview\n\nWandering Stars\n\nBy Jack Dann (editor),\n\nWhy did Barbara love this book?\n\nWandering Stars is a landmark anthology that should be the starting point for anyone interested in Jewish science fiction and fantasy. It contains a collection of incredible short stories; it’s nearly impossible to pick out the best. My own favorites include William Tenn’s “On Venus, Have We Got a Rabbi,” Avram Davidson’s “The Golem,” Harlan Ellison’s “I’m Looking for Kadak,” and Isaac Bashevitz Singer’s heartbreaking, “Jachid and Jechidah.”\n\nBy Jack Dann (editor),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Wandering Stars as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nJewish science fiction and fantasy? Yes! The distinguished list of contributors includes: Bernard Malamud, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Isaac Asimov, Robert Silverberg, Harlan Ellison, Pamela Sargent, Avram Davidson, Geo. Alec Effinger, Horace L. Gold, Robert Sheckley, William Tenn, and Carol Carr.\n\nWilliam Tenn's futuristic story \"On Venus, Have We Got A Rabbi\" takes on the volatile issue of \"Who is a Jew?\"--a question certainly as timely in 1998 as he imagines it will be in 2533. Asimov's \"Unto the Fourth Generation\" takes on the issue of Jews as endangered species in America, a theme that is even more apparent today than…\n\nPreview\n\nMonster Theory\n\nBy Jeffrey Jerome Cohen,\n\nWhy did William love this book?\n\nI am generally not a big fan of hardcore academic theory, but this collection of essays edited by Jeffrey Jerome Cohen gave me a steady stream of \"aha!\" moments when I first read it about twenty years ago.\n\nI struggled a bit with some of the jargon here, not to mention the fact that it only deals with monsters in the Western tradition, but I know of no better book for helping readers understand why humans create (and need) monsters, what roles monsters play in affirming (and undermining) social norms, and what the study of monsters can reveal about the anxieties and fault-lines in the cultures that spawn them. “Monsters are our children,” Cohen writes at one point: that still blows my mind after two decades of chewing on it.\n\nBy Jeffrey Jerome Cohen,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Monster Theory as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMonsters provide a key to understanding the culture that spawned them. So argues the essays in this wide-ranging collection that asks the question, what happens when critical theorists take the study of monsters seriously as a means of examining our culture? In viewing the monstrous body as metaphor for the cultural body, the contributors consider beasts, demons, freaks, and fiends as symbolic expressions of very real fears and desires, signs of cultural unease that pervade society and shape its collective behaviour. Through a sampling of monsters as a conceptual category, these essays argue that our fascination for the monstrous testifies…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Casebook of Victor Frankenstein\n\nBy Peter Ackroyd,\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nI picked up this book because it reminded me of a writing assignment I did in college. Instead of a traditional critical essay on Frankenstein, I wrote a “scene” in which Mary Shelley and Victor Frankenstein discussed the novel's themes. (I got a good grade if you are curious.) This isn’t the most lyrically written novel, but I loved the bold premise of bringing Victor into the real world to interact with the Villa Diodati group, telling them the unbelievable tale of his creation.\n\nI admired the clever turns throughout, and the climactic discovery was well-earned. I’ve always been a fan of the fictional character stepping off the page. This one had me thinking long after I’d finished it.\n\nBy Peter Ackroyd,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 14, 15, 16, and 17.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nVictor Frankenstein begins his anatomy experiments in a barn in the secluded village of Headington, near Oxford. The coroner's office provides the corpses he needs - but they have often died by violent means and are damaged and putrifying. Victor moves his coils and jars and electrical fluids to a deserted pottery manufactury in Limehouse. And, from Limehouse, makes contact with the Doomesday Men - the resurrectionists.\n\nVictor pays better than any hospital for the bodies of the very recently dead. Even so, perfect specimens are hard to come by... until that Thames-side dawn when Victor, waiting, wrapped in his…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Creature from Jekyll Island\n\nBy G. Edward Griffin,\n\nWhy did Mel love this book?\n\nI can’t say this about many books, but this one is life changing. Wonder about money? Where it comes from and why it makes the world go round?\n\nThe Creature from Jekyll Island is the landmark book about the Federal Reserve, banking, and finance. Originally published in 1994, this book is still routinely the number 1 best seller on Amazon for Economic Policy. The Creature from Jekyll Island not only opened my eyes to the reality of money in the modern world, it is also a thoroughly entertaining read.\n\nBy G. Edward Griffin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Creature from Jekyll Island as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve (Paperback) by G. Edward Griffin (Author) 2009\n\nPreview\n\nThe Lady and Her Monsters\n\nBy Roseanne Montillo,\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\nThis is such a fascinatingly researched book about the science during the time Mary Shelley created Frankenstein. I was surprised and enthralled to learn how many real-life Victor Frankensteins there were in Victorian England, all trying to be the first to reanimate a dead corpse. The accounts of grave robbery and, yes, even murder (The fresher the corpse, the better the experiment!) had me hooked throughout.\n\nAlso intriguing was how this macabre practice was deemed by many to be the cutting edge of science. I feel the theme is especially resonant today as we face our own life-creating hubris with Artificial Intelligence.\n\nBy Roseanne Montillo,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Lady and Her Monsters as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Lady and Her Monsters by Roseanne Motillo brings to life the fascinating times, startling science, and real-life horrors behind Mary Shelley’s gothic masterpiece, Frankenstein.\n\nMontillo recounts how—at the intersection of the Romantic Age and the Industrial Revolution—Shelley’s Victor Frankenstein was inspired by actual scientists of the period: curious and daring iconoclasts who were obsessed with the inner workings of the human body and how it might be reanimated after death.\n\nWith true-life tales of grave robbers, ghoulish experiments, and the ultimate in macabre research—human reanimation—The Lady and Her Monsters is a brilliant exploration of the creation of Frankenstein, Mary…\n\nPreview"
