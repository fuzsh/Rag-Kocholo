        "text": "I am currently a Deputy Dean for the Newcastle University Biosciences Institute (NUBI) with specific remit for Engagement and Place and Research Technical Professionals (RTPs).\n\nI am also the \"Innovation Methodology and Application\" (IMA) research Theme in the Faculty of Medical Sciences (FMS). This is a strategic role that aims to bring together technologists and methodologists from all job families in the faculty toward a true \"team science\", collaborative attitude to conducting cutting-edge research. The IMA will interface with the other 19 research Themes in the FMS and also be extremely outward focused with other faculties, HEIs and industry. I also serve on the Faculty Research and Innovation Committee (FRIC).\n\nIn my tertiary function, I am also director of the Newcastle Flow Cytometry Core Facility (FCCF), part of the Newcastle University Single Cell Unit (NUSCU). This is a world-renowned facility supporting cutting-edge research through the provision of a comprehensive cytomics resource to both internal and external groups, operating at the forefront of cytometric applications and method-focused research. As part of this role, my group have been developing, validating and applying both imaging and non-imaging cytometry-based methods to study several important aspects of cell biology and support various key research themes here at NU.\n\nHaving completed my PhD and subsequent post-doctoral work at the NIMR I have a strong grounding in basic and translational research and consistently contribute to high profile publications. I won the award for best paper in Cytometry part A in 2011 and also made key contributions to work published in Nature (2018 and 2019), Science (2012, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020) and Cell (2013). Furthermore, I present my method development work at key conferences both nationally and internationally as well as contributing to the presentations and abstracts of others.\n\nI am on the editorial board of the Cytometry Part A journal, specialising in imaging cytometry data and recently published some guidelines for data standards in the field. I was selected in 2014 by the International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) as one of only three individuals worldwide to be part of the Shared Resource Laboratory (SRL) emerging leadersâ€™ programme. This is a scholarship that recognises exceptional contribution to the worldwide cytometry community from those working in core facilities. I now serve on the ISAC council as member for technology and methodology. I am also a panel member for the UKRI-MRC Multi-user equipment call and the UKRI-BBSRC Transformative Research Technologies programme\n\nKey points and measures of esteem:\n\nThe first Research Technical Professional to be made Professor of Practice in the UK\n\nRecognised at an international level as an expert in the field of Cytometry and Core Facility operations.\n\nStrong publication record in high impact journals such as Science, Cell and Nature.\n\nInvited to speak at several national and international Cytometry meetings.\n\nMember of the Cytometry Part A editorial board..\n\nLead for the FMS IMA Theme, a first for a non-academic track staff member.\n\nMember of the various key funding agency panels\n\nAwarded the Royal Microscopical Medal (RMS) for Flow Cytometry research in 2019\n\nCo-chair of the UK Institute for Technical Skills and Strategy (UK-ITSS) Technical Council.\n\nCo-founder of the UK-ITSS Technology Specialist Network (TSN)\n\nConferences (highlights)\n\nGuest speak at the launch of the Liverpool University RTP promotion pathway.
