Dann's short story, ‘Marilyn,’ was adapted into an audio play, ‘Marilyn or the Monster.\"\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nJack Dann once told CA: ‘I remember being asked why I write science fiction—that was … back when I first began to publish. I answered by saying that science fiction gave me the most room to investigate/work out my ideas. I feel differently about that today. Indeed, I feel that science fiction can be very restricting. One can easily get lost in all the small details that have to be invented and lose the main thrust of the work, which might be why so many science fiction novels are still populated by cardboard characters. It's not that the authors don't care about characterization, but that they are overwhelmed by the details of their creation.\n\n\"Perhaps why I write science fiction can be inferred by how I write it. I first begin with a mood, a feeling, an idea or vision that I feel must be put to paper, lest it be lost forever…. For me, a novel is a series of such tiny explosions. The initial idea is a joy; anything is possible, and one can drop into that special place where daydreams and inventions and stories are made and play God. There are no limits in sight, but as we extrapolate the idea's possibilities, we come upon other ideas and must choose one course out of many. As one chooses, other possibilities are closed. As the idea takes form, attaches itself to other ideas and patterns … the initial joy must give way to critical thought. The mostly unconscious, intuitive processes must give way to the hard work of analysis.\"\n\nThe author added that this intuitive aspect ‘will only carry you so far—far enough to get you to the initial ideas, but as soon as you have the sense that you are about to find the pattern for the whole, everything falls apart, and you find yourself criticizing all your assumptions. Although this is a most frustrating time, it is when the work is initially forged into workable fiction rather than the daydream it had been. This critical time is agonizing for me, especially as it comes right on the heels of such growth and percolation. It's like waking up sober in the drunk-tank. I feel totally blocked, but I begin to ask questions.\"\n\nDann further observed that ‘sometimes, as working on [The Man Who Melted], I know the end, although it didn't become really clear until I had written some three hundred pages. The novel is my working to reach that end; that's the way I think of it, anyway…. In Junction I discovered the ending late in the process and had to rewrite previous portions as a consequence.\n\n\"As I see it, one way is as good as the other. I don't think the writer has any choice, anyway! Each idea, story, or novel must be dealt with in or on its own terms.\"\n\nDann later commented to CA: ‘I dreamed of being a writer when I was in high school, and I clearly remember thinking that once I became a writer, I'd be … rich, and I'd have a limousine and a driver. Ah, the delusions of youth.\n\n\"I almost died when I was in my twenties. I was in hospital and was given a five- percent chance of survival. The days and weeks and months were a series of stop-motion slides of agonizing pain and ice-blue Demerol dreams, pain, bliss, pain, bliss, and during the Demerol highs, I would ask my nurse for ice; I would place my hand in the ice and dream of ‘The Blue Country,’ a place of ice mountains and constant blue twilight, my own metaphor for lonely peace and death.\n\n\"After months of fighting for my life on a terminal ward where my friends died and the patients formed a secret club of those traversing the blue country, I began to recover. On my tray table beside the bed, I kept a copy of Ernest Hemingway's memoir of his youth in Paris, A Moveable Feast; and it became like a talisman for me. When I was too ill even to consider reading, I would put my hand on its cool covers … as if I could become a writer by osmosis. Later, I would read a passage or a page and enter Hemingway's life, what the French author Jean Dutourd called the life of art. I associated books with life, with the juice and joy of being alive, and I felt … that I had, in a sense, died and come back. I'd been given a second chance. And somehow that gave me the courage to take chances, live on the edge, live my dreams. I wasn't afraid of failure. For a while, I wasn't afraid of anything!\n\n\"Thirty years later and I'm still living the dream, writing, stretching, reaching for that elusive, perfect image, living fast and hard and hot, and sometimes—when I'm sitting in front of the cathode ray tube (‘CRT’) screen and reaching for those images—I'm not afraid of anything.\"\n\nDann ‘often ignores the loftier spiritual aspirations of humanity to descend again and again into the nightmare terrain of the subconscious,’ summarized Michael Bishop in his Washington Post Book World review of Timetipping. The collection, which includes four Nebula-nominated stories, ‘actually deliver[s] the goods,’ Bishop added, ‘albeit with a staccato, knife-edged prose and a purposely disorienting passion that corroborate [one writer's] avowal that Dann is a genuine original.’ As Gregory Feeley related in Twentieth-Century Science Fiction Writers, Dann's work is grounded in a central theme, developing ‘a recognizable figure in the solitary, obsessive young man whose disaffection with the stratified society he belongs to leads to a dramatic encounter with a larger strangeness that resonates in the telling with a powerful and sometimes disturbing resonance.\"\n\nOne such work is the Nebula finalist The Man Who Melted, which takes place in a postapocalypse twenty-first century where ‘Screamers’ wreak havoc in the streets, sweeping up onlookers in a great psychic riot. Raymond Mantle is searching for both his wife and his memory, for while his wife may have joined the Screamers, he is unsure whether she is dead or alive. While the surface of the story deals with Mantle's quest to find his wife, ‘what the book is ultimately about is the Apocalypse—what is unveiled are things that should be,’ observed Howard Waldrop in the Washington Post Book World. The critic explained: ‘The novel chronicles the loss of self in myriad ways—loss of loved ones, of individuality in a group, of memory, of selfhood.’ The novel is a ‘deeply felt, intense, finally cathartic book,’ concluded Waldrop. ‘It is Dann's best so far …. If other people don't know how good this is, I'll be mighty surprised.\"\n\nHigh Steel, written with Jack C. Haldeman II, is the story of John Stranger, a Native American living in a twenty-second-century future where the Earth is dominated by two corporations—Macro and Trans-United—which have, through some machination, managed to enslave America's native populations. Stranger is on the verge of becoming a medicine man when he is forced into leaving his reservation, conscripted by the ruthless Trans-United to work out past earth's atmosphere on an orbital construction project. His only alternative is to face one of the illegal ‘hibernation trials,’ whose outcome would result in John's conversion to a ‘Sleeper,’ confined and hidden from society. Building the high-tech orbital facility is extremely dangerous work, made even more so by occasional covert corporate warfare. Stranger raises the attention and suspicions of his corporate overlords and coworkers alike, when he continues to practice his tribal spiritualism. Thanks to Stranger's incredible ability to intuitively make correct decisions, he saves a Trans-United space station from an intended attack by Macro, becoming a hero to his fellow workers. His shamanistic visualization skills also bring the attention of Trans-United director Gerald Leighton who hopes to use Stranger to decipher a coded message broadcast to Earth, carrying the secret to building a drive capable of faster-than-light space travel. Native American myths intertwine in promising combinations with science fictional elements in Dann and Haldeman's narrative. Meanwhile, back home on the reservation, members of his tribe are experiencing visions that may be caused by the same aliens, and Leonard Broken-finger, John's former mentor, has, through the spirit world, contacted these same entities—thunder-beings who are able to invade humans' dreams. Stranger assists in building a space ship with the new, faster-than-light propulsion drive—a ship commanded by the artificial-intelligence genius Einstein. Through devious plotting, subversion, and assassination, Macro has seized control of Einstein, with Stranger still aboard the ship. Death and mayhem ensue, with Stranger's abilities the only stopgap to disaster.\n\nJohn Clute, reviewing the book in Interzone, wrote: ‘Everything [High Steel] attempts to accomplish is a remarkable success. What makes the book so intriguing, I think, is its authors' concentration on narrative. A musical analogy comes to view … Haldeman/Dann—like maybe Arnold Schoenberg in one of his later and more forgiving scores, though lacking of course his transformative originality—subjects the past to an intensive and non-reiterative scrutiny. In High Steel, as in Schoenberg, nothing is said more than once.’ Clute concluded: ‘[High Steel] is most highly recommended.’ Telluride Times-Journal reviewer John Nizalowski observed: ‘Haldeman and Dann take full advantage of their material's surreal potentials, while never losing sight of their goal—to tell a great story. The result is a powerful work, filled with rich imagery, spiritual mystery and tight plotting.’ Nizalowski continued: ‘The novel's cybernetic qualities evoke the Cyberpunk world of William Gibson. Yet the focus on Native American mysticism and the frequent use of stylistic experiments derive from science fiction's New Wave period, the 1960's movement which stretched sf's boundaries into true literature. This makes High Steel an interesting novel that is important to the evolution of science fiction itself.\"\n\nThe Memory Cathedral: A Secret History of Leonardo da Vinci, called ‘an elegant piece of historical revisionism,’ by Christopher Bantic in the Australian Book Review, combines a vivid historical portrayal of the famous Renaissance artist and inventor with an epic science fiction tale, set in an alternate universe. In the prologue, a dying da Vinci uses the title's mnemonic device/cathedral to locate and capture images from his past. In Florence, youthful visionaries Leonardo and Cristoforo Columbus share hashish, and he befriends a keen-witted and sexually precocious fourteen-year-old Niccolo Machiavelli, accompanying him in his wenching and indulgence in wild parties. Leonardo's father, hearing rumors of sodomy stemming from one such orgy, is outraged, and the repercussions serve to sever the familial relationship between the elder and younger da Vinci. It is from this falling out between father and son that the primary concept of Dann's novel takes its major leap of imagination. The novel postulates that, ‘between the cracks of known history,’ during 1482-86—a period that poses an intriguing blank in da Vinci's actual biography—he left home, and fell under the influence of a Middle-Eastern potentate, spending this period employed by the devatdar of Syria in building the marvelously advanced military devices now known only from sketches in his notebooks. As Dann posits the situation, the creation of such potent weapons of destruction, exercises in ingenuity that threaten to make warfare all the bloodier, poses a major moral dilemma for Leonardo, the genius whose imagination invented them.\n\nAdventures and misadventures that follow in rapid succession include a thrilling and dangerous hot-air balloon ride, perilous attempts to realize his dream of human flight, a pitched sea battle in the Adriatic, various other bloody conflicts, and torture dungeons replete with all the sadomasochistic accoutrements. Dann, who takes the ‘minority view’ that da Vinci was heterosexual, follows the artist-inventor through a series of wild sexual escapades. Tim Sullivan, writing in the Washington Post Book World, wrote: ‘Impeccably researched, The Memory Cathedral is a fine historical work about Leonardo da Vinci, as well as a science fiction story of epic proportions, mainly by virtue of its beautifully realized alternate universe…. Dann's prose is often striking in its color and period detail,’ and Sullivan concluded: ‘I recommend The Memory Cathedral to any serious reader of speculative or historical fiction.’ A Publishers Weekly critic deemed The Memory Cathedral ‘a highly imaginative reconstruction of the late 15th-century Florence and Persia … a novel remarkable for its recreation of the period and of its central figure.’ In a Booklist review, Roland Green found the story constructed of ‘well-researched and well-phrased pages that bring the world of the Renaissance Mediterranean vividly to life.’ Bantic also commented: ‘This is prose rich with sensual images and festooned with evocative observations. At times, so persuasive is the reconstruction of da Vinci's Florence, that one can be forgiven for imagining this is the writing of a Renaissance chronicler. We share what da Vinci experienced…. This is a fine historical novel which is as much a pleasure to the senses as it is to the intellect.\"\n\nThe Silent is told from the perspective of thirteen-year-old Virginian Edmund ‘Mundy’ McDowell, and is narrated in a rough-hewn, first-person Southern idiom reminiscent of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn. On March 23, 1862, in the second year of the Civil War, Mundy disobeys the prohibitions of his minister father and sneaks off from home to spy on one local skirmish in the bloody confrontation between the soldiers of the Blue and the Gray, hoping to see Stonewall Jackson put the hated Yankees to rout. This event is the precursor to his gruesome chronicle of tragedy and personal suffering. He returns home just in time to witness his family's house set aflame and his mother being raped, and both parents murdered, by Yankee marauders. In the wake of this trauma, Mundy is left not only unable to speak, but believing he is invisible. He interacts with the strange visitors who begin inhabiting the area around his now-devastated home, but refrains from conversing with them. He sets out on a tormented quest through a nightmarish, war-ravaged landscape, seeking an inner peace that constantly eludes him and may no longer even be attainable. He is aided along the way by various groups of Confederate soldiers and escaped slaves. Through his wanderings, the feverish borderline between reality and hellish fantasy is tenuous at best, constant illness and hunger further eroding his mental grasp of the world around him. Mundy believes that a black spirit-dog and the advice-giving ghost of a local slave named Jimmadasin accompany him in his travels. His ravished mind is constantly tormented by terrifying visions of sex, mutilation, and death, and, perversely, he discovers that his happiest moments are spent visiting battlefields, roaming the scenes of past slaughter. Dann, in character with much of his writings, including The Memory Cathedral, unflinchingly delves into the details of not only brutality, but of sexual awakenings, experimentation, and misadventure. Mundy's carnal degradations, although often mental and spiritual, involve the corporeal, as well. Young Mundy witnesses the horrifying operations performed by Sergeant-doctor Dunean in which soldiers' limbs are primitively amputated and then casually tossed aside. He sees friends killed, and wades through decomposing corpses. He falls victim to vicious homosexual rape at the hands of a predatory Yankee named Eurastus. He is initiated into heterosexual intercourse—and given a case of the clap—by Lucy, a worldly-wise teenage girl who regularly consorts with deserters and runaway slaves. And, finally, after witnessing an act of oral sex between a mapmaker and his wife, he finds his way into the bed of his hero, Colonel Ashby.\n\nJohn Clute wrote in the New York Review of Science Fiction: ‘In some ways, The Silent resembles Jerzy Kosinski's The Painted Bird (1965) …, which also features a young boy who has been driven mute by his experiences. But it's The Painted Bird as told by Huckleberry Finn. Mundy's narrative has the twist and muscle and flow (if little of the fun) of Twain's rendering of Finn's seriocomic spelunking into the Darklands of America; but Mundy's odyssey is into the dreamwork of hell…. Mundy is a picaro, Huck stripped bare. The Silent is a picaresque whose every word betrays a darkness at the end of the night. It has no doubleness at all. Goodbye to all that. It is utterly here: post-Finn.\"\n\nAndres Vaccari, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, agreed with Clute's comparison to The Painted Bird, and added: ‘A subdued moral outrage seeps into Dann's accounts of war, as if he was trying to make sense of the horror he describes and come to terms with the seemingly bottomless human capacity for destruction.’ He went on to say, ‘It is these elements, as well as the considerable power of Dann's storytelling, that raise The Silent above a mere exercise in world-building. In this book Dann has created an engaging and baroque realm, a place as enchanted as anything dreamed up by [J.R.R.] Tolkien, and as dark as a painting by [Hieronymus] Bosch.\"\n\nEric Robbins, in a Booklist review of The Silent, noted: ‘Like Mundy, Dann's story seems to wander aimlessly at times, but many will enjoy his unique perspective. Recommended.’ David Keymer, writing in Library Journal, termed The Silent a ‘fine novel,’ and added: ‘This is narrative storytelling at its best—so highly charged emotionally as to constitute a kind of poetry from hell. Most emphatically recommended.\"\n\nCharlie Sarris, one of the two main characters of Counting Coup, is an aging handyman with a family he struggles to support. He is an alcoholic, a depressive, and a veteran of World War II facing his mortality and the fact that his prospects are bleak. Then Charlie meets John Stone, a wandering Sioux medicine man who introduces him to Native American religion and culture. Fast friends, they indulge in a self-destructive spree of car thefts, robberies, heavy drinking, and dope smoking. John convinces Charlie to join him in a sweat lodge ceremony, where the shaman is spiritually confronted by an old enemy, Joseph Whiteshirt, whose enmity overflows as he begins a metaphysical pursuit of the two men. As Whiteshirt's influence bedevils John and Charlie throughout travels up and down the east coast, the afflicted duo attempt to find the evil shaman and break his powerful hold over them. ‘Dann has pulled off a very difficult task: he's made us care about people we don't necessarily like, understanding actions we don't agree with,’ remarked Charles de Lint in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. ‘He has combined earthy decadence and selfishness with high spirituality and leaves us with the uncomfortable thought that they might always be entwined.\"\n\nJubilee: The Essential Jack Dann contains a collection of seventeen stories spanning the highlights of Dann's lengthy career. The stories in this collection demonstrate the ‘virtuosity’ and wide-ranging abilities of one of science fiction's ‘most flexible and enduring writers,’ commented Library Journal reviewer Jackie Cassada. In a Booklist review, Roland Green concluded: ‘This is literary sf of the best sort.’ Visitations offers another collection of Dann stories extracted from twenty-five years of his literary output. Notable stories include ‘The Dybbuk Dolls’ and ‘Ting-a-Ling,’ as well as tales such as ‘The Glass Casket,’ a riff on Sleeping Beauty, and ‘Blind Eye,’ in which Dann imagines a much different Leonardo da Vinci from an alternate world. As an introduction to Dann and his work, observed Roland Green in another Booklist review, ‘this collection is remarkably valuable.\"\n\nThe Rebel: An Imagined Life of James Dean is an alternate history exploration of what might have occurred within the life and career of iconic rebel James Dean if he hadn't died in a violent car crash in 1955. In Dann's interpretation, Dean survives the crash and, while recuperating in the hospital, is visited by his mother's spirit, who advises him to ‘do something important and wonderful.’ Diverting himself from his career of Hollywood excess, Dean proceeds to do what his mother advised. He joins up with Bobby Kennedy to affect political change. He becomes a prominent director, creating movies starring a young Elvis Presley. Dean even has an affair with the generation's archetypal bombshell, Marilyn Monroe. Dean consorts with literary figures such as Jack Kerouac and entertainment stars such as Frank Sinatra. He also finds himself in a pivotal role in the movie Cool Hand Luke. When Dr. Martin Luther King is assassinated, Dean realizes that his celebrity should be used for higher purposes, and turns his efforts to political activism. ‘The anticipation of exactly what will be the apex of Dean's political career keeps the pages turning,’ observed Jerry Eberle in Booklist.\n\nDreaming Down-Under, edited by Dann and his wife, Janeen Webb, offers thirty-one stories, totaling more than 200,000 words, of original modern fiction by Australian writers. The editors also add more than 20, 000 words of introductions and expository material. A number of the stories in this well-heralded anthology are set in Australia, but others take place in the United States and elsewhere. Stories tackle what-if themes, provide reconsiderations of classic literature such as Shakespeare and Greek myth, and others occupy the borders between fantasy, horror, and magical realism. ‘Most attempt a look at deeper issues rather than skimming the surface of genre writing,’ commented Lesley S.J. Farmer in Kliatt. ‘This is a potent package, and even readers skeptical of all the hype won't be disappointed,’ observed a Publishers Weekly reviewer. Roland Green, in a Booklist review, commented that ‘the volume is a credit to its contributors, editors, and publishers alike.\"\n\nOccasionally, Dann steps out of the familiar science fiction genre and works with other styles. In Gathering the Bones, edited by Dann and horror icons Ramsey Campbell and Dennis Etchison, the editors present an anthology of contemporary horror stories assembled from both new and veteran writers representing Australia (edited by Dann), England (handled by Campbell), and the United States (stewarded by Etchison). In ‘The Hanged Man of Oz,’ by Steve Nagy, an additional cast member is discovered hanging among the sentient apple trees. Kim Newman's ‘Intervention,’ which a Kirkus Reviews contributor described as ‘truly brilliant,’ follows a bewildered and hapless man who one day arrives at his office only to be whisked away into an AA-like intervention, his connections to the world cut off, his family and friends consigning him to his fate. The reason is unknown to the terrified man, even as he is bundled naked into an ambulance and driven to his mysterious destination. ‘No Man's Land,’ by Chris Lawson and Simon Brown, explores the horrors of trench warfare and discovers how they can lead to even larger and more astonishing events. Other newcomers and notables, including Ray Bradbury, Tim Waggoner, and Gahan Wilson, contribute distinctive tales. A Publishers Weekly critic noted that ‘this book shows that distinctions of national origin and cultural difference dissolve in horror stories expertly cast from a crucible of quality.\"\n\nWith longtime collaborator Gardner Dozois, Dann edited Wizards: Magical Tales from the Masters of Modern Fantasy, published in the United Kingdom as Dark Alchemy: Magical Tales from Masters of Modern Fantasy, in 2007. The anthology combines eighteen original tales pertaining to wizardry from a number of published fantasy writers, including Neil Gaiman, Mary Rosenblum, Patricia A. McKillip, Nancy Kress, Terry Dowling, and Gene Wolfe. Reviews were positive for the collection. Cassada ‘recommended’ the anthology in a Library Journal article. A contributor to Publishers Weekly concluded: ‘Overall this magical brew will enchant young adult readers and their elders as well.\"\n\nMore recently, Dann told CA: ‘I always wanted to be a writer; and it seems that serendipity and good fortune have had a lot to do with determining the kind of writer I've become. When I was a child, my father used to keep his science fiction collection in my bedroom; and I literally grew up with science fiction and fantasy. Before I could even read, I would gaze, mesmerized, at the often beautiful and sometimes garish Doubleday Science Fiction book jackets by artists such as Hans Bok, Frank Kelly Freas, Frank Frazetta, and Chesley Bonestell; and then when I began reading and became a voracious reader—started reading all those books on my bookshelves. I still remember the first science fiction novel I ever read: The Green Man of Graypec by Festus Pragnall. It wasn't a very good novel by any standards, but I discovered in those pulpish pages the unique and enduring thrill of reading science fiction. And thus began my addiction to ‘sense of wonder.’\n\n\"When I was in university, I met two aspiring writers in an introductory astronomy class: George Zebrowski and Pamela Sargent. George was absolutely positive that he was going to become a science fiction writer, and I was fascinated by the idea that one could actually do such a thing, that one could teach oneself the craft of writing and then sell stories to publishers … for money!\n\n\"George and I started writing together, and we did, indeed, sell the stories we wrote together. We sent the first story to a fantasy magazine called Anubis. The editor accepted our story, but the magazine folded before it was published. (Years later, we sold it to Carol Serling's anthology, The Twilight Zone.) We sold our next two collaborations to Ejler Jakobsson, editor of Worlds of If, the sister magazine to Galaxy, a famous science fiction magazine in its time. George had taken the stories to a science fiction convention and handed them to Ejler directly. Against all the odds, the editor agreed to read them. (Warning: Don't try this on your own. Editors, including myself, hate it when newbie writers try to give them manuscripts at conventions or festivals.)\n\n\"I had a lucky start as a writer. However, as I began to send out my solo stories to various publishers, I began to collect my quota of rejection slips (as every writer must). But every time a story came back in the mail, I would send it out to another publisher the very next day. (I still follow that rule.) Eventually, I sold everything I wrote.\n\n\"Although I have always loved the tight, compressed, rigorous form of the short story, my short stories kept getting longer and longer. I found myself writing novellas and then novels. I suppose one could say that I became a novelist by default. I am very involved with the speculative fiction genre. I write and edit in the genres and continue to try to push the envelope to redefine what constitutes genre fiction. But I've been told more than once that I'm difficult to categorize because I write in and out of genre. You see, my father also kept his mainstream fiction collection on the bookshelves in my bedroom. To quote my old friend Harlan Ellison: ‘I'm a writer. Period.’\n\n\"I started making my bones as a writer in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was particularly influenced by the New Wave, a genre literary movement. The New Wave had a great impact on the SF and fantasy. It was a time when everything seemed to be opening up, political and social movements were changing the way we interacted with each other; it was a coming-of-age period in the U.S., and my generation was involved in the Civil Rights movement, the feminist movement, the antiwar movement, and on and on. During the New Wave, women became a central focus in the genre, and the claim could probably be made that they were doing the most interesting work—Alice Sheldon, Carol Emshwiller, Ursula K. Le Guin, Kit Reed, Pamela Sargent, Kate Wilhelm, Joanna Russ, Sonya Dorman.\n\n\"Literary experimentation became very important, and there was much wonderful work. I suppose it could be said that far too much of the experimentation was a reworking of what had already been done years before by writers such as Dos Passos. But at the top of its form, the New Wave was spectacular, and I am reminded of Ballard's compressed novels and Brian Aldiss at his most experimental. I was also interested in the broader literature, and, I remember, in the '70s that I was influenced by Decadent writers such as Huysman's (the influence can be seen in stories such as ‘Windows’) and the Expressionists. Salinger was an influence … my short story ‘Going Under,’ about the resinking of the Titanic—an adaptation from my novel The Man Who Melted—is a homage to Salinger's ‘To Esme with Love and Squalor.’ I would say that John Fowles was an influence, as well as Jorge Luis Borges, Jerzy Kosinski, Mark Twain, J.G. Ballard, Philip K. Dick, Gardner Dozois, Joe Haldeman, Brian Aldiss, William Kennedy, Henry Roth (author of the brilliant and little-known Some Call It Sleep), Edgar Pangborn, Theodore Sturgeon, and I could go on and on, but, mercifully, I won't.\n\n\"I try to start writing first thing in the morning, usually get foiled (the telephone and housework are the writers' enemies), then try again, and again, and again; and I keep trying throughout the day until I've got something workable. I enjoy having written … the actual writing is what's difficult. But I do it every day. To repeat the hackneyed phrase: ‘Writing is ten percent inspiration and ninety percent perspiration.’ But then there are those days when the hands fly over the keyboard, when the characters whisper in your ears, when you see it all clearly, and fiction writing becomes something like the spiritualists' automatic writing. I also seem to develop writer's block every few months. I consider it a normal part of the creative process. When I'm writing, I'm using up material; pouring it out, so to speak. When I get used up, I can't write. That's my cue to start putting back … to start reading voraciously, going to films, art museums, giving the subconscious a wallow. After a week or two, I'm ‘cooking’ again.\n\n\"For me writing has always been a way of being, a way of living, a way of seeing. I believe that any craft opens the creator to life, but it also narrows and focuses, and so I've taught myself to see as a writer. In a sense, I've become my craft. I think people admire artists and writers for their perceived freewheeling lifestyle and their presumed input into the culture. Most writers and artists live on the edge, often on the financial knife-edge, but I'm not talking about that … to spend a life in art, if that doesn't sound too pretentious, involves being willing to fail. I bet everything on every novel, put myself out there, back out on that proverbial edge. It was easier to do when I was in my twenties and thirties, when life felt like it would be eternal. It's more difficult now, but the buzz is greater. To live on the edge, to be willing to fail … what the hell; it can't get much better than that!\n\n\"I could be glib and tell an anecdote. Years ago I asked Leslie Fiedler what his favorite book was. He grimaced, indicating that was not a serious question. Of course, asking a writer what is his favorite book is different, especially if you're asking him to talk about his own work. A few years ago, I would have said that my favorite book is whatever I'm working on now. But I don't believe that … now. Every book feels puissant and powerful when you're working on it, when you're submerged in that world, living in your characters' skins. But some books feel ‘new,’ even after the years have passed. If I had to pick just one book, it would be my American Civil War novel The Silent. Although my Leonardo da Vinci novel, The Memory Cathedral, was far more popular, I favor The Silent, perhaps because it feels like a more perfect vision.\n\n\"I suppose the long and the short of it is that I want my characters—and places—to live, to become part of others' experience, as they have become part of mine. I guess we humble authors have rather florid God complexes.\"\n\nAUTOBIOGRAPHICAL ESSAY:\n\nJack Dann contributed the following updated autobiographical essay to CA:\n\nINSINUATIONS\n\nJULY 7, 2007: THE PRESENT OF THINGS FUTURE\n\nThis autobiography has become a collaboration, a collaboration with two vaguely familiar past selves who call themselves Jack Dann. They tried to live flat out and scoop up every jot and tittle of life's joys and experience; and, of course, they also managed to step, one clubfoot in front of the other, through the inevitable miasma of disappointment, loss, and grief.\n\nI began this autobiography in 1981, and it was published in shorter form in a magazine called Starship and a volume called Literary Masters, edited by Jeffrey M. Elliot. I was thirty-six years old, a young genre/literary Turk submerged in the writer's life, in the craft and culture and society of writers. I had been seduced by the idea of being a writer. I wanted to sit on the shoulders of giants, insinuate myself into the generational conversation of great literature, be remembered; and although I knew about death and the needle-sharp finiteness of life, although I had almost died, although I had lost friends and felt most of the adult emotions, life was still a great, tree-lined, winding highway with no discernable emotional end. And there was little separation between living and writing, being married and writing, being a parent and writing, being a son, brother, friend, or, in some cases, an enemy.\n\nI called the first incarnation of this autobiography ‘A Few Sparks in the Dark’ because that was—and is—how memories appear to me. My past has always seemed to be labyrinths of darkness broken only by incandescent flashes of memory, by neon fluorescences of events and dreamtime imaginings that have shaped and continue to shape me. And, yes, I've always had the niggling suspicion that I've also shaped and reshaped my memories to conform to those subtly shifting myths, stories, archetypes, epics, and fable that I've imagined to be my unique personal history. I create memory, and memory creates me (or me's) until it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to separate the truth from the … truth.\n\nIn 1993 I was asked to write an autobiography for the Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series, which I finished in 1994. I used the framework of the original\n\nautobiography and shortened the title to ‘Sparks in the Dark.’ I was forty-nine; and in my midlife summer, I had profoundly changed the course of my life. My old and dear friend George R.R. Martin used to refer to me as ‘the hermit of Binghamton’ because I was so rooted in upstate New York that I would rarely attend functions in such outré and faraway places as Manhattan or Los Angeles. I was—and am—an introvert, a loner, who has chronic feverish episodes of extroversion.\n\nYet in 1994 I found myself on the other side of the world.\n\nI finished ‘Sparks in the Dark’ in Australia and was also putting the finishing touches on The Memory Cathedral, my Leonardo da Vinci novel, which became my best-known work, the book that allowed an unsure, egocentric wannabe to call himself a bestselling writer. I had spent six years researching the Renaissance and the Middle Ages and had discovered Saint Augustine's ‘present of things past,’ ‘present of things present,’ and ‘present of things future.’ So I thought I would literally turn ‘A Few Sparks in the Dark’ into an autobiography told by two selves, for I had originally described remembered events in the present tense to try to capture that sense of ‘presentness’ that seems to characterize memory, as if all the events in deep memory have the same weight and valence and are somehow simultaneous. I wanted to tell the story of my life as … story.\n\nBut my forty-nine-year-old self imagined that he was in Augustine's present of things present and writing in the first-person past and present tense about August- ine's present of things past. That left my thirty-six-year-old self in the safe and secure present of things past. The sixty-two-year-old Jack Dann writing/speaking to you now is—from the perspective of his younger two selves who contributed to this story—caught in the present of things future. My two other selves left me in a bit of a quandary. How do I integrate their future memories into this autobiography and cue the reader as to which self is telling which story? My other selves dated some sections, while others were left to flow dreamlike, like memory itself.\n\nI think all I can do as a collaborator with the past is to insinuate myself once again into my own story, become a few more sparks in the dark simultaneity of memory. In this present of the future, I am writing in the guest bedroom of our little farm at the southern-most tip of Australia. When I pause to think and dream, I can gaze out the window at the Southern Ocean and the dinosaur shape called Wilson's Promontory. An eleven-month-old tricolor beagle called Bertie sleeps and dreams beagle-dreams beside me.\n\nPerhaps memory, like fiction, is a waking dream.\n\nIf so, it's good to be able to dream some of my story once again….\n\n*\n\nIt's September 10, 1993, and I'm in my office on Ackley Avenue in Johnson City, New York. I'm working in the family home, in the same room that was once my bedroom, and I gaze out the same windows where as a child I glimpsed the nighttime reflections of ghosts and twisted spirit faces. It's early afternoon, and the sun pours in, oak leaves move in green shadows against my neighbor's yellow house; and for this bright instant, I can almost believe that nothing has changed.\n\nYet everything has changed … everything has changed since I sat down in my old office on Main Street to write this autobiography twelve years ago … everything has changed in the last four months … yes, even in the last week.\n\nIn 1987 I moved into a pre-Civil War Greek Revival house with an acre of land and a pond, all in the city limits of Binghamton, New York. I moved with my\n\nwife and son. My son is now twenty-two and on his own. My wife is still in the house, but I am not. I've finally turned from the past. I expect to be out of the country by December. New love, new flowerings of possibility.\n\nLet the future call me a liar.\n\n*\n\nIt's March 29, 1994. Autumn in Australia. The trees in the park near my home in Melbourne are just beginning to turn to rose and that fall yellow I remember from so many autumns in Binghamton, when the leaves seemed to be turning into sunshine itself. But it also feels like summer; and as I sit in the garden, sipping tea, writing, and watching the goldfish in the pond feeding on the remains of my breakfast toast, I marvel at how I came to be here in the Antipodes, so far away from the familiar places I once loved.\n\nI type away on my laptop computer, writing this autobiography that has become as recursive as memory, that is still shifting wildly from past to present, to what Saint Augustine called the three times: the present of things past, the present of things present, and the present of things future.\n\nEven I have figured out that it's only a matter of perspective.\n\n*\n\nI've just sat down in a high-ceilinged, wood-paneled country church in Greene, New York. Cold winter light floods through stained glass windows depicting the tri-\n\nals and tribulations of Christ. The pastor blows into his hands and begins his memorial service for Jean Lindsley, a woman I've known for thirty-five years. Her husband, Joe, sits in the front pew, his long white hair gauzy in the light. Sitting beside my wife, Jeanne, in the pew ahead of me are Bob and Karen Van Kleeck, two of my dearest friends. I tap them on the shoulders to let them know I'm here, and then we're all standing, Karen loudly praying, for she knows the verses by heart. Suddenly, everyone is embracing. Bob leans over and hugs me, as does Karen. I kiss Karen, then take Jeanne's hand, squeezing it, and kiss her lightly on the cheek. Then Jeanne is sitting beside me, asking for tissues, and for all the world we look as we've always looked: two people who have kept hearth and home together for themselves and their friends. Now another friend has passed away, as if she had always been but a memory, a sweet, poignant metaphor for our marriage.\n\nThen we're all standing toe to heel in the obligatory receiving line in the church social room, which is fitted out with folding chairs and long tables covered with plastic table cloths. Platters of veggies and dip alternate with platters of ham and turkey; the smell of coffee permeates the room. I hug Joe's children, and then Joe and I embrace. I'm crying, crying for the loss of old friends, for all the sweet full memories we've had, for the poor times when we'd get together over bean stew and listen to jazz at Joe's box of a home in the country. ‘You're doing better with all of this than I am,’ I say to him.\n\nJoe pulls away and grins at me. ‘I've had more practice.\"\n\n*\n\nI haven't seen Joe. He went On the Road to sell his oils and watercolors in art shows and work out how he could live his life alone. I had once given him my copy of Jean Dutourd's Pluche, a book about an artist liv- ing the life of art … alone; little did I know that in his last years, Joe would, indeed, become Pluche. But he was supposed to be back in town before I left again for Australia. I was supposed to call him. We were going to have bean soup and listen to jazz for old time's sake. I was going to introduce him to Janeen Webb, my new partner.\n\nAs I sit in the jumbo jet, looking out the window into the flat darkness of sky and ocean, my knees pressed against the back of the seat in front of me, I can smell his stew.\n\nAnd I remember …\n\n*\n\nIt's 1969. I'm twenty-four and have sold two collaborative short stories to Ejler Jakobsson, editor of If Magazine; neither one has appeared yet. It is a warm, dry summer day, a wonderful day, full of sun and possibility. I am visiting Anne McCaffrey at her home in Sea Cliff, New York. She has a grand old Victorian house with a kitchen on the fourth floor and enough cats padding across the landings and up and down the stairs to satisfy even a cat lady. I've gotten lost in that house before.\n\nI'm sitting in Annie's tiny office on the first floor. Away from the noise. Paperbacks on narrowly spaced shelves cover the walls. The room is dark, almost mysterious, but secure. Anne sits behind her desk and looks at a row of books beside her. She stares hard at them, as if trying to think out the answer to a question. I imagine that if she finds the answer, she will never return to this tiny room again.\n\n\"These books are mine, Tawny Lion,’ she says to me. ‘It's as if every year is on this bookshelf. One day you'll be counting the years of your life by the number of books you've written. And that's what you end up with, a row of books, the years of your life.\"\n\nAlthough it's a magical time of my life—everything bright and compacted—Annie has just come through a bad marriage. She is a tall, large-boned woman with a shock of white hair. She's Irish and used to be an opera singer. She always seems to know when I'm in need of a home-cooked meal and some positive reinforcement. She is also the secretary of the Science Fiction Writers of America, an organization I've just joined.\n\nI'm living in Brooklyn, New York, and trying to write and go to St. John's Law School at the same time.\n\nI guess I'm in love with Anne McCaffrey.\n\n*\n\nIt's 1965 and I have a private room in Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. I'm connected to the bright, flat world of the hospital by plastic tubes—one breathes cold oxygen into my left nostril, another passes into my right nostril and down my throat into my stomach; one feeds me intravenously, another draws my urine. About fifteen student nurses are having a party in my room. It's my birthday. I've suffered a relapse, and my lung collapsed. I have acute peritonitis; none of the antibiotics I've been given seem to be working. Beside me on a moveable table is a philosophy textbook and a copy of Hemingway's A Moveable Feast. I put my hand on the books. I'm too sick to read, but I need them there. My nurse Rosie sits beside me and eats a piece of cake.\n\nI wish for another shot of Demerol. I cannot conceive of being without pain. Without the drug, it seems that there is nothing else. The drug represents cold and dream-hallucination, not surcease of pain.\n\nThe books. I promise myself that if I survive this, I will do something worthwhile. Perhaps become a nurse; too late for me to become a doctor. I make a deal with God, even though I do not believe in Him. If I live, I promise Him, I'll do something with my life, take chances. I pat the books beside me.\n\nThree weeks before, I had been in coma. My temperature had been one hundred and four degrees for some time.\n\nRight now I think of ice hills and blue music and moveable feasts.\n\n*\n\nI'm riding in the back seat of a rented yellow car in the winter of 1978. The countryside is covered with new snow; the road is slippery. We're somewhere between Binghamton and Greene, New York, on our way to visit Joe Lindsley and his wife, Jean, who are waiting for us in a redneck bar where they feature country rock bands.\n\nOne of my dearest friends is driving the car. This is the first time we've seen each other in seven or eight years. The government has just given him a new name and identity. There's a lot of blood under our bridges. We were going to be artists together. We were going to become engineers and found a company called SEA—Submerged Experiments in Agriculture. That was in high school. We even had an engineer working with us. But we went our own ways, and finally found each other again.\n\nI'm having trouble calling him by his new name, which he insists upon. We talk about Joe, who is a framer and used to work in a frame shop on Main Street in Binghamton. When we were fifteen and used to come into the shop to buy art supplies, he would talk to us for hours about painting, literature, current events, philosophy, whatever he was interested in at the time. He always had stacks of books in the back room, books on painting technique, books containing drawings and paintings by old masters, history books, and, of course, modern and classical literature. He especially loved science fiction. Most of his books he borrowed from the library. But everything was new to us. What the structured school system had tried to extinguish, or at least divert, Joe rekindled every week.\n\nMy friend has a new wife, who is beautiful and has a mane of thick red hair. I nickname her The Lion.\n\nThere is a lot of laughter and fast-talking in this car. Trying catch up on two lives in a few hours. My friend puts his arm over the back of his seat, looks at me in the rear-view mirror, and says, ‘Jackie, do you remember when we were in high school and one day instead of going home we went walking around Clinton Street? We were walking across the bridge and you said you were going to be a writer. You just knew that. Nothing was going to stop you. And you walked along, swinging your arms, saying over and over, ‘I'm a writer, I'm a writer, I'm a writer.’\"\n\nSurprised, I say, ‘No.’ I try to remember, but it's all gone.\n\n*\n\nIt's February 4, 1981, and I'm in my office on Main Street in Johnson City, the same Main Street that runs through Binghamton where Joe Lindsley worked as a framer and where he later opened his own shop. I sit here trying to construct—or reconstruct, I should say—my past.\n\nAnne McCaffrey was right. As I look through my stories and books, I can remember writing each one. They're the pegs upon which hangs my past. These books are my memory.\n\n*\n\nIt's March 29, 1994, and my books, papers, files, photographs are unavailable to me now, for I've left them all behind. As I look at the pages I wrote thirteen years ago, I realize that memories are small bright fictions, approximations of reality filtered through the various lenses of experience. It's all basically true, I tell myself, but the filter of experience changes, twists, and creates so many truths out of the original remembrance. In 1981 I was a writer. Now I just write. Being a writer doesn't seem very important. The work, the process, is important.\n\nBut so is chewing up every moment as if I were nineteen … so is living for and in the moment. This is the moment. There's not enough time left to be complacent. It's taken me twenty years to learn to put words on paper, only to discover that I've got to begin all over again. I had an idea for a novel about a writer who misses out on his life because he's always involved in a book or a project. His children grow up before he has time to notice. And when he does, it's all gone; the years turn his life to paper.\n\nThat's the straight line extrapolation of this writer's life from the perspective of February 4, 1981. And it's mostly true.\n\nBut it didn't quite work out that way….\n\n*\n\nWhen I was in the hospital for a four-month period, I had such a high fever that I developed a mild amnesia. My memory has holes in it. It's as if that time in the hospital was so intense that it burned entire areas of my memory and lit others with an almost numinous light. Indeed, I feel like Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim, snapping back and forth in time from one incident to another. That's the visceral sense I have of it, anyway.\n\nThat night when I went to Greene with my friend was one of discovery. My friend talked, probed, and suddenly I found myself remembering. The memories came back to me with the strength of hallucination. Like Billy Pilgrim, I went back and forth in time as if dreaming reality. And even now I keep discovering, remembering, as the overpowering intensity of my time in the hospital begins to wane just a bit.\n\nBut even with a perfectly clear memory, I would have to sneak up on my past, take note when a familiar sight or smell jogs loose an old memory. My past must be constantly snared; it would be a hunt, even without the burns of amnesia.\n\nSo now I'll begin in the conventional way. What follows was written in February, 1981 … before everything had changed.\n\nI was born in 1945 in Johnson City, New York, about two blocks away from my present office. Although I've spent quite a bit of time away from this area, it has always been my home; and I returned for the kinds of emotional layering and correspondences that I find only here. It is as if there is a corresponding map of Johnson City and Binghamton in my mind, only this map is one of space and time—a grid, so to speak. I remember this same building where I now have my office as it was when I was a child—the building hasn't changed, but as I have, I see it differently now. And yet I have that visceral sensation that the other ‘me's’ caught in those beads of time that I perceive as the past, are still here. And I remember, or rather see, the world as I saw it then. In a way, it's like living in an excavation, and one's life becomes an archaeological dig.\n\nIn the course of a day, I pass by old buildings where I used to live and places where I used to play. I see ghosts everywhere as I pass back and forth through the years, and many of those ghosts are myself. I remember walking up and down Main Street with Gardner Dozois, one of my closest friends, and experience once again that sensation of compacted experience, of being alive in an open-ended way: the time of the twenties when, as Harlan Ellison might say, we live at the top of our lungs.\n\nJohnson City is a sleepy town that lies between Binghamton and Endicott on the northern side of the Susquehanna River. Taken together, the populations of ‘The Triple Cities’ are almost as large as that of Syracuse, our northern neighbor. It is located in a valley, which has almost constant cloud cover, and lies in the midst of some of the most beautiful country I've ever seen. I'm in love with this little piece of the world, as can be attested by the alien scenarios of my novel Starhiker, many of which are really descriptions or exaggerations of upstate New York countryside.\n\nI feel a strong sympathy for the way Andrew Wyeth painted Kuerner's farm in Pennsylvania for twenty years, going back to the same place over and over again, and always finding the new in the old, a world in microcosm. That is somewhat the way I feel about the whole Binghamton area, and upstate New York in general. Ray Lafferty once wrote that certain parts of the country, the old lands, have ghosts, the layering of generations. (He wrote this as fiction, of course, and as memory isn't strong on this, I may be garbling what he wrote.)\n\nFor me, this land has its ghosts and layerings.\n\nAnd I find it amusing and ironic that at the time when I was asked to write this autobiography, my work was changing shape, as I've discovered my home to be my ‘Kuerner's.\"\n\nBut this work is really for the future, which holds a novel, already begun, entitled Counting Coup.\n\n*\n\nOf course, it was another ‘me,’ caught in a bead of time perceived as the present, who wrote that. Like me, he was blind to all but the past. He would not have been surprised to discover that Binghamton would continue to inform and give form to his work in such stories as ‘Fairy Tale,’ ‘Playing the Game’ (with Gardner Dozois), ‘Slow Dancing with Jesus’ (with Gardner Dozois), ‘A Cold Day in the Mesozoic,’ ‘Reunion,’ ‘Bad Medicine,’ ‘Tattoos,’ ‘The Apotheosis of Isaac Rosen’ (with Jeanne Van Buren Dann), ‘Visitors,’ ‘Blues and the Abstract Truth’ (with Barry N. Malzberg), ‘Kaddish,’ ‘Voices,’ and ‘The Extra.\"\n\nHe finished his contemporary novel Counting Coup and sold it for a rather large advance for the time to Bluejay Books, which then went out of business. The advance went toward the down payment on the Cutler House, a three-story Greek Revival where he would live and work for five years. But all that has been seen of that work are the excerpts ‘Bad Medicine,’ which was a Nebula finalist, and ‘Counting Coup,’ published in an anthology about American Indians entitled Tales From the Great Turtle. As one New York editor said, Counting Coup has become an unpublished underground classic.\n\nBeing blind to the future is most certainly a blessing.\n\nFrom the perspective of years and the distance of some 9,000 miles, I see the person who began this autobiography thirteen years ago in an entirely different light. He was trapped in his own version of Kuerner's farm, and if his life had not exploded, if he had not been thrown out of it, as if from a cannon, he would still be there now living in the very small and very secure spaces of his own construction. But when he wrote that, life was determinate rather than synchronistic; he could plan and extrapolate, and find things amusing and ironic. He could afford to be smug.\n\nHis father had not died.\n\nHe had not yet lost so many friends to cancer.\n\nHe had not fallen in love.\n\nHe had not felt enough pain.\n\nHe had not yet discovered how to live in the moment.\n\nAnd he didn't know that the compacted times, the times of being most alive, were ahead of him.\n\n*\n\nIt's October, 1988, and I'm standing in my father's private room in Lourdes Hospital in Binghamton. I stand beside my mother, and we stare dumbly at my father, who has passed away only minutes ago. He died quickly, in my mother's arms, of an aneurysm. Images pass through my mind as I look at my father, who seems to be merely asleep, oblivious to my mother's soft, choking cries. And I remember when nurses wheeled him toward me on a stretcher years earlier. He had just had surgery for a melanoma and looked like a corpse. Yet he was mumbling something, chanting it over and over. I leaned toward him to hear ‘They can't kill Murray Dann … they can't kill Murray Dann.\"\n\nI remember when he had discovered that one of his lungs had to be removed. He called from Florida and insisted that I fly down and drive him north to Binghamton. I told him that he needed surgery as soon as possible and should fly home. He refused, and so I caught a plane into summer, and drove him from Florida to Binghamton. We talked of last things, of guilt and mistakes, and I absolved him as best I could, told him that no one deserves to carry such guilt, that that was absolution itself.\n\nAnd we drove eighty-five miles an hour up I-95 in his big gold Lincoln with the windows open and the airconditioning turned to high. We talked and drank from his hip flask that was in the shape of a demon and flew towards the darkness together.\n\nImages projected on my dead father lying in his hospital bed. My mother leaves me alone with him, and I pace back and forth across the room, talking, trying to squeeze it all in, even though he's dead, even though he can't hear. But I can't stop talking. All the words left unsaid. Now said in the cotton silence of that room. Now I can leave him, but when I reach the waiting room, Mother insists on taking a last look. I go back with her, lest she be alone with the dead, and there I discover something about the nature of the soul, for now I see only a dead, plastic form, empty.\n\nMy father had left.\n\n*\n\nThe story ‘Voices,’ published in the August, 1991, issue of Omni Magazine, was born out of that experience.\n\n*\n\nMy father was an attorney. He married his childhood sweetheart, worked in a bank, and studied law at night at St. John's Law School located on Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn—I was to study law at the same school, with the same teachers. After passing the Bar, he moved to Johnson City and bought the white, hacienda-style stucco house I grew up in. My mother lives there now. It is full of the ghosts of better times.\n\nI grew up with science fiction books, as my father was an avid reader and kept his science fiction collection in my bedroom. I used to look at the lurid covers and dream about them before I was old enough to read them. I can still remember the Hannes Bok cover of the first science fiction book I ever read: The Green Man of Graypec by Festus Pragnell. As a child, I stayed to myself. My books became my closest friends.\n\nI went to public school until I was fourteen. I did my share of fighting, as I was one of the few Jews in the area. The fighting prepared me for the military school I was to attend for two years. With the exception of art classes, I found school boring and began to get into trouble with school authorities and finally the police. My parents suggested a private school, and I jumped at the chance for supposed freedom. I chose a military school because their promotional booklet looked glamorous, containing photographs of young men skiing, playing war, wearing uniforms with swords, and dancing with pretty young ladies in grand ballrooms.\n\nThe slogan of The Manlius Military Academy, located just outside of Syracuse, New York, was ‘Manners maketh Man.’ I never did discover the logic of that, but it was the school code. Manlius was supposed to be the stepping-stone school for West Point, which was probably true, as many private schools have special relations with particular colleges. Manlius boasted that its varsity football team played the West Point frosh, which we did, every year—an excuse to take a bus ride and smoke all the cigarettes our lungs could stand.\n\nLike West Point, Manlius was at that time a strong hazing school, and was really two worlds. We were, of course, regulated by adults, our instructors and military people. We went to classes, did ROTC every day, went to church in formation like penguins on Sunday, and dutifully wrote our parents. That was the apparent world. But the hour-by-hour life of the new student, the newboy, was controlled by older students. In truth, children ruled a world of children, and being children, punishment for an infraction was severe.\n\n*\n\nMy roommates Crocker and Palomar are taking a smoke in the woods by the old water tower. I'd like a cigarette right now, but I've got to wait in the hall and make sure no one goes into the lavatory, which is catercorner to my room.\n\nOne of the newboys is getting a GI shower; I can imagine how he's being scrubbed from head to foot with wire brushes and lye soap. But I can hardly hear the screaming over the radio noise. My radio. It's playing ‘Duke of Earl,’ my favorite song. My face is still bleeding from a pimple I had to cut with a razor blade. I remind myself to call Mom and Dad tonight.\n\nIt's Sunday afternoon, and A Company dormitory is almost deserted.\n\nThen with a ‘halloo,’ they drag the newboy out of the john. He's not screaming or fighting, just whimpering. But Jesus Christ he's bleeding everywhere but from his balls. The other guys are all excited. They're laughing and dancing around. One is even stupid enough to be carrying a wire brush into the hallway. And another one has a hard-on.\n\nI duck back into my room, and everyone else gets out of the hall. Sergeant Wells Morton, who has a room across the hall from mine, hasn't seen or heard a thing. He's been working on an overdue paper. I know that newboy is still out there, but all I can do is imagine him standing in the hall, bleeding like a pig.\n\nWell, he should have taken a goddamned bath once in a while.\n\n*\n\nThe school is closed now. I went back for a look some years ago, went back in the middle of winter when the snow drifts were four feet deep. The red brick buildings seemed to be rising out of nowhere, as if seen in a dream, and once again slipping back, I saw myself marching again, as if inside the snow, and a fistful of those beads of time played before me. And I remembered. I cried with nostalgia—nostalgia for a time and a place I had hated. Now it had been suddenly transformed into ‘the good times,’ but only when I wasn't snapping back and forth, only when I could look through the past with thirty-five- year-old eyes.\n\nI returned to Manlius because I had (and still have) a novel in mind about the school. An old school chum had told me that the school had been closed because of a homosexual murder. If, indeed, what he said was true, I knew one of the professors involved.\n\nAnd I remember a time when the entire football team was kicked out of school a week before graduation because of a homosexual incident. I can still remember the excitement shuddering through the various company dormitories.\n\nI leaf through my old yearbooks and find photographs of myself standing with the other boys of my company. Once again I discover that those are photographs of little boys, and yet I remember a world that was very different from anything the eye of a camera could see.\n\nThe world I remember was something like Salinger's Catcher in the Rye; in fact, the campus he describes was very much like that of Manlius. But that world was also like the movie If, or Lord of the Flies, which I read after getting out of the hospital in 1965.\n\nI remember those times as being hard-edged and cold as a GI shower.\n\nI'm working on a novel entitled Extra Duty. It's about that boy who stood in the hall while the newboy was being roughed-up in the shower. Only this time he witnesses a homosexual murder.\n\n*\n\nAnd now I'm forty-nine, rereading old material written in earnest; and separating the truth from the fiction. Extra Duty was a white lie, for I wasn't working on that novel, except to think about it once in a while. But I had learned from my friend and collaborator George Zebrowski how to fool myself into being a writer from one week to the next. George has often acted as my own personal Dale Carnegie, although in these hard days of the 1990s, we have often reversed those roles.\n\nSo I thought about a novel entitled Extra Duty and stuffed it right into my biography as work-in-progress. There, another book. You are making progress, Jack.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't be so hard on my old self, as thinking about a story is really only a hair's-breath away from producing it. Easy to write this now, as I sit here in the sun in Melbourne with a fax beside me that came in at 4:00 a.m. I just sold a new novel about the Civil War, entitled The Silent, to my editor at Bantam Books for more money than I would have dreamed possible in the early days.\n\nAs I think about it, The Silent owes much to my Manlius experience. And, who knows, Extra Duty may yet be written. George called me last night to tell me he had worked out a plot for a novella cobbled out of an outline for an old novel of mine, titled The Mindcasters.\n\nAfter all, writers resurrect the dead as a matter of course.\n\n*\n\nLike Salinger's protagonist, I kept running away from school and was finally taken out by my parents. I was offered officer's rank and the run of the school if I would stay because the school was using me as an example of what they could do with a boy. When I entered Manlius, I failed four courses. When I left, I was on high honor role.\n\nI came back to Johnson City, but went to school in the next town, where I had some friends I had met at Manlius. It was at Binghamton Central High School that I met the man mentioned in the early flashback. He tried to overdose on aspirins, of all things, and then we lost touch. Later, Joe Lindsley told me he was importing wild animals into this country for zoos.\n\nBut I'm jumping ahead, for Joe told me that when I was in college.\n\nTruth be told, almost all of that high school time is lost to me. Perhaps it will come back.\n\n*\n\nWhen I try to remember, as I'm doing now in 1994, I'm reminded of skin-diving in the lakes in upstate New York where visibility at best is around five feet.\n\nEverything is gauzy, hazy, lit in a nimbus. I hold my breath and dive to about fifty feet, as the blood pulses in my head and the gray, gauzy water world becomes even more two-dimensional, And there, in the flat, constricting haze, I encounter the unpredictable: a silvery school of fish suddenly reflecting and refracting all over me like aluminum shards inside the polished tube of a kaleidoscope. For that instant, I'm overwhelmed, but only for an instant, for I need oxygen more than anything else.\n\n*\n\nI remember attending my thirtieth high school reunion at the IBM Country Club on a hill in Endicott, New York. I remember the expansive rooms and buffet, the corkboards covered with yearbook photographs, the balloons and streamers, and vaguely familiar middle-aged strangers laughing and shouting and embracing, as if trying to crawl back into the discarded snakeskins of their adolescence. The men are balding … the women wide and puffy and lacquered. I remember shaking hands and wondering who these people are who seem to know me so well.\n\nA man and a woman stand before me, drinks in hand, both dressed casually; old hippies just going to seed. But obviously successful. ‘Hey, Jack, we came down from L.A. just for this. We wanted to see what had happened to you. So you did become a writer. Well, you crazy sonovabitch, you certainly influenced us in the early days.\"\n\nI smile and nod and cannot for the life of me remember who they are.\n\nSilvery fish swimming around me in the gauzy light.\n\nFeeling pressure in my lungs for oxygen, I excuse myself.\n\n*\n\nI'm at a party in the convention suite of a science fiction convention. I can't remember the year or the city, for all convention parties seem the same, as if time has collapsed in between them, leaving one continuous party in which the participants only become older.\n\nI'm sitting on the floor with Lucius Shepard, James Patrick Kelly, John Kessel, and Gardner Dozois. We're all fairly drunk, and Jim looks at Gardner and me and says, ‘I was reading you when I was in high school. I wanted to be like you guys … you were always out there, on the barricades, right in front. You held on to your integrity.\"\n\nHow could he have been reading me in high school? He can't be much younger than me … can he? And John agrees with him. Indeed, we were right out there, doing our thing, snubbing our noses at being ‘commercial,’ starving our stupid asses off. But we'd kept our integrity.\n\nIndeed….\n\nAt the mention of ‘integrity,’ Lucius begins pouring beer into my empty shoes.\n\nSuch is the reward of holding out for integrity on the barricades of science fiction.\n\n*\n\nI went to Hofstra College in 1964 for two reasons: I was interested in becoming an actor, and Hofstra had a good reputation; and at that time Hofstra had no dormitories. After Manlius, I had sworn I would never live in a dorm again.\n\nWhen I was taking my entrance examinations in 1963 at Hofstra, which is located in Hempstead, Long Island, I heard someone in the large room shout my name. I turned around to see my friend Charlie Kochis taking the same examination. Charlie and I had gone to Manlius together, had been best of friends.\n\nCharlie phoned my mother who, when she found out that I was staying in a ward in a welfare hospital, took me to a private hospital in Oyster Bay, Long Island. She had the best intentions. But neither of us knew that the hospital was unaccredited, had no access to a blood bank, and was involved in illegal abortions for the rich. Some years after I left, the hospital was closed by the state.\n\nI had a beautiful room overlooking the ocean. I remember a cross hanging on the white wall opposite the window. I was operated on, a routine operation, and then everything became like a dream. My stomach was full, I was in agony. My private nurse, a man who had once been a professional boxer, told my parents that they'd best get me out of this hospital. He felt I would probably be left to die. My parents called Dr. Ed Rem, an old family friend, who examined me and ordered an ambulance immediately.\n\nI spent four months in Norwalk Hospital on a terminal floor, where I watched my friends die, one by one. I saw the best and the worst of people, met with death, and saw myself reflected in the flames, saw myself as I really was—and have been trying to change ever since.\n\nPatients on a terminal floor live in a world unto themselves. They have their own ways of communication, their own ways of coping and helping each other. The nurses and doctors and families that walked in and out of our rooms lived in another world. They never saw us as we were, as we saw ourselves. In the microcosm of a terminal floor some of the patients play out the last of their lives heroically, just as others beg and plead and whimper.\n\nI remember a man in the room across the hall from me. He cried and screamed day and night, trying to make deals with God and the angels, begging for another chance. He was in agony, and nothing seemed to help him. He had lost most of his stomach because of ulcers. I remember my own pain, and I remember hating that voice across the hall, wishing it to cease. I imagined that the man was a baby, an ancient babe, and I wished it dead.\n\nLater, after the man died or left the floor, I wanted another chance to feel right about him. In the hot logic of my fever dreams, he had died because I had wished him dead, because I thought wrong thoughts.\n\nAnd I understood that that whimpering thing was me, and that I won't allow myself to forget.\n\nI couldn't integrate those experiences into my fiction until 1977 when I wrote ‘Camps,’ which appeared in the May, 1979, issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It is a story about a dying boy in a hospital who has recurring dreams that he is in a concentration camp. His nurse, who had been one of the first women to enter the camps at the end of the Second World War, discovers that his dreams are real. He is dreaming about the camp she had entered, and his life in the present, in the hospital, depends on a past known only to his nurse. She must guide him through the past. And now, as I write this, I understand why my protagonist, Stephen, flashes back and forth through time, from hospital to concentration camp. Those sections that take place in the hospital are based on my own experiences. Some are exaggerated, of course, and others didn't happen. But I was Stephen, hooked into machines, dreaming Demerol dreams of ice fields and blue hells.\n\nAnd yes, again for an instant, I'm still Stephen.\n\n*\n\nIt's disconcerting to look back on one's work and see that, indeed, it is of a piece. Much of my work is about the nature of time and the waking to consciousness, and there is a sequence of short stories that seek to ‘testify’ to the fact of the Holocaust that begins with ‘Camps.’ Gardner Dozois and I wrote a story, entitled ‘Down among the Dead Men,’ which raised hackles among critics and writers alike. It was about an inmate in the camps who was a vampire. Other stories followed: ‘Tea,’ ‘Kaddish,’ and the science fiction novelette ‘Jumping the Road,’ which was the cover story for the October, 1992, issue of Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. The themes of time, consciousness, memory, the camps, and hospitals recur in my work like the objects of worship floating just below the surface of the ocean in my story ‘Kaddish.’ My story ‘Visitors,’ which first appeared in the October, 1987, issue of Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine was about a dying boy whose hospital room becomes crowded with the ghosts of dead patients.\n\n*\n\nMy nurse's name was Rosie, and she was twenty years my senior. I remember sitting on a bed with her in a motel room filled with family and friends. I had just left the hospital, and we were celebrating. And I remember how I felt when they wheeled me out of the hospital, remember crying at the sight of sky and trees and children, at the sound of cars and crickets. In tears I demanded to drive, and I drove that long black Cadillac as if I wished to be back in the hospital again.\n\nI felt I had to squeeze life, as if to death.\n\nRosie and I sat on the bed while everyone else drank and talked. We cried and held each other. She had gotten too involved, had slipped into the world of the patient, and I had caught her. We knew each other intimately, as well as lovers (although the most we had ever done was to hold hands), knew each other as well as parents can know children, as friends can know friends.\n\nShe would always look the other way when I was naked.\n\nI was in love with Rosie, still am. Right now I remember her coming into my room at 6:00 a.m. and knocking something or another to the floor to announce her arrival. I remember….\n\nI received a letter from Rosie several months after I left Connecticut. She told me that one of my closest friends, a patient, had died. He was an engineer and had a lovely wife and mistress who would visit me on alternate days, just as they visited him. He was in his late forties, had white hair—as white as Annie's—and he had a particularly painful form of cancer.\n\nOne night, just about the time when he would walk over to my room for a hand of pinochle, I heard a crash in the hall. Rosie came back with the news: he had been given enough sedatives to put a horse to sleep, yet he tried to walk to my room. By rights, she said, he shouldn't have been able to move. I knew why he did it: he didn't want me to think that anything was wrong.\n\nI remember a policeman down the hall whom I never saw. He had been shot several times. He had five kids. Every night he sent his nurse over to find out how I was doing. We talked to each other through our nurses, sent messages back and forth every night, and as I had relapses and recovered and was delirious, I imagined that I was talking with him and his family. He died, and the nurse closed all the doors, as they always did.\n\nAnd we all knew him, even though no one ever saw him.\n\nWe also knew the man who had swallowed four quarts of motor oil and was six hours on the dialysis machine.\n\nWe knew him, we knew them all.\n\n*\n\nI never heard from Rose after that. I wrote her one letter, but she never replied. I think about her every week or so. It is becoming easier to think about that time.\n\n*\n\nI'm standing in Barry Malzberg's living room. The walls are covered with books. Two couches and a coffee table seem to fill up the room. Across the room and to my right are the glass doors of Barry's office.\n\nIt is 1975 and summer. Barry and George Zebrowski and I have just driven back from New Jersey, where we attended a dreadful party at Roger Elwood's home. Half of the people at the party were writers and half were members of his church. We rode up and back in Barry's Cadillac. The party was so uncomfortable that Barry and I kept sneaking out to the car to nip at a bottle of bourbon that he kept in the glove compartment for just such emergencies.\n\nGeorge, who is in another room talking to Joyce, Barry's wife, has been quite optimistic all day. He and Barry have been arguing about the fate of science fiction, the growing book market, and hard cover vs. paperback books. George has been telling Barry that he, Barry, has hurt his career because of his approach to the field, because of his pessimism. Barry became angry and left the room, then returned, only to pace.\n\nNow he is standing beside me. He is well over six feet tall and is dressed in a white shirt with a tab collar, the kind worn during the sixties that pushed out the knot of the necktie. He is wearing a black tie and jacket; he has not fastened the little tabs under the tie. He seems to loom beside me, a great black bird.\n\n\"You think you're like George,’ he whispers, as if George is in the room and might hear. ‘You think that by being diligent and producing a body of good work it will somehow work out.’ He pauses to fit a cigarette into a holder, and I wonder if the pause is for effect. ‘You wait and see, you'll feel differently. There's too much darkness in you, you won't be able to delude yourself much longer. You'll see, you're like me.\"\n\nI nod and feel the man's power, his unique charisma. It's as if the darkness he spoke of, which he represents, has become suddenly palpable. Yet I can see a row of his books across the room.\n\nHe has succeeded. How can he feel he's a failure?\n\n*\n\nSuch questions, questions that would be absolutely obvious to anyone but a writer, had to wait nineteen years for an answer. It's not the number of books or the quality of the work. It's about having a life.\n\nIt's far too easy to forget that there is life other than printed words and deadlines and conventions and awards, and far greater failures than bad books, or books that don't sell. And I'm embarrassed to admit that it took so long for me to figure that out.\n\nI think the expression is ‘Get a life.\"\n\n*\n\nI returned home from the hospital in the late summer of 1965. I had become institutionalized, in that when it was time for me to leave the hospital, I wanted to stay. In fact, I managed to stay with Rosie an extra few weeks by feigning illness.\n\nI remember an old acquaintance who had spent most of his life in jail. He used to talk about prison as if it were a social club. He knew he was going back; he was only out for a while.\n\nI understand that now, just as I understand Barry….\n\n*\n\nI still had the drainage tubes in my abdomen, and they remained in place for another month. I could not face going back to school, could not face any responsibility, but finally I became bored and entered SUNY at Binghamton. It was there, in my senior year, that I met George Zebrowski and Pam Sargent. I met them in an astronomy class.\n\nThe year was 1967. Later that year I met Josiane Mueller, who was Pamela's roommate. I remember going to that apartment. Pam was in the living room, sitting at a table and working on a philosophy paper. Her boyfriend George lived in the apartment below, I believe (memory suddenly becomes clouded), and he walked into the apartment while Josiane was getting ready for our date. George, who is about five foot five inches tall with long blond hair and a square, boyish face, immediately told me that he was a science fiction writer. He spoke very well and was dressed more like a professor than a student—in those days denim was the student's uniform.\n\nGeorge seemed to know everything about everything. He took me over to his apartment and showed me his stereo system, upon which he played only classical music. Although he had not yet been published, except in amateur fan magazines, he began talking about what it took to be a writer. Then he showed me a fanzine that he had published.\n\nWe discussed reviving his magazine, and suddenly I knew I was going to become a writer. If George could be a writer, so could I. In the next few months, I spent almost all my time with George. He would read to me for hours from books about writing. George loved to teach, and I listened to everything he had to read. It didn't matter that George was almost as green as I was about the craft of fiction. He knew where to look to find things out, and he believed so strongly in himself, that I did, too.\n\nAnd then we were writing. Every night we would sit across from each other at his living room table and type. It was a wonderful, novel time. Everything seemed possible. I was reading everything put before me. I was a sponge, as malleable as I've ever been—and I hope will ever be—in my life. Everything seemed new to me—philosophy, science, literature.\n\nI did the first drafts for several stories. George then reworked, plotted, and did the clean draft. I'll admit that my memory is not clear about much of that time, but I remember that the idea of writing, of working with words, seemed magical to me. When I was a child, I thought that characters in books awakened when you opened the book and went back to sleep when you closed it. But they were real. And some of that stayed with me then. I felt that for the first time I was dipping into the stuff of life, and like a boy coming into puberty, I was quite overwhelmed by what seemed to be happening inside me.\n\nAlthough George always assumed the role of teacher, I began to teach myself to write. I remember memorizing whole passages from Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman and Kosinski's The Painted Bird. I tried to make their very words and rhythms my own.\n\nOf course, I could not write—or do what I considered to be writing. The stories I wrote with George were finished (a major accomplishment for any writer), and he sold two of our earliest stories by giving them to an editor at a science fiction convention.\n\nBut I did not feel like a writer. I could not even begin to express my thoughts and sensations on paper. Everything I wrote seemed amateurish, which, of course, it was. But I was determined to learn the craft, and craft became everything. I thought only of learning how to write, how to make the words correspond to my thoughts. I began to listen and learned how to speak properly. Everything became form, everything was thought of as craft of fiction.\n\nI graduated from college in 1967 with a B.A., although I didn't receive my diploma until 1968. I did not attend the ceremonies; I felt removed from the whole college experience. I had made few friends, and have, regretfully, lost touch with those years, except for writing.\n\nGeorge and Pam became my family. But I was immature and still emotionally weakened from my time in the hospital. I let myself slide into the role of child, and George and Pam became surrogate parents.\n\nI was to regret that slide later, although as I think about it now, I realize there was nothing any of us could have done. I feel that that ‘me’ was very different from the man I am now, although, quite frankly, I can't help but like that past self. He was a mongrel, an amusing puppy. But I also realize he had quite the potential to turn into a dangerous animal (which some might argue he had!).\n\n*\n\nI just received a fax from Pam Sargent. My connections to business and old friends are now fax, e-mail, and telephone. Although I don't have any real sense that I'm living on the other side of the world, most of my friends feel those 9,000 miles that separate us.\n\nGeorge called yesterday, and I had to keep reminding him that he was spending seventy cents a minute to schmooze. But he told me it didn't matter, much, as he'd just gotten off the phone with Arthur Clarke, who lives in Sri Lanka. He'd already run up the phone bill. What was a few more dollars? George, Pam, and I had made it through the long years of silence, but we are more like family than friends; and now, once again, we keep each other safe, for the 1990s are both the best and the worst of times.\n\nI guess I just had to grow up.\n\nOr grow old….\n\n*\n\nInsinuating myself back into my story, my life.\n\nMy old selves certainly understood the value of perspective and reflection, but in 1994, I had no real concept of growing old; old age was just some demarcation sign I'd approach on that wide winding highway. Growing old was what everyone did … eventually; but not me, not yet. I was still in the thick of it.\n\nBut surely, some things had changed.\n\nI remember walking down some sun-lit street in Binghamton, New York with my stepson Jody, remember watching three pretty young women approaching us, smiling, sending out those ancient sexual igneous rays from their wide and clear eyes, those rays of thrumming, electrical, telepathic connection that so often used to vibrate through me. The ancients believed that the eyes were the windows of the soul; those ‘come hither’ looks were certainly (or at least certainly metaphorically) powered and propelled by that ancient, frangible energy. As those young women approached us, I suddenly realized that I couldn't feel the energy, couldn't feel the connection … and those definite come hither looks were being directed by those beautiful ray gun eyes at Jody, not at his middle-aged stepfather. Ah, epiphany.\n\nNow at sixty-two, feeling young yet wondering why my father's aging face keeps staring balefully at me in the morning mirror, I try to take it in stride when lovely and lonely gray-haired old ladies of approximately my age or older smile as they pass me by on the streets of Melbourne or on the main street of my village near the sea.\n\nI can still remember that thrilling, constant sexual thrumming of youth, those concentrated rays, those windows of the soul; but they've now become soft noises and faint reflections … for the most part.\n\nAge does present some few, albeit juvenile compensations.\n\nI can get away with playing with my dream-images, becoming an aging James Dean when those blue-haired ladies smile and giggle, wearing sunglasses at dusk, shirt collars turned up for warmth and 1950s cool, enjoying the bitter-sweet cocaine sensation of being the oldest kid in the neighborhood. What other people think becomes about as important as wearing gumboots or engineer boots when digging in the garden.\n\nYet I can remember when it all changed, when one world set like an autumn sun and another world revealed itself.\n\nDusk, a languid Australian summer night in 2005.\n\nI'm sitting in Norm and Paddy Broberg's huge, high-ceilinged living room that overlooks Wilson's Promontory and the cold dark waters of Bass Strait. The room is filled with rows of folding chairs and movement: people taking their seats, greeting neighbors, the pleasant susurration and buzz of chitchat, the familiar faces of retirees I see occasionally in town or at the markets. A Steinway grand piano has been moved to center stage, so to speak. Norm's filigreed pots—produced with an alchemy of craft deserving of inclusion in Ripley's Believe It or Not—line shelves and cabinets, and paintings lure the eye away from the magnificent views of hillock and water framed in another wall … of glass. Norm is a potter and painter; Paddy is a musician. And this room—right down to the acoustics—was built for concerts.\n\nPaddy tells us to please be seated and introduces a young, award-winning classical pianist. She then graciously steps away so the callow-looking young man can explain what he is going to play. My wife, Janeen, sits beside me. I can smell the sandwiches in the formal dining room behind me. People shift in their chairs, someone nods to me; I hear the water steaming in the kitchen.\n\nThe pianist plays … brilliantly.\n\nMinutes pass into a liquid sort of timelessness, and I'm reminded of lucid dreaming, one of my tools for working out difficult plot problems. Rhythm, music is tidal, it inhales, exhales. Breathing deeply, regularly, music in, music out until a trilling of keys, sharp and crisp, breaks my reverie; and I realize with a cold, numbing shock—as if I've been thrown overboard into some Antarctic sea—that almost everyone here is … old.\n\nNot old to my present self when he is in thinking, rational mode; but old to those restless other selves that continue to inhabit his psyche.\n\nHere is a sea of gray, a winter of white. Here are wrinkles and lines and the ever-sharpening marks of crows' feet. And as my thoughts stream and steam, I'm suddenly caught in some comically cruel stream-of-consciousness passage of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or Henry Roth's Call It Sleep.\n\nI'm old, we're all old, they're retired, gray, don't trust anyone over thirty, prostatitis, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, ingrown toenails, diarrhea, cholesterol, hernias, arthritis, Dad died of an aneurysm, Mom died of cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, and the concert is over, the pianist is bowing and I'm hungry, thinking of those sandwiches. Janeen touches my hand. Red hair frames her beautiful, regal face.\n\nKnowing, tilted green eyes.\n\nAnd I quickly pass through one world into another.\n\nRevelation, fear, mortality fade away into the stinging sounds of clapping hands and the impatient rustling of clothing. I look at Janeen and smile, gloating. I may be gray, a silvery shadow of my old selves, but I sure as hell know how to rob the cradle.\n\n*\n\nGeorge called yesterday.\n\nHe and Pam have been going through my old papers that are stored in their cellar. They wish I were there. Just like old times. Except he and Pam now have a large, book-filled home in Albany, New York. Binghamton is now mostly a construction of memory; when I go back home in real time, I find a city where I have to use the GPS navigation system on my rental car to get from one almost familiar place to another.\n\nGeorge, ever blessedly didactic, talks on and on, politics, books, and philosophy. He is st"
