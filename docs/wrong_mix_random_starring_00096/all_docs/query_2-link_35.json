But now you’re ready to do more than just watch: you want to produce your own work for the screen.\n\nThe Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Filmmaking encourages and equips students to realize their artistic and career visions through observation, imagination, storytelling, and technical skills. Courses in directing, editing, cinematography, screenwriting and production prepare you to produce imaginative, professional, critically appreciated narrative, documentary, and experimental films.\n\nFilmmaking embraces everything involving the moving image, including documentary and fictional blockbuster hits, cutting edge television, visionary independent films and edgy experimental work. As a Filmmaking BFA major, you will be encouraged to develop your personal vision and creative voice by producing works in various genres, culminating in your industry calling card: the senior year thesis film project. From your first day here, you will learn, practice and develop the skills that will prepare you for success in a rapidly growing industry.\n\nFilmmaking is about telling stories. And, visual storytelling is at the foundation of the BFA in Filmmaking at Montclair State University. Our intensive conservatory style progression of course work gives our filmmaking majors a powerful foundation in the concepts of story. We know that everyone involved in the filmmaking process, be it the producer, director, cinematographer, production designer, gaffer, to the editor, must have a solid grasp of how to convey a powerful story.\n\nThe Filmmaking BFA at Montclair State is supported by a liberal arts and humanities curriculum that will develop your critical thinking skills and foster a global perspective for determining filmmaking subject matter. Courses in communication and media arts will prepare you for success in an evolving industry. To enhance career options after graduation, we intentionally correspond our course content to the needs of the filmmaking industry by hiring working professionals to teach courses and by offering practice-oriented seminars, the Film Institute at Montclair State screening and speaker series, and internships throughout the world. Our proximity to New York City – just 12 miles away by train – means students have opportunities to visit working film and television sets, as well as studios and post production houses.\n\nWhat You Will Study\n\nAs a Filmmaking major, you will learn about the art of the moving image through introductory and advanced level courses that teach film history, screenwriting, directing, production, sound recording, cinematography and film editing. Our intensive conservatory style program means that freshman begin making films their very first semester and continue to sharpen and refine their skills by producing original films every year. Senior-year students develop thesis level projects culminating in an ‘industry calling card’ ready film. Coursework on the film business focuses the financing, marketing, and distribution of films so students are equipped to enter the industry. Small classes are taught by a faculty of professional filmmakers and artists who are skilled in up-to-the moment filmmaking practices and provide instruction on cutting edge industry-standard equipment and software. You will also have access to invaluable experiences through internship and cooperative education opportunities.\n\nExplore the Filmmaking BFA curriculum.\n\nWhat Our Students Create\n\nAward-winning short film CATALINA:\n\nPaul (2017)\n\nBehind the scenes footage of student projects:\n\nVERIFY\n\nTHE GREATS\n\nREACH\n\nRINDIE\n\nFacilities\n\nThe School of Communication and Media houses state-of-the-art, fully equipped production studios including a facility used exclusively for filmmaking.
