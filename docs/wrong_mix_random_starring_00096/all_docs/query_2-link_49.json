        "text": "Preliminary Lists of Top Baby Names in Rhode Island in 2023\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is sharing preliminary lists of the most popular baby names in Rhode Island in 2023.\n\nFemale\n\n1. Charlotte\n\n2. Sophia\n\n3. Olivia\n\n4. Amelia\n\n5. Emma\n\n6. Nora\n\n7. Luna\n\n8. Isabella\n\n9. Mia\n\n10. Isla\n\nMale\n\n1. Noah\n\n2. Liam\n\n3. James\n\n4. Theodore\n\n5. Lucas\n\n6. Michael\n\n7. Julian\n\n8. Benjamin\n\n9. Henry\n\n10. Luca\n\nIn 2022, the three most popular female names were Charlotte, Amelia, and Isabella. The three most popular male names in 2022 were Liam, Noah, and Owen.\n\nRIDOH's Center for Vital Records finalizes the prior year's birth data by the end of February.\n\nGovernor McKee Highlights 2023 Rhode Island Department of Health Accomplishments: Promoting Healthy Lifestyle, Ensuring Safe Food and Drinking Water, Preventing Chronic Disease\n\nIn a year full of public health successes, the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) put interventions in place throughout the State in 2023 to promote healthy lifestyle changes, ensure the safety of food and drinking water, promote emergency preparedness, perform infectious disease and chronic disease prevention and control, and promote maternal and child health, to name only a few focus areas.\n\n\"A healthier Rhode Island is a more resilient, prosperous, and equitable Rhode Island. This belief is driving our administration and the team at RIDOH to make critical public health services available in every city and town throughout the state,\" said Governor Dan McKee. \"RIDOH's achievements over the last 12 months run the gamut from community-centered chronic disease prevention work to interventions that are preventing overdoses and saving lives. The team at RIDOH has a lot of momentum headed into 2024, and I'm looking forward to supporting their great work.\"\n\n\"While the expertise of RIDOH was on full display throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we work every day – often behind the scenes – to make Rhode Island a healthier place to live, work, and play,\" said Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH, Interim Director of Health. \"We do this with a specific commitment to health equity, and to ensuring that every Rhode Islander has an equal opportunity to be healthy and thrive. We are proud of all we did during 2023 and look forward to another year of collaboration with our partners to promote health and wellbeing throughout Rhode Island in 2024.\"\n\nSpecific examples of RIDOH's successes in 2023 include:\n\nRhode Island continued to be a national leader in adolescent immunizations. Rhode Island teens were at or above the national average for every recommended vaccine type. For example, Rhode Island has the nation's highest rate for 13 to 17-year-olds who are up to date on their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. For Tdap vaccination (protecting against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), 95.1% of Rhode Islanders 13-17 years old have had at least one dose, compared to 89.9% of adolescents in this age group nationally.\n\nSubstantial construction happened on the site of the new Life Sciences Hub in Providence's Innovation and Design District. This site will include a new, 80,000-square-foot State Health Laboratory, as well as life science laboratories for Brown University and additional bio-technology space. The new facility is expected to be ready for occupancy in 2025.\n\nRIDOH coordinated the testing of drinking water from public water systems in Rhode Island for a group of harmful chemicals called per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) [r20.rs6.net [r20.rs6.net]]. In addition to doing public education on these emerging contaminants, RIDOH is partnering with public water systems that exceeded a new Rhode Island PFAS threshold on corrective actions. RIDOH has also launched a program for testing drinking water in Rhode Island public schools for lead.\n\nAs part of efforts to prevent overdoses and save lives, RIDOH activated an enhanced system to track non-fatal overdoses throughout the State daily and to get text message alerts out into the community in real-time. These alerts go to first responders and other healthcare professionals, harm reduction organizations, local leaders, and residents in impacted areas. Using this data system, mobile outreach teams deploy peers with lived experience to overdose hotspots each week to connect at-risk populations to treatment, recovery, and harm-reduction services.\n\nTo address the growing need for behavioral healthcare, RIDOH initiated the application and supported the process to have Rhode Island added to the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT). Psychologists in any of the other PSYPACT states can now apply to provide telepsychology services to patients in Rhode Island. (And Rhode Island psychologists in the program can provide these services to patients in other states.)\n\nWithin hours of being notified of a case of meningococcal meningitis, a serious and sometimes fatal illness, RIDOH organized a clinic to make doses of post-exposure prophylaxis medication available to this person's immediate contacts. Getting this medication to contacts is critical to preventing severe illness, particularly for at-risk populations. Almost 80% of the patient's approximately 100 close contacts received this post-exposure prophylaxis medication, an exceptional acceptance rate. This response was a collaboration between RIDOH's Center for Acute Infectious Disease Epidemiology, RIDOH's Center for Emergency Preparedness and Response, and many other teams throughout the Department.\n\nRIDOH took swift regulatory action requiring the out-of-state owner of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to do more to support these two Rhode Island hospitals. An Immediate Compliance Order was issued to the owner, Prospect Medical Holdings and its corporate parents, after a thorough, extensive review by RIDOH's Center for Health Facilities Regulation and monitoring by RIDOH's Office of Health Systems Development.\n\nRhode Island is one of only a few states in the nation that does not have local health departments providing services and shaping public health policy at the local level. This makes the scope of RIDOH extremely broad, and results in close partnerships between RIDOH and healthcare professionals, healthcare facilities, community partners, schools, and local, state, and federal offices, among others.\n\nRIDOH's various functions and programs are organized in the following units:\n\n- Division of Community Health and Equity\n\n- Division of Emergency Preparedness and Infectious Disease\n\n- Division of Environmental Health\n\n- Health Equity Institute\n\n- Division of Healthcare Quality and Safety\n\n- Division of Policy, Information and Communications\n\n- Office of Policy, Planning, and Strategy\n\n- Division of State Laboratories\n\n- Office of Workforce Development and Engagement\n\nRIDOH and DEM Recommend Lifting Restrictions for Blue-green Algae\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) recommend lifting the recreational advisories at Waterman Reservoir in Glocester/Greenville, Little Pond in Warwick, Blackamore Pond in Cranston, and Indian Lake in South Kingstown. The recreational advisories were associated with high levels of blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria. Almy Pond in Newport, Roger Williams Park Ponds in Providence, J.L. Curran Upper Reservoir, Spectacle Pond, and Mashapaug Pond in Cranston remain under advisory due to continued visual evidence of blue-green algae.\n\nBlue-green algae are generally less active as seasonal changes reduce light and temperature in the winter. However, the possibility of recurring blooms and/or toxins represent potential risks, even in iced-over conditions.\n\nDEM monitoring has ended for the year. Regardless of season, the public is reminded to avoid contact with any body of water that is bright green or has a dense, floating scum. Blue-green algae blooms may look like green paint or thick pea soup.\n\nFor more information and a list of historical advisories, visit http://www.dem.ri.gov/bluegreen. DEM still encourages the public to send reports of suspected blue-green algae blooms, along with photographs, if possible, to DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov.\n\nQuaker Recalls Granola Bars and Granola Cereals Due to Possible Health Risk\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that the Quaker Oats Company is recalling specific granola bars and granola cereals because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella.\n\nMost of the granola bars were sold as Quaker Big Chewy Bars. Recalled granola bars were included in many snack boxes.\n\nSalmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy people infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses, such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis.\n\nTo date, Quaker has received no confirmed reports of illness related to the products covered by this recall.\n\nRIDOH and RIAG Deem The Centurion Foundation HCA Application Complete\n\nToday, Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) Interim Director Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha, the two State regulators empowered to oversee hospital conversions in Rhode Island, notified the parties involved in the proposed hospital conversions of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in a letter (attached) that their application has been deemed complete to initiate formal review.\n\nThe two hospitals are operated by CharterCARE, which is currently owned by Prospect Medical Holdings. The proposed transaction would sell the CharterCARE hospital system to The Centurion Foundation, a Georgia-based non-profit company.\n\nThe Attorney General and RIDOH will now have 180 days to review the application under the Hospital Conversions Act (HCA), before issuing their respective decisions. Consistent with the standard process set forth by statute, the Attorney General's Office will make the application public in mid-January after completing a full review to protect confidential information of the transacting parties, in accordance with the provisions of the HCA. The review process will also include public comment meetings and hearings.\n\nUnder the HCA, transacting parties seeking the transfer of ownership of a hospital must first complete an Initial Application which is filed with the Office of the Attorney General and the RIDOH. Following review of the submission from Prospect Medical Holdings and The Centurion Foundation, the Attorney General and RIDOH determined that the submitted materials contain sufficient information necessary for the State to initiate its review under the HCA.\n\nAmbulances Recommended for Pregnant People in the East Bay / Se recomienda el uso del servicio de ambulancias para personas embarazadas que viven en East Bay\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is recommending that ambulances be used by pregnant people in the East Bay who are in labor and who, after consulting with their healthcare professional, need to get to a medical facility west of the Washington Bridge immediately. The Washington Bridge carries 195 between East Providence and Providence. People can contact an ambulance by calling 911.\n\nThis recommendation is being made because of current traffic disruptions on the Washington Bridge. Currently, emergency vehicles (including ambulances) can travel westbound on the bridge. Personal vehicles are not currently permitted to travel westbound on the Washington Bridge.\n\nRIDOH will provide additional updates as traffic patterns over the bridge change.\n\nEl Departamento de Salud de Rhode Island (RIDOH por sus siglas en inglés) recomienda que las personas embarazadas que viven en East Bay utilicen el servicio de ambulancias cuando estén en trabajo de parto y que, después de consultar con su profesional de atención médica, necesiten llegar inmediatamente a un centro médico al oeste del Puente Washington. El Puente de Washington es el tránsito de la interestatal 195 entre East Providence y Providence. Las personas pueden comunicarse para el servicio de ambulancias llamando al 911.\n\nEsta recomendación se hace debido a las actuales interrupciones del tráfico en el Puente de Washington. Actualmente, los vehículos de emergencia (incluidas las ambulancias) pueden transitar por el Puente de Washington en dirección oeste pero no se permite el tránsito en dirección oeste de los vehículos personales.\n\nRIDOH proporcionará actualizaciones adicionales a medida que cambien las recomendaciones de tráfico sobre el puente.\n\nRhode Islanders Urged to Get Vaccinated Before Seasonal Travel and Gatherings\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is reminding anyone who will be traveling for the holidays or plans to attend holiday gatherings to get vaccinated now against common respiratory viruses. Large gatherings, crowded travel, and more time indoors can mean more viruses spreading this time of year.\n\nEveryone older than six months of age should get a flu shot every year. The 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine is also recommended for everyone older than six months of age. It can take up to two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop and provide people with protection against viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Vaccination is particularly important for older adults and people with underlying health issues, including weakened immune systems, diabetes, obesity, asthma, cancer, and heart or lung disease.\n\n\"Holiday cheer is in the air. Unfortunately, so are respiratory viruses,\" said Interim Director of Health Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH. \"If you plan to see people for New Year's or attend a holiday party with family, friends, or colleagues this month, now is the best time to get vaccinated, if you have not been vaccinated already. In addition, if you are sick, stay home to avoid putting others at risk. This is particularly true if you were planning to see any older adults or people with underlying health issues.\"\n\nFlu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine are available throughout Rhode Island at pharmacies, the offices of many primary care providers, and community health centers. These vaccines are also available at community clinics. These clinics are being held in the late afternoon and evening at schools and are open to the entire community. To register, go to http://covid.ri.gov/vaccination and click \"Community Clinic Registration.\" People can register for either COVID-19 vaccine (available at these clinics for people ages 5 and older), flu vaccine (available at these clinics for people ages 3 and older), or both vaccines. It is safe to receive both vaccines at the same visit. There is no insurance requirement and no cost for vaccination. People can get the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine even if they have not received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past.\n\n?\n\nIn addition to flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine, many people are eligible for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, including pregnant people, infants under eight months, eligible children 8-19 months at increased risk, and many people 60 and older. Talk to your healthcare provider about RSV vaccination if you are in one of these groups.\n\n?\n\nAdditional information about preventing respiratory viruses?\n\n-- Stay home when you are sick. Stay home for at least 24 hours after a fever is gone. Temperature should be measured without the use of fever-reducing medicines (medicines that contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen). Avoid contact with others, especially older adults and people with underlying health conditions, if you are sick.??\n\n-- Wash your hands regularly throughout the day using soap for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands.?Hand washing is especially important after touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; after leaving a public place; after touching objects or surfaces that may be frequently touched, such as door handles, light switches, and tables.??\n\n-- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands. Always wash your hands as soon as you can after you cough or sneeze.?\n\n-- Get tested for COVID-19 if you have any of the classic symptoms, like fever or chills, a runny nose, a cough, achiness, or loss of taste or smell. If you or someone you live with tests positive for COVID-19, there are steps you can take to prevent spreading the virus to others and protect yourself from getting very sick. The Isolation Calculator can help you determine how long you should stay home and isolate away from others. Learn more about doctor-recommended treatments for COVID-19 that can keep you from getting sicker and being hospitalized.\n\nFor additional information about preventing respiratory viruses can be found at: http://health.ri.gov/respiratoryviruses\n\nChicken Fried Rice Products Recalled\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Garland Ventures is recalling 13,842 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken fried rice products that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nThe chicken fried rice products were produced on November 10, 2023. Specifically, the product is in 12-oz. trays containing Freshness Guaranteed brand \"CHICKEN FRIED RICE DICED CHICKEN MEAT WITH VEGETABLES AND RICE IN A SAVORY SOY SAUCE\" with lot code WK10CFR and a best if used by date of 11/10/2024 on the label. The products subject to recall bear the establishment number \"EST. P-31993\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.\n\nThere have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare professional.\n\nConsumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection primarily affecting older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. People in higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell a healthcare professional about eating the contaminated food.\n\nConsumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.\n\nRIDOH and DEM Recommend Lifting Restrictions for Blue-green Algae in Tiogue Lake\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) recommend lifting the advisory restricting recreational activities at Tiogue Lake in Coventry.\n\nThe advisory related to high levels of blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria. Recent consecutive surveys confirmed that there was no visual evidence of a bloom. These findings meet the advisory guidelines and support lifting the advisory.\n\nBlue-green algae conditions can change quickly, and it is possible that blooms may affect Tiogue Lake again or other waterbodies in Rhode Island. The public should avoid contact with any body of water that is bright green or has a dense, floating algal mat on the water's surface. Blue-green algae blooms may look like green paint or thick pea soup. Toxins may persist in the water after a blue-green algae bloom is no longer visible. To report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact RIDEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov\n\nRIDOH and DEM Recommend Lifting Restrictions for Blue-Green Algae in Melville Ponds and Carbuncle Pond\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) recommend lifting the advisory restricting recreational activities at Upper and Lower Melville Ponds in Portsmouth and Carbuncle Pond in Coventry. The advisories were related to high levels of blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria.\n\nRecent consecutive surveys confirmed that blue-green algae have been present but at acceptably low levels and that cyanotoxin is not present in detectable concentrations. These findings meet the advisory guidelines and support lifting the advisory.\n\nBlue-green algae conditions can change quickly, and it is possible that blooms may affect other water bodies in Rhode Island. The public should avoid contact with any body of water that is bright green or has a dense, floating algal mat on the water's surface. Blue-green algae blooms may look like green paint or thick pea soup. Toxins may persist in the water after a blue-green algae bloom is no longer visible.\n\nTo report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact RIDEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov\n\n###\n\nNurse Assist Recalling Saline and Sterile Water Medical Products\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers, healthcare professionals, and healthcare facilities that Nurse Assist is recalling certain saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and sterile water medical products due to the potential for a lack of sterility assurance. The products may not be sterile.\n\nNurse Assist is recalling:\n\n- 0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP (100 mL bottles, 250 mL bottles, 500 mL bottles, 1000 mL bottles, 3.1oz spray can, 7.1oz spray can, 3mL syringes, 5mL syringes, and 10mL syringes);\n\n- Sterile Water for Irrigation USP (100 mL bottles, 250 mL bottles, 500 mL bottles, 1000 mL bottles, 120 mL cups, 10mL syringes, and 30mL syringes).\n\nThese products were sold under the following brands: Nurse Assist, Cardinal, Covidien, Halyard Owens Minor, Idexx, Mac Medical, McKesson, Medichoice Owens Minor, Medline, Sol, SteriCare, Trudell, and Vyaire. The recalled products may be available as individual units or may be included as part of a kit.\n\nAdditional product information is available online (see link below).\n\nBlue-Green Algae Bloom at Indian Lake\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) are advising people to avoid contact with Indian Lake in South Kingstown due to blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) blooms in the ponds.\n\nBlue-green algae can produce toxins that can harm humans and animals. Toxins and/or high cell counts have been detected in the lake by the RIDOH State Health Laboratories from water samples collected by the DEM. All recreation, including swimming, fishing, boating, and kayaking, should be avoided. People should not ingest water or eat fish from the pond. Pets can also be affected by exposure to the algal toxins and thus owners should not allow pets to drink or swim in the water. People should not rake weeds or plants out of the waterbody. If you are raking leaves in your lawn, please be sure to compost responsibility and far from the waterbody. Decomposing leaves and plant matter can increase nutrients and trigger unwanted algae blooms, these algae can consume oxygen which causes fish kills. Contact your city or town to find out the best way to dispose of yard waste.\n\nThe advisory will remain in effect until further notice. Skin contact with water containing blue-green algae commonly causes irritation of the skin, nose, eyes, and/or throat. Common health effects associated with ingesting water containing algal toxins include stomachache, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. Rarer health effects include dizziness, headache, fever, liver damage, and nervous system damage. Young children and pets are at a particular risk for health effects associated with algal toxins. People who have had contact with these ponds and experience those symptoms should contact their healthcare provider. If you come into contact with the water, rinse your skin with clean water as soon as possible and, when you get home, take a shower and wash your clothes. Similarly, if your pet comes into contact with the water, immediately wash your pet with clean water. Do not let the animal lick algae off its fur. Call a veterinarian if your animal shows any symptoms of blue-green algae poisoning, including loss of energy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, or any unexplained sickness that occurs within a day or so after being in contact with water. People are cautioned that toxins may persist in the water after the blue-green algae bloom is no longer visible.\n\nIt is possible that blue-green algae blooms may be affecting other waterbodies in Rhode Island. People are advised to avoid contact with waterbodies that exhibit bright green coloration in the water or at the water surface and/or dense floating algal mats that form on the water's surface. The water may look like green paint, thick pea soup, or green cottage cheese. To report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact DEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov and if possible, send a photograph of the reported algae bloom. For more information and current advisories, consult RIDEM's website: http://www.dem.ri.gov/bluegreen\n\nRIDOH Issues Reminder About Proper Use of Antibiotics\n\nAs a part of on-going efforts to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria, the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is reminding Rhode Islanders about the importance of using antibiotics properly. People should only use antibiotics when they are truly necessary, and antibiotics should be used exactly as they are prescribed.\n\nAntibiotics save lives, but any time antibiotics are used, they can cause side effects and can lead to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent public health threats in the US today. Antibiotic resistance does not mean the body is becoming resistant to antibiotics; it means bacteria develop the ability to defeat the antibiotics designed to kill them. When bacteria become resistant, antibiotics cannot fight them, and the bacteria multiply. Some resistant bacteria can be hard or impossible to treat and can spread to other people.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the US each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result.\n\n\"When someone takes the time out of their day to go to the doctor, they want to walk out with a prescription that is going to make them feel better. But antibiotics are not always the answer,\" said Interim Director of Health Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH. \"In fact, they can sometimes make things even worse. By taking antibiotics when not appropriate, people put themselves at risk for serious side effects while also undermining our ability to use antibiotics as a life-saving tool for future generations.\"\n\nPublic health officials throughout the country and worldwide are taking similar measures to educate the public this week, during Antibiotic Awareness Week November 18-24. Governor Dan McKee has issued a proclamation declaring Nov. 18-24, 2023 as Antibiotic Awareness Week in Rhode Island.\n\nCDC and RIDOH encourage patients and families to:\n\n-- Get the facts about antibiotics. Antibiotics do not work on viruses, such as those that cause COVID-19, RSV, colds, flu, bronchitis, or runny noses, even if the mucus is thick, yellow, or green.\n\n-- Ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about alternatives to antibiotics.\n\n-- While your body fights off a virus, pain relievers, fever reducers, saline nasal spray or drops, warm compresses, liquids, and rest can help you feel better.\n\n-- If you need antibiotics, take them exactly as prescribed. Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about your antibiotics.\n\n-- Do your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy by washing hands, covering coughs, staying home when sick, and getting recommended vaccines, such as the flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines.\n\n-- Do not share prescription medications.\n\nIn addition to these action steps, talk with your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects from an antibiotic. Common side effects of antibiotics can include rash, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, or yeast infections. It is particularly important to talk to a healthcare provider if you experience severe diarrhea after taking an antibiotic. Severe diarrhea could be an indication of Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile or C. diff) infection, which needs to be treated. November is also C. Diff Awareness Month.\n\nIn addition to the impact on patient health, C. diff rates have a financial impact on hospitals under Medicare's Healthcare-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction and Value-Based Purchasing Programs. To help reduce these healthcare-acquired infections, RIDOH's Antimicrobial Stewardship and Environmental Cleaning Task Force has developed the CDI Playbook for Rhode Island healthcare providers and facilities.\n\n\"I commend the RIDOH's Antimicrobial Stewardship and Environmental Cleaning Task Force—a devoted team of nurses, pharmacists, and physicians. Together we crafted a playbook for Rhode Island's hospitals, aiding in the remarkable shift from ranking 51 out of 52 states in C. difficile rates to becoming a top-ten state with the lowest C. difficile lab test detection\" said Kerry L. LaPlante, PharmD., Professor and Chair of Pharmacy Practice and Clinical Research at the University of Rhode Island, and Chair of RIDOH's Antimicrobial Stewardship, and Environmental Task Force. \"This transformation reflects our unwavering dedication and strategic interventions, showcasing the impactful collaboration of a dedicated group in shaping a healthier future for Rhode Island.\"\n\nMore information and videos can be found at http://health.ri.gov/antibiotics and cdc.gov/antibiotic-use [cdc.gov].\n\n###\n\nHMC Farms Recalls Whole Peaches, Plums, and Nectarines\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that HMC Farms is recalling peaches, plums, and nectarines sold in retail stores between May 1 and November 15, 2022, and between May 1 and November 15, 2023.\n\nThe fruit is being recalled because it has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy people may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.\n\nThe recalled fruit was distributed nationwide and sold at retail stores. This recall includes only conventionally grown fruit. No organic fruit is being recalled.\n\nThe recalled peaches have been linked to an outbreak of Listeriosis that has resulted in eleven illnesses.\n\nAlthough the recalled fruit is no longer available in retail stores, consumers may have frozen the recalled fruit at home for later use. Consumers are urged to check their freezers for the recalled fruit, not consume it, and discard it.\n\n###\n\nRIDOH and DEM Recommend Lifting Restrictions for Blue-Green Algae in Worden Pond\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) recommend lifting the advisory restricting recreational activities at Worden Pond in South Kingstown. The advisory related to high levels of blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria.\n\nRecent consecutive surveys and sample analysis confirmed that blue-green algae is not present in detectable concentrations. These findings meet the advisory guidelines and support lifting the advisory.\n\nBlue-green algae conditions can change quickly, and it is possible that blooms may affect Worden Pond again, or other waterbodies in Rhode Island. The public should avoid contact with any body of water that is bright green or has a dense, floating algal mat on the water's surface. Blue-green algae blooms may look like green paint or thick pea soup. Toxins may persist in the water after a blue-green algae bloom is no longer visible.\n\nTo report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact DEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov\n\nState House Dome to Shine a Green Light on Injury Prevention\n\nIn support of National Injury Prevention Day on November 18, Rhode Island will join other states around the country in \"shining a light\" on efforts to stop injuries and violence—the number one cause of death and hospitalization nationally for people ages 1 to 44. Tomorrow will be the first time the Rhode Island State House dome will be lit green as a commitment to addressing injuries and violence.\n\n\"All of us, at every stage of life, can act to prevent injuries and violence. For some, injury prevention means safe sleep practices, putting children in car seats, fastening seatbelts, and wearing bike helmets. For some other folks, it may mean fall prevention strategies or safe firearm storage,\" said Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH, Interim Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH). \"We can all take steps to make our homes and communities safer places to live.\"\n\nRIDOH's Violence and Injury Prevention Program and partners are working to address all forms of injury and violence. Examples of projects include fall prevention initiatives; suicide prevention campaigns aimed at youth and Veterans; sexual violence prevention; and transportation safety. Earlier this year, Rhode Island was awarded $915,000 in federal funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a coordinated, data-driven suicide prevention program for higher-risk populations.\n\nFalls remain the most common injury sending Rhode Islanders to the emergency department (ED). Falls are also common causes of inpatient hospital admissions.\n\n\"Older adults can reduce the risk of falls by staying physically active, removing tripping hazards at home, keeping living spaces well lit, and using grab bars and railings,\" said Tosin Ojugbele, MD, MPH, the Medical Director of RIDOH's Division of Community, Health, and Equity. \"These steps can be part of a falls prevention strategy that you discuss with your health professional, who can help you assess your risk.\"\n\nData on injuries:\n\n- Data from 2016 to 2022 indicate that while annual ED visits for injuries have decreased from nearly 87,000 to nearly 63,000, disparities persist. Black non-Hispanic people and Hispanic people continue to have higher rates of injury-related ED visits compared to White people.\n\n- Common injury-related causes of ED visits after falls, include being struck by an object, motor vehicle-related injuries, assaults, and traumatic brain injury. Rhode Island data from 2022 show that females have higher fall rates compared to males. However, males have higher rates of being struck by an object, motor vehicle/traffic-related injuries, and assault.\n\n- While Rhode Island has one of the lowest rates of suicide deaths per 100,000 population in the country, suicide is the second-leading cause of death for those ages 10-34 and the eleventh-leading cause of death among all Rhode Island residents.\n\nOrganized by the Injury Free Coalition for Kids and its partners, the fourth annual National Injury Prevention Day aims to raise awareness about the effects of injury and violence on the public's health, as well as actions needed to build safer communities. Partners include Safe Kids Worldwide, Safe States Alliance, the American Trauma Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Be SMART—a program of Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, the Society for Advancement of Violence and Injury Research, the Trauma Center Association of America, and JPMA Cares.\n\nFor more information and resources on violence and injury prevention, visit http://health.ri.gov/violence.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

All stores have been notified, and products have been removed from retail shelves to protect public health. Consumers are strongly urged to dispose of any product remaining in their refrigerators.\n\nAffected products include Arruda's Dairy Farm Eggnog with best buy dates of 11/25/2023 and 12/09/2023.\n\nDuring a routine inspection conducted by RIDOH, pasteurization records indicated that the pasteurization did not reach the required temperature for select lots of eggnog. Since these pasteurization charts are the primary record of pasteurization, Arruda's Dairy Farm is performing a voluntary recall.\n\nPasteurization involves heating liquids to a specific temperature for a set period of time to kill harmful bacteria. Bacteria can grow in unpasteurized or improperly pasteurized products and cause illness.\n\nThere have been no illnesses reported to date. Arruda's Dairy Farm has identified the cause of the issue, and corrective actions have been taken to resolve the matter.\n\nConsumers with questions may contact Arruda's Dairy Farm at 401-624-8898.\n\nRIDOH and DEM Recommend Lifting Restrictions for Blue-Green Algae in Slack and Wenscott Reservoir\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) recommend lifting the advisory restricting recreational activities at Slack Reservoir in Smithfield and Wenscott Reservoir in North Providence. The advisories were related to high levels of blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria.??\n\nRecent consecutive surveys and sample analysis confirmed that blue-green algae is not present in detectable concentrations. These findings meet the advisory guidelines and support lifting the advisory.\n\nBlue-green algae conditions can change quickly, and it is possible that blooms may affect Slack Reservoir and Wenscott Reservoir again or other waterbodies in Rhode Island. The public should avoid contact with any body of water that is bright green or has a dense, floating algal mat on the water's surface. Blue-green algae blooms may look like green paint or thick pea soup. Toxins may persist in the water after a blue-green algae bloom is no longer visible.?\n\nTo report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact RIDEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov?\n\n###\n\nDog Food and Cat Food Recalled\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Mid America Pet Food is recalling dog and cat food with Best By Dates before 10/31/24. The recalled products were distributed under the brand names Victor Super Premium Dog Foods, Wayne Feeds Dog Food, Eagle Mountain Pet Food, and Member's Mark. A full list of the recalled products is available online (see link below).\n\nThe recalled products may be contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella can affect animals eating the products, and there is risk to humans from handling contaminated pet products, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact with the products or any surfaces exposed to these products.\n\nHealthy people infected with Salmonella should monitor themselves for some or all of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation, and urinary tract symptoms. Consumers exhibiting these signs after having contact with this product should contact their healthcare providers. Children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune systems may be at greater risk of Salmonella infection.\n\nPets with Salmonella infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Some pets will have may only exhibit decreased appetite, fever, and abdominal pain. Infected but otherwise healthy pets can be carriers and infect other animals or humans. If your pet has consumed the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian.\n\nThe Best By Date is found on the middle top of the back of each bag. This recall is being issued due to some of the product lots testing positive for Salmonella through random and targeted sampling of finished product, including by the firm and the South Carolina Department of Agriculture\n\nAs of November 1, 2023, seven people reported Salmonella infections.\n\nDo not feed the recalled product to pets or any other animals. Destroy the food in a way that children, pets, and wildlife cannot access. Wash and sanitize pet food bowls, cups, and storage containers. Always ensure that you wash and sanitize your hands after handling recalled food or any utensils that come in contact with recalled food.\n\nFor more information, people can contact Mid America Pet Food Consumer Affairs at 1-888-428-7544.\n\nRIDOH Issues Compliance Order to Owners of Roger Williams and Fatima Hospitals\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) issued an Immediate Compliance Order today requiring the owners of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to ensure the continuity of health services and care at the facilities by acting immediately to stabilize the two facilities financially.\n\nThis Immediate Compliance Order was issued to the California-based Prospect Medical Holdings and related entities after a thorough, extensive review by RIDOH determined that Prospect's underfunding of the hospitals is impacting operations. For example, in October 2023, at least 19 elective surgeries at the facilities were canceled because the proper equipment and supplies were not available because of non-payment to vendors. These latest issues are part of a pattern of Prospect Medical Holdings engaging in non-compliance and creating delays in making required disclosures of financial information.\n\nThe Immediate Compliance Order requires the owners to hire an independent Fiscal Monitor and cover all operating costs of the hospitals, as determined by that Fiscal Monitor. Prospect also must create a \"cash on hand\" escrow account to ensure the stability of the facilities, and have an independent Operations Monitor on site who will report to RIDOH daily. The Compliance Order includes many additional, stringent requirements in the areas of finance, operations, and oversight.\n\n\"The healthcare providers at Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital are amongst the best in the state. People receive very high-quality care at these hospitals,\" said Interim Director of Health Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH. \"However, these facilities need more consistent support from their corporate owners. The action we took today will ensure immediate accountability and get the hospitals on sounder footing. This is critical for the state as a whole, and for the communities these facilities serve as safety net hospitals.\"\n\nWhile Rhode Island law requires hospitals to maintain local governing bodies, much of the financial decision-making for these two hospitals happens in California. Prospect Medical Holdings sweeps all patient care revenue from Roger Williams and Fatima every day and then returns an operating allowance back to the hospitals once a week. The amounts of these allowances vary and are determined by Prospect Medical Holdings. The amounts of these allowances are inadequate to pay vendors in a timely manner, leading to interruptions in services.\n\nA RIDOH investigation revealed that, as of October 24, more than 250 of the hospitals' approximately 830 vendors were operating with the hospitals on a \"cash on demand\" basis. This means they only deliver supplies if they are paid at the time of delivery. This is generally reserved for payors with a history of non-payment. The average time it takes the hospitals to pay bills (\"days payable outstanding,\" or DPO), was in excess of the 90-day limit set when the acquisition of the facilities was approved in 2021.\n\nUnpaid vendors have included suppliers of hip joints, catheters, endoscopes, and eye lenses. The procedures that were canceled included endoscopies, eye surgeries, and a spinal surgery. There is no indication that issues with vendors ever prevented emergency procedures from being performed.\n\nAmong other requirements, the Immediate Compliance Order requires Prospect Medical Holdings to:\n\n- Retain a third-party Fiscal Monitor for six months. This person will immediately determine the average monthly operational expenses for the hospitals and create a plan to ensure that the DPO for all vendors is less than 90 days. The Fiscal Monitor will report to RIDOH weekly on the progress of vendor accounts and the general fiscal standing of the hospitals.\n\n- Retain a third-party Operations Monitor for six months. This person will be charged with doing an assessment of the extent to which vendor non-payment has previously impacted patient care and resulted in canceled surgeries. This person will report to RIDOH daily on census numbers at the hospitals, as well as on staffing and any procedure cancellations.\n\n- Provide funding over and above the weekly allowances to the hospitals to cover all operational expenses.\n\n- Create and fund a separate \"cash on hand\" escrow account equaling 30 days of average daily operational expenses for the sole use of operations at the hospitals. This account will be maintained by a RIDOH-approved escrow agent, located in Rhode Island.\n\nIn addition to these requirements, the Immediate Compliance Order states that RIDOH reserves the right to order a cease and desist on the daily sweeping of patient care revenue from the hospitals to the parent company in California.\n\nAdd Vaccination to Your Holiday Season To-Do List\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is urging people to get vaccinated now as part of their planning for Thanksgiving gatherings with family and friends.\n\nEveryone older than six months of age should get a flu shot every year. The 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine is also recommended for everyone older than six months of age. These vaccines are particularly important for older adults and people with underlying health issues, including weakened immune systems, diabetes, obesity, asthma, cancer, and heart or lung disease.\n\n\"It can take up to two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop and provide you with protection against viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. If you plan to see people on Thanksgiving and other holidays over the coming weeks, now is the best time to get vaccinated,\" said Interim Director of Health Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH. \"If you are not feeling well around the holidays, you should avoid gatherings. This is particularly true if you were planning to see any older adults or people with underlying health issues.\"\n\nFlu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine are available throughout Rhode Island at pharmacies, the offices of many primary care providers, and community health centers. These vaccines are also available at community clinics. These clinics are being held in the late afternoon and evening at schools and are open to the entire community. To register, go to http://covid.ri.gov/vaccination and click \"Community Clinic Registration.\" People can register for either COVID-19 vaccine (available at these clinics for people ages 5 and older), flu vaccine (available at these clinics for people ages 3 and older), or both vaccines. It is safe to receive both vaccines at the same visit. There is no insurance requirement and no cost for vaccination. People can get the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine even if they have not received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past.\n\nIn addition to flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine, many people are eligible for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, including pregnant people, infants under eight months, eligible children 8-19 months at increased risk, and many people 60 and older. Talk to your healthcare provider about RSV vaccination if you are in one of these groups.\n\nAdditional information about preventing respiratory viruses:\n\n- Stay home when you are sick. Stay home for at least 24 hours after a fever is gone. Temperature should be measured without the use of fever-reducing medicines (medicines that contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen). Avoid contact with others, especially older adults and people with underlying health conditions, if you are sick.\n\n- Wash your hands regularly throughout the day using soap for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands. Hand washing is especially important after touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; after leaving a public place; after touching objects or surfaces that may be frequently touched, such as door handles, light switches, and tables.\n\n- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands. Always wash your hands as soon as you can after you cough or sneeze.\n\n- Get tested for COVID-19 if you have any of the classic symptoms, like fever or chills, a runny nose, a cough, achiness, or loss of taste or smell. If you or someone you live with tests positive for COVID-19, there are steps you can take to prevent spreading the virus to others and protect yourself from getting very sick. The Isolation Calculator can help you determine how long you should stay home and isolate away from others (see link below). Learn more about doctor-recommended treatments for COVID-19 that can keep you from getting sicker and being hospitalized.\n\nBlue-Green Algae Bloom at Worden Pond, Tiogue Lake, and J.L Curran Upper Reservoir\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) are advising people to avoid contact with Worden Pond in South Kingstown, Briar Point Beach on Tiogue Lake in Coventry, and J.L Curran Upper Reservoir in Cranston, due to blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) bloom in the ponds.\n\nBlue-green algae can produce toxins that can harm humans and animals. Toxins and/or high cell counts have been detected in the pond by the RIDOH State Health Laboratories from water samples collected by DEM. All recreation, including swimming, fishing, boating, and kayaking, should be avoided. People should not ingest water or eat fish from the pond. Pets can also be affected by exposure to the algal toxins and thus owners should not allow pets to drink or swim in the water. The advisory will remain in effect until further notice. Skin contact with water containing blue-green algae commonly causes irritation of the skin, nose, eyes, and/or throat. Common health effects associated with ingesting water containing algal toxins include stomachache, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. Rarer health effects include dizziness, headache, fever, liver damage, and nervous system damage. Young children and pets are at a particular risk for health effects associated with algal toxins.\n\nPeople who have had contact with these ponds and experience those symptoms should contact their healthcare provider. If you come into contact with the water, rinse your skin with clean water as soon as possible and, when you get home, take a shower and wash your clothes. Similarly, if your pet comes into contact with the water, immediately wash your pet with clean water. Do not let the animal lick algae off its fur. Call a veterinarian if your animal shows any symptoms of blue-green algae poisoning, including loss of energy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, or any unexplained sickness that occurs within a day or so after being in contact with water. People are cautioned that toxins may persist in the water after the blue-green algae bloom is no longer visible.\n\nIt is possible that blue-green algae blooms may be affecting other waterbodies in Rhode Island. People are advised to avoid contact with waterbodies that exhibit bright green coloration in the water or at the water surface and/or dense floating algal mats that form on the water's surface. The water may look like green paint, thick pea soup, or green cottage cheese. To report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact DEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov and if possible, send a photograph of the reported algae bloom. For more information and current advisories, consult RIDEM's website: http://www.dem.ri.gov/bluegreen\n\nTips for a Healthy and Safe Halloween\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is reminding Rhode Islanders about Halloween safety precautions.\n\nHalloween street smarts:\n\n- Always accompany young children on their trick-or-treating rounds. Research shows that evenings from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. are the riskiest times of day for child pedestrians.\n\n- If your older children are trick-or-treating without you, plan and review a route that is acceptable to you. Agree on a specific time when they should return home.\n\n- Older children should travel in groups and create a \"buddy system.\"\n\n- Talk with kids about the risks of distracted walking. This includes texting, talking on or looking at a phone, and listening to music.\n\n- Cross the street as a group at crosswalks.\n\n- Stay on well-lit streets and always use the sidewalk. If no sidewalk is available, walk at the far edge of the roadway facing traffic.\n\n- Caution kids to never enter a home or a car for a treat.\n\nCostume safety tips:\n\n- Plan costumes that are bright and reflective. Consider adding reflective tape or striping to costumes and trick-or-treat bags for greater visibility.\n\n- Look for \"flame resistant\" on the costume labels. Wigs and accessories should also clearly indicate this.\n\n- Hats should fit properly to prevent them from sliding over eyes and blocking vision.\n\n- Consider non-toxic makeup and decorative hats as safer alternatives to masks.\n\n- Do not use decorative contact lenses without an eye exam and a prescription from an eye care professional.\n\nHealthy Halloween tips:\n\n- Consider offering non-edible goodies to trick-or-treaters (such as spider rings, vampire fangs, pencils, or bubbles). Halloween is one of the trickiest days of the year for children with food allergies.\n\n- Wait until children are home to sort and check treats before eating them.\n\n- Enjoy sweets in moderation.\n\nDriving:\n\n- Drive slowly in residential neighborhoods.\n\n- Watch for trick-or-treaters at intersections, medians, and on curbs.\n\n- Watch for trick-or-treaters darting from between parked cars.\n\n- Enter and exit driveways carefully.\n\n- If a teen driver is in your household, consider not allowing that person to drive after dark on Halloween. If you have a teen driver who will be driving, talk about precautions and set specific rules.\n\nContinue to take measures to prevent mosquito bites:\n\nThis has been a higher-than-average risk year for mosquito-borne diseases, including Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), in southeastern New England. Rhode Island is still in mosquito season until the first hard frost of the year, which Rhode Island has not had yet. (A hard frost is when temperatures are below 32 degrees for three consecutive hours.) For that reason, Rhode Islanders who will be outdoors on Halloween should continue to take mosquito bite prevention measures. These prevention measures are most important at sundown (and sunrise).\n\n- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n\n- Use EPA-approved bug spray with at least 20% DEET. Alternatively, people can use a bug spray with one of the following active ingredients: Picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD), or 2-undecanone. People should not use bug spray with DEET on infants under two months of age.\n\n- Put mosquito netting over baby carriages.\n\nVisit http://www.health.ri.gov/mosquito for additional mosquito prevention tips.\n\n2023-2024 COVID-19 Vaccine Available at Community Clinics\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is announcing that the updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine will be available at community clinics throughout the state over the coming weeks.\n\nThese clinics will be held in the late afternoon and evening at schools and are open to the entire community. To register, go to http://covid.ri.gov/vaccination and click \"Community Clinic Registration.\" People can register for either COVID-19 vaccine (available at these clinics for people ages 5 and older), flu vaccine (available at these clinics for people ages 3 and older), or both vaccines. It is safe to receive both vaccines at the same visit. There is no insurance requirement and no cost for vaccination. People can get the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine even if they have not received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past.\n\n\"Everyone older than six months of age should get the updated COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination is especially important for older adults and people with underlying health issues,\" said Interim Director of Health Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH. \"Just like the flu, the virus that causes COVID-19 is always changing, and protection from COVID-19 vaccines declines over time. Getting your updated COVID-19 vaccine helps restore your protection and is one of the best steps you can take to avoid serious illness and hospitalization.\"\n\nIn addition to preventing serious illness, COVID-19 vaccine can also help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to people who are more vulnerable to the health effects of COVID-19, including older adults and people with underlying health issues. Vaccination also reduces your chance of experiencing Long COVID (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html [cdc.gov]), which can develop during or following acute infection and last for an extended period of time.\n\nClinics are being held during school hours for students, in addition to these afternoon and evening community clinics. Schools that already held their flu vaccination clinics will be given the opportunity to hold additional clinics to make the updated COVID-19 vaccine available. Schools are communicating directly with families about these clinics for students. People who have already registered for a flu vaccine at a daytime or evening clinic who wish to add a COVID-19 vaccine may complete the online COVID-19 vaccine consent form through the registration system and both vaccines will be given at the same appointment. People may select any available timeslot as a placeholder. Pre-registration is required to guarantee an appointment. Walk-ins will be accepted on a limited basis, as resources allow.\n\nAdditional information about preventing respiratory viruses:\n\n- Get your flu shot. Everyone older than six months of age should be vaccinated against the flu every year.\n\n- Stay home when sick. Stay home for at least 24 hours after a fever is gone. Temperature should be measured without the use of fever-reducing medicines (medicines that contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen). Avoid contact with others, especially older adults and people with underlying health conditions, if you are sick.\n\n- Wash your hands regularly throughout the day using soap for at least 20 seconds.

These products contain elevated lead levels.\n\nThis health advisory is being issued for all lot codes of WanaBana Apple Cinnamon Fruit Puree Pouches, with any expiration dates. These products were sold nationally and are available through multiple retailers including Sam's Club, Amazon, and Dollar Tree.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was recently made aware of a developing investigation by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services (NCDA&CS) regarding four children with elevated blood lead levels, indicating potential acute lead toxicity. The NCDHHS investigation identified WanaBana Apple Cinnamon Fruit Puree Pouches as a potential shared source of exposure. As part of their investigation, NCDHHS analyzed multiple lots of WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree, detecting extremely high concentrations of lead. The FDA has reviewed and supports NCDHHS's analytical findings and found that analytical results at this level could result in acute toxicity.\n\nLead is toxic to humans and can affect people of any age or health status. Lead exposure in children is often difficult to see. Most children have no obvious immediate symptoms. If there's suspicion that a child may have been exposed to lead, parents should talk to their child's healthcare provider about getting a blood test. Although lead can only be diagnosed through clinical testing, signs and symptoms of lead toxicity vary based on exposure.\n\nShort-term exposure to lead could result in the following symptoms:\n\n• Headache\n\n• Abdominal pain/Colic\n\n• Vomiting\n\n• Anemia\n\nLonger term exposure could result in additional symptoms:\n\n• Irritability\n\n• Lethargy\n\n• Fatigue\n\n• Muscle aches or muscle prickling/burning\n\n• Occasional abdominal discomfort\n\n• Constipation\n\n• Difficulty concentrating/Muscular exhaustibility\n\n• Headache\n\n• Tremor\n\n• Weight loss\n\nUtopia Foods Recalls Enoki Mushrooms\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Utopia Foods is recalling all lots of their 200-gram packages of Enoki Mushrooms because they have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nThe recalled Enoki Mushrooms were distributed to wholesalers in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Maryland. Products may have been further distributed to retail locations such as grocery stores. The product comes in a 200 gram, clear plastic package with barcode 8928918610109 marked on the packaging. All products in the recall and were distributed between August 7, 2023 and October 20, 2023.\n\nListeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, Listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.\n\nThe potential contamination was noted by a routine sampling conducted by the State of West Virginia on products which were further distributed by Utopia's customers. The products tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nConsumers who have purchased the 200-gram packages of \"Enoki Mushrooms\" are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 718-389-8898.\n\nGreenhead Lobster Products Recalled\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is advising consumers that Greenhead Lobster Products is recalling all frozen and refrigerated cooked lobster meat products produced from May 9, 2023 through October 19, 2023. These products have the potential to be contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nThe recalled products were sold frozen or refrigerated in packages ranging from 1 to 2 lbs. or in cases up to 12 lbs. and can be identified with \"best if used by\" dates ranging from May 9, 2025 to October 12, 2025 for frozen products, and May 27, 2023 to October 30, 2023 for refrigerated products. The \"best if used by\" date is located on the white label on the front of the package.\n\nProducts were directly distributed to Maine and New Hampshire and then sold nationwide through wholesale distributors and online via e-commerce.\n\nListeria monocytogenes is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.\n\nAlthough none of the recalled products has tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, the recall is being conducted based on the presence of the organism in the processing environment. No other Greenhead Lobster retail products are impacted by this recall, including raw products.\n\nConsumers who have purchased any of the products listed should not consume the product and can return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.\n\nThe company's customer service desk is available to answer questions at Recall@greenheadlobster.com.\n\nRIDOH and DEM Recommend Avoiding Contact with Blue-Green Algae Bloom at Carbuncle Pond\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) are advising people to avoid contact with Carbuncle Pond in Coventry due to blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) bloom in the lake. Blue-green algae can produce toxins that can harm humans and animals. Toxins and/or high cell counts have been detected in ponds by the RIDOH State Health Laboratory from water samples collected by DEM.\n\nAll recreation, including swimming, fishing, boating, and kayaking, should be avoided.

People are advised to avoid contact with waterbodies that exhibit bright green coloration in the water or at the water surface and/or dense floating algal mats that form on the water's surface. The water may look like green paint, thick pea soup, or green cottage cheese. To report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact DEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov and if possible, send a photograph of the reported algae bloom. For more information and current advisories, consult RIDEM's website: http://www.dem.ri.gov/bluegreen\n\nRIDOH and DEM Recommend Avoiding Contact with Blue-Green Algae Bloom at Spectacle Pond, Mashapaug Pond, and Little Pond\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) are advising people to avoid contact with Spectacle Pond in Cranston, Mashapaug Pond in Providence, and Little Pond in Warwick due to blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) bloom in the lake. Blue-green algae can produce toxins that can harm humans and animals. Toxins and/or high cell counts have been detected in ponds by the RIDOH State Health Laboratory from water samples collected by DEM.\n\nAll recreation, including swimming, fishing, boating, and kayaking, should be avoided. People should not ingest water or eat fish from the ponds. Pets can also be affected by exposure to the algal toxins so owners should not allow pets to drink or swim in the water. The advisory will remain in effect until further notice.\n\nSkin contact with water containing blue-green algae commonly causes irritation of the skin, nose, eyes, and/or throat. Common health effects associated with ingesting water containing algal toxins include stomach ache, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. Rarer health effects include dizziness, headache, fever, liver damage, and nervous system damage. Young children and pets are at a particular risk for health effects associated with algal toxins. People who have had contact with these ponds and experience those symptoms should contact their healthcare provider.\n\nIf you come into contact with the water, rinse your skin with clean water as soon as possible and, when you get home, take a shower and wash your clothes. Similarly, if your pet comes into contact with the water, immediately wash your pet with clean water. Do not let the animal lick algae off its fur. Call a veterinarian if your animal shows any symptoms of blue-green algae poisoning, including loss of energy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, or any unexplained sickness that occurs within a day or so after being in contact with water. People are cautioned that toxins may persist in the water after the blue-green algae bloom is no longer visible.\n\nIt is possible that blue-green algae blooms may be affecting other waterbodies in Rhode Island. People are advised to avoid contact with waterbodies that exhibit bright green coloration in the water or at the water surface and/or dense floating algal mats that form on the water's surface. The water may look like green paint, thick pea soup, or green cottage cheese. To report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact DEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov and if possible, send a photograph of the reported algae bloom.

With the enhanced system in place, alerts can now go out daily to first responders and other healthcare professionals, harm reduction organizations, local leaders, and residents in impacted areas. RIDOH will also have the ability to monitor daily opioid overdose trends statewide, regional hot spots, and the utilization of emergency medical care.\n\n\"The faster we can get overdose data to our community partners, the more effective their overdose prevention strategies will be,\" said Interim Director of Health Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH. \"Using data to inform action is a key strategy in our work to prevent overdoses and save lives in Rhode Island.\"\n\nWhile data on fatal overdoses is central to Rhode Island's overall overdose prevention strategy, it can take several weeks or months to confirm fatal overdoses (because of the complex toxicology testing often needed). By tracking suspected non-fatal overdoses (through data on emergency department visits and EMS runs), RIDOH can get life-saving information into the community almost right away.\n\nRhode Island is divided into 11 overdose regions, based on past overdose trends. Each region has its own overdose threshold, based on the previous year of overdose data. Overdose Spike Alerts are sent based on exceedances of these thresholds. (These were previously called Rhode Island Overdose Action Area Response Public Health Alerts, or ROAARs.)\n\nIn addition to daily monitoring of overdose activity, RIDOH has implemented a three-tiered approach to address increases in local overdose activity. This plan, called the Levels of Response, deploys public health strategies based on the overdose activity occurring in a particular region. These levels range from an initial overdose spike, a sustained overdose spike, or a sustained high rate of burden in that region.\n\nIf a region has a sustained overdose spike or a sustained high rate of overdose burden, RIDOH will respond with additional targeted notification to the area, including involving community partners for increased outreach and convening an emergency community meeting. The burden rate can also help inform funding priorities and/or program implementation.\n\nTo view these data, visit RIDOH's Drug Overdose Surveillance Data Hub at https://health.ri.gov/data/drugoverdoses.

WNV is spread to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nThe person who tested positive was a resident of Newport County in their 70s who developed symptoms of WNV in late August and is recovering.\n\n\"Mosquito season in Rhode Island is not over. People need to continue taking prevention measures through the first hard frost,\" said Interim Director of Health Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH. \"The best way to prevent mosquito-borne diseases is to prevent mosquitoes from breeding and to avoid mosquito bites. Mosquitoes breed in water, so you should get rid of anything around your house and yard that collects water, such as tires, planters, and old trash cans or recycling bins. You should use repellent, and also wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when you are outside, especially at sunrise and sunset.\"\n\nThere continues to be an increased level of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and WNV circulating in mosquitoes this year in Rhode Island and the Northeast. Connecticut has confirmed four WNV cases in a human and Massachusetts has confirmed three human cases this year. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) and RIDOH have confirmed 13 WNV findings in mosquito samples from around Rhode Island as of last Friday: six in Westerly, two in Barrington, and one each in Central Falls, Cranston, Johnston, Richmond, and Tiverton. DEM and RIDOH will be announcing the latest mosquito sample findings on Friday.\n\nCommon symptoms of WNV include fever, headache, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes swollen lymph glands or a skin rash. Although many people who are infected with WNV show no symptoms, symptoms last for some people for several days or several weeks.\n\nProtect yourself:\n\n- Put screens on windows and doors. Fix screens that are loose or have holes.\n\n- At sunrise and sundown (when mosquitoes are most active), consider rescheduling outdoor activities. If you must be outside, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants and use bug spray.\n\n- Use EPA-approved bug spray with one of the following active ingredients: DEET (20-30% strength); picaridin, IR3535; and oil of lemon eucalyptus or paramenthane. Do not use bug spray with DEET on infants under two months of age. Children should be careful not to rub their eyes after bug spray has been applied on their skin. Wash children's hands with soap and water to remove any bug spray when they return indoors.\n\n- Get rid of mosquito breeding grounds:\n\n- Get rid of anything around your house and yard that collects water. Just one cup of water can produce hundreds of mosquitoes.\n\n- Clean your gutters and downspouts so that they can drain properly.\n\n- Remove any water from unused swimming pools, wading pools, boats, planters, trash and recycling bins, tires, and anything else that collects water, and cover them.\n\n- Remove or treat any shallow water that can accumulate on top of a pool cover.\n\n- Change the water in birdbaths at least once a week and rinse out birdbaths once a week.\n\nGovernor McKee, Health Officials Kick Off Flu Vaccination Campaign\n\nGovernor Dan McKee joined leaders from the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) today to get his flu shot and encourage everyone 6 months of age and older to get their flu shots to stay as healthy as possible this fall and winter.\n\n\"Getting a flu shot is your best protection against serious illness from the flu, and it's also the best way to protect the people you love by helping reduce the spread of the flu,\" said Governor McKee. \"For that reason, we have worked to make sure that plenty of flu vaccine is available in every community in Rhode Island. Make your plans to get vaccinated today.\"\n\nThe flu vaccination campaign kick-off event was held at Blackstone Valley Prep Elementary School 2 in Cumberland. A community-wide vaccination clinic will be held today at the school from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. More than 225 flu vaccination clinics will be held at schools throughout Rhode Island this year, many of them in the afternoon and evening. The afternoon and evening clinics are open to the entire community. There is no insurance required, and there is no cost for the vaccine at these clinics. For a full list of clinics, https://health.ri.gov/flu.\n\n\"The flu is more than just a bad cold. The flu is a serious virus that keeps many people in bed for a week. This could mean missing a lot of time at work because you are sick, or having to stay home with a sick child who can't go to school,\" said Dr. Tosin Ojugbele, the Medical Director of RIDOH's Division of Community Health and Equity. \"Flu vaccination is important every year because the flu strains we see each year are different. Flu shots are fast, easy, and free. Make sure you get yours today.\"\n\nDuring typical flu seasons, the flu results in approximately 1,000 hospitalizations and many fatalities. For example, during the 2022-2023 flu season, the flu resulted in 819 hospitalizations and there were 32 flu-associated deaths.\n\nRIDOH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend flu shots for everyone six months of age and older. Flu shots are especially important for certain people, including:\n\n- Anyone 50 and older (CDC recommends the use of specific flu vaccines for adults 65 and older, including higher dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines),\n\n- Healthcare workers,\n\n- Anyone who lives in a long-term care facility,\n\n- Children younger than 5 years of age,\n\n- People who are pregnant, and\n\n- People with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and asthma.\n\nIn addition to the school clinics, there are many other places in Rhode Island where flu shots are available. Those locations include pharmacies, many worksite clinics, community clinics, and the offices of many primary care providers.\n\nAfter getting a flu shot, some people may experience a slight ache at the injection site or a low-grade fever. That means the vaccine is working – your body is learning to fight the virus. These mild symptoms are much less significant than the actual flu.\n\nIn addition to flu vaccination, RIDOH and CDC also recommend that Rhode Islanders 6 months of age and older get their updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine. People can get the flu vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. The updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine is available in the offices of many primary care providers, pharmacies, federally qualified health centers, and other settings. People can get the updated COVID-19 vaccine even if they have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 previously. Visit vaccines.gov [vaccines.gov] to find providers that offer no-cost COVID-19 vaccines through the Bridge Access Program.\n\nIn addition to getting vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19, Rhode Islanders can take other steps to stay healthy and safe over the coming months:\n\n- Wash your hands often during the day. Use warm water and soap. If soap and water are not available, use alcohol-based hand gel.\n\n- Cough or sneeze into your elbow to prevent other people from getting sick.\n\n- Stay home if you are sick.\n\n- Keep surfaces (especially bedside tables, surfaces in the bathroom, and toys for children) clean by wiping them down with a household disinfectant.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\n- List of vaccination clinics and general information about the flu: https://health.ri.gov/flu [RI Flu Vaccination Site Locator].\n\n- Information about the flu in Spanish: https://health.ri.gov/gripe.\n\n- People with additional questions, including questions about where to get vaccinated if you do not have insurance, can call the Health Information Line at 401-222-5960 / RI Relay 711.\n\nMedia Release: RIDOH and DEM Recommend Lifting Restrictions for Blue-Green Algae in Tiogue Lake, Coomer Lake, and Georgiaville Pond\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) recommend lifting the advisory restricting recreational activities at Tiogue Lake in Coventry, at Coomer Lake in Glocester, and at Georgiaville Pond in Smithfield. The advisories were related to high levels of blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria.\n\nRecent consecutive surveys and sample analysis confirmed that blue-green algae have been present but at acceptably low levels and that cyanotoxin is not present in detectable concentrations. These findings meet the advisory guidelines and support lifting the advisory.\n\nBlue-green algae conditions can change quickly, and it is possible that blooms may affect other water bodies in Rhode Island. The public should avoid contact with any body of water that is bright green or has a dense, floating algal mat on the water's surface. Blue-green algae blooms may look like green paint or thick pea soup. Toxins may persist in the water after a blue-green algae bloom is no longer visible.\n\nTo report suspected blue-green algae blooms, contact RIDEM's Office of Water Resources at 222-4700 or DEM.OWRCyano@dem.ri.gov\n\nRhode Island Remains a Vaccination Leader Nationwide\n\nRhode Island continues to be a national leader in adolescent immunizations, with Rhode Island teens at or above the national averages for every vaccine type, according to recently released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\"Rhode Island's immunization success is directly attributable to the dedication of our community partners and healthcare workforce, including primary care providers, school nurses, and pharmacists,\" said Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH, Interim Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH). \"Prevention is a fundamental principle of public health. By vaccinating Rhode Island children so well, we are helping to control healthcare costs, we are preventing the serious health consequences of many illnesses, and we are giving everyone in our state the opportunity to be as healthy as possible. With flu vaccine and the updated COVID-19 vaccine to be widely available in Rhode Island in the coming weeks, I encourage everyone to continue putting prevention first by getting vaccinated.\"\n\nRhode Island highlights:\n\n• Rhode Island saw minor decreases in adolescent vaccination coverage rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but overall coverage increased from 2021 to 2022, returning to rates similar to those in the 2020 survey (which represents pre-pandemic levels).\n\n• Rhode Island has the nation's highest rate for 13 to 17-year-olds who are up to date on their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. 94.6% of Rhode Islanders in this age group have had at least one dose, compared to 76.0% nationally.\n\n• Rhode Island continues to exceed national vaccination averages for adolescent Tdap vaccination (preventing tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis). 95.1% of Rhode Islanders 13-17 years old have had at least one dose, compared to 89.9% of adolescents in this age group nationally. Rhode Island is also a national leader in MenACWY vaccination (meningococcal conjugate vaccine). 96.2% of Rhode Islanders 13-17 years old have had at least one dose, compared to 88.6% of adolescents in this age group nationally.\n\nThe Rhode Island Child and Adult Immunization Registry (RICAIR) contributes to Rhode Island's high vaccination rates. RICAIR is a statewide health information system that houses child and adult immunization records in one unified system, which healthcare providers can access statewide to coordinate care for patients. An additional factor in Rhode Island's immunization success is its Universal Vaccine Policy. This Universal Vaccine Policy allows healthcare providers to order all vaccines from the state for children from birth through 18 years of age, and most recommended vaccines for adults, at no cost. (As a condition of enrollment in the system, providers have to vaccinate patients at no cost.)\n\nThe data were collected using the CDC's National Immunization Survey-Teen. Vaccination estimates are generated by calling randomly selected phone lines nationally among households that include adolescents from 13 to 17 years of age. Parents and guardians are interviewed to obtain adolescent, maternal, and household information and are asked to provide consent for their adolescent's vaccine providers to be contacted. Data is not collected on every individual, so the true vaccination rates (and therefore rankings) could be slightly higher or lower.\n\nComplete Rhode Island immunization data are available online at https://ricair-data-rihealth.hub.arcgis.com/ [ricair-data-rihealth.hub.arcgis.com]\n\n###\n\nRIDOH and DEM Recommend Avoiding Contact with Lower Melville Pond in Portsmouth\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) are advising people to avoid contact with Lower Melville Pond in Portsmouth, due to blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) blooms. Blue-green algae can produce toxins that can harm humans and animals. Blue-green algae can produce toxins that can harm humans and animals. RIDOH's State Health Laboratories detected high concentrations of cyanobacteria toxins in the water collected by DEM.\n\nPeople should be careful not to ingest water or eat fish from the ponds. All recreation, including fishing, boating, and kayaking, should be avoided. Animals who may ingest pond water are especially at risk from exposure to the algal toxins, so owners should not allow pets to drink or swim in the water. The advisory will remain in effect until further notice.\n\nSkin contact with water containing blue-green algae commonly causes irritation of the skin, nose, eyes, and/or throat.

The recall comes after an issue was identified with wrapping machines, making it possible that a thin strip of the individual film may remain on the slice after the wrapper is removed. If the film sticks to the slice and is not removed, it could become a gagging or choking hazard.\n\nThe company is recalling:\n\n- 16 oz. Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product with an individual package UPC of 0 2100061526 1 and a \"Best When Used By\" date of 10 JAN 24 through 27 JAN 24. Individual packages in this recall will contain an S and 72 in the Manufacturing code.\n\n- 3 lb. multipacks of Kraft Singles American Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product with a carton UPC of 0 2100060491 3 and a \"Best When Used By\" of 09 JAN 2024 through 13 JAN 2024 and 16 JAN 2024.\n\nThe issue was discovered after Kraft received several consumer complaints about finding the plastic stuck to a slice, including six complaints of consumers saying they choked or gagged in connection with the issue.\n\nKraft Heinz has fixed the machine that wrapped the affected slices and all other processing machines have been thoroughly inspected.\n\nConsumers who purchased these items should not consume them and can return them to the store where they were purchased for an exchange or refund. Consumers can contact Kraft Heinz from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday, at 1-800-280-8252 to see if a product is part of the recall and to receive reimbursement.\n\nUpdated 2023-2024 COVID-19 Vaccine to be Available in Rhode Island\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) is recommending that everyone six months of age and older get the updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the potentially serious outcomes of COVID-19 illness this fall and winter.\n\nVaccine will become increasingly available over the next several weeks at sites throughout Rhode Island. The 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine will be available in the offices of many primary care providers, pharmacies, federally qualified health centers, and other settings. People can call these sites to inquire about availability and make appointments. People can get this updated COVID-19 vaccine even if they have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 previously.\n\nPeople can get no-cost COVID-19 vaccines from healthcare providers, federally qualified health centers, and retail pharmacy chains participating in the Bridge Access Program. Visit vaccines.gov [vaccines.gov] to find providers that offer no-cost COVID-19 vaccines through the Bridge Access Program.\n\n\"Just like the flu, the virus that causes COVID-19 is always changing, and protection from COVID-19 vaccines declines over time. Getting your updated COVID-19 vaccine helps restore your protection, and is one of the best steps you can take to avoid serious illness and hospitalization,\" said Interim Director of Health Utpala Bandy, MD, MPH. \"Our team has been preparing to ensure that this vaccine is available in Rhode Island in the coming weeks.\"\n\nIn addition to preventing serious illness, COVID-19 vaccine can also help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to people who are more vulnerable to the health effects of COVID-19, including older adults and people with underlying health issues. Vaccination also reduces your chance of experiencing Long COVID [cdc.gov [cdc.gov]], which can develop during or following acute infection and last for an extended period of time.\n\nOn Monday experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the use of this updated COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is a monovalent vaccine, meaning that it targets one variant, the Omicron variant XBB.1.5. It is an mRNA vaccine. On Tuesday a group that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, voted to recommend this vaccine for everyone older than six months of age who has not received a COVID-19 vaccine in the last two months. The CDC accepted this recommendation.\n\nVaccine recommendations\n\n- Everyone aged five years and older should get one dose of 2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of previous vaccination history, at least two months after the last dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n- People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may get additional doses of updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. People in this situation should talk to their healthcare providers about the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n- Children from six months to five years of age who have previously been vaccinated against COVID-19 can get one dose of the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine. However, children six months to five years who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 previously may need multiple doses. Parents and guardians should talk to their child's healthcare provider.\n\nAdditional information about preventing respiratory viruses\n\n- Get your flu shot. Everyone older than six months of age should be vaccinated against the flu every year. Vaccine for the 2023-2024 flu season will be available throughout Rhode Island in the coming weeks. You can get a flu shot and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time.\n\n- Stay home when sick. Stay home for at least 24 hours after a fever (temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 37.8 degrees Celsius or higher) is gone. Temperature should be measured without the use of fever-reducing medicines (medicines that contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen). Avoid contact with others, especially older adults and people with underlying health conditions, if you are sick.\n\n- Wash your hands regularly throughout the day using soap for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands. Hand washing is especially important before touching your eyes, nose, or mouth; after leaving a public place; after touching objects or surfaces that may be frequently touched by other people, such as door handles and tables.\n\n- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands. Always wash your hands as soon as you can after you cough or sneeze.\n\n- Get tested for COVID-19 if you have any of the classic symptoms, like fever or chills, a runny nose, a cough, achiness, or loss of taste or smell. If you or someone you live with tests positive for COVID-19, there are steps you can take to prevent spreading the virus to others and protect yourself from getting very sick. The Isolation Calculator (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html [cdc.gov]) can help you determine how long you should stay home and isolate away from others. Learn more about doctor-recommended treatments for COVID-19 that can keep you from getting sicker and being hospitalized.\n\nRIDOH and DEM Blue-Green Algae Advisories: J. L. Curran Advisory Lifted; Wenscott and Slack's Reservoir Remain in Effect\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) recommend lifting the advisory restricting recreational activities at J. L. Curran Reservoir in Cranston. RIDOH and RIDEM are also extending the advisory to avoid contact with all of Wenscott Reservoir in North Providence and all of Slack's Reservoir in Smithfield due to blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) bloom in the lake.
