        "text": "In the story: Humans arrive on a new planet not fully understanding the power they wield.\n\nThese are teaching materials for a short story that would be considered nontraditional. The assessments included vocabulary acquisition, critical thinking questions, and recall or comprehension questions on one sheet. These questions come in the form of a mixture of matching, short answers, and multiple-choice. By completing this sheet, the student will demonstrate an understanding of the material on multiple levels.\n\nThe other assessment is a creative art sheet. The creative art sheet asks the student to use the details from the story and their own knowledge, experiences, and imagination to synthesize a totally new work. This is a picture that is a visual representation that recreates a scene, character, or maybe the student's use or view of an aspect of the story. Along with this picture, the student will explain their work with a short explanation.\n\nThe story was published as part of Microcosmic Tales: 100 Wondrous Science Fiction Short-Short Stories. A book of science-fiction miniatures by acclaimed writers offers intriguing portraits of a superman who lives in a real world of nuclear danger. This android dreams of electric love, a universe put right by a cosmic tinkerer, and more. The whole collection is available (or will be soon) in my store at a much lower price as a collection when compared to buying individual stories.\n\nThe materials provided\n\n1 worksheet\n\n1 Creative Art Sheet\n\nAnswer Key\n\nLinks work until they donâ€™t (they are not mine).\n\nLink to the story:\n\nhttps://1lib.us/book/4341326/08b4f1\n\nNOTE: I have decided to include the Word Documents that the PDFs were created from so that you can customize the unit for your classroom. However, I have used formatting and custom fonts that are not standard with many Microsoft Office versions. This may mean that opening them with a different version of office or without the same fonts installed will throw the formatting off. If so, it may take some work to adapt them in your class. I am including them as an extra and would ask that I am not rated on the usability of the Word Docs."
