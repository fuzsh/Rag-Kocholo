        "text": "BROWARD COUNTY, Fla. (WTXL) — Charlie Adelson, the former brother-in-law of murdered Florida State University law professor Dan Markel, was arrested Thursday in connection to Markel's killing.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, it's alleged that Adelson arranged the killing so his sister could move back to the Fort Lauderdale area from Tallahassee with her two children.\n\nAdelson was arrested by FBI agents and booked into Broward County Jail on charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation of murder.\n\nAccording to State Attorney Jack Campbell, a Grand Jury indicted him Wednesday and he was taken into custody without incident.\n\nRELATED: Unraveling 5-year mystery of murdered FSU professor Dan Markel\n\nMarkel's family released a statement following the announcements of Adelson's arrest, thanking those who helped in the arrest and subsequent arrest.\n\n“The Markel Family is deeply grateful to the State Attorney’s Office, the FBI, and all members of law enforcement for their tireless pursuit of justice. Nearly eight years after Danny’s tragic murder, these dedicated public servants continue to fight to honor Danny’s memory and to hold accountable all those responsible for his horrific death. On behalf of Danny’s family and friends in the Tallahassee community and all over the world, thank you.”\n\nStatement of Orin Snyder and Matt Benjamin, Attorneys for the Markel Family\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Adelson's attorneys maintained their client's innocence.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nBeginning with a messy divorce in 2013, Markel's wife Wendi Adelson was denied a request to move her children to South Florida. In July of 2014, Markel was shot multiple times and died from his injuries.\n\nRELATED: Dan Markel Case: What You Need to Know\n\nLuis Rivera pled guilty to second-degree murder in the Markel case on Oct. 4, 2016.\n\nThe mother of Rivera's children, Katherine Magbanua, was also charged for her involvement in Markel's murder.\n\nIn October 2019, Garcia was found guilty of murdering Markel and conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nAlso in October 2019, a mistrial was declared in Magbanua’s first trial in the murder of Markel. Magbanua’s second trial is set to begin on May 16.\n\nPolice have said Magbanua had relationships with one of the alleged gunmen and Charles Adelson, the brother of Markel's ex-wife Wendi Adelson. Court records say Magbanua received payments from the Adelson family.\n\nRELATED: Missed our coverage of the Dan Markel murder trial? We've got you covered\n\nIn a September 2021 court filing by Magbanua’s defense team to disqualify the Leon County State Attorney’s Office, the state attorney’s office says Magbanua was used to contract Sigfredo Garcia on behalf of the Adelson family to murder Markel.\n\nAdelson was previously requested to be a witness in the retrial of Magbanua."
