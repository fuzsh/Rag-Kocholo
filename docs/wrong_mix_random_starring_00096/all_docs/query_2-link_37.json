        "text": "Daniel \"Danny\" Fitzgerald Reagan is a Detective in the New York City Police Department. He is part of the Major Case Squad and assigned to the 54th Precinct. Danny is the oldest child of Francis and Mary Reagan, as well as the older brother of Erin, Joe and Jamie.\n\nBiography\n\nDaniel Fitzgerald Reagan and his siblings grew up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Danny was happily married to Linda from 1996-2017, and they have two sons, Jack and Sean. They lived in Staten Island, at 1712 Amboy Road until their house was firebombed. During high school, he dated Marianne Romano, who was described by his partner Maria Baez as “the queen bee, super good looking, a little crazy and dynamite in the sack,” to which he agreed. As a young man, Danny and Walter Harrison Beene were construction workers.\n\nFor a class project of Nicky’s, Danny mentioned when he was three, he wanted to be a fireman for Halloween, however his grandfather Henry swore as long as he was alive, no Reagan would ever be a member of the New York City Fire Department. Henry then dressed Danny into a police uniform, and Danny “never took it off” until he became a Detective.\n\nDanny is a tireless worker and a highly skilled detective with keen instincts and years of experience. He firmly believes good old-fashioned policing is the best strategy to utilize when attempting to apprehend a suspect. He has made more arrests than any other detective in his precinct. His hard-nosed nature and short temper often exacerbates situations, causing him to go above and beyond the rules to close cases by taking advantage of his power. He has a tendency to act brutal towards the criminals he arrests, making it difficult to prosecute those criminals in court. His brutality towards criminals occasionally results in him being suspended. For example, in one episode he held a suspect over the edge of a building and threatened to let them fall if the suspect didn't \"come clean.\" Danny's old-school, authoritarian style clashes with those of his moderate siblings Jamie and Erin. Additionally, his style occasionally caused rifts between him and Linda, who became concerned and frustrated when Danny was unwilling to drop certain cases.\n\nAbove all, Danny is devoted to his family. In several situations, Danny loses his temper when people threaten his siblings, wife or children. Despite his gruff and aggressive nature, Danny is quick to sympathize with others. Danny is easily convinced into taking action or taking on a case, regardless of the circumstances. Outwardly, Danny is self-assured to the point of being arrogant, and quick to assert his authority as a detective. However Danny has been shown to be insecure and self-doubting, referring to himself as a grunt on one notable occasion. Danny maintained a close relationship with his late brother, Joe. In Family Secrets, Danny discovered Joe has one son, Joseph Hill.\n\nPhysical Characteristics\n\nDanny is 5'10\" (177cm)[1][2], approximately 160lbs (72.5kg)[3] and physically fit with hazel eyes. In most lighting his hair is brown. He has a widows peak and prefers to keep his hair cut very short. While most of his family are right handed, Danny has the distinction of being left handed.\n\nDistinguishing Marks\n\nDanny has two tattoos: Semper Fi over his heart, and a faded emblem on his shoulder.[4]\n\nCareer\n\nOn the job for fifteen years (as of season one), Danny took a leave of absence from the NYPD to serve two tours in the Iraq War as a Marine. Danny saw combat in Fallujah, and was the only member of his platoon to come home alive (resulting in some post-traumatic stress). During his time in the Marines, Danny was decorated for his heroism.\n\nDanny is an old-school detective. Danny's hotheaded nature and harsh methods he utilizes as a detective occasionally land him in trouble, which his father (Frank) worries about. When Frank was asked if his Danny “steps over the line” and violates procedure from time to time, Frank answered, “I think he probably steps on the line.” Therefore, he may bends the rules as opposed to breaking them. Danny is hard on other police officers and detectives when he perceives them to be unprofessional or uncommitted to their duties. He is part of the Major Case Squad and assigned to the 54th Precinct. He is currently partnered with Detective Maria Baez, a cop he's known for 20 years. During the series, it is mentioned he leads the Manhattan South Detective Borough in arrests and complaints[5]. In Love Stories, Danny and Baez were awarded the NYPD Medal for Valor for their performance in Partners.\n\nThroughout season six, Danny was taunted by Thomas Wilder who murdered and raped over twenty young women (ages 18-22). In Blowback, Danny rescued his niece, Nicole Reagan-Boyle, who was kidnapped from her dorm and eventually left in the trunk of Thomas' vehicle. After rescuing Nicky, Danny shot and killed Thomas after Thomas refused to show Danny his hands. At the beginning of season seven, he was investigated for his shooting of Thomas Wilder by Attorney General Robert Lewis and cleared of wrong-doing for the shooting.\n\nAfter the Wilder investigation, Danny fails to protect his next sexual assault victim. Erin points out after a family dinner Danny has changed. Danny admits after several internal investigations, he felt he didn't need to be investigated again. Danny later visits the victim and requests her to set up her ex-boyfriend to incriminate himself.\n\nIn season 1 Episode 7 \"Brothers\". When Jamie Went to see Daniel “Danny” Reagan in the 54th Precinct Danny, Gives Jamie there Grandfathers Henry Reagan BlackJack which Henry called it a Slapper, Which Henry Gave Danny when he first Joined the Force and Was assigned to the 12th Precinct which Danny also gave Jamie his 12th precinct collar pins, Jamie Turned down the Slapper but took the 12 pins. We later see Danny using the slapper Towards the end of the episode. so in his early years Danny worked in the 12th Precinct Just Like his Brothers Jamie and Joseph Regan.\n\nPartners\n\nOver his career, Danny had numerous partners to the point he acknowledged he burned through partners. Danny becomes very protective of his partners who stick around.\n\nDetective 2nd Grade DeMarcus King (Season 1, Episode 1)\n\nDetective 3rd Grade Ava Hotchkiss (Season 1, Episodes 2, 3, and 5) Detective Hotchkiss was Danny's first partner in the Major Case Squad. Danny did not not initially get along with her.[6]\n\nDetective 1st Grade Jacqueline Curatola – Partners with Danny from October 2010 (Season 1, Episode 4) until November 2012 (Season 3, Episode 7). Danny and Detective Curatola worked well together for the two years they were partners. However on November 2012, Detective Curatola decided to retire early from the NYPD after becoming mentally exhausted with her job.\n\nDetective 1st Grade Kate Lansing – Assigned to replace Detective Curatola, Detective Lansing worked with Danny for almost three months and the two worked well together. She transferred back to the Internal Affairs Bureau after the arrest of Captain Elwood.[7]\n\nDetective 3rd Grade Candice McElroy – Temporarily assigned to the 54th Precinct, Detective McElroy served as Danny’s brief partner in 2013. She transferred back to the Vice Enforcement Division.\n\nDetective 1st Grade Maria Baez – Danny’s partner since March 2013 (Season 3, Episode 17). Detective Baez was previously assigned to the NYPD Joint Bank Robbery Task Force for three years until its abolishment in 2011. Having known Detective Baez for twenty years, Danny frequently displays strong platonic feelings for Baez, most notably when he said he couldn't lose her.[8]\n\nSidney Gormley - Briefly went with Danny When his Partner Candice McElroy Left we see Gormley who was Seargent at the time working Briefly alongside Danny to keep him in check. And Again, During when Current Partner Maria Baez was testifying in court, Gormley working with Danny.\n\nDee Ann Carver - Briefly worked with Danny after Gormley left the 54th Precinct. Lieutenant Carver takes turns riding with all her Detectives to get a feel for how they work, and Danny was lucky number one. Carver drove the car, which made Danny uneasy. They hear gunshots during the ride, and call it in. They find a young woman of 18 to 23 years old with a bullet wound, and her baby also on the ground nearby. The baby fell out of her stroller but was unharmed. The young mother passed away from the gunshot, and they learned the baby’s father was the one who killed her. He couldn't face the guilt and shot himself in the head. Carver filed papers to adopt the baby girl herself.\n\nJudy Farrow - Danny worked briefly with Detective 1st Grade Judy Farrow in Season 11 Episode 7, In Too Deep, when Danny's neighbor, Sal, got shot by another neighbor, Joel, who shot him in revenge for sleeping with his wife, Dawn. Joel drove a 2018 Red Lamborghini Huracan Coupe, which Detective Farrow mistook for a late model Lamborghini Huracan Spider. Danny didn't want to give up the case to Detective Farrow, but his Lieutenant Mike Gee ordered him to because it wasn't in his precinct. The case is in Staten Island, the 120th precinct. Danny works in the 54th Precinct, but he wasn't going to just leave it be.\n\nDanny continues working the case, eventually getting caught by Detective Judy Farrow while questioning Sal at the hospital. Danny claims he's just visiting his neighbor, but Scott, Sal's son, said, \"Well, he's actually grilling his neighbor, as if my dad did something wrong.\" Detective Farrow then tells Danny he needs to leave, so he says goodbye to Sal and complies. Mike Gee then starts hammering Danny about working the case against orders. Danny's partner Maria Baez tells him he has a way of steamrolling everyone, so he apologizes to Farrow. She suspects an ulterior motive but Danny says not this time, and admits to his steamrolling tendencies that Baez pointed out.\n\nDanny finally gets his wish to work the case when Farrow, with Gee’s approval, invites him to join her on a visit to Joel's house, thinking a neighbor’s familiar face might put the man at ease. Joel wasn't home when they went there, only his wife, Dawn. She seemed nervous, and eventually admits she was the one who shot Sal. She says she wasn't in the car and didn't have her hand on the trigger, but it's her fault. Dawn then explains everything, and Danny and Farrow later arrest Joel. Sal’s son, Scott, threatens Joel with a bat, but Farrow takes him to the ground and threatens him with arrest.\n\nDanny worked with Texas Major Waylon Gates in Season 10 Episode 14, Fog of War, Season 12 Episode 10, Old Friends, and Season 13 Episode 15, Close to Home. Gates loves working with Danny and Danny only. They work very well together, getting the job done whether it's by the book or not.\n\nAnthony Abetemarco - When Danny works with Anthony, it’s usually against his will when Erin puts them on a case together, and Anthony is equally unhappy about it. But they are pros and do their jobs, usually succeeding despite their arguments that sometimes get in the way (and often provides some comic relief to the plot).\n\nJamie works briefly with his brother on multiple cases, mainly after Jamie is promoted to Sergeant. Danny the hothead reluctantly agrees to work with his little brother, giving him a hard time for being a boy scout, but still works with him and gets the job done.\n\nBugs is a C.I. (Confidential Informant) for Danny in Season 12 Episode 13 Cold Comfort, Season 13 Episode 5 Homefront, and Season 13 Episode 17 Smoke & Mirrors.\n\nMedals\n\nCitation Bars\n\nAmerican Flag Breast Bar\n\nWorld Trade Center Breast Bar\n\nMedal of Honor Breast Bar\n\nCombat Cross Breast Bar 2nd Award\n\nMedal for Valor Breast Bar\n\nHonorable Mention Breast Bar\n\nMeritorious Police Duty Breast Bar\n\nUSMC Service Breast Bar\n\nPersonality\n\nRelationships\n\nInvolved Shootings\n\nDukajan Kola (\"Officer Down\")\n\nBig Eyes (\"Chinatown\")\n\nRory Brennan (\"Dedication\")\n\nUnnamed Albanian Gangster (\"Moonlighting\")\n\nDonald \"Phantom\" Washington (\"The Life We Chose\")\n\nTwo of Uri Denko's henchmen (\"Working Girls\")\n\nTwo Assassins (\"Scorched Earth\")\n\nKarim Naduri (\"Risk and Reward\")\n\nOne of Bobby Mulrow's Captors (\"Risk and Reward\")\n\nOne of Otto Jackson's henchmen (\"Higher Education\")\n\nTwo of Adrian Baez's henchmen (\"Secrets and Lies\")\n\nDylan Sanders (\"Protest Too Much\")\n\nRaul Delgado (\"To Protect and Serve\")\n\nTwo of Benny Russo's henchmen (\"Bad Blood\")\n\nTwo Vasquez Family Hitmen (\"Ties That Bind\")\n\nTwo Bogeyman Drug Dealers (\"The Bogeyman\")\n\nTwo Mara Noche Gang Members (\"Partners\")\n\nOne of Tatiana's henchmen (\"Bad Company\")\n\nMSK Gang Member (\"Through the Looking Glass\")\n\nStanislav \"Stas\" Tarasenko (\"Worst Case Scenario\")\n\nRico (\"Backstabbers\")\n\nTrina Hamilton (\"Backstabbers\")\n\nUnnamed Member of John Bell's Crew (\"Blast from the Past\")\n\nJohn Bell (\"Blast from the Past\")\n\nThomas Wilder (\"Down the Rabbit Hole\")\n\nRonald Lloyd (\"In & Out\")\n\nDesmond \"Sundown\" Hill (\"A Deep Blue Goodbye\")\n\nSergei \"Rambo\" Karenin (\"Foreign Interference\")\n\nSix Mano Sangriento Cartel Members (\"The Thin Blue Line\")\n\nRaymond Stevens (\"Common Ground\")\n\nUnnamed Warrior Kings Gang Member (\"The Brave\")\n\nOne of Emily Bennett's Captors (\"Risk Management\")\n\nDerek Malbaton (\"Your Six\")\n\nCartel member (Close to Home\"\n\nYoung Man (Blues\"\n\nEquipment\n\nFirearms\n\nAs a Detective with the NYPD, Danny carries a Kahr K9 in 9×19mm as his service firearm.
