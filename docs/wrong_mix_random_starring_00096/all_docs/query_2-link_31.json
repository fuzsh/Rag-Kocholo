        "text": "​​​​HONOLULU - The Hawaii State Department of Education (DOE) today unveiled its new logo for the Ka Hei program designed by a Highlands Intermediate School student.\n\nTiffany Noda designed the award-winning entry that will be featured on all communications and materials associated with Ka Hei, a DOE program to integrate innovative energy technology with meaningful learning experiences. Noda focused on the Hawaiian definition of Ka Hei, which is to absorb knowledge or skill. She wants others to understand sustainability and prepare for the future.\n\nThe students who earned runner-up in the school-age divisions were:\n\nHayden Guest, Hanalei Elementary School\n\nLisa Watanabe, Highlands Intermediate School\n\nCharles Ombao, Aiea High School\n\n“We were excited about the quality of art and the thoughtfulness that went into the submissions,” said Dann Carlson, assistant superintendent of the DOE’s Office of School Facilities and Support Services. “It is rewarding to see the project involve students at different levels.”\n\n“Congratulations to the contest winners and all of the students who submitted a design,” said Brian Kealoha, regional manager, OpTerra Energy Services. “The Ka Hei logo will be recognizable for generations as a symbol for sustainability and OpTerra’s innovative partnership with the DOE.”\n\nNoda won a ukulele autographed by Hawaii singer-songwriter Jack Johnson, a home energy monitoring system from Blue Planet Foundation and other items.\n\nThe three runners-up won autographed Jack Johnson CDs, home energy monitoring systems and other items. The ​contest drew entries from 326 students.\n\nThe DOE’s Ka Hei program is a five-year endeavor launched in 2014 that involves renewable energy generation, energy efficient technology to reduce costs and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) curriculum in hands-on learning experiences to provide engaging learning opportunities."
