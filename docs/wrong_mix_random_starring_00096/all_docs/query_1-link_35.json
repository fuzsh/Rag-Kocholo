        "text": "Nine Lives • (1969) • novelette by Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nGood. Two men on a mining station are met with one “person” who is a set of 10 clones - 5 men and 5 women. When a horrible accident occurs, the one remaining close experiences a kind of loneliness that no one else has ever known.\n\nMary • (1964) • novelette by Damon Knight\n\nAverage. A quiet tale of sex, love, occupation, and destiny within a society that is peaceful, but very little can change. One young woman - who might not have been clones quite right - wants more out of her life and love than others are able to provide.\n\nThe Extra • (1990) • novelette by Greg Egan\n\nGreat. The ultra-rich keep clones for spare parts. Physically fit, but mentally handicapped. One man parades them before his friends and then comes up with the idea to transfer his brain and consciousness instead of just harvesting body parts.\n\nOut of Copyright • (1989) • short story by Charles Sheffield\n\nGood. Corporations clone the greatest scientists and thinkers from all of recent history after their family’s copyright runs out. It is very similar to a sports draft.\n\nThe Phantom of Kansas • (1976) • novelette by John Varley\n\nGreat. For some people who live beneath the surface of Luna, immortality is assured by banks that will rebuild a clone of you and fill it with your memories on file. Our protagonist, a creator of ‘environmental experiences’ awakens to find that she is the 4th recent rebirth because she’s been murdered three times. With the help of the Central Computer, a policewoman, and her memories, she tries to hunt down the killer. A wonderful science fiction mystery that plays fair within a very interesting future world.\n\nBlood Sisters • (1979) • novelette by Joe Haldeman\n\nGood. SciFi Film Noir cheese. A sexy damsel in distress clone walks into the private detective’s office. She has a problem with the Mafia and needs his protection. Sex. Clones with giant guns. Explosions! All the fun stuff.\n\nPast Magic • (1990) • short story by Ian R. MacLeod\n\nGreat. A man visits his ex-wife who is living on a island kept safe from the rest of the collapsing society by extreme wealth. She has cloned a replacement of their young daughter who died in a boating accident. In order to recapture the memories of the daughter, the ex-wife wants something that the man may not be able to give.\n\nClone Sister • (1973) • novelette by Pamela Sargent\n\nAverage. Clone sexual melodrama. When his girlfriend leaves him, one clone deals with relationships, individuality, and quite a bit of depression.\n\nWhere Late the Sweet Birds Sang • (1974) • novella by Kate Wilhelm\n\nGreat. The world is ravaged by pollution, pandemics, chaos, violence, and infertility. One family hides themselves away in a bunker and surreptitiously creates a generation of clones as the only hope of keeping humanity alive. When the clone generation comes of age, they are culturally different than anyone expected. An absolute masterpiece with living characters, a terrifyingly plausible vision of dystopia, and smart storytelling at every step of the plot."
