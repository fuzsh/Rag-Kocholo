        "text": "Microsoft Partner of the Year Award 2024 🎖 Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending the Microsoft Partner of the Year Award Ceremony hosted by Microsoft Switzerland at The Circle. In a relaxed #atmosphere, the top Swiss Microsoft Customer References were celebrated. We are pretty proud and humbled to have made it to the finals in both the #Azure and #BusinessApplications categories. Although we narrowly missed out on winning, it was a privilege to #compete and #witness other #exceptional customer cases from other partners win the top spot. Congratulations to all the Winners and all the other Finalists! A big thank you to Microsoft (Catrin, Andrew, Martin,Beat, Rene, Nadine, Jasmin, Mia, Natasa, Katia, Roger and many more) for organizing this great event and for the nice Apéro/Dinner at Sablier Rooftop Restaurant & Bar. It was also pretty cool to reconnect and exchange again with other Microsoft partners in the community 😊 Stefan, Christian, Fabrizio, Pascal, Gerardo, Max Lastly, a #BIG thanks to our own isolutions AG Crew. Your daily #dedication, #passion and #customerobsession ensures that we consistently achieve such #successful, #referable customer cases across #CRM, #Azure, #AI, #CloudInfra and #CoPilot environments. Thank you! 🙏\n\n#Grateful, #Fulfilled, and #Proud 💫 ! The TGV train ride from Paris to Zurich is the perfect time to reflect on the amazing past few days. The emotional arrival of over 2,100 riders at the prestigious #Vélodrome Jacques Anquetil in Paris was the highlight and the crowning glory of the Team Rynkeby Zürich 2024 campaign. A Lot of relatives, supporters and sponsors had arrived, and the #atmosphere was fantastic. At the finish line, we celebrated, exchanged shirts and news between different teams and compared amazing experiences along the way. It was just great 🙏 ✨ I am #grateful for the opportunity to spend a week of my life surrounded by amazing people, experiencing so much, and learning even more. ✨ I am #fulfilled knowing that the Swiss team once again contributed a significant amount of donations to help children in need. ✨ I am #proud that we were able to #significantly increase the donations compared to last year, thanks to the #passion and #dedication, of every team member, both #riders and the #supportteam. The #registration for the 2025 Rynkeby campaign is open until #August31th. How about joining TeamRynkeby in 2025?
