        "text": "I felt this post deserved more attention than what it probably would\n\ngotten had it not been brought to everyones attention:\n\nDig the following:\n\nFrom: od...@dcs.qmw.ac.uk (Andrew George Elia)\n\nNewsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.advocacy\n\nSubject: Fight for them Amigas!\n\nDate: 28 Sep 1995 10:34:47 GMT\n\nHi guys!\n\nIt`s about time we started to give Escom (not necesarrily AT) a\n\ngood kicking.\n\nI have been working in one of the Escom stores for the past four\n\nmonths with the hope that I would be participating in some way towards\n\nthe re-introduction of the Amiga. If nothing else, I might be able to do\n\nsomething from the inside or even get a staff discount. It seems that I\n\nassumed that Escom UK would be just as willing to welcome back the Amiga\n\nas the German parent company. Big mistake.\n\nWhen I first applied for the job, I was asked to sit a test which\n\ncontained things about memory access times, and IRQ values. When I got\n\nthe job I would have had to go to a training session led by reps from\n\nIntel, and IBM. I didn`t (couldn`t) go.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have contacted every single department\n\nin our head office, and they don`t know a thing! In fact, some of them\n\ntried to tell me that Escom bought the name and ditched the rest.\n\nThe reason that I am inflicting this on you all is that Amiga\n\nShopper and Amiga Format (November issues in each case) state that Amiga\n\nTechnologies have told them that Escom stores WILL be selling Amigas. I\n\ncontacted a certain person in AT, and he informed me that this would not\n\nbe the case because negotiations with Escom had failed. You may or may\n\nnot know that both Intel and IBM have pumped a hell of a lot of money\n\ninto the new Escom stores. I have a feeling that they have objected to\n\nhaving Amigas in the stores (primarily because it proves that Intel\n\nprocessors are kludged 70s crap, and IBM have blatantly tried (and\n\nfailed) to copy AmigaDOS/Workbench).\n\nWorringly, AT told Amiga Shopper that the staff in Escom stores\n\nknow the Amiga product well and are ideally suited to selling them. This\n\nis blatantly untrue. Not only do 70% of Escom staff consist of former\n\nRumbelows staff (ie. gormless box shifters), but those that I have spoken\n\nto seem to be quite antagonistic towards Amigas. As for knowing anything\n\nabout them from either a software or hardware point of view, you have to\n\nsee their ignorance to believe it. They REALLY don`t know what they are\n\nselling. This seems to apply to the 30% of new staff who are wholly PC\n\nnerds. The branches I have talked to confirm that they get tonnes of\n\nAmiga enquiries. I have found out from the Amiga Format letters page from\n\nOctober (I think) that some shops have been denying that they had\n\nanything to do with Amigas all along. In fact my own collegues drop\n\ncustomers like hot potatoes the moment they find out they have Amigas.\n\nFortunately, if a customer hasn`t already left the shop (some do so\n\nwithout bothering to ask -unsurprising considering the response they\n\nothers give) I put the record straight.\n\nBasically, I think it`s suicide for Escom stores not to deal in\n\nAmigas, their software and hardware. Although Escom and AT want\n\nthemselves to be considered separate entities, the link has already been\n\nestablished. If the public can`t SEE Amigas, they will find it more\n\ndifficult to make a decision about buying one. For goodness sake, if you\n\nare near an Escom store, don`t be afraid to go in and ASK about them. If\n\nthey give you the wrong answer, put them straight. Don`t let them give\n\nyou any rubbish about what they think is happening. They simply don`t know.\n\nI have to confess that I hold a relatively menial position at\n\nEscom (higher only than the window clear and the guy that collects the\n\nrubbish bins). As such I am trying to get some management staff to back\n\nme up. I`ve already compilied a survey which I`m planning on faxing over\n\nto every store in London (and elsewhere if necessary) to try an\n\naccumulate some evidence of demand for Amigas in Escom stores. I just\n\nhave to wait for managerial approval.\n\nBy the way. If it is true that AT are ditching the AAA chipset,\n\nthey should get their heads examined. Another thing: AmigaDOS is for the\n\nAmiga, so why the hell do they want to develop it for machines with a\n\nmore limited architecture ? Here`s an idea: why not develop AmigaDOS for\n\nthe Amiga ? Smart people.\n\nI challenge anyone from either Escom or Amiga Technologies to prove what I`ve said is\n\nwrong. I hope I am. I HAVE sent E-Mail to Gilles Bourdin twice, and had no reply.\n\nAndrew Elia\n\n(Escom UK)\n\nPS. Someone please shoot Mojo from Foundation Imaging and put him out of\n\nhis misery. He has been brainwashed by Intel. Read November`s Amiga\n\nShopper and you`ll know what I mean.\n\n--\n\nTick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock*click*.\n\n+-+----------------------------------------------------------------p-+-q\n\n|O| Signature v1.15b |o|O|\n\n+-+----------------------------------------------------------------b-+-d\n\n| |\n\n| Im a whiz-kid of the Superinformation Highway!

Bite me.)\n\nIn article <44ej2b$3...@nntp.interaccess.com> b...@thymaster.interaccess.com (J. Poag) writes:\n\nHmm, I feel the subject line is not appropriate, since Escom never\n\nofficially promised to sell Amigas through Escom stores. In fact they (or\n\nAT) said they *wouldn't*.\n\nApart from that, I went to one local Escom store (here in the Netherlands)\n\nand asked about the Amiga. The salesman I talked to told me that they had\n\nan internal 'press release' from management telling them they would start\n\nselling Amigas in September. That was about two weeks ago. I haven't looked\n\nyet, but beginning of October I'm going to have a look whether it's true.\n\n(The wild rumour of every Escom store already having A4000T's behind their\n\ncounters is obviously untrue).\n\nI then asked about what models they would be selling, he said he didn't\n\nknow, but probably the 1200 and the 400 (yes he said 400, not 4000. I\n\ncorrected him :) I also asked whether he or any other representative in the\n\nstore had experience with Amigas, whether they have had any training, or\n\nwould be getting any on the subject of Amigas, to which he replied with no,\n\nno and don't know. I asked why they didn't know or aren't going to know\n\nanything about the Amiga to which he replied that he is not a technician,\n\nhe only sells the stuff.\n\nSo my conclusions are: his reactions were pretty normal (he was actually\n\nquite friendly and informative as it goes), these people don't know much\n\nabout Amigas and computers in general, they are salesmen and are usually\n\nhired on the base of some little knowledge (like being able to install\n\nsoftware and knowing something about upgrading) and I guess a\n\n'representable' looks/consumer friendliness. Nothing new there.\n\nApart from that, the fact that he heard something about the Amiga from\n\nmanagement tells me they *are* going to sell them. How soon and in what way\n\n(probably not a prominent corner) remains to be seen. Judging from the way\n\nthe shop window was plastered with Win95 logo's I'd say they are heavily MS\n\ninfluenced and regard the Amiga not as something with a high priority.\n\nThe haze surrounding AT, Escom and their relationship can also be\n\nexplained by a purposeful radiosilence before the attack. Be sure that\n\nsomewhere there are people all over the industry watching what's happening\n\nto the Amiga. It's a cutthroat business and a new (hah) competitor with\n\nsuch potential is not to be discounted.\n\nAT is doing their best and should be left alone for the moment, they\n\nhaven't screwed up big time yet, it's only been a couple of months since\n\nthe auction. Although, as always, things could be done better, within the\n\nframe of what's possible regarding manpower and financial backing from the\n\nparent company, I think they haven't done that badly up to now. So, hold your\n\nbreath :) (and your flames) I think (hope) that there is significantly more\n\nhappening behind the screens than we hear about. Ideally they have by now\n\ndecided what RISC platform AmigaDOS 4.x is going to be developed for and\n\nare secretly hiring engineers as not to alert the competition. The pessimist\n\nin me says they are waiting for the Christmas season's results and decide\n\nwhether to ditch the Amiga or commit themselves to it *after* that. Or rather,\n\nEscom are waiting for AT's results and decide whether they are going to\n\ngive them financial backing or not.\n\n> [..] Another thing: AmigaDOS is for the\n\n> Amiga, so why the hell do they want to develop it for machines with a\n\n> more limited architecture ? Here`s an idea: why not develop AmigaDOS for\n\n> the Amiga ? Smart people.\n\nActually, *AmigaDOS* is the Amiga, not the hardware. It would not be a bad\n\nthing to finally abandon the custom chip architecture and move towards\n\nindustry standard (i.e. cheap) parts. AAA doesn't cut it anymore. Proprietary,\n\nexpensive and already outdated. I couldn't care less on what platform AmigaDOS\n\nruns as long as it stays _AmigaDOS_ (and there's a reasonably fast 680x0\n\nemulation available for old software that hasn't been ported yet). PPC & PCI\n\nwould be best IMHO.\n\n> [..] I HAVE sent E-Mail to Gilles Bourdin twice, and had no reply.\n\nHe's a busy man, can't answer everyone with a gripe :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThomas Tavoly + A4000 = tta...@amiga.ow.nl | tta...@cistron.nl _\n\n-I'm in therapy for Chronic Windows Defenestration Syndrome.._ //\n\n---------------------------------------------- [.sig v3.1pl9] -\\X/-\n\n-- snip --\n\n: : You should remember, that they had to start the production over, not just to\n\n: : continue.

That would be\n\n: simple (hell, I could probably do it myself) and it would increase performance\n\n: and free up the expansion port.\n\nI think they were stupid for not making some minor changes such as that\n\nin the system before they tooled up to produce the machines. I bet they\n\ncould have contracted out to some of the ex-Commodore engineers to do\n\nsome minor changes before they went into production. I think that much\n\nof the Amiga community would have been reassured to hear that some\n\nchanges were being made by some of the ex-C= engineers before production\n\nstarted. I'm sure that most changes would have only takes a couple of\n\nweeks to finish.\n\nBack in June, I suggested to Dr Kittel that they should make some minor\n\nchanges like what you mentioned above and also the addition of a SCSI\n\ninterface to the system at the expense of the built in RF modulator and\n\npossibly replacing the external floppy connector with a 25pin SCSI\n\nconnector but they could have used the knock out panel for it. Either\n\nthey just desided to ignore that people wanted some minor changes or they\n\nused old molds and whatever to build the machines.\n\nIf they didn't want to put a SCSI 2 controller on it, they could have\n\ngone with the same SCSI hardware and software that's in the 3000. I\n\nbet it wouldn't have taken a few hours for someone to make the changes\n\non the board designs in some board designing software. They would have\n\nmade some money off of existing A1200 owners that wanted to get a new\n\nmotherboard.\n\nChris Hall\n\nma...@sandman.iaehv.nl (Keurentjes) wrote:\n\n>> >Who is this market that want 2M 1200's with 170M hard drives?\n\n>> >It is not me, or people of my nature, I deem.\n\n>>\n\n>> Then you obviously aren't representative.

But Dr Kittel probably wouldn`t agree as it`d cost more than\n\n400UK pounds. BTW, Dr. Kittel. If you are going for a chip clocked at\n\n25Mhz-28Mhz, use an EC020 instead, it`s cheaper and gives users more of a\n\nreason to upgrade to the 50Mhz 030 from an 020 than from another 030. Unless\n\nA1200/040 accelerators are going to become common.\n\n> - Support in the Alice for either Chunky or Planar screens....\n\nCould maybe use a DSP for this.

(coder's gripe... :)\n\n> - Perhaps you could also consider an 040 chip for those couple of quids extra?\n\nGood idea but Dr Kittel probably can`t sell it for under 400 UK pounds then.\n\nAs long as Dr. Kittel is reading this...\n\nI was just about ready to trade my A1200 w/204M hard disk, memory, HD\n\nfloppy, etc. blah blah in on a new Pentium with Windows '95. Why you\n\nask? (I hope)\n\nBecause not only do we not have compatible import/export of MS\n\nWord/WordPerfect/AmiPro/Excel (or at least RTF), we don't have a decently\n\nusable WWW/Internet package. I have been spending the better part of the\n\nlast week screwing with AmiTCP, Mlink, and AMosaic, trying to get some\n\ncombination of the above to do something.

Fortuneately, another amiga user at my\n\nuniversity has been helping me out via email, otherwise I would just give\n\nup and trade this Amiga in for whatever I could get toward a computer\n\nsystem where the OS developer actively supports the trends in the uses of\n\nthe market.\n\nSo I hope you are going to do more than just \"Look for a `professional\n\npartner'\" in the USA. If you won't be one yourself, then you don't\n\ndeserve anyone wasting there money on an orphan system in this country.\n\nThat means you ought to support people like Softwood over here toward\n\nfunding the programming and licensing for cross-platform compatiblility.\n\nyou ought to be funding the programming and licensing of \"Internet in a\n\nbox\" for the Amiga, with ready-to-use programs and phone-numbers to dial\n\nin to, as well as Dial-In sript writers, suggestions etc.\n\nThese are all projects that shareware/PD authors are working on.
