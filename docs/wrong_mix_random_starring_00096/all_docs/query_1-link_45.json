        "text": "Delays!Â Due to the fact that The Outskirter’s Secret is significantly longer than The Steerswoman.Â Thought I could use the same format, and just paste in the different text and cover, but nope.Â Had to move to a larger size.\n\nRequiring lots of other adjustments.Â And errors. And fixes. And more adjustments.Â And now I am behind schedule, and so must scramble.\n\nAh, remember the good ol’ days when I was traditionally published (by Random House/Ballantine/Del Rey)?Â They had people to do all this!\n\nOh, right.Â The books went out of print.Â That’s why it’s all in my hands now.\n\nWell, y0u know, I actually do enjoy it. I’m arty, I’m nerdy, I’m tech-savvy — this taps my other skills.Â And when the current story itself is being recalcitrant, at least here’s a task that succumbs to dogged determination.\n\nBut if I want them available by Christmas, I’d better get going!\n\nMy pal Geary Gravel is continuing the re-release of his early novels, so you can keep catching up on what you’ve missed of his ourvre so far.\n\nThe latest title to return is Return of the Breakneck Boys, Book 2 of the Fading Worlds series.Â The tale picks up where A Key for the Nonesuch left off, with ourÂ protagonist, unheroic normal-guyÂ Howard Bell (previously dropped willy-nilly into the middle of deadly alien war-games), now the leader of his very own battle-gang, and planning an insurrection against the mysterious organizers of the forced wars.Â And in pursuit of that end, Howard and his warrior-woman partner Alaya must leave the Burroughs-esque enviroments of the Fading Worlds wars, and head to —\n\nUm. Earth.\n\nThe Fading Worlds series is a lot of fun, and a good turnaround of genre tropes about mighty Earthmen battling foes on barbaric alien worlds.Â Things are not quite what they seem, and Geary handles it all with wit and grace. AndÂ I really do enjoy Howard Bell as a character — I always sort of envision him played by Tom Hanks.\n\nCover by illustrator Cortney Skinner, who has known Geary for nearly as long as they’ve both been alive.\n\nIn other news not about me…\n\nThe World Fantasy Awards were announced last week.\n\nThe winners were:\n\nNovel: The Sudden Appearance of Hope, Claire North (Redhook; Orbit UK)\n\nLong fiction: The Dream-Quest of Vellitt Boe, Kij Johnson (Tor.com Publishing)\n\nShort Fiction: â€œDas SteingeschÃ¶pf,â€ G.V. Anderson (Strange HorizonsÂ 12/12/16)\n\nAnthology:Â Dreaming in the Dark, Jack Dann, ed. (PS Australia)\n\nCollection: A Natural History of Hell, Jeffrey Ford (Small Beer)\n\nFor the full list, pop over to Tor.com (an excellent source for SF/F news, info and free reads).Â Or go right to the World Fantasy Convention website.\n\n(I’ll get to the post about my local library next — but I wanted to get the news out about Geary’s book ASAP.Â To allow you that much more time before Christmas to buy it.Â You’re welcome.)\n\n— a coffee-stained copy of Mary Oliver’s Upstream.\n\nOh, and a cool tote from the Wallingford Library.\n\nThe library itself is now the proud possessor of a check from me for a brand-new copy of Mary Oliver’s Upstream. And a tote.\n\nYep.Â There was a book, a cup of coffee, a slightly rickety table in the woods, and my elbow.Â All four met in unfortunate circumstance.Â I have to blame the elbow; there’s just no other explanation.\n\nI bought the tote because I felt that the library was not charging me enough for replacing the book.Â I wanted to give them more money, to assuage my vast guilt.\n\nOn the upside, I now own the book. Plus: hey, tote!\n\nIn other news:\n\nNow that the third floor is nearly as deserted in the day as it is at night, I’ve taken to pacing the hall as I think.Â Last night, as I paced past the conference room, I once again admired their gigantic dry-erase whiteboard.Â And by “admired” I mean “seethed with envy over.”\n\nIn my own office, I’ve tacked up hugeÂ sheets of dry-erase-style contact paper, to allow me to scrawl deep thoughts and work through twisty structural problems in multiple colors.Â At least, in theory that’s why it’s there.Â But alas, the contact paper does not work as well as an actual whiteboard.Â Â While it’s true that I can write on it, and erase it,Â I can only dry-erase in a 10-second window.Â After that, I have to spray on an ammonia-based solvent and use a sponge.Â This puts a crimp in one’s spontaneity.\n\nAnd as I grumbled to myself, pacing back toward my office, it suddenly hit me:\n\nI work at night.Â There’s nobody here!\n\nSo, I made a big pot of tea, grabbed my laptop and my dry-erase markers and:\n\nThe billboard company never technically had exclusive use of the conference room. But it was next to their offices, and they were often gathered in it.Â So, I simply got it in my head that I don’t use the conference room.Â Plus, there’s a whole fishbowl aspect to it, with one glass wall, and its location among all the offices of the sales force.\n\nBut now, they are gone.Â It’s just Dave and me.Â And that one programmer dude who’s never around.\n\nPlus — I work at night.Â Mostly.\n\nThat was the night of the crazy rain and wind.Â Â There’s something particularly lovely about drinking strong tea after midnight, rain and wind banging on the windows, dreaming up crazy solutions to near-intractable problems, while scrawling wildly on 6 by 4 whiteboard.\n\nOf course, lest I take myself too seriously, there was this guy:\n\nHope you enjoyed your Hallowe’en! I did — although I never did make it to the town’s justifiably famous Trail of Terror.Â I’ve always wanted to try it just once… too late now.\n\nNext up: More about the local library, about which not enough good things can be said."
