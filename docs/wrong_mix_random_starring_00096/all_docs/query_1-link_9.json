        "text": "April 1, 2017\n\nI have to admit, I'm primarily a unicorn fan on account of the movie adaption of The Last Unicorn which I have watched many times over the years, and which is firmly entrenched in my collective Assaf-sibling group-consciousness. \"Unicorn! Haggard! Uuuuunicorn!\" Therefore, when a coworker brought in to the office a bunch of books he was ready to part ways with, I snagged it out of a knee-jerk reaction to the unicorn on the cover. This review will be brief by story, as I'm not really obsessed with unicorns (like my leettle seester was) and have more to say at a meta level than at the stories themselves.\n\n\"The Spoor of the Unicorn: An Adventure in Unhistory\" by Avram Davidson, 1982. This one pretty much nearly killed the entire book for me. Boring, and not sure if it were attempting to be fiction or non-fiction, but then I started reading it out loud in the voice of the Architect from The Matrix, and it was more entertaining. Chances of me seeking out more by Davidson: 5%.\n\n\"The Silken Swift\" by Theodore Sturgeon, 1953. This one got me but only on the 2nd 1/2 read. 1/2 way through I had to go back to beginning and try to figure out what was going on. Which I think was the point: fooling the reader. Clever and also touching. Rainbow scale: 8 out of 10.\n\n\"Eudoric's Unicorn\" by L. Sprague de Camp, 1977. A con man, royalty, trade routes and a unicorn. Ok... kind of odd, but it flowed well. First thing I've read by de Camp. Not really inspired to seek out more. Kind of blah. 5/10 Unis.\n\n\"The Flight of the Horse\" by Larry Niven, 1969. Second writing of Niven's I've read. Most anything would probably be better than the first thing I read by him (so I hear), namely, A World Out of Time, but actually, I kind of liked it. It is a sci-fi story with time travel and unicorns. Not fairies and kingdoms and sorcerers. Unexpectedly charming. Rating: 8/10 gila monsters.\n\n\"On the Downhill Side\" by Harlan Ellison, 1972. Ah Ellison, Star Trek master! And apparently, a New Orleans familiar. Extra points for my home state reference! Vodoo? Magic? Cemeteries? Unicorns? Ghosts? Kind of cool. 70% on the Star Trek/Unicorn Crossover index.\n\n\"The Night of the Unicorn\" by Thomas Burnett Swann, 1975. Touching story. Unicorns shedding their horns as gifts? (Sorry, spoiler alert!) Very clever. I rank it 6 out of 10 kingly gifts.\n\n\"Mythological Beast\" by Stephen R. Donaldson, 1978. I've read his initial Thomas Covenant trilogy but none else of his. So I was expecting dark and depressing. I did get dystopian future and a man who slowly turns into a unicorn. Ok that was surprising. Another sci-fi unicorn story was a welcome addition to the collection. Score: 90% on the Likeliness I'd watch a Soap Opera about this General Hospital Probability scale.\n\n\"The Final Quarry\" by Eric Norden, 1970. Don't hunt unicorns. Didn't these characters read \"The Last Unicorn\"? It doesn't work! 8/10 on the Grizzly Death Scale.\n\n\"Elfleda\" by Vonda N. McIntyre, 1981. I read one of her Star Wars books before. The Crystal Star. It was ok... Kind of bizarre for Star Wars. I should have expected a bit of strangeness. But the copulating satyrs took me by surprise anyway. Rating: B+ on the Probably would have been scandalized if I had read this as a teenager grading scale.\n\n\"The White Donkey\" by Ursula K. Le Guin, 1980. I admit, I've never read Le Guin. I know, how can I call myself a sci-fi fan? But forgetting that, this was 3.14 pages of unicorn story that barely got started before it ended so I read it twice trying to figure out why? (No pie in the story, much less pi, by the way.) No rating, not long enough, just a question: why?\n\n\"Unicorn Variations\" by Roger Zelazny, 1981. I have at least 2 books of his on my shelf in my reading queue. They'd be the first two writings of his if I hadn't read this first. I definitely will be bumping those two books higher into the queue. Shades of The Seventh Seal and The Day The Earth Stood Still here, as a man plays chess with a unicorn (he cheats, naturally) while they drink beer and contemplate the fate of the continued existence of human life on planet Earth. The man tries to convince the unicorn humans are worth keeping around. Guest starring other fantastical creatures in a modern post-apocalyptic setting (which is explained, by the way). Probably my favorite story of the lot. A perfect 10 out of 10 unicorns--or is it 0 out of 10? After all, unicorns can turn invisible, didn't you know?\n\n\"The Sacrifice\" by Gardner Dozois, 1982. Another barely more than 3 page story. Unicorns definitely are stereotypically inclined to lay their heads upon female virgins' laps. Does not disappoint in that regard! A+ on the AEI (Abrupt Ending Index).\n\n\"The Unicorn\" by Frank Owen, 1952. Bittersweet story about a farmer blessed with the aid of a unicorn but is tempted with avarice. Sad song say so much! Are you sure this wasn't a pen name of Stephen Donaldson? Grade: Sad++.\n\n\"The Woman the Unicorn Loved\" by Gene Wolf, 1981. College campuses, unicorn and poetry. Plus epic chase scenes. Curiously enjoyable. Original Thesis Ideas: 1 (but really, you only need one).\n\n\"The Forsaken\" by Beverly G. Evans, 1982. Scam artist village soothsayer find redemption. Or does he? Short and enjoyable. Plus I just love the name \"Finmole.\" No rating, just pondering the meaning of life, and faith.\n\n\"The Unicorn\" by T. H. White, 1939, 1940, 1958. Any story with three years must be good, right? Nope. This was terrible. I hope he had better success with his larger Arthurian Legend stories. This one felt like Lord of the Flies meets The Godfather. Ok that sounds actually like an interesting movie. But this was just disturbing. Rating: F+. It only gets a + because I kept hoping for a cameo by King Arthur and that was enough to make me finish it.\n\nSo there you have it. Fantasy, modern and sci-fi stories about unicorns. Took me a while to read it, and probably I'm better off for having read it. But... likely I'll donate the book so some other unsuspecting unicorn fan can try it on for size. Not sure I'll ever want to read through those stories again. (Except maybe the beer guzzling chess playing unicorn story. That was fun.)\n\nMarch 29, 2016\n\nAn excellent collection with a lot of variety in theme, tone, setting, etc. Has two of my favorite unicorn stories: The Silken-Swift by Theodore Sturgeon and Mythological Beast by Stephen R. Donaldson (\"YOU ARE NOT OK. YOU ARE NOT OK.\")\n\nJanuary 14, 2022\n\nThis compilation is full of stories by noted authors such as Theodore Sturgeon, Larry Niven, Stephen R. Donaldson, Vonda N. McIntyre, and Ursula K. Le Guin, so although well written, most of them are on the light and fluffy side. Here are some of the highlights.\n\n“On the Downhill Side” by Harlan Ellison (Universe 2, 1972 - short story)\n\n1973 Nebula Award finalist\n\n4 Stars\n\nAfter years together, a dead man's unicorn companion helps him find salvation. Minor Ellison, perhaps, but it has an emotional punch.\n\n“Unicorn Variation” by Roger Zelazny (Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, April 1981 - novelette)\n\n1982 Hugo Award winner\n\n3 Stars\n\nA man plays chess with a unicorn to save humanity from extinction. The man uses a sasquatch to coach him. The whole thing is played fairly lightly; it must have been somewhat of a lean year for novelettes for this to win the Hugo Award.\n\n“The Woman the Unicorn Loved” by Gene Wolfe (Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, June 1981 - short story)\n\n1982 Hugo Award finalist\n\n3 Stars\n\nA unicorn turns up on a modern college campus, possibly the result of an unknown biology experiment. A young woman is able to get the unicorn to safety before the military or other agency arrives, but things don't go completely according to plan.\n\n“The Unicorn” by T. H. White (excerpt from The Once and Future King, 1939 - short story)\n\n3 Stars\n\nSome of King Arthur's knights get the notion to go hunting for a unicorn, and upon finding one completely botch things up. This is supposed to be humorous or ironic, but it's mostly just kind of dark and grisly.\n\nAugust 16, 2020\n\nWhen I picked this up my expectations were through the roof. Reading the list of authors who had contributed short stories to this collection it was a veritable \"Who's who\" of fantasy writers. What could go wrong?\n\nWhere do I begin? Let's start with the far too often the same applications to unicorns seen in the vast majority of the stories. All white, flowing manes, spiral horns, cloven feet, lion's tail, shy, magical healing, and always laying their heads in a maiden's lap. Yesh! A little variety, please.\n\nThen there are the actual stories themselves. Bland, bland, bland! Yes, there were exceptions. My favorites were UNICORN VARIATION by Roger Zelazny and THE FLIGHT OF THE HORSE by Larry Niven. Good stories both, but 5 stars? Nope. They were 4's.\n\nThat means everything else in the book I would rate at 3 stars or less. Normally, when I review a collection of short stories I go to the effort of rating each story separately, but in this case, due to the all too familiar storylines in so many, I can't be bothered.\n\nWhen a collection cannot provide, in my mind, a single short worthy of a 5-star review then the whole thing gets downgraded despite a 3-star average. Hence, my rating of 2 stars.\n\nJune 21, 2021\n\n0/5 - The Spoor of the Unicorn, by Avram Davidson\n\n1/5 - The Silken Swift, by Theodore Sturgeon\n\n2/5 - Eudoric's Unicorn, by L. Sprague de Camp\n\n2/5 - The Flight of the Horse, by Larry Niven\n\n2/5 - The Night of the Unicorn, by Thomas Burnett Swann\n\n2/5 - Mythological Beast, by Stephen R.

White\n\nApril 13, 2020\n\nI didn't read the whole book, but I enjoyed Zelazny's, Donaldson's, and Niven's stories! And, of course, Le Guin's, which I'd previously read in a Le Guin anthology.\n\nThe others I read were pretty... symptomatic of fantasy/scifi of the time.\n\nJanuary 31, 2021\n\nAn interesting collection of short stories. I enjoyed several of them, while others were very weird and some made no sense. Some were very old fashioned style of writing, making them harder to understand.\n\nDecember 2, 2022\n\nXlkx\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJuly 13, 2024\n\nThis was the first anthology of unicorn stories I ever read, and it spoiled me for any other unicorn story collections. Really, this is the only unicorn anthology you will ever need, as long as you're an adult.\n\nI bought a paperback as soon as it was available in the mall's bookstore. That really dates me, I know. I guess I was about 12. I was raised a Born Again Christian and was currently attending a strict Christian school. I was a virgin's virgin.\n\nSo, imagine how wide my eyes got when reading \"Elfleda\".\n\nRight away, I knew I had to hide this book. My parents would open and read any of my books at random when my back was turned. If they did find it and read it, they probably assumed that I didn't understand what was going on.\n\nDecades later, \"Elfleda\" remains the kinkiest story I have ever read.\n\nKink aside, there are real classics in here from veteran sci-fi and fantasy writers, such as the oft-antholigized \"The Flight of the Horse\" by Larry Niven and the also oft-anthologized \"Unicorn Variation\" by Roger Zelazny. I love the idea of a talking, chess-playing unicorn. \"The Silken Swift\" is not only a great unicorn story, but a killer fantasy story.\n\nMy favorite was \"Mythological Beast\" by Stephen R. Donaldson. I read that story so many times, I had it practically memorized. When I was homeless in England, I would recite this story to my crazy boyfriend and his friends when conversation came to a standstill.\n\nThe very first selection, \"The Spoor of the Unicorn\" is not a story, but a parody of The Lore of the Unicorn by Odell Shepherd. Since I'd read Shepherd's monster, I thought the parody was brilliant, but it will probably be baffling for those not familiar with that book.\n\nMay 9, 2014\n\nAs usual, there are no spoilers in this review.\n\nI read this book in 1983. It is now 2014. In 31 years, I've never forgotten this book. Well, actually, there is one story in this anthology of unicorn stories that will always be with me because of its timeless beauty and universal truth.\n\nIt is The Silken-Swift by Theodore Sturgeon.\n\nIf you like seeing goodness and light triumph over darkness and evil, read this story. There are no cliches, no tired moralities. Just a beautiful story that shows what a masterful writer can do with pen and ink. This is one story that I will remember until I'm gone from this earth.\n\nThis story (and book) is for readers of all ages. I've read some reviews that mention how the cover looks like it was designed for a preadolescent girl. Maybe it was, but the stories weren't.\n\nI'm sorry to say that I don't remember any of the other stories in this anthology. Isn't that how it so often is with anthologies? Some stories shine like diamonds, others not so much. It isn't because those other stories were not good, it is because Sturgeon's story was so good it completely buried the others, at least for me.\n\nListen to how much praise I'm heaping on this story! I'll bet the first person to read it will wonder what all the fuss was about. All I can say is that beyond a certain point, no matter how well-written a story is, personal taste is what decides the fate of the story, and personally, I'm wild about this story.\n\nI hope my words will encourage someone to seek out this anthology, perhaps on Amazon, or maybe interlibrary loan. It is an old book, but some library somewhere must still have it.\n\nGood hunting.\n\nDecember 3, 2012\n\nMost of the stories in this anthology were really quite good, but as with most anthologies, some were much better then others.\n\nI'm sorry to say that what I consider to be the worst story in this collection is the first, \"The Spoor of The Unicorn.\" It was, quite frankly, extremely strange. It was like an entry from an very confused encyclopedia, making weird connections and bringing up points only for the author to say \"(I'm making this up, for pity's sake! Don't quote me.)\" OR to simply move on with out explaining what a tangent on speech therapy has to do with Unicorns.\n\nAnd while that was the most disappointing, some of the others were strange, moving farther into Sci-fi then one would expect. Some of these, particularly Vonda N. McIntyre's \"Elfeda,\" were quite good, where others, like Larry Niven's \"The Flight of the Horse\" were so caught up in the science aspects that the unicorn felt over-looked.\n\nOf course, there were others that stuck to a more traditional unicorn story, such as Theodore Sturgeon's \"Silken Swift\" (which was marvelous) and Bev Evans \"The Forsaken\" (which was... interesting?).\n\nOverall, I do recommend picking up a copy if you manage to come across one, but I also highly recommend skipping the first story.\n\nNovember 21, 2012\n\nDespite a cutesy and dated cover that made a nearly 40 year old man feel like a 12 year old girl, Unicorns! contains some short stories by some of the better science fiction writers of the late seventies, and some progressive and futuristic storylines to accompany such forward thinking minds.\n\nFear not, there are also cute, funny and noble stories about the mythical beast told in a more traditional setting, although those held my interest less. Sturgeon's bizarre essay at the forefront of the collection will throw off the lovers of classic fantasy, which is probably the intent of the editors. Don't seek this book out, but if it stumbles upon your path, it is recommended to let the Unicorn lay his horn in your lap.\n\nFebruary 10, 2012\n\nPretty much every story in this collection is just bad. The Harlan Ellison one is okay. Lots of moralistic BS and \"loss of innocence\" stuff and pedestal-putting of women, of course. Also a very ugh rape story.\n\nI had this one on my shelf largely because I remember reading it as a kid, or one much like it, though now I'm not so sure this is the same collection. The Stephen R. Donaldson story \"Mythological Beast\" is one I remember reading in a collection I'd gotten from the library, and is notable largely because it triggered one of my earliest experiences of déjà vu.\n\nMarch 5, 2009\n\nThis anthology wasn’t as great as expected it to be, but it had been pretty good. I had enjoyed reading it, at least most of it. Even without my bias to unicorns, I believe I would still have liked this book.\n\n~ Complete Review @ My Blog\n\nFebruary 15, 2012\n\nI actually read a book called unicorns by Lucille Recht Penner, but couldn't find it on goodreads. The book I read was more of an outlook on different cultures and what unicorns mean to each culture specifically. It was different than I expected, but somewhat informational and interesting.\n\nAugust 4, 2014\n\nIt is interesting that some of those anthologies work pretty well (Robots, also Armageddons as far as I remember, and some others). But it is as if almost no one can do an interesting story about a unicorn.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 19, 2016\n\nI read this over 15 years ago and recently pulled it out to read again. Now my 2-year-old daughter is obsessed with the book and keeps asking me to read aloud to her from it about \"p-unicorns\" whenever I am putting her to bed or down for a nap.\n\nNovember 5, 2016\n\nIf you're interested in fictional unicorns, as opposed those dry academic accounts of Gestation, Incubation, and Longevity of the species, etc, that one gets in modern naturalist volumes, this is the book for you.\n\nJuly 16, 2012\n\nA few very bad stories, but also some very good stories, especially the Once and Future King excerpt and the story about a man playing chess against a unicorn for the fate of humanity (yes, really)."
