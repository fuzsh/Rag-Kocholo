        "text": "Well, circumstances and very odd hours have put me in a mental state not up to writing up new posts. Oddly, they have not kept me from reading a lot of Raymond Chandler.\n\nAnyway, I’m diving in the archives again.\n\nMPorcius Fiction Log, for over a year, has been looking at the selections of writer and editor Judith Merrill for her various best-of-the-year anthologies. He seems to have had mixed feelings about her selections, but then he selected earlier volumes than this one.\n\nBased on this one, I will not be seeking out any more Merrill selections any time soon.\n\nNow reviewers — amateurs and pros alike — usually like to pretend only what they read affected their review. Well, lots of things besides what’s on the page affect a review. How physically healthy was the reviewer? How intoxicated? How distracted they were by other events in their life when they read a book. And I was definitely distracted in 2009 — so far, the worst year of my life.\n\nBut I don’t think the latter affected the sourness of this review.\n\nRaw Feed (2009): SF 12, ed. Judith Merril, 1968.\n\n“Introduction”, Judith Merrill — Does any state of the art, aesthetic essay sounds as musty and stale and silly as those written in the sixties? Sure, they all make bad predictions and all are dated, but the ones from the sixties sound especially dated. Here Merril does the usual 60s’ rhapsodizing about how fiction must evolve (with lots of allusions to R. D. Laing and Marshall McLuhan – two cult intellectuals of the time) to compete with cinema. That evolution, naturally, is fabulation – a turning away from realism, and sf is part of that movement. Needless to say, it didn’t happen that way. And, of course, the usual predictions about how the mainstream and sf were going to merge didn’t pan out.\n\n“Narrow Valley”, R. A. Lafferty – As you would expect from Lafferty, a humorous story about a bit of haphazard Indian magic (the various Indians can never remember the magic words but their sincerity seems to make a variety work) rendering a bit of unclaimed Oklahoma territory narrow to the naked eye (a half mile wide valley shrinks to seemingly eight feet in width). Lafferty gets some humor out of the topological consequences of this and the annoying family that shows up to claim the land from its Indian inhabitant.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAnd we continue with the Joe Haldeman series, in this an anthology he appeared in.\n\nRaw Feed (2001): Space Soldiers, eds. Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois, 2001.\n\n“Preface“, Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois — A perfunctory introduction to the anthology and the general theme of combat in space.\n\n“The Gardens of Saturn“, Paul J. McAuley — This is another of McAuley’s Quite War series (so-called because the conflict between Outer System colonists and the Three Powers Alliance of Earth is less overt warfare and more sabotage, espionage, and propaganda). It’s not totally clear if it takes place before or after McAuley’s “Reef”. The evidence seems to be before. The scientist Sri Hong-Owen is rumored to have set up an illegal experiment in accelerated evolution in the Kuiper Belt for the Democratic Union of China. That experiment sounds an awful lot like the site explored in “Reef”; Hong-Owen is not mentioned in that story, but, of course, the events of that story confirm rumors of such an experiment. This story seems to take place at least 17 years after the end of the Quite War. The events of “Reef” take place more than 45 years after the end of the Quite War. Just as “Reef” involves the unpleasant social controls and milieu its contract scientists must work under, this story also, ultimately, revolves around issues of social control and, like “Reef”, evolution. At first, though, it has the flavor of film noir with its good-natured protagonist (if amnesiac after being extensively rebuilt), veteran Baker meeting the attractive, but down-and-out fellow veteran, Colonel Vera Flamillion Jackson. But she turns out to have a darker past than we first think. Not only is she a prostitute to the remittance man son of Hong-Owen, a very obese and rather simple man, but she has also been a convict. Like the femme fatales of film noir, she proposes a criminal scheme: a reverse kidnapping of her charge, Berry, and bringing him back to Hong-Owen’s base on an asteroid orbiting Saturn. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Baker doesn’t really trust Jackson. He also refuses, during sex, to link his updated neural system (updated after he was recovered from drifting 15 years after an incident in the Quiet War) to hers. Baker looks upon Jackson as a pathetic individual who refuses to see the necessity to evolve by having her body further modified. When encountering Hong-Owen, Jackson’s plans fall apart, and she is killed. It is revealed that Hong-Owen is engineering people and herself to be something new in evolution: a consciousness that remains, surviving in various bodies including the mold-like being she has become that is filling the asteroid Epimetheus. Hong-Owen’s “clade” will remake themselves into a thousand forms to inhabit many environmental niches. Eventually, (recapitulating the theme of exploitation in “Reef”), Baker is forcibly given an implant by the clade which renders him a member, in a different form, of the clade but still absolutely loyal to it and Hong-Owen’s son, Berry. As the clade says, “Evolution is cruel” and that seems the theme of this story. The nagging “sidekick” personality and control system planted in Baker by his collective becomes much more controlling when the clade modifies it.\n\n“Soldiers Home“, William Barton — Barton is a poet of despair. In fact, at one point, the narrator even describes a scene and says “They write poems about this stuff.” This seems, given the mention of allomorph and the ARM Corporation, to be set in the same universe as Barton’s “Heart of Glass” and When We Were Real though it seems set later than those works since the narrator seems to be one of the last humans left after most were killed after being drafted by the Spinfellows for their war against the Starfish. The narrator returns to a deserted (because all the humans are dead) space colony to seemingly commit suicide. He finds a world inhabited by intelligent tools, mostly weapons from the war — zeppelin-like sharks, intelligent tanks, allomorphs (engineered female surrogates whose sexual services, presence, and conversation were designed to be therapeutic), and silvergirls (intelligent robots). Like the narrator, heavily engineered to be an artilleryman in the war, they are all tools looking for the peace of death. This is a story of existential angst as the narrator fights one last battle which kills the shark, some of the allomorphs, and the intelligent tank. He finds some sort of peace, as much as possible, with an allomorph whose attentions are simply the result of her programming. The story opens with the narrator saying the stars mean nothing, that they are “heaps of meaningless white light”, “an empty stage where we live and die”. And the story ends, after so many tools have been killed, with the narrator once again expressing the notion that he is doing little more than following pointless programming: “You do what you have to do. Because, sometimes all that’s left is life.” Barton is a master of depressing stories narrated in the first person.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhile I work on new stuff, you get a Raw Feed on an anthology with a Joe Haldeman poem in it. Normally, I wouldn’t bother for just a poem, but Haldeman is a very good poet. I have his poetry collection Saul’s Death.\n\nRaw Feed (1989): Blood Is Not Enough: 17 Stories of Vampirism, ed. Ellen Datlow, 1989.\n\n“Introduction“, Ellen Datlow — An introduction tracing, in brief, the evolution of vampire stories from Bram Stoker’s Dracula to second-generation sub-genre pieces in which the authors expect readers to know what vampires are, their strengths and limitations, and play with those conventions to bring issues of ethics and emotions into the sub-genre. Datlow alo makes clear that the anthology is to deal with a broader and much more interesting definition of vampirism: the “draining of energy, the sucking of the will, the life force itself.”\n\n“Carrion Comfort“, Dan Simmons — A story whose chillingness lies more in the philosophy and attitudes of the vampirical characters than in the gruesomeness of the plot. These genteel people who casually, callously use others to perpetrate acts of violent mayhem not just for survival but clearly pleasure. The ambivalent attitude of the narrator Melanie was particularly disturbing. Does she truly think to mend her violent ways out of ethical considerations — even though it will seal her doom — or has she simply tired of Feeding? If the former, the story certainly has her lapsing easily into old, horrible habits with her casual using up of people in her fight with Nina. The willing of the porter to kill himself and two others seems needless reversion to cruelty. For that matter, Melanie did not give up her control of Mr. Thorne after she dropped out of the Game. Perhaps (and probably) his mind was permanently burned out, but control of others and its advantages are hard addictions to break even though Melanie does not exploit a girl but sets her free. In the end, it’s doubtful Melanie will restrain her feeding. Simmons has written a compelling story of the exercise of control and how this is a fantasy we all indulge in occasionally and occasionally bring to life. However, I disagree with him that this is a primary attraction of the vampire story.\n\n“The Sea Was Wet as Wet Could Be“, Gahan Wilson — In this clever story, Gahan Wilson proves he has as much talent as a writer as cartoonist. Wilson effectively brings an edge of horror to Lewis Carroll’s seemingly (at the surface) innocent poem of “The Walrus and the Carpenter”.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIn keeping with looking at what my archives have to say on Frederik Pohl works, here’s a review of an anthology he appeared in.\n\nRaw Feed (2000) Armageddons, eds Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois, 1999.\n\n“Preface”, Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois — Brief introduction to the anthology which talks about the beginnings of apocalyptic sf and how apocalyptic notions once relegated to mostly sf are now common thoughts in the public at large.\n\n“Fermi and Frost”, Frederik Pohl — I’d heard of this story before. It’s relatively famous. Published originally in 1985, I suspect this is one of the sf stories to specifically evoke the idea of “nuclear winter” (though the term is not used). I don’t know how closely Pohl followed the scenario of Carl Sagan and other inventors of the idea of nuclear winter. For instance, I’d never heard of the destructive, soil destroying (via erosion) rains though they logically follow. Pohl chillingly lays out the details of his apocalyptic scenario, adds an interesting beginning where he lays out alternative fates for nine-year-old Timothy Clary – “But that is in fact what did happen!” he says after detailing an alternative where Clary survives (in Iceland which, given its volcanism, actually turns out to be one of the better places to survive nuclear war). Pohl adds a wry, cautionary note at story’s end where he details a plot development where man lives, survives, saves “the science and beauty of life” and greets aliens. But the story ends, “At least, one would like to think so.” Fermi is evoked in the title because the death of humanity is a possible answer to the Fermi Paradox. This isn’t a new idea. Carl Sagan proposed self-destruction as a reason why an alien civilization wouldn’t be around to communicate with us. This is a well-told story, but there’s nothing in here to really distinguish it from many another nuclear war story.\n\n“A Desperate Calculus”, Gregory Benford — Gregory Benford had an article in Reason a few years ago very similar to this story (originally published under the name Sterling Blake, a Benford pseudonym I was unaware of). The premise behind both is that a group of environmentalists might decide to cure environmental degradation in the overpopulated, poor Southern hemisphere by introducing plagues. In the article, Benford postulated revived, lethal smallpox. Here, the environmentalists introduce (under cover as medical doctors, amongst other things) a disease that mostly renders women infertile. Mostly, but they’re willing to accept some collateral damage in deaths of the elderly. In both article and story, Benford postulates that the wealthy North won’t exactly rush aid to the South. At story’s end, the North has developed a vaccine against the plague but isn’t going to rush it to the South. In the article, Benford makes it clear he regards this scenario as plausible and probable and disapproves of such nasty tactics. (He, however, is worried about environmental degradation and lessening biodiversity. I’m sure he supports the idea, depicted in this story, of simply sweeping huge amounts of organisms in the threatened areas of the South and freezing them for possible DNA resurrection.) The morality of the story is much less clear (possibly because the plague is not intended to be lethal). The tone is more matter of fact and not moralizing, and much of the tale seems to be an exchange of letters between lovers Todd (working in the Bio-Salvage Program) and Amy (an epidemiologist) about their work against the backdrop of a spreading superflu. It is only at the end of the tale that we find out they are carriers of the superflu and that their correspondence is part of the coded communication of a conspiracy of about a 100. In the unlikely event that future bioterrorists are lacking in imagination, modern sf has provided a lot of plausible ideas – including this one – to try.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAnd so, on the occasion of the Weird Tradition taking up discussion of this story, I return – reluctantly – to Fritz Leiber’s Fafhrd and Gray Mouser series.\n\nAs it turns out, I go a long way back with this story. It was in the book that exposed me to sword-and-sorcery, Flashing Swords #1. I didn’t feel any need to immediately follow up with any of the authors in that book, though, later I did become a fan of Poul Anderson. Now, Flashing Swords #2 . . . I immediately sought out Michael Moorcock’s Elric series after coming across it there.\n\nReview: “The Sadness of the Executioner”, Fritz Leiber, 1973.\n\nI admit I didn’t mind this one so much.\n\nIt’s fairly short and about Death at the heart of Shadowland. But even Death has his masters, and he’s got a quota of people whose expiration date has arrived in the city of Nerewhon:\n\n“one hundred sixty peasants and savages, twenty nomads, ten warriors, two beggars, a whore, a merchant, a priest, an aristocrat, a craftsman, a king, and two heroes.”\n\nMostly easy, but things are running close. He’s got 12 heartbeats to dispatch the last 12 people.\n\nAnd, so, he turns attention to two heroes or, at least, Fafhrd and Mouser. Sure, they had “served him well and in vastly more varied fashion than the Mad Duke” whom he just killed. But even pawns that get promoted have to be taken off the board eventually.\n\nAnd so Death moves another piece to make the strike: Esafem, one time harem-girl, now mutilated and depiliated and on a second career as a blacksmith, scantily clad in metal breast cups from which poisoned – if alluring – needles jut.\n\n(Spoilers ahead)\n\nOf course, our two heroes manage to beat their fate.\n\nDeath is sort of a stand-in for an author. He likes to use the material at hand to make his deaths believeable, but, if pressed for time (as happens when Fafhrd and the Mouser evade their deaths) he’ll resort to deus ex machina as he does by killing two paragons of chivalry – which Fafhrd and the Mouser definitely aren’t. It’s interesting that even Death has his masters and will eventually die.\n\nReview: Null-ABC, H. Beam Piper and John J. McGuire, 1953.\n\nIt’s a world where department stores launch armed attacks on their competitors. Elections have gangs who beat up and occasionally kill the opposition. (And, if you don’t have your own gang, you can rent one.) Technology has stagnated. High school students assault their teachers regularly. And most of the population is illiterate.\n\nYes, there’s a Crisis in 2140. That was the better titled selected for the novel when it was republished as part of an Ace Double in 1957. It was originally serialized in the February and March 1953 issues of Astounding Science Fiction, and I suspect editor John W. Campbell gave it a title reminiscent of A. E. van Vogt’s Null-A series which ran in Astounding in the 1940s.\n\nThe work is part of a group of 1950s science fiction novels dealing with the theme of anti-intellectualism. They include Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and Fritz Leiber’s The Silver Eggheads (which I have not read). Like another such novel, James Gunn’s The Burning, it features a population that blames historical problems on intellectuals, and, in particular, has reacted against that basic intellectual tool: literacy.\n\nThere has always been, on the part of the Illiterate public, some resentment against organized Literacy. In part, it has been due to the high fees charged for Literate services, and to what seems, to many, to be monopolistic practices. But behind that is a general attitude of anti-intellectualism which is our heritage from the disastrous wars of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries. Chester Pelton has made himself the spokesman of this attitude. In his view, it was men who could read and write who hatched the diabolical political ideologies and designed the frightful nuclear weapons of that period. In his mind, Literacy is equated with ‘Mein Kampf’ and ‘Das Kapital’, with the A-bomb and the H-bomb, with concentration camps and blasted cities.\n\nYes, in this society literacy is so rare – but still a necessary skill – that Literates have their own union, the Associated Fraternities of Literates. And men like Chester Pelton, owner of a department store, resent that their skills are needed. And he can do something about it. He’s a senator in the North American Confederacy.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAfter reading Tales of Yog-Sothoth and The Book of Yig, I decided it was time to fill in the few gaps in my David Hambling reading.\n\nGiven the title of the anthology, I was intrigued to read a non-Mythos piece of science fiction from him.\n\nReview: Time Loopers: Four Tales from a Time War, 2020.\n\nThis is a curious anthology in several respects.\n\nFirst, as you will note above, it has no listed editor.\n\nSecond, it isn’t what its listing on Amazon mostly suggests. (I couldn’t even find it on the Crystal Lake Publishing site, but it’s still for sale.)\n\nThird, it’s actually a Cthulhu Mythos anthology.\n\nDavid Hambling’s “Introduction” looks at the universal appeal of a do over in our life, approaching life like a videogame where we can cycle and cycle through one level in order to level up to the next one. The reasons for doing that are many, and the book’s stories look at several. He also mentions several films and books and their use of the idea. We get our first hint of what’s to come when H. P. Lovecraft’s The Shadow Out of Time is mentioned. What if something like its Yith showed a more sinister source and motive for time looping.\n\nThis book is structured something like a musical suite – if each movement was composed by a separate party. I’m going to go spare on the plot synopsis because these stories are also linked – linked in fact by the literary DNA of Lovecraft but also of one of the contributors, Byron Craft. That became obvious after I read some of his other works after finishing this book. I also don’t want to spoil many of enjoyable moments of revelation.\n\nAnd, of course, time travel stories tend to have intricate plots with paradoxes. Not every mystery posed by these stories is solved. Not every ending has a resolved chord. But that’s alright. Mystery has its place in fantastic fiction and is a pleasing feature however much it comes across as mere incompetence in less skilled writers. And a puzzled reader, here, matches the frequently puzzled protagonists.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nDon’t worry. There will be more on Arthur Machen. I have read and will be reviewing more of his work.\n\nHowever, a few months ago, two to be exact, I watched a rather mediocre movie on Amazon based on this story.\n\nBeing a Fritz Leiber fan – at least of his non-sword-and-sorcery, I looked it up.\n\nReview. “The Hill and the Hole”, Fritz Leiber, 1941.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this 1942 story was first published in Unknown since it partakes of that magazine’s mixture of science and rationality with horror and fantasy.\n\nOur protagonist, Tom Digby, is somewhere in the Midwest surveying for the US Geological Service.\n\nHe encounters an anomaly. He can’t get an accurate reading on a hill’s height using a transit and altimeter.\n\nA girl who lives on the land the “hill” is on, warns him that it is, in fact, a hole as his instruments say. Furthermore, “They” live there, and They don’t like to be disturbed. She even tells him another man went up the hill a couple of years ago and “They made him dead.”\n\nDigby meets his boss, Ben Shelley, for lunch, and Ben shows him the last topographic map for the area. It does, indeed, show a hole instead of a hill.\n\nDigby asks Shelley to help him take another reading. Ben mentions some oddities about the death of the last man who tried to survey it. He was suffocated.\n\nContinue reading →"
