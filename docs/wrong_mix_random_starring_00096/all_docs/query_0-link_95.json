        "text": "Abigail completed her Part 1 at the Glasgow School of Art, where, in the wake of the first Mackintosh fire and on the eve of the second one, she became interested in conservation and restoration, asking when, what and indeed whether to restore buildings at all?\n\nAbigail has worked in Seville as an assistant for Yadland Arquitectos on live and prospective residential projects. She also co-founded ‘Peek Home’, an online home designing service. For the past year, Abigail has worked in London for Jo Cowen architects, working on a range of schemes from large-scale masterplanning to individual private residences. Abigail is very much looking forward to developing her own practice at the LSA alongside continuing to learn the tools of the profession at JCA.\n\nAdam Smith is pre-development director at Stanhope and is the company’s sustainability champion. He oversaw the delivery of the first phase of Ruskin Square, Stanhope’s development in Croydon with Schroders and more recently has been assisting the Crown Estate with the design and planning of a significant landmark scheme in central London.\n\nPrior to joining Stanhope Adam practised as an architect at Arup Associates where he was involved on a range of commercial, sports and media related projects. He studied at Cambridge, the Royal College of Art and the Architectural Association; and was a visiting technical tutor at the Bartlett School of Architecture whilst in practice.\n\nAs a RIBA chartered architect he takes a keen interest in architectural education and development. Representing Stanhope as an LSA founding partner, Adam and his colleagues have provided talks, support to crits and tutorials with colleagues to LSA students over the past few years.\n\nShe was born in India and lived there for 10 years before moving to the UK. Aishwarya completed her undergraduate studies at Kingston University London. She has worked on residential design, Interior design, community renewable projects and refurbishments.\n\nAishwarya worked at a renovations company as an intern before going to work for an architecture firm for well over a year. During her time at LSA, an important objective of hers is to focus leaning towards sustainability and transforming outdated spaces. Outside of architecture, Aishwarya works on the jewellery company that she established. A lot of the inspiration that she takes for architecture and other creative aspects comes directly from nature and her travels. She will be undergoing her placement at Groupwork + Amin Taha Architects for the Inter-Practice year. In her spare time, she enjoys painting, cooking and yoga.\n\nFollowing a degree in History of Art from Cambridge, Alan received his doctorate on Architectural Education in Britain 1880-1914. He is a prolific writer for magazines and author of numerous books. He is joint editor of the journal Twentieth Century Architecture and joint editor of the monograph series, Twentieth Century Architects. He has curated popular exhibitions, including Modern Britain 1929-39 (Design Museum), 1999; Eric Ravilious (Imperial War Museum), 2003; and Eros to the Ritz: 100 Years of Street Architecture (Royal Academy), 2013.\n\nAs professor of architecture and cultural history at the University of Greenwich, Alan taught architectural history and theory for undergraduate and diploma courses from 1999-2012, and has been a frequent external examiner for PhD and other higher degrees. He is chairman of Pollock’s Toy Museum Trust in London, and formerly chair of the Twentieth Century Society (2007-12). An expert on 20th century architecture, Alan was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2008.\n\nAlan is the Design History Module Leader for the Second Year students at the LSA.\n\nAlec graduated from the University of Nottingham in 2016, with a First Class MEng in Architecture & Environmental Design. Informed by the work of Richard Sennett, his undergraduate project Stanley Commons won the award for Best Portfolio, and began his interest in tackling complex urban issues facing cities.\n\nFollowing Part 1, Alec moved to San Francisco where he spent 12 months working for SCB Architects on a range of projects from a campus masterplan and education buildings to commercial and residential projects across California. Returning to London, Alec joined Allies & Morrison, where he worked on The London College of Fashion at Stratford Waterfront, developing his technical design skills and gaining experience on a large and complex project.\n\nDuring his time at The LSA, Alec has engaged with the issue of food, combining a personal interest with his studies. His DTT project, Emerging Tools: Homesteading the City, proposed a self-sufficient, high density, residential neighbourhood that celebrates the production and consumption of food. The issue of feeding cities was also the focus of Alec’s thesis project: The Future of Food, which proposed a campus of agricultural and culinary buildings as an exemplary microcosm of sustainable urban food.\n\nBorn and raised in the fertile grounds of South Africa, Alexander pursued his Bachelor’s in Cape Town. His studies tackled difficult issues of the extreme inequality of Cape Town’s urban realm. They further revealed the complexities that emerge from an unmanaged urban growth, and how the urban fabric begins to reflect and spatialise society. With a hunger to see and understand more of the world he went to Santiago de Chile. Knowing no one there. With no place to stay. And only a handful of Spanish phrases – which no one understood. Emerging with new friends and remarkable experiences after a year, he went back home to do his one-year Honours post-grad. Three months after graduating his itchy feet (usually covered in beach sand or salty water) walked him to London and into the LSA – embracing yet another challenge. Another city. Another new perspective.\n\nAlex graduated from the University of Plymouth in 2016, where his design project was nominated for the RIBA Bronze Medal. Following that, he worked at Ben Adams Architects in London for four years where he was able to participate in multiple projects at various scales, taking leading roles in a series of bids and competitions, and provided visual representations of many schemes.\n\nDuring his two years at the LSA, Alex’s research and design work focussed on human engagement with space and form, and relationships between London’s existing urban fabric and potential propositional spaces. His design synthesis project looked at proposing a viable alternative future for the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. He is now looking forward to expanding upon the knowledge he has gained and applying it to new projects and opportunities in London. Outside of Architecture, Alex spends most of his free time cooking and building the interior of a narrowboat he bought during his studies.\n\nEver since graduating from Central Saint Martins, I have had the chance to embrace multiple disciplines. Having working as an architectural assistant, interior and furniture designer, made me more open-minded towards the paths I can take as an architect. During my studies I worked for different architecture offices in London (Foster+Partners), Paris (Love Editions) and at last Salzburg (Odile Schroeder).\n\nProjects range from a mixed-use residential and retail development “The One” in Toronto, to working alongside Jérôme Faillant-Dumas on designing homes and apartments for private clients and making bespoke furniture for today’s interiors. In my work, I am particularly interested in how I can communicate architecture visually, in terms of images that show spatial and atmospheric qualities. When I am not involved with architecture, I like to rediscover cities from a musical point of view by looking for old music records.\n\nAlexandra is from Rromania and travelled to the UK 5 years ago, to do an undergrad at University of Kent with an Erasmus exchange in France, Lile. For her Part 1 she came to the big city, London, where she worked for a small company called Simon Whitehead, located in Borough, where she specialised in residential projects. Starting at the LSA, Alexandra joined Piercy&Co where she worked on numerous large projects, including fit-outs for fashion design brands, residential and offices. Currently she is still trying to find out what she wants her blueprint in architecture to be by pulling in interests from other aspects of her life. Going into architecture she wanted to design for people something that will improve their quality of life, even though she didn’t quite know what that entailed. She is still working on defining what that looks like, but the future looks bright and exciting.\n\nAlexandra was born and raised on the Black Sea Coast of Romania and her background has informed her interest in ‘heterotopias’ and how real spaces juxtapose with several other spaces.\n\nAfter graduating from VIA University College Denmark Alexandra spent two months in China researching further the spatial conditions of public spaces of power such as Tiananmen Square from Beijing. She has also completed an exchange year at the Politecnico di Milano, after which she spent four years working research projects across Europe. She has worked for the Copenhagen Architecture Festival where she co-curated of a 1:1 exhibition of Lacaton & Vassal’s modernist estate extension in Bordeaux. Furthermore ,Alexandra has worked at Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects in Copenhagen and collaborated with COBE Architects.\n\nDuring her first year at the LSA, Alexandra will be working at Piercy & Co. When not working, Alexandra loves indulging in music, books, 60’s Italian cinema or experimenting with new flavours.\n\nAlexis completed his Part 1 studies at the Mackintosh School of Architecture. His final project investigates the sensitivity of Balloch’s true beauty of repeated journeys and its regular movements to and around Loch Lomond. He highlights sustainable and social attitudes towards designing a residential retreat and performance centre that sits poetically along the banks of the loch, creating pockets of nostalgia through zoning and journeys within its built environment.\n\nAlexis has gained two years of professional experience from RIBA stages 0-5 in a small residential practice in London. He has gained considerable knowledge on projects within a conservation area and new builds, as well as proficiency in coordinating and preparing planning, tender and construction packages. He has collaborated with his team on design competitions and feasibility studies on the regeneration of urban infill sites, as well as tackling issues of homelessness.\n\nAt the London School of Architecture, he hopes to further explore the relationships between ‘meanwhile’ urban spaces and broaden his knowledge of social and commercial developments. He aims to develop innovative design through sustainable constructions methods and solutions of co-operative living within the built environment.\n\nThroughout the Inter-practice year he will complete his placement at NBBJ, an ideas-driven design firm focusing on numerous hospitals and healthcare facilities nationally. Outside of architecture, Alexis enjoys gallery and exhibition visits, sketching and physical health.\n\nAfter studying at the Bartlett School of Architecture UCL, Alice worked at Jan Kattein Architects for two years, and will continue to do so through her practice placement. Through JKA she developed her interests in making and self-build projects. She has just completed a self-build project where she worked as a full time Site Manager. Alice has been involved in a number of independent self built projects such as festival installations and pavilions and a competition with Raumlabor in Munich.\n\nA lot of her work is based around communities and during her university studies she became interested in social housing, and especially London’s housing crisis. At UCL she set up a platform with her friend to discuss issues associated with London’s housing crisis so that architecture students could become more aware of the social impact of architecture.\n\nBorn and raised in south London with a small amount of Armenian heritage, Alice graduated from the University of Edinburgh with First Class Honours in June 2015. Her final project was nominated for the RIBA President’s Medals.\n\nAlice is keenly interested in diversity within the industry and in October 2014, she coordinated the re-launch of Chicks with Bricks, an event for women in the construction industry, which she ran under the stewardship of Holly Porter for two years. Within this role Alice arranged high-profile women such as Annie Hampson, Alison Nimmo and Nicky Morgan to speak at the events, which aim to inspire young women within the industry.\n\nAlice is currently working for Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners where she enjoys views of one of her all time favourite buildings, Lloyds of London. She enjoys reading, plumbing, travelling, sketching and single malt whisky.\n\nBeth graduated from the University of Westminster in 2019 with first class honours, where she developed a keen interest in the connection between design and memory. Her work explores the theme of retaining fragments of historic details in contemporary Architecture – linking the relationship between the community and individual journeys on the site; past, present & future.\n\nSince then, she has worked for two years at Marek Wojciechowski Architects; assisting a range of residential and commercial projects through various RIBA Work stages, including the Grade I listed Diorama building on Regents Park.\n\nWhile studying at the LSA, Beth hopes to create architecture that re-establishes a sense of community and positively impacts individual lives. Her intention is to design in a way that responds sensitively, harmoniously but also drastically to the site and environment in which it will exist. For her LSA practice placement, Beth will be working at AHMM, where she hopes to gain further experience to support her studies.\n\nBetty grew up in the London Borough of Croydon, surrounded by modernist towers that sparked an early interest in the built environment. She completed her Part I at the University of Nottingham where she developed an interest in modes of living, hybrid typologies and self-sufficient communities.\n\nBetty spent her first year out working at Hawkins\\Brown working mostly in the residential sector, exploring co-living and helping to develop new space standards. As part of her LSA placement, Betty will continue at Hawkins/Brown where she is currently working on feasibility studies for residential projects and working on a landmark research building for a London university.\n\nAt the LSA, Betty wants to create socially conscious architecture that puts people first and celebrates the everyday. In her limited spare time Betty hopes to continue going to gigs, trying new recipes and finally conquer jazz piano!\n\nCalven graduated from The University of Nottingham in 2016, with a First Class MEng in Architecture and Environmental Design. He returned as a weekly-visiting graduate tutor for a year following his Part 1 graduation.\n\nCalven has since been working in London, gaining experience from both Mobile Studio Architects and HUT Architecture. He has worked on a variety of London-based residential and office projects that focus on environmental impact, public space research and occupant comfort\n\nDuring his time at the LSA, Calven has been investigating London’s green and blue spaces. His thesis project, London City Reservoir, looks into the importance of the water cycle to cater for London’s future freshwater capacity. As the city becomes a megacity (with a population over 10 million within the next 15 years) freshwater resources will become increasingly difficult to manage. The proposal aims to mediate between water infrastructure and robust architecture on the River Lea, via the construction of a new river cut and institute for water education.\n\nCameron spent much of his childhood straddling the Atlantic, with roots in both New York and London. After school, he studied art and design at a college in Glasgow before going to read Architecture at the University of Edinburgh. He worked as part of the editorial team at Dezeen in Shoreditch, as well as at Kettle Collective in Edinburgh, but has also founded a theatre company and worked as a designer at Hyped.\n\nCameron’s eclectic interests provide the stimulus for his approach to architecture, creating a platform on which to amalgamate experience in theatre, writing, graphic design, fine art, business and marketing. He disputes that a busy CV suggests distraction rather than a more thorough engagement with the world. This has led to a fascination with how architecture can interact constructively outside of its field, and how other fields can inform architecture to create more comprehensive solutions to the daunting problems at hand.\n\nCarrick graduated from the University of Westminster with a First in 2016. He is interested in reducing waste by driving out inefficiencies in design and construction by encouraging off-site manufacturing. His thesis project, RE:SOURCE, focuses on creating an off-site manufacturing facility and workshop to supply London with structurally sound and 100% recycled materials for a circular economy.\n\nBefore and during the LSA, Carrick has worked at Grimshaw Architects in London for over 3 years. He has worked on a variety of large scale award-winning projects and has been able to further his research into sustainability in the built environment and a global, collaborative, circular-economy during his time there.\n\nOut of the studio, Carrick is a keen cyclist and likes to play sport when he can. He has rowed competitively for Marlow and represented England in a men’s quad.\n\nCharity completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Nottingham, where she developed an interest in designing disruptive, emotive architecture. Alongside her studies, Charity contributed to improving the student experience as a Course Representative.\n\nShe then spent a year working for Ryder Architecture, where she was involved in international projects across a variety of sectors and took part in hosting the studio’s Hyperloop installation in the Great Exhibition of the North.\n\nWhile at the LSA, Charity worked at Jestico+Whiles, gaining experience in the education sector internationally, exploring the architect’s role in society as a RIBA Ambassador and analysing collaborative architectural design in conjunction with her studies. This supported Charity’s interest in architecture’s capacity to impact society. It was the driver for her thesis project, which proposed a new civic typology which used food as the catalyst for exchange and celebration of everyday culture in the community.\n\nCharles was born and raised in Cambridge where he completed a year of art school specialising in large scale sculpture installation. He began studying architecture at the University of Westminster under the tutelage of Assemble.\n\nAfter graduating, he interned with Boyarsky Murphy Architects where he worked on international competitions. He also worked in conservation with Marcus Beale Architects and applied his skillset to construction site works in Sydney and London.\n\nWhile at the LSA, Charles worked at AHMM on projects at various scales. He developed an interest in development economics which shaped his fifth-year thesis project: Local Capital. The project explored the relationship between architecture, space and capital by proposing a New Bank Headquarters in the Isle of Dogs. The vision of the project was to address wealth inequality and to regain community and public trust in financial support of local start-ups and social enterprise.\n\nCharles will begin an MA in Philosophy while working freelance before he returns to complete his Part 3.\n\nCharlie completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Bath. She has since undertaken placements at London practices: LEEP Architects and LTS Architects. She worked a stint as a set designer on a Bollywood film and travelled to Cuba on a research project to explore how the country’s 20th-century revolution impacted its architecture.\n\nFollowing graduation Charlie returned to LTS, working predominantly on competition bids and a social housing project, the latter being an area she explored in her undergraduate final year thesis. Until April, Charlie worked at Lipton Plant Architects, assisting on a wide range of projects and competitions.\n\nDuring her time at the LSA, Charlie has been focusing on the rapidly developing area of Stratford, from a pedestrianisation proposal in her Urban Studies module to a Planning Centre proposal for her thesis project. The latter stemmed from her thesis ‘Open Plan’ which called for a transparent and inclusive planning system- with a planning hub in every borough.\n\nIn her spare time, Charlie enjoys playing guitar and exploring London on bike and on foot.\n\nCharlotte is an architect and director of the architectural practice Skene Catling de la Peña. She uses research as a basis for design, with a particular interest in the borders between architecture and other disciplines. Her practice has won numerous awards including the RIBA House of the Year 2015, and has been extensively published internationally. She was named a Debrett’s 500 People of Influence in Architecture & Design in 2016 and was shortlisted for the 2016 Architectural Review Women in Architecture award.\n\nCharlotte has written about architecture in The Burlington, The Sunday Telegraph, The Architectural Review and ARCH+. She collaborated with Malcolm McLaren on film scripts and has made architectural films that have been shown in festivals around the world. She ran a postgraduate architecture unit at the Royal College of Art for five years and teaches a masters unit at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany. Charlotte is an External Examiner for the Greenwich School of Architecture, and is currently completing a research project with the Royal College of Art and the Rothschild Foundation on representation in architecture.\n\nCharly has recently completed her Part 1 at the University of Nottingham. As part of the ‘Forgotten Places’ unit, she became interested in the revival and transformation of previously neglected spaces. Her thesis investigated the decline of the traditional, retail focussed, highstreet and strove to create a new alternative. Identifying COVID as a catalyst in this decline and studying its wider effects on\n\nsociety – her thesis set out a new environment to fill these previously neglected spaces and bring together a wide spectrum of uses and users, in particular, catering for an increasing demand for adult education and retraining.\n\nSince graduating in 2021, Charly has worked at AHMM where she has been able to continue to work with retrofit projects, working on a mixed-use office scheme. She will continue to work there alongside her studies at LSA.\n\nConnie completed her Part 1 studies at the Sheffield School of Architecture in 2020. She worked with both Design Engine Architects and DEDRAFT over the subsequent two years which has given her a wide range of experience from large scale education campuses to private residential projects.\n\nConnie is driven by creating socially responsible and inclusive environments that are rooted in both their physical and social contexts. She believes that community centred design, with imaginative and tactile spaces, produces engaging architecture that has a positive impact on the wellbeing of those who use it. She thinks sustainability is critically important, and that it should be approached holistically throughout the design process and a building’s life. She explored this in her undergraduate design projects and dissertation ‘Circular Design: The Future of Sustainable Architecture?’.\n\nThrough her studies with the LSA and work with Mikhail Riches, Connie is looking forward to further researching these themes and learning about socially and environmentally sustainable architecture that makes a positive difference.\n\nIn her spare time, Connie enjoys going to the theatre and art exhibitions as well as keeping active through ballet, walking and swimming.\n\nDan graduated from the University of Plymouth in 2016 with First Class Honours. Since then, he has gained experience in both large and small practices. While at the LSA, he worked for TDO Architecture, where he was involved with a multitude of projects at varying scales, from a Clerkenwell Design Week installation to a large scale housing scheme in Bristol.\n\nHe was part of the Emerging Tools Design Think Tank which proposed an alternative model for sustainable urban development, focusing on responsible food production. The project was published by BBC Good Food, FutureArc and Citizen magazine.\n\nHis thesis project focused on the redevelopment of existing structures and how social engagement through design can form a safer community. He situated the project in The Stratford Centre in the year 2050, when the shopping complex became redundant.\n\nOutside of architecture, Dan enjoys making furniture as well as designing and fitting out his narrowboat, where he lives with his partner and his forever growing plant collection.\n\nDaniel Davis is a programmes manager with a wealth of experience primarily in start-ups and scale-ups across a broad range of sectors including architecture, academia, local government, real estate, hospitality, culture and technology.\n\nIn 2022 he completed studies at the Bartlett School of Architecture, receiving an MA in Architecture and Historic Urban Environments. The programme – addressing the built environment’s contribution to planetary crisis – catalysed a commitment to understanding and responding to the social, economic and environmental inequity ingrained in our built fabric, and prompted a deep interest in education’s transformative potential as an agent of positive change.\n\nHe joined the London School of Architecture in September 2023 to lead its professional learning programmes, which aim to build a culture of lifelong learning in design and construction that ultimately places the built environment sector at the vanguard of our essential transition to a green economy.\n\nLaunching in November 2023 following a successful pilot earlier in the year, his contribution spans the strategic, creative and editorial components of the programme, and aligns with his particular passion for scaling purpose-led projects, programmes and organisations.\n\nWith over twenty-five years of experience in the international design industry, Daniel Gava is a highly respected board advisor. In his distinguished career, he has held pivotal roles in marketing, PR, sales, and in the board of directors of top international high-end furniture manufacturers in Europe and the United States.\n\nBased in London since 2011, Daniel operates as an independent board advisor and works with design companies, assisting them in staying ahead of the curve and maintaining their brand’s relevance. He leverages his extensive knowledge of the design industry’s dynamics and key players to provide valuable insights and guidance. A passionate innovator and connector, Daniel has been a major influence in the London design scene for many years, advocating for creativity, design culture, inclusion and promoting a smart approach to business and relationship building.\n\nCurrent and past collaborations include among others Arper, Minotti, Moroso, Virgin Galactic, Poltrona Frau, architect and designer Michele De Lucchi, Magis and the Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the UK. Daniel is a Design Patron of the Design Museum, Ambassador of the London School of Architecture and has been nominated as Testimonial for the International Italian Design Day 2022 by the Italian Consulate in the UK.\n\nDaniel was drawn to the LSA because of its unique relationship to the city and how it connects practice and study with different spaces in London. Daniel’s research as part of the school’s Soho project revealed an opportunity to use redundant spaces in the city, as a result he has been involved in finding and securing a studio space for the school in the centre of Soho on a rent-free basis.\n\nHe has previously studied at Greenwich University where he gained a first class degree and won the architecture cardboard medal award 2008, PLB award in 2011, and outstanding achievement in environmental design 2011 for his final year project.\n\nDan has worked in various practices and in different fields. Interested in collaboration and participation within architecture, he has run workshops in collective design and building across Europe. His interest in engaging different people in these processes has led him in 2014 to set up The Field: a community project space in New Cross, south London in 2014.\n\nDaniel has been teaching as a first year design tutor at London Southbank University 2014-2015. He is currently on his placement at aLL Design Worldwide.\n\nDaniel is an architect and co-founder of Artefact which designs homes, community and cultural projects that reflect the culture of their users. Working collaboratively with clients and communities, his work marries the craft of architecture with a commitment to delivering projects that seek to bring joy to their users while minimising carbon in construction and in use.\n\nDaniel studied architecture at University of Cambridge and the Bartlett School of Architecture. Prior to founding Artefact, Daniel worked as an Associate at Henley Halebrown, leading educational projects, residential developments, masterplans and research studies for Local Authorities across London. He has previously worked at urban design practice Publica, Alison Brooks Architects and MVRDV in Rotterdam. Daniel has taught design studios at the University of Nottingham and Central St Martins. His writing and work have been widely published and exhibited, and he is a mentor on the FLUID Built By Us Programme.\n\nDaniel is a First Year Design Tutor at the LSA.\n\nDaniel graduated with a First from the University of Nottingham, before spending 2 years at SimpsonHaugh in Manchester and London where he developed his knowledge of project feasibility, early stage work and elegant design. During the LSA he worked 3 days a week at Spanish multidisciplinary firm IDOM.\n\nDaniel is passionate about the intersection between beautiful design and building sustainably amidst the environmental crisis. At the LSA, Daniel designed an urban solar park for the roof of the ExCel Centre, which he pitched to the CEO. He was also part of a team which won the ‘Game Changer’ LFA award for an alternative design of Custom House station in the Royal Docks.\n\nHis thesis project imagined the white collar workplace of the future: an urban forest imperceptibly blurred with conditioned workspace. A place where serendipitous encounters, recreation and ecological vitality are as equally prioritised as productivity.\n\nWhen he’s not working, he can be found socialising, cooking or producing music.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Nottingham in 2016, Dante worked for two years at Studio Anyo, where he took on a leading role in a £100m modular mixed-use development in Queensway, London.\n\nDuring his first year at the LSA, Dante worked for DeMatos Ryan on the V&A Museum of Childhood. He was also part of a design think tank proposing an alternative model for sustainable urban development based on the responsible production and consumption of fresh food. In 2019, this research was published by Citizen magazine, FutureArc, and the BBC.\n\nHis Second Year thesis project proposed a new urban typology for London, combining housing and industry. Building on research by Dr. Frances Holliss, he proposed three typologies of industry based on their relationship to the home and developed a new spatial design strategy.\n\nDante is currently working at Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM) on a mixed-use project in Kings Cross exploring alternative methods of sustainable construction.\n\nOutside the world of architecture, Dante enjoys middle-distance running, competing regionally in the 800m and 5,000m.\n\nDev graduated from the Leicester School of Architecture where his final year project aimed to reignite the lost creative arts in Berlin’s Tempelhof district using sculpture as a means to bring the local community together and form a nexus of design.\n\nHe has since worked at a small practice in Leicester where he was able to help design projects within the local community and later, a construction company which provided him with an alternate perspective on the design process.\n\nWhilst studying at the LSA, Dev hopes to explore themes such as sustainable growth and the production of morally responsible architecture so that people can experience more fulfilled lives. For his practice placement, Dev will be working at John McAslan + Partners.\n\nYou can usually find Dev in a museum or gallery in his spare time.\n\nKat is a researcher, writer, lecturer and urbanist with academic qualifications in architecture, urban design, geography and planning policy for which she has been awarded nine international scholarships and awards. Her PhD focussed on the role of public protest as a form of community engagement in the development process and her ongoing research is split between public engagement, housing and public space, and the practice of research in architecture.\n\nBefore launching Architecture + Urbanism Research Office in 2018, she was Research Director for a large architecture practice based in Sydney and then Head of Research and Innovation at the RIBA, leading the restructure and relaunch of the President’s Awards for Research.

While at the LSA he has gained experience in several different areas, however, has used the opportunity to dig deeper into the social issues affecting our cities.\n\nHis thesis project, ‘Finding the Hidden Homeless,’ proposed a mixed-use development with a shelter at its heart which aims to alleviate social and economic strain by establishing new connections within communities. He believes that by mixing different user groups together it is possible to create positive social interactions which in turn will act as drivers for change.\n\nIvo completed his Part I studies at Newcastle University where he first developed an interest in the social impact of design and defensive architecture, looking at the ways cities are designed to control and curb specific behavioural trends.\n\nFollowing this, Ivo worked at a couple of small practices before moving to Grimshaw where he has been for more than three years. Working beneath Andrew Thomas, and then Kirsten Lees, he’s gained valuable experience on a wide range of projects and sectors, including residential, transport infrastructure, sports and arts.\n\nIvo is now excited by the prospect of aligning future working opportunities with his particular research interests, striving towards a socially sustainable future.\n\nBefore joining the LSA, Jacob has spent the last two years working at aLL Design under the leadership of Will Alsop. Prior to this he completed his BArch at the University of Nottingham’s Ningbo Campus.\n\nHis time in China has given Jacob insight into its culture and history, while also sparking his interest in its architectural and urban future. As a result, much of his work focuses on improving neglected areas in large Chinese cities by utilising key buildings and sites as ‘catalysts’ for regeneration. Jacob’s work has been displayed in a number of galleries and magazines throughout China.\n\nOver the past couple of years Jacob has worked on the successful planning application for Alaska, a residential building in Toronto, as well as a large mixed use scheme in Brentford. Most recently he designed a much publicised house extension as part of Channel 4’s TV programme Ugly House to Lovely House presented by George Clarke.\n\nJahba is interested in community engagement as a means of furthering participation within Architecture. Her interest in community engagement is rooted in decolonial theories of knowledge, looking at the notion of embodied knowledge that comes from the lived experience of communities and people.\n\nAfter completing her Part 1, at the Bartlett School of Architecture, she worked as an Engagement Officer at the RIBA, under the learning programme. Through this role, she has worked with a range of different audiences, including school children, families and adult learners, introducing them to concepts around the built environment and seeking to improve access to architectural knowledge.\n\nShe has also researched, developed and presented content centred around South Asian history and its intersection with the built environment, both for the RIBA and South Asian Heritage Month, in collaboration with Manchester Museum.\n\nAs a Part 1, she worked at Native Studio, contributing to competitions and bids based in areas of East London, where she grew up. Through her work she is keen to emphasise the value that comes from the lived experience of often over looked communities.\n\nJames completed his Part I at the University of Bath, spending a semester as an Erasmus student at the Technische Universität München, and graduated in 2020. He is interested in creating an architecture that is resolutely honest, clear in its tectonics, and makes best use of the right resources in the right places. His favourite buildings are those that are imbued with an appreciation of the context that they occupy, underpinned by a rational and reasoned approach to design. Most recently he has been investigating the potentials of interdisciplinary environments housed within flexible, demountable construction; working with economies of means that maximise circularity and efficiency in both construction and use, minimising waste across a project’s physical and temporal cycles.\n\nBetween his undergraduate studies James worked on housing and conservation projects at a number of small practices in London. This concurrence of study and practice is a programme of development that he is looking forward to sustaining during his time at the LSA; since graduating he has been working with Haworth Tompkins, alongside volunteering for a local Wildlife Trust, and will continue to do so in parallel with his studies.\n\nJessica’s work during her time at the LSA has focused on the idea of valuing what we already have. This idea underpinned her thesis, ‘Value V Value’, which looked at how the architecture community and the wider world needs to see embodied carbon on par with the historical value of buildings when considering demolition. In addition to looking at how we can better implement a reduce, reuse and recycle mentality within the architecture profession. Her final project then put these theories into practice in ‘Home Again’, which looked to refurbish an existing estate and its public realm whilst retaining as much of the existing structures, trees and materials found on-site as possible.\n\nJessica completed her Part 1 at The Bartlett UCL and worked for three years at Daab Design in London for her years out where she was involved in a variety of projects at different scales.\n\nOriginally from South Derbyshire, Josh studied his undergraduate at Coventry University, where a community first approach to architecture became a large interest for him. Since graduating, Josh moved to London and has worked on many projects both within the UK and Europe. This has given him a chance to work on a variety of projects and scales; from landmarks to sheds to furniture. Josh is working at Resident Architects whilst at the LSA where he hopes to develop his abilities and knowledge whilst working on projects to help to elevate communities.\n\nJosh wishes to continue on his interest in working with communities and in particular, wants to investigate how to empower and embolden networks to better support the most vulnerable in society. He hopes to explore a variety of topics to create an approach to architecture that is innovative, compassionate and flexible.\n\nKatja graduated from the Bartlett in 2015 with a First Class BSc in Architecture. She then joined Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners where she worked on the Centre Building at the LSE.

From 2010-2016, she was the course leader and senior lecturer on London Met’s MA Cities programme, which sought to provide training for the next generation of city regenerators and leaders, with a particular focus on London.\n\nCurrent work focuses on advising and implementing new models for urban practice and governance that are more informed, collaborative and life changing, which are undertaken through her own practice and government advisory roles. The role of new technology and city leadership to aid better city design processes are of particular interest in this field of work. She is a member of the Northern Ireland Ministerial Advisory Group for Architecture and the Built Environment, co-ordinates a network on urban governance in UN Habitat’s Universities Network Initiative, and is currently completing a PhD entitled ‘Enabling Design-Led Decision Making: Towards a New Urban Governance Framework and its Practice in London’.\n\nLesley Lokko is an architect, academic, and best-selling novelist. She was previously the founder and director of the Graduate School of Architecture at the University of Johannesburg and will be stepping down as dean of The Bernard & Anne Spitzer School of Architecture, City College of New York in January 2021. She is currently engaged in setting up an independent school of architecture in Accra, Ghana, the African Futures Institute. Born in Scotland, Lesley grew up in Ghana. She received her first architecture degree at London’s Bartlett School of Architecture and earned her doctorate in architecture from the University of London in 2007.\n\nWhilst still a student, Lesley began an edited anthology that has come to define her interests across both her academic career and her fiction writing: ‘race’ and its relationship to the built environment, although that initial interest has expanded considerably to encompass a broader interest in identity politics, culture and urbanism. White Papers, Black Marks: Race, Space & Architecture was published in 2000, some six years after its inception. It remains one of the few anthologies dedicated specifically to the study of ‘race’ as a meaningful category of enquiry within architectural canon.\n\nFor thirteen years, Lesley wrote fiction full-time, publishing eleven best-selling novels but continued to keep a peripheral interest and foot in architectural discourse, returning to academia full-time in 2014. She continues to write fiction: her newest novel, Soul Sisters, will be published by PanMacmillan in summer 2021.\n\nLinda is originally from Lebanon but raised in Milan, Italy and The Hague, Netherlands prior to moving to the UK, where she studied at the University of Kent. She worked at John McAslan and Partners and Cullinan Studio for a few years and as part of her LSA Placement year.\n\nAt the LSA Linda explored topics ranging from urban strategies focusing on increasing connections and activities around the Olympic Park, to her interest in improving London’s Nighttime Culture. Linda’s Design Think Tank focused on the analysis of the lives of boaters along the River Lea and how we can learn from those who live with less, share with many and live closer to nature.\n\nHer thesis ‘Whole Habitat’ developed from community engagement workshops with a Community Land Trust in Waltham Forest into designing one building that acts as a place of home for many. The aim of the thesis — to achieve a collective sense of belonging — came from her belief that housing in London should address the whole, rather than focus on the singular unit; to be able to all feel at home and embrace the great diversities present in our living environment.\n\nLinda is a food enthusiast and enjoys learning about different cultures and languages. She also has a great passion for music, specifically jazz, and stage design.\n\nSince graduating from the Bartlett, UCL, Lisa has been working at Buckley Gray Yeoman and is excited to be bringing them into the LSA family for her first year studying here. Outside of her studies, she designed and built a pop-up cinema in Leyton as part of a larger scheme to regenerate the high street so is particularly interested in the potential of architecture to benefit a community, both for the individual and as an urban intervention. She’s recently also worked for a music production company in the build up and run time of festivals and gigs so is keen to bring this experience into her architecture. When not in the studio, you’ll find her on the water racing sailing dinghies on the south coast.\n\nLuke studied at Oxford Brookes, before moving to Berlin where he worked at Anja Beecken Architekten and helped start a small practice with Bernd Plumm, focusing mainly on residential projects.

In 2016/17, Max lead Design Think Tanks at LSA on 2015/16 and 2016/17, he is still involved with design crits. Max is currently n associate lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University.\n\nPrior to being a student at the LSA, Maxim moved to London from Hungary and completed his Part 1 at Central Saint Martins. He then gained experience working for a small residential practice in South East London. Looking to explore the fringes of architecture, he freelanced for organisations such as the Old Truman Brewery, whilst writing a paper discussing inclusive societies that he presented at the 2017 conference ‘Architecture Connects’. Max has a keen interest in architecture as an agent for societal change especially in an urban setting, which is why he is really excited to join the LSA.\n\nHe has previously taken part in various competitions and workshops working with communities and 1:1 construction. In his spare time Max enjoys reading, cooking, and claiming that his is an avid runner despite the effort it takes him to get off the couch. He is currently working for Hawkins\\Brown, helping deliver the new Crossrail Station at Tottenham Court Road.\n\nMaxine graduated from the Bartlett School of Architecture in September 2010 where she studied both her Part 1 and Part 2. There she specialised in the relationship between fashion and architecture, using performance and 1:1 installations as a way to explore this field.\n\nMaxine has worked with Will Alsop for the last seven years between her studies. In her year out at SMC Alsop she worked on the award winning Michael Faraday Primary school from concept stage to detailed design.\n\nWithin the studio Maxine specialises in producing high quality 3D and 2D presentation drawings. She has worked on a range of projects from the Lille Masterplan to smaller scale pods such as the Rough Luxe hotel.\n\nMaxine is an enthusiastic and creative individual with an eye for colour. She is driven by a desire to design with an element of the unusual, to bring a sense of surprise and delight to all that experience her work without compromising efficiency and function.\n\nThe contrast between Michael’s personal taste in design and the whimsical aesthetics of the rural Oxfordshire countryside where he grew up led him to search for a distinct personal style in diverse locations. Before embarking on his undergraduate architecture degree, he travelled extensively in Europe, North Africa and India.\n\nAfter graduating with a First Class degree from the University of Edinburgh – with his final year group project ‘Salomons River’ being nominated for the RIBA President’s Medal – he decided to settle in Pondicherry, an ex-French colony on the southeast coast of India, to work with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) and pursue personal design projects. Whilst there, he was able to explore his interest in anthropology and its intersection with design, publishing several examinations of the local post-colonial style and the relationship between the indigenous population and the French-imposed architectural surroundings.\n\nAfter returning to Europe, Michael spent two years in Berlin working with Heim Balp Architekten, an experience that allowed him to undertake global interior design and architectural projects. Following his move to London, he joined AHMM and the LSA, environments where he hopes to further explore colour, materiality, and the social and cultural relationship with space across scales.\n\nMikolaj graduated from Warsaw University of Technology with BSc in Architecture and Urban Design. While at university, he developed an interest in the preservation of historic buildings and development of cities and was one of three finalists in a competition for an art installation in front of the Public Theater of Zbigniew Hubner in Warsaw.

Her work has been nominated for the RIBA Dissertation Presidents Medal, the AJ Student Award, and has been featured online and in print by Archisource.\n\nShe focuses on the conscious connections between people and their architecture and argues that this should be strengthened through further understanding of material behaviour and spatial construction. Her work acts as a speculative proposition for how we might affordably and sustainably provide homes and neighbourhoods for belonging, identity, safety, and growth.\n\nNancy completed her Part 1 at Central Saint Martins and has most recently worked at We Made That and Delve Architects. She hopes to develop her drawing skills to further speculate the conscious connection between humankind and the built environment.\n\nNefeli completed her BArch at the University of Nottingham during which she developed a passion for humanitarian and political architecture. She is interested in the potential of architecture to fight social issues and explored this during her final year thesis project in which she designed a sanctuary for women escaping domestic abuse.\n\nAfter graduating, Nefeli worked at Nottingham-based practice, Lathams, where she worked on projects ranging from Conservation, Masterplanning and Urban Design. While at LSA, she joined Penoyre & Prasad for her practice placement, where she worked on Higher Education, Elderly Living and Healthcare projects.\n\nStudying at the LSA gave Nefeli the opportunity to further research and synthesise her manifesto on humanising architecture and city-making, by searching for integrity in regeneration. This theme was explored in her thesis project, where she designed inclusive civic infrastructure bridging over two segregated neighbouring areas and demonstrating how the communities can benefit from cross-fertilising.\n\nNicholas began as an interior designer in Cape Town, South Africa, and received a Diploma in Interior Design from BHC School of Design. After working in the industry for two years he decided architecture was where his path lay. He attended a small course in Biomimicry before enrolling at the University of Cape Town. While studying he worked as an intern at Darryl Croome Architects. In February 2016 he was accepted for an internship position at Foster + Partners, where he worked with three separate studios and had the opportunity to work on projects, in Jeddah, London and Dubai. In March 2017 he began working at Pascall + Watson with the Airport Planning Team. This was a challenging experience considering the vast amount of new knowledge he had to acquire in order to effectively assist in the planning of extensions to Birmingham International Airport, Glasgow International Airport and Schiphol International Airport. Nicholas’s dream is to integrate architecture within eco-systems in order to create a harmonious balance between the built environment and the natural world. He believes such a change will create cities which are vibrant, economically prosperous, healthy and happy.\n\nNick is a partner at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer where he has specialised in the planning, financing and delivery of infrastructure globally over the last three decades. He was a member of the London First group, which in February 2013 published the influential report into the feasibility of Crossrail 2 (chaired by Lord Adonis) that commenced the current promotion of the scheme.\n\nHe was also a member of the GLA’s Infrastructure Investment Advisory Group, which developed a London Infrastructure Plan to 2050 and is an advisor to the London Infrastructure Advisory Board.

Alongside studying for his BSc in architecture at TU Vienna he always tried to keep one foot in reality by working in various offices such as feld72, Coop Himmelb(l)au and OMA. Despite that he likes being involved with academia as well: he worked as tutor for descriptive geometry at the Institute for Discrete Mathematics and Geometry at the Technical University – which basically meant teaching microstation – and went to take on a more serious occupation as a study assistant at the department of building construction and design in his final year in Vienna. It is the integration of practice and academia that drove him towards the LSA.\n\nPhilip is a practicing architect at Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, with a significant portfolio of completed projects across London and the UK ranging from private villas to large mixed-use masterplans. All projects balance construction, urban, financial and environmental ambitions, in search of ever-better architectural outcomes.\n\nPhilip graduated from the Bartlett School of Architecture with an interest in the critical dialogue between practice and education, and the benefit that sharing information and design processes can bring to architectural discourse. Research carried out at AHMM and at the LSA informs and improves best practice, and the connection of LSA projects with live project sites, clients, technologies and constraints helps inform the future of the profession.\n\nPhilip taught final year studio at the LSA since the first cohort completed the Masters programme in 2017.\n\nCompleting a degree in French, Russian and Classics in 2014, Philippine pursued her passion for architecture, and graduated from the university of Edinburgh with a distinction and three undergraduate prizes in 2017.
