And what better place than beautiful and picturesque Zichron Ya’akov, one of the Israeli towns most connected to the Baron de Rothschild, one of the Zionist Yishuv’s most prominent backers, who purchased vast quantities of land, developed local industry and agriculture, and established numerous factories and wineries. Named in honor of the Baron’s father, Zichron Ya’akov is also his and his wife’s place of burial. Recently, new hotels have opened there, attracting many visitors eager to enjoy the spectacular views, galleries, culinary scene, and top-tier wine. We spent 24 hours there and prepared a recommendation guide for you to plan a stay there. Also this month: an interview with Linor Abargil, former Miss World whose own\n\nexperience of sexual assault pushed her to lead the battle for the recognition of the sexual violence suffered by Israeli women on October 7; a glimpse into a photography exhibition that pays homage to people who showed immense bravery on that fateful day of October 7; a list of all the major Israeli chefs who received global recognition this year; a look at Israeli artists who make art out of trash; and of course, as always, all the month’s cultural highlights, events, and more. This month we celebrate Israel’s 76 th Independence Day, and mark our Memorial Day for the Fallen Soldiers, Yom HaZikaron, though this year things will be different, as the country is still fighting to restore security in the north and south and release the hostages still captive in Gaza. As we hope for better days ahead, I wish you all a pleasant read and a peaceful flight.

At 175 meters above the Vigi River valley, it is in fact the highest in Europe, a magnificent engineering feat that can be walked on safely by everyone: experienced hikers, intrepid young people, as well as families and groups of friends. High up over the incredible scenery of Valnerina, a 30-45 minutes’ walk along the bridge connects you from the departure point in Sellano, one of Italy’s most beautiful medieval towns (an hour away from Perugia), to the hamlet of Montesanto.\n\nPhoto: Alex Kolomoisky, KKL-JNF\n\n6\n\nATMOSPHERE MAY 2024\n\nCheck-in I Local events I May 2024 I Nava Marton\n\nWhat’s On Our Radar This Month\n\nPerformative Arts | “Three” by Ohad Naharin The Israeli Opera, Tel Aviv\n\nChoreographer Ohad Naharin returns to “Three”, which he created for the Batsheva Dance Company in 2005. “Three” is a triptych comprised of three sections: Bellus, Humus, and Sekus. The tripartite theological structure suggests a return to a formal, exposed, everyday foundation of dance. Virtuosity is replaced by the simple movement, by rhythm, and unison, weaving the three sections into a delicate lacework of equilibriums between the empty spaces, silence, and pauses and the body, music, and movement. “Three” presents dance that is not afraid to be exposed and to expose, which does not apologize for its fragility, humanity, and excess.

This superb production is a riveting spectacle and a deep-dive into the most salient moments of Herzl’s life – his involvement in the fight against antisemitism, his complicated relationship with his wife Julie, and the challenges brought on by his vision of a Jewish State. The film will be distributed to various broadcasting bodies around the world.

To avoid long lines in crowded airports at peak hours, the best solution is to book a night flight. You might not get the best night’s sleep of your life, but you’ll save money on the ticket and get through check-in and the security check, in no time. Also, chances are the flight won’t be completely full and you’ll be able to find a whole row of empty seats all for yourself. 02 Check-in online. This will save you a lot of time and aggravation. You can select your seat whether for free or not and skip the long lines. Once you get to the airport, all you need to do is go through the security check and leave your luggage at the bag drop off points for your airline. To save even more time, download your boarding pass to your phone ahead of time.\n\n03 Choose your seat well. Whether window or aisle, choose your seat as you book your flight, or when you check in online. Make sure it’s at the front of the plane, away from the bathroom, close to the exit, or if you’re lucky, in the roomy exit row itself. If you don’t have a long legs problem, a window seat can give you a sense of privacy and the possibility to lean your head against the window to sleep a bit more comfortably. If you’re a person who needs to get up a lot during a flight, an aisle window is the best option. 04 Pack like a pro. Keep your passport, boarding pass, and phone in the bag you keep with you at all times, and your laptop, medication, change of clothes in a carry-on in the overhead bin. Remember not to have any metal objects (keys, small change, phone)\n\nin your pockets before going through the security check so that you don’t slow down the line or raise the suspicion of the security agents. 05 Always have a snack on you. Apart from a bottle of water, bring something to snack on, the healthier the better. Even though you can find plenty to eat at the airport, everything there is more expensive, and the choice is narrower. 06 Download useful apps . Make sure you download all the apps you’re going to need on your trip before you leave: get a weather app, a language app, a GPS navigation app, a currency converter app, an app with information on events happening at your destination, and of course, download your airline app so that you stay updated on your flight schedule.\n\n12 ATMOSPHERE MAY 2024\n\nCheck-in I Passport Control\n\nWhat’s your favorite kind of vacation? “My favorite kind is staying in a big city where I can combine culture, friends, and shopping. These past years, I’ve become obsessed with outlet villages that are usually located on the outskirts of big cities, such as La Vallée Village which is about 40 minutes away from Paris. It’s a giant shopping center with dozens of top brand stores selling items at reduced prices”. What do you always pack with you? “Music scores that I study 24/7, cigars, my skincare products,my vitamins and a suit and tie just in case there’s a formal event I need to attend”. What’s the first thing you do when you arrive at your destination? “If it’s somewhere new I immediately go out to explore the surroundings. If it’s somewhere I know well, I go back to the same places I’ve been loyal to for years. In Rome for instance, there’s a café in front of the Vatican I’ve been going to for cappuccinos for thirty years. Rome is where I studied as a I young man. In Paris there’s a cheese shop next to the Madeleine I love returning to”. Most memorable travel experience? “Once, in New Delhi, India, minutes before I was supposed to go on stage for a solo piano recital, with the prime minister of India in the audience, I was told that my grand piano had been left at the entrance of the concert hall and completely disassembled. The Indian movers who had brought it had not realized they also had to put it together, and as if that wasn’t enough, a cow suddenly appeared and began licking it”. Any destination recommendations? “The Caribbean island of Saint-Barth is the ultimate luxury holiday destination. I apologize if it sounds a tad ‘elitist’ but it’s such a great place that offers the perfect blend of luxury pampering, wonderful weather, and the most beautiful mountain and ocean views”.\n\nWhat does he pack in his suitcase, what happened to his grand piano in India, and where does he dream of going to? Pianist and conductor Gil Shohat shows us his passport / By Shani Altrovitch “The Caribbean island of Saint-Barth is the ultimate luxury holiday destination”\n\nGil Shohat, 50, lives with his partner and their eight-year-old twins. He’s been a pianist and a conductor for over 35 years, performed over 3,500 concerts across the world, and written 250 pieces, among which 9 symphonies, 15 concertos, and 3 operas. He’s produced hundreds of original shows that combine jazz, pop and world music. He has received 15 national and international awards, including the French title of Knight of Arts and Culture, and was chosen by Forbes magazine as well as by Israel’s leading newspapers, as Israel’s most important figure in the world of classical music.\n\nWhere do you dream of going? “On a real African safari.

Among other things, he financed the establishment of the first vineyards and wineries of the Jewish Yishuv, notably in Zichron Ya’akov, one of the first Jewish agricultural colonies and named in memory of the Baron’s father, James (Ya’akov). Zichron Ya’akov is also where the Baron and his wife Ada are buried.

The community established itself in Zichron Ya’akov, where it founded a factory that produces air filtration systems, notably for operating rooms. One of its other ventures has been the Carmel brand, which notably manages the Aunt Berta shop, a charming little shop situated right beside factory, that sells 100% natural jams and compotes, made using a special manufacturing process that maintains the taste and nutritional value of the fruit. Same goes for the salad dressings, sauces and condiments, also on sale here. Aunt Berta’s also has its own bakery that produces typical European baked goods such as pretzels, Linzer tortes, sourdough breads, etc., and in the visitors’ center next-door, you can hear all about the the community’s establishment and development in Zichron Ya’akov.

I offered to give him a hand and the rest is history”. Indeed from then on, Weiss became enthralled with the art of can sculpting. After the motorbike, he built a cart, a carriage, and on and on, constantly enhancing his sculpting skills as he went along. Today, some of his work can be seen at the Holon Children’s Museum where a permanent exhibition of his work has been on show for the last six years.\n\nNir Ohayon I Photo: Igal Bareket\n\nTreasures out of trash Nir Ohayon\n\n“I was a real garbage man as a kid”, jokes eco-artist Nir Ohayon, now 52, “we’d find industrial junk at the rubbish tip and play with it”. After the army, Ohayon began sculpting, making flowerpots with faces made of plaster and where the plant would serve as the hair. His flowerpots were a great success, and he took them to LA where he lived for eighteen months selling his creations at local street fairs. When he returned to Israel, he sold his flowerpots at the Tel Aviv Nahalat Binyamin street fair. When he started to get a little bored with the flowerpots, he moved on to making bigger sculptures and taking part in art shows. The first work\n\nhe exhibited was a chair made of recycled parts. He later went on to design a ten-meter couch for the Hiriya Ecological Education Center. “The greatest moment of all was when Janet Jackson saw one of my chairs and asked to use it in a clip”, says Ohayon, who has been participating in art shows in Israel and abroad since 2004. Most of the raw materials he uses in his work, he finds on his way from his home in Jaffa to his studio in the south of Tel Aviv, which is filled with his sculptures of animals and creatures of his invention, made of materials such as shoes, pieces of wood, tires, metal, and more.\n\nJoseph Weiss I Photo: Joseph Weiss\n\n22 ATMOSPHERE MAY 2024\n\nThe “From trash to treasure” art tour is part of journalist and entrepreneur Meital Katz’s social project that won the 2021 2022 European Travel & Hospitality Award.

In her vast studio, she creates sculptures out of paper using a special technique she developed herself over many years. “We may be in the digital age, but I still find it hard to say goodbye to the printed word and the physical touch of paper. I love paper”, she says. Born in Jerusalem in 1960, Ilan studied fashion design at Shenkar College, and at the Parsons School of Design in New York.

When he was 12, he made a picture frame with his father, and discovered a passion for woodwork. After a few years working as a forest ranger in Russia, he made Aliyah and in Israel he began working as a carpenter. His childhood memory with his father and his love for woodcarving led him to create beautiful sculptures, first keeping them at home, and then filling his workshop with them. Kredentser makes Judaica objects, sculptures of supernatural creatures, and more, mostly out of the driftwood he finds when he goes fishing on weekends.\n\nIgor Kredentser I Photo: Igal Bareket\n\nMaking art out of old auto parts Shmulik Mizrahi\n\nSixty-one-year-old mechanic Shmulik Mizrahi makes art out of old motorbike and car parts. Working at a big garage where he specializes in radiators and mufflers, he first developed a love for house plants. Clients began asking him for tips, bringing their ailing plants to the garage which soon became swamped with plants of every kind. In order to make space, he created plant holders out of the old parts lying about, and from then on, his passion for sculpting hasn’t waned. His first sculpture was of a Harley Davidson, and more and more came along, including of guitars, cars, animals, and more.\n\nShmulik Mizrahi I Photo: Ido Halevi\n\n23\n\nATMOSPHERE MAY 2024\n\nMagazine I Interview\n\nActress, producer, director, and fierce advocate for the rights of Israeli women in the wake of the October 7 attacks, Linor Abargil is hosting this year’s “Israel Prize” ceremony in Sderot, out of the belief that life must go on, and that perhaps now more than ever, change is possible / By Maya Cohen “I have to believe that in the end, things will be ok”\n\norganizations for their silence in the face of the collected testimonies and evidence. Being their voice “Like all of us, on October 7 th I awoke to a terrible reality, and I became restless”, she recounts. “I felt I had to do something. I needed to be the voice of those women who couldn’t speak. With a film crew, I began filming witness testimonies, even before there were testimonies of the victims themselves, and saw monstrous pictures of what had taken place. Then, testimonies of women who had been assaulted began to emerge. (See Abargil’s report, “Linor’s war”, broadcast by Channel 12). I contacted every women’s organization in the world, knocked on all the doors, and was met with total indifference. At least until one day, when I met a woman working for the UN, with a hidden camera in my bag. To my surprise, I was offered to come and speak at the UN”, she says. “I didn’t really know\n\nwhat I was going to say but I knew that as someone who has gone through a similar ordeal, I wanted to be the voice of the voiceless. I knew that if I spoke from the heart there was a chance people would listen. When I stood on that stage, I felt that all these past 26 years had been preparation for this moment. I never imagined my speech would reach so many. It taught me that every tiny effort can help bring change, and that words carry great power”. Standing strong When you see what’s happening in the world, that there are still many who don’t believe us about what took place – does it discourage you or does it motivate you to take action? “I believe that everything we do can help bring change, so I choose to take action. I also believe that after darkness comes light, and I see that people in Israel, people who weren’t particularly religious before, are embracing their Jewish identity. In no other place in the world have I seen such caring, kindness, and mutual support for fellow compatriots”. What are you currently involved in, in terms of advocacy for Israel?\n\nIn 1998, Linor Abargil was crowned Miss World. Six weeks before her crowning, she was kidnapped and raped in the outskirts of Milan by her travel agent. Since then, she has recounted her ordeal many times, believing that her personal story could help other women who experienced sexual violence, on their journey out of trauma and pain. Her voice has been a powerful one in the fight for female empowerment. Since October 7 th , as the sexual crimes perpetrated by Hamas against Israeli women have come to light, Abargil has become the ambassador of those women around the world, alerting international aid organizations of the rape and assault they have suffered. The response has mostly been a resounding silence, but last December she was invited to speak at the UN at a conference organized by Israel on the sexual violence committed by Hamas. In her speech which went viral, Abargil criticized international women’s\n\n“I’ve recently got back from an economics conference in Harvard where I recounted my personal story and underscored the fact that Israeli men and women are still being held captive in Gaza\"\n\n24 ATMOSPHERE MAY 2024\n\nOur quick questionnaire\n\nWhat makes you angry? “The silence of the world and of\n\nwomen’s organizations”. What makes you sad?\n\n“Knowing that the hostages are still being held captive all this time. It breaks my heart”. What makes you laugh? “My kids”. What makes you feel relaxed? “The sea”. What do people not know about you? “That I don’t take life too seriously”.\n\n“I’m still invited to talk in conferences. In a few weeks I’ll be speaking at a UN conference in Vienna. I’ve recently got back from an economics conference in Harvard where I recounted my personal story and underscored the fact that Israeli men and women are still being held captive in Gaza, more than six months after their brutal kidnap. It’s simply unfathomable”. Are you able to remain optimistic? “I have to believe that in the end, things will be ok. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to do what I do. I came to the UN without any expectations, and the fact is things did change. Two days after my speech, President Biden spoke about what happened to Israeli women in a speech he gave”. On this year’s Independence Day, Abargil will be hosting the “Israel Prize” ceremony. “I think that even though there’s a sense that there shouldn’t be celebratory ceremonies right now, life has to go on. Aside the pain and sadness, life has to be lived. In the end, to me, real victory is in continuing to live and to love life”. ˆ\n\nPhoto: Tali Moas\n\n25\n\nATMOSPHERE MAY 2024\n\nMagazine I Exhibition\n\nIsraeli photographer Erez Kaganovitz is presenting his “Humans of October 7 th ” project this month at the Embassy of Germany in Tel Aviv, with 30 photos that tell stories of heroism, hope, and solidarity.

From my experience, highlighting the human side provides a reminder of what Israeli society is all about and what we are actually\n\nfighting for. To do so, I’ve created the Humans of October 7 th project”. “The project is an ongoing photo exhibition that brings to light the human stories of the exceptional Israelis that stood up against terrorism.

With the Guide Michelin soon to reach Israeli shores, we’ve selected some of the most internationally recognized Israeli restaurants, in Israel and abroad, from New York to Paris, through Berlin and Tel Aviv / By Sharon Ben-David 8 internationally acclaimed Israeli restaurants around the world\n\nPhotos: lephotographedudimanche\n\nMatan Zaken, NOHMe, Paris One Michelin star At merely 31,\n\nFranco-Israeli chef Matan Zaken, has achieved the Holy Grail of the Michelin star at his Parisian\n\nrestaurant NOHMe. Zaken has been toing and froing between Paris and Tel Aviv since his was a boy. Born in Jerusalem, he moved to France with his family at the age of 12, went back at 18 to serve in the army, and then returned to Paris to follow his dream of becoming a chef. NHOMe is a blend of the most sophisticated French cuisine and the vibrancy of the Mediterranean table, the Israeli one in particular. The restaurant’s 9-course tasting menu is a celebration of diverse cooking techniques, French sophistication, Israeli flavors and playfulness.\n\nPhotos: Max Flatow\n\nEyal Shani, Shmone, New York One Michelin star\n\nAbout a month after the start of the war, as he was busy feeding IDF soldiers on the border with Gaza, Chef Eyal Shani, the indomitable prince of the Israeli culinary world, received the news that his New York restaurant Shmone had been awarded a Michelin star. Though he has restaurants in Vienna, Boston, Melbourne, and\n\nSingapore, not to mention a vast empire of casual-chic eateries in Tel Aviv and around it, Shmone is most definitely the jewel in Eyal Shani’s crown. It manages to serve up quintessential Israeli nosh in a way only this food magician can, with the humble tomato given center stage. As the Michelin Guide puts it: “many restaurants celebrate fresh top-quality produce, but Shmone takes it to a whole other level, with a changing daily menu that leaves an indelible mark in your memory, each dish being entirely unique”.\n\n28 ATMOSPHERE MAY 2024\n\nAssaf Granit, Shabour, Paris One Michelin star\n\nEL AL passengers won’t need any introductions to Chef Assaf Granit– why, you’re probably biting into one of his creations this very minute, as he is none other than our airline’s own head chef. But that is but one of his many titles. One\n\nof his restaurants, Shabour, is located in Paris’ second arrondissement, and has earned him a Michelin star for four years in a row now, becoming the Machneyuda Group’s most emblematic eateries. The menu is composed of brilliantly reinvented Israeli classics served on vintage porcelain plates in a buzzing atmosphere with an open kitchen, where operations are looked over by Chef Dan Yosha. French critics have been raving about the place, with the Figaroscope even naming it the best restaurant in Paris - and it’s got a Michelin star to prove it, for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nPhotos: Ilya, (Granit) Tami Bar Shai\n\nGal Ben-Moshe, Prism, Berlin One Michelin star\n\nThis is the fourth year in a row that Chef Gal Ben-Moshe and his Berlin restaurant Prism have received a Michelin star. No small feat, considering only 23 Berlin restaurants have been awarded a Michelin star,\n\nand it’s a true badge of honor for Ben Moshe and his partner Jacqueline Lorenz, the restaurant’s co-owner and head sommelier. Based on fresh seasonal produce, the menu mixes local cuisine with elements of the Japanese, Scandinavian, and Iraqi cuisine, Ben-Moshe’s grandmother being Iraqi. The attention brought to every detail, the subtle elegance and precision of the execution, did not escape the eye of the Michelin inspectors, who remarked that “beyond the brilliant gastronomical uniqueness, what is really impressive here is the personal touch, one that you won’t find anywhere else”.\n\nPhotos: (Dish) Steffen Sinzinger, (Ben-Moshe) Ben Fuchs\n\n29\n\nATMOSPHERE MAY 2024"
