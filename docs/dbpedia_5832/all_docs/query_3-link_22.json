        "text": "The Tel Aviv Jerusalem Fast Train, also known as the A1 train, is one of the most extensive infrastructure projects that the Israeli government has undertaken in the last decades. The project was initiated in 2001 and has been under planning and construction since, costing over NIS 8.5 billion (USD 2.4 billion). The A1 train route crosses the Green Line into the occupied West Bank in two areas, using occupied Palestinian land, some of it privately owned, for an Israeli transportation project aimed exclusively for Israelis.\n\nAs of May 2017, the rail route was paved until the Latrun area and the excavation of the tunnels and the construction of the bridges has ended. The works are currently focused on the electrification of the train route and on the train systems themselves. According to announcements by the Israeli Railways and the Israeli Ministry of Transportation, the project will become operational in March 2018.\n\nThe first segment of the route, completed in 2004, connected Tel Aviv with the Israeli Ben Gurion Airport. From the airport, the route continues to the Israeli city of Modi'in, when this segment became operational in 2007. The most expensive and complicated segment of the train route is from the Modi'in area to Jerusalem. This segment includes three long tunnels, a bridge of 1.2 km (bridge no. 6) and many shorter bridges in the area. The construction of this segment started in 2005 and is currently ongoing. In December 2016, the Israeli Ministry of Transportation and Israel Railways have approved the extension of the train route to an underground station in the Western Wall area in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe third segment of the route was divided into four sections: section A, from Anabe to Mevo Horon - executed by Danya Cebus; section B, from Latrun to Sha'ar Hagai - executed by Minrav and MosMetrostry; section C, from Sha'ar Hagai to the Cedars Valley - executed by Shapir Engineering and Impresa Pizzarotti; and section D, from the Cedars Valley to Jerusalem - executed by Electra-Bogl.\n\nThe electrification process is currently being executed by the Spanish company SEMI.\n\nCrossing the Green Line\n\nThe first area where the A1 train route crosses the Green Line into the occupied territory is in the Latrun Enclave. This segment was included in the original plan, issued in 1996 and approved in 2001. It is about three km long, starting at the end of the Ayalon Bridge (Bridge 6) and continuing with a tunnel (Tunnel 1). This tunnel, like the others, was excavated using a Tunnels Boring Machine (TBM) of the German company Herrenknecht.\n\nThe Latrun enclave was occupied in the 1967 war; the three Palestinian villages in it, Imwas, Yalu and Beit Nuba, were totally destroyed and their residents evicted. To prevent their return, the area has been declared a closed military zone ever since. Additionally, an Israeli settlement (Mevo Horon) separates the enclave from the rest of the West Bank and a large part of the area was declared a national park. Today, this main highway, called Israel's Road No. 1, goes through the Latrun Enclave. The Separation Wall was built east of the enclave inside the West Bank, leaving the entire Latrun Enclave on the Israeli side of the fence. When the Israeli military planning committee discussed objections filed by the Palestinian land owners in July of 2005, alternative routes to the A1 train route included one option further south, through the Ayalon Valley, within the borders of the State of Israel. The committee decided to dismiss this option because of possible environmental harm to the Ayalon Valley.\n\nThe second area in which the route crosses into the occupied West Bank is near the Palestinian villages of Bet Surik and Bet Iksa. The route in this area consists of a tunnel - the end of the long tunnel (Tunnel 3) that comes out into Cedars (Arazim) Valley, a bridge (bridge no. 9) over the valley and a second tunnel (Tunnel 3A). The train route in this area passes just 250-300 meters (850-1000 feet) north of the Green Line border into the occupied area. This infringement was not in the original plans. The original route went through the northernmost outskirts of the nearby Israeli town of Mevaseret Zion, with the tunnels opening to a bridge over Cedars Valley next to the houses of the Israeli neighborhood of Reches Halilim (lit. \"Flutes Ridge\"), which borders the Green Line.\n\nThe Israeli residents of Mevaseret filed objections to this plan, and demanded that the tunnel portals be moved at least 500 meters further north. Three fast trains an hour, going in and out of the mountain, would likely create serious noise pollution, destroy the view of the natural valley and consequently would decrease property value. The new route cuts into the lands of the neighboring Palestinian villages of Bet Iksa and Bet Surik, which lie on opposite sides of Cedars Valley. Additionally, access roads to all tunnel portals and waste removal tunnels, needed during the construction phase, seized more agricultural lands and crossed into village residents' private lands, in the western entrance to the Jerusalem.\n\nLegal Implications\n\nThe A1's exploitation of occupied land to enable Israeli development of a railway system for the sole benefit of the Israeli market and population stands in stark violation of international law.\n\nArticle 55 of the Hague Regulations designates the Occupying Power as only the administrator and usufructuary of public immovable properties such as land. Accordingly, Israel's use of land in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) is limited to mere administration, and it is only allowed to function as a trustee of occupied public property.[1] Hence, Israel is prohibited from exploiting the land in a manner that quashes the economy of the occupied population and benefits its own inhabitants or national economy.[2] In the case of the A1 fast train, not only does the appropriation of land undermine the Palestinian economy's development and growth, it also further exacerbates forcible displacement and hinders the access of Palestinians to their lands - the fundamental resource of agrarian income.\n\nMoreover, under the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) rules of usufruct, the Occupying Power is prohibited from using any of the land of an occupied territory for any purpose other than a military necessity.[3] As a civilian inter-city train in no way a military necessity, there is no legal justification for this blatant violation of international law.\n\nRather than being a military necessity, the above-mentioned railway project exclusively benefits the Israeli economy and population.\n\nCorporate Involvement\n\nThe overall plan includes what would be the longest and highest bridges and tunnels. This extensive project could not have materialized without foreign investment and know how of major multinationals. The following section focuses on some of the companies that execute the A1 project, describing their involvement in this controversial project, as well as their other occupation-related activities.\n\nThe Electra Group and Electra Bogl\n\nElectra is a publicly traded Israeli conglomerate of Israeli and international companies, specializing in the fields of electromechanical systems, real estate development and construction, facility management and large-scale infrastructure.\n\nOne of the group's subsidiaries, Electra Infrastructures Hofrey Hasharon, develops and builds several infrastructure projects in the occupied West Bank. It was contracted by Israeli Railways to build tunnel 3A in section D of the A1 train route, which crosses through occupied Palestinian land.\n\nOn February 2015, Electra and Electra Infrastructures Hofrey Hasharon won a tender for the construction and maintenance of the track and electronic systems of the A1 rail route. Both companies won the EUR 160 million tender as part of an international consortium, named the Electra Bögl Group and composed of the German company Max Bögl Stiftung & Co. and Swiss company Signon Schweiz. The construction includes laying 46 kilometers of track, setting up electromechanical systems that support railway operation, management and integration. The project started immediately after the signing of the contract and is due to be completed in December 2017. The maintenance services included in the contract will be provided by the consortium for a period of 10 years.\n\nOther occupation-related activities of the Electra Group:\n\nA fully owned subsidiary of the group, Ben Hasharon, has executed the planning and physical development of the expansion of the Barkan settlement industrial zone for the Samaria Development Co. The early stages of this project also included massive quarrying on the expansion site. The quarrying of Palestinian non-renewable natural resources for Israeli needs is another form of illegal exploitation.\n\nAnother fully owned subsidiary of the Electra Group, Katzenstein Adler, operates a 4,780 square meters factory in the Barkan settlement industrial zone in the West Bank.\n\nIn addition, Electra Construction has been involved in the construction of housing projects in West Bank settlements. The company built 141 housing units in the settlement neighborhood of Har Homa (Homat Shmuel) in occupied East Jerusalem and 52 housing unit is the settlement of Ma'ale Adumim. Electra Investments had also built a project in the settlement of Ma'ale Adumim in 2009.\n\nElectra Y.B., another fully owned subsidiary of the Electra group, is contracted by the Israeli Prisons Service (the IPS) to execute a biometric project, including maintenace, from 2016 until 2019 for NIS 1.24 million.\n\nThe company also owns Ariel Properties, whose malls division, Ariel Promol Malls Management, markets and manages a shopping center in Ramot, a settlement neighborhood in East Jerusalem.\n\nAdditional subsidiaries provide services to the Israeli Army, Israeli Police, the Ministry of Defense and other governmental bodies. In 2012, Electra Power won a tender for the construction, operation and maintenance of the new military training campus in the Negev (Naqab) desert - 'the Bahadim city'. This project, located within the green line, together with other plans, threaten to displace Bedouin communities living in the area. Electra FM supplies overall maintenance services to the Israeli Ministry of Defense headquarters' in Hakirya military base in Tel Aviv. Girit Control Systems and Communications provided communications and security systems to the Israeli police, the Israeli military and the Prime Minister's office.\n\nCorporate Information\n\nThe Electra Group is controlled by Elco Holdings, which holds 53.28% of company shares.\n\nChairman: Michael Zelkind CEO: Itamar Deutscher\n\nThe Group's major Israeli subsidiaries include: Electra Investments, Electra Power, PSP Investments, Electra Construction, Electra Infrastructure Hoftey Hasharon, Ben Hasharon, Electra FM, Girit Control Systems & Communications, Elco Contracting and Services, Kedar Air Conditioning, Katzenstein Adler, Y.B.
