The analysis of these remains attempts to determine what plants would have been grown in the garden in antiquity. Results indicated that the material recovered likely represented plants that had been preserved elsewhere in the area and then deposited in the garden to act as fertilizer. The remains were generally charred and were probably derived from fuel and/or waste deposits as it does not appear that the garden was catastrophically burned. Although it is difficult to ascertain garden variety plants under these preservation conditions, an analysis of the archaeobotanical data from the Petra Garden and Pool Complex addresses the questions of what and how plants functioned in the local and regional economy, and how the role of the garden changed through time, in addition to providing insight into the general environmental or ecological conditions present in southern Jordan from the Late Hellenistic through Late Byzantine/Post-Classical periods. Though ornamental species represent a small fraction of materials collected, the presence of these taxa may indicate their occurrence in the garden. Even if garden plants are not readily identifiable, this study aids in addressing the larger issues of trade, economy and environment of this ancient city, as well as the feasibility of identifying garden plants in antiquity.\n\nThe first part of the book presents archaeological evidence from the Prehistoric Aegean and onward, which demonstrates the existence of an enduring, highly valued and advanced prehistoric Aegean apiculture.

Some well known ceramic vessels from Knossos \"palace\" are identified here for the first time with beekeeping paraphernalia thus proving the existence of a systematic Minoan apiculture. In the second part, an alternative view is proposed for some of the most important scenes on Minoan and Mycenaean gold rings, seals, and clay sealings that have led Evans, Nilsson, and many others over the past century to various speculations regarding the nature of the Prehistoric Aegean religion. By applying a naturalistic context of interpretation on the depicted scenes, apiculture paraphernalia and practices are recognized, instead of the religious symbols of the \"sacred tree\", \"flying gods\", \"baetyls and birds epiphany of deities\", \"great goddess\", \"horns of consecration\", \"altars\", \"temenos\" and \"double axes\".\n\nThe authors conclude that established ideas about the prehistoric Aegean religion should be reconsidered, thus creating significant challenges for future research.\"\n\nThe history of Tauric Chersonesus, a colony of Heraclea Pontica, established on the coast of the Gerakleiskii Peninsula, lasted for two thousand years, from the fifth century BC to the fifteenth century AD.

During this period, many exciting events took place in this area. Especially interesting for researchers always were the initial centuries, when the chora was shaped and the polis lands were demarcated. These aspects have been addressed by a multitude of field researches and scholarly publications (Блаватский, 1953; Стржелецкий, 1961; Щеглов, 1978; Виноградов, Щеглов, 1990; Зубарь, 1993; Сапрыкин, 1994; Николаенко, 1999; 2001).\n\nIn the initial stage of Tauric Chersonesus, the colonists’ main task was the development of neighbouring areas to establish firm economy based on farming. It was the time of adaptation to local life conditions and of the searches for the best ways of use and protection of the neighbouring lands in the Gerakleiskii Peninsula, Inkerman Valley, and Balaklava Valley. In 400/350–375/350 BC, Tauric Chersonesus started the division of the neighbouring country in the Gerakleiskii Peninsula. At first, they demarcated the area of the Maiachnyi Peninsula, which formed the westernmost tip of the Gerakleiskii Peninsula. Soon after, 10,000 hectares of the Gerakleiskii Peninsula were demarcated into plots.\n\nThis division also foresaw the establishment of the system of defence of the chora as an important part of the polis territory, especially vulnerable to enemies’ aggression and plunder, which threatened Chersonese that its lands and provisions would be lost. The security to the region was provided by installation of forts in the demarcated area, without violation of its integrity. The fortified settlements on the isthmus of the Maiachnyi Peninsula on the west, in the Bermana Ravine on the south, in the Khomutova Ravine on the east, and on the Karan’ Hills (Bezymiannaia Hill) on the south-east are known at present. There were roads connecting these forts with Tauric Chersonesus and each other, going between the farming plots.\n\nМаячный полуостров является частью земледельческой округи античного Херсонеса, где сохранились строительные остатки оборонительных сооружений и жилых построек укрепленного поселения на перешейке, сельские усадьбы и специально созданные на земельных наделах агротехнические сооружения для успешного выращивания виноградной культуры на плато полуострова. Многие памятники известны еще с конца XVIII века. В XIX – начале ХХ в. были проведены раскопки отдельных участков оборонительной системы и внутренней планировки укрепления на перешейке, а на плато полуострова раскопано несколько усадеб и участков земельных наделов. В результате проведенных исследований возникли различные противоречивые представления о хронологии этого региона хоры и его роли в истории Херсонеса Таврического.\n\nВо второй половине прошлого века сразу несколько экспедиций продолжили здесь масштабные исследования. В течение последних 20 лет Гераклейская экспедиция музея-заповедника «Херсонес Таврический» под руководством автора также сосредоточила свое внимание на изучении памятников Маячного полуострова. Раскопки позволили уточнить хронологию оборонительной системы и внутренней застройки укрепленного поселения на перешейке. Достаточно интенсивно изучалась хора на самом полуострове. В ходе исследований территории укрепленного поселения на перешейке и площади земельных наделов использовались геофизические методы изысканий, в частности, электроразведка, что значительно пополнило наши знания о межевой системе этого региона хоры Херсонеса в античный период и позволило с большей уверенностью gриступить к ее воссозданию.\n\nИтогам многолетних раскопок Гераклейской экспедиции на Маячном полуострове и посвящена эта работа. Основная цель данного издания – археологическая характеристика укрепленного поселения на перешейке Маячного полуострова, земельных наделов и усадеб, расположенных на его плато, а также введение в научный оборот материалов, добытых раскопками.\n\nThe adoption of maize in northeastern North America is often seen as a catalyst for the development of settled village life.

In this review we develop a theoretical framework centered on shifting-balance theory (SBT) and domesticated landscapes through which to understand the context for the adoption of maize agriculture in the Northeast. We review micro- and macrobotanical evidence and stable carbon isotope data from various sources to reevaluate maize histories and adoption trajectories. These data are coupled with contributions of subregionally significant predecessor plants, such as those constituting the Eastern Agricultural Complex, and wild rice. We find no evidence for rapid transitions to settled village life as a result of maize adoption. Maize was grown for centuries before settled village agricultural systems evolved. It was grown for a sufficiently long time that the potential for local selection leading to Northern Flint is a viable working hypothesis. We call for a refocusing of research questions and a systematic application of contemporary techniques as a means by which to strengthen future inferences based on comparative information sets.\n\nEN- In addition to being the most difficult to understand, the history of ancient times has been a subject that human beings are curious about.

One of the first questions that a reader interested in this history will ask is what people fed or earned their livelihood in ancient times. Most of the peoples living in the Mediterranean countries in antiquity were communities engaged in agriculture, especially under the conditions offered by the climate and geography of the period, who produced grain or imported and exported. Considering the position of human beings in history and their efforts in relation to this, it has a wide research subject, so it has been narrowed and the Late Republic Period, Pax Romana Period and B.C . III. From the first starting point, especially on the basis of Rome, in the 19th century, it is necessary to examine and examine the maritime nations or, in other words, the coastal cities of the Mediterranean, and how they carry out grain agriculture, production, where they are in the food chains and how they make their deliveries in exports or imports.\n\nTR- Antikçağ tarihi anlaşılması en güç tarih olmasının yanı sıra insanoğlunun merak ettiği de bir konu olmuştur. Bu tarihle ilgilenen bir okuyucunun soracağı ilk sorulardan biri de antik dönemde insanların ne ile beslendiği veya geçimlerini ne ile sağladıklarıdır. Antikçağda Akdeniz ülkelerinde yaşayan çoğu halk tarımla uğraşmış, özellikle dönemin iklim ve coğrafyasının sunduğu şartlar altında tahıl üretiminde bulunmuş veya ithalat ve ihracatını gerçekleştirmiş topluluklardır. İnsanoğlunun tarihteki konumu ve buna ilişkin uğraşları baz alındığında oldukça geniş bir araştırma konusuna sahip olduğundan dolayı daraltmaya gidilerek Geç Cumhuriyet Dönemi, Pax Romana Dönemi ve M.S. III. yüzyıl içerisinden özellikle Roma baz alınarak ilk başlangıç noktasından itibaren denizci ulusları veya diğer bir deyimle Akdeniz’e kıyısı kentlerini ele alıp, incelemek ve tahıl tarımını, üretimini, besin zincirlerinde nerede yer aldığını ve ihracat veya ithalatta sevkiyatlarını nasıl gerçekleştirdiklerini adım adım izlemek gerekir.\n\nThere is clear evidence for degrees of uniformity in specific types of material culture that were used across the large area occupied by the populations that comprised the Indus Civilization.

There is also evidence that there was considerable cultural\n\ndiversity across its environmentally varied extent. J. Mark Kenoyer and others have described the cultural material that is\n\nwidely attested across this area as a veneer that overlays a considerable degree of variation in material use and practices (e.g.\n\nMeadow and Kenoyer 1997). The tension between uniformity and diversity has significant ramifications for our understanding\n\nof a range of social, economic, and even political factors relating to Indus populations in the periods before, during and after\n\nSouth Asia’s first period of urbanism. This contribution considers the range of variability inherent during these periods by\n\nassessing the diversity evident in four different categories of data, and the relationships between those datasets.\n\nThe urban site of Caesarea Maritima located on the Mediterranean coast of modern Israel was founded by King Herod and dedicated to emperor Caesar Augustus between 22 and 10 BCE.

The site subsequently went through many phases of occupation generally classified as Roman, Late Roman (Byzantine), Early Islamic, Crusader, and Mamluk in which cultural and settlement size transitions occurred. This paper offers an analysis from this culturally significant site of the plant remains recovered from three specific areas of Caesarea (Arabic - Qaysariyya) during the Islamic period of occupation from 640 CE – 1101 CE under the Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid dynasties. The Combined Caesarea Expeditions, or CCE, devoted significant attention to archaeobotanical research and recovered samples from several excavation sectors across the site, specifically for the present study areas TP, the Temple Platform; and LL, a warehouse quarter. Although the goals of CCE’s project were to study monuments of the Roman and Late Roman (Byzantine) city, a dense Early Islamic domestic occupation was identified that had succeeded the ancient occupation. From these contexts 203 sediment samples were processed by water flotation, 106 of which contained plant remains. There were 9972 specimens examined from 63 different taxa. The archaeobotanical and supplementary documentary evidence examined clearly demonstrates that that population of Islamic Caesarea put significant investments into local agriculture, carrying on a tradition of practices that likely pre-dated Islam by many centuries.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to introduce a reading of Psalm 126 as a prayer of the Feast of Booths a fall festival in the ancient Near East, that petitions God for rain and an abundant harvest.

Because the Feast of Booths takes place between the dry and rainy seasons, it is probable that the ancient Israelites offered this prayer on this holiday as a way of bidding for a smooth transition between the seasons.\n\nFor the purpose, this paper (1) explores the history of the interpretation of Psalm 126, and offers a conventional translation and a reading of the Psalm, (2) discusses several characteristic features of the collection of the Songs of Ascent (Pss 120-134), (3) examines its association with pilgrimage and autumn, or the beginning of the rainy season. Finally, based on the preceding analysis, this paper attempts a reading of Psalm 126 as a song for the Feast of Booths liturgy.\n\nThe collection of the Songs of Ascent has philological, formulaic, and thematic evidence for its designation as Pilgrim Songs composed during the Persian period, and some scholars find additional allusions to the Feast of Booths within the collection. The seasonal and climatic pattern of the Levant was vital to the agriculture and religion of the eastern Mediterranean region (e.g., the Demeter myth and the Ba’alu cycle). Psalm 126 offers a number of images that are related to the climatic and agricultural pattern of the region. These images include: the invocation of Negev wadi’s flowing waters (vs. 4), the farmers’ sowing seeds in expectation of an abundant harvest (vss. 5-6), and, less directly, God’s restoration of fortunes (or seasons) (vss. 1, 4) and the feast of joy and gladness (vss. 2-3) that recalls the observance of the Feast of Booths in Nehemiah 8, and so on.\n\nThe reading suggested here has many advantages over the translations and readings that have previously been suggested. First, this reading explains the trajectory of the textual changes of Psalm 126 through time. Second, this reading can explain the complexity of the verbal usages in verses 1-4. Third, this reading enables the reader to understand how the Israelites used Biblical texts to engage in the climatic pattern of the ancient Israel.\n\nThe site of Nahal Haggit is an ancient farming community situated in the Ramot Menashe region, south of the Carmel Range.

Its stratigraphic sequence consists of three levels, dating from the Early Roman (Stratum I), Middle Roman (Stratum II; the main level at the site) and Mamluk (Stratum III) periods.\n\nThe remains of the Early Roman period are extremely limited It dates on the basis on the finds (pottery, glass and coins) from the first century BCE to the first century CE. From the little we could assess, there seems to have been at least a rectangular building, measuring 17 × 23 m, located at the center of the site. The miqva’ot provide a clear ethnic and chronological indicator that was confirmed by the finds, suggesting that the site was occupied by a Jewish or Samaritan family. A building of that size and location would most likely have functioned as a farm.\n\n- The major period of occupation at the site belongs to Stratum II of the Roman Period this stratum, dated by abundant ceramics and coin finds to date this stratum from the late 2nd. century till the end of the 3rd. century / beginning of the 4th. century C.E. It consists of a huge well planned structure displaying clear functional division of the space. The complex is surrounded by a square enclosure wall (89 X 89 metres and 1 metre wide), entered through a single gate. Inside the external walls are two rows of rooms that abut the inside face around much of the complex. These rooms interconnect and form individual functional spaces made up of a number of rooms. Within the rooms were milling installations, baths and large quantities of finds, especially pottery.\n\nWithin the central courtyard were buildings built in at least four groups, but sub-divided into individual houses and an olive oil press consisting of a single crushing basin and two pressing units using different technologies.\n\nDespite the architectural similarity to the plans of castella of the limes of Provincia Arabia, Nahal Haggit was agricultural in nature. We reached the conclusion that the Roman period site was a rural farm settlement with meticulously ordered architecture displaying centralised planning or control. The lines are straight and indicate planned construction rather than organic growth. Parallels to farm buildings of this plan were absent from the Palestinian archaeological record, with greater similarity with military architecture and we know that veterans were settled in areas evacuated by the Jews following the defeat of Bar Kochba. Would is be to bold to suggest that Nahal Haggit was given to a veteran in the 2nd. century as a farm in the hinterland of Caesarea. The farm built by the veteran was in an architectural plan with which he was familiar – the castellum. Such fortified villas, that are the direct legacy of the castrum, are known from various sites in the Roman empire.\n\nThe final period of settlement, after a long period of abandonment, is dated to the Mamluke period, from the 13th. to 14th. centuries C.E. The resettlement of the site in the Mamluke period lacked the spatial organisation that characterised the earlier occupations. A series of rooms of no particular plan were built clustered together in the south-east quarter of the site. The cemetery was cut into the levels of the earlier period elsewhere on the site.\n\nSince we are dealing with installations that have distinct and quite unique typological characteristics, they could ostensibly be considered installations that were built in the same period. Despite this, the excavation and survey results... more\n\nSince we are dealing with installations that have distinct and quite unique typological characteristics, they could ostensibly be considered installations that were built in the same period. Despite this, the excavation and survey results indicate the prolonged use of the installations, which first began in the Early Roman period and continued until the Byzantine period.\n\nRollers were also founding in two complex wine presses where there is screw-press type installation: one at Geva, on the slopes of the Carmel in the Jezreel Valley, which is dated to the Late Roman period (No. 28 in the table) and the other is a complex wine press at Bet Dagan that dates to the Byzantine period (No. 41 in the table).\n\nThe rollers that were discovered in various excavations seemed to several scholars to be foreign elements that have nothing to do with wine production and therefore the installations where the rollers were found were often interpreted as other kinds of production installations and not as wine presses. The current state of research has reached a point where one can no longer doubt that these installations are wine presses. The main arguments for this are:\n\n1. The similarity between them and rock-hewn wine presses, and the existence of the basic wine press components in their vicinity: treading floor and collecting vat.\n\n2. Similar installations were discovered in different regions of the country and it is therefore clear they were used for the production of a product that was widespread and known throughout the country. The possibility that they were intended for the production of oil, which is also a very common product, did not stand up to the test of criticism.\n\n3. The existence of rollers at what are unmistakably wine presses, such as those at Bet Dagan and Geva, corroborates the proposed connection between the rollers and the production of wine.\n\nBased on the aforementioned reasons the suggestion that these installations were used to produce a product that was exclusive to a particular region such as date wine (Netzer 2002) or persimmon products (Hirschfeld 2004, Bèlis 2006) should be rejected.\n\nABSTRACT: This lecture examines mid-late Dynasty 11, starting with Montuhotep II, the conflict with the rival northern kingdom (the Herakleopolitans), and reunification.

The lecture poses and attempts to address various questions: Why did the Theban kingdom feel the need to reunite all of Egypt? (i.e., a return to glory days of ED-OK Egypt? Ancestral linkage to OK? Abydos?); How did the Theban kingdom (i.e., Montuhotep II) reunify all Egypt? ca.2040 BC?; What territories did the northern enemy kingdom control? Middle Egypt only?; What evidence is used to recreate this process of re-unification? Texts? Archaeology?; Having re-unified all Egypt, what else did Montuhotep II do, if at all, to recreate/draw upon the “Old Kingdom”?; (i.e., subduing frontier peoples; grand building projects; adopting Old Kingdom art forms); How did Montuhotep II reward his followers? loyal officials within Southern Egypt?; How did Montuhotep II treat the defeated enemy ruler(s) & northern governors?; What evidence do we have for preferential treatment of Southern Egyptians?; What major innovation occurs regarding Montuhotep II’s mortuary complex? (i.e., How is it similar to and dissimilar to Old Kingdom pyramid complexes?); What evidence do we have for the last rulers of Dynasty 11? Montuhotep III-IV?; How does Dynasty 11 end? Why does it disintegrate? No heir? Civil war? Etc.; What important data can we glean from the surviving Middle Kingdom literary sources? (i.e., Using diverse textual sources appropriately as “historical sources”). The Heqanakht papers/letters provide a reference to famine and cannibalism (to the south of Thebes), and also daily life intrigues, household administration, and farming practices in southern Egypt. The lecture also provides an example of some Coffin texts using the tomb of Nakht-Ankh, and summarizes important pieces of Middle Kingdom literature, with a focus on two pieces for student reading (e.g., Tale of the Eloquent Peasant [i.e., regional trade; justice; law]; Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor [sailing; Red Sea; Punt]). UPDATED: April 7, 2023: This lecture was edited, reformatted in some areas, and had a few new slides added (especially in a selected bibliography at the end).\n\nSince their domestication in the Mediterranean zone of Southwest Asia in the eighth millennium BC, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle have been remarkably successful in colonizing a broad variety of environments.

The initial steps in this process can be traced back to the dispersal of farming groups into the interior of the Balkans in the early sixth millennium BC, who were the first to introduce Mediterranean livestock beyond its natural climatic range. Here, we combine analysis of biomolecular and isotopic compositions of lipids preserved in prehistoric pottery with faunal analyses of taxonomic composition from the earliest farming sites in southeast Europe to reconstruct this pivotal event in the early history of animal husbandry. We observe a marked divergence between the (sub)Mediterranean and temperate regions of Southeast Europe, and in particular a significant increase of dairying in the biochemical record coupled with a shift to cattle and wild fauna at most sites north of the Balkan mountain range. The findings strongly suggest that dairying was crucial for the expansion of the earliest farming system beyond its native bioclimatic zone.\n\nThe rural archaeological site of Horvat Haluqim is situated in the central Negev desert (Cohen 1976, Bruins 1986).

Average annual rainfall is about 90 mm and the region is too dry for agriculture. However, in ancient times series of cross-channel stone terrace walls were built in suitable dry valleys to capture runoff/floodwaters from local rainfall. Thus soil moisture of the terraced fields could be increased to enable agriculture in the desert. A remarkable cultural landscape developed through time as a result in the central Negev with thousands of stone terrace walls in numerous dry stream channels (Evenari et al. 1982, Bruins 2012). Three basic landscape elements are required to enable such farming in the desert (Bruins and Ore 2009). (1) Runoff contributing areas in the valley catchment suitable to generate runoff during local rainfall, i.e. the infiltration rate on the slopes has to be lower than the rainfall intensity. (2) Appropriate topography and geomorphic surface characteristics to enable sustained flow of runoff water to the terraced agricultural fields in the valleys. (3) Stone terrace walls capable to arrest runoff/floodwaters and valley soils of suitable texture and depth to store sufficient water in the root-zone for use by agricultural crops.\n\nThis article presents a review of the data collected from the palynological analysis of six sites situated on the southern edge of the Armorican Massif (coastal Vendée, Western France).

A multi and interdisciplinary approach, involving branches as diverse as archaeology, history, geography, geomorphology, sedimentology, climatology and the natural sciences, enabled us to gain an understanding of the evolution of vegetation and coastal ecosystems from the end of the Preboreal period to the present, and to see whether this evolution was due to the combined influence of climate and geomorphology of the environment or due to the influence of natural factors, human-induced processes or interaction between these components.\n\nSince the Preboreal, the coastal area has undergone significant geomorphological changes through a succession of marine transgressions and regressions. Coastal valleys filled up rapidly to the Atlantic and the progressive development of dune ridges led to the clogging of lagoons, resulting in the present day tidal marshes. On the first hillsides of the coastal area, and with improvement in climate conditions, a woodland environment rapidly appeared which had distinctive features related to the proximity of the ocean. These data reinforce the research already carried out on the subject and help in an understanding of the evolution of coastal and continental ecosystems. From the end of the Mesolithic period this woodland ecosystem saw clearance activities which were sometimes followed by the cultivation of such plants as cereals or walnut. The discovery of this type of occurrence is not an isolated case in continental Europe. However, the date of these occurrences raises numerous questions about the earliest stages of neolithization, about the diffusion of agricultural knowledge and the factors leading to this diffusion.\n\nThe possibility that legumes were specifically cultivated as a separate fodder crop in ancient Egypt has been inferred, usually on the basis of abundance of both legume seeds and / or dung in charred macro-botanical samples, combined with... more\n\nThe possibility that legumes were specifically cultivated as a separate fodder crop in ancient Egypt has been inferred, usually on the basis of abundance of both legume seeds and / or dung in charred macro-botanical samples, combined with a lack of wood charcoal; the implication being that a scarcity of wood led to the use of dung as fuel, and that the legumes in the assemblage derive from livestock which had been fed with cultivated fodder. The archaeobotanical remains from excavations at the Old Kingdom ‘Khentkawes town’ (2300-2100 BC) on the Giza plateau in Egypt contained an abundance of legumes, but also much wood charcoal, and preservation of many fragile and ‘green’ seeds and plant parts. This assemblage has led to questioning of the theory of specific fodder cultivation in Pharaonic Egypt. In this article, alternative interpretations of legume-rich assemblages of cereal processing by-products are investigated. Intercropping of legumes with cereals is one of the most widespread and effective methods of improving crop value and security, and fodder/forage quality. Analysis of this assemblage has led to a hypothesis that Trifolium sp. and other ‘weeds’ may well have been viewed as integral plants within ancient Egyptian cereal fields, due to an awareness of the benefits of intercropping legumes with cereals - as opposed to having been specifically cultivated as a monocrop.\n\nThe aim of this archaeobotanical study is to gain an understanding of how population increase affected the scale of agricultural production during the Nabataean, Roman and Byzantine periods in the arid regions of southern Jordan. The... more\n\nThe aim of this archaeobotanical study is to gain an understanding of how population increase affected the scale of agricultural production during the Nabataean, Roman and Byzantine periods in the arid regions of southern Jordan. The examination of archaeobotanical material from the sites of Petra, Humayma, Bir Madhkur, Aila and 'Ayn Gharandal provide evidence of local agricultural in the form of cereal grains, chaff and associated weed species. These analyses have identified at least two varieties of wheat (Triticum aestivum, T. aestivo-compactum and cf. T. durum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), rye (Secale sp.) and millet (Setaria sp.), as well as several legumes, such as lentils (Lens culinaris), chick pea (Cicer arietinum) and bitter vetch (Vicia ervilla). There is also considerable evidence in the assemblages of crop by-products (e.g. chaff, culm and rachis segments) and weeds specific to crop fields (e.g. Lolium temulentum, Chenopodium album, Malva sp. and Medicago sp.), which supports the likelihood of successful local agricultural in this arid region occurring in antiquity. The environmental conditions of the southern desert and highland regions of southern Jordan that encompasses the study sites has not changed significantly since the Nabataean, Roman and Byzantine periods and yet the sites are either surrounded by ancient agricultural fields or show likely evidence of local production (e.g. Aila and 'Ayn Gharandal). It appears that water management in antiquity in southern Jordan was more advanced than is currently recognized since there is a lack of modern cereal agriculture in these regions. The results of this study aid in illuminating the changes to the landscape of southern Jordan brought about by local agricultural production that would have been necessary to support a rise in population brought about by an increase in Roman military presence during the Roman/ period, as well as the production potential of dry-land agricultural techniques in such arid environments. 1 With appreciation and gratitude I would like to acknowledge the support and encouragement Tom has generously given to me over the years. He is not only a wonderful mentor and colleague but also a true friend. I count myself lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from him and work with him in the field. Tom has always been gracious with both praise and constructive criticism, always making me strive to do better, which I am trying to perfect with my own students. And finally, when all else fails I could always manage to twist his arm for a pop.\n\nFirst evidences of industrial vine agriculture in Iberian Peninsula are contemporary to the presence of Phoenician and Greek colonies.

Furthermore, archaeological evidence indicates a direct relationship between colonial foundations and early native communities with a consolidated wine production, fact that seem to be confirmed by palaeocarpologic, pollen and antracological analysis, due to evidence that analyzed vine remains from different archaeological sites have documented the presence of this crop after bronze Age, but this presence is quite uncertain for earlier dates.\n\nAnyway, there is a clear increase in the frequency and quantity of remains of Vitis vinifera from the bronze Age, being this increase deepest in Iberian period.\n\nAt the same time of the introduction of grape cultivation and wine production in Iberian Peninsula,\n\nthe imbedment of farming and development of the product techniques took place.\n\nAs far as wine production is concerned, in addition to written sources, it is possible to count on many archaeological remains which show the way iberian people developed the production of wine grapes before harvest and help to understand the multiple procedures from the arrival of the grapes at the winery until the packaging of the produced wine for a later distribution and consumption.\n\nIn settler colonial settings, agriculture is a means of reclaiming territorial sovereignty and indigenous identity.

Turning attention to the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and their multiple uses and abuses of organic farming, this article explores epistemic and political spatial operations on the colonial frontier. Applying a relational conceptualization of three spatial modalities-soil, territory, and land-we explore the ways in which these modalities serve as political apparatuses: Soil designates the romantic perception of cultivable space, territory is concerned with borders and political sovereignty, and land is seen as a space of economic value and as a means of production. While agriculture is a well-known instrument of expansion and dispossession, organic farming contributes to the colonial operation by binding together affective attachment to the place, and new economic singularity in relation to environmental and ethical claims. We argue that organic farming practices converge claims for local authenticity, spatial appropriation, and high economic values that are embedded in what we term the colonial quality turn. Ultimately, organic farming in the West Bank normalizes the inherent violence of the colonial project and strengthens the settlers' claim for political privilege.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02637758211041121?journalCode=epda\n\nSince their domestication in the Mediterranean zone of Southwest Asia in the eighth millennium BC, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle have been remarkably successful in colonizing a broad variety of environments.

The initial steps in this process can be traced back to the dispersal of farming groups into the interior of the Balkans in the early sixth millennium BC, who were the first to introduce Mediterranean livestock beyond its natural climatic range. Here, we combine analysis of biomolecular and isotopic compositions of lipids preserved in prehistoric pottery with faunal analyses of taxonomic composition from the earliest farming sites in southeast Europe to reconstruct this pivotal event in the early history of animal husbandry. We observe a marked divergence between the (sub)Mediterranean and temperate regions of Southeast Europe, and in particular a significant increase of dairying in the biochemical record coupled with a shift to cattle and wild fauna at most sites north of the B...\n\nThis study presents archaeobotanical data that allow for a better understanding of the scale and timing of local agricultural production at the ancient site of Bir Madhkur, which lies in the hinterland of the ancient Nabataean capital of... more\n\nThis study presents archaeobotanical data that allow for a better understanding of the scale and timing of local agricultural production at the ancient site of Bir Madhkur, which lies in the hinterland of the ancient Nabataean capital of Petra, Jordan. The desert of the Wadi Araba region that encompasses Bir Madhkur has not changed significantly since its occupation in antiquity and is surrounded by ancient agricultural fields and associated farmhouses. Analysis of the archaeobotanical remains recovered from 62 soil samples taken during the 2008 excavation season address questions related to how and when plants were grown and what role they played in the local and regional economy. This analysis has identified two varieties of wheat (Triticum aestivum and T. aestivo-compactum), barley (Hordeum vulgare) and several legumes, such as lentils (Lens culinaris). There is also considerable evidence in the assemblage of crop by-products (chaff) and weeds specific to crop fields, which support successful local agriculture having occurred during Late Roman/Byzantine period (A.D. 284-500). The archaeobotanical identifications from Bir Madhkur provide direct evidence of increase in agricultural production during the Late Roman/Byzantine period and aid in illuminating the production potential of dry-land agricultural and its significance to populations living in arid environments."
