This stretches from developing breakthrough technologies and solutions, to bold thinking in our novel financial models.\n\nLeveraging our profound know-how and proven experience, we work closely with global customers to create sustainable, economically viable, water treatment and reuse solutions. We also structure project financing to meet customers’ specific criteria.\n\nBy promoting the circular economy and creating financial and environmental value from water, we transform water challenges into opportunities for growth.\n\nWater production is impeded by mineral scaling on membranes during desalination. ROTEC’s proprietary Flow Reversal prevents mineral scaling by regularly switching the saline stream flow direction. This significantly increases water production and reduces brine, while minimizing the eco-footprint of the desalination plants and enhancing their performance. Whether you’re looking to retrofit an existing desalination facility risk-free, or to implement a new project, ROTEC will help you achieve more with water.\n\nIndustry, public utilities and municipalities are often forced to choose between discarding polluted water or investing in industrial effluent treatments that aren’t economically viable. ToxSorb changes the paradigm with MAC technology, providing drinking water and industrial wastewater treatment solutions that are both cost effective and environmentally sound. By minimizing brine haulage and chemicals consumption, regenerating substances, and precisely extracting pollutants for conversion into profitable assets, ToxSorb reduces eco-footprint, decreases costs to near zero and promotes the circular economy."
