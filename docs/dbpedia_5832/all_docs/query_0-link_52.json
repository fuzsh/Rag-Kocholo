        "text": "A major list of the world’s wildest natural treasures was just expanded—although a number of sites were also removed.\n\nThe International Coordinating Council of the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), meeting this week in Paris, added 23 new sites to the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), a program of the United Nations.\n\nProposals for 28 new reserves and site extensions in 22 countries were considered (11 of those reserve extensions were approved and one reserve was renamed). Previously, the network consisted of 669 sites in 120 countries.\n\nAt the same time, the council approved requests by the U.S. and Bulgaria to remove some of those countries’ biosphere reserves from the official list. The U.S. withdrew 17 sites (out of the country’s previous total of 47 sites), and Bulgaria withdrew three. Prior to this year, a total of 18 sites had been removed from the program since 1997, by seven countries.\n\nIn statements emailed to National Geographic, UNESCO and U.S. State Department officials said that the 17 sites in question voluntarily withdrew from the program, but some are planning to re-enter at a later date. Nineteen sites in the U.S. remain fully compliant with the UNESCO biosphere-reserve designation, and ten others are under review.\n\n“Withdrawal is not unusual and other countries have withdrawn sites in the past (the U.K., Austria, Australia, Norway, Bulgaria, Sweden), often because there was no human population in the reserves or because of lack of support from local communities,” says UNESCO spokesperson Agnès Bardon in a statement.\n\n‎Vernon Gilbert, a former UNESCO official and the head of the non-profit U.S. Biosphere Reserves Association, says that beginning in the late 1990s, some U.S. advocacy groups and politicians decried the program as a threat to U.S. property rights and sovereignty.\n\nThe blowback hamstrung the country’s participation in UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Programme, which designates the reserves. A 2005 Congressional investigation into the affiliated U.S. program, spearheaded by Congressman Richard Pombo (R-CA), didn’t help matters.\n\nIn recent years, Gilbert says that the U.S. has renewed participation in the program. However, after more than a decade of relative inaction, some of the U.S. reserves were behind on meeting UNESCO guidelines and review schedules, leading some to decide for now against maintaining the designation.\n\n“There’s a lot of activity now, but not nearly what we had,” says Gilbert. “There were some agencies and some areas that thought, ‘This is not worth it,’ and I can’t blame them… But it is, because biosphere reserves help to conserve important natural areas and the genetic material they contain.”\n\nWithdrawn sites can rejoin the network at any time according to biosphere reserve guidelines, and UNESCO spokespersons say they expect some to resubmit for membership as early as September. The U.S. sites include a mix of national forests, preserves, and reserves, from Alaska to the Virgin Islands (see a complete list below)\n\nBiosphere reserves are areas comprising terrestrial, marine, and coastal ecosystems and are designated “learning places” for testing different sustainable approaches, UNESCO said in a news statement.\n\nEach reserve also aims to reconcile biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources.\n\nLaunched in the early 1970s, the Man and the Biosphere Programme aims at improving people’s relationship with their environment, targeting the ecological, social, and economic dimensions of biodiversity loss and the reduction of this loss, UNESCO said.\n\nEach year, new sites are designated by the MAB Council. Biosphere reserves are nominated by national governments and remain under the sovereign jurisdiction of the states where they’re located.\n\nThe following Biosphere Reserves joined the network this year (the following information is reprinted from UNESCO’s official press release):\n\nMono Biosphere Reserve (Benin)—Located in the southwest of the country, this 9,462-ha site comprises ecosystems that include mangroves, wetlands, savannah and forests. It is home to notable biodiversity flagship species such as the dugong, or sea cows, hippos and two monkey species. Nearly 180,000 inhabitants live within the reserve, mostly from livestock and small-scale farming of palm oil and coconuts, as well as fishing.\n\nMono Transboundary Biosphere Reserve (Benin/Togo)—Located in the southern parts of Benin and Togo, the 346,285 ha. site stretches over the alluvial plain, delta and coast of the Mono River. It brings together Benin’s and Togo’s national biosphere reserves of the same name and features a mosaic of landscapes and ecosystems, mangroves, savannahs, lagoons, and flood plains as well as forests, some of which are sacred. The biosphere reserve is home to some two million people, whose main activity is small-scale farming (palm oil and coconuts), livestock grazing, forestry and fishing.\n\nSavegre Biosphere Reserve (Costa Rica)—This site is located on the central Pacific coast, 190 km from the capital, San José. This reserve has high biodiversity value, hosting 20 percent of the total flora of the country, 54 percent of its mammals and 59 percent of its birds. It has approximately 50,000 inhabitants, whose main activities are agriculture and livestock rearing. Crop production is significant in high altitude areas, including plantations of apple, pomegranate and avocado. During recent years, ecotourism has increased and has become a source of socio-economic growth in the region.\n\nMoen Biosphere Reserve (Denmark)—This reserve consists of a series of islands and islets in the southern Baltic Sea, over approximately 45,118 ha. Its landscapes include woodlands, grasslands, meadows, wetlands, coastal areas, ponds and steep hills.
