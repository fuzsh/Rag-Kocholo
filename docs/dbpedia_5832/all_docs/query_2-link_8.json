        "text": "The collared pithos has attracted the attention of many scholars and archaeologists for nearly seventy years, largely owing to its reputation as a container associated with the emer­gence of Israel during the Iron I period. However, though it is one of the most discussed vessels appearing in the ceramic assemblage of ancient Israel, its significance is still poorly understood. This paper re-examines the collared pithos in the archaeological record. Two sites where collared pithoi have appeared, Beit Shean and Giloh, are showcased here as representing two different phenomena associated with the appearance of this vessel. A typology is proposed for the collared pithos, and an examination of its context and provenience is summarized.\n\nFor various reasons, large storage vessels rarely attract the attention of pottery specialists. It is quite remarkable that prehistoric pithoi from the Greek mainland have not received a thorough treatment so far, in contrast to their Cretan or Cypriot counterparts. the article attempts to fill partially the gap and to show the potential of such a study for approaching wider issues of social, economic, and political developments of LBA/eIA Central Greece. The majority of the pithoi derive from the site of Mitrou. Fragments from two other sites located nearby—the settlement of Kynos and the sanctuary at Kalapodi—complete our dataset. The outstanding characteristic of these pithoi is their size and decoration, consisting of designs made by impressions of a toothed tool. Macroscopic analysis of fabrics supports the existence of several workshops serving more than a single site. various lines of interpretation of the distributional pattern and the sudden rise of this type of pithos (and pithoi in general) at the LBA/eIA transition are suggested and elaborated\n\nThe paper presents the first results of investigations on craftsmanship of big storage pithoi found in domestic contexts at the Early Helladic settlement of Helike, Achaea, in the NW Peloponnese, Greece. Beyond describing the conspicuously standardized morphological qualities in terms of profile, surface treatment and building techniques that pertain to these vessels, we have carried out detailed petrography, SEM and XRD analyses which suggest that regularized methods in their clay recipes and raw material distribution are equally distinguishable. The technological issue of low-fired conditions has been specifically investigated to meet the question of in-household construction of the pithoi. The overall assessment of the physicochemical results contributes to speculations about the jar builders constituting a different artisan group from ordinary potters. Ethnohistorical data of itinerant craftsmen from other Greek regions are also considered as a useful point of reference."
