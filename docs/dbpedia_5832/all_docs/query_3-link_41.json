        "text": "This is a question that confounds and deeply frustrates me. If we’re going to live together and thrive and appreciate each other, we certainly can’t do it living in silos.\n\nI’d like to share a few examples from people who I think are well-intentioned:\n\nYaniv is a Jewish doctor (every mom’s dream!). Growing up in a secular Persian and Moroccan family, he’s now partnered with an openly gay Ashkenazi Orthodox man- already showing he’s pretty open-minded. I was telling him about my trip up north last week, where I visited many Arab villages, including some Christian communities. He actually lived for several years in Haifa as well so he has spent time in this part of the country. I started talking about the different groups in Israel- Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Maronites, etc. And I noticed he didn’t really react. I asked him if he had learned about Christianity in school. He and his partner basically explained that in their schools, they learned only very basic information and didn’t get any exposure to the different types of Christianity. In the country where the religion was born! They were surprised, for instance, to learn that in the U.S. there are hundreds of different types of Protestantism alone.\n\nAhmed is an Arab Muslim cab driver. We were talking about our backgrounds and he asked about my origins. I explained that I’m Ashkenazi from Romania, Austria, Lithuania, Russia, and Belarus. He asked why my family came to America. I explained that in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, there were massive pogroms in Eastern Europe along with crushing poverty that motivated Jews to move to America. Ahmed asked me: “They killed Jews in Russia too? I thought they just did that in Germany during the Holocaust.” I was shocked, although I had heard similar things from European Christians in whose countries anti-Semitic violence took place, which is all the more problematic. There is 2,000 years worth of anti-Semitic massacres and discrimination which you can read about a bit here. Ahmed was sorry to hear about the anti-Semitic killings and genuinely surprised.\n\nYoav is a 26 year old Jewish guy from a moshav near Jerusalem. An open-minded guy, he told me about how he thought it was important for Jews to get to know Arabs and vice-versa. I told him how I visit all parts of the country, including nearby Bnei Brak, a Haredi city you can read about here and here. He said he’s never been there (he lives 20 minutes away) and was considering a trip sometime, but he’d need time to think about whether he was up for it. As an aside, I met an 18 year old from Ramat Gan, a 5 minute walk from Bnei Brak, who had never even stepped foot there, even to buy a bottle of water. Yoav said he had seen on the news that someone paraded around Bnei Brak with an Israeli flag and got negative reactions from people, so he was afraid to go (a number of Haredim are not Zionist for religious reasons). I told him that first of all, I’ve been a number of times and never had any issues- in fact, I found a lot of interesting food, music, and people. I also told him that if your first interaction with someone is to delve into several-hundred-year-old political debates, you’re not going to have a very good discussion. Rather than getting your information about your neighbors from the news, I said, just go and meet people for yourself. He nodded in agreement.\n\nYair is a 20-something man from Jerusalem. I believe he either is or was Modern Orthodox. I had told him I was Reform and he and his Haredi friend asked me a bunch of (sometimes provocative) questions about the movement. I do think that they were well-intentioned and curious but had not met many Reform people before. Again- their sources were the news. I did ask Yair: “What personal experiences have you had with Reform Judaism?” He said: “Oh well I went to a Reform synagogue in London once and it did nothing for me. Sorry, but Reform Judaism is kind of hollow.” I then said to him: “There are millions of Reform Jews in the world and over 1,000 synagogues. If I ate one bad schwarma in Jerusalem, would that be fair to say all Jerusalem food sucks?” He said I made a good point and listened as I explained a bit about my community.\n\nI could write a whole separate blog about ignorance I hear from tourists here (I met a Christian American tonight here for business who was absolutely shocked that Sunday is a day of work here and he wondered what Christians do here. My answer: “they adapt”. I had to spend a solid 15 minutes explaining how Jews in the U.S. adapt to a calendar that doesn’t reflect our holidays and traditions- he had no idea). But I’d like to focus on my neighbors for a moment.\n\nThe examples I gave above are of Israelis who I truly believe have good hearts and are open-minded people. These are not people who are hardcore bigots or full of hate (although those exist in every society). These are people who know almost nothing about their neighbors, but who I believe have some curiosity about them.\n\nI don’t have an easy answer to this problem. Unlike in the U.S. where people go to school together with kids of all different races and religions, here there are separate schools for each sector of society. Setting up a genuinely pluralistic multilingual public school system could take quite a bit of energy and time (although it’s perhaps an interesting outside-the-box idea to explore).\n\nIn the meantime, I do have a suggestion. We need to step outside our bubbles and find one way each week in which we reach out to someone new. Someone from a background we know little or nothing about- or are even afraid of. It could be as simple as asking your Orthodox co-worker how the holidays were and what her family did. Or asking the secular guy in your office what music he likes. It could be opening up Wikipedia and reading about Arab Christians in Israel. It could be watching this amazing dabke dance from Nazareth or asking your favorite Arab falafel guy to teach you a few words of Arabic.\n\nThe point is if we wait for the government or politicians or the media or NGO’s to do this work for us, it’ll be too late. If we’re really going to make Israeli society work, we need to get to know each other. You don’t need a program. You don’t need a tour guide. Gently step outside your bubble (knowing it’s still there when you need to reflect and regroup) and embrace the possibilities.\n\nNo law can make someone like you. That only comes from an opening of the heart.\n\nOk so I’m going to make you wait a bit to get to the title story, but we’ll get there soon 🙂 First, I want to tell you about Tarshiha.\n\nI decided to wander around the Arab village of Tarshiha alone. Having talked to several Jewish Sabras here afterwards, they were a bit surprised- and none of them had done it themselves. This seemed bizarre to me- Tarshiha, half of the mixed Jewish-Arab municipality of Ma’alot Tarshiha, felt much, much safer than at least half of my hometown of D.C. And it’s historic and beautiful:\n\nAs I like to do, I wandered around with pretty much no agenda other than exploring and meeting cool people. And speaking a ton of Arabic 🙂 As my new favorite self-made motto goes: “if you’re cool, I’m down”.\n\nAmong a bunch of historic homes I noticed a door that said “photography studio”. I talked to the man inside, a 30 year old man named Eli (short for Elias). He is indeed a photographer and he invited me into his studio and immediately made me Arab coffee (think shot-sized coffee and much, much stronger). Because that’s how things work here.\n\nSince I happen to do social media public relations for a living, he asked me some questions about Facebook. I sat down with him for about an hour and showed him tricks of the trade, because why the hell not? He’s a good guy. Plus his Fusha (Modern Standard Arabic, for writing) was a little rusty, so I helped him add a section on his page in Arabic. Otherwise, he had written his page information, geared towards Arab clientele (weddings, etc.)- in Hebrew! Somebody go write a PhD thesis about the American Jewish oleh helping an Arab-Israeli write in Arabic because he was publicizing his events to Arabs…in Hebrew. Unpack that for a lifetime! So much meaning here 🙂\n\nAs we sat and sipped our drinks, car after car of his relatives pulls by the door and everyone greets each other. A cousin is a famous journalist, an uncle is a (Arab Greek Orthodox Christian) Mizrachi singer who performs for the Iraqi and Kurdish Jews in the neighboring villages (again- PhD thesis material). I could go on and on, but this town is like a non-stop family reunion. I feel like it’s My Big Fat Greek Wedding but an entire village. And I love it.\n\nBefore making my way to another part of town, we exchange contact info. He shows me his newly renovated church around the corner with great pride (even though he identifies as “Secular Orthodox”- a hilarious phrase in a Jewish context). Then he did something extraordinary. This man knows I’m an oleh chadash and that I know very few people in Israel. He points his hand towards the door of the studio and says in Hebrew: “Tireh, bo matay sheba lecha. Zeh habayit shelcha.” Come whenever you want. This is your home. I came to Israel looking for family, I just didn’t expect it would be a Secular Greek Orthodox Arab man! But why the hell not? I can’t think of a more generous way to welcome me to Israel than what he said. And you better believe I’ll be back- especially for the weddings he photographs!\n\nI continued to wander about the village. Most people were welcoming- a few stared. I don’t think many Jews wander the residential neighborhoods of Tarshiha, so I might have looked like a bit of an oddity. But frankly, I’m proud of myself for trying something new and I met a lot of kind and welcoming people there. I find it absolutely embarrassing that not a small number of my fellow Jewish Israelis know more about South America, Germany, or India than about their own neighbors. It’s not only problematic for the future of this country, it’s also a great loss for the people who don’t visit. I literally stumbled upon an Ottoman mosque and administrative headquarters just when looking for a bathroom. It’s true that it can be scary or disorienting to get lost in an unfamiliar town, but if you can handle trekking in the Himalayas, you probably have the instincts to manage Tarshiha.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I caught sight of a door and house covered in flowers. It was gorgeous. Clearly someone had put great effort into making it pretty. There was a picture of a woman who had made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and then just tons of funky modern artwork and colors. As I stood staring, I heard a voice from inside: “tfaddal” – come on in!\n\nMeet Yasmin. Yasmin is a spunky, artistic Bedouin woman who lives in the village. As she’s literally doing her laundry in front of me, she brings me water and candies and invites me to sit. We chat and chat. She works at a factory with Jews and she frankly liked to speak Hebrew with me while I spoke Arabic with her. To her, the North is a great place because “Jews and Arabs are brothers”. She feels they work well together and have good relationships. Like most Israelis of all stripes, she is very very fond of her hometown. She has relatives in nearby Arab villages, but she doesn’t even like to visit there because home is where it’s at. We talk about her mom who made the Hajj pilgrimage. Yasmin was very proud, but Yasmin herself doesn’t want to do it. She believes in God but not all the rituals and prayers- like not a small number of Jews.\n\nMaking my way down the hill to eat sushi with my kibbutznik friends who were hosting me (because yes, the Arab village has sushi), I couldn’t help but think how hospitable a country this is. Both Jews and Arabs go out of their way to make you feel at home- with absolutely no expectation of something in return other than kindness and gratitude. Very, very few Americans would invite a stranger into their home like Yasmin or Eli did- even generous Americans. There is just a much greater sense of trust here and it’s frankly refreshing. It even inspires me to be a more generous person.\n\nAcross the street from the sushi place, I saw a guy selling nargeelah (hookah). I popped into his store and good lord if this is not one of the hottest people I’ve ever met, then slap me silly and call me a potato. His muscles were bulging. His face was gorgeous. And he has the friendliest smile to match. “I’ll have what he’s having.”\n\nMurad is a 20-something Arab Greek Catholic man from a small village up north. He works in Tarshiha selling supplies for nargeelah at his own shop. As is the custom here, we talked all about life- where we’re from, our background, our hopes and dreams. Because in Israel, you don’t wait until five coffee dates to get to know each other. He told me about his girlfriend- he said he feels no pressure from his family to get married or have children. That they’re having a good time. And then it was my turn and I did something pretty brave and I came out to him. In Arabic. Alone. And…it was absolutely fine. I don’t want to minimize the challenges of homophobia in any community, but since I got a positive vibe from him, I had a good feeling about it. He was very curious- he asked me how I knew, etc. etc.- the same kinds of questions I get even from liberal Americans.\n\nWhen I explained that when people are attracted to the same sex, it’s totally natural and that you even find it in other species, he looked fascinated and frankly, just accepted it. No pushback, no antagonism, just kind of a “hmm never thought about it that way” look.\n\nWe exchanged contact info, gave a nice bro hug, and sent each other some pretty big smiles.\n\nUntil I did sushi that night, I had spent my entire day in Arabic other than a few Hebrew words sprinkled in. For all intents and purposes, I spent my day in the Arab world. And guess what? It was pretty cool. I met a Secular Greek Orthodox man, a Sunni Muslim Bedouin woman, and a (super hot) Arab Greek Catholic guy with eye-popping muscles. I saw funky murals and artwork alongside ancient architecture. I even got delicious herbal melon tea at a cute cafe.\n\nThis is Arab Israel. 20% of the country. If you haven’t visited an Arab village- do so. You don’t really know Israel if you haven’t. And if the extent of your visit is eating schwarma and going home- then you visited a restaurant, not a culture. Get off your tuchus, as we say in Yiddish, and try something new. Friends, food, and fun await you. Tfaddal- come on in 🙂\n\nToday I heard or spoke Hebrew, ancient Samaritan Hebrew, Yiddish, Russian, English, Arabic, and Ukrainian. Today I danced with Hasidim, watched a Russian man dance with life-sized puppets, and davvened in a messianic Chabad shul.\n\nHere’s how it went down.\n\nI wanted to get out of the house and explore. Missing the fun of trekking up north, I decided to explore Gush Dan, or Central Israel (near Tel Aviv). I went to the decidedly not-so-touristy Holon and Bat Yam, both a short bus ride away.\n\nI had no plans and really no idea what to expect.\n\nI got off the bus in Holon and noticed a sign pointing to the “Shomronim” neighborhood. That’s the Hebrew word for “Samaritans“. Maybe you learned about the “Good Samaritan” in your Bible class. Yes, that’s them. They claim descent from the tribes of Ephraim and Menashe, who are in turn tied to Samaria (Hebrew: Shomron). Hence their name.\n\nI immediately asked around and found my way to their neighborhood. To give you an idea of how unique this is- there are 800 Samaritans in the entire world. They are keepers of pre-rabbinic Judaism and they use an ancient form of Hebrew, including an alphabet much closer to the original since rabbinic Judaism adapted an alphabet based on Aramaic.\n\nHere are some examples from today:\n\nBecause this is how I roll, after knocking on four or five doors (all of which had Samaritan Hebrew on them!), I got referred to Benny Tsedaka, a leader in the community. He was sleeping, but his brother told me to walk in and wake him up. So, to the horror of my friends in America, I walked into a total stranger’s home and basically kept talking and knocking on the door till the old man woke up.\n\nHe invited me in and gave me quite the lecture about the history of the Samaritans and their “original Judaism” (a phrase, incidentally, told to me several times by Haredim, but this guy might have them beat). He, along with the other older men on the street, wore a white robe. He showed me their prayer books, still written in the Samaritan script that I recognize from ancient Jewish tablets. I almost asked him who their rabbi was, but caught myself 😉 It was like peering into the past, even as he told me to grab my smartphone and take pictures.\n\nHe chanted Torah for me using the Samaritan pronunciation and their trop, or cantillation system. And he did it from memory. Incidentally he chose the first day of Bereishit, or Genesis- the parashah I used to chant at synagogue on Rosh Hashanah. The reason he could do it from memory is that unlike rabbinic Jews, like myself, they don’t read Torah in synagogue. Instead, people pair off and go read in people’s homes- both men and women. That way, he said, everyone learns to read. A nice idea indeed.\n\nHe is very proud of his tradition and he has every right to- his community has survived conquest after conquest for thousands of years. Before there were Christians or Muslims or Arabs or Byzantines or Persians here, Samaritans were here- and they managed to survive. Or perhaps better put, since we are all Israelites, we managed to survive. When I told him I was an oleh chadash- a newly minted Israeli- he made a point of saying “welcome home”. A long delayed reunion, indeed.\n\nHe’s not a fan of Haredi Judaism because he feels it’s not traditional or authentic enough. That it’s a product of Eastern Europe and interactions with Christians, unlike his authentic Judaism from here. He also said he likes that in his community, women read Torah too and that if God didn’t want women to be front and center, why did Miriam sing as we crossed the sea? An interesting point. I won’t delve into the debate about what Judaism is best other than to say I think there’s something beautiful in all varieties. I will say, though, that someone who wants to argue about what the most “original” form of Judaism is is going to have a tough time beating someone who prays in paleo-Hebrew script.\n\nStill digesting my interaction with ancient Judaism, I hopped on a bus to Bat Yam to see the sunset. I liked learning about Samaritan Judaism, but sometimes the conversation veered into (very) right-wing politics and religious debates that are less interesting to me. Benny could certainly make Bibi (or a rabbi) blush.\n\nAs I made my way to the sea, I saw this ridiculous man dancing around with busty life-sized female puppets (and later, Jewish puppets with peyos!). To disco music, to Russian music, to Mizrachi music, and even to Yiddish classics! I can’t tell you how much this made me laugh and smile. What a nice way to unwind after the meaningful but at times overwhelming experience I had in Holon. Apparently his grandfather grew up with similar shows in the Soviet Union in the 50’s. I was thoroughly entertained. I gave him a nice tip and we exchanged words and smiles in Hebrew and a bisl Yiddish. These are the people who make the world go round.\n\nAfter some delicious kebabs, I grabbed a bus home. Except that on the way, I heard Hasidic music blasting. I hopped off the bus and ran and joined in dancing with a bunch of men in a circle. Speakers blasted Hasidic hits (some of which I knew and are on my phone) as we oy yoy yoy’ed and danced. Just when it couldn’t get any cooler, they started blasting Mizrachi music, including songs entirely in Arabic. I swerved my queer Jewish hips and my hands suavely bounced around. I felt a little out of place (I think some of the men just didn’t know what to think of me- it’s not every day someone like me is at a Hasidic street party in Bat Yam), but in the end, it’s my God too so I rolled with it. And although I wish that the women and men could dance together, I had some fun.\n\nBased on the signange, I knew it was Chabad that put on the event for Sukkot, the holiday currently being celebrated. Chabad is a Hasidic group focused on kiruv, or outreach to other Judaism. As Judaism is not evangelical, they only reach out to other Jews. I don’t identify as Chabad, but I do appreciate some of the work they do. Anywhere you go in the world, Chabad is there to give you a kosher meal, a place to pray, a place to do Jewish. In my neighborhood, I frequently stop by to buy supplies for various Jewish holidays. The best part about Chabad is whether it’s your style of Judaism or not, they’re always there. And that is a mitzvah.\n\nNow as my sweaty body prepared to hop back on the bus, a cute young Chabadnik asked me if I had davvened arvit (evening prayers). I hadn’t (because that’s not usually how I approach Judaism), but I told him I’d join their minyan. Jews are supposed to pray in groups of 10 (men only for Orthodox- men or women for progressive Jews). I haven’t generally found the Orthodox prayer style meaningful for me (it feels too fast for what I’m used to), but I think it’s a mitzvah to help these people out so I joined in.\n\nWe went downstairs into a shtiebel (small synagogue) and prayed. The cute guy helped me keep up with the pages (they move really fast!) and before you knew it, we were done. By the way, when I say cute, he’s not a cute kid- he’s a cute adult. He’s a “your kippah is super sexy I’d like to daven maariv and make a mitzvah” adult.\n\nI digress. As I’m leaving, another hot young Chabadnik starts talking with me. He’s from Ukraine and the woman sitting next to us is half Georgian half Ukrainian. They are both olim like me- new Israelis. I’m starting to think I might want to learn Russian for an even richer Israeli experience. I notice a sign in the synagogue about the former leader of Chabad, Rabbi Schneerson being the moshiach (messiah). Not the typical generic “moshiach” signs, but much more direct and specific. There are some Chabadniks who think he was just a great leader and others that veer into messianism, thinking this particular rabbi will come back as the moshiach. Playing dumb, I ask the Ukrainian guy if the sign meant that the rebbe was the moshiach and he said yes. I am far, far, far from an expert on Chabad, but I’m pretty sure I just prayed in a synagogue of the more messianic stream of the movement.\n\nAs I headed back to Tel Aviv, I couldn’t help but think what a messy, meaningful, and deeply satisfying day I had had. I had been lectured about my progressive politics and rabbinic Judaism by a man who speaks ancient Hebrew. I had felt kind of out of place as a Hasidic dance party as a queer person and a Reform Jew. And I ended up praying with (maybe?) messianic Chabadniks when I absolutely never would have prayed with them if that’s what their synagogue was about.\n\nAnd on the same day, I met an ancient relative of mine. I saw ancient Hebrew script written on doors and flyers. I danced to Hasidic music – for free – in public. I saw a Russian guy dance around with ginormous puppets to Yiddish and Slavic dance music. In short, I experienced thousands of years of history in the course of minutes. I lived it up.\n\nSukkot is, in English, called the “Feast of Booths”. It’s one of the few holidays that doesn’t commemorate an event. Rather, by setting up sukkot, temporary structures, we remind ourselves of the fragility of life and of our wandering in the desert for 40 long years. Wandering in search of a home, a more permanent structure than the ragtag hut of a sukkah.\n\nThis Sukkot, I’ve found my home. A home where yes, things are sometimes complicated and messy and take a while to untangle. And also a home filled with more meaning per square foot than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nSome Israelis ask me if Americans make more money. “You’re crazy!” some say, “you’d make so much more money there and have a bigger house!”. So the f*ck what? You can give me the biggest mansion on the highest hill with the best view, and I’m not interested one bit. Because there’s no way in hell I’m going to spend Sukkot there with a Samaritan, a Russian puppet dancer, and Hasidim.\n\nAmerica has better air conditioning and cleaner toilets. But I don’t really care. I’ll be too busy out and about exploring thousands of years of history, dancing and laughing along the way.\n\nI just got back from an amazing trip up north. The North is the most beautiful part of an already stunning country. It is also the area with the most non-Jews.\n\nWhen some foreigners think of Israeli non-Jews, perhaps they picture an old Bedouin man with a kufiyyeh sitting in the desert. While that certainly exists, that hardly scratches the surface of non-Jewish diversity here in Israel. For my previous post about Jewish diversity here, click here.\n\nIn one trip spanning less than a week, I personally met and spoke in Arabic with non-nomadic Bedouins, Greek Catholics, Maronites, Druze, Greek Orthodox, Copts (ok, they were tourists from Georgia, but still!), and Sunni Muslims. I’ve even met self-identified “secular Druze” and “secular (Greek) Orthodox”. The latter sounds hilarious in Hebrew because “Ortodoksi Hiloni” sounds like an Orthodox Jew who is secular. I’m sure someone out there identifies that way, but man it sounds funny in Hebrew 🙂\n\nIn Yafo, for instance, on a brief walk around town, I even noticed the Church of Scotland (presumably Presbyterians). In Jerusalem, I sat and talked with Armenians in a mixture of Hebrew and, believe it or not, Armenian-accented Arabic. And both men were not big fans of their own church!\n\nI haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of Haifa, where there is the Bahai world headquarters as well as the center of Ahmadi Muslims, a small sect persecuted in many predominantly Muslim countries. This sect has the unique distinction of having translated the Quran into Yiddish in 1987. I’m sheppin naches that these people like the mamaloshn!\n\nAnd we haven’t even begun to talk about lifestyles, language, or politics. In Haifa, there’s an entire young Arab hipster culture. There are also three different Arab parties in the Knesset (now under one umbrella): one Jewish-Arab communist party, one Arab nationalist party, and one Islamist party. Just to be clear, if these parties were running against each other in any other Middle Eastern country, they’d be considered intense political and ideological rivals. Regardless of your views on the parties, the fact that they now comprise a single unit in Israel is quite unique and shouldn’t mislead you into thinking there’s uniform thinking in this sector. Oh also, 24% of Arab Muslims vote for explicitly Zionist parties.\n\nSometimes in the West people are tempted to view Middle Easterners, Jewish or Arab, as “stuck in the past”. That if we’re keeping age-old traditions, we must be divorced from the modern world. Rather, I’d like to posit that we live in a world where the beautiful heritage that brought us to this day is kept alive precisely by integrating it with the tools of the modern world. That’s why the pictures below, all of which were taken in centuries-old (sometimes millenia-old) Arab communities, shouldn’t surprise you. Because you can hold onto tradition and adapt. My Arab friends aren’t caricatures. If you really want to embrace all Israelis, including non-Jews, let go of the exoticism and realize that this is also the face of Arab Israel:\n\nIn the end, the best thing you can take from visiting non-Jewish communities here (not all non-Jews are Arabic speakers, but we’ll save that for another blog) is that if you try to speak about them as a whole, you’ve already missed the point. These are extremely diverse communities- religiously, ideologically, and even linguistically (every village and even religious community can have its own dialect).\n\nMy best advice? Pick up an Arabic textbook, find a good teacher (yes I do tutor 😛 ), and get to know your neighbors. Move beyond the transactional nature of your favorite Arab hummus joint or falafel stand. If your only source of information about Arab-Israelis is the newspaper, you’ve got a lot to learn. And so do I, which is why I intend to continue visiting these communities and making friends.\n\nIn the end, the only way to really experience another culture is with your own two eyes, your feet planted firmly on the ground, and your mind open as wide as the sky above the Galilee.\n\nThis story has a very happy ending, so read till the end.\n\nUntil 8pm today, my day sucked. I went to the dreaded Israeli post office to pick up packages, saw a man screaming at a postal worker so loud he had to be escorted out, got swindled by a cab driver who tried to make me pay 50 shekels cash in addition to my fare, was shown three illegal apartments, and had to listen to a real estate agent bash Orthodox people (I told him I was religious too and I love all communities). Then, I went to a baklava place where, when I asked the guy behind the counter how he was doing, he said “I don’t like to talk to people, tell me what you want. This is business, leave me alone.”\n\nSo like I said, that really sucked.\n\nFeeling despondent, I headed to the beach in Yafo. First off, I love nature. Also, I love Yafo. And third, I know that no matter how shitty things get here, someone or something always help turn them around.\n\nThat’s exactly what happened, in the most unexpected way.\n\nFirst, I bought tea from an old Bedouin guy sitting on a bench. Bedouin tea is made with sage and it is delicious. He invited me to sit and we chatted in Arabic as he went in and out of slumber. Ibrahim, probably in his 70s, can’t be in the best shape. After a nice chat (and helping him market his tea), I left him some extra money and continued homeward.\n\nOn the way back, I saw a middle aged man and his teenage son. I recognized them because they had been talking to the Bedouin man. The older man, Mounir, stalks talking to me in Arabic-accented Hebrew. I was unsure at first if he was Mizrachi or Arab, but then I asked if he spoke Arabic and suddenly his son Basil joined in.\n\nIf this were America, the conversation would’ve probably lasted a minute or two and then ended with a “have a good night”.\n\nBut this is not America, so it instead lasted two hours and ended with exchanging phone numbers.\n\nMounir and his son Basil, 16 years old, work together in shiputzim, “renovations”. I kept asking where they live and I couldn’t quite understand- something was said about Lod and something about Yafo. I just basically tossed aside the question and moved on.\n\nBasil is a cute kid. Every time a Tel Avivi girl would walk by, his eyes would open wide with excitement. He said he was tired of all the girls in hijabs at his school. He saw one beautiful woman walking with a man and I joked with him that I would talk to the guy for him. He laughed and said the guy would beat me up!\n\nI noticed something curious. The dad loved to talk in Hebrew and the kid would ask him to switch to Arabic. I asked Basil if he spoke Hebrew and he said no, not really. If this kid was indeed from Yafo, this is pretty out of the ordinary. Seeing as how more than half of Yafo is Jewish, even an Arab kid educated in an Arab-language school would probably have some command of Hebrew.\n\nThat’s because they’re not from Yafo. Perhaps sensing that after an hour or so of speaking to each other in Arabic about why I made aliyah, the attack in Vegas, the situation in America, and the beautiful women of Tel Aviv, I was trustworthy and kind, he told me they’re from Tul Karm. Mounir and Basil have Israeli-government work permits that allow them to leave the West Bank and come to Tel Aviv. Honestly, I was a bit in shock and for a moment, scared. I had of course met Israeli Arabs and even Palestinians from East Jerusalem and a guy from Hebron while visiting Yerushalayim. But never had I met a Palestinian right smack in the middle of Tel Aviv.\n\nAs we continued to talk, they told me how impressed they were that an American spoke Arabic and that the dad believes Jews are wise and built a beautiful city in Tel Aviv. I said thank you and that while some Jews are wise, I’ve met some who are less so and that there are good and bad (and semi-ripe) apples among all peoples. He agreed with a chuckle as my fear began to fade.\n\nAs the night drew to a close and they had to head home, I couldn’t help but think how this never- and I mean never- would have happened if I didn’t speak Arabic. While the father spoke (some) Hebrew, the kid spoke none (other than an interestingly placed “hevanti” instead of “fahman 3aleyk” when he wanted to say “I understood”). He didn’t speak much English either. If the peoples of this region are to ever live in peace, we’re going to have to learn each other’s languages. It’s a sign of respect and it’s the only way to truly understand each other and open hearts. What good are propaganda posters and demonstrations if in the end we can’t talk to each other?\n\nAs Basil and I exchanged WhatsApp information, Mounir put his hand on my shoulder and said, “inte mitla ibni” – you are like my son. I have no family in Israel and, as I wrote in a previous blog, the vast majority of my family in America is toxic. The only family I have here is the one I make. Who would’ve guessed that that would include Palestinian workers from Tul Karm?\n\nI don’t know if you believe in God, but sometimes I just see signs of the divine in my everyday life. I can’t think of something more spiritual and special than what Mounir told me. That’s God’s love.\n\nWalking alongside the sea, the tension of the day disappeared. My heart lifted towards the sky as I thought about the little miracle happened in the most mundane place in the holiest of lands. Between the crash of the waves, the sleeping Bedouin, and the lights of Tel Aviv.\n\nToday, my day started with terrorism and ending with me and some Mizrachim singing Umm Kulthum.\n\nI’m in the (very stressful) process of finding an apartment in Tel Aviv. I’ve never had such a difficult time finding a place to live in any other city. The loosely-regulated rental market here is super competitive with sketchy offers abounding. I’ll find something, it’s just exhausting.\n\nIn need of a break, I did something most Tel Avivim would not do when in need of relaxation, and went to Jerusalem.\n\nHaving gotten a bit turned around, instead of taking a bus from the Central Bus Station, I actually ended up taking a bus to Kfar Chabad and then a second bus to Jerusalem. I could detour here and tell you about the adventures of making a highly-improvised bathroom stop between bus rides, but I’ll save that for one-on-one conversations 😉 Israel constantly challenges your definitions of “gross”.\n\nI hopped on the second bus, which incidentally took us partially through the West Bank/Samaria.\n\nThis particular route was gorgeous. Unlike the main bus lines to Jerusalem, this was totally rural with no traffic whatsoever. The scenes were idyllic.\n\nI felt a bit nervous going through this area today as there was a terrorist attack this morning. Three young men – an Ethiopian Jew, one (I believe) Mizrachi Jew, and one Israeli-Arab – were ruthlessly murdered as they did their job providing security for the community of Har Hadar. Solomon, Yossef, and Or – may their memory be for a blessing. I’m praying for their families. And I was so sad this morning I was frankly at a loss for words- and I still am.\n\nI almost didn’t go to Jerusalem, but in the end- fuck terrorism. There’s only so much you can control in life and after taking reasonable precautions, I just want to live my life. Just like these young people would’ve liked to.\n\nIncidentally, we passed by a sign to Har Hadar on the way to Jerusalem. It’s that small of a country.\n\nI get to Jerusalem, a bit frazzled, and hop off the bus. To my right is a sign with bunch of Hasidic posters, one of which was in Yiddish. I approached two twenty-something Hasidim and asked in Yiddish for them to explain one of the signs. Turns out, there is a Yiddish-language theater production being broadcast out of Brooklyn into movie-style screens in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, which they invited me to.\n\nThe two young men were Belz Hasidim and for an hour and a half, we spoke in a mixture of Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. One, Dovid, was born in London and the other, Yankev, grew up in Montreal, another one of my favorite cities. Yankev was a bit shy, though we spoke a little French together since he learned some in Montreal (and so did I!). Dovid was a real shmoozer and a sweet guy. He told me all about yeshiva and how he lamented the lack of Kosher steak in Jerusalem. He made a point of telling me he doesn’t go to political demonstrations, which reminded me of how I often felt in America having to show I wasn’t one of “those” people in my minority group. We talked about our favorite Jewish texts. They love the halachos of Shabbes and I shared with them my favorite Jewish teaching – which, much to my surprise, they didn’t know. In fact, they asked me to translate it for them into Yiddish, which remarkably I did!\n\nBefore leaving, as some people are wont to do here, Dovid shared with me a little bit of prejudice. He told me, in light of today’s attack, that Arabs aren’t very bright. I of course challenged him on this and his response, while bigoted, was quintessentially Jewish and kind of funny: “The Arabs aren’t very good at terrorism. Jews don’t do terrorist attacks but if we did, we’d be better at it.” So basically, in a phrase that would make the alt-Right twist and squirm and vomit, he said that Jews would make better terrorists than Arabs. As the father in My Big Greek Wedding would say “the Greeks invented everything.” I couldn’t help but chuckle.\n\nI headed towards the Old City as two Arab women stopped me. They asked me in Arabic for directions (how cool is that??) – and surprisingly, thanks to my Arabic and the glory of modern transit apps, I helped them find their way! In fact, I was headed in the same direction.\n\nWe hopped on the train and I froze. I had walked with them 10 minutes speaking in Arabic but when I got on the train, I was scared to keep talking. I looked around, and thinking about today’s terrorist attack, I was worried how people might react. There are legitimate reasons I felt that way, as you can read about here.\n\nAs I got off the train, I walked towards the Old City. I saw an Arab man selling sunglasses. I approached him and I said I didn’t need any glasses, but I told him he was making me happy so I wanted to give him a gift and handed him some money. He invited me to sit with him. We spoke in Arabic (I felt more comfortable out in the open air instead of cramped public transit where, frankly, attacks are more likely so I can understand people’s fear). Turns out he’s from Hebron in the West Bank/Samaria. He comes to work in Jerusalem each day. He doesn’t know any English, so I taught him some English words to help with his marketing. The poor guy is 60, 70 years old with 10 kids and a two-hour commute each way. I can’t imagine what today’s terror attack is going to do to his livelihood as transit will slow and work permits may be frozen. I suppose the terrorist wasn’t thinking of his fellow Palestinians who need to make a living when he shot three people.\n\nThe man gave me a big smile and a warm handshake as I headed off to meet my friend Sarah, a Modern Orthodox/Traditional Jew from America. We ate Kosher pizza and then wandered through the Armenian Quarter, where I had never been. I love Armenians. When I was in high school, a friend gave me an Armenian CD which I still have on my computer. Armenians are so, so similar to Jews. They are a Diaspora community that survived a genocide and manages to preserve their language and religion. And they’re pretty cute!\n\nWe talked with several Armenian men about their visits to the homeland, their life in Jerusalem, the Armenian Church (they had strong opinions- and not positive ones!), and the Armenian-language schools down the street. I even got to hear their Armenian-accented Arabic! One man votes Meretz and his wife votes Likud. I went to an Armenian restaurant and got a fascinating dessert made out of crushed grapes and walnuts with a string inside. And, because this is how I roll, I got info on some Armenian tutors- because at some point, that would be fun.\n\nOn my bus back to Tel Aviv, I befriended a handsome American tourist named Nicolai. Non-Jewish and from Wisconsin, we talked the entire hour-long trip about Israel, Judaism, America, Bernie Sanders (we’re fans), and so much more. A truly open-minded fellow- which is not something to take for granted. Too many people arrive to Israel with preconceived notions of what it is and isn’t. He was pretty much an open book.\n\nHis phone didn’t have internet, so I walked him 20 minutes to his bus stop and got him on his way home. Because that’s what we do in Israel- we go out of our way to help others. I find the generosity that surrounds me here encourages me to be even kinder to people.\n\nI hopped in a monit sherut cab and headed home. What a day! Hasidim, Modern Orthodox, Arab-Israelis, Palestinians, tourists, Reform Jews (that’s me!). What else was missing?\n\nAs our Russian driver helped us wind through (largely) secular Tel Aviv, two Mizrachi guys up front started singing. Koby Peretz, Sarit Hadad, Shimon Buskila- you name it. Then, to their surprise, I made a request.\n\n“Inta omri,” I said.\n\nPleasantly surprised that an Ashkenazi would request an Egyptian classic, they started to sing. And to their delight- I joined in.\n\nOn a day when a deranged man tried to break the place I call home, I started the day with his hatred and I ended it by singing with Jews in Arabic.\n\nAnd in-between, I hung out with every sector of Israeli society.\n\nWant to write public policy papers about how to solve the Middle East conflict? Go for it- maybe they could help. Honestly, I don’t know.\n\nWhat I do know is I probably won’t have time for your conference. Because I’m going to be speaking Yiddish with Hasidim, training a Palestinian in marketing, and singing Mizrachi music in a cab. I’ll be getting to know my neighbors. Just like Solomon, Yossef, and Or would’ve wanted.\n\nI spent all day looking at (five) apartments and was exhausted! I treated myself to a stroll along the beach until I found myself in Yafo, my favorite place to get away.\n\nI grabbed a delicious melon ice cream, served in a frozen melon, and grabbed a seat outside. Nearby there was a young Arab kid named Muhammad. We struck up a conversation in a mix of Hebrew and Arabic and I asked if I could sit with him.\n\nMuhammad is a 25 year old tow-truck driver from Kfar Qasem, incidentally the village where my friend Sara is from from a previous story I shared on my blog. Much like my beloved Daliat Al Karmel and Yafo itself, certain towns seem to find their way into my heart over and over again. American Jews would call that bashert.\n\nHe’s a sweet kid- he speaks fluent Hebrew and Arabic…and Turkish! He’s gone on a half dozen trips to Turkey and is going for a month again this year. He was even recommending resorts and cities for me to visit there. He learned his Turkish from soap operas. It’s nice to know that both Jews and Arabs do that here (so many Jews here speak Spanish thanks to telenovelas).\n\nBecause this is Israel, things quickly got personal. Nice to know that intense sharing about deeply held opinions when you first meet someone isn’t just a Jewish trait here! Muhammad says that when he first talks to Jewish customers over the phone, they are so relieved that their car will get off the road and back to safety that they offer to make him tea and invite him over. Then, when he arrives to help them and they see his face, the conversation freezes and he feels they are afraid of him “cutting off their heads”.\n\nI told him I thought that was sad, and then his response was even sadder: “I’ve gotten used to it, it’s always been that way.” You know there’s some real toxicity to heal from here when a young man like this feels resigned to the mutual distrust that exists between so many Jews and Arabs here.\n\nAt this point he leans over to pull up something on Youtube.\n\nWhile he’s pulling up the video, his friend Mamdooh tells me about his family. His family arrived from Libya during a war with Italy and lives in Ramle. Yes, re-read that sentence about 10 times. His Muslim Arab family arrived to present-day Israel 100 yeras ago from Libya. I was baffled. I had heard some about Arab labor migrations from neighboring countries to Ottoman (and Mandatory) Palestine, but never had I heard of his family’s 6,000 person Libyan clan in Ramle. Apparently, his family and a neighboring family (keep in mind “family” means thousands of people) engaged in a several year blood feud resulting in 40+ deaths in the 1990s. He said a sheikh intervened to end it, but even to this day it’d be too difficult to try to marry the other family. I told him that sounded sad and he agreed with a gentle nod of the head.\n\nAs we munched on loads of malabi (which they of course gave me for free), Muhammad came back to show me the Youtube video. It was an Arabic-subtitled Hebrew video (kind of like an Arab MEMRI) of a Haredi classroom talking about the Temple Mount. Honestly, I couldn’t hear the video that well, but it was clear that racist things were being said about Arabs. I told him that that video sounded offensive and that it’s also important not to judge entire groups of people based on one video. I even had the chance to teach him about Reform Judaism. I reminded him that there are closed-minded and open-minded people in every community.\n\n“Like you” he said as I mouthed the words “open-minded”.\n\nMy heart swelled. I’ve had a lot of powerful moments here in Israel. Tonight may take the cake with this one comment. I saw that I had made a difference in this one man’s life and it made me feel hopeful- and proud.\n\nThe conversation turned back to fun things- because in Israel, life fluctuates rapidly between the bitter and the sweetest of the sweet. Muhammad showed me Youtube videos of techno dabke music from Nablus. In a sentence that would suffice for a linguistic anthropology thesis, he said: “shoof al-dabke min Shchem”. Look at the dabke from Shchem. Which is to say, in an Arabic-language sentence, he used the Hebrew word for a Palestinian city in the West Bank/Samaria.\n\nBefore I headed home at 2am, Muhammad invited me to visit him in Kfar Qasem and we exchanged numbers. He said he hangs out with his friends in Yafo pretty much every night- and told me to come back.\n\nSome of you might know I speak eight languages fluently. I speak a few more to varying degrees. Throughout my life, there have been people telling me what I should do with them. That I should work for the CIA or the FBI. That I should be a translator. That I should do this or that.\n\nGuess what? While you’re pondering what you think I should be doing with my life, I’m using my languages to enrich mine – and others’. What do I do with my languages? I do what I did tonight. I make friends, I explore the world, I learn from others, I change minds.\n\nWant to wring your hands about what I should do? I’ll be too busy to notice. I’ll be hanging out in downtown Yafo, as the lights go dim, eating malabi, and laughing with friends as the Arabic blends into Hebrew back into Arabic. And the sun rises on another life-changing day in the land I call home.\n\nI didn’t fully appreciate the diversity of Israeli Jews until I made aliyah. Yes, I had visited on trips, but you don’t get to know people with the same degree of depth. One of the things I love about American Jewry is the cultural cohesion and unity. And one of the things I love about Israeli Judaism is how incredibly diverse it is.\n\nLast week, I was in Jerusalem. My friend and I went to a Thai restaurant. We were joking around with the guy behind the counter. Turns out, he’s a half Kurdish half Moroccan Jew. We joked about him finding us a fourth person so we could all go on a double date. He said he’d be happy to take us to a Kurdish restaurant down the street and then taught me some Kurdish. Right, my Jewish Thai restaurant waiter offered to teach me the Kurdish his grandparents say around the dinner table. Chew on that one for a while.\n\nThis past weekend, I hung out with a bunch of vegan hippie Jews at a commune in Tel Aviv. As they munched on lentils and drank home-brewed Kombucha with shouts of “lechaim”, I met a half Norwegian half Persian Jewish filmmaker. Yes, both halves are Jewish. Apparently, her grandparents on either side only spoke their native language (Norwegian and Judeo-Persian), so they couldn’t communicate with each other! Luckily, this talented young woman speaks both Norwegian and Farsi and even spent two years living in Norway.\n\nToday I hung out in Bnei Brak. While I was buying some books and music, I befriended the two salesmen. One, who looked quite clearly Ashkenazi, was a Vizhnitzer Hasid and a Yiddish speaker. We had fun shmoozing a bisl in the mamaloshn. Turns out, he also understands Dutch- his mother’s family is from the Netherlands. Oh and his father was born in Switzerland, where his parents were working for the Jewish Agency. For people who know the politics of Hasidim and Zionism, take a moment to digest that one for a bit.\n\nThe other Hasid in the store looked more tan skinned, so I mistakenly assumed he was Mizrachi (there are Mizrachi Hasidim). Turns out, he’s just like me- an Ashkenazi Jew who kept his Middle Eastern complexion even in the Diaspora 😉 . Guess there isn’t just one “Ashkenazi look” after all. Now brace yourselves for a real kicker. His family made aliyah…from Mauritius. Right, so basically his family escaped the Nazis but the British refused to let them into Mandatory Palestine. So they sent them to a bunch of islands in the Indian Ocean. To this day, his family likes to tell stories of what it was like there.\n\nI could literally go on and on with examples- my friend who is half Serbian half Moroccan and works at a Kosher Georgian restaurant, my half Iraqi half Ashkenazi female rabbi, my half Italian half Ashkenazi friend married to a Cherokee Jew! The diversity here is endless. If your image of Israel is that everyone looks like Andy Samberg, you’re in for a major shock. And I’m saying this as someone who would very much like a country of Andy Sambergs- what a cute Jewish boy!!\n\nIsrael is an incredible fusion of hundreds of Jewish cultures from around the world, preserved for 2,000 years and reuniting and reconfiguring meaning. I definitely miss my American Yiddishkeit, a force that unites the 90% of American Jews who are Ashkenazi with a shared humor, cuisine, and dialect. The good part about Israel is that in the absence of a unifying Judaism, there is the freedom to mix and match. It’s truly a place where no one can say, as someone told me on a temple trip in 5th grade: “you don’t look Jewish.”\n\nTonight, Rosh Hashanah ended. As a Reform Jew, I observe one day of the holiday, which you can read about here. I had amazing meals with friends, went to services for a taste of home, was greeted everywhere with Shanah Tovah, and even ate sushi 😉\n\nThis evening, I decided to go Israeli dancing. Anyone who’s known me for a while knows that I love Israeli dancing- it’s one of the first things I did in Israel.\n\nI go to this marathon event (it goes till 6am!) and there are hundreds- I mean hundreds- of people. All ages, all attires (I even saw a bustier), and tons of enthusiasm. There’s even a guy I know from dancing in DC. Because, Jews 🙂 The music was booming- there was even a live band to accompany the music! They had a screen that showed a picture of each singer, the name of the song, and a running clock of how long the marathon had gone on! I recognized so many of the songs I danced to at home- it was fantastic.\n\nDuring couples dancing (which I tend to avoid unless I’m with a friend- some of the middle aged women can get frisky!), I stepped aside to rest. I saw this cute guy so I started talking to him. I wished him “chag sameach”, a happy holiday. He said “what holiday?” I said “oh are you not Jewish?” And turns out, he wasn’t. He was just working the event. In fact, he’s an Arab Muslim from Nazareth named Muhammad Abbas. Poor guy’s name is so, so close to the name of the leader of the Palestinian Authority that pretty much nobody, Arab or Jewish, really likes.\n\nHe’s a student at Tel Aviv University studying English literature. He only listens to American music and he loves dark, intense American novels. We talked in Hebrew and Arabic about American film and literature (I recommended he watch Office Space for a clever satirical movie), and he stepped outside to work.\n\nThen it hit me- I owed him an apology. Growing up as 2% of the American population, I was constantly barraged with “Merry Christmas” for a two month period every year. I don’t begrudge anyone saying Merry Christmas- I just don’t want it said to me because it’s not my holiday. I stepped outside and I apologized to him for assuming he was Jewish. He took it totally in stride and laughed it off. We also both knew that this year, the Muslim New Year falls on the same day, so I ended up being right in wishing him a Happy New Year 🙂 . In the end, I do feel like I owed him an apology because I made an assumption about him and it wasn’t the way I like to treat people (or be treated). Just goes to show that you can’t assume a cute Semitic-looking boy here is Jewish!\n\nAt this point, a man selling food in Hebrew with an Arab accent starts talking to me saying not to worry about my holiday faux pas. That we’re all people and it’s good to wish each other blessings. This man, Ramzi, is from the magical place called Daliat Al Karmel. This place entrances me. If you’ve followed my blog, you know that in the course of 2 months in Israel, I’ve been there twice. That it has a special magic- the people, the trees, the view- that I have seen in few places in the world. And this man, just for this event, happened to be selling Druze pita in Tel Aviv! He lives up North!\n\nWe switch over to Arabic (and back and forth to Hebrew and English) as we talk about life and his village. He invited me to come visit him. You ready for a real twist? He owns a Matah – an orchard. My Hebrew name, which I chose when making aliyah and is extremely unique, is also Matah מטע. He invited me to come up whenever I want and we’re going to hang out on his orchard.\n\nAs if my night couldn’t get any more fabulous or diverse, on my way home I see an Orthodox family by an ambulance. In America, you’d pretty much say a prayer for them in your head and move on- not wanting to invade their space. Since this is Israel, I did the exact opposite. I walked over and asked if I could help. One woman said she couldn’t ask because I was Jewish (Orthodox Jews believe that it is not permissible to make another Jew work on a holiday). The other woman, perhaps in an act of pragmatism, simply told me they needed a cab, so I ordered it. I’ve spent enough time in pluralistic Jewish circles to know that even if Orthodox Jews can’t ask me to do something on Rosh Hashanah, if I just do it, it’s acceptable.\n\nI ordered a cab but just in time, another one came by and they got in. Luckily it was nothing life-threatening, but it looked like their little girl had a wound on her head. I hope she’s feeling better.\n\nAs I walked away, I wished them a Shanah Tovah. I knew they were celebrating my holiday 🙂 . They shouted back with a smile “ktivah vechatimah tovah” – may God write you a good year in the Book of Life.\n\nOn my way home, I realized just what an amazing holiday I had had. In the course of one day, I went from Reform services to Israeli dancing to hanging out with a Muslim friend to talking with Druze and helping Orthodox Jews.\n\nThis is my country. Where every fiber of my being is filled with meaning. I couldn’t be prouder to start a new life and a new year in Israel. My diverse, caring, and wonder-filled home.\n\nShanah tovah from the place where miracles aren’t on 34th street- they’re on every corner.\n\nToday, I went to a settlement. Ariel is a beautiful city of 20,000 a little over an hour by bus from Tel Aviv. It’s located beyond the Green Line in Samaria (Hebrew: Shomron). This area is called Shomron because that’s the name of the ancient Jewish capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel that was in this vicinity. To most Israelis, this is Israel (larger settlements like this tend to be part of the national consensus). To international organizations, this area is often known as the West Bank. And to most Palestinians, it’s part of Palestine.\n\nThis is not a typical tourist spot for Reform Jews or part of the Gay Pride Circuit, so I had never been here before (as a queer Reform Jew). I’m a curious guy and open to new things, so I hopped on a bus.\n\nThe most interesting thing about Ariel is that it’s not interesting. I don’t say that to be mean- there are actually some attractions in the area like stalactite caves and an archeological site of a 3,000 year old Jewish city. Unfortunately, because this is a small town, none of that was open or easy to get to.\n\nWhat I mean is that it’s very normal. I think the image me (and many progressive Jews and non-Jews) have in our mind of a settlement is an Orthodox family of 16 living in a trailer on a hilltop beating up Arabs. Just to be clear- there’s nothing wrong with an Orthodox family of 16, it’s just that I think many people think about settlements as a caricature, not realizing their diversity.\n\nAriel is possibly the most (Jewishly) integrated city I’ve been in in Israel. There are loads of secular people, there are Russians, there are Ashkenazim, there are Mizrachim (blasting some cool Mizrachi music I stopped and listened to). There’s a Kosher Mexican restaurant and a non-Kosher restaurant with Thai food. There are men in yarmulkes and women in tattered jeans with purple hair. There are judo lessons and piano concerts and even a mall. There are Palestinian workers and there are Arab-Israeli students at the local university.\n\nIt’s also beautiful:\n\nThe truth is, in a lot of ways, Ariel is like any other city. I think it’d behoove people of all backgrounds, particularly from the progressive world I come from, to understand there are many reasons people might live in a settlement. For some people, it’s just about affordability. Other people might like the view. And for some people, it’s a religious statement. For religious Jews, this is the land God promised us. And the West Bank/Shomron was an integral part of Jewish history for thousands of years and is still home to many sacred sites. I’m not interested in the politics, I just want people to understand that if you can’t put yourself in the shoes of a religious Jew who wants to live in the land of their ancestors, you’re not going to do a great job of figuring out how we can all live together. Empathy is about understanding where other people come from even if you disagree. People are complex and come in all shades of good and bad- including settlers.\n\nAs I prepared to catch my bus back to Tel Aviv (the West Bank is really, really close- you can see Tel Aviv from Ariel), I started to well up. I wasn’t sure why at first, but I figured it out. I snuck over to some bushes and just started balling. As much as I liked exploring Ariel today, I just couldn’t help but think about the Palestinian villages I could see on the hilltops. What was life like there? First-hand- I don’t really know. If we were elsewhere in Israel, I could just hop on a bus and go find out. But reality here is a bit starker. Due to the complicated situation (on both sides), I can’t just hop on a bus and visit a Palestinian village. I’m not even sure if/where it’s legal to do so. Or safe. The situation made me so sad and the tears came down. I hate seeing the world broken.\n\nI told myself that whenever I’m feeling despondent here, something magical happens to lift my spirits. And I was right. As I was waiting for the bus, I saw a familiar face. Sarah is a Muslim Arab-Israeli I met through a Hebrew-Arabic practice group in Tel Aviv. What are the odds that my first time visiting a settlement I bump into an Arab friend when I’ve only been here for two months? There are coincidences and then there’s bashert.\n\nWe hopped on the bus and I asked if I could sit next to her (important detail). We got to talking about Arabic dialects in Israel (I’m trying to figure out which ones to study- I already speak Syrian which is intelligible but want to get more local too). We spoke in a mixture of Hebrew and Arabic. She told me about her work at Ariel University (that’s right- she works at a college in a settlement) and her work with promoting Hebrew language studies for Arabs in her town of Kafr Qasim.\n\nThen we pulled up to a checkpoint. I’m glad there’s security to make sure everyone is safe. That being said, something fishy happened. Two guards came on board and walked around, but the only person they asked for ID from was the Muslim Arab woman in a hijab next to me- my friend Sarah. There wasn’t even the illusion of not profiling her. Then they looked at me sitting next to her: “Are you with her?” My answer (as I sat there fairly scared shitless): “We’re friends”. At that point, the guards requested my ID. After some skeptical glances, they gave us our IDs back and left the bus.\n\nI asked Sarah if they always asked her for her ID. She said yes. She also said that if I hadn’t been sitting next to her, they wouldn’t have asked for mine either. I said that I knew. It was kind of a scary experience for me, and I’m sure it’s upsetting for Sarah too even if she has resigned herself to it. Sarah is a full Israeli citizen born and raised. I’m not sure why a terrorist would be dumb enough to put on a hijab, but I’ll take at face value that anyone could be a threat and the guards have a stressful job. That being said, check everyone’s ID, keep people safer, and stop being racist. It’s a win-win.\n\nI have to say I’m proud of myself. When I was asked if I was with Sarah, the easy way out would’ve been to say that I don’t know her or barely know her. But the words that came out of my mouth, under pressure, were “we’re friends”. If that makes me an Arab by association, so be it. I’m a human being and damn proud of it.\n\nSarah got off the bus and I headed back to Tel Aviv. I couldn’t help but thinking about what an overwhelming day I had. Full of meaning and also a lot to process. How I try to find humanity in every community- settlers, Arab-Israelis, Palestinians- everyone. And how that can be really hard.\n\nIsrael is a verb. It means “wrestles with God”. It would’ve been easier for me to sit static on the beach today (and frankly I might need that after this trip). But instead, I moved, I wrestled. I went by myself to a place where most people I know have never stepped foot. It was interesting, it was hard, it was brave. I’m proud of myself.\n\nAs I got off the bus, I thanked the driver in Hebrew, assuming he was Jewish. He responded back “ma3 asalaameh” – that’s Arabic for goodbye. He winked at me and I smiled back. Guardian angels come in all shapes and sizes 🙂 ."
