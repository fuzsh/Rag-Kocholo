Following the destruction, comprehensive restoration of the stream was required. The restoration allows all Israelis to fully enjoy and experience the stream. of visiting tourist centers throughout the country. We will prioritize projects that will bring value and a significant contribution to large areas and those that will be carried out quickly and efficiently. Our guiding principle is development in places with touristic values based on the culture, religion and history of Land of Israelâ. participation rate required from the authority will be determined according to its financial strength. That is, the more established the authority, the less the office funding will be. Alongside this, in projects that involve an entrance fee, the participation rate of the office will be lower than those that are open to the public for free. Minister of Tourism, Haim Katz: âWe continue to develop infrastructures that will improve the experience\n\ninfrastructures that improve transportation accessibility to tourist sites, economic development that expresses the interest of several authorities, accessibility for people with disabilities, development of overnight products and infrastructure supporting hotels.

This scenic natural spring - known for its human-planted forests, oak groves and tranquil streams - suffered damage to infrastructure and amenities in 2020 due to flooding.
