        "text": "In 1921, South African Jew Isaac Ochberg led a daring rescue operation in Eastern Europe. Thanks to his courage and determination, combined with the unconditional support of the Jews of South Africa, 200 Jewish orphans were able to start their lives again in that country. This is your story.\n\nIsaac Ochberg was born in May 1879 in Ukraine and, aged just over 15, emigrated to South Africa with his father. He soon became rich from the timber trade, and became one of the most successful businessmen in the country. A generous philanthropist and dedicated community leader, he was actively involved in Jewish community organizations in Cape Town, where he lived. He was an ardent Zionist all his life and thus represented South Africa at the 16th World Zionist Conference in Zurich. He was also one of the founders of the Cape Town Jewish Orphanage, which he presided over for many years.\n\nIn South Africa, there was a large number of Jews from the Russian Empire, who, like the Ochbergs, had settled there at the end of the 19th century, after the resurgence, in Tsarist Russia, of persecutions and pogroms. You litvaks, as they were called, followed with concern the devastating news coming from their father's house, deir huh, in the old country. At the beginning of the 1920s, the scenario could not be darker. The First World War had left a trail of destruction and death. Hundreds of thousands of Jews trying to escape the intense fighting had abandoned their shtetls and their homes, and lived in absolute poverty, ravaged by hunger and disease.\n\nThe situation had worsened even further after the overthrow of the tsarist regime and the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. At the beginning of 1918, after the new Russian government had signed a separate peace with Germany, a bloody war broke out in the former Tsarist Empire. civil. They faced, on the one hand, the White Army, supported by liberal sectors and commanded by soldiers linked to tsarism, and, on the other, the Red Army of the Bolsheviks, organized by Trotsky to fight for the new socialist order. In 1921, the civil war came to an end with the victory of the Reds and the installation of the Soviet State. The toll in human lives was extremely high: 9 million deaths; and the famine that had taken over Russia in 1921 had been responsible for the deaths of millions of people.\n\nIn Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and Lithuania, regions with a high Jewish population and unlimited poverty, Jews suffered intensely. The terrible conditions in which the Jews lived had worsened even further, and anti-Semitism resurfaced with redoubled intensity. The civil war had left the Jewish population at the complete mercy of armed gangs that terrorized the streets. Pogroms were daily and Jews were massacred by Ukrainians and Poles, White and Red Russians, wherever they were. To this day, there are no exact numbers on how many died from such attacks.\n\nNews of death and devastation in the pogrom region, as well as terrible stories of abandoned orphans dying of disease and starvation, had spread throughout the Diaspora. The Chief Rabbi of the British Empire declared on one occasion: “...One million human beings were exterminated in just three years. In Ukraine, 3 million people were subjected to the horrors of hell.” […]. “There are about 600.000 homeless children, 150.000 orphans and 35.000 fatherless and motherless children in Ukraine who could die from cold, hunger and disease unless Jewish hearts still have a shred of humanity and come to rescue them.”\n\nIn South Africa, the litvaks they received desperate letters, smuggled across enemy lines, from family and friends begging for help. Raising funds for welfare for Jewish refugees became a major focus of South African Jewry during the First World War. The fate of Jewish war orphans especially mobilized the Jewish community and fundraising campaigns were carried out to subsidize them in Eastern Europe and assist their emigration to what was then Palestine.\n\nThe South African War Victims Relief Fund created during World War I was already working intensely when the idea came up to “try to organize a rescue operation to get at least some children out of hell and bring them to South Africa”. Isaac Ochberg immediately embraced the cause.\n\nDuring an extraordinary assembly in August 1920, Ochberg proposed that the Cape Town Jewish Orphanage “should take full responsibility for taking the children out of Europe and caring for them.” Furthermore, it should act as a center in charge of distributing them among charitable people who adopt them. “I suggest, furthermore, that a sum of £10.000 be raised by the Relief Fund for this purpose. This amount would be enough for the emigration of 200 children,” he said. A Fund for Orphans of the Pogroms to finance the cost of such an operation.\n\nHaving made the decision to carry out the rescue operation, Ochberg obtained authorization from the South African government for the minors to come, but they imposed certain conditions. Among the requirements, it was determined that only minors up to 16 years of age who did not have illnesses would be accepted, and the Jewish community would assume full responsibility for them. To conclude, he stipulated that the number of orphans to be received should not exceed 200. Ochberg also began contacts with the Federation of Ukrainian Jews, in London. The organization responds that it is prepared to help bring all the children that could be saved to London.\n\nShortly after the meeting where it was decided to move forward with the project, a fundraising event was held at a cinema in Cape Town. Soon the Jews present reached the initially stipulated sum of £10.000 and a new target of £25.000 was multiplied several times. Rushing to Johannesburg, Ochberg gains not only the support of the South African Jewish Orphanage, but of the entire community, extending his fundraising campaign to all districts of the country. And, surprisingly, they received support from various parts of larger society, not just the Jewish community.\n\nThe next step was to send someone to Europe to carry out the processing there. This was a delicate task, as people would have to go directly to the region of pogroms. Isaac Ochberg offers to carry out the task. He writes in his diary: “My journey is, without a doubt, full of difficulties, but I hope that with the help of the Almighty, I can overcome everything that comes my way.” At a meeting at the Cape Town Orphanage in March 1921, Joseph Kadish told his companions: “This is the last meeting that our President presides over before he leaves to pick up the children in Russia. He will face tribulations and dangers on this mission, but I hope he overcomes all difficulties and returns safely to Cape Town, in the company of the boys and girls.”\n\nThus, in March 1921, armed with documents guaranteeing him freedom of movement, Ochberg left for Eastern Europe, via London. Originally from Ukraine, he mastered the language and knew the region. The London headquarters of the Federation of Ukrainian Jews Abroad went to great lengths to help him, but with the Civil War devastating large areas of Poland and the surrounding area, and with very little functioning transport, there were definite limits to what could be achieved.\n\nUpon arriving in Eastern Europe, Ochberg traveled from city to city – Minsk, Pinsk, Stanislav, Lodz, Lemberg and Wlodowa – as well as small towns. Before his eyes were scenes of indescribable misery, suffering and violence. The most painful thing, however, was having to select among so many orphans the children he would take to South Africa. He decided to take eight from each of the institutions he passed through. To ensure the well-being of children throughout the journey, 'Daddy Ochberg', as the children began to call him, added new members to the group, including Alexander Bobrow, who would be a key element in the rescue operation.\n\nAlter, as he was called, worked as a chemical analyst in a sugar factory until the day when, upon seeing the devastation caused by the First World War, he left his job and began helping the Jews of Pinsk wherever he could. Alter belonged to the left-wing Poalei Zion party and, at his initiative and insistence, his comrades abandoned their jobs to help Jewish refugees. His biggest task was to go from village to village, literally collecting children, one by one, from the rubble that was left of their homes. Many had witnessed their parents and, in some cases, entire families being shot, before their frightened little eyes.\n\nIn a statement recorded before his death, Alter Bobrow says: “We found so many children that we were soon forced to set up orphanages. At first, Pinsk was isolated by the fighting and we were left practically to our resources. After some time, supplies began to arrive, first through the Jewish Benevolent Society in Berlin and later from the Joint Distribution Committee. One of the Americans who worked on this welfare committee, later became famous”, recalls Bobrow, “was Henry Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin Roosevelt”.\n\nHe also spoke about the strong typhus epidemic, the bombs that fell in the region and the pogroms, almost daily, organized by Ukrainian gangs. “To calm the children, a woman who helped us made them repeat 'The Almighty will protect and save us'”.\n\nThe trip\n\nAfter selecting the children, Ochberg made all the arrangements to take them to London, where the ship would leave for South Africa.\n\nUpon arriving in England, after a long and difficult journey, Ochberg wrote to Adolph Schauder, his friend who was a community leader in Port Elizabeth: “(...) You will be pleased to know that I returned to London last night, after passing through difficult trials during the last three months of my mission to the areas of pogroms. I was in almost all the villages of Ukraine Polish and Galicia and now I know the places where there is immeasurable suffering. I was able to gather the stipulated number of children and can safely say that the generosity demonstrated by South African Judaism by making it possible to remove them means nothing less than saving your life. They would certainly have died of inonation or illness, or if they would have lost to our people for other reasons. I am now in London with the purpose of getting transportation, and I hope to be able to inform by telegraph soon the data of our departure to South Africa, with the children. ”\n\nIn early September 1921, on board the ship Edinburgh Castle, Ochberg and the children left London for South Africa. Upon arriving at their new home, the children were warmly welcomed and taken to two orphanages maintained by the community – Oranje, in Cape Town, and Arcadia, in Johannesburg. For many years, Isaac Ochberg was President of the Cape Town Jewish Orphanage and continued to keep a close eye on his orphans. Many of his protégés growing up became pillars of the highly regarded South African Jewish community.\n\nIsaac Ochberg died in November 1937 during a ship trip, aged 59. He was a generous patron of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the KKL, to whom he made a legacy in his will, something around 100 million dollars in present value, which to this day remains the largest donation ever made to this institution by an individual. These resources were used to recover a large area in Israel called Nahalat Yitzhak Ochberg, where the kibbutzim Dalia and Ein Hashofet.\n\nHis life is inspiration and the reason for existence for the more than 3.000 descendants of “his orphans” and some films and books have been written about this passionate saga. These descendants and Keren Kaiemet Leisrael - KKL paid tribute to his memory in July 2011 by creating the Isaac Ochberg Memorial at the Ramot Menashe Biospheric Park Scenic Viewpoint. The inauguration was attended by numerous descendants of Ochberg's orphans from Israel, the United Kingdom, the United States and South Africa.\n\nDocumented history\n\nThe rescue operation engineered by Ochberg was the subject of a documentary made by producer and director John Blair, who won the Oscar for best documentary in 1995 for his work “Anne Frank Remembered”. Entitled “Orphans of Ochberg”, it is a moving account of the adventure and brings testimonies from some survivors and their descendants.\n\nWhen Blair began producing the documentary, he ran an ad on The Jerusalem Post asking for information about South African philanthropist Isaac Ochberg. One day, journalist David Kaplan, from Post, received a call from a woman who identified herself as 90-year-old Cecilia Harris, who lived in Haifa, and told him, in a trembling voice: “I am one of the orphans from Ochberg.” Cecilia was three years old when she was taken with her two sisters to South Africa. A few months after the telephone conversation, she took part in the filming of the documentary in Eastern Europe. The production also featured the participation of Liebe Klug, daughter of Alexander Bobrow.\n\nFanny (Frier) Lockitch, current president of the Oranje Jewish Orphanage in Cape Town, is one of the children rescued by Ochberg: “I was born in Voronesz, but I have almost no memories of there. My father was in the Russian army and died during a gas attack; my mother died in 1918. Someone took me and my brother Jack (he now lives in Rhodesia), two years older, to an orphanage in Brest-Litovsk.\n\nLife wasn't easy, but the fact that we were together made the situation a little better. Although the war had already ended, there was a lack of everything: food, clothing, coal and, above all, affection and care. To give you an idea of ​​how unstable the situation was, one day there were Russians circulating around the city, the next there were Poles. Through the windows of the orphanage we saw hand-to-hand fights with bayonets and bodies thrown into the streets.\n\nOne day, we were told that a man would come from Africa to take some of us and offer us a new home, on the other side of the world. We didn't really know what to think and had mixed feelings. Although we were excited about going to a beautiful country, we had heard stories about thieves and wild animals and were afraid of being eaten by lions, cannibals or even being sold into slavery. All our fears, however, disappeared when Isaac Ochberg appeared with his red hair and captivating smile. We all immediately fell in love with him and started calling him 'Daddy Ochberg'. He was able to spend hours talking to us, playing jokes and hugging us... Never, until the day I die, will I forget the first time I saw the lights of Cape Town and then the warm welcome we were given. done. It felt like half the city's population was waiting for us.”"
