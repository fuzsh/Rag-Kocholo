        "text": "Level of strenuous effort: Basic | Recommendable season: Throughout the entire year | Classification by region: Carmel Center and Menashe | Duration of the hike: 1-2 hours\n\nHaShofet Stream. Photograph: Alexander Kolomoisky, the KKL-JNF Photo Archive\n\nAny kind of motor vehicle is forbidden from entering the trail.\n\nIt is forbidden to ride a bicycle on the accessible trail.\n\nIt is forbidden to sleep in the stream area.\n\nIt is forbidden to start a fire on the stream, and it is likewise forbidden to hold events in the area of the stream.\n\nThe site houses a small number of parking places for buses, at the entrance to the accessible trail.\n\nA hike in HaShofet Stream is an experience for the entire family. Here, near Yokneam and kibbutz HaZorea, amidst hills decorated with forest trees, the water of the stream is moving in leaps and bounds alongside the trail. The hiker is about to encounter on his way rich vegetation typical of stream banks, a small waterfall, the remains of a flour mill, along with a spring gushing from a hewn aqueduct. During the winter, the steam flows powerfully, and the slopes surrounding it offer a magnificent, carpet-like view of anemones and cyclamens, and of many other flowers as well. Towards the end of the summer, the water tide in the stream grows weaker, but the hikers always enjoy, during all the seasons of the year, the shadow of wild trees and forest trees planted by KKL-JNF.\n\nAccessibility in the Trail\n\nKKL-JNF has put in place in the steam a circular trail measuring 1.6 kms in length, and paid special attention to the means of accessibility in it. The trail, which is paved over its entire length, is accessible to strollers and for people with disability. A \"floating trail\" made of concrete was paved at the location where floods are much more likely to occur, so that the water may run beneath it.\n\nPlaced along the trail are information signs in Hebrew, English and Arabic, and the information in Hebrew is also linguistically presented simply (simple language that is adequate for people with cognitive disabilities).\n\nSignposts were adapted for visually impaired people: the arrows showing the walking direction are salient, and it is possible to palpate them.\n\nThe poles bear bold numbers, which are digitally linked to the information on the KKL-JNF website. Salient dividing lines on the floor of the trail, which mark close proximity to a bench, or to an interesting site, are additional help for the visually impaired.\n\nAny kind of motor vehicle is forbidden from entering the trail. Riding a bicycle on the accessible trail is forbidden. Sleeping in the area is not possible, and it is forbidden to start fire or to hold events in the area of the site.\n\nThe Ramat Menashe Park Lobby is situated on Road 66, between HaZorea and the access to Road 6953. A large brown sign directs visitors to Ramat Menashe Park, and you have to drive form there following the signage leading to HaShofet Stream.\n\nThe upper tributaries of HaShofet Stream start their course near the kibbutzim Ein HaShofet and Ramat HaShofet. Ein HaShofet was founded in 1937, and it is named after Judge Louis Brandeis, a devoted Zionist activist and the first Jew to hold office in the Supreme Court of the US. He is known for the famous verse he wrote in one of his books: \"Sunlight is the best disinfectant\". Ramat HaShofet was founded in 1941, and it is named after Julian Mack, American Jewish judge who served as the President of the Zionist Organization of America. And after whom is HaShofet Stream named? We will give you the right to choose…\n\nHaShofet stream starts near kibbutz Ein HaShofet. The stream crosses the eastern slopes of Ramot Menashe - an area that is constructed, for the most part, of bright chalk rocks, in which flint rocks are embedded.\n\nThe chalk rocks are soft, and they are easily washed away in rain, thus they usually create a landscape consisting of round hills. After the stream runs for about 6 km, it enters kibbutz HaZorea, getting abruptly out of it and making its appearance in Jezreel Valley. In the valley, the stream flows in a ditch for about another 3 km and then joins the Kishon stream.\n\nHaZorea Forest spans an area of about 5,000 dunams, on the eastern slopes of Ramot Menashe. The first plantations in the forest were done by members of kibbutz HaZorea, who worked for the KKL-JNF in the 1930s.\n\nUntil then, the slopes surrounding HaShofet were bare of trees. It is primarily pine and cypress trees, and few plots of carob trees that are planted in the forest, which is one of the oldest KKL-JNF forests. Planted in the ravines, which are rich in soil, are primarily eucalyptus trees.\n\nKKL-JNF has put in place in the forest recreational camping sites, and many hikers walk and bike on its trails. Passing through the forest is Megiddo trail, a hiking trail measuring about 73 km in length, which surrounds Ramot Menashe. The trail is marked with purple trail makingtrail. Additionally, KKL-JNF marked two circular bike trails measuring about 30 km in length, which surround HaShofet stream and Gahar stream.\n\nKKL-JNF performs forestry treatments in HaZorea forest, which include thinning trees for the purpose of stimulating the development of natural groves. As a result of these treatments, wild species gain ground in the sub-forest, including Gall Oak, Atlantic Terebinth, Palestinian Terebinth, Carob (Ceratonia siliqua) and broad-leaved buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus)\n\nIn normal times, water flows in HaShofet Stream all year round, although at the end of the summer the rate of flow on the stream is lower. Consequently, the stream is capable of maintaining a rich vegetation typical of stream banks. Especially conspicuous are common reed, giant reed and hedgerows of Rubus sanctus. The climber Smilax aspera, which has thorny stalks and heart shaped leaves, is very widespread as well.\n\nWillow trees (Salis acmophylla), which may be recognized by their elongated leaves and by their cracked tree trunk bark, are also present on the banks of the stream. Willow gets easily reproduced from branches that got broken and stuck in the mud, therefore it is very suited for stream banks. Alongside the stream, laurel may be found occasionally. Its leaves, in dark green color, exude a special fragrance, and they are used as a spice (\"bay leaves\").\n\nA special phenomenon in HaShofet stream is a sub-forest of broad-leaved buckthorn buses, which grow under the shadow of the planted pine trees. The bush may be recognized by its sparkling leaves that have serrated edges.\n\nParticularly interesting are the hairy elm trees, one of the rarest wild trees in Israel. KKL-JNF collects seeds from local elm trees, germinating them until they grow into seedlings in the KKL-JNF nurseries in Eshtaol and planting them in Ramot Menashe for the purpose of bringing about a recovery of the tree population.\n\nGrowing in the upper reaches of HaShofet stream is the rare Iris plant (Iris grant duffii), whereas on HaShnaim stream, one of the tributaries of HaShofet stream, rose (Rosa Phoenicia) flowers in late spring.\n\nSouthernmost in the World\n\nHairy elm trees are widespread in southern Europe and in the Middle East, but they are very rare in the Israeli nature. This is a deciduous tree in the winter time, which is easily recognizable in the remaining seasons of the year by its asymmetrical leaves. Ramot Menashe is probably the southernmost region in the world where this wild tree grows. A sign near the waterfall of HaShofet stream tells the story of this tree.\n\nFauna\n\nThe fauna In the stream and in its surroundings benefits from plentiful water, from tilled fields and from open spaces. As many hikers enjoy their outing in the accessible trail, large mammals, such as boars and deers (gazelle) that live in the region, stay away from the trail during the day time. Also active in the surrounding are smaller mammals, including jungle cat, golden jackal, common badger and mongoose.\n\nA survey that checked the inventory of fowls in the stream section lying between Emek HaShalom (\"Peace Valley\") Farm and kibbutz HaZorea, found 26 fowl species, and it may be assumed that the number of species is even larger. Nesting in the thicket of the vegetation on the stream are at least six species, including blackbird, warbler (Sylvia melanocephala), graceful Prinia and large tit.\n\nIn the drainage basin of the stream, rare fowls were also found, such as francolin, western marsh harrier, lesser kestrel and collared pratincole. Particularly conspicuous is the jay, a colorful bird in blue, brown, black and white. This vociferous bird has, at times, the habit of following hikers, in the hope of getting a crumb that would fall into their beak.\n\nSwimming in the shallow ponds and also in seasonal springs are tadpoles of amphibians – green toad, river frog and triton (Triturus vittatus). These animals need for reproduction bodies of water. The overwhelming majority of the winter puddles, which used to be prevalent in Israel in the past, no longer exists, and thus the importance of the water sources in HaShofet stream and in its surroundings is greater. Tadpoles of amphibian, in relatively large numbers, were found in ponds, in which the visitors do not get into the water, for instance in the area of the hydrometric station.\n\nThe Stream in the Past\n\nAlong HaShofet stream findings were discovered, which attest to human settlement in ancient times. In Tel Parur, which is located in the upper reaches of Hashofet stream, remains of settlement were uncovered dating back at least to the Neolithic era (about 10,000 years ago). Eusebius, the bishop of Caesaria in the fourth century A.D., mentions a settlement by the name of Aparia, at a distance of about six miles to the north of Legio (Megiddo), and it is entirely possible that he means the settlement that was situated in Tel Parur.\n\nThe accessible trail is in the shadow of the large hill of Tel Kira. Here too, on the northern side of the hill and in close proximity to Snin stream, vestiges were uncovered of settlements that exist from prehistoric periods to the Roman period. Throughout those generations, the residents used the soft rock of the Tel to hew caves that were used, among other things, as burial estates, water pits, places for keeping animals, as well as for residential and additional uses. Some of the caves were used by the residents of the small village Kira also in the 20th century.\n\nThree flour mills used to operate in the stream. Few vestiges remain of the uppermost of them, at the foot of moshav Ein HaEmek. The structures of the mill situated on the accessible side of the trail, and the one situated within the bounds of kibbutz HaZorea remained in much better condition.\n\nEven before the declaration of independence, four settlements were established in close proximity to the stream: the colony (Moshava) Yokneam was founded in 1935; kibbutz HaZorea was founded one year later. Kibbutz Ramat HaShofet, after which the stream is named, was founded in 1941, and moshav Ein Emek in 1944.\n\nMajor Sites\n\nThe route of the hike goes down along the brook of Snin stream, one of the tributaries of HaShofet stream up to the confluence of the streams. From that point, keep going down HaShofet stream, until the Camels Cave and the flour mill. From there, go up to Ein Hashrat and go back, in the shadow of the trees of HaZorea forest, to the starting point. The major sites along the route are as follows:\n\nThe Ponds of Snin Stream\n\nShallow artificial ponds, which aid in making the waterflow on the steam more moderate, mainly during floods, and thus contribute to preventing the banks from getting washed away. The place is one of the charming corners of the stream.\n\nHaShofet Stream Waterfall\n\nThe small waterfall and the pond at its foot form together a picturesque place. An accessible observation deck overlooking the waterfall. Growing near the pond are hairy elm trees. After the rains, the waterfall flows vehemently.\n\nHydrometric Station Named after Paul Gilad\n\nThe modest concrete dam, which extends over the stream channel, forms the base of the hydrometric station operated by the hydrological service of the Water Authority. Its function is to create a section in the steam having a known area. The facility measures the height of the water level during floods, as well as the velocity of its flow, and based upon these data it is possible to calculate the rate of the water flow. Paul Gilad was the Director at the Water Authority in charge of hydrometrics in the northern district.\n\nThe Water Canal of Kibbutz HaZorea\n\nKibbutz HaZorea was founded in 1936, in the lower reaches of HaShofet stream. The kibbutz suffered initially from lack of water. Under inspiration from an ancient canal, which used to transport water from HaShofet stream for the purpose of operating an old flour mill, the kibbutz members constructed a canal of their own. A tiny dam, which lies at the head of the canal, diverted water away from the stream onto the irrigation pond built at the very center of the kibbutz. The \"nostril\" lying before the tiny dam inhaled the water and transported it to the canal.\n\nThe Camels Cave\n\nThe large cave, like the rest of the caves in Ramot Menashe, was hewn by people. We do not know when the cave was hewn, and it may have served as a quarry, from which the stone for constructing the nearby flour mill was produced. According to the mythology of kibbutz HaZorea, camels used to be housed in the caves, which assisted in the 1950s in the works of removing trunks that were felled after a fire that had broken out in the forest.\n\nThe Flour Mill\n\nThis mill is the middle one among the three flour mills that operated in the past in HaShofet stream. Remnants of the upper mill are found at the foot of moshav Ein HaEmerk, and the lower one lies within the bounds of kibbutz HaZorea. It appears that only in winter time quantities of water used to flow in the stream, which were sufficient for operating the mills.\n\nEin Hashrat\n\nThis extremely beautiful spring gushes from aqueducts that are hewn into a pond that is hewn in the rock. In the past, water used to be diverted from the pond to cultivated tracts of land. Alongside the pond, a curved nook (niche) was hewn. The spring may have been used as a Nymphaeum (a place of water worship), and a statue of the god, in whose honor the ceremony took place, was placed in the nook.\n\nThe Hebrew name of the spring preserves the sound of its Arabic name - Ein Al-Mahshura. \"Hashrat Mayim\" in Hebrew is an eloquent expression for a cloud, as written in the Bible – \"Dark rain cloud of the sky\" (Samuel II, 22, 12). Kibbutz HaZorea dedicated the spring to the memory of Ami Bar-Ner, a member of the kubbutz, who was killed in the line of duty.\n\nFurther Possibilities of Hiking in the Area\n\nFrom the Big Compound to Ramot Menashe Park Lobby.\n\nThis is suitable for fit walkers. A vehicle has to be arranged for picking up the hikers at the end of the route.\n\nStarting Point: The large parking lot of Big Yokneam. The suitable season: spring, autumn, winter (the route is exposed to the sun). In January there are plenty of anemones, and later in the winter - a variety of colorful wild flowers. The end point: Ramot Menashe Park Lobby, in close proximity to Road 66.\n\nLength: 5.0 km\n\nDescription of the Route: Go down from the Big Compound, on the channel of Snin stream, heading to the trail of HaShofet stream. From the Camels Cave, continue following the marking of Megiddo trail (purple trail marking). The trail goes a little bit down in HaShofet stream and then goes up, to the old cemetery of kibbutz HaZorea.\n\nAt the very center of the cemetery, turn left to the observation deck, and go down in the forest, to a road following the fence of the kibbutz and the Plastopil plant. Go through a vehicle barrier at the northern edge of a paved road (Old Road 66) and go southwards. After about half a kilometer, you can turn to the east, on a short road leading to Ein Zarik. After visiting the spring, under the shadow of fig trees, keep going on that road until the Park Lobby.\n\nKKL-JNF for the Benefit of the Community\n\nThe Biospherical Space Megiddo\n\nOver the last decades, scientists and leaders have begun to be aware of the enormous pressure exerted upon vital life systems - water, air and biosphere . This understanding was translated into a new action program, \"Man and the Biosphere\", which perceives man as part of the system.\n\nThe program, which was developed by UNESCO, strives to motivate communities to work towards developing sustainable development in their surroundings. KKL-JNF, in collaboration with the Megiddo Regional Council and the residents of the 13 localities in said Council, worked to create the Megiddo Biospherical Space, which spans an area of 197,000 dunams within the bounds of the Council.\n\nThe Biospherical Space won the recognition of UNESCO in 2011, and it comprises forests, nature reserves, agricultural areas and pasture fields. HaShofet stream is at the very heart of the Megiddo Biospherical Space."
