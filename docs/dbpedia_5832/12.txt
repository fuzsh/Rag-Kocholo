Nahal HaShofet (“Judge’s Stream”), tucked away within Ramat Menashe Park in northwest Israel, has recently reopened its gates to visitors following extensive reconstruction.

This scenic natural spring â known for its human-planted forests, oak groves and tranquil streams â suffered damage to infrastructure and amenities in 2020 due to flooding.

Taking advantage of this unfortunate situation, the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael – Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) launched a series of comprehensive revitalization efforts to restore the park to its former glory.

The restoration efforts focused on rebuilding damaged trails, enhancing safety measures and creating a more inclusive environment for visitors of all abilities.

One of the hallmarks of Nahal HaShofet’s transformation is inclusivity and accessibility. Thoughtfully designed pathways, strategically placed directional signs and accessible facilities ensure that every visitor can enjoy the park’s natural wonders.

Picnic areas, meandering walking trails, scenic viewpoints and the soothing sounds of flowing streams are more than enough reasons to check out the newly reopened park.

Chairwoman of KKL-JNF Yiftah Ovadia Luski lauded the project as âone of the [more] important projects carried out by KKL-JNF in recent years.â

âFollowing the destruction, comprehensive restoration of the stream was required,â she continued. âThe restoration allows all Israelis to fully enjoy and experience the stream.â

The larger Ramat Menashe Park was recognized as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in June 2011.

Nahal HaShofetâs reopening is the product of a synergy between KKL-JNF and the Megiddo Regional Council. It heralds a new era of management under KKL-JNF, with a dedicated team overseeing visitor services and onsite engagement activities.

âNahal HaShofet is a special gem in the heart of the forest that attracts crowds of hikers. It’s a beautiful green view in the Menashe area, and we are delighted to arrive at the moment of opening, especially with the arrival of spring at its peak,â said Ovadia Luski.Â

âWe invite the public to come, enjoy, and of course, preserve nature.”
