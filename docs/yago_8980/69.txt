The Roomies #29 - Because Neela has changed Ray Barnett in the last 2 years, period.

Welcome to ROOMIEVILLE... An Appreciation Thread for Ray/Neela

Hop aboard the Insanity Express to Loserville, a sister thread for Morris and Jane.

Made by Just Tracy

This thread is devoted to the pairing of Neela Rasgotra and Ray Barnett. Neela is a smart, by-the-book girl, and Ray is a doctor, in a rock-band boy's body. Both met in season 11 and the hints and sparks have been flying since. From the first casual flirt, to the snowballs thrown, to the invitation to become roommates, these two are meant to be. And this is just the beginning of their story.

Need more reasons? Check out the Ray/Neela Ship_Manifesto essay over at Livejournal: How Come No One Told Me You Were Such A Badass?, by Fi (fc2001)
