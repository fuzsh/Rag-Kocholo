The rest of us have to endure a storyline in which the good-looking Croatian Dr Kovac and an increasingly frantic Sam drive across the country in search of her diabetic young son who's run away to be with his dad. This means a lot of talk between the two, coupled with drippy background music. It's more exciting back in the hospital, where Ray, Neela and Abby are being evaluated as they struggle to treat patients and teach the interns.\n\nRT reviewer: Jane Rackham\n\nDr Abby Lockhart - Maura Tierney\n\nDr Gregory Pratt - Mekhi Phifer\n\nDr Luka Kovac - Goran Visnjic\n\nSam Taggart - Linda Cardellini\n\nDr Kerry Weaver - Laura Innes\n\nDr Susan Lewis - Sherry Stringfield\n\nDr Ray Barnett - Shane West\n\nArchie Morris - Scott Grimes\n\nDr Neela Rasgotra - Parminder Nagra\n\nJane Figler - Sara Gilbert\n\nAlex Taggart - Dominic Janes\n\nDori - Kyle Richards\n\nChuny - Laura Ceron\n\nFrank - Troy Evans\n\nOlbes - Lynn A Henderson\n\nHaleh - Yvette Freeman\n\n.\n\nyou're welcome\n\nSUNDAY 08 JANUARY\n\nDrama\n\nER\n\n8:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nE4\n\nVIDEO Plus+: 51751999\n\nSubtitled, Audio-described\n\nCanon City\n\nMedical drama series.
