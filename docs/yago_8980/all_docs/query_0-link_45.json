        "text": "On any given prime-time drama, it's expected that characters will pair up as often as they break apart. But throw in the high-stress setting of an emergency room, and the emotional dial gets cranked up to 11. Over the course of its 15-season run, ER had wild romances, one-time flings, and more than a few couplings that had fans raising eyebrows (Neela and Tony, anyone?). But there were also plenty of underrated ER couples that were pretty much soulmates, even if their relationships aren't the first ones folks think of when remembering County General Hospital.\n\nThe early draw of ER was its realism in depicting the pure chaos of an emergency room, with the constant flow of incoming patients and doctors thinking on their feet. Though in later years, things got a bit more dramatic (hospital security must've been pretty bad for everyone to get held hostage and shot up so frequently), the show kept fans following until the very end, and that's due in part to the many irresistible relationships we couldn't get enough of. Seriously, thanks to these romances, ER stuck the landing to stay in fans' hearts long after the show left the air. So, let's revisit some of the very best."
