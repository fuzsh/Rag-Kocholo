It was an amazing show with great storylines and a great cast as well as very good guest stars.\n\nSo I just wanted to see if there are any other super fans out there. Whoâ€™s your fave dr, nurse? Fave episodes? Storyline....\n\nMy fave characters were. Doug Ross, Carol Hathaway, Luka Kovac, John carter, ray Barnett, gregg Pratt and Neela rasgotra\n\nMy fave episodes were the one where Ross rescues the kid from the storm drain, the one where Carol realises sheâ€™s still in love with Ross, the one where dr green causes a mass shooting due to his interference with a father and son, marks last days, the one when Carter goes to the Congo to find Luka, the one where the helicopter falls on top of Romano, the one where Neela finds out about rays accident, the one where gregg is in a the ambulance blast.\n\nSo if you can remember share your faves ðŸ˜Š"
