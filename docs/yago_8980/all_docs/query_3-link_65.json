        "text": "Obituary\n\nRaymond Clifford Barnett, age 78, of Lisle, IL, died peacefully at home on October 11, 2021. Beloved husband of Lois Joanne Barnett (nee Gracen) for 55 wonderful years; devoted and fun father of Lisa Ann (Gavin Cross) Barnett and Catherine Colette Barnett; proud grandfather of Fiona Zoe Barnett-Cross; dear brother-in-law of Arthur (Christine) Gracen; loving brother of Colette (Michael) Sulser and preceded in death by siblings Mary (Jerry) Jorgenson, Lowell (Beth Richards) Barnett, and William (Alta) Barnett, and parents Lowell and Colette (nee Dunn) Barnett.\n\nRay was known for his kindness, intelligence, quick wit, and larger-than-life personality. His daughters inherited his love of learning, his irreverent sense of humor, and his powerful sweet tooth. He was a great “pet dad” to a menagerie of animals throughout his life, most recently of the perfect Boston terrier Toby, and sweet mixed breed “Daddy’s girl” Molly, who stayed by his side when he was not feeling well and who will miss him very much.\n\nFortunate to have had a career that he loved, Ray spent 37 years as a high school chemistry teacher. While a student at Fenwick High School in Oak Park, IL., chemistry teacher Father Fisher sparked his love for chemistry and showed how great teachers can have a lasting impact on their students’ lives. As a teacher, Ray’s natural enthusiasm spilled over into his classroom, where he made up songs, told jokes, and otherwise connected with his students to make the sometimes complex and dry subject interesting, fun, and relevant to them. He spent his first three years teaching chemistry at Fenwick, and the next 34 years at Evanston Township High School in Evanston, IL. He found great pleasure in helping others learn and truly loved his workdays as much as his weekends. Once retired, Ray enjoyed spending time with friends and family, being outdoors golfing and tending to his gardens, continuing his life-long love of the Chicago Cubs, and watching Jeopardy!, during which he yelled out a majority of the answers correctly, but not in the form of a question. He never wished to be a contestant, however, saying his thumb would be too slow to press the buzzer.\n\nLoyal friend to many, Ray brought a smile wherever he went and will be missed by all who knew him.\n\nPrivate interment service for immediate family at Windridge Memorial Park and Nature Sanctuary in Cary, IL.\n\nA celebration of Ray’s life will be held at a later date.\n\nArrangements entrusted to Hitzeman Funeral Home, Ltd., 9445 W. 31st Street, Brookfield, IL 60513.\n\nMemorials may be made to Brookfield Zoo, 3300 Golf Rd, Brookfield, IL 60513 or The Morton Arboretum, 4100 IL-53, Lisle, IL 60532 or The Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation, 230 E Ohio St, Chicago, IL 60611\n\nFor information, call 708-485-2000 or go to www.HitzemanFuneral.com\n\nIf you would like to express your condolences here, click the link below. Sympathy cards may be mailed directly to the family, or can be sent to Hitzeman Funeral Home, 9445 W. 31st Street, Brookfield, IL 60513, c/o The Raymond Barnett Family.
