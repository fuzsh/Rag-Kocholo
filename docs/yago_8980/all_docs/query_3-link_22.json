        "text": "Ray Barnett, a Northern Ireland-born minister who immigrated to Canada in the late 1950s, has devoted his life to helping persecuted Christians and people in need throughout the world. He is the founder of Friends in the West, a Christian-based human rights organization that has helped secure the release of numerous Christians imprisoned for their faith throughout Eastern Europe and Africa, and has spearheaded humanitarian aid missions in Lebanon, Uganda, Southern Sudan, Somalia and other volatile regions across the globe. He is also the founder of the African Children’s Choir, a world-renowned organization that has provided an education, healing and hope to thousands of African children—including nearly 1,200 children who have gone through the African Children’s Choir program. With “Daddy Ray” as their advocate, these children have been cared for as one of his own, receiving the love, support and education they need to succeed—and give back to Africa and the world.
