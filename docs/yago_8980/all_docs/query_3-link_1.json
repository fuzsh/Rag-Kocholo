        "text": "Herman “Coach” Ray Barnett went to be with the Lord on Friday, July 12, 2024, surrounded by his family.\n\nBorn November 3, 1947, in Port Arthur, TX, to Rex and Sydnie Barnett, Ray was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed horseback riding, hunting, fishing, water skiing, and many different sports. During his tenure in the Clinton Public School system, Coach Barnett, as he was affectionately known, influenced thousands of lives as a teacher, coach, and counselor. One of his greatest accomplishments was helping start the championship CHS soccer program, of which his son Brad and grandson Cody were both members.\n\nRay had many accomplishments, awards, and accolades in his life, but the accomplishment of which he was most proud was his sons and their families.\n\nRay was preceded in death by his parents, his sister Susan, and his wife Sue, the love of his life to whom he was married for 39 years.\n\nHe is survived by his sons Steven (Cheryl) of Petersburg, TN and Brad (Terri) of Clinton; grandchildren Matthew, Benjamin, Samantha, and Cody Barnett; sister Sheila Mitchell (Stan) and brother Ernest Barnett of Picayune; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nVisitation is from 4-6 PM on Sunday, July 14 at Chancellor Funeral Home in Byram, with a celebration of life service on Monday, July 15 at 11 AM with visitation prior to the service at 10 AM in the chapel at Chancellor.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Shepherd’s Inn (shepherds-inn.org), a ministry close to his heart."
