        "text": "A graveside service for Billy Charles Barnett, 70, will be held Sunday, March 3, 2024 at 3:00 p.m. at Pleasant Hill Cemetery, 552 Pleasant Hill Cemetery Rd., Plain Dealing, Louisiana. A visitation will be held from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. at Rose-Neath Funeral Home, 2201 Airline Dr., Bossier City, Louisiana. Officiating the service will be Reverend Calvin Hubbart.\n\nBilly was born on February 14, 1954 to Linden Ray Barnett and Clara Gray Matlock Barnett in Springhill, Louisiana and passed away Friday, February 29, 2024 at his residence in Bossier City, Louisiana.\n\nBilly will always be remembered for his passion for the outdoors. An avid fisherman and hunter, he found solace and joy in nature’s beauty. Beyond his love for the great outdoors, Billy had a soft spot for classic Western films. He found comfort in watching them and would often lose himself in the tales of the old West.\n\nA dedicated family man, Billy had a daily tradition that brought him immense happiness. Each morning, without fail, he would sit down with his wife to watch “Leave It to Beaver” and “Looney Tunes” while sipping on their morning coffee. These simple yet precious moments captured the essence of their enduring love and companionship.\n\nAmongst all his interests and hobbies, perhaps none held a more special place in Billy’s heart than his dog, Clyde. To Billy, Clyde was not just a pet but a cherished member of the family, a loyal companion who brought endless joy into his life. You will be forever remembered as a true outdoorsman, devoted husband, doting father, and loyal friend.\n\nBilly was preceded in death by his parents and brother, Ronald Ray Barnett, Sr. He is survived by his loving wife of 33 years, Theresa Austin Barnett; daughters, Angela Barnett Beard, Cristina Barnett Sitter; son, Nathan Barnett and grandchildren, Ethan Beard and Anna Sitter.\n\nHonoring Billy as pallbearers will be Tony Nesse, Larry Anderson, Jerry Kruise, and Barry Budwah. Serving as honorary pallbearers will be W.D. Boatner, Randy Matlock, Rusty Beard, Mike Rich, and Dick Davidson.\n\nThe family suggests memorials may be made to Lumberjack Rescue, 1122 Reynolds St., Springhill, Louisiana 71075, and St. Jude Children’s Hospital, Donors@stjude.org."
