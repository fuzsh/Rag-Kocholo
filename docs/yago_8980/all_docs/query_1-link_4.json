        "text": "Supreme Fan\n\nJoined: Feb 2001\n\nPosts: 9,282\n\nThe Roomies #29 - Because Neela has changed Ray Barnett in the last 2 years, period.\n\nWelcome to ROOMIEVILLE... An Appreciation Thread for Ray/Neela\n\nHop aboard the Insanity Express to Loserville, a sister thread for Morris and Jane.\n\nMade by Just Tracy\n\nThis thread is devoted to the pairing of Neela Rasgotra and Ray Barnett. Neela is a smart, by-the-book girl, and Ray is a doctor, in a rock-band boy's body. Both met in season 11 and the hints and sparks have been flying since. From the first casual flirt, to the snowballs thrown, to the invitation to become roommates, these two are meant to be. And this is just the beginning of their story.\n\nNeed more reasons? Check out the Ray/Neela Ship_Manifesto essay over at Livejournal: How Come No One Told Me You Were Such A Badass?, by Fi (fc2001)\n\n*Obsession City- Capital of Roomieville*\n\n1) Because they balance each other out\n\n2) Because he called her Dr. Jumbomart\n\n3) Because he offered her a place to stay\n\n4) Because he wanted her to live with him.... and you know it!\n\n5) Because it's going to be interesting to see the 'living arrangments'\n\n6) Because even though they might kill each other, it's gonna be fun to watch!\n\n7) Because he said \"I love you\" to her\n\n8) Because she replied saying \"you owe me 80 bucks\"... which is code for \"I love you too!\"\n\n9) Because they're roomies\n\n10) Because Neela helped Ray after he got punched\n\n11) Because Neela was about to punch someone for him\n\n12) Because they went shopping together\n\n13) Because she took him to Duluth with her\n\n14) Because he grabbed her when they saw the body\n\n15) Because The Bump was NOT an accident!\n\n16) Because even Gallant can't get between them!\n\n17) Because she's a badass too!\n\n18) Because she is getting used to finding random rockers passed out in THEIR livingroom!\n\n19) Because him 'telling' her to get it on with his rocker friend is just another link in the long line of the state that is DENIAL..which we all know just ain't a river in Egypt my friend.. lol (props to theirishgirl for that)\n\n20) Because before she played the viola, she wanted to play rock music.... just like Ray.\n\n21) Because he's cleaning the bathroom with actual cleaning products for her...\n\n22) And she's popping a finger back into place for him\n\n23) Because its Beauty and the Badass...(props to DaveAbbyLuver for thinking of that)\n\n24) Because Neela's a good girl and liking a bad boy comes naturally\n\n25) Because she totally checked him out when they first met!\n\n26) Because Pratt thinks there's hope for them yet!\n\n27) Because she slapped Morris for him!\n\n28) Because he gave her credit for the patient\n\n29) Because she owes him\n\n30) Because he'll take her next prolapsed rectum.\n\n31) Because she told him he looked tired and he should go home.\n\n32) Because they're totally not sticking to opposite shifts.\n\n33) Because he helped her with the femoral cutdown.\n\n34) Because his friends love her, and even though she pretends not to, she likes them too.\n\n35) Because she yelled at him and he did the right thing.\n\n36) Because that handshake was never just a handshake\n\n37) Because he can't keep his eyes off of her\n\n38) Because they've had too many electric moments for things to stay purely platonic.\n\n39) Because you know what they say about first impressions!\n\n40) Because he smiles the most when he's around her\n\n41) Because Jumbomart is \"their\" place\n\n42) Because they always lean towards each other\n\n43) Because even fake spoilers want them together\n\n44) Because our minds are dirtier than their apartment!\n\n45) Because we know that they (Shane & Parminder) see it too.....too many random looks and leanings to prove otherwise\n\n46) Because it must be fate!\n\n47) Because it's written in the stars!\n\n48) Because they go together like strawberries and cream!\n\n49) Because we need more than just a handshake!\n\n50) Because strawberries will never be the same again!\n\n51) Because we need The Roomies to stop irishgirl from starting the Ray/Archie thread (props to Neel for this one)\n\n52) Because he warned her about the antifreeze thingamajigger (props to Neel)\n\n53) Because she accidentally bumped into him...... again! (props to Neel)\n\n54) Because he gives her the first choice of what intern she wants. (props to Dingbat)\n\n55) Because we know he purposely picked the number closest to Neela's (props to Dingbat)\n\n56) Because now she knows what she's missing! (props to IrishGirl)\n\n57) Because he wouldn't let her concentrate on writing something to Gallant! (props to tigger21)\n\n58) Because she was dissappointed the beer was not for her.
