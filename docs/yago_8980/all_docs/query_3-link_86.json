        "text": "Mafrey Barnett Ray, age 85, of the Possum Trot Community, went Home to be with the Lord on Wednesday, July 24th, 2024 after a courageous battle with Parkinsonâs disease.Â A native of the Pigeon Roost Community in Mitchell County, she was a daughter of the late Arkie and Rhea âMarieâ Barnett.Â She was preceded in death as well by her husband, Lawrence Ray, who passed away in 2016; two sisters:Â Tina Bennett and Juanita Bennett Hylemon; and a brother, Teddy J. Barnett.\n\nMafrey worked at Burnsville Hosiery Mill for more than 30 years, as well as raising her three children. She attended Pleasant Valley Baptist Church for a number of years, and later attended Landmark Baptist Church, known in the community as Higgins Baptist Church.Â She enjoyed gardening and canning, but always felt like her greatest accomplishment in life was being a wife, mother, sister and grandmother.\n\nLeft to cherish her memory are two daughters:Â Deborah Metcalf (Clifford) of Burnsville and Nancy Barefoot (Kenny) of Chocowinity; son, Andrew Ray of Possum Trot; five grandchildren:Â Jeremy (Jody), Jason, Hayden, Anna Grace (Heath) and Collin; six great-grandchildren; three sisters:Â Yvonne Peterson of Green Mountain, Sue Peterson of Weaverville and Annette Dill of Green Mountain; as well as a brother, Cleave Barnett of Johnson City, TN.Â Several nieces, nephews, cousins and other extended family survive her as well."
