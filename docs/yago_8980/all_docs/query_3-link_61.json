        "text": "Summary: Abby and Luka are wrapping up an overnight shift with no patients to pass on to the day shift. Luka lets Weaver know the good news, then adds the bad news that there’s no attending for the next shift, since Clemente hasn’t arrived. As the chief of the ER, that’s Luka’s problem to solve. Dubenko offers to stay “for a few minutes,” which I’m sure is all he’ll be needed for.\n\nRay tries to sneak by Weaver, who asks him why he’s there, since he kind of, sort of resigned. He pretends not to know what she’s talking about. When Weaver reminds him that he asked for leave to do something with his band, he tells her he’s not in a band. Maybe she’s misremembering because she was on painkillers the last time they talked. Ray Barnett! We do not gaslight our bosses! He tries to play it cool while he waits for her to walk away, fully knowing he hasn’t fooled her.\n\nNeela has been accepted into the surgical elective she wanted, and she’s very appreciative when Dubenko gives her the news. She heads off to tell her new husband. They’re still living at her and Ray’s apartment, but they’re going to start looking for their own place. Inez tells Ray that Zoe is there, and of course he thinks she’s just there to try to get him to talk to her, but she actually needs medical attention: She’s been beaten up. Zoe’s story is that she fell, and though Ray doesn’t believe her, he doesn’t press her to tell the truth. He says he’ll call her father but she tearfully tells him not to. He’s the one who beat her.\n\nMorris has been using K.J. as an errand boy, which Pratt immediately puts a stop to. Morris gets an orderly to take over instead. He asks Pratt for advice for an upcoming date. The woman, Tamara, is Black, and Morris has never dated “a sister” before. Pratt’s first piece of advice is the same as mine: Don’t say “a sister” again. He takes Penny, who’s apparently still here, for a case he thinks would be good for her to learn on.\n\nZoe tells Ray that she went to stay with a friend after having a fight with her father, but he waited for her after school and made her go home with him. This isn’t the first time he’s beaten her. Her only other family is a sister who lives in San Francisco. Mr. Butler doesn’t know where she is, which says a lot about his parenting, if one of his daughters has made the other one swear to keep her location from him. “I think there’s something really wrong with him,” Zoe says. You think??\n\nRay promises that the cops will put an end to Mr. Butler’s abuse. Zoe protests, but Ray says he has to report her assault. She tells him that she called the cops once and they didn’t arrest her father; the visit just made him madder. Ray swears that they’ll arrest him this time. Zoe knows he’ll likely get out of jail and come after her. She asks if she can move in with Ray. Well, he is about to have a free bedroom…\n\nThe ER is getting backed up and Dubenko hasn’t gotten into the rhythm of things yet. I’m sure Morris yelling at him will make things better. Dubenko and Pratt disagree about a patient’s treatment, with Dubenko wanting to be aggressive while Pratt suggests they be more conservative. Dubenko backs down, though he does insist on giving the patient dopamine to help her blood pressure.\n\nAbby and Luka try to get some sleep after their night shift, but she’s restless. She’s thinking about too much stuff to fall asleep. His very helpful advice: “Just stop thinking about stuff.” Thanks, Luka. Now Abby wants to tell him everything she’s thinking about. She wonders what everyone will say when they announce the pregnancy. She wants to wait a couple of weeks. Luka has already told his father, but he figures no one in Chicago will hear the news from him.\n\nAbby hasn’t said anything to Maggie, needing more time to prepare for that. Maybe as long as 15 years. While she’s stressed, Luka’s excited about having a baby with her. Abby wants something to eat; something “little,” like a Pop Tart. Of course Luka doesn’t want his baby’s mother eating junk food like that, so he says he’ll make her something. So much for sleep.\n\nDubenko’s patient, Mrs. Venema, hasn’t improved. Ray goes to him for advice on what to do with Zoe, and Dubenko reminds him that they’re mandatory reporters when it comes to child abuse. Inez brings in the patient’s husband, who explains that Mrs. V. had an aneurysm a few years ago and has been comatose ever since. They’ve known each other since they were in school together and are approaching their 52nd wedding anniversary. Mr. V. tearfully says that he knows his wife is sick, but he’s not ready to lose her. Dubenko promises that they’ll do everything they can.\n\nClemente still hasn’t surfaced, so Dubenko is still in charge. He gives Sam instructions for Mrs. V.’s treatment, but she thinks he should run it by Pratt, since he’s not an ER doctor. Pratt comes to check in and agrees with Sam that the treatment is too aggressive. Dubenko tells him that Mr. V. wants them to do everything they can. Pratt argues that Mrs. V. has no quality of life and will never improve. Her infection might be a sign that it’s time for Mr. V. to let go.\n\nA police officer questions Zoe as Ray stitches up her wounds. Liz the social worker comes in next, having been told by Dubenko that Ray needed her help. Ray complains that Dubenko, a surgeon, doesn’t know what’s needed in the ER. He thinks he can take care of Zoe’s needs on his own, especially when Liz says that if she doesn’t have other family she can go to, she’ll be sent to a group home, then foster care.\n\nNeela meets up with Gallant, who has been living it up as a househusband since he’s not working right now. He’s as thrilled about Neela’s surgical elective as she is. She has more good news: Weaver told her that he’s secured a position as a resident at County. Gallant suggests that Neela get some sleep before they go see an apartment, but she’s not tired. She offers to go with him to visit a friend in a VA hospital instead.\n\nThe ICU chief comes to the ER to see Mrs. V., siding with Pratt that her treatment is too extensive for someone in her condition. He won’t admit her to the ICU since she’s not going to get better. There aren’t enough beds. Jerry lets Pratt know that the police have brought in someone who’s asking for him. It’s Darnell, who’s under suspicion of DUI. An officer named Hollis orders Pratt to draw Darnell’s blood. Darnell worries about losing his license and job, and he begs Pratt to help him. He swears that he’s been trying to be better.\n\nAs Pratt goes looking for K.J., who Morris swears is not washing his car (again), Abby makes a list of things to do and get before the baby comes. Luka doesn’t think they need a baby monitor, since his apartment is small enough that they’ll be able to hear the baby no matter where they are. Abby replies that it might not be for there. He notes that her apartment is even smaller.\n\nShe’s happy that they have nine months to prepare, since other animals don’t. For example, rats only have a six-week gestation period. Abby threatens to throw food at Luka, who’s like, “What is going on with you and when is it going to stop?” She blames her hormones and wonders if she’s nesting. No, sweetie, that’s not nesting behavior. That’s just being weird. Luka reminds her that they have plenty of time to get everything, but Abby wants to start baby shopping right away.\n\nMr. V. thinks it’s a good sign that Dubenko has removed Mrs. V.’s tubes and monitoring. Dubenko breaks it to him that she’s not going to the ICU, not because she’s getting better but because the hospital can’t keep treating her the way they have been. Mr. V. guesses that this is really about money. Dubenko tells him that they have to make decisions every day about who will benefit from the more expensive care and who won’t. They’ll keep treating Mrs. V., but with more conservative methods. Mr. V. notes that there’s a difference between the care that’s best for his wife and the best care available.\n\nHollis thinks Pratt is stalling Darnell’s blood draw so his blood-alcohol level will drop before it’s tested. Pratt says he just wants to get K.J. out of the area so he doesn’t see Darnell right now. Hollis gives him five minutes to deal with K.J. before he gets someone else to draw the blood. Pratt ducks into a restroom to draw his own blood, then draws Darnell’s, clearly intending to swap the vials with Hollis seeing. He does exactly that, and Darnell sees.\n\nGallant and Neela go see his friend, Rogan, who was injured by a roadside bomb. He wants to go back to Iraq, and he asks Gallant to talk to someone about getting him redeployed. It’s clear that Rogan is in no shape to go back, but Gallant humors him by saying he’ll work on it. Ray tells Zoe that the police are looking for her father. He suggests that she call her sister and ask to live with her. He’ll even help her get out to San Francisco. Zoe guesses that Ray wishes he’d never met her, but he just wishes it had been a few years later.\n\nLuka’s not used to all the equipment Americans need for babies. Abby says they need two of everything, as she doesn’t intend for them all to live at his place. He jokes that if they have twins, they’ll have to get four of everything. She denies that they’ll have twins, but he tells her that identical twins run in his family. “If your mutant Croatian seed causes me to have twins–,” she begins, amused. He tells her that if there’s a custody battle, they can each take a kid. Sounds like someone just watched The Parent Trap.\n\nDubenko’s overwhelmed by his caseload, and he tells Sam and Inez to prioritize cases when things get crazy like they are. Inez tells him this is considered a slow period, since they haven’t had any traumas. Mr. V. gives Dubenko a check to pay for his wife’s ICU care for four days. It’s all the money he has. Dubenko obviously can’t accept it, and he tries to explain that there are other patients who need the ICU more than Mrs. V. does. “What are you saying? There’s not enough money to save my wife?” Mr. V. exclaims. Dubenko apologetically says there’s nothing more he can do.\n\nHollis tells Pratt that Darnell’s blood-alcohol level came back 0, so he’s just getting a ticket for running a red light. Pratt tells Darnell to get help ASAP. K.J. returns from running a personal errand for Pratt, the exact thing Pratt told Morris not to have him do. Pratt urges Darnell to go to an AA meeting at the center where Olivia works.\n\nMorris begs Pratt for dating help again, claiming it’s not because Pratt is Black but because he’s cool. Morris has trouble dating because he has supernumerary thelium. He takes Pratt to an exam area to show him that he has two extra nipples. He was bullied as a child because of them, which explains a lot about Morris. Ray pops in and Morris blasts him for not knocking. Ray points out that the door to the area is a curtain. Also, his patient is in there. Pratt tells Ray about Morris’ extra nipples, and Morris complains that he violated doctor-patient confidentiality. Ray thinks Morris should get all his nipples pierced. He’s there to ask the guys for any money they can spare.\n\nGallant tells some of Rogan’s fellow patients about a time when they somehow got their hands on a bunch of sex dolls and launched them over the desert. Neela reluctantly pulls him away so they can go see an apartment. Abby makes Luka try on a baby carrier, and a store employee becomes the first person Abby tells about her pregnancy. When she asks if the baby is their first, Luka just says yes, because it’s much easier to do that than explain the real situation.\n\nGallant was in a good mood when he was telling his story, but now he’s blue. Neela thinks it’s because Rogan is having trouble. Gallant reveals that he wants to go back to Iraq. She points out that returning to war won’t change what’s happened to his colleagues and friends. Gallant wants to go so he can prevent more people from ending up like them, or worse.\n\nNeela asks to put off the conversation until he’s thought more about it, but he’s been thinking about this for weeks. He left people back in Iraq who need him. Neela tells him she needs him. “Not like they do,” he replies. They have to cut off their disagreement when someone arrives to show them an apartment. She doesn’t catch on that she’s interrupting a huge conversation.\n\nAbby looks at maternity clothes, not looking forward to gaining wait. She spots someone from the hospital pharmacy in the store and makes Luka hide with her so they won’t be seen. Luka doesn’t think it’s a big deal if the woman sees them; he doesn’t even know who she is. Abby tells him that every woman who works at the hospital knows who he is. They sneak into a dressing room and end up making out.\n\nMr. V. tries to stop Dubenko as he’s moving Mrs. V. from the ER. Dubenko tells him that they’ve made arrangements with another hospital that has agreed to treat her in their ICU. Mr. V. wants to thank Dubenko, who just tells him to enjoy the time he has left with his wife. Mr. V. hugs him and calls him a good doctor and a good man. Dubenko should really talk to Carter about what happened with Ruby and his wife, because he’s going down the same road here.\n\nPratt is pleased to hear that Darnell told K.J. he had to go to a meeting. K.J. knows exactly what happened, since he saw Darnell with the police, and he thanks Pratt for helping him out. Pratt says it was a misunderstanding, and K.J. replies that it always is. Tamara comes by to see Morris, who calls Pratt his dog. Pratt undermines Morris’ confidence about his nipples, but Morris decides to just own them. Tamara reveals that she has an extra toe on one foot. Pratt’s dumbfounded that Morris has hit it off with a hot woman.\n\nRay sends Zoe off to the airport to catch a flight to San Francisco. He offers to pack up her stuff and send it to her. He’ll also be a go-between so she can transfer her school records without her father finding out where she is. He gives her money for a cab and anything else she might need. Zoe’s grateful but scared to leave. She reminds Ray that she’ll be 18 in three years. He thinks she’ll have forgotten all about him by then.\n\nMr. Butler suddenly arrives, and Ray rushes Zoe into a cab before he can get too close to her. He throws Mr. Butler off into a pile of trash. When Mr. Butler tries to attack Ray like he did before, Ray tells him that’s not happening again. Zoe’s gone, and if Mr. Butler ever bothers her or Ray again, Ray will use his medical knowledge to mess him up.\n\nNeela and Gallant stay in the apartment they went to see for hours, talking about his desire to return to Iraq. He was originally only going to serve in the Army until med school was paid for, but he’s changed his mind. He felt like he had a purpose in Iraq, like there was clarity there. He can’t abandon the people he left there. “But you can abandon me?” Neela asks. She gets that he feels camaraderie with his fellow soldiers, but he can get that by volunteering at the VA hospital.\n\nGallant tells her that he can’t forget that there’s a war going on. He couldn’t live with himself if he didn’t go back. Neela suggests finding a volunteer position so she can go with him. He says it’s too dangerous. She’s understandably upset that he asked her to marry him and now wants to leave. Gallant says he thought he could make a life with her as a civilian, but he can’t stay in Chicago when he knows what’s going on in Iraq.\n\nHe promises that he loves her, but she thinks if he did, he wouldn’t leave. He replies that if she loved him, she would understand that he has to. Neela says that could be the problem – she doesn’t know him that well. Hmmm, you mean getting married when you were barely even dating wasn’t the great decision you thought it would be? No way!\n\nThoughts: Show, stop bringing Penny back. No one cares about Penny. Where’s Jane? Bring her back instead.\n\nDubenko has better bedside manner than most surgeons we see on this show, but he’s absolutely not a good fit for emergency medicine.\n\nHearing people call Gallant “Michael” or “Mike” is so weird. It’s like when people call Carter “John.”"
