And he came over to our table, where my family were all sitting, to tell stories.\n\n“I remember I stopped talking and just was staring at him and thinking, ‘What is happening? God, if I died right now … I’d die so happy’.”\n\nParminder went on to call the actor “such a gentleman”, and joked one her friends thought they'd stumbled into \"a twilight zone\".\n\nShe adding: “So lovely. My good friend arrived a bit later and came over and George Clooney was sitting at our table chatting away.\n\n“I think my friend thought he was in a twilight zone.”\n\nParminder played Dr. Neela Rasgotra in the hit medical drama from 2003 until 2009.\n\nGeorge rose to fame as Dr. Doug Ross in the show, starring from 1994 until 1999 before leaving to pursue a career in films.\n\nHe returned to the series in the sixth series for a cameo appearance and his character came back once again to appear in the last ever episode which was broadcast in 2009."
