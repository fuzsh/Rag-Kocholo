        "text": "[ Luka leans up against his car at the motel, Sam is getting ice from the ice machine. ]\n\nLuka:\n\n[ sighs ] What are you doing, Sam?\n\nSam :\n\nThis is what I do, you know that. I don't stay in one place that long.\n\nLuka:\n\nHow long are you going to keep doing that?\n\nSam :\n\nAs long as I have to.\n\nLuka:\n\nYou can't keep running away.\n\nSam :\n\nSure I can.\n\nLuka:\n\nThis isn't just about Steve.\n\nSam :\n\nSorry, sometimes there's a little collateral damage. I have to do this for Alex.\n\nLuka:\n\nFrom what I can tell, it's not working for him.\n\nSam :\n\nYeah well, he's 10, he doesn't know what's working for him.\n\nLuka:\n\nIs this the life you want for him? For yourself?\n\nSam :\n\n[ opens her mouth as if to say something, but is speechless ] I don't know what else to do.\n\nLuka:\n\nGo to your car and follow me back to Chicago. You don't have to do this alone, I'm here, you can trust me.\n\n[ A tear runs down Sam's cheek. Luka pushes her hair back and caresses her face with his hand. ]\n\nSam :\n\nThat's not something I'm good at.\n\nLuka:\n\nWhy not give it a try? It can't be any worse than this, can it?\n\n[ They both smile and softly laugh ]\n\n[ Luka wakes up, turns to see that Sam is not there and gets out of bed. We then see Sam at the open window. Luka comes out of the room and hugs her. ]\n\nLuka:\n\nYou're not sleepy? You will get cold like that.\n\nSam :\n\nHe'll come back [ Sam moves away from Luka. ] We won't have any idea when. Sleeping in one morning or on our way home from a movie, and he'll just show up.\n\nLuka:\n\nWe'll deal with that.\n\nSam :\n\nI don't know why you would want to.\n\n[ Sam looks into Alex's room where he is sleeping ]\n\nLuka:\n\nI can think of a reason. [ Luka closes the window. ] This place is too small. You should both come and live with me.\n\nSam :\n\nWhat?\n\nLuka:\n\nMy apartment has two floors. Alex can sleep downstairs.\n\nSam :\n\nLuka! If we all move in together it is going to be because it is something we all want, not because you think we need to be protected!\n\nLuka:\n\nHey.\n\n[ Sam walks away and mumbles something about a shower. ]\n\nLuka:\n\nHey! [[[w:Samantha Taggart|Sam]] stops and turns and Luka picks up the frying pan. ] Scrambled or fried?\n\nSam :\n\nPoached!\n\nLuka:\n\nPoached??\n\n[ Cut to Sam sorting supplies in an empty trauma room. Luka enters ]\n\nLuka:\n\nThe detective is still here.\n\nSam :\n\nYou shouldn't have been so dismissive of me in front of him.\n\nLuka:\n\nYou didn't need to discuss the details of Louise's condition. She deserves some privacy.\n\nSam :\n\nYeah, and she deserves a chance to help. We have an option we haven't even talked about.\n\nLuka:\n\nAnd that is?\n\nSam :\n\nIf we deflate the crike balloon Louise could wisper.\n\nLuka:\n\nYou want to take her off the vent?\n\nSam :\n\nJust for a few moments at a time.\n\nLuka:\n\nShe is requiring 100% oxygen\n\nSam :\n\nI take her off the vent every time I suction her and she's fine. Come on, we both know it's possible.\n\nLuka:\n\nTechnically, yes, but why risk it?\n\nSam :\n\nBecause she wants to help.\n\nLuka:\n\nShe does or you do?\n\nSam :\n\nWhat is that supposed to mean?\n\nLuka:\n\n[ a beat, softer ] You're sensitive about these kinds of cases.\n\nSam :\n\nWhat?\n\nLuka:\n\nYou always want to stand up for women who've been assaulted.\n\nSam :\n\nAnd you don't?\n\nLuka:\n\nOf course I do. Maybe because of when you were with Steve?\n\nSam :\n\nSteve never raped me.\n\nLuka:\n\nPhysical abuse? Hitting you?\n\nSam :\n\nOh, this has nothing to do with that.\n\nLuka:\n\nAre you sure?\n\nSam :\n\nYeah. There's a violent rapist out there. How are you going to feel in two days, two weeks, a month from now when we get another woman like Louise in here.\n\n[ Malik comes in and says:\n\nHey, crit's only 19 on your GI bleeder.Luka gives a nod to Malik ]\n\nSam :\n\nGo. Go.\n\n[ Luka leaves. ]\n\nLuka:\n\nI thought they would have taken her by now.\n\nSam :\n\nMorgue's backed up. Cororner's backed up. Same 'ol, same 'ol. I thought you were with that (some medical term) kid.\n\nLuka:\n\nPeds surgery took him up to the OR.\n\n[ Sam starts to cry ]\n\nLuka:\n\nSam, you don't need to do this.\n\nSam :\n\nI know.\n\nLuka:\n\nThere are other nurses.\n\nSam :\n\nI know.\n\nLuka:\n\nSam.\n\nSam :\n\nI shouldn't have done it.\n\nLuka:\n\nThe contusions were severe. She could have died anyway.\n\n'Sam :\n\nI shouldn't have done it, Luka.\n\nLuka:\n\nYou did what you did to help the patient, Sam.\n\n[ Pause ]\n\nLuka:\n\nSam?\n\nSam :\n\nWhen I deflated the balloon Louise was still so traumatized. He kept asking her all these questions and the only thing that she could remember wasâ€¦.. white guy, dark hair.\n\n[ Luka walks up to Sam, standing behind her. ]\n\nSam :\n\nI did what I did for \"white guy, dark hair.\"\n\nSam :\n\nHe to young to go, and shouldn't even be listening to that kind of music anyways.\n\nLuka:\n\nI did't know you already said no.\n\nSam :\n\nLuca, I'm trying to teach him the value of a dollar and you go and give him everything that he wants.\n\nLuka:\n\nIt was only fifty bucks.\n\nSam :\n\nFor a concert ticket for a ten year old, NO. That's ridiculous.\n\nLuka:\n\nI just don't think you should be worried about money so much.\n\nSam :\n\nLook, I appreciate your generosity, but I am not going to let you start paying for everything.\n\nLuka:\n\nBut you don't have to pay exactly half the rent and half the bills every month, that's ridiculous.\n\nSam :\n\nYou know I've been taking care of me and Alex for 10 years on my own, I think I can handle it.\n\nLuka:\n\nYou know, this isn't about money at all. You're worried about losing your independence or something. And about my role in Alex's live. What are you worried you're losing control or something.\n\nSam :\n\nYou know what, you always do this.\n\nLuka:\n\nDo what?\n\nSam :\n\nThis! Telling me what I'm really mad about.\n\nLuka:\n\nMost of the time you don't know what you're really mad about.\n\n[ Sam walks to the door ]\n\nLuka:\n\nSam, this isn't our stop\n\nSam :\n\nYou're really good at teaching other people how to communicate.\n\nLuka:\n\nThanks\n\nSam :\n\nWe shoud try it ourselves sometime.\n\nLuka:\n\nYeah.\n\n[ Silence, Luka gets a smirk on his face and tilts his head down to her a bit. ]\n\nLuka:\n\nBut my English, you know? I still need to work on it.\n\nSam :\n\nAw, you're pulling the Croatian card? That's low!\n\n[ She hits him gently and he pulls her into an embrace, hard. He looks down at her adoringly and she returns the look. ]\n\nLuka:\n\nYou were right about one thing.\n\nSam :\n\nOnly one thing?\n\nLuka:\n\n$50 is too much for a concert ticket.\n\n[ She watches him as he comes in for a kiss. It's romantic as the camera pulls away and the show ends on them on the El kissing. ]\n\nCarter (to Wendell):\n\nLook, I'm sorry.\n\nWendell:\n\nWho was it?\n\nCarter:\n\nIt was stupid, it was rude and I'm sorry. Can we go back inside please?\n\nWendell:\n\nIs this a little diversion for you until she comes back to the States?\n\nCarter:\n\nIt's freezing out here.\n\nWendell:\n\nGo back inside, John.\n\nCarter:\n\nHey, hey, I had a baby with her. What am I supposed to do? Cut her out of my life completely because I'm with you now?\n\nWendell:\n\nAre you with me?\n\nCarter:\n\nCan we just please go back inside? Don't, come on, don't walk away! OK, so that's it. One phone call and you're gone, huh?\n\nWendell:\n\nOne phone call? You were in bed with me, John. You could have mentioned that, somewhere between \"how are you\" and \"how's the weather.\"\n\nCarter:\n\nLook, we spend every night together, we enjoy each others company, we have fun. Alright. I know what you want me to say, and....and I can't say it, OK? I'm sorry.\n\nWendell:\n\nWell, at least you're honest.\n\nCarter:\n\nLook, it doesn't mean that we can't...\n\nWendell:\n\nYeah, it does. (walks away)\n\nCarter:\n\n(sighs) Wendell!\n\n(As Steve and Luka are fighting & Alex comes out with his bags packed)\n\nAlex:\n\nLuka!\n\nSteve:\n\nIt's nothing, kiddo. Just a little disagreement.\n\nLuka (to Alex) What's all that for?\n\nAlex:\n\nWe're going to Florida. My dad's got a place by the beach where we can watch the whales migrate. Mom said it was OK.\n\nLuka:\n\nAlex, go back up!\n\nAlex:\n\nNo!!!\n\nLuka:\n\nAlex, now!!!\n\nSteve:\n\nEasy, Hoss. Not your kid!\n\nLuka:\n\nListen. You can take what you want, I don't care, but he's not going anywhere with you.\n\nCarter (to Abby):\n\nWhen I was a student on my surgical rotation, Rubadoux's wife was very sick. She was part of this research study. When her results, uh... when she was no longer useful, there was a lot of pressure to get her out. So I did. I dumped her into a nursing home.\n\nAbby:\n\nDid she belong in one?\n\nCarter:\n\nWe all figured she'd end up back in the hospital which would be on Medicine's shoulders, not ours.\n\nAbby:\n\nSo...? Surgery dumps another patient on Medicine. Happens every day.\n\nCarter:\n\nI told Rubadoux that she was going to get better, told him that her situation was going to improve, told him what he wanted to hear... you know, when you're a student, you're so desperate for approval. You want everybody to like you: you want your patients to like you, you want their families to like you. Gotta be efficient too, though. You gotta impress your superiors.\n\nAbby:\n\nYeah, you don't have to tell me. I'm still on the bottom rung of the ladder.\n\nCarter:\n\nI mean, when the Chief of Surgery tells you to get rid of her, you get rid of her.\n\nAbby:\n\nYeah.\n\nCarter:\n\nAnd then she came back three days later, and she died and Rubadoux was so surprised. Ultimately it was the Attending's fault. It wasn't my responsibility.\n\nLuka:\n\nOK, listen up! OK, first of all, you should all eat and drink well, because the party's on Weaver.\n\nCarter:\n\nThat is a surprise.\n\nLuka:\n\nYou guys who are still on duty, don't let me see a beer in your hand.\n\nPratt:\n\nEleven years, couldn't we spring for some caviar for the man?\n\nLuka:\n\nAnyway, ah, there's something my father would say when a friend went on a journey. And, he said it to me when I came to the United States first. So I thought of it today when I realized I wouldn't be working with this guy anymore. Not for a long time at least. Ah... my father would clasp the persons hand and say: We only part to meet again."
