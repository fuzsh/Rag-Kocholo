The 37-year-old actress, who went on to star in long-running US television series ER, lived with James Stenson for six years, marrying in January 2009. She filed for divorce in February 2012.

Stenson claimed that he stopped working as a photographer which he said earned him $300,000 a year to manage the couple's life after she won the role of Dr Neela Rasgotra on the NBC show in 2003.

He claimed that she channelled money through a company that she controlled, Keep it Real Inc., and bought three homes during their premarital relationship, and asked for $500,000 in damages plus half the value of the properties.

The lawsuit was filed last June in Los Angeles Superior Court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The couple had a son, born in May 2009, a few months after they married.

Nagra, who was born in Leicester and whose mother worked in a factory, played Jesminder "Jess" Kaur Bhamra in Bend it Like Beckham, about a Sikh teenager who rebels against her parents' ban on her playing football.

She co-starred in the film with Keira Knightley. She recalled once: "I met somebody at a party and they were like, 'Which one of the two girls were you?' I said, 'I was the brown one!'"
