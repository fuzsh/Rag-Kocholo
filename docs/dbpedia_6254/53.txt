Meaning and history

A classic example of a wordmark-based emblem, the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball logo still does contain pictorial symbols giving a visual clue to the field the organization works in.

The largest elements on the logo are the block capitals “CAN” (in red) and “AM” (in blue). You can see the full name of the association below, in semi-transparent grey letters, which are, unfortunately, hardly legible at smaller sizes.

Over the letters, three symbols are placed: a maple leaf as a symbol of Canada, a baseball, and a star moving up to the sky.
