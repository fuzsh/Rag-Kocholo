The 26-man roster includes the main group of players who actively participate in games throughout most of the season. On the other hand, the 40-man roster is broader and includes the 26-man roster plus additional players under major league contracts. These extra players could be minor leaguers or individuals on the injured list. Members of the 40-man roster are eligible to be “called up” to the 26-man roster as needed. Furthermore, starting in September, the rules relax a bit, allowing any of the players from the 40-man roster to be active in games, effectively expanding the main roster temporarily.\n\nBaseball Rules\n\nHere are some basic MLB (Major League Baseball) rules explained:\n\nThe Game’s Goal: The main aim is to score more runs than the other team. A run is scored when a player hits the ball and runs around four bases to reach home plate.\n\nTeams and Turns: There are two teams. One team bats, trying to score runs, while the other team fields and tries to stop them. They switch roles after the batting team has three outs.\n\nHitting and Running: The batting team tries to hit the ball thrown by the pitcher from the fielding team. If the batter hits the ball, they run to as many bases as they can before the ball is returned.\n\nGetting Outs: The fielding team tries to get the batting team’s players out by catching the ball before it touches the ground, tagging runners with the ball before they reach a base, or throwing the ball to a base before the runner gets there.\n\nInnings: The game is divided into nine parts called innings. Each team gets to bat once in each inning. The team with the most runs at the end wins.\n\nStrikes and Balls: A strike is when the batter misses the ball or hits it out of the play area. A ball is when the pitch is outside the strike zone, and the batter doesn’t swing. Three strikes and the batter is out; four balls and the batter walks to first base.\n\nHome Runs: If the batter hits the ball out of the field in fair territory, it’s a home run, and they can walk around the bases to score a run, along with any team members already on bases.\n\nFun Facts about MLB Teams\n\nDifferent Colors: Each MLB team has its own special colors and designs for their uniforms. Some teams’ colors are really bright and easy to see!\n\nOld Teams: The Atlanta Braves are the oldest continuously playing team in professional American sports. They started playing way back in 1871.\n\nBig Hits: The New York Yankees have won the most World Series championships. They have won 27 times, which is a lot more than any other team.\n\nLong Games: Baseball games can last a long time, but one game between the Boston Red Sox and the Brooklyn Robins in 1920 was super long. It took 26 innings! That’s like playing almost three regular games back to back.\n\nFlying Far: In baseball, when someone hits the ball really hard, it can go very far. The longest home run ever hit went over 575 feet. That’s almost as long as two football fields.\n\nMLB Teams – List of Baseball Teams, Stats and Upcoming Events – FAQs\n\nAre there 32 MLB teams?\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays joined the league for a $130 million expansion fee as MLB’s 29th and 30th teams. More than a quarter-century later, MLB remains a 30-team league.\n\nWhat’s the newest MLB team?\n\nArizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Rays (then Tampa Bay Devil Rays) were the most recent expansion teams in the MLB. Both of them joined MLB in 1998.\n\nWhat is the oldest team in MLB?\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are the oldest continually operating team in Major League Baseball; enfranchised in 1871 as the Boston Red Stockings (or Red Caps) in National Association, and with connections to the original independent professional Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869–70; joined National League as charter member.\n\nHow many games in baseball?\n\nThe Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six months – a total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason.\n\nHow many innings are in baseball?\n\nIn each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense. A full baseball game is typically scheduled for nine innings, while softball games consist of seven innings, although this may be shortened due to weather or extended if the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings.\n\nWhat is the difference between NL and Al?\n\nThe only big difference between the National League and the American League (AL) was that the AL used the “Designated Hitter” (or DH). The Designated Hitter is a player who does not play in the field, but is used to bat for the pitcher."
