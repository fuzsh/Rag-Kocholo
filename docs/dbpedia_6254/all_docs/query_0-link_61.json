        "text": "The World Baseball Classic is underway and thanks to an improbable upset win over Korea by Israel, the drama was ratcheted up early.\n\nCanada has yet to enter the fray, so it’s time to size up the plucky team that’s looking to surprise traditional superpowers like the United States and the Dominican Republic in Miami. Here’s a look what kind of firepower the Canucks are bringing to the big tournament:\n\nThe Big Star\n\nThere’s no two ways about it: Canada is missing its biggest names. Joey Votto is giving the WBC a miss to perfect his already-immaculate swing. Russell Martin was held out due to an insurance snafu, and Michael Saunders has elected to prioritize integrating into a new team.\n\nOn the pitching side, the squad is without veteran reliever John Axford, up-and-coming starter James Paxton, and sophomore stud Jameson Taillon, who wore the red and white in 2013.\n\nNo one player can adequately compensate for all those absences, but Canada has its foundational star in Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman. The 27-year-old slugger is a two-time All-Star coming off a season where he hit .302/.400/.569 with a career-best 34 home runs and posted the highest Wins Above Replacement total among first baseman at 6.1.\n\nIf Canada is going to get anything done at the WBC it will need a little magic from Freeman, but that’s certainly possible as he’s one of the biggest offensive threats in the tournament.\n\nThe Old Men\n\nThis is a squad that could be considered battle-tested or overcooked depending on your point of view.\n\nTwo of Canada’s top pitchers – Eric Gagne and Ryan Dempster – have 26 seasons of MLB experience between them with five All-Star appearances. On the other hand, the duo has walked the earth for a combined eight decades and neither has pitched in the majors since 2013. Former Toronto Blue Jay Scott Richmond could be seeing some important innings at age 37 and top closer candidate Jim Henderson is 34.\n\nWhen it comes to position players, Justin Morneau (35) and Pan Am Games hero Pete Orr (37) figure prominently into the team’s plans, as does grizzled veteran George Kottaras (33), who is the club’s primary option behind the plate.\n\nCanada brings a group that won’t be shaken by the magnitude of the event, but it’s certainly worth asking what a large percentage of this roster has left to offer at the highest level.\n\nThe Young Guns\n\nWhile the Canucks are undoubtedly bringing a veteran outfit to Miami, there are certainly some intriguing young players in the mix.\n\nSeattle Mariners prospect Tyler O’Neill has immense power potential having hit 59 home runs in his last two seasons in the minor leagues. The 21-year-old still has plenty of swing-and-miss in his game, but he refined his approach significantly in 2016 by cutting down on strikeouts and taking more free passes – causing him to shoot up to Number 38 on Baseball America’s Top 100 prospect list. Although O’Neill may struggle with some of the advanced breaking stuff he sees at the WBC, he could certainly run into a fastball or two and help Canada score in bunches.\n\nThe Canucks can tap into another impressive supply of raw power in the form of Josh Naylor. While Naylor is only 19 years old, he’s a prodigious talent who became the highest-drafted Canadian position player of all time in 2015 when he was selected 12th by the Miami Marlins. The Mississauga Ont. native has since been shipped to the San Diego Padres who coveted his sweet left-handed swing. Look for Naylor to come off the bench with men on base when Canada could use an extra-base hit.\n\nNot all of the team’s youngsters are mashers – Canada is also bringing Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Dalton Pompey. It may seem to Blue Jays fans that Pompey has been around forever, but the 24-year-old is still in the process of converting his impressive tools into consistent production. His long-term outlook remains hazy, but in the interim Canada can count on the centre fielder to provide a dash of speed and run down some balls in the gaps.\n\nOverall Outlook\n\nUltimately, there’s no way around the fact that Canada is a heavy underdog to make any noise at the WBC. To advance past the pool stage the team needs to finish ahead of either the United States or the Dominican Republic – a tall task even for a squad at full strength.\n\nWith a laundry list of notable absences, Canada will be counting on veteran guile on the mound and youthful enthusiasm at the plate. Success with that formula is far from impossible. That said, to say its improbable might even be an understatement.\n\nIn that sense Canada is playing with house money. Any success will be a pleasant surprise, and if the Canucks make an early exit, it’s hard to be disappointed. If nothing else, watching the mix of nostalgia-inducing veterans and possible future stars should be a treat for the fans at home."
