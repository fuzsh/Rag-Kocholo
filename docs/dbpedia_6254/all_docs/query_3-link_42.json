        "text": "Our office, our sport and our world lost a great, kind and empathetic person yesterday. Billy Bean was the kind of leader every industry needs. How fortunate are we that he was one of ours! Billy was generous with his time, helping his colleagues navigate both personal and professional challenges. No topic was too small or too large for Billy to offer his help. He cared about all those around him, and he made everyone feel heard, acknowledged and appreciated. He was so much more than an advocate of the LGBTQ+ community. He worked tirelessly to make EVERYONE feel like they belonged in our sport - whether you were a fan, a player, a coach, or if you worked in some capacity in the game. Regardless of anyone's beliefs or opinions, he always wanted to find the common ground, the foundation, that we all love our game. More than anything, he wanted to make sure that our youngest generation never felt less than or were made to feel like they didn't belong in their communities, their schools, or in our game. Simply put: he helped us be better. The impact and legacy he leaves in baseball and the larger sporting community will live on. As Commissioner Manfred stated, our hearts are broken. He meant so much to so many. We will miss him every day. Commissioner of Baseball Robert D. Manfred, Jr. said: “Our hearts are broken today as we mourn our dear friend and colleague, Billy Bean, one of the kindest and most respected individuals I have ever known. Billy was a friend to countless people across our game, and he made a difference through his constant dedication to others. He made Baseball a better institution, both on and off the field, by the power of his example, his empathy, his communication skills, his deep relationships inside and outside our sport, and his commitment to doing the right thing. We are forever grateful for the enduring impact that Billy made on the game he loved, and we will never forget him. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Billy’s husband, Greg Baker, and their entire family.”"
