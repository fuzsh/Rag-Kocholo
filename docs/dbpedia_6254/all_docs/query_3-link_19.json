        "text": "Watch every game live or on-demand in the American Association of Professional Baseball (AAPB), the premier MLB Partner league in the United States and Canada!\n\nBaseball fans will enjoy the high level of play during 600 regular season games over a five-month season, along with the AAPB Postseason and All-Star games. Choose between home and away announcers in broadcasts that are streamed in HD.\n\nThe American Association of Professional Baseball was formed in 2006 and is based in the heart of America and southern Canada. The following clubs make up the 12-team league: Chicago Dogs (IL), Cleburne Railroaders (TX), Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks (ND), Gary SouthShore RailCats (IN), Kane County Cougars (IL), Kansas City Monarchs (KS), Lake Country Dockhounds (WI), Lincoln Saltdogs (NE), Milwaukee Milkmen (WI), Sioux City Explorers (IA), Sioux Falls Canaries (SD), and Winnipeg Goldeyes (MB).\n\nTo access all features and content, you can subscribe to American Association TV on a monthly or yearly basis with an auto-renewing subscription right inside the app*. Pricing can vary by region and will be confirmed before purchase in the app. In-app subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of their cycle.\n\n*All payments will be paid through your iTunes Account and may be managed under Account Settings after the initial payment. Subscription payments will automatically renew unless deactivated at least 24-hours before the end of the current cycle. Your account will be charged for renewal at least 24-hours prior to the end of the current cycle. Any unused portion of your free trial will be forfeited upon payment. Cancellations are incurred by disabling auto-renewal.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.aabaseball.tv/tos\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.aabaseball.tv/privacy\n\nTruth Moose ,\n\nFANtastic\n\nI am a fan of the Sioux City Explorers. When I canât attend the games, I love to watch them play on this app.\n\nI also enjoy watching the other teams in this league. They are very competitive, and this is great baseball to watch.\n\nThe announcers are all very good, and the players are extremely talented. I would rather watch this league play than watch a major league game. This is pure baseball without the woke B.S. And it is great value for the money.\n\nI attended the Sioux City - Kansas City playoff game last night, and I was using the app to watch replays of some exciting moments on the field, some fans around me, also were amazed at the quality of the video,\n\nThereâs no place that I know of that you can get this much value for so little money. Keep up the good work AA baseball, I love it. Long live Americaâs pastime!"
