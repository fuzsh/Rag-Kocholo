        "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia — So maybe this is why so many Minor League Baseball teams have left Canada.\n\nI had come to this mountain-rimmed metropolis to watch baseball with the locals. This was the second game of the season for the Class A Canadians, part of the Toronto Blue Jays farm system and the last Canadian minor league team affiliated with Major League Baseball.\n\nAs the nighttime temperature plummeted — 50 degrees Fahrenheit to 45, to near 40 — my wool coat stood up to the cold about as well as a wet paper towel. I tried to take notes, but my fingers were too frosty to move.\n\nThere wasn’t much to note, as the home team lost to rival Tri-City, 9-1, in front of 1,500 fans on hand at little Nat Bailey Stadium."
