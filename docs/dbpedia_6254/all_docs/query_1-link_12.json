During his playing days at GSU, Cooper was twice named second team all-conference and following his senior campaign received First-Team All-SWAC honors.\n\nCooper was a 33rd round draft pick to the Houston Astros organization. Cooper followed up his playing career at Grambling with a brief stint in the Houston Astros organization, before playing a year with the Sussex Skyhawks in the CanAm League. Cooper is also the last player drafted that was coached by the Grambling Hall of Fame Legend Coach Wilbert Ellis. Cooper says “there’s no way I can thank Coach Ellis enough for the significant role he played into developing me as a young man, baseball player, and coach.”\n\nNotable draft picks and MLB affiliations under Cooper’s helm:\n\nJeremy Shelby OF 38th round Baltimore Orioles\n\nEldred Barnett OF 29th round San Francisco Giants\n\nChris Wolfe SS 30th round Oakland A’s\n\nCory Jordan RHP 35th round Tampa Bay Rays\n\nEdwin Drexler OF 38th round Los Angeles Dodgers 2015\n\nTanner Raiburn LHP 33rd round Boston Red Sox 2017\n\nJohan Mojica C FA sign w/ Milwaukee Brewers 2017\n\nTorreon Woods MLB scout w/ Oakland A’s (currently Chicago White Sox) 2018\n\nMarshawn Taylor SS 28th round Arizona Diamondbacks 2018\n\nAngel Peguero Development Coach Philadelphia Phillies 2019\n\nTeam USA Baseball:\n\nIn the summer of 2018 Cooper had been selected as an assistant coach for the 16U Team USA Baseball division, where he had the opportunity to coach and mentor some of best 15 and 16 year old baseball players in the country. Later that year, he was also invited to the Team USA Baseball winter camp for the 18U division that was held at TCU.
