        "text": "CCBC Rules and Procedures\n\nThe CCBC, a division of the Premier Baseball Association, is an independent college baseball league that is affiliated with institutions from The BC College Athletic Association and educational institutions from Alberta. The Board of Directors of the CCBC recognizes that academic achievement is critically important to the student athletes, the baseball programs, and the respective university or college. Athletes must realize they are a student first and then a baseball player as referenced by student-athlete. The following rules are the minimum eligibility standards. They apply to all CCBC programs and are to be strictly adhered to.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nFall Season – September 1 - October 31 of the calendar year\n\nSpring Season or Championship Season – January 1 - May 31\n\nFull Time Student – a student that is enrolled in at least nine credits; Note: a “full load” is 15 credits.\n\nPractice Player – a player not enrolled in at least 9 credit hours or is deemed ineligible in the Championship Season.\n\nFirst year student – a student attending a post-secondary institution for the first time.\n\nEligibility Rules:\n\n1. The minimum player fee charged by each team for a full year shall be $2000.00.\n\n2. Student athletes should be encouraged to enroll in at least twelve credits. In order to participate in any fall/spring game or scrimmage, a student athlete must be enrolled at the respective institution as a full time student at the time of that game or scrimmage. This includes games or scrimmages against any other institution or program of any kind, in Canada, or in the United States.\n\n3. In order to be eligible for the Championship Season a student athlete must have passed at least nine credits between Championship Seasons.\n\nHe also must be deemed eligible by his Athletic Director or, in the event that an Athletic Director is not in place, by a third party as designated by the CCBC.\n\nException: a first-year college student that is attending school in the fall as a full-time student will be deemed eligible for the subsequent Championship Season if he receives passing grades in courses that total only six credits.\n\nNote: A player returning to the CCBC from another institution is not considered a first-year student unless he has only attended school for one semester or quarter, as might be the case at the school he is leaving. He must have passed at least six credit hours at that school. Enrolment payment receipts and a copy of previous semester grades should be submitted with the fall and spring rosters.\n\n4. Student athletes should be encouraged to enroll in the fall of the school year. A student-athlete who enrolls in school for the first time in January is eligible for the Championship Season. He must also be designated as eligible by the Athletic Director or, in the event that an Athletic Director is not in place, by a third party as designated by the CCBC. Players who wish to change programs must get a release or sit out a year.\n\nNote: In order for this athlete to be eligible for participation in the CCBC Championship Season in his second year of eligibility, he must pass at least fifteen credit hours before that spring season begins. Nine of which must be in the fall semester. For example, a student athlete cannot attend school in the spring semesters only and still maintain eligibility. Summer school credits can be used for fall eligibility. A student enrolled as a full time student in a Trades Program is eligible for the baseball program. The Athletic Director will rule on any questions of eligibility.\n\n5. Practice players may participate in practice sessions and inter-squad games but are not permitted to participate in any team activities, including team travel. Note: in order for a player to practice with a program, appropriate liability insurance must be in place for that player and his participation in practice sessions must be approved by the Athletic Director or, in the event that an Athletic Director is not in place, by a third party as designated by the CCBC.\n\n6. Student athletes are allowed four years of athletic eligibility. All Championship Seasons that a player has participated in while attending any post secondary institution will be considered one year of eligibility towards his four years. No maximum for academic studies; a player could get a second degree and play baseball. Eligibility regarding professional players: A player must cease to play professional baseball to initiate eligibility. For every year of professional baseball a player loses one year eligibility in the CCBC; total eligibility in CCBC is 4 years. A player with one or more years of professional baseball must complete two academic sessions before eligibility will be considered; the league academic eligibility requirements for playing baseball must be met. A player drafted out of high school and released prior to July 31st is eligible to play fall ball in September of that year.\n\n7. Any other eligibility requirements are to be determined by the Athletic Directors at the institution where the student-athlete attends. .\n\n8. A team may redshirt a player as a regular or medical redshirt (2011-05-14). A player not on the spring championship team roster is considered a regular redshirt and is eligible to play the following season. A medical redshirt player must meet the following conditions: provide a doctor’s certificate; positional players who have not played more than 3 league games; a pitcher cannot be red shirted after a team has played 8 league games.\n\n9. Teams may use players from other schools in their area; a number of teams already have players from other schools\n\n10. Transfer policy: once a student athlete joins a CCBC team and pays his registration fee, he will then be considered to be rostered with that team. If a rostered player wishes to transfer to another CCBC program, they must: request a release from the current CCBC team in writing (via email) stating the reason for requesting a transfer; meet with the coach of their current CCBC team to discuss the transfer request; the CCBC team will have 7 days to reply to the transfer request; if the transfer request is given, the student athlete may then apply to any other CCBC program; if the transfer is denied, then the student athlete must either play for the existing program or not participate in any program (sit out) for one championship season; after sitting out for a championship season, the player would be deemed to be a free agent and he would be able to approach another CCBC program; sitting out implies that the student athlete cannot work out with, practice, or play exhibition games with another CCBC program\n\nPlaying Rules:\n\n1. Rosters for the Fall Season must be submitted with practice players designated by the September 15th of the fall semester Previous semester grades and fall enrolment receipts should be available, if requested Only players on the roster by the deadline are eligible to play exhibition or league games.\n\n2.

All double headers will consist of a seven inning game and a nine inning game.\n\nThe seven inning game will be the first game of the day. If the seven inning game goes into extra innings, the game now becomes the nine inning game and played to completion; second game is now the seven inning game. Start times are 1:00pm on Saturday and 11:00am on Sunday. With mutual agreement teams can play two nine inning games on Saturday and two seven inning games on Sunday to help teams with travel. Teams will request this format by the Wednesday prior to the weekend games Teams will contact their umpires to run this format for approval and effective communication.\n\n5.

Ejections: Umpires have the authority to eject a player, coach or team representative for misconduct or unsportsmanlike conduct. The offending individual must leave the field and dugout area immediately and are not allowed to communicate with the teams or umpires.\n\nAny very offensive ejections will be reviewed by the BCPBL discipline committee and further discipline may be assigned by the committee. The 1+1 ejection rule for players will take effect in 2011 for league games only. A player ejected from a league game must sit out the next league game; an exhibition game does not count as a game sat out.\n\n8. Pre-Game Practice: If the home team takes batting practice on the playing field or in cages before any game, the visiting team must be offered the same opportunity, unless declined in advance. Following the home team practice, thirty minutes must be provided for the visiting team (1 hour and 10 minutes before game time). Infield practice for both teams should follow (home team first) and be limited to 10 minutes per team. This will allow approximately 15 minutes for field preparation. If the home team does not take pre-game batting practice or infield practice, they can designate that the visiting team has no on-field pre-game practice as well. Off site (a different field) practice does not apply to this courtesy. If the visiting team does not wish to take pre-game batting practice, they should notify the home team well in advance.\n\n9. League Schedule: All games must be played. There will be a $500/game assessment to teams for not playing all their games on their league schedule and the team will be ineligible for the post season championship the following year. This rule will only comes into play when a team refuse to complete their schedule; a conference call will be requested to resolve this situation A team that travels to play their games will not have to return to play these games; if possible these games should be made up by attaching them to another trip. Situations that come up regarding the rescheduling of games should be resolved by the teams involved. Games late in the season affected by weather may not be able to be made up. For league play there will be one (1) division of five (5) teams. A 28 game schedule starting the third (3rd) weekend in March was adopted as the starting date for league play each season. No changes to the schedule shall be made after schedule is ratified.\n\n10. In the event after the completion of league play there is a tie in the standings between teams, the following criteria will be used to break the tie.
