There you can find most of the video content we produce. However, we also believe that fans that visit our site deserve more. For that reason this section exists. Here you will find all our video content, including YouTube videos and bonus non-YouTube content.\n\nindy ball out takes- general admission\n\nUploaded November 17, 2019\n\nAudio from Episode XXXVII (37) 'Disposing of Mr.Bee' of the Indy Ball Report.\n\nThe first episode of the new series. Sometimes we go off the rails on funny and entertaining rants, that really don't fit in with flow of the show. So we are forced to cut them. However, you shouldn't be penalized for that. You can now see these out takes here, in our new series \"Indy Ball Out Takes\".\n\nThis episode we look at the guys longing for General Admission and why he is so important to baseball as a sport. Enjoy!\n\nIntro Music- Mozart- Requiem\n\nVideo Clips From\n\nSomerset Patriots (Twitter)\n\nSomerset Patriots (YouTube)\n\nGeneral Admission (Twitter"
