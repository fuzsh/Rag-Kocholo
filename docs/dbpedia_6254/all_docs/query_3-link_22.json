        "text": "The American Association\n\nYour Monarchs play in the American Association of Professional Baseball, an MLB Partner League. The league’s 12 teams are not directly affiliated with MLB organizations, which means winning games for their fans is their top priority.\n\nFounded in 2006, the American Association has established itself as the premier MLB Partner League in North America. The Association has an extensive geographic reach, stretching from Canada to Chicago to Texas.\n\nThe league is split into two divisions (East and West) of six teams each. The Monarchs play in the West division. The regular season lasts 100 games, starting in mid-May and ending on Labor Day. The top four teams from each division at the end of the regular season advance to the playoffs.\n\nThe first two rounds of the playoffs are best-of-three series, with one team from each division advancing to the best-of-five Miles Wolff Cup Finals. The winner of that series is crowned league champion.\n\nThe Monarchs organization has won three American Association championships. The club’s most recent title came in 2023, in manager Joe Calfapietra’s sixth season."
