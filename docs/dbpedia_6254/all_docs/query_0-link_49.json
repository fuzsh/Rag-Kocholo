        "text": "RIP to Ed Ott, the catcher for the World Champion Pirates in 1979. He spent more than 40 years in professional baseball as a player, coach and minor-league manager. He died on March 3, in Danville, PA, at 72 years old. Ott played for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1974-1980) and California Angels (1981) and coached with the Houston Astros and Detroit Tigers.\n\nNathan Edward Ott was born in Muncy, PA, on July 11, 1951. He was a good baseball player from an early age and played in the Pennsylvania East-West All-Star Game, which pitted players from the Western, or Pittsburgh, side of the state against the best from the East, or the Philadelphia side. However, Muncy High School did not have a baseball team, so all of his baseball playing was done in Babe Ruth leagues and the like. He was a four-year letterman in football and wrestling in high school. In his junior and senior years, Ott was the leading scorer in the West Branch Conference, with 21 touchdowns and 23 extra points for 149 total points in 1969. Ott was also the runner-up for the state’s Wrestling Senior of the Year in 1970. Those high school sports did some damage to Ott’s knees, but the Pittsburgh Pirates decided to draft him in the 23rd Round of the 1970 June Amateur Draft. He was also chased by college football powerhouses like Penn State or Nebraska, but baseball was his favorite sport.\n\nOtt had been a third baseman, but Pittsburgh converted him to an outfielder and assigned to the Niagara Falls Pirates of the New York-Penn League for the remainder of 1970. He hit .291 in 61 games and ended up as the team’s Most Valuable Player. He didn’t hit any home runs, but he made up for it with 10 homers in 1971 with Monroe. Ott, a left-handed hitter, spent a total of three seasons in Class-A ball and hit in the .290s or .300s, with decent power potential. In those first three seasons in the low minors, Ott played the outfield exclusively. He had a cannon for an arm and routinely earned double-digit outfield assist totals. His bat remained a valuable tool, with batting averages in the .260s, and he hit 14 home runs for the Charlies in ’74. That same year, Ott got his first promotion to the majors to replace Parker, who had injured his hamstring. Parker at that stage of his career was a backup outfielder, and Ott shared the same role. Ott debuted on June 10 as a defensive replacement for Willie Stargell in a game against the Padres. In 2 innings, he caught a fly ball hit by Willie McCovey. It was the only fielding chance he’d get with the Bucs that year. Ott was hitless in 5 pinch-hit at-bats and pinch-ran for Zisk against San Francisco on June 15. He scored the winning run a Rennie Stennett triple.\n\nOtt was in a bad position — literally. He had become a dependable hitter, but he was no more than a fair outfielder, despite the great arm. He led the International League with 21 outfield assists in 1974, but he wasn’t speedy and committed more errors than is desirable for an outfielders. Furthermore, the Pirates had Dave Parker, Richie Zisk and Al Oliver in the outfield and prospects Miguel Dilone, Tony Armas, and Omar Moreno making their way through the minors. Ott caught a part of one game for Charleston in 1973 and played a few games at third base in 1974 as the organization tried to figure out what to do with him. In 1975, the organization decided to utilize Ott’s cannon of an arm and make him a full-time catcher. The results for that first year were predictable. Ott committed 20 errors behind the plate and allowed 23 passed balls. On the bright side, the switch didn’t affect his hitting at all. He hit .285, drove in 55 runs and homered 10 times for Charleston. A game on April 15 against Pawtucket encapsulated Ott’s season. He drove in 5 runs with 2 homers, a triple and a single. However, he also threw wildly to first base in the ninth inning to let the winning run score. The transition to catcher was judged successful enough that Ott made the International League All-Star Team, and he was brought back to the Pirates in September. His time was limited to 5 games, with 5 at-bats and 5 innings behind the plate. Aside from one passed ball, he fielded well, and he delivered his first major-league hit against St. Louis pitcher Ron Reed on September 28.\n\nOtt was not consulted when the Pirates decided to make him an outfielder, but he went along with it. “I didn’t really bother me. I figured they’d made the right decision,” he said in a 1976 interview. He approached the move to catcher in much the same way. “I thought it might take 2-3 years to make the adjustment,” he said, but he came around even quicker than that. “I went into it with an open mind and everything just fell into place.”\n\nOtt spent all of 1976 with Pittsburgh. He was the third-string catcher behind Manny Sanguillen and Duffy Dyer and a left-handed pinch-hitter. He didn’t start a game until late September, when the team’s other catchers were benched with injuries. He made his first career start on September 23 against the Cubs and had 2 hits, including a game-winning double off Darold Knowles — the first lefty he’d ever faced in the majors. He also made an outstanding catch of a badly thrown relay throw to nail baserunner Jerry Tabb. The latter play was the one that really impressed manager Danny Murtaugh. “He’s fighting to get a job behind two pretty good ballplayers, he got a chance to play and it looks like he intends to make the most of it,” he said.\n\nPittsburgh traded Sanguillen to Oakland in the offseason for a new manager, Chuck Tanner, leaving Dyer and Ott to share the catching duties. Ott spent the offseason playing in the Dominican Republic and had to leave early because of knee injuries. When he got back, a doctor diagnosed him with arthritis, five or six bone spurs and some torn tissue. “But he said it’s nothing serious,” Ott added. He played in 104 games and slashed .264/.334/.395 in his first real extended playing time in the majors. He hit 14 doubles, 3 triples and 7 home runs… and a fight that ended Felix Milan’s career.\n\nThe Pirates and New York Mets played a doubleheader on August 12, 1977. The Pirates swept, but the real story was an incident in the sixth inning of the second game. With a runner on second, Ott was intentionally walked to set up the double play. Mario Mendoza grounded to shortstop Bud Harrelson, who flipped the ball to second baseman Milan for the force play, but Ott slid hard into second base to stop the double play. Milan was enraged, and when Ott stood up, the second baseman slugged him in the face with his right hand, which still held the baseball. Ott, the former letterman wrestler, picked Milan up and power-slammed him onto the infield. Ott was ejected, and Milan was carried off the field on a stretcher with a broken collarbone and separated shoulder. He never played again in the majors, though he played in Japan and Mexico for a few more years. Ott received a fine for his actions, but the normally easy-going Tanner felt that Ott was justified in his actions. “He got everything he deserved,” Tanner said of Milan. Even the closest people to the play at second base — Harrelson and umpire Jerry Dale — denied that it was a cheap shot by Ott to break up the play.\n\nIf the play had happened today, it would have spread on social media instantly, and Ott would most likely have gotten a lengthy suspension (and probably a pro wrestling contract). But the catcher missed no playing time and apologized for the fight… sort of. “I apologize to him for hurting him as bad as I did,” he said. “I wanted to hurt him, but not nearly that bad. I just wanted him to remember, ‘Don’t hit Ed Ott in the face again on a double play.'”\n\nThe funny thing about the play was that it made Ott seem like a hot-tempered bad guy, and he wasn’t like that at all. He was easy-going off the field and helped keep a clubhouse loose, and he came to regret the fight with Milan. “I’m not proud of that. I lived with that for a few years,” he said in a 1981 interview. “People gave me the reputation of being a bad guy, and I’m not. I wasn’t proud of that one bit.”\n\nOtt remained the primary catcher for the Pirates through 1980, sharing time with capable backups like Dyer and Steve Nicosia. Tanner was a big believer in platoons, so Ott primarily played against right-handed pitchers. He was remarkably consistent over that span, batting between .260 (1980) and .273 (1979). He hit between 7 and 9 home runs, 14 and 20 doubles and drove in between 38 and 51 runs. He played defense as well as catchers with years more experience, and he was pretty close to league average when it came to throwing out baserunners. He was never an All-Star, but he was among the most dependable catchers in the league.\n\nOtt could also step up and take a leadership role on a team with strong personalities. In late 1978, Pittsburgh was fighting to keep its playoff hopes alive, and Ott called a team meeting before an important doubleheader against Philadelphia. “A couple of days ago we had a couple of guys — I’m not going to mention names — that didn’t run ground balls out. There was 25,000 people here and 25,000 booed me. Hell, I booed myself. I’m not that type of ballplayer. I said to myself, to my teammates, it’ll never happen again,” he explained. Several other Pirates stepped up after Ott said his piece, and then the team won both games on walkoffs. Ott scored the winning run in the first game with a ninth-inning triple before dashing home on a throwing error by center fielder Garry Maddox.\n\nThe Pirates finally finished first in the NL East in 1979 and went on to defeat Baltimore to win the World Series. Ott batted .273 and set career highs in doubles (20), hits (110), RBIs (51) and runs scored (49). He didn’t like being one of Tanner’s “Platoon Pirates,” but like the others in his situation — John Milner and Lee Lacy — he accepted it. Nicosia hit .288 with 4 homers during the season, so the Pirates got great production from the catcher position all season long. Ott played all 3 games of the sweep of the Cincinnati Reds in the NL Championship Series, with 3 hits in 13 at-bats. He played in 4 games of the 7-game World Series and had 4 hits for a .333 batting average, 3 RBIs and 2 runs scored. He singled off Don Stanhouse in the ninth inning of Game Two and came around to score the winning run on a single from the re-acquired Sanguillen, for a 3-2 win.\n\nOtt’s final season with the Pirates was productive as usual — a .260 batting average, 8 home runs, 41 RBIs. That September, though, the Pirates recalled a new catching prospect, Tony Pena, and it was clear that the team saw him as the catcher of the future. A trade had to be made to give Pena a chance to play regularly, and Pittsburgh pulled the trigger on a deal with the California Angels on April 1, 1980. Ott and pitcher Mickey Mahler were sent to the Angels for first baseman Jason Thompson. “I was surprised, but happy as hell,” Ott said of the deal. “I’ve said for years if I was traded I’d like to go to one of two teams — the California Angels or the Houston Astros. Both are contenders with good guys.”\n\nThe year, though, didn’t go the way Ott had intended. The Angels were managed by a former teammate, Jim Fregosi, and that was one of the reasons Ott favored the team. Then Fregosi was fired and replaced by Gene Mauch, who was another platoon-oriented manager. Ott played in 75 games in the strike-shortened season and hit a career-worst .217 with just 2 home runs. He became a free agent at the end of the season, which at the time was part of a “re-entry draft.” He re-signed with California, who reached the 1982 ALCS before losing to Milwaukee. But he was never a part of the success. Three days before the season started, Ott tore the rotator cuff in his right shoulder while throwing out a baserunner in a spring training game against the White Sox. “When I released the ball it felt like my arm went with it, and I felt a big tear in my shoulder,” he said. Ott hoped to get back to the Angels before the end of the season, but he never made it back to the majors. He made 2 rehab appearances in the Angels minor leagues in 1983, reinjured his arm and underwent another surgery. He made it into 14 games for Triple-A Edmonton in 1984 as a player-coach and hit well, but with the odds of him returning to the majors as a players were slim, he decided to stick to the coaching side. That November, he was named the manager of the Prince William Pirates, Pittsburgh’s team in the Class-A Carolina League.\n\nOtt played in parts of 8 seasons in the majors and had a .259/.311/.368 slash line. His 465 career hits included 76 doubles, 10 triples and 33 home runs. He drove in 195 runs and scored 196 times. Baseball Reference credits him with 5.9 Wins Above Replacement.\n\nOtt spent a couple of decades as a coach and manager in organized baseball. That first team he managed, the Prince William Pirates, had youngsters like Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla and John Smiley on it. At the onset of his coaching career, Ott said his main goal wasn’t to reach the majors as a manager or win lots of championships. His goal was to be like his father, Howard. “He brought baseball to our hometown,” Ed said of his father. “Our family didn’t often have two coins to rub against each other but, when we did, my dad would go and buy some baseball equipment and round up a team. He loved to work with children. He was always looking to help a kid improve his skills and he dreamed of one day seeing one of his pupils make it to the big leagues.\n\n“I want to get a reputation for being able to work with young ballplayers; to help them improve their offensive, defensive and mental abilities; to increase their playing years. I have an opportunity now to work with so many kids and I want to make sure I do my job.”\n\nOtt’s dedication to his coaching eventually brought him back to the major leagues. Art Howe, a former Pirate teammate, named Ott as his bullpen coach/catching instructor when he began managing the Astros in 1989. Ott also had to take up the role of enforcer when brawls broke out, such as the one between the Astros and Reds in June of 1992. Ott said that he saw Reds reliever Rob Dibble choking Astros catcher Scott Servais, so he trapped Dibble in a sleeper hold. “I watched him turn red, I watched him turn purple, I watched him turn blue, then I let him up,” Ott explained. “I could have given it another 45 seconds and watched him turn black but I let up. Now maybe he’ll value life.”\n\nHowe and his coaching staff were dismissed after the 1993 season. Ott sent some time working on his second love — being an outdoorsman — by working at the Buffalo Creek Sporting Club in Bedford County, VA. He got back into baseball by becoming the “first” manager of the Allentown Ambassadors of the new Northeast League in 1997. Technically, Ken Oberkfell was the first manager, but he left after a month for a job in the Phillies organization. Ott was the first Allentown manager who actually managed a game. But he quarreled regularly with the umpiring crews and piled up a large number of ejections. Eventually the team’s owner, Peter Karoly, suspended him indefinitely in the middle of a playoff series in 1999 for “language and threatening conduct;” Ott resigned instead. He was still named Manager of the Year in 1999, winning the award for the second season in a row. After a year away from the game, Ott joined the coaching staff of another old teammate — Phil Garner — when Garner was named manager of the Detroit Tigers. They were dismissed in 2003 along with Garner, but just months later, a new opportunity arose: Allentown asked him to return. The Ambassadors had fallen into last place of the Northern League East (it’s new affiliation), and Karoly fired manager Darrell Evans before turning back to Ott.\n\n“We’ve had our differences of opinion, but I like Ed, and he’s the brightest baseball man I know,” Karoly said of his returning manager. “And he’s the only person I felt who could fix things here.” Ott stayed with the team for the rest of 2003 and 2004, when Karoly announced the team was folding due to financial losses.\n\nOtt returned home to the Dallas area, where his second wife, Sue, was a show-horse trainer, but another former associate persuaded him to return to baseball. Ott’s first coach with the Ambassadors, John Calfapietra, had become the manager of the Jersey City Jackals of the Canadian-American League, and he asked Ott to serve as the team’s hitting instructor and third base coach in 2007. Aside from spending 2010 as a manager for the Can-Am League’s Sussex Skyhawks, Ott coached for the Jackals through the 2013 season, his 42nd and final season in professional baseball.\n\nFollow me on Instagram: @rip_mlb\n\nFollow me on Facebook: ripbaseball\n\nFollow me on Bluesky: @ripmlb\n\nFollow me on Threads: @rip_mlb"
