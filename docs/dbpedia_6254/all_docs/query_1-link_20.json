The Ottawa Champions will not field a team in the Frontier Lg in 2021, although the Frontier Lg did not rule out a Champions return in 2021.\n\nOf specific interest to me, the New Britain Bees will not be one of the teams in the 14-team Frontier Lg that will play in 2020. The Can-Am Lg was thought to be a possible destination for the Bees.\n\nThat leaves the Bees staying in the Atlantic Lg at least one more season, or becoming a collegiate summer league team in either the FCBL or NECBL. I guess it’s also possible that the Bees could join the Empire Professional Baseball Lg, but the Empire Lg is essentially the lowest run of pro ball, and I don’t see that being likely. Maybe there is some other possibility that I am not aware of? Probably not, but we’ll see.\n\nI’m sad to see the Can-Am League go. We’ve gone to 15-20 Can-Am Lg games over the years. My first-ever pro game foul ball snag was at a Sussex Skyhawks game about 15 years ago.\n\nWe scored dugout lineup cards from four of the Can-Am Lg teams, and an official batting order card from another.\n\nOttawa Champions lineup card from 2015; I like the watermark!\n\nWhile it is far more rare that Can-Am players made it to MLB compared to the Atlantic League, Stephen Cardullo of the Rockland Boulders, in the 3-spot in Rockland’s lineup above, played for the Rockies in 2016-2017.\n\nKate and I went to our one and only Frontier Lg game in 2017, scoring Frontier Lg 25th anniversary baseballs and lineup cards from the Florence Freedom and now-defunct Normal Cornbelters.\n\nIt’s nice that we’ll be able to chase more Frontier Lg lineup cards if we want. Three of the teams — Rockland, New Jersey and Sussex — are all about 2 hours from us.\n\nMeanwhile, we’ll continue to wait to see what happens with the Bees.\n\nThey’ve been playing professional baseball in New Britain, CT since 1983. But how much longer will it last?\n\nAn article last week, based on multiple anonymous sources, said that the New Britain Bees are unlikely to be part of the independent Atlantic League in 2020.\n\nAnother article suggested that the Bees, who are contractually committed to New Britain Stadium in 2020, could be headed to the Can-Am League, a lower level, cheaper-to-operate independent league.\n\nYet another reporter tweeted a quote on October 4 from a Can-Am League exec saying there were no plans to add the Bees in 2020 or beyond.\n\nPer their Twitter account, the Bees have simply said:\n\nThe New Britain Bees are looking forward to another great season of baseball @NBStadium in 2020. Stay tuned to http://nbbees.com and look out for our 2020 schedule which will be announced shortly!\n\nMy Take\n\nThe rumors aren’t shocking given that the Bees have struggled to draw in their four years in New Britain, and were last in the league in attendance the last two years.\n\nWe’ve gone to some 35 Bees games the last four years. I’ve noted on several occasions how empty the park has been, outside of the handful of school/camp day games a season.\n\nThere have been a lot of empty seats at Bees games, including this 2019 game\n\nAccording to the Atlantic League, the team drew an average of just over 2,000 fans per game in 2019, although I think that number is inflated based on what I’ve seen.\n\nIt would seem like the options for 2020 are:\n\nAtlantic League\n\nCan-Am League\n\nFutures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL) (a college summer league)\n\nOther (including not playing)\n\nIf you hold a gun to my head, I’ll say that the Bees play in the FCBL next season. Based on the fan support, that’s probably where they belong.\n\nThat said, I’d prefer to have them stay in the Atlantic League, even if just for one more season until Gastonia, NC joins in 2021.\n\nIf not the Atlantic League, my second choice would be the Can-Am League. It is cheaper to operate a Can-Am League team with fewer games and less expensive players, but I’m not sure New Britain can pull the numbers to do even that.\n\nThe FCBL, or perhaps the New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL), may be the best fit attendance-wise. And you don’t pay the players, which is a significant savings. But it would mean that professional baseball in New Britain is over.\n\nAnd that would be sad.\n\nNew Britain Stadium is where we’ve gotten about 25% of our lineup card collection.\n\nLineup card from the first New Britain Bees’ victory in 2016\n\nWe already have lineup cards from most Can-Am League teams, but have not gotten a Can-Am League lineup card in a couple years, so it would be fun to try and get those in 2020.\n\nAll FCBL and NECBL teams, to the best of my knowledge, use a generic league lineup card. They’re nice enough, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to get them.\n\nNECBL Lineup card\n\nFCBL lineup cards\n\nAs leagues need to finalize their 2020 schedules pretty soon so they can start marketing, it should be just a matter of days before we see where the Bees end up (or where they don’t end up).\n\nOne of our goals this season was to get at least one other international lineup card. Last season, we got a neat lineup card from the Ottawa Champions of the Can-Am League.\n\nA Japanese All Star Team from the Shikoku Island League Plus All Star Team and the Cuban National team are both playing series against each of the Can-Am League teams. It seemed like a great opportunity to get an international lineup card!\n\nI did some research on the Sikoku Island team, and it unfortunately appeared that they used a white board for their lineup card. Therefore, I wouldn’t have made the 4-hour round trip to see them play other than that it worked out for me to be in the area otherwise to see them play the New Jersey Jackals.\n\nThe good news was that Shikoku Island did not appear to be using a white board for its lineup card. The bad news is that I couldn’t see ANY lineup card in the Shikoku Island dugout.\n\nThe Jackals did have a lineup card in their dugout. I was able to get that after the game.\n\nWe got another Jackals lineup card last season, and this was the same as that: very plain looking.\n\nI then headed over to the Shikoku Island dugout with nothing to lose. After the manager, Terushi Nakajima, was interviewed by a Japanese journalist, I showed him the Jackals lineup card and asked if he had one. He nodded as though to say yes, which at least momentarily made me think I had struck gold. But when he kept walking past me, I realized something had been lost in translation.\n\nNakajima and all of the Shikoku Island players lined up along the concourse to sign autographs. It was pretty neat to see. I had Nakajima sign the lineup card (in the “Pitchers” section in the pic above.\n\nI had no idea who Nakajima was. It turns out, he played on Japan’s 1988 Olympic baseball team and then played eight seasons in the Nippon Pro Baseball League.\n\nOne other highlight was that the teams got together for a group picture after the game.\n\nFor what it’s worth, even though I would have preferred to get a lineup card from the Shikoku Island team, I do count Shikoku Island as one of the leagues we have a lineup card from as we have them on the Jackals card. The same situation happened last season when we were not able to get the Fargo-Morehead RedHawks (American Association) lineup card when they played the Sussex Miners, but did get the Miners lineup card for that game.\n\nThere will still be opportunities to try and get another international lineup card before the end of the season, including the Cuban national Team’s games against local Can-Am League teams later this month.\n\n2016: 25 lineup cards (20 dugout/bullpen; 5 “official batting order”)\n\nLifetime: 88 lineup cards (67 dugout/bullpen; 19 “official batting order”; and 2 “relief pitcher usage”)\n\nLeagues: MLB: American League; National League. MiLB: International League; Eastern League; Carolina League; New York-Penn League. Independent Leagues: Atlantic League; Can-Am League; American Association. Colleges: NCAA – American Athletic Conference; NCAA – Ivy League; NCAA – Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference; NCAA – Northeast Conference; Cape Cod League; New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL); Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL); Cal Ripken Summer Collegiate League"
