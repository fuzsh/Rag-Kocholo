        "text": "The Frontier League, the longest-running independent league in professional baseball, announced Wednesday it will merge with the Can-Am League for the 2020 season.\n\nIt will create North America's largest league in independent baseball as five Can-Am teams join nine from the Frontier League, including the Evansville Otters, who will remain the oldest franchise.\n\nThe league will continue to be called the Frontier League.\n\n\"For those of us who have been in this business for a long time, to see where this thing can go, we're so excited for the future,\" Frontier League commissioner Bill Lee said during a news conference, noting discussions had been ongoing for two years.\n\n\"Bringing the 14 teams from basically the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, we want to make sure this thing can grow and watch our industry grow with it.\"\n\nThere will be two divisions. One will be called the Cam-Am Division, which will include its legacy members in the New Jersey Jackals, Quebec Capitales, Rockland Boulders, Sussex County Miners and Trois-Rivieres Aigles as well as the Washington Wild Things and Lake Erie Crushers.\n\nThe Midwestern Division will then include the Evansville Otters, Florence Freedom, Gateway Grizzlies, Joliet Slammers, Schaumburg Boomers, Southern Illinois Miners and the Windy City ThunderBolts.\n\nThe Frontier League has never had more than 14 active teams since it was established in 1993.\n\nEvansville Otters President John Stanley is part of the Frontier League’s executive board of directors and was involved with the discussions and decision to make the merger happen.\n\nThe catalyst in this merger was this past summer's joint Frontier League/Can-Am League All-Star Game in Pomona, New York.\n\n“Everybody wants to be a part of something that is growing and special, and the Frontier League has that,” Stanley said in a release. “The merger allows the business side to reach new markets, interests and opportunities. There’s prospective growth in a lot of different areas.”\n\nEach team will play a 96-game schedule from May 14 until Labor Day weekend. Everyone will play 12 games against five teams, six games against four teams and three games against three others.\n\nThe schedule will be revealed on Monday.\n\n“This bodes well for the future of professional baseball in Evansville,\" Otters owner Bill Bussing said in a release. \"We’ll still play 48 home games each year, but fans should enjoy seeing five new opponents.”\n\nThe Can-Am League, or the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, was created when the Northeast League was renamed in 2005 and featured just six teams this past season. One, the Ottawa Champions, will not be part of the Frontier League merger because its lease for the 2020 season had expired.\n\nThe Frontier League's River City Rascals also have left independent pro baseball to instead be a summer college wooden bat team.\n\nLeague markets now include the metropolitan areas St. Louis, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, plus Québec City and Montreal in Canada. It's unclear to what effect travel costs will impact teams' already limited budgets, though.\n\n\"We’re the biggest, the best and the brightest independent league in the country right now,\" said Al Dorso, Can-Am League Chairman of the Board. \"Everyone in every market should know that and in two years, we’ll be a 20-team league. That’s our vision and the Frontier League’s vision.”\n\nSalary caps and age limits have yet to be determined, Lee said. He also said the playoff format is not set in stone but that the top two teams from each division will likely continue to qualify.\n\nOtters manager Andy McCauley has familiarity with the teams and competition being introduced to the Frontier League, as he was the manager of the Québec Capitales in 2002.\n\n“I’m really excited about the news and excited to have an opportunity to return to those cities in the Northeast,” McCauley said. “I enjoyed my time there in the Can-Am, and I can’t wait to get the season going and welcome those five teams to Bosse Field.”\n\nAs Dorso and Lee each alluded to, the Frontier League will look at expansion opportunities in future seasons, including in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\n\nIndependent leagues are not affiliated with Major League Baseball or their minor leagues. The rights to players who excel in the Frontier League and others are generally sold to MLB clubs. Over time, 38 Frontier League players and 16 Can-Am League players have reached the MLB.\n\nThe 2020 season certainly will have a different feel when fans at Bosse Field see the Canadian flag flying next to the American flag and also hear Canada’s national anthem when the Canadian teams visit."
