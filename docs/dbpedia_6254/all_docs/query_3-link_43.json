        "text": "Story Highlights\n\nGray Television announces an agreement to bring select American Association of Professional Baseball (AAPB) games to free, over-the-air local television stations in multiple Midwestern markets and across three of Gray’s local sports networks: Arizona Family Sports in Arizona, Peachtree Sports Network in Georgia, and Silver State Sports and Entertainment Network in Nevada. The AAPB is a Professional Partner League of Major League Baseball.\n\nIn particular, Gray intends to air the AAPB All-Star Game over-the-air across more than a dozen markets on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. In addition to a “Game of the Week” format on Gray’s owned over-the-air sports networks, Gray’s television stations in Mankato, MN, Rockford, IL, Sioux Falls, SD, and Cedar Rapids, IA plan to carry games from AAPB teams located in or near those markets.\n\n“Gray is committed to live sports,” says Sandy Breland, Gray’s Chief Operating Officer. “This agreement provides another example ways we are providing viewers what they want with live sports.”"
