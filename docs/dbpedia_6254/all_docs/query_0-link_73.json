        "text": "1999-2001 New Jersey Cardinals - Fresh Fitted Friday!!!!\n\nThe landing gear is about to come down on the New York-Penn league festivities and I'm making sure the last few Fresh Fitted Friday selections are super special, starting with this week's New Jersey Cardinals cap that I believe to be from 1999 to 2001.\n\nThe New Jersey Cardinals played in the NYPL from 1994 (in which they won the League Title) through 2005 and wore this cap logo for parts of the 1997 season and then all the way through their final season.\n\nI've identified the sweatband tags as being similar to ones I've seen on the following caps from 1999-2001: Augusta GreenJackets, Harrisburg Senators and Trenton Thunder.\n\nSecond week in a row with a cap featuring a bred MILB batterman! Also of note is all of the aforementioned caps also feature \"The Nation's Highest Quality Fitted Cap\" verbiage on the satin taping inside the crown.\n\nThe 12 seasons the Cardinals played in Augusta, NJ isn't long when compared to stalwart cities of the league such as Auburn, Batavia and Jamestown but it was a decent run considering they shattered NYPL league attendance records, all while posting losing records year after year, besides of course the lone League Title in their first season.\n\nAfter the Cardinals relocated to State College, PA their ballpark was home to a couple of Can-Am League teams: Sussex Skyhawks from 2006 to 2010 and the Sussex County Miners from 2015 to present.\n\nAt 7 1/8, this cap is too small for me so I'm putting it on the Trading Block. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you want this or any other cap from that list and you are willing to part with any of the hats on my Wish List.\n\nAs always, thanks for coming back to read about baseball hat geekery. I've got comments disabled here so if you'd like to discuss a trade or simply just chat about hats, please feel free to connect via the following social sites:\n\nInstagram: @baseballmilquetoast\n\nTwitter: @FittedFriday\n\nLabels"
