        "text": "OTTAWA, ON – They are not scheduled to play for several more months, but the Ottawa Professional Baseball Club is already engaging fans as part of a “Name the Team” contest.\n\nFans may submit their ideas at www.ottawaprofessionalbaseball.com. The individual providing the winning entry will receive a prize and be recognized on the field during the Ottawa Professional Baseball Club’s 2021 home opener at Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Park.\n\nEntries will be accepted until October 28th, 2020. Bilingual submissions are highly-encouraged.\n\n“We look forward to hearing everyone’s ideas, and are excited to include the community in our building process,” said Regan Katz, Vice President of the Ottawa Professional Baseball Club. “We are open to suggestions from all categories, whether it be wildlife, history, culture, or culinary. Ultimately, we just want the name to be fun, and one that represents our mission to offer affordable, family-friendly entertainment.”\n\nPrevious Ottawa-based professional baseball teams have included names such as the Giants, Athletics, Lynx, Rapidz, and Champions.\n\nFounded in September 2020, the Ottawa Professional Baseball Club is the newest member of the 15-team, independent Frontier League. The ownership group is led by Sam Katz of the Winnipeg Goldeyes (American Association) and Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group (OSEG) of the Ottawa Redblacks (Canadian Football League) and Ottawa 67’s (Ontario Hockey League).\n\nThe Ottawa Professional Baseball Club and the rest of the Frontier League are scheduled to begin play in May of 2021."
