Joining the Frontier League (whose commissioner is Bill Lee, not to be confused with former Major Leaguer Spaceman Bill Lee) appears to be a good fit geographically, philosophically and timing-wise – playing a season that begins in May and runs into early September.\n\n“It was logical, it was the perfect fit and we’ve now been officially approved,” said Katz. “For nearly 30 years, the Frontier League has helped set the bar for independent baseball, and we are proud to become a part of its rich history.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Ottawa team hopes to have a manager in place within the next 30-60 days.\n\n“I’ve talked to a few potential candidates,” said Katz. “We’re going to be moving pretty quick on that. I think we have a good shot of getting a top-notch manager for the new Ottawa franchise.”\n\nBeing in a league with Quebec City and Trois Rivieres is a chance to renew a rivalry. The Ottawa Champions, who were denied entry into the Frontier League for the 2020 season, played alongside the Capitales and Aigles in the Can-Am League from 2015-19.\n\n“The addition of Ottawa is great news for Québec and Trois-Rivieres,” said Michel Laplante, president of the Capitales. “Not only do we benefit from having a team in our area, but we believe this strong ownership will make the Ottawa market successful and attractive for the possible expansion into greater Montreal.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThere will be a Name the Team contest launched in the coming weeks.\n\n“COVID-19 has made it challenging, we were hoping to get out there and do a lot of stuff. Now we have to do it all remotely,” said Katz. “The Name the Team contest will be one of the No. 1 priorities. (Champions) is a name we will stay far, far, far away from – no interest.”\n\nFounded for the 1993 season, the Frontier League is the largest and longest-running independent professional baseball league. The league has teams with home bases from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River and from the Ohio River to the St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nIt was also announced Friday Major League Baseball has named both the American Association and the Frontier League as “Partner Leagues” of MLB. The Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB) was designated a Partner League earlier this week. As Partner Leagues, the Frontier League and the American Association will collaborate with MLB on initiatives to provide organized baseball to communities throughout the United States and Canada. The Frontier League annually moves the most players into Major League Baseball organizations of any of the independent leagues.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“It’s very exciting,” said Katz. “But so everybody understands – even though we are partners with Major League Baseball and there are a lot of exciting benefits, we’re still always going to be autonomous. That’s the important thing. You know how affiliated works – they tell you who to play, etc., etc. We will make sure every day our manager puts out the best players to win every single game.”\n\nThe lease between Katz and the city begins Jan. 1. The annual lease payment to the city is $125,000 (plus H.S.T.) per year for base rent, payable in six monthly instalments beginning next May 1 and continuing until Oct 1 and each subsequent year of the ease. The city has also placed a Municipal Capital Facility Agreement designation on the stadium which exempts it from municipal taxes. Katz has accepted the Ottawa Baseball Stadium on an “as is” basis, with no additional maintenance or investment from the city. He has also agreed to pay the $473,000 arrears owed by the Champions.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGetting fan support is always a challenge. When the Ottawa Lynx joined the International League (Triple A) in 1993, the franchise was hugely successful, with many sellouts. But by the time they departed in 2007, though, fan interest had dropped off sharply. In the wake of the Lynx came the Rapidz (2008), the Voyageurs (they never played a game before folding in 2009), the Fat Cats (2010-2012) and the Champions.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nThe Senators didn't approach Anderson about being a rental at the trade deadline\n\nBREAKING: The Ottawa Senators are going to say goodbye to winger Bobby Ryan\n\nGARRIOCH: Craig Anderson is ready for the next chapter as he leaves the Ottawa Senators\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
