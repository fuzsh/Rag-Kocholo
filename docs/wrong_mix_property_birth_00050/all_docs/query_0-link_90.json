        "text": "Music mogul Dr. Dre is giving back to his hometown of Compton, Calif., by donating $10 million to help build a performing arts center for Compton High School.\n\nKABC-TV reports that the center will include a 1,200-seat theater and will be part of a new high school facility that is expected to break ground in 2020.\n\nâ€œMy goal is to provide kids with the kind of tools and learning they deserve,\" says Dre. \"The performing arts center will be a place for young people to be creative in a way that will help further their education and positively define their future.\"\n\nThe total cost of the entire high school project is expected to reach nearly $200 million, the district says.\n\n\"The Compton Unified School District is pleased to partner with Dr. Dre to provide a state-of-the-art performing arts complex for students and members of the community,\" says Compton Superintendent Darin Brawley says in a news release. \"We are looking forward to blending both his vision and that of the district to provide opportunities for individuals to both explore and apply their creativity in the arts.\"\n\nDr. Dre - born Andre Young - grew up in Compton and first rose to fame as a member of the rap group NWA, whose debut album was titled \"Straight Outta Compton.\"\n\nHe later found success as a solo artist, producer and businessman. His most lucrative move was launching the headphone brand Beats by Dr. Dre in 2008 - which was acquired by Apple in 2014 for $3 billion.\n\nThe architect for the high school and the performing arts center is DLR Group.\n\nVideo from KABC-TV:"
