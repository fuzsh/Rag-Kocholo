        "text": "In 2009, the City of Compton (City) received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to replace windows at City Hall to improve energy efficiency. Chattel first conducted a site visit and research, then recommended that the was building eligible for listing on the National Register and helped the City navigate the Section 106 review process. Chattel advised the glazing replacement contractor, and consulted with the U.S. Department of Energy and California Office of Historic Preservation. The work was approved and completed on a tight time frame by the end of 2012.\n\nChattel prepared a determination of eligibility finding the City Hall eligible for listing in the National Register for its design and association with Harold L. Williams, FAIA, prominent local African American architect and civic leader. Chattel worked with the City to find a method of window replacement that would not alter the character-defining features. After exploring a number of glazing alternatives, the project team selected a low-e coated bronze glass that could be installed in the existing steel window frames, making the change almost imperceptible with the least amount of alteration to the existing building.\n\nThe project won a Los Angeles Conservancy Preservation Award in 2013."
