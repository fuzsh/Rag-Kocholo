Eckko can relate to many of the issues and problems faced by the diverse student population because she experienced many of those same problems. Her goal as a counselor and professor at Compton College is to ensure that every student that she has contact with receives a wealth of knowledge in hopes of making more informed decisions regarding their educational and career goals.\n\nAs an EOPS/CARE counselor, she is charged with providing personal counseling, creating abbreviated and comprehensive educational plans, evaluating transcripts for transfer credit, conducting workshops for program probation students, students on academic and progress probation, and students that are new to EOPS/CARE, assisting students with graduation petitions, financial aid appeals, prerequisite clearances, CSU, UC, and private college transfer applications, and petitions to repeat courses. As an EOPS/CARE counselor, it is her duty to disseminate information efficiently and effectively. The information that she shares with students can very well be life changing for some, which is why counseling and teaching motivates her to learn as much as she can to best support her students.\n\nHello and welcome to Compton College!\n\nTheresa Barragan-Echeveria attended CSU Los Angeles where she completed a bachelor's of science in business administration with an emphasis in marketing. Theresa thought she was going to join the corporate world but that did not align well with her personality, values and skills. She values education and realized her passion was working with students! To actualize her career goal she completed a master's degree in educational counseling at the University of La Verne.\n\nShe began her career in higher education in 2006 and since then has championed for student success. At Compton College she can assist students with educational planning, career exploration and connect students with resources to be successful.

Her inspiration to become a counselor began at Golden West College where she was the Honors Program Secretary for nearly seven years. She is passionate about helping students reach their goals and discover their own successful selves. One of her favorite and often used phrases is, \"Onward and Upward.\"\n\nShay has been the Athletics Counselor at Compton College since November 2015.

As a former EOPS student, Liliana is aware of the personal and academic challenges Compton College students experience during their college trajectory. As an EOPS/CARE Counselor, she assists students who are low-income and educationally disadvantage to achieve their academic and professional goals.

She earned her bachelor of science in psychology with an emphasis in clinical/behavioral applications and her master of science in counseling and guidance, pupil personnel services from California Lutheran University.\n\nShe is a proud Latina that is a first-generation college student who came from a low-income family in Lynwood, CA. She was confused and undecided as to her career goals throughout her education and realized she did not want many others to experience the same thing. Her personal experience in having to learn to navigate the higher education system, seeking out resources that she did not know were available to her, having to learn the importance of networking and forming relationships with professors and other staff on a college campus, and feeling uncomfortable with her lack of career and educational goals has had a huge influence in her passion to help all students become prepared to successfully navigate the higher education system. She is proud to be back her community and helping students transition into Compton College and create your success story.\n\nShe likes to spend time with her family and friends, play with her pets, and occasionally play online FPS games.

Carlos is not sure about of the background of his last name, his pops is from Mexico City (his mom is from Ensenada- well Colonia Guerrero really) but it's his mom's last name. A google search will show there are a bunch of Maruris although he never met any other ones in person. He grew up in Chino and moved out to Long Beach after high school to attend CSULB which he failed miserably at his first year. He got a job on campus at the student union that first summer and it changed his trajectory. He finished with a bachelors degree in psychology (he originally entered as a history major) and went on to get a masters degree in counseling with an emphasis in student development in higher education at CSULB as well. He thought he wanted to take his boss' job at the Student Union but he had to do a mini internship his first year of graduate school and he ended up at Compton helping out the First Year Experience program. After that it was a wrap, he knew he had to be at Compton College and a year after completing his masters, he secured a full-time counseling position at Compton College. He is at Compton College to be the person he didn't have while going through college. He didn't go to school to tell you what classes to take, he went to school to be a counselor. He will listen to you, he will try to help you sort out the issues that may be stopping you from being successful in the classroom, he will be part of your support system. He will also help you with your classes . His powers as a counselor only work if you are in front of him though (in person or virtually). He looks forward to working with you!\n\nThis is Melain McIntosh's first year at Compton College and she is excited to be at Compton College!\n\nAs an alumnus of Los Angeles City College (LACC), Melain experienced firsthand the positive impact of a community college education both personally and professionally.

She believes if students receive the right amount of challenge, balanced with support, they will grow and be successful. She affirms the Compton College belief that every student is a success story! She is here to challenge and support you on your journey to academic, personal, and professional success!
