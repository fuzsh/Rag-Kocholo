        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) â Dr. Dre will need to make room in his trophy case for another prestigious award.\n\nThe American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers said on Tuesday that Dr. Dre will receive the first-ever ASCAP Hip-Hop Icon Award. Heâll be honored at the organizationâs Rhythm & Soul Music Awards on Thursday in Los Angeles.\n\nâDr. Dreâs groundbreaking early work laid a foundation for hip-hop as we know it today,â Paul Williams, chairman of the board and president at ASCAP. âAs a champion for some of todayâs biggest artists and a successful entrepreneur, he changed the culture around hip-hop.â\n\nThe honor Dre is receiving will be presented to ASCAP members whose musical contributions have made an âindelible impactâ on the art and culture of hip-hop.\n\nDJ Kid Capri and DJ Drama will provide music for Thursdayâs event, which will celebrate 50 years of hip-hop.\n\nDre, a seven-time Grammy winner, has produced big hits for Jay-Z, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Nas and 50 Cent. He won his first Emmy for last yearâs Super Bowl halftime performance with Eminem, Mary J. Blige, Snoop Dogg, Lamar and 50 Cent.\n\nThe prolific producer emerged from the West Coast gangster rap scene alongside Eazy-E and Ice Cube as part of the group N.W.A., which made a major mark in the hip-hop culture and music industry with controversial lyrics in the late 1980s.\n\nEarlier this year, Dr. Dre celebrated the 30th anniversary of âThe Chronicâ with a re-release of his highly acclaimed debut studio album. In 2010, he was honored with the ASCAPâs Founders Award."
