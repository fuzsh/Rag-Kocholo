        "text": "Background\n\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth was born in Compton, California. to a couple from Chicago. His mother named him after American singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of The Temptations. Lamar grew up around gangs but did not belong to any. He attended McNair Elementary and Vanguard Learning Center. Lamar was quiet and shy. He graduated from Centennial High School in Compton and was a straight-A student. In 2004, Lamar released his first full-length project ― a mixtape titled “Youngest Head Nigga in Charge.” at 16 under the pseudonym ‘K.Dot.’ This garnered local recognition, leading to a recording contract with Top Dawg Entertainment (T.D.E.), an indie record label in Carson, California. Two years later, Lamar released a 26-track mixtape ― “Training Day.” Lamar started gaining recognition after his first retail release, “Overly Dedicated,” in 2010."
