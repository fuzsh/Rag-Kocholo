        "text": "We at Thomas Jefferson Elementary School believe in a rigorous education and are committed to program excellence. We believe excuses perpetuate failure, and work as a team of staff and parents to overcome the challenges we face in a school where all students receive free lunch, and educational resources outside of campus are very limited. Because we serve a high percentage of English Learners, our school focuses on the importance of academic proficiency in English. Teachers collaborate to make the curriculum relevant for students and provide additional tutoring and homework support through Response to Intervention (RTI), Saturday Math Academy, and our After-School Education and Safety Program (ASES). Gifted and Talented Education students also benefit from advanced learning opportunities. The surrounding community expresses love and admiration for their school. Although Jefferson was almost closed in 2011 due to the economic impact of sustaining a school of aging portables, the enormous outcry from the community kept the school open. With the help of the community and the trust parents place in us, we have been able to set the wheels in motion for continued success. We are currently expanding to a K-8 model, and there are many accomplishments that speak for us. We received the 2011 California Association of Bilingual Education Seal of Excellence. Last year we became a California Distinguished School, and received the Title I Academic Achievement Award. We believe the sky has no limits for Jeffersonâ€™s students."
