        "text": "The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers announced Tuesday that it would be presenting artist and producer Dr. Dre with its first-ever Hip-Hop Icon Award. The award honors \"ASCAP members whose musical contributions have made an indelible impact on the art and culture of hip-hop,\" the music licensing group said in a statement.\n\nDr. Dre will be presented with the honor at the ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Music Awards Celebration of 50 Years of Hip-Hop in Los Angeles on Thursday.\n\n\"Dr. Dre's groundbreaking early work laid a foundation for hip-hop as we know it today. As a champion for some of today's biggest artists and a successful entrepreneur, he changed the culture around hip-hop,\" said ASCAP Chairman of the Board and President Paul Williams.\n\nDr. Dre is an eight-time Grammy Award-winning producer and musician, as well as the founder and CEO of record label Aftermath Entertainment and electronics giant Beats Electronics. He also founded Death Row Records, a favorite of West Coast hip-hop legends such as Tupac, MC Hammer and Snoop Dogg, who were on the label's roster in the 90s.\n\nDr. Dre also founded the American hip-hop group N.W.A. in Compton, California, in 1987, but his solo career began five years later with his first album, \"The Chronic\" â€” which is now certified triple platinum.\n\nDr. Dre's production is widely credited with having launched the music careers of hip-hop legends such as 50 Cent, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar, among others.\n\n\"Dre continues to be a pivotal figure in the music industry and we are thrilled to recognize him with the inaugural ASCAP Hip-Hop Icon Award as we mark 50 years of hip-hop,\" said Williams."
