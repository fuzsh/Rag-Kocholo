Thousands of fans lined up outside the Best Buy in Compton to meet the rapper and have their copies of his third studio album, \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" signed.\n\n\"It feels good to be back in my city, to go out here and see these kids still motivated by my music and by my dreams and aspirations,\" Lamar said.\n\nThe two-time Grammy Award winner was born and raised in Compton and had a special message for the fans that have stuck with him through the years:\n\n\"I wanna say thank you. Thank you for believing in me since day one. I've been doing my thing on the underground scene for years, you know, proud to be putting out any albums,\" Lamar said. \"These the same people that have been rocking with me so I want to say thank you for believing in me and I believe in you the same, so as long as we believe in each other, I will continue to do this music.\"\n\n\"To Pimp a Butterfly\" is available now in stores and on iTunes."
