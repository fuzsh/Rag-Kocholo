The program is a 7-year dual-cohort program, which services both the 6th & 7th grade classes at our 4 designated target schools below:\n\n• Roosevelt Middle School\n\n• Whaley Middle School\n\n• Kelly Elementary\n\n• Roosevelt Elementary School\n\nCurrently we service a total of 848- 6th and 7th grade students from the abovementioned target schools. In the near future, our program will service this same cohort of 6th & 7th grade students as they enter Dominguez High School and into their first year of undergraduate education."
