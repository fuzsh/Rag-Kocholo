        "text": "SAN MARTIN — The Frys.com Open just became a little more special for Erik Compton.\n\nThe two-time heart transplant recipient and PGA TOUR member was honored with the inaugural PGA TOUR Courage Award to kick off the tournament at CordeValle Golf Course.\n\n“Erik’s (Compton) story is a remarkable one in the fact that he has overcome extraordinary odds to not only survive, but thrive,” Commissioner Tim Finchem said. “With Erik’s show of perseverance and courage, along with his charitable work to encourage organ donation, he is a very fitting recipient of the inaugural PGA TOUR Courage Award.”\n\nCompton was diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy, a condition that forced him to undergo two heart transplants when he was just 9-years-old, his first being at age 12.\n\nIn 2008, Compton suffered a heart attack that forced the second transplant. With no one around, he had to drive himself to the hospital for treatment.\n\n“Through the help of family, doctors and friends I have gone from being someone lying on his back in recovery to someone walking the fairways of the PGA TOUR,” Compton said. “Not only has playing on TOUR been a dream of mine, but it has also served greatly in the healing process.\n\nSix months after his heart attack in 2008, Compton played and made the cut at the PGA TOUR’s Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals Classic as a Sponsor Exemption.\n\n“It has given me something to work toward, but also something to hope for. I’m incredibly grateful for this award and blessed to have the opportunity to be playing on the PGA TOUR.”\n\nThe Courage Award includes a $25,000 donation to a charity of the winner’s choice. Compton, a Miami native, chose the Cardiovascular Institute of Miami and the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation to receive the donation, sharing it between them.\n\nCompton was the 2011 Mexico Open champion on the Web.com Tour and earned his TOUR card for 2012 after finishing 13th on the season ending money list.\n\nCompton was still making his way through the course Thursday and is currently +3 on the day through 16 holes."
