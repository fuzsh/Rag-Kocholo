        "text": "A dozen Southern California public schools, including two first-time winners in Compton, accepted the most prestigious education award in the country on Tuesday.\n\nThe US Department of Education bestowed the National Blue Ribbon School award to Jefferson Elementary School and Tibby Elementary School in the Compton Unified School District -- the first time any school in Compton has received the award.\n\n\"This is great day for Compton,\" said Micah Ali, the president of the Compton School Board. \"The fact that two Compton schools were honored among only 24 in the state is continuing proof that our emphasis on student success in the Compton School District is paying off.\"\n\nThe elementary schools were two of 337 schools in the country to earn the recognition.\n\n\"Some of us have passed, some of us have went on to other school sites, but we've all been here to support our mission--that all children can learn, that all children deserve a quality education,\" said fourth grade teacher Mary Sitter of Tibby Elementary.\n\nJefferson Elementary Principal Mario Marcos said reaching this point has been about teamwork, focusing on every child and getting them the help they need if they are not performing well.\n\nTalking to parents about the value of education has also been a part of their efforts.\n\nLocal\n\nGet Los Angeles's latest local news on crime, entertainment, weather, schools, COVID, cost of living and more. Here's your go-to source for today's LA news.\n\nWhile Marcos recognizes the incredible honor this award gives to the school, he is careful to see the bigger picture.\n\n\"Praise will make you weaker, but the work continues tomorrow,\" he said. \"Weâ€™ll be back to work tomorrow.\"\n\nThe 10 other Southern California schools who received the National Blue Ribbon School award are Gretchen Whitney High, Rio Vista Elementary, Los Molinos Elementary, Lanai Road Elementary and Wallen L. Andrews Elementary in LA County; Newland (William T.) Elementary, Huntington Seacliff Elementary and Rossmoor Elementary in Orange County; Hillside Elementary in San Bernardino County; and Del Sur Elementary in San Diego County.\n\n\"I commend these amazing schools and their commitment to providing the kind of learning environment in which teachers can excel and students can achieve,\" State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson said in a statement.\n\n\"They have brought out the very best in their students and themselves,\" he said. \"I am proud of their success and hope they relish this moment to shine in the national spotlight.\"\n\nNational Blue Ribbon nominees are selected based on state assessment English-language arts and mathematics scores and the scores of students coming from a disadvantaged background, according to the California Department of Education."
