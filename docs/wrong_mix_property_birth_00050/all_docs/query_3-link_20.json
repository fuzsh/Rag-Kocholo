I am very touched by this recognition and by everyone. Everyone knows this, but it's the 50th anniversary of Hip Hop. Hip Hop came into my life when I was a teenager and for over 40 years I have loved it. What I love most about this award is that my name will inspire them to pursue greatness in the future,\" Dre elaborated\n\nWhile Dr. Dre was giving his speech, attendees could not contain their excitement and clapped and shouted, cheering the Aftermath rapper.\n\nAs you know, Dre's career took off after he signed with the Ruthless Records label and began producing hit records for local rappers Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren and The D.O.C. creating the iconic rap group N.W.A.\n\nHis debut album, \"The Chronic\", was a huge success and made him one of the most successful producers of the hip-hop genre, after almost 8 years he made another classic record called \"The Chronic 2000\".\n\nIn 1996 he founded his own record label, Aftermath Entertainment, and his first solo album, 2001, became one of the best rap albums of all time with one of the best collaborations including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Nate Dogg, Akon, Krupt, and many more.\n\nCelebrating 50 years of Hip Hop\n\nAfter he was presented with the award, the Recording Academy honored the attendees with a 15-minute medley of some of Hip Hop's most iconic songs, including the performances from LL Cool J, The Roots, Run DMC Public Enemy, Method Man, Salt n Peppa, Queen Latifah, Rakeem, Missy Elliot, Busta Rhymes, De La Soul, Big Boy, Nelly, Too Short, Lil Baby, Lil Uzi Vert and more."
