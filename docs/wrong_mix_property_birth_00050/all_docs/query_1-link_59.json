        "meta_description": "About Seasons at Compton features 84 one- and two-bedroom apartments that serve a blend of limited-income seniors, seniors with developmental disabilities, seniors who care for dependents with developmental disabilities, and formerly homeless seniors — one of the few examples of integrating these underserved populations. It is a thoughtful, cutting-edge community with stand-out features to meet",

        "text": "Low-income seniors and adults with developmental disabilities have a lack of access to clean and safe housing, as they typically cannot afford to live in communities such as what Seasons provides. Due to their reliance on Social Security payments, their income forces them to live in neighborhoods that are often dangerous and where specialized programming that these populations require is simply not offered. The Association of Regional Center Agencies estimates that up to 31,000 Californians with developmental disabilities need safe, affordable housing.\n\nSeasons at Compton provides both the privacy and independence of an apartment for developmentally disabled adults as well as the group support of their senior neighbors, Linc staff, and professional on-site case managers. Residents have a wonderful community that helps them to continue living independently and provides a sense of security and wellbeing. The Compton Collaborative — a group of asset managers, property managers, and service providers — meets monthly to identify, discuss, and address emerging issues affecting Seasons at Compton residents.\n\nIn August 2013, Seasons at Compton became the first senior multifamily housing community in Los Angeles County to complete Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training. Through CERT training, a number of residents and staff now understand their role in preparing for a disaster and can lead their neighbors in such an event. Universal and Sustainable Design principles have been incorporated throughout the community to provide a beautiful, highly functional environment, while emphasizing energy efficiency, use of natural light and ventilation, and small carbon footprint. The building is certified LEED Platinum. Universal Design ensures accessibility and includes wider doorways and hallways, adjustable height counters, lower light switches, ramps, and elevators."
