        "text": "COMPTON (CBSLA.com) — Two Compton elementary schools were named Tuesday as winners of the National Blue Ribbon School Award by Education Secretary Arne Duncan.\n\nJefferson and Tibby elementary schools, part of the Compton Unified School District, were chosen for the honor, which recognizes high-performing students and best practices in teaching. A total of 337 schools nationwide received the awards.\n\nBoth schools were awarded in the category of \"Exemplary Achievement Gap Closing Schools.\" According to the Department of Education, both schools have a high percentage of economically disadvantaged students -- 94 percent at Jefferson and 87 percent at Tibby.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education began giving out the National Blue Ribbon Awards in 1982 to recognize academic excellence or progress in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups.\n\nOther Southern California winners of the award included Andrews School in Whittier, Lanai Road Elementary in Encino, Los Molinos Elementary in Hacienda Heights, Huntington Seacliff Elementary and William Newland Elementary in Huntington Beach and Gretchen Whitney High in Cerritos.\n\n(©2014 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
