Snoop Dogg was also in attendance and presented Dre with the first-of-its-kind honor.\n\n\"Dre, you my brother,\" Snoop said while presenting the award during the ceremony. \"It's an honor to know you, to work with you, to hang out with you and to present you with this very first ASCAP Hip-Hop Icon Award.\"\n\nDre was humbled by the honor.\n\n\"I can't imagine where my life would be without hip-hop,\" Dr. Dre told the crowd during his acceptance speech. \"I was thinking about what it means to be an icon. Someone or something worthy of great respect. You probably need to be around for a while to be worthy of this type of respect. So, I started doing the math, and I realized, that I've been involved, successful, relevant in hip-hop for 40 of its 50 years.\"\n\nRead More: Dr. Dre Inducts Eminem Into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nDr. Dre's Musical Legacy\n\nDr. Dre's musical legacy is undeniable.
