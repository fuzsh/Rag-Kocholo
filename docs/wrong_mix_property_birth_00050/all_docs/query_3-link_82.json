        "text": "The \"Empire State of Mind\" musician praised his 12-year-old's musical talent while his own industry impact was honored\n\nThe Carters are stepping out for Grammy night!\n\n\"Empire State of Mind\" artist JAY-Z received the 2nd annual Dr. Dre Global Impact Award during the awards show to honor his impactful legacy — and brought 12-year-old daughter Blue Ivy on stage to celebrate. \"Thank you very much. I used to say it was a sippy cup for Blue, but Blue's grown up now she doesn't take sippy cups,\" he began. \"And she has her own Grammys.\"\n\nThe proud father referenced Blue Ivy's win for best music video for her role in her mom Beyoncé's \"Brown Skin Girl\" video.\n\nWhile wife Beyoncé was cheering JAY-Z on from the audience, their twins — Rumi and Sir, 6½ — were not seen at the awards show.\n\nJAY-Z, 54, released his first album, Reasonable Doubt, in 1996. Since, he's shared hits The Blueprint, American Gangster, 4:44 and latest album HOV DID — and many more. He's long been vocal about his wish to give back — not just through music. The Dr. Dre Global Impact Award pays tribute to artists who have used their platform to give back, past just the musical medium.\n\nRelated: Blue Ivy Carter’s Amazing Dance Evolution on Beyoncé’s Renaissance Tour Shown in Comparison Video\n\nIt's not the first time Blue Ivy has been publicly involved — and on stage — in her parent's lives. The pre-teen has joined her mom on stage during her Renaissance Tour. For Beyoncé's birthday this year, her mom Tina Knowles shared a rare glimpse into the singer's home life. In the throwback picture, the singer's twins are toddlers, with Sir sitting on the far side of a bench as Rumi and big sister Blue helped Mom blow out her birthday candles.\n\n\"Screaming Happy Birthday to my daughter, my best friend, my confidant,\" Knowles captioned the shot. \"I thank God, for choosing me to be the vessel in which you traveled to get to this world. You are such rare and precious gift to the world not only as a genius entertainer. You are a gift because of your beautiful generous heart, the love you give. The grace you give, the wisdom that you show.\"\n\nKnowles continued, \"I could go on, and on but every word is true you deserve to have the happiest day ever because you give your heart and soul to the world happy birthday my firstborn snoogams❤️.\"\n\nEarlier this year, JAY-Z treated the couple's oldest to a father-daughter date at the 2023 Super Bowl, where the preteen posed on the sidelines ahead of the game. In the now-viral moment, JAY-Z was seen crouching down on the sidelines, taking different angles of Blue Ivy as she struck a pose.\n\nHowever, JAY-Z has revealed in the past that he doesn’t want to push any of his children into the business. \"Feeling loved is the most important thing a child needs, you know?\" he said during a 2021 interview with The Sunday Times. \"Not, 'Here's this business that I'm going to hand over to you, that I'm creating for you.' What if my child doesn't want to be in music or sports?\"\n\nJAY-Z continued: \"I have no idea, right? But as long as your child feels supported, and feels loved, I think anything is possible.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nSee PEOPLE's full coverage of the 66th annual Grammy Awards as they're broadcasting live on CBS from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
