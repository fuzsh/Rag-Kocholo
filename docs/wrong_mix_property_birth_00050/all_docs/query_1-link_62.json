Founded as a Methodist colony in 1867 and named for G.D. Compton, a pioneer settler, it developed as a farming village. Following an earthquake (March 10, 1933), which severely damaged the business district, the city was extensively modernized. Portions of Compton were heavily vandalized during riots in April 1992. The predominantly African American city is now a residential suburb and market centre, surrounded by diversified industries. A community college was established in Compton in 1927. Inc. 1888. Pop. (2000) 93,493; (2010) 96,455."
