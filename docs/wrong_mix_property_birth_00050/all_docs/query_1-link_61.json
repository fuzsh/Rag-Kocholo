        "text": "The 2024/2025 Scholarship Application is closed.\n\nThe 2025/2026 Scholarship Application will open October 1, 2024.\n\nFor additional information, please contact Financial Aid at financialaid@compton.edu\n\nCurrent Fall 2023 Compton College students are encouraged to explore the many scholarship opportunities based on a variety of criteria.\n\nFor details about current scholarship eligibility please view our Compton College Scholarships webpage.\n\nThe 2024/2025 Scholarship applications are currently under review and candidates will receive an email notification once all final decisions have been made.\n\nThe Compton College Scholarship Program is committed to supporting student success and access by recognizing and rewarding student achievement. A scholarship is a gift - college funds that do not have to be repaid. Many Compton College scholarships are made available through the generosity of private donors who have helped promote the college's continuing commitment to academic excellence.\n\nScholarships will be awarded during the 2024-2025 academic year to students who meet eligibility requirements. Most scholarships are for returning students and require full-time enrollment in the fall and spring semesters to receive the full award. A few scholarships are targeted for transfer students; verification of university enrollment is required prior to award disbursement. Applicants will be notified of decisions via their @compton.edu email in spring 2024.\n\nScholarship Tips\n\nCreate an insightful personal statement; this is an important part of your application that is reviewed closely. There is a 300-word minimum for your personal statement. Visit the Student Success Center (L-SSC, 2nd floor) or Transfer & Career Center (SSB, Room 266) for assistance. Please visit the Writing Center's webpage to view the online tutoring schedules. For more information on how to join these virtual tutoring sessions visit the Library webpage.\n\nYou will also be required to provide the name and email of a Compton College Classified employee or faculty member who will complete an online questionnaire about your academic potential, in-class achievements, and your character. Ideally, contact the Classified employee or faculty member as soon as possible. Allow enough time for them to agree to complete the questionnaire, and familiarize themselves with your academic progress, future goals and/or other first-hand knowledge of your college career.\n\nBeware of scholarship scams; you should never have to pay fees to apply for or search for scholarships. For more information view: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0082-scholarship-and-financial-aid-scams.\n\nOutside Scholarship\n\nSouthern California Association of Governments\n\nThe Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) annual Scholarship Program supports students working long-term career goals in planning or public service. The program provides a $4,000 scholarship award for seven high school or community college students from the SCAG region. Two additional scholarship awards not tied to a specific county may also be awarded at the Regional Council's discretion. Recipients may also have an opportunity to meet with their local government representatives and practicing planner to discuss the importance of urban planning and a future career in public service.\n\nStudents can now apply at https://scag.ca.gov/scholarship\n\nApplications are due electronically Friday, March 22, 2024."
