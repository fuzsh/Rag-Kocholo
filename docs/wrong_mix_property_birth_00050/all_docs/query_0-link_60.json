        "text": "From one billionaire to another, Dr. Dre is passing on some sage advice to Rihanna.\n\nThe trailblazing hip-hop super producer recently became a first-time Emmy Award winner for his epic Super Bowl LVI halftime performance with Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent, Anderson. Paak and Mary J. Blige.\n\nNow that the Fenty cosmetics mogul is confirmed to headline the forthcoming 2023 festivities, Dr. Dre said he can’t “wait to see what she’s going to do.”\n\nThe “Chronic” rapper reacted to the news during an interview with Apple Music’s Ebro Darden.\n\n“I actually just got the news that Rihanna’s going to do it, and I’m a super fan of Rihanna,” he told the radio personality on Sunday, as the news became official.\n\n“I just like her and what she does, and her get down, and how she approaches her artistry and the whole nine,” he continued. “It’s fantastic. She has the opportunity to really blow us away. I know we set the bar extremely high.”\n\nThe seven-time Grammy Award-winning Compton, Calif., native imparted some wisdom for the “Umbrella” singer going into the big showdown: “Put the right people around you, and have fun. That’s basically what it is, making sure you have the right creative people around you. She might want to look into some of the people that we used to do our show.”\n\nReflecting on his own Super Bowl experience, Dr. Dre revealed: “I don’t know if I’ve ever been that nervous before. Not only that, I don’t know if I’ve ever looked more forward to a Monday morning.”\n\n”You’re talking about at least 3,000 people that you have to depend on to get this show right for 13 minutes. So it is an extreme amount of pressure, but it’s fun at the same time,” he said.\n\n“When it’s done, it’s like goosebumps, bro. I got goosebumps, especially from the reaction that we got from the show, and especially being able to do the show with all of my friends.”\n\nIt all paid off, too: The Jesse Collins Entertainment-produced performance won the Primetime Emmy Award for outstanding variety special (live) earlier this month.\n\nSuper Bowl LVII marks the first year Apple Music will be sponsoring the halftime show, which was previously produced by Pepsi.\n\nThe big game is scheduled to take place Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.\n\n()"
