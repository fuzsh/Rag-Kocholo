        "text": "COMPTON, Calif. (KABC) -- Award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar received a major honor on Saturday as officials of his hometown of Compton have given him the key to the city.\n\nHis electrifying live performances in venues, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and his recordings have made Kendrick Lamar one of the music industry's most acclaimed artists.\n\nThe two-time Grammy winning rapper is nominated for eleven Grammys for his latest album, \"To Pimp a Butterfly.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the 28-year-old star received another honor as Compton Mayor Aja Brown presented Lamar with the key to the city where he was born and raised.\n\n\"He has a consciousness, and he realizes music is not just for entertainment but it's for messaging,\" Brown said.\n\nLamar still spends much of his time in Compton, contributing to schools and programs to help the community.\n\n\"It's the biggest thing. It's really not about how famous I get, it's really about me utilizing my platform and giving it back to these kids because that's what I wanted as a kid,\" Lamar said. \"Everything that I do is a reflection of how I felt when I was younger.\"\n\nLamar said he never dreamed of winning a Grammy as a kid, but he was always passionate about music.\n\nHe wants kids in his community to understand they can come out of any environment and achieve success.\n\n\"Continue to practice the dream, whatever the dream is...,\" he said. \"My message to them is that it don't stop here.\""
