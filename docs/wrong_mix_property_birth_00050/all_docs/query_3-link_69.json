        "text": "Review\n\nMusic Features\n\nKendrick Lamar takes the West Coast off standby\n\nLamar's blowout Juneteenth concert, held at the Forum in Los Angeles and live-streamed on Amazon Music, planted flags for the future of LA rap, while uniting in hate for a certain Toronto titan.\n\nThe Super Bowl halftime show was a mixture of respectability and reckoning\n\nEven with the petite moments of refusal, the whole performance feels like hip-hop's audition for an all-American passport.\n\nNational Recording Registry Announces 2020 Entries, From Dr. Dre To Mister Rogers\n\nThis year's additions to the Library of Congress' showcase of the breadth and depth of American sound include The Chronic, Tina Turner and the theme song from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\n\nTell 'Em Where You're From: The Regional Anthems That Move Us\n\nSome sprout from the cities and states they rep for; others are imports, held up in pride by a sister community. NPR's American Anthem series continues with a list of place-based bangers.\n\nWhat Did 'The Defiant Ones' Show Us?\n\nThe HBO mini-series portrays the story of Apple Music's Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, who came together to work on some of the 20th century's most important music.\n\nDr. Dre's Rapid 'Gunfire' Flow Affirms And Defies His Age\n\nThe new song comes in conjunction with the revealing HBO documentary The Defiant Ones, which intertwines the lives and legacies of Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine.\n\n'The Defiant Ones' Tells The Story Of An Unlikely Music-Biz Duo\n\nThe new HBO mini-series charts the shared and individual histories of Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, whose partnership helped redefine hip-hop and rock music.\n\n'The Defiant Ones' Tells The Story Of An Unlikely Music-Biz Duo\n\nListen · 3:54 3:54\n\nBiopic 'Straight Outta Compton' Tells The Epic Story Of Hip-Hop And N.W.A\n\nThe original members of N.W.A produced the film, which opens nationwide Friday. Like the group's story, the making of Straight Outta Compton — which took 11 years — is filled with drama.\n\nBiopic 'Straight Outta Compton' Tells The Epic Story Of Hip-Hop And N.W.A\n\nListen · 7:05 7:05\n\nReview\n\nMusic Reviews\n\nAfter 16 Years, Dr. Dre Returns With 'Compton'\n\nThe producer behind the West Coast gangsta rap sound looks back over his career on a long-awaited album that sounds less like one man's vanity project than a grand group effort.\n\nAfter 16 Years, Dr. Dre Returns With 'Compton'\n\nListen · 3:08 3:08\n\nDr. Dre's 'Compton': Who Are The Album's New Artists?\n\nHe gave us Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar.
