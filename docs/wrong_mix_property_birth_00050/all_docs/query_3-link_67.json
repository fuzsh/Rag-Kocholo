        "text": "Dr. Dre, Missy Elliott, and Lil Wayne are already 2023 Grammy winners! The rap icons will be receiving the Grammy’s Global Impact Award at this year’s ceremony to honor them for their “personal and professional achievements in the music industry” at the second annual Black Music Collective event. It will be held at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles on February 2. Music executive Sylvia Rhone will also be honored with the award.\n\n“I am so thrilled to honor and celebrate these four giants in the music industry,” Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said in a statement. “Last year’s inaugural event was such a highlight during GRAMMY Week and now with Dre, Missy, Wayne, and Sylvia there to pay tribute to this year, it’s definitely going to be another night to remember. I continue to be proud of the work of our Black Music Collective as it’s a vital part of what we do here at the Academy.”\n\nThe 2023 Recording Academy Honors presented by The Black Music Collective are a part of Grammy Week. The week-long event concludes with the official ceremony on February 5, 2023, at the Crypto.com Arena.\n\nWhen it comes to nominations for the Grammy’s this year, Beyoncé leads all artists with nine nominations, followed by Kendrick Lamar with eight. Adele follows with seven nods, while Future, Lizzo, and Mary J. Blige each have six.\n\n50 Of The Best Hip-Hop Songs Of 2022\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
