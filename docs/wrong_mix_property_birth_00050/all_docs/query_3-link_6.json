        "text": "Dr. Dre has proven that an artist's job can go far beyond writing lyrics and performing at venues. In his nearly 40-year career, he has founded his own record label, Aftermath Entertainment, co-founded Beats Electronics, endowed the USC Jimmy Iovine and Andrew Young Academy, and much more.\n\nTo celebrate his massive achievements, the Recording Academy and Black Music Collective created the Global Impact Award, named in his honor. Relive the moment Dr. Dre accepted the inaugural gramophone in this episode of GRAMMY Rewind.\n\n\"I know everybody in here probably knows this already, but this is the 50th anniversary of hip-hop,\" Dr. Dre said at the beginning of his speech. \"Make some noise for hip-hop!\"\n\nIn his eyes, one of the most rewarding parts of his work is the collaboration. \"Assembling a team with talented artists, engineers, and musicians with gifts different from mine and who shine in ways that I don't have been both inspiring and crucial to my success,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I'm extremely grateful to all of those who have comprised that team over the years, and I would not be here accepting this award without their contribution.\"\n\nBefore heading off the stage, Dr. Dre gave one encouraging message to the next wave of music's changemakers: \"What I love about this award is that it uses my name to inspire the next generation of producers, artists, and entrepreneurs to reach for their greatness and demand that from everybody around you. Never compromise your vision. Pursue quality over quantity. And remember everything is important.\"\n\nWatch the video above for Dr. Dre's complete acceptance speech for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award at the 2023 GRAMMYs.\n\nCheck back to GRAMMY.com for more new episodes of GRAMMY Rewind, and be sure to tune into the 2024 GRAMMYs on Sunday, Feb. 4, airing live on the CBS Television Network (8-11:30 p.m. LIVE ET/5-8:30 p.m. LIVE PT) and streaming on Paramount+ (live and on-demand for Paramount+ with SHOWTIME subscribers, or on-demand for Paramount+ Essential subscribers the day after the special airs).\n\nEssential Hip-Hop Releases From The 1990s: Snoop Dogg, Digable Planets, Jay-Z & More\n\nGRAMMY winners Kendrick Lamar and Mustard have long repped their California roots. Earlier this summer, their powerhouse anthem \"Not Like Us\" brought West Coast rap back to its roots and shone a global spotlight on the scene.\n\nLamar and Mustard are at the forefront of a renaissance in West Coast rap. Their shared roots in Southern California cities â€” Mustard from Los Angeles and Kendrick from Compton â€” adds authenticity and resonance to their partnership. Their undeniable chemistry was on display in the video for \"Not Like Us,\" which received a million views less than an hour after its release.\n\nMustard's signature beats and Lamar's profound lyricism has resurfaced the sound and culture that makes West Coast rap so unique and paved the way for a new generation of artists. All signs suggest that another impactful collaboration may appear on Mustard's upcoming album, Faith of A Mustard Seed.\n\nLearn more: A Guide To Southern California Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From L.A. & Beyond\n\nKendrick Lamar headlined the electrifying Pop Out concert on Juneteenth, which also featured sets from Mustard and DJ Hed. The event saw a handful of L.A. rappers, opening for Lamar in a showcase of the vibrant talent that defines the region's rap scene.\n\nThe West Coast is a vast reservoir of talent, stretching from the Bay Area to Seattle. At the heart of this creative expanse is Los Angeles, which brings fresh perspectives, innovative styles, and renewed energy to hip-hop, ensuring the genre thrives. With the stage set for these newcomers to shine, it's the perfect time to take a closer look at some of the rising talents poised to impact the rap scene. While this list only scratches the surface, it offers a glimpse into the diverse and exciting talent from SoCal, the epicenter of the West.\n\nBlxst\n\nArising from Los Angeles, Blxst initially played the background as a producer but soon demonstrated his ability to excel across all facets of music creation. Blxst's breakout moment came with his platinum-certified single \"Chosen,\" which solidified his place in the music industry. His collaboration on Kendrick Lamar's \"Die Hard\" from Mr. Morale And The Big Steppers further showcased his skill for crafting hooks that elevate tracks, resulting in two GRAMMY nominations.\n\nAs he prepares to release his debut album, I'll Always Come Find You on July 19, Blxst stands at a pivotal point in his career. With a great resume already to his name, his forthcoming album promises to showcase his undeniable talent and leave a lasting impact on the West Coast music scene.\n\nBino Rideaux\n\nBino Rideaux is a South Central native and frequent collaborator with the GRAMMY-winning rapper Nipsey Hussle. He is the only artist to have a joint project with Hussle, No Pressure, released before the prolific rapper's untimely death. Rideaux has hinted at having a treasure of unreleased music with Hussle, saved for the perfect moment and album.\n\nRideaux is known for creating tracks that get the city outside and dancing. He has made three beloved projects with Blxst, titled Sixtape, Sixtape 2, and Sixtape 3 resulting in sold-out shows and a special place in West Coast Rap fans' hearts. Endorsed by industry heavyweights like Young Thug, Rideaux continues to carve his path at his own pace. His journey is nothing short of a marathon, echoing the enduring legacy of his mentor.\n\nRead more: Nipsey Hussle's Entrepreneurial Legacy: How The Rapper Supported His Community & Inspired Rap's Next Generation\n\nKalan.FrFr\n\nKalan.FrFr, whose name stands for \"For Real For Real,\" is an artist whose music is as genuine as his name suggests. Growing up in Compton and Carson, Kalan.FrFr has always stayed true to his roots, and exudes the unyielding confidence essential to making it in the City of Angels.\n\nHis breakthrough mixtape, TwoFr, showcased his ability to shine without major features, delivering verses with catchy hooks and melodic rap. He's shown he's not confined to one sound, delivering vulnerable tracks like \"Going Through Things'' and \"Never Lose You.\" His EP Make the West Great Again, Kalan.FrFr both proves his loyalty to his origins and highlights his versatility. Kalan.FrFr's signature punch-in, no-writing-lyrics-down style keeps his fans on their toes, ensuring that whatever comes next is unpredictable but authentic.\n\nJayson Cash\n\nJayson Cash, a rapper hailing from Carson â€” the same city as TDE artist Ab-Soul â€” stays true to West Coast rap, from his lyrics to his beat selection. Listening to Jayson Cash's music is like diving into a vivid life narrative. His prowess as a lyricist and storyteller shines through in every verse. He gives his fans an insight into his journey, making it a relatable music experience.\n\nCash made waves with his debut mixtape, Read The Room, and scored a Mustard beat on the song \"Top Down.\" Two years later, their collaboration continues, with Cash writing on Mustard's upcoming album. Though often seen as an underdog, Cash is not to be underestimated, earning cosigns from West Coast legends like Suga Free and Snoop Dogg. His latest project, Alright Bet, includes a notable feature from Dom Kennedy.\n\n310babii\n\n310babii has achieved platinum-selling status at just 18 years old, while successfully graduating high school. Yet 310babii's career began in seventh grade, when he recording songs on his phone showing early signs of motivation and creativity. His 2023 breakout hit \"Soak City (Do It)\" quickly gained traction on TikTok â€” and caught the ears of Travis Scott and NFL player CJ Stroud.\n\nAs the song grew in popularity, it led to a remix produced by Mustard, who invited the Inglewood native to join him onstage during his set at The Pop Out. 310babii's innovative spirit shines through in his distinctive visuals, exemplified by the captivating video for his song \"Back It Up.\" His recent debut album, Nights and Weekends, released in February, underscores his evolving talent and promise within the music industry.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nKoe Wetzel On How New Album '9 Lives' Helped Him Tap Into His Feelings\n\nThe New GRAMMY GO Music Production Course Is Now Open: Featuring GRAMMY Winners Hit-Boy, CIRKUT, Judith Sherman & More\n\nAyoni Performs \"Bitter In Love\"\n\nKCON L.A. 2024 Returns: Get Ready With This Playlist Featuring NCT 127, Zerobaseone, ENHYPEN, Zico & More\n\nOn 'Mirada,' Ivan Cornejo Redefines The Sound Of Sad SierreÃ±o And Helps Fans Heal Through Music\n\nAmongst BeyoncÃ©'s expansive catalog, \"Halo\" is easily one of her most iconic songs.

I love you. And I'd like to thank all of my fans for their support over the years.\"\n\nThe five other awards BeyoncÃ© took home that night were for the coveted Song Of The Year (\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\") and four R&B Categories: Best Contemporary R&B Album (I Am... Sasha Fierce), Best R&B Song (\"Single Ladies\"), Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (\"Single Ladies\"), and Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance (for her cover of Etta James' \"At Last\").\n\nAs of 2024, BeyoncÃ© has won the most GRAMMY Awards in history with 32 wins.\n\nPress play on the video above to relive Queen Bey's \"Halo\" win for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and check back to GRAMMY.com for more new episodes of GRAMMY Rewind.\n\nEnter The World Of BeyoncÃ©\n\nBeyoncÃ©'s New Album 'Cowboy Carter' Is Here: Check Out The Featured Artists, Cover Songs, And Tracklist\n\nHow Many GRAMMYs Has BeyoncÃ© Won? 10 Questions About The 'Renaissance' Singer Answered\n\n5 Takeaways From BeyoncÃ©'s New Album 'Renaissance'\n\nThe Creative Rebirth Of BeyoncÃ© On '4' | For The Record"
