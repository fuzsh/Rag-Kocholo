At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on six reviews, while on the other hand, Live Life Fast received largely negative reception from audiences, leading many people to believe that Ricch became another prominent young artist to succumb to the sophomore slump.[36]\n\nMain article: Feed Tha Streets III\n\nTo start off 2022, Ricch released a collaboration with fellow rapper Fredo Bang, titled \"Last ones Left\".[37] On May 12, 2022, Ricch was featured on Post Malone's single, \"Cooped Up\", which appeared on the latter's fourth studio album, Twelve Carat Toothache.

Exactly three weeks later, on May 31, 2024, Ricch released the song “Survivor's Remorse”. which is rumored to be the lead single for his upcoming third studio album The Navy Album.[46]\n\nA beef between Ricch and American rapper Lil Uzi Vert had begun during late 2022. The beef began when Roddy Ricch was on set for DJ Khaled's song \"Keep Going\"; and the video shoot shows Ricch wearing big, clunky boots, Uzi later posted a picture of Ricch's boots on their Instagram with a caption saying, \"Wtffff... Who is this??? I only saw the boots. I hope (it's) a normal person... BIG BOOTS\". Ricch responded on his 2022 single \"Aston Martin Truck\", where Ricch rapped, \"N****s not on my level, why you mad I your ? / Had to say it ’cause you talkin’, I ain’t even tryna rub it in\". In 2023, Lil Uzi dissed Ricch on their third studio album, Pink Tape (2023), on the song titled ''Died and came Back\". On the song, Uzi rapped, \"But you ain't even go get your chains back (Huh?) / They ran up in your crib and took your platinum plaques (Yeah) / I thought that you was ****, what's up with that? (What's up with it?) / I like the Crips 'cause the money in my pocket blue / I be with the Bloods and they all say, \"Soowoo\" / What you paid for your rent, I paid that for my shoes / If you try to diss me, boy, that's a lose-lose / Moncler on me since Luv Is Rage 2 / When I made the first Luv Is Rage, it was Canadian Goose\", referring to Ricch's association with the Park Village Crips.[47][48]\n\nIn April 2020, Ricch's girlfriend Allie Minati gave birth to their son.[49][50]\n\nIn August 2019, Ricch was arrested for felony domestic violence, the charges of which were later dropped by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office due to insufficient evidence.[51] On June 11, 2022, Ricch was arrested on weapons charges after him and members of his crew were stopped at a security checkpoint near Citi Field, where law enforcement found a loaded firearm, additional ammunition, and a large-capacity magazine.[52] The charges were later dropped.[53]\n\nI feel like the problem with us nowadays is we want everything right now. But the music isn't gonna be progressive when you're putting something out every three months, because you ain't been through nothing; you still feel like how you felt when you [last] dropped the music. To me, stuff doesn't happen in my life every single day. Maybe for some people it does, but my life don't happen that fast. I have to give myself time to actually go through things so I can speak on it, and have a new understanding of life. It's not like I make music that's not my life, so I feel like I need to give my life time to inspire me.\n\n— Ricch in an interview with Variety, 2020.[28]\n\nOn the transcending themes of his music, Ricch draws inspiration from his life, stating: \"As I experience life, my music is going to evolve. At the same time, I still do tell the stories from my world because there are unlimited stories and unlimited people from that place. I'll always represent them. As my life begins to change and I do different things, I still want to be able to tap in and relate to them\".[54] Cady Lang of Time magazine noted Ricch's \"remarkable musical style as a rapper combines his West Coast [hip hop] roots with the sound of trap music and Chicago drill rap, which gets an extra gravitas with his lyrics that range from pondering the tough realities of life to bouts of uninhibited bravado\".[20] Ricch has been recognized for his raspy voice \"that works wonders with vocal filters\".[55] Paul Thompson of Vulture called Ricch \"an undeniably talented vocalist and occasionally a compelling songwriter\", opining how he \"frequently adopts the same syntax and vocal intonations as Young Thug\".[56] His music style blends rapping and singing.[57] Ricch has cited Kendrick Lamar, who is also from his hometown of Compton, as a musical influence.[58] He has stated that rapper Speaker Knockerz is his biggest influence, along with the \"basis\" of his music coming from him. Ricch also credits Young Thug, Future, and Gucci Mane as influences.[7]\n\nMain article: Roddy Ricch discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nPlease Excuse Me for Being Antisocial (2019)\n\nLive Life Fast (2021)\n\nThe Navy Album (2024)\n\nBiography portal\n\nCalifornia portal\n\nList of awards and nominations received by Roddy Ricch\n\nList of artists who reached number one in the United States\n\nList of people from Compton, California"
