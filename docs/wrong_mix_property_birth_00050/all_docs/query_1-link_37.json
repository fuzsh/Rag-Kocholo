        "text": "Public high school in Compton, California\n\nCentennial High School is a public high school in Compton, California, operating as part of the Compton Unified School District.\n\nConstruction of Centennial High School began in 1953, and it was erected in 1954, with its first graduating class in 1954. It is the smallest of the three high schools in the Compton Unified School District, which also includes Compton High School and Manuel Dominguez High School.\n\nApproximately 1,370 students attend Centennial High School.\n\n9th Grade: 450\n\n10th Grade: 329\n\n11th Grade: 319\n\n12th Grade: 272\n\nThe ethnic composition of the student body is:[2]\n\n64% Latino\n\n33% African-American\n\n1% Two or more races\n\n2% Other, multiple, declined to state, or non-response.\n\nStudents speak English and/or Spanish. 48% of the students are Second-Language Learners (SLL) with 33% of the total enrollment classified as Limited English Proficiency (LEP).\n\nSpecial Education students comprise 11% of the total enrollment. Of this, 5% are identified as Resource Specialist Program (RSP) and 6% as Special Day Class (SDC).\n\nAll students in attendance qualify for the National School Lunch Program receiving free or reduced breakfast and lunch.\n\nThe certificated staff and faculty at Centennial High School is ethnically composed of the following as of 2009:[3]\n\n43% African-American\n\n1% American Indian or Alaska Native\n\n6% Asian\n\n27% Caucasian\n\n3% Filipino\n\n11% Latino\n\n1% Pacific Islander\n\n7% Multiple or No Response.\n\nThe California Department of Education mandates a qualification for subject teaching known as a \"Clear Credential\".[4] 91% of certificated staff hold a Clear Credential and all except for five staff members met the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) requirements of \"Highly Qualified Teacher\".[5][6]\n\nThe school offers eleven Advanced Placement courses.\n\nCentennial High School is designated by the Compton Unified School District as a Title I school. For over 5 years, the school has remained a Program Improvement (PI) school.[7][8] As of the 2009-2010 school year, Centennial is in state rank 1 and also ranks 1 with similar schools.[9][10][11]\n\nCentennial High School has not met its state-identified goals for student progress in all areas each year since 2006. Students failed to meet the No Child Left Behind Act's Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) requirements in English Language Arts (ELA) or Mathematics for all significant subgroups.[12] Centennial remains in year 5+ of school-wide Program Improvement (PI).[7]\n\nCAHSEE English Language Arts (ELA): In 2010, of 270 sophomores, 177 passed the ELA examination, or 66%. Of this number, 52 of 82 African-American students passed, or 63%. 122 of 182 Latino students passed, or 67%.\n\nCAHSEE Mathematics: In 2010, of 275 sophomores, 163 passed the Math examination, or 59%. Of this number, 43 of 83 African-American students passed, or 52%. 116 of 185 Latino students passed, or 63%.\n\nCalifornia Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) Program: California requires a minimum Academic Performance Index (API) score of at least 650. As of 2010, Centennial High School's API was 573,[13] well below the statewide performance target of 800. Test scores indicate that the vast majority of students are not proficient or advanced and many of them are far below grade level in all core academic areas.\n\nIdentified as a Tier 1 school in the Spring of 2010 by the California Department of Education (CDOE), Centennial High School had a standing graduation rate of 58.9% and since then has been reclassified as a “persistently low-achieving school” by the Assessment and Accountability Division,[14][15] with graduation rates below 60% for three years or more. California State and Federal Government guidelines for high school graduation rates dictate that all schools should be at 83%, or grow .01% over the past year or .02% over the past 2 years. Currently, the graduation rate at Centennial High School is 58.9%. Therefore, Centennial has chosen the \"Transformation Intervention Model\"[16][17] in an effort to increase retention of students, student achievement and the site’s graduation rate.\n\nThe Centennial Apaches compete in the Bay League of the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF).\n\nArron Afflalo (Class of 2004), basketball player[18]\n\nLarry Allen, former NFL player (transferred before graduating)\n\nBrittany Barber (Class of 2004), Singer/ Songwriter [19]\n\nBig Fase 100, rapper[20]\n\nOmar Bradley (Class of 1976; voted \"Mr. Apache\" in senior class poll), mayor of Compton (1993-2001)[21]\n\nDeonte Burton (Class of 2010), basketball player[22]\n\nKen Dennis Masters world record sprinter\n\nDr. Dre, rapper & music producer[23][24]\n\nCharles Dumas, high jumper[25][26]\n\nAllan Ellis, former NFL player\n\nDonte Gamble, former CFL player\n\nMitch Johnson, former NFL player[27]\n\nKendrick Lamar, record producer, rapper and protégée of Dre[28][29]\n\nPaul Lowe, former NFL player[30]\n\nDon Wilson (baseball), (Class of 1963) former Major League Baseball pitcher for the Houston Astros\n\nLenny Randle, (Class of 1967) former Major League Baseball {MLB} player [31]\n\nReggie Smith, baseball player[32]\n\nWayne Simpson, former Major League Baseball pitcher\n\nBobby Thompson, former NFL player\n\nFrank K.
