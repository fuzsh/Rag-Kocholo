At-risk male students at three elementary schools and one middle school in the Compton Unified School District will be selected to participate in the program. The goals and objectives of the program include: (1) reducing the number of students who enter into gangs, (2) increasing the academic achievement of student participants by 25% in math and language arts within a two-year period, (3) teaching students how to resolve conflicts at school, in the community and at home, (4) improving the partnerships between parents, community, and local businesses, and (5) providing a safety-net for students to learn and to achieve their educational goals. Performance measures will include, but are not limited to, student-level data including violence, gang activity, and academic performance (i.e., suspensions, expulsions attendance, number of credits completed/attempted).
