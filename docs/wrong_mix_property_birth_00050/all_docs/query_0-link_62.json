        "text": "Dr. Dre is set to receive his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday, Mar. 19. His star will live next to his longtime friend and collaborator, Snoop Dogg‘s, in front of the Jimmy Kimmel Studio.\n\nSnoop Dogg will also speak during the ceremony, alongside Interscope Records co-founder Jimmy Iovine. Radio legend Big Boy will serve as the emcee.\n\n“Dr. Dre’s contributions to the music industry are undeniable and have left an indelible mark on popular culture,” said Ana Martinez, producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in a statement. “As a producer, rapper, and entrepreneur, Dr. Dre has continuously pushed boundaries and set new standards for excellence. It is with great pride that we honor his incredible career and extraordinary impact by awarding him a star on the Walk of Fame.”\n\nMartinez concluded, “Dr. Dre’s star will serve as a lasting symbol of his immense talent and enduring legacy in the world of music,“ before deeming his star location “special.”\n\nThis achievement comes after N.W.A. was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 Grammys. Though Dre was unable to accept the award in-person, Ice Cube joked, “He wanted to make sure you know he not hatin’. You know he a billionaire. He got sh*t to do.”"
