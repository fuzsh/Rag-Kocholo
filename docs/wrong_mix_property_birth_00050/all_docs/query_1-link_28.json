        "text": "COMPTON, Calif. (KABC) -- Two Compton elementary schools were selected to receive National Blue Ribbon honors, an award that recognizes academic excellence.\n\nTibby and Thomas Jefferson elementary schools were among 24 schools chosen in California and 337 schools across the country.\n\n\"It's an unbelievably proud day for us,\" Tibby Elementary Principal Ontrece Ellerbe said. \"Our students understand that they've made history today.\"\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of Education selects schools that demonstrate student achievement and best teaching practices.\n\nJefferson Elementary Principal Mario Marcos points out there's no magic formula. Administrators and teachers just needed to convince students that hard work in the classroom pays off.\n\n\"Geography is not important. We truly believe that every child has the intellectual capability to achieve at high levels once they cross those school gates,\" Marcos said.\n\nParental involvement is another key element to the success at both schools.\n\n\"I noticed that when my children see that I'm up here and they see that I'm here volunteering, it makes them more active in their classroom. It makes them appreciate coming to school,\" parent Veronica Higgins said.\n\nThe national award is the Compton Unified School District's first ever.\n\n\"When I heard about the award, I was so happy, because our school is a great school and everybody needs to see,\" Tibby Elementary student Valerie Fraga said."
