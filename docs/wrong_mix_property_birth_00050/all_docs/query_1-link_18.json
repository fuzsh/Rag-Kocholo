        "text": "Photo via Compton City Hall's Twitter\n\nToday, Kendrick Lamar was awarded the key to the city of Compton. Mayor Aja Brown honored Lamar, quoting \"Alright\" during her introduction, and later, playfully said that Compton's key is \"better than Drake's key.\" When Lamar walked up to accept his key, he said, \"This is crazy.\" Find video below and a Periscope of the full ceremony here.\n\nYG was among the Compton citizens present during the ceremony. A bunch of students performed \"i\" and \"Alright,\" and there were some dance performances set to medleys of his songs. Oddly, one of the speakers during the ceremony took an opportunity to specifically diss Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug, calling their music \"a bunch of mumbo jumbo.”\n\n\"Kendrick Lamar is a phenomenal artist whose work has served as a catalyst to raise a new level of consciousness for this generation,\" said Brown in a statement prior to the ceremony (via The Los Angeles Times). \"His message challenges the status quo and motivates listeners to rethink our society's institutions.\""
