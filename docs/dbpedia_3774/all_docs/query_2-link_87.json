This announcement follows the departure of the Governor’s current Chief of Staff, Gardner Pate, effective July 26, 2024.\n\n“With over three decades of political, government, and corporate experience, Robert Black’s wealth of knowledge and deep understanding of Texas will be instrumental in our efforts to build a bigger, better Texas,” said Governor Abbott. “Gardner Pate’s outstanding service helped my team navigate a challenging legislative session and multiple special sessions that resulted in major achievements for all Texans. I am grateful for Gardner’s remarkable leadership and his unwavering service to the State of Texas.”"
