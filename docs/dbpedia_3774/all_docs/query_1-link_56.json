(https://www.rct.uk/collection/405007/a-view-of-balmoral)\n\nAnd yes, the historic evidence reveals that King Robert II was from a lineage of Black royalty.\n\nThe etymology of Bal is from the Carthaginian/Phoenician/Kushite origin Bal/Baal/Bel (see MFIT issues # 6 & 7) and is an ancient location of the Wolof people of West Africa (Baol). The derivative of Mor is from Moor/Maur which means Black (see issue # 7). Balmoral was named by the primordial rulers of northern Baratanac or Scotland.\n\nWhere does the current ‘Charles III’ fit within this royal Black lineage?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
