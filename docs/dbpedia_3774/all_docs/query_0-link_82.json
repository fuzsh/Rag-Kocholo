        "text": "Birth circa 1700 Robert may have been born as early as circa 1700. Possibly in Scotland or Ireland.\n\nSome claim that this is the Robert that was likely born in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, Scotland on the River Clyde with parents of James Black and Margaret Livingstone both of whom immigraded to Christchurch in New Zeeland and died there about 1746., but I do not agree.2,3 I believe that his parents are the John Black with an unnamed wife that are buried in the SAME cemetery as Robert, that is, Black's graveyard in Adams county, Pennsylvania.\n\nBirth circa 1716 Robert may have been born as late as circa 1716 tho this seems unlikely as he had a son by 1724.\n\nMarriage 1723 Robert Black The first married Sarah M Malachai about 1723. It is possible that they were married BEFORE they came to the colonies.4\n\n1740 Black's Graveyard was established about 1740 and is NW of Gettysburg in Cumberland township.(Area was also called Marsh Creek.) The Presbyterian church that was there is now the Gettysburg Presbyterian church in town. We were told this by a woman to whom we talked in order to get directions to the graveyard. Another Presbyterian church in the area is the Great Conewago Church built in 1787.5\n\nHouse across the street from Black's GraveYardBlack Gap Road sign 2012\n\n1740 Between 1735-36 and 1741 a number of Irish peasantry from the hills of Tyrone, Derry, Cavan, and Sligo Counties, came hither to stay, to erect a free home for themselves at the foot of the old South Mountains. The Hamiltons, Sweenys, Eddys, Blacks, McClains, McClures, Wilsons, Agnews, Darbys and others were here, near Gettysubrg, in 1841. Then came the landlords’ agent to survey the “Manor of Maske,” and a second one to drive off the “squatters,” or obtain from them pay for the permission to work in the heat of summer and cold of winter among the rocky hills, who declared “yt if ye Chain be spread again, he wou’d stop it, and then stop ye Compass from ye Surv. Gen.” The men who resisted the survey of the “Manor of Maske” were prosecuted, but the wisdom of the Penns prompted a fair settlement with the squatters, which resulted in the Irish peasant becoming his own laborer and master, his own tenant and landlord. This same band of fighters for the right, organized for defense against the Indians and shared in the honors of saving the frontier from many an Indian raid. This same band of peasants first saw the tyranny of the “tea tax,” and were among the first to hail the Revolution. They were among the first to recognize the liberty\n\nconventions and swear fealty to the act of such conventions in 1775. They were the men who formed McPherson’s battalion in 1775, and the Eleventh Pennsylvania Regiment of the line in 1776.\n\nThey spoke bad Irish and as bad English, but their shout was heard unmistakably wherever the wave of revolution struck, and when, with their brothers of the\n\nthirteen stars, they raised the flag of the Union, they, at that moment saw the shackles fall from the husbandman, and the industry and liberty march forward\n\nover the trails and military roads cut by the retreating soldiers of Great Britain.6\n\nfrom Adams county gen web site.1886 History of Adams County, PA\n\nOriginally published as History of Cumberland and Adams Counties\n\nWarner, Beers & Co. 1886\n\nSecond reprint 1980 by The Bookmark, PO Box 74, Knightstown, Ind 46148\n\n1740 It appears that Robert came to Adams Co., PA with the first settlers abt 1740. He lived on a farm lying in Cumberland and Mt. Joy Townshps; Rock Creek passed through the land; he erected a grist mill and saw mill; erected a 3-story stone house; farmer; had a total of 8 children.\n\np 241\n\nPioneers of Cumberland Twp.,squatters of the original 'Manor of Maske'. This list was made in 1765, recorded in 1792 with the aid of the descendants of the old settlers. names & dates of original improvements of the land.7\n\n1740 His heirs had property rights in 'Manor of Maske' from 1738. in Franklin Twp. Adams county, PA. He appears to have been on the Squatter list in Adams co as early as May 1740.8\n\n1740 Sarah and Robert had a 'Plantation' at Blacks Gap in Adams county, PA in 1740. About at Shippenburg Road. The plantation was called Cross Keys.9\n\n1745 It is said that they had 8 children, we only have 3.\n\n1747 Black's Gap road in Adams county, Pennsylvannia was built about 1747 west from York thru Abbottstown and New Oxford, now US 30, to a point west of New Oxford and was named for this man. Then goes then NW thru' Hunterstown and Mummasburg to Hilltown, crosses the mountains at Black's Gap at Cashtown, now called Cashtown Gap and into the Cumberland Valley. This road is sometimes referred to as Hilltown Road west of Cashtown. 10\n\nDeath 2 April 1760 Robert died on 2 April 1760 t Gettysburg Cumberland twp, Adams, Pennsylvania.11 Did he actually die in Gettysburg and NOT on his \"plantation\"?\n\nBurial He is buried in Black's Graveyard in Adams county, Pennsylvania. .11,12\n\nNOTE: That all of the markers in this cemetery FACE AWAY from the street. Does this suggest that the church was on the rear of this lot??\n\n1785 Franklin Township was formed on the last Tuesday of October 1785 during the quarterly session of the York County Court. It was taken from what was then Cumberland Township, York County. This newly formed township was named after Benjamin Franklin and was comprised of mostly woodlands with small parcels of farmland.\n\nFranklin Township encompasses 72 square miles. Eighty miles of roads wind through its boundaries, the most road miles maintained within the county. Thirteen miles of roadway are still dirt covered. The first road traveling through Franklin Township was the \"Black’s Gap Road\", which is known today as Hilltown Road.13\n\nTherefore Robert and Sarah Black lived in York amd ADAMS county during their lifetimes without moving.."
