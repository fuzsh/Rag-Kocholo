People can struggle to remember presentation bullet points, and yet vividly describe the metaphors of a cartoon weeks or years later.\n\nRobert also draws cartoons on commission, both individually and in series. Typical uses for this are management books, company safety campaigns, websites, presentations, manuals and videos."
