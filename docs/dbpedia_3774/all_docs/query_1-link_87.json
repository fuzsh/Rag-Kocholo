        "text": "Creative nonfiction of black and white brotherhood in struggles for freedom during the American Revolutionary War and Irish Uprising of 1796-98. All characters and major events are historical.\n\nTony heals Lord Edward with cymbee water\n\nThe Cymbee [Simbi] water spirits of St. John's Berkeley were thought by some, as they are today, to provide special healing powers. The author uses this legend to create the process used by Tony Small to heal Lord Edward after he was left for dead on the battlefield of Eutaw Springs, September 8, 1781.\n\nTony Small has a mind of his own.\n\nFrom Chapter 1, \"Tony's World.\" All characters are real based on historical research. Circumstances are creative nonfiction to time and place. Narratives are fictional."
