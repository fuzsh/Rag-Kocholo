        "text": "INITIAL CONSULTATION:\n\nThe design process starts with a meeting to walk through your project, discuss your wish list (functional needs, aesthetic preferences, and budget requirements) and establish an initial project scope. Through this collaboration, the “program” develops. The program outlines the list of needs or function for the space.\n\nPRE DESIGN:\n\nThis involves a site visit to measure and document the existing structure and/or site conditions. We will prepare existing condition drawings and research building code and zoning regulations relevant to the project. These drawings will be used as the base for the next phases of the project.\n\nSCHEMATIC DESIGN:\n\nSchematic design is a fluid process during the project where we prepare conceptual design sketches, drawings or graphic 3d models that are developed based on the project program and pre design phase. These drawings will assist in making early decisions for the design direction of the project. We strongly believe in the ability to hand sketch conceptual ideas is an important part of the early design phase. Once a schematic design is approved, we recommend bringing in qualified contractors early in the process for a initial cost study. The benefit of this step is to establish a budget and have a contractor onboard as the project develops in the next phases.\n\nDESIGN DEVELOPMENT:\n\nOnce we establish a design direction we will further develop and refine the design and 3D model to work out any conflicts and to start finalizing material choices. We develop important details and additional layouts of lighting and cabinetry. We can also make recommendations for selections of specific fixtures, finishes and other products.\n\nCONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTATION:\n\nThis important phase in the project is when we take the design development drawings and detail them as well as coordinate the project with project consultants. We will provide the necessary floor plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules and code information to communicate the design intent to the project team. We pride ourselves on the details as these communicate the vision to the project team. These drawings are used for permit processing, final pricing and construction.\n\nCONSTRUCTION PHASE SERVICES:\n\nWe will have regular site visits during construction to ensure there is proper execution of the drawings and specifications as well as approve the contractor's applications for payment. Working closely with the contractor enables good communication so we can provide clarification or additional details on the job site and trouble shoot any issues that may arise."
