        "text": "In his 1985 essay “Here Be Dragons,” James Baldwin wrote: “At bottom, what I had learned was that the male desire for a male roams everywhere, avid, desperate, unimaginably lonely.” America’s attitudes toward sexuality, he added, are tragically, inextricably linked with its “ideals” of hyper-masculinity and racialized violence.\n\nA few years later, a gay Black freshman at Brooklyn College named Robert Jones Jr. read that essay and felt a sense of relief. Here was the clearest statement of Black homosexuality and gender fluidity he had ever encountered in writing.\n\nOut on Jan. 5, his debut novel, “The Prophets,” is in many ways a culmination of the homage he’s been paying to Baldwin ever since.

He struggled to find in it any instances of genuine attraction between Black men.\n\n“Even when you get to the Harlem Renaissance, you have these Black queer writers writing very surreptitiously, very quietly about queerness, in between the lines,” he said in a video interview in November from the Bedford-Stuyvesant home he shares with his husband, Adrian Techeira, a lawyer, and their cat, Baldwin. “It’s not until you get to Wallace Thurman, and then eventually James Baldwin, that it’s more open.”\n\nBefore that, the passages Jones did find — in Harriet Jacobs’s “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,” in Toni Morrison’s “Beloved” — all involved Black men being assaulted by white ones. “And I thought, OK,” he said, “but what about love?”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
