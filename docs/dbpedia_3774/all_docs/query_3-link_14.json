        "text": "The Best Poem Of Robert Black\n\nIt Was Dirty When The Nurses Danced\n\nIt was dirty when Tedros told people to travel\n\nIt was dirty when sick people were put next to the old and the vulnerable\n\nIt was dirty when the media lied\n\nIt was dirty when the nurses danced\n\nIt was dirty when death certificates were faked\n\nIt was dirty when Hancock said, 'Test, test, test! '\n\nIt was dirty when they locked down the well\n\nIt was dirty when they let people die alone\n\nIt was dirty when they closed the borders\n\nIt was dirty when they crashed the economies\n\nIt was dirty when Gates said everyone must be vaccinated\n\nIt was dirty when Gates said the next one will get attention this time\n\nIt was dirty when Fauci and The Lancet said hydroxychloroquine was no good\n\nIt was dirty when they used ineffective tests with false positives\n\nIt was dirty when they made the children wear masks\n\nIt was dirty when they put people in isolation\n\nIt was dirty when they enacted laws destroying human rights\n\nIt was dirty when the politicized police arrested people for not wearing a mask\n\nIt was dirty when the politicized police beat innocent protesters in the street\n\nAnd no matter how much they sanitize\n\nThe complicit will never be clean"
