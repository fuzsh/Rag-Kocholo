        "text": "\"A well-told and imaginative work of history that should inform the study of racial violence and the American South for years to come . . . . In addition to writing the definitive history of the 1900 New Orleans Riot, Prince brilliantly pinpoints the ways in which a riot and its repercussions continued to shape race relations in New Orleans and the United States for more than a century.\"—David Godshalk, Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era\n\n“The Ballad of Robert Charles is something new; it forces its reader to reexamine the role of geography, memory, and silence in the project of writing the histories of populations muted by poverty and racism. And for that this work is not only interesting. It is vital.”—Criminal Law and Criminal Justice Books\n\n\"[Prince’s] study of Robert Charles and the social upheaval attached to his name opens new directions for American and southern historians of police power and Black rebellion. . . . Readers will find few heroes or villains in his account, and fewer injunctions. Instead, The Ballad of Robert Charles seeks to understand the manifold violence necessary to maintain white supremacy in America.\"—Agricultural History\n\n\"A powerful, eloquent meditation on what it means to do history, on how the combination of racism, evidentiary silences, and memory conspire to obscure our understanding of the past.\"—Journal of American History\n\n\"The Ballad of Robert Charles tackles a challenging, yet timely, topic. . . . This engaging book reminds us that even in the silences there are lessons to be learned from the past, if we know how to listen.\"—64 Parishes"
