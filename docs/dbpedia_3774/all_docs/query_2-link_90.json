        "text": "THE COURSE\n\nThe newest of all of the golf courses in the CPD Golf portfolio, the history of Robert Black is quite possibly the most interesting.\n\nOnce a private club in 1896, at a location two miles to the east along the shores of Lake Michigan, Robert Black was once the exclusive private five hole golf course named Edgewater Golf Club. In 1910, the golf course moved to its current location. In the 1970’s, the park was redeveloped into split open parkland and the nine hole golf course that is in place today.\n\nElevated tee boxes, greens, and tucked in sand traps all make for a challenging and fun golf experience. Robert Black offers four par 3’s for those who enjoy the challenge of shorter golf holes.\n\nCourse Architect: Killian & Nugent\n\nGreens: Bent Grass\n\nFairways: Rye Grass\n\nClub Rentals: Yes\n\nPractice Facilities: Putting Green\n\nDining Facilities: Sell Bottled Drinks & Packaged Snacks\n\nDress Code: Appropriate Golf Attire"
