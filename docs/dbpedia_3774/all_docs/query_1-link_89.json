        "text": "Robert Stone (born August 21, 1937, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died January 10, 2015, Key West, Florida) was an American author of fiction about individuals in conflict with the decaying late 20th-century Western societies in which they live.\n\nStone served in the U.S. Navy before attending New York (1958–59) and Stanford (1962–64) universities. He wrote advertising copy and newspaper articles and became friends with such writers as Jack Kerouac and Ken Kesey. A Hall of Mirrors (1967), his first novel, revolves around a right-wing radio station in New Orleans and its chaotic “Patriotic Revival”; Stone adapted the book for the screenplay of the film WUSA (1970). His second novel, Dog Soldiers (1974), concerns the legacy of corruption of the Vietnam War. It won the 1975 National Book Award, and Stone cowrote the screenplay for the film adaptation, Who’ll Stop the Rain (1978)."
