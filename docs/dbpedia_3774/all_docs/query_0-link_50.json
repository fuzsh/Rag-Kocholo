        "text": "BAXTER BLACK, a cowboy poet from New Mexico, was born at the Brooklyn Naval Hospital in 1945 while his father Robert was serving in the U.S. Navy. But Robert Black didn’t really want to be in the Navy, he had doctorate in veterinary science, and he brought his wife Theodora, and his four sons to one academic post after another, ending up at New Mexico State in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where Robert was dean of the Ag School.\n\nThere are two kinds of restless: the worried, anxious kind and the eager kind that yearns for novelty. Robert Black was the second. He liked to travel the competitive livestock circuit, judging events and rubbing shoulders with rodeo riders.\n\nBaxter was his oldest son and Robert started bringing Baxter on many of these trips. Baxter saw the men with their cattle, hogs and sheep, the difficulties the animals had with constant travel and the strange way these men bonded with their animals and exploited them, both at the same time.\n\nBy the age of 9, Baxter had his own cow and at 13 he had a horse of his own. He always admired cows, impressed by their vision and their good memory for bad people. At 18, he was president of the local chapter of Future Farmers of America, getting agricultural education and leadership training.\n\nSo Baxter was raised mostly in Las Cruces, New Mexico — but restless, moving around. Then in 1960, Robert Black died of a heart attack.\n\nBaxter started college at New Mexico State, attended for three years without really knowing why, then applied, without a degree, to the Colorado State veterinary sciences doctoral program. Those running the program saw something in him and accepted him. He graduated in 1969.\n\nFor the next 11 years, Baxter was a Simplot Livestock employee in Idaho. He traveled from one ranch to the next, checking on sheep and cattle. He thought he was a good vet, one with stamina and empathy, and calm in a crisis.\n\nHe also enjoyed checking in with cowboys and others who spent their lives around sheep and cattle. He deeply admired the lined and tough old cowboys; they were problem-solvers and storytellers. Baxter’s work was done on the animals but he loved nothing more than meeting these leathery old cowboys and getting their stories.\n\nHe’d started writing simple poems like this one:\n\n“Friend is a word that I don’t throw around.\n\nThough it’s used and abused, I still like the sound.\n\nI save it for people who’ve done right by me.\n\nAnd I know I can count on if ever need be.”\n\nBaxter thought it was obvious that children should grow up “close to the earth.” He’d been a bull rider, he wore cowboy clothes and a big handlebar mustache. He had a grasp of the best in western life and a true fondness for barns, feedlots, holding pens, big skies and sweeping views of the mountains.\n\nHe thought most poetry was far too obscure and — when you could tell what it was about — too sad and serious. He thought poetry should be clear, written to be understood. Like a good conversation, poetry should explore new ground yet put people at ease, should have wisdom in it, and mix optimism with restraint.\n\nIn 1980, he moved to Denver and worked for a pharmaceutical company that paid him to promote its drugs to ranchers and veterinarians. In purely commercial terms, it was a dismal job and at first he found it dreary.\n\nThen he realized that these ranchers and vets would never look forward to seeing him unless he made it very clear that he looked forward to seeing THEM. So he built up a routine of poems, jokes and stories, and he’d slip in a mention of the drugs he was selling almost as an afterthought.\n\nAfter a while, Baxter started bringing his guitar on his rounds and, when he found time, he’d set some cowboy story to music, or make a cowboy story into a poem. He inspired trust and built relationships that way.\n\nBaxter was a pleased and confident person who had firm beliefs and mostly positive thoughts. He liked to equate vegetarianism with evil — but he could abide vegetarians; they were just sorely confused people, and God loved them, too.\n\nHe was certainly not the usual company veterinarian come calling, and people liked and remembered this thin, bow-legged cowboy poet with a gray hat. Many of them encouraged him to keep writing and sharing his poetry.\n\nIn 1982, Baxter Black got laid off by the pharmaceutical company, and he was never a veterinarian or a salesman again. Getting fired was a stiff challenge to his positivity. Like a good bull rider, he took the firing with balance, core strength and a good attitude, and kept sharing his poetry with groups like the North Carolina Cattlemen’s Association and the California Cotton Ginners and Growers Association.\n\nIn 1988, he sent a poem to the national headquarters of National Public Radio. NPR was accustomed to complaints that its stories were generic, and heavily skewed to politics, urban affairs and the East Coast. Here, dropped in their lap, was someone not at all generic: a character, from the rural West.\n\nA few days after Baxter Black sent in his poem, an NPR producer called, asked if they could put it on the air — and did he have any more poems?\n\nBaxter soon learned the kind of poems NPR liked: (“Lightning cracked across the sky like veins across the back of your hand…”) NPR was squeamish about the raw side of outdoor life, for instance the comical uses of cow shit, so he saved “cowy” poems for his live shows.\n\nBlack started reciting his cowboy poetry on National Public Radio. And if he wasn’t really a cowboy… well, neither was John Wayne, but people sure loved seeing John Wayne in the saddle. Same with Baxter Black at the microphone. The radio producers knew he didn’t round up horses and go on cattle drives and most radio listeners knew it, too. But he faked it convincingly; he sounded the way a lot of people in cities and towns wanted cowboys to sound.\n\nIn time, Black was given the green light to offer not just poems but commentary on rural matters. As long as he kept it playful, NPR producers and listeners seemed to enjoy his folksy putdowns of the “cosmopolitan East.”\n\nNewspapers began profiling Baxter Black with headlines like “Write’em Cowboy” and “Poem on the Range.” A few called him America’s “Poet Lariat.” He got his own column, “On the Edge of Common Sense,” which, at its height, appeared in over 100 newspapers.\n\nIn time, Baxter was doing 150 appearances a year and had his own radio show. He appeared several times on “The Tonight Show” with Johnny Carson. He wrote over 30 books — some poetry collections, some adult fiction, some children’s literature. Drama, fantasy, folklore, it didn’t matter. Words rolled off of this man.\n\nOne of the things Baxter knew in his bones, as a westerner, was the long distances that so many westerners drive. So he was pleased to be able to make cassette tapes of his poems and commentaries so that drivers and long-haul truckers had a friendly voice on those long drives.\n\nAround 2015, Baxter Black began to suffer heavily from dementia. He kept writing his column through December of 2021, but in 2022 he had to give it up and, later that year, he died at 77, at his ranch outside Benson, Arizona.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from one of his poems, “I Know You’ll Miss This Man”:\n\n“The Lord spoke to the heavy hearts that stood with hats in hand\n\n‘Your sadness pains me deeply and I know you’ll miss this man\n\nBut it’s true what you’ve been hearing, Heaven is a real place\n\nThat’s no small consolation — you should use that fact to face\n\nThe emptiness his parting left that seeps into your bones\n\nAnd draws on it to ease your pain, for he is not alone…\n\nSo I offer this small comfort to put your grief to rest\n\nI only take the top hands ’cause my crew’s the very best\n\nAnd I know if might seem selfish to friends and next of kin\n\nBut I needed one more cowboy, and Buster fit right in.”"
