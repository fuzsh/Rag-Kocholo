        "text": "The Eisenhower Foundation's mission is to honor and champion the relevance today of the life and leadership of Dwight D. Eisenhower through compelling programs and events that celebrate his legacy.\n\nThe Eisenhower Foundation non-profit was formed in 1945 after the Allied victory in Europe. The Boyhood Home was opened in 1947 and the Museum in 1954 by the Foundation. Public and private entities raised $3.5 million to build the Presidential Library which opened in 1962. Today, five buildings on 22 acres comprise the campus â€“ the Presidential Library, Presidential Museum, Boyhood Home, Visitors Center and Place of Meditation."
