        "text": "Honestly, this game is great! I have always been a person who likes games that have a lot of plot and storyline, and this game definitely checks those boxes. Making your way through your years at hogwarts, you make friends and enemies, increase your magical knowledge, and stumble upon some secrets along the way.\n\nThe energy, however, can be frustrating at times. I never spend money on games, so sometimes itâs hard for me to complete classes or story parts. Also, once study sessions are introduced, the game gets a little frustrating. But, donât worry! I struggled with that too because I was like âomg I hate these so much!â Because they really donât do anything. But developers, can I just say how much better it is when you make the study sessions 6 stars instead of 9?! Even when you have multiple classes to complete, for me it just took a lot of irritation away. I would really appreciate it if you kept it as 6 stars for study sessions. It would be great, because progressing through the story is always so fun to me.\n\nIf you ever end up ditching the game because it is just too annoying with the energy and study sessions, I recommend going back in and giving it another try because I did that for multiple weeks but now itâs much more fun. You kind of just have to be patient and persevering at some points, but once you do, Hogwarts Mystery is a blast for people who really enjoy being in the wizarding world!\n\n(Sorry for making this so long! ð )\n\ni love this game so much and i am obsessed with it. i love how you can do side quests and be on the quidditch team and it has a different story than the main one and it doesnât change what happens in the main story. the only thing i would change about the game is the amount of time you have to wait to get energy. four minutes is a lot of time to wait for ONE energy. if youâre gonna make the wait time that long, at least make the amount of time you can do the class or whatever it is youâre doing at the time. or make it like âwait four minutes and get two energyâ or whatever. another thing is the waiting time for tasks. iâll wait eight hours to do a task and iâll do that task in five minutes and then have to wait another eight hours to do the next task. i know itâs good so that you donât finish the game in a day or something but you wouldnât even be able to anyways cause you have to wait four minutes to get energy. i love this game so much and have read all the harry potter books so i love that this game is set before the time of harry potter and that youâre in charlie weasleys year, (I LOVE IT SO MUCH CAUSE CHARLIE IS A BOSS) and i also love how you can do whatever you want to do and i just love this game so much. i DEFINITELY recommend getting this game. you wonât waste your time getting this. (and itâs free so itâs even better). i love this game so much. thank you for making it. whoever made this: youâre my hero.\n\nThis game is perfect! I am addicted to the story because each chapter is a new adventure! Donât get me wrong, but the timed events that you must finish have awesome stuff in them, especially when you get the prize at the end. But, the only thing is, the timed events NEVER even GIVE you enough time to finish them, and you guys are the one who makes the energy the biggest problem, no offense. Either you guys fix the energy problem, or do not make the timed events timed, otherwise I would have second thoughts on a five-star review. Maybe you can make 1 energy every 1 second! Hahaha jk. But please fix this, this is a wonderful, addictive game and it would make it even better if we have enough time to finish all the wonderful tasks and adventures that you have for us! For a better experience for the Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery players, such as myself, please put my statements into thought. I know how hard it is to fix glitches every day, and to work with picky people. Please do not put me in that category, because I just want the game to be better so you guys would be successful! Thank you for your time and patients. It makes me really happy to know that you have read my improvement statements.\n\nThank You for This Wonderful Game And Adventurous Journey That You Made for Me And All The Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery Players! Iâm Sure That We All LOVE This Game! Once Again, Thank You!"
