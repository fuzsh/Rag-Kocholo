        "text": "Why are Harry Potter video games so popular?\n\nJust like the novels, Harry Potter video games have a special magical ability to grasp the attention of their target audience. Diving into the Wizarding World, created by J.K. Rowling and visualized by Warner Bros, kids, and their parents could watch and awe at the magnificence of Hogwarts Castle, gush over spectacular spells, and hold their breath at dramatic plot twists. However, Harry Potter PC games are capable of delivering the experience not a single book or DVD is capable of delivering. Of course, we’re talking about the active experience. As much as people loved reading and watching the stories from the Harry Potter franchise, walking down the corridors and exploring the Forbidden Forest by yourself feels much more impactful. Who wouldn't love to swing a wand and cast spells? Harry Potter games on PC grant such a degree of immersion that not a single mean modern of entertainment can compete with it.\n\nList of all Harry Potter video games\n\nWondering what the Wizarding World has to offer for Potterhead gamers? Here’s the complete list of Harry Potter video games. As you can see, the collection is pretty extensive and is sparse across various platforms.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PC, Mac, PS1, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, GBC, and GBA)\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PC, Mac, PS1, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, GBC, and GBA)\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (PC, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, and GBA)\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PSP, Nintendo DS, and GBA)\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (PC, Mac, PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, Nintendo DS and GBA, and Mobile)\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (PC, Mac, PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, Nintendo DS, and Mobile)\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, and Mobile)\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS, and Mobile)\n\nApart from the main series, there is a number of titles set in the Harry Potter franchise. With LEGO interpretations, spin-offs and prequels, the collection gets significantly longer Therefore, the complete list of Harry Potter video games should also include the following titles:\n\nLego Creator: Harry Potter\n\nLego Creator: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nHarry Potter: Quidditch World Cup\n\nLego Harry Potter: Years 1–4\n\nLego Harry Potter: Years 5–7\n\nHarry Potter for Kinect\n\nBook of Spells\n\nBook of Potions\n\nLego Dimensions: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Story Pack\n\nLego Dimensions: Harry Potter Team Pack\n\nLego Dimensions: Tina Fun Pack\n\nFantastic Beast VR\n\nHarry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery\n\nHarry Potter: Wizards Unite\n\nHogwarts Legacy\n\nWhy are there so few Harry Potter PC games available?\n\nAs GG.deals is a price comparison website for PC titles, visitors will be able to find only a few Harry Potter PC games on this page. Even the ones visible are available only in keyshops. Unfortunately, that’s due to the fact that all those installments that were previously available in official distribution lost the rights to use the original IP. Whenever a company plans to create more Harry Potter video games, they have to pay copyright fees to use the intellectual property. The right is time-limited, as any agreement expires after 10 years. That was the deal between the IP owners and Electronic Arts which created the vast majority of titles. In the end, since old games would not bring any revenue, EA decided not to prologue the copyright agreement and revoked titles from distribution.\n\nWho currently owns the rights to Harry Potter games?\n\nThe Harry Potter games series seems like a desired but hard-to-reach fruit for the developers and other content makers. At the moment, anyone who'd like to create a new installment will have to negotiate a deal with J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc, a.k.a. the owners of the rights to the franchise. As we can see from the example of Electronic Arts, just because you created and published the game about The Boy Who Lived does not mean you have the legal right to distribute it.\n\nWhat is considered the best Harry Potter game?\n\nIt is universally agreed that the very first installments are considered to be the best Harry Potter games. Those old-school platformers with simple controls and beloved characters did a fantastic job targeting its market. Regrettably, we will not be able to revisit them, and even if we could, we doubt it will be as fun as 20 years ago. Screenshots from the Philosopher’s Stone game became memes due to their wonky looks, which is not a good sign.\n\nHowever, it seems like the title of the best Harry Potter game is about to go to Hogwarts History, which is ironic. The production is set in the 1800s, making it impossible to meet the main protagonist of the series. Nonetheless, it manages to intrigue grown-up Potterheaqds who’ve been dreaming of an action RPG set in their favorite fairytale. If you don’t mind reliving the known story with humor and yellow blocks, then we strongly recommend LEGO titles. Those are considered the perfect pick of Harry Potter games on PC to play with children."
