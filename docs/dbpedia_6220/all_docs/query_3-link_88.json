        "text": "Also available on: Xbox 360, PS3, PS2, PSP, DS, PC\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nDeveloper: EA Bright Light Studio\n\nPublisher: Electronic Arts\n\nRelease date: July 3, 2009\n\nWhile the summer signals a dry spell for gardeners and gamers, moviegoers are spoilt for choice with a feast of blockbusters hitting the silver screen. Digital Spy has already been fortunate enough to watch and review some of the summer's finest films, while the gaming team has been busy playing through a selection of the much derided and dreaded movie spinoffs. It's not been all bad though, the Transformers game was decent, despite a few problems, Ice Age 3 made some really positive steps in the right direction, while Wolverine and co. triumphed in X-Men Origins.\n\nWith the summer's biggest and most anticipated movie almost upon us, now is the time for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to cast its spell on gamers and provide the magical experience the franchise has been lacking on the computer screen.\n\nFrom a gameplay point of view, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince features a number of what are essentially minigames, set against the backdrop of a typical year at Hogwarts. Players must mix potions, duel with friends and foes and still manage to show up for Quidditch practice and games.\n\nUnfortunately, the games themselves are of a poor quality, and really fail to flesh out the title in any significant way. Quidditch, which is the first game you'll experience while on the Weasleys' farm, is simply a matter of pointing the Wii Remote at the screen and guiding Potter, or whoever else it may be, through a series of stars, with each star passed through leaving you closer to catching the Golden Snitch. As if simply pointing in the direction of the stars wasn't easy enough, the game automatically changes your flight path to ensure you're at least heading in the right direction, meaning that the challenge of passing through the checkpoints is lessened considerably. The game fails to capture the perceived excitement of playing Quidditch, with players feeling no sense of danger whatsoever while playing this hazardous, high-flying sport.\n\nThe duelling is another area of the game that fails to inspire. Players will square off against friends and schoolmates in the duelling club, or against rivals and full-blown enemies while making their way through Hogwarts itself. The duelling plays out like a magical version of Street Fighter, with players squaring off in one-on-one battles over three rounds during official club rules, or until the opponent's energy bar is depleted elsewhere. Both attack and defence spells can be used to vanquish your foes, with spellcasting achieved by motioning with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. What could (and should) have been the game's focal point and saving grace, turns into yet another disappointing aspect of a poor game. The spells can be difficult to pull off, not because of any complicated motions, but because the motion recognition isn't all that it's cracked up to be. The defensive shield spell works very well, while certain spells don't always register, which becomes a little frustrating. The duels are also quite easy to conquer, due to the fact that a quck tap of the A button dodges just about anything, while knocking your opponent down means that you can unleash multiple stupefy spells to drain their energy bar.\n\nEasily the most enjoyable game featured in The Half-Blood Prince comes in the form of potion mixing. Using the Wii Remote, players must combine a number of liquid and solid ingredients together to form some of the series' trademark weird and wonderful concoctions. By following a number of on-screen instructions, players can select an ingredient by pointing at it and pressing A, which is then followed by lifting and pouring with the motion controls. The temperature of the potion also plays an important part, with players forced to heat up the mixture by shaking the Remote and Nunchuk to fan the flames. In order to succeed, the potion must turn a certain colour, with any form of overfill/heating resulting in a big cloud of purple gas, which needs to be waved away with both hands. The game also imposes a fairly strict time limit, which results in the potion section offering the closest thing to a challenge in a game lacking in difficulty.\n\nThe rest of the game is spent traversing the grounds of Hogwarts, which looks fantastic. Hogwarts has been very well recreated, as have the characters themselves, with the actors' likenesses used for authenticity (despite many not lending their vocal talents). Unfortunately, controlling the characters is extremely cumbersome, with the exploration of Hogwarts ruined by clunky movements. Also, despite Hogwarts looking the part, it does feel as though moving from A to B is a cheap tactic used by the developers to make the game feel as though it has more depth than it actually has. The audio is another area that fluctuates between the extremes, with an excellent musical score offset against some appalling Resident Evil-style voice dubbing. The jerky voice work (which isn't the fault of the actors) also spills into the storytelling, with anyone who may not be familiar with the story likely to remain in the dark thanks to some vague and oddly-placed cut-scenes.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince really is the epitome of the lacklustre and inferior movie/video game tie-in. The game is an absolute mess, from the dodgy storytelling to the minimal gaming moments themselves. With the exception of the mildly enjoyable potion mixing, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince really does make a muggle of anybody unfortunate/dedicated enough to shell out for this title. With the same intensity that Harry and friends spend their time battling 'He Who Shall Not Be Named', gamers should avoid 'This Which Should Not Have Been Released' and pray that EA goes back to the drawing board for the two-part finale yet to come."
