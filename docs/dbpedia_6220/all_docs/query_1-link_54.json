Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth book in the overarching Potter world will get games on all platforms; more interesting to PS Fanboys, the titles will be on the PS3 and PSP. Details on the Half-Blood Prince games were scarce; all that's really known right now is that they will follow the events of the upcoming movie. Speaking of which, the film is expected for a November 21, 2008 release. It follows that the games should be ready by November as well.[Via press release]",
