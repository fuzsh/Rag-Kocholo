For now you have only two solutions: Virtual Machine with Windows Vista, or a dual-boot system Windows 10 and 7.\n\nThe disc is SecuROM protected and Windows 10 blocks the old protections drivers (SecuROM, Safedisc, TAGES, StarForce), rendering our legally bought games useless. MS said that they will restore the backward compatibility (after the customer outrage), but so far, nothing concrete. So your solutions are to have a Virtual machine with an older Windows installed, or a dual boot system with two separate OS.\n\nMy \"love\" for MS knows no bounds. Removing the ability of playing my legally purchased discs is an insult. And they even suggested that we should use pirate workarounds..\n\nTheir words...\n\nP.S.: EA can't release the game in the digital format as the license is now with Warner and EA can't publish the Harry Potter games anymore. They can't publish, remaster or modify without Warner's permission. J.K. Rowlings went to the highest bidder when the contract with EA expired and EA could not and can not compete with a media giant like Warner. So, sadly, the best HP games are not available for sale anywhere now and i am less than thrilled with how Warner is treating the HP franchise. In their minds, the HP is only a kid franchise, hence, they only have those Lego Harry Potter games and nothing else of note (compared with a rather impressive list of games developed by EA, most being decent to great).\n\nI do not work for EA and i am not associated with the company in any way. I am a player just like you, trying to help wherever i can.I will not answer to any unsolicited PM.\n\n@Weezie962 Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 had updates that are blocking the protection drivers, preventing them to install themselves from the discs. This is not on EA, but on MS.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the Harry Potter license is now with Warner and EA can't release the games digitally and offer a digital replacement for the titles released on the discs. They can't remaster the old games, update them and so on, as they don't have Warner's agreement to do that.\n\nA lot of us would like to see the HP games in the digital format, either in the original form or as remasters. Sadly that isn't possible, due to the fact that when the contract between EA and JK Rawlings expired, EA could not compete against a media giant like Warner. So, Warner got the license and does nothing with it. Warner used the IP so far only for their Lego series and some rather underwhelming mobile games. I hope that the contract with Warner is on set time period and JK Rawlings will grant the license again to the people that actually did something with it and not to someone that just sits on it.\n\nI do not work for EA and i am not associated with the company in any way.

Get to the game install file on the CD - Its called Autorun.exe - Right Click it... Click Properties > Go to Compatibility Tab\n\n2. At Compatiblity Tab > Select Vista SP2 (Check the box > run this program in compatiblity mode for)\n\n3. Let all the game files install (and make sure you tick put icon on desktop)\n\n4. When you have the game installed AND an icon on the desktop - Right Click on the HARRY POTTER desktop icon > Click Properties > Go to Compatiblity Tab\n\n5. At Compatiblity Tab > Select Vista SP2 (again)\n\n6. Select run in 640 x 480 screen resolution < dont worry this seems low rez, the game looks great at this rez.\n\n7. Select Run as administrator > Apply > EXIT\n\nWhy this works: This game was released in 2009 when VISTA and XP were still being used. These were 32bit environments.\n\nAs long as Windows 7 knows the game is in compatibility mode for VISTA, it runs like a dream- Enjoy this great game!\n\n@nbwriter Nope, not gonna work on Windows 10. As i have explained, MS blocked the installation of the old protection drivers. And the game is Safedisc protected, which means that it needs to install the protection drivers from the disc . And you won't be able to do that.\n\nAs for the method that you have described, it will work only if you did not updated the Windows 7/8/8.1 since 2015. You can remove the security update from those three OS, as described here\n\nSo unless you have a 2015 build for those three, pre-security update, to reinstall, or you did not updated them since, you are able to play your old games. Otherwise, you will have to jump through hoops to make it work again.\n\nWindows 10 is by its nature barred from the old games, unless they are DRM free or if you are using a certain yarr copy (for a game you've paid for, goodies). So you have only two options Virtual Machine or dual boot system. And even with that, it depends on which CPU you have, as Windows 8.1 or lower can't run on the last two Intel generations (Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake), nor on the recent AMD Ryzen. No driver support, no support from MS for those new CPU's on Windows lower than Win10.\n\nI do not work for EA and i am not associated with the company in any way.
