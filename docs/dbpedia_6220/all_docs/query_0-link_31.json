        "text": "2005 fantasy novel by J. K. Rowling\n\n\"Halfblood\" redirects here. For other uses, see Halfblood (disambiguation).\n\n\"Half-Blood Prince\" redirects here. For the film based on the novel, see Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film). For the character nicknamed the Half-Blood Prince, see Severus Snape.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of the boy wizard's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore.\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold almost seven million copies in the first 24 hours after its release,[1] a record eventually broken by its sequel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[2] There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right-to-read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 British Book of the Year award.\n\nReviewers noted that the book had a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nNew Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, meets with the Muggle prime minister to discuss recent wizarding events affecting the non-magical world. Meanwhile, Harry, who has spent the summer grieving his late godfather, Sirius Black, is escorted by Dumbledore to the Weasleys' home. En route, they visit retired Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn, who agrees to resume his former post after seeing the famous Harry Potter. Elsewhere, Severus Snape is visited by Bellatrix Lestrange and her sister Narcissa Malfoy. Narcissa worries for Draco's life, and convinces Snape to make an Unbreakable Vow to protect Draco at Hogwarts.\n\nWhile out shopping for school supplies, Harry, Ron, and Hermione spy Draco enquiring about suspicious artefacts inside the notorious shop, Borgin and Burkes, in Knockturn Alley. Later, Draco claims he may not return to Hogwarts the following year, leading Harry to suspect he has become a Death Eater. During the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, Slughorn is introduced as the Potions teacher, replacing Snape who takes over Defence Against the Dark Arts. Having failed to shop for Potions supplies, Harry and Ron use borrowed old textbooks for Slughorn's first class. Harry finds a tattered book bearing the inscription, 'The Half-Blood Prince', which contains helpful tips and spells scribbled in its margins. With it, Harry becomes an expert brewer. He rises to the top of the class, and wins a vial of Felix Felicis, a luck-enhancing potion, after completing a difficult assignment.\n\nDumbledore prepares Harry for his foretold battle with Voldemort by educating him about Voldemort's past as Tom Riddle. At school, Riddle had consulted with Slughorn over ancient magic called 'horcruxes', but Dumbledore wishes to see the original memory. He tasks Harry with retrieving it from Slughorn. Failing to corner Slughorn after potions classes, Harry grudgingly accepts to join the Slug Club, an informal group created by Slughorn of his famous, talented and well-connected students. Hermione and Ginny are also Slug Club invitees. Ron feels left out, but Hermione invites him to go with her to Slughorn's Christmas party. He agrees, but makes out with Lavender Brown during a victory party for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Harry develops a secret crush on Ginny, but is forced to observe her with her new boyfriend, Dean Thomas. After Slughorn's party, Harry overhears Draco and Snape having a heated argument in the school corridors. He confides to Arthur and Lupin over the winter break, but they brush off his suspicion about Draco working for Voldemort, also reminding Harry that Dumbledore trusts Snape.\n\nReturning to Hogwarts, Ron is admitted to the infirmary after being poisoned. Hermione visits him in the hospital, bringing an abrupt end to his relationship with Lavender. Harry discards the Prince's textbook in the Room of Requirement, after one of its scribbled spells almost kills Draco when Harry uses it on him. Harry successfully obtains Slughorn's unaltered memory by using Felix Felicis. The enhanced luck also causes Ginny to break up with Dean, allowing Harry to start seeing her instead. Slughorn's memory confirms Dumbledore's theory that Voldemort created multiple Horcruxes, artefacts that encase one's soul, in his quest to attain immortality. The memory alludes to six soul-fragments (seventh being Voldemort himself), though Dumbledore confirms two Horcruxes are already destroyed and four still remain. He asks Harry to accompany him to retrieve another.\n\nJourneying to a remote cave, Harry and Dumbledore overcome numerous protective enchantments before retrieving a Locket Horcrux. Dumbledore is severely weakened by the effort, and demands Snape's intervention on returning to Hogwarts. Atop the Astronomy tower, he notices a trap and immobilizes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak. Draco shows up with other Death Eaters, who snuck into the castle in Dumbledore's absence. Draco falters with his task to kill Dumbledore, but Snape shows up. Fulfilling his vow to Narcissa, he casts the Killing Curse on Dumbledore and sends him falling off the tower. Draco and Snape escape, being given chase by Harry, who is released from Dumbledore's protection. Harry tries battling Snape, but is easily overcome. Snape brags about creating many of Harry's attack spells, revealing himself as the 'Half-Blood Prince' (Snape's mother was Eileen Prince and his father a Muggle, making Snape a 'half-blood'). He and Draco escape. Harry finds the locket horcrux on Dumbledore's body, and opens it, but it is revealed to be a fake. A note inside by 'R.A.B.' claims it was switched by someone who also discovered Voldemort's secret.\n\nDumbledore's funeral at Hogwarts is attended by representatives from all magical races. Harry regrets that Dumbledore died in vain, but resolves to finish the task of tracking down the Horcruxes. Ron and Hermione vow to accompany him.\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nFranchise\n\n[edit]\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth book in the Harry Potter series.[3] The first book in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997, with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries.[4] By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[5] The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was initially published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.[7] Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[7] Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[8] Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the longest novel in the Harry Potter series, was released 2 April 2003.[9] After the publishing of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the seventh and final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released 21 July 2007.[10] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[11]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nRowling stated that she had Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince \"planned for years,\" but she spent two months revisiting her plan before she began writing the story's first draft. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for Goblet of Fire and had to rewrite an entire third of the book.[12] She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him.[13] The first chapter, \"The Other Minister\", which features meetings between the Muggle Prime Minister, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix, but she found \"it finally works\" in Half-Blood Prince.[14] She stated that she was \"seriously upset\" writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was the hardest to write.[15] When asked if she liked the book, she responded, \"I like it better than I liked Goblet, Phoenix or Chamber when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!\"[16]\n\nRowling revealed the title of Half-Blood Prince on her website on 24 June 2004.[17] This was the title she had once considered for the second book, Chamber of Secrets, though she decided the information disclosed belonged later on in the story.[18] On 21 December 2004, she announced she had finished writing it, along with the release date of 16 July.[19][20] Bloomsbury unveiled the cover on 8 March 2005.[21]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe record-breaking publication of Half-Blood Prince was accompanied by controversy. In May 2005, bookmakers in the UK suspended bets on which main character would die in the book amid fears of insider knowledge. A number of high-value bets were made on the death of Albus Dumbledore, many coming from the town of Bungay where it was believed the books were being printed at the time. Betting was later reopened.[22] Additionally, in response to Greenpeace's campaign on using forest friendly paper for big-name authors, Bloomsbury published the book on 30% recycled paper.[23]\n\nRight-to-read controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early July 2005, a Real Canadian Superstore in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, accidentally sold fourteen copies of The Half-Blood Prince before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, Raincoast Books, obtained an injunction from the Supreme Court of British Columbia that prohibited the purchasers from reading the books before the official release date or discussing the contents.[24] Purchasers were offered Harry Potter T-shirts and autographed copies of the book if they returned their copies before 16 July.[24]\n\nOn 15 July, less than twelve hours before the book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned The Globe and Mail newspaper that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, would be seen as a violation of the trade secret injunction. The injunction sparked a number of news articles alleging that the injunction had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog.[25] Richard Stallman called for a boycott and requested the publisher issue an apology.[26] The Globe and Mail published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning.[27] Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.[28]\n\nStyle and themes\n\n[edit]\n\nSome reviewers noted that Half-Blood Prince contained a darker tone than the previous Potter novels. The Christian Science Monitor's reviewer Yvonne Zipp argued the first half contained a lighter tone to soften the unhappy ending.[29] The Boston Globe reviewer Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"lightness [is] slimmer than ever in this darkening series...[there is] a new charge of gloom and darkness. I felt depressed by the time I was two-thirds of the way through.\" She also compared the setting to Charles Dickens's depictions of London as it was \"brooding, broken, gold-lit, as living a character as any other.\"[30] Christopher Paolini called the darker tone \"disquieting\" because it was so different from the earlier books.[31] Liesl Schillinger, a contributor to The New York Times book review, also noted that Half-Blood Prince was \"far darker\" but \"leavened with humor, romance and snappy dialogue.\" She suggested a connection to the 11 September attacks, as the later, darker novels were written after that event.[32] David Kipen, a critic of the San Francisco Chronicle, considered the \"darkness as a sign of our paranoid times\" and singled out curfews and searches that were part of the tightened security at Hogwarts as resemblances to our world.[33]\n\nJulia Keller, a critic for the Chicago Tribune, highlighted the humour found in the novel and claimed it to be the success of the Harry Potter saga. She acknowledged that \"the books are dark and scary in places\" but \"no darkness in Half-Blood Prince...is so immense that it cannot be rescued by a snicker or a smirk.\" She considered that Rowling was suggesting difficult times can be worked through with imagination, hope, and humour and compared this concept to works such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows.[34]\n\nRosenberg wrote that the two main themes of Half-Blood Prince were love and death and praised Rowling's \"affirmation of their central position in human lives.\" She considered love to be represented in several forms: the love of parent to child, teacher to student, and the romances that developed between the main characters.[30] Zipp noted trust and redemption to be themes promising to continue in the final book, which she thought \"would add a greater layer of nuance and complexity to some characters who could sorely use it.\"[29] Deepti Hajela also pointed out Harry's character development, that he was \"no longer a boy wizard; he's a young man, determined to seek out and face a young man's challenges.\"[35] Paolini had similar views, claiming, \"the children have changed...they act like real teenagers.\"[31]\n\nPublication and reception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Metacritic, the book received a 77 out of 100 based on 23 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[36] Liesl Schillinger of The New York Times praised the novel's various themes and suspenseful ending. However, she considered Rowling's gift \"not so much for language as for characterisation and plotting.\"[32] Kirkus Reviews said it \"will leave readers pleased, amused, excited, scared, infuriated, delighted, sad, surprised, thoughtful and likely wondering where Voldemort has got to, since he appears only in flashbacks.\" They considered Rowling's \"wry wit\" to turn into \"outright merriment\" but called the climax \"tragic, but not uncomfortably shocking.\"[37] Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor praised the way Rowling evolved Harry into a teenager and how the plot threads found as far back as Chamber of Secrets came into play. On the other hand, she noted it \"gets a little exposition-heavy in spots,\" and older readers may have seen the ending coming.[29]\n\nThe Boston Globe correspondent Liz Rosenberg wrote, \"The book bears the mark of genius on every page\" and praised the imagery and darker tone of the book, considering that the series could be crossing over from fantasy to horror.[30] The Associated Press writer Deepti Hajela praised the newfound emotional tones and ageing Harry to the point at which \"younger fans may find [the series] has grown up too much.\"[35] Emily Green, a staff writer for the Los Angeles Times, was generally positive about the book but was concerned whether young children could handle the material.[38] Cultural critic Julia Keller of the Chicago Tribune called it the \"most eloquent and substantial addition to the series thus far\" and considered the key to the success of the Potter novels to be humour.[34]\n\nAwards and honours\n\n[edit]\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince won several awards, including the 2006 British Book of the Year Award[39] and the 2006 Royal Mail Award for Scottish Children's Books for ages 8–12 in its native United Kingdom.[40] In the United States, the American Library Association listed it among its 2006 Best Books for Young Adults.[41] It won both the 2005 reader-voted Quill Awards for Best Book of the Year and Best Children's Book.[42][43] It also won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Seal for notable book.[44]\n\nSales\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore publication, 1.4 million pre-orders were placed for Half-Blood Prince on Amazon.com, breaking the record held by the previous novel, Order of the Phoenix, with 1.3 million.[45] The initial print run for Half-Blood Prince was a record-breaking 10.8 million.[46] Within the first 24 hours after release, the book sold 9 million copies worldwide: 2 million in the UK and about 6.9 million in the US,[47] which prompted Scholastic to rush an additional 2.7 million copies into print.[48] Within the first nine weeks of publication, 11 million copies of the US edition were reported to have been sold.[49] The US audiobook, read by Jim Dale, set sales records with 165,000 sold over two days, besting the adaptation of Order of the Phoenix by twenty percent.[50]\n\nTranslations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Harry Potter in translation\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.[51] Along with the rest of the books in the Harry Potter series, it was eventually translated into 67 languages.[52] However, because of high security surrounding the manuscript, translators did not get to start on translating Half-Blood Prince until its English release date, and the earliest were not expected to be released until the fall of 2005.[53] In Germany, a group of \"hobby translators\" translated the book via the internet less than two days after release, long before German translator Klaus Fritz could translate and publish the book.[54]\n\nEditions\n\n[edit]\n\nSince its wide hardcover release on 16 July 2005, Half-Blood Prince was released as a paperback on 23 June 2006 in the UK.[55] Two days later on 25 July, the paperback edition was released in Canada[56] and the US, where it had an initial print run of 2 million copies.[57] To celebrate the release of the American paperback edition, Scholastic held a six-week sweepstakes event in which participants in an online poll were entered to win prizes.[58] Simultaneous to the original hardcover release was the UK adult edition that featured a new cover[59] and was also released as a paperback on 23 June.[60] Also released on 16 July was the Scholastic \"Deluxe Edition,\" which featured reproductions of Mary GrandPré's artwork and had a print run of about 100,000 copies.[61] Bloomsbury later released a paperback \"Special Edition\" on 6 July 2009[62] and a \"Signature Edition\" paperback on 1 November 2010.[63]\n\nAdaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film adaptation of the sixth book was originally scheduled to be released on 21 November 2008 but was changed to 15 July 2009.[64][65] Directed by David Yates, the screenplay was adapted by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman and David Barron.[66] The film grossed over $934 million worldwide,[67] which made it the second-highest-grossing film of 2009 worldwide[68] and the fifteenth-highest of all time.[69] Additionally, Half-Blood Prince gained an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.[70][71]\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nA video game adaptation of the book was developed by EA Bright Light Studio and published by Electronic Arts in 2009. The game was available on the Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox 360, and macOS platforms.\n\nThe book was also adapted in the 2011 video game Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNovels portal"
