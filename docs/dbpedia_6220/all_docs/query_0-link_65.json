        "text": "Harry PotterDeveloper(s)Publisher(s)Electronic Arts, Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentYear introduced2001Genre(s)Action-adventure, Shooter\n\nHarry Potter is a series of video games based on the movie series of the same name. The movies, in turn, are based on the book series by J.K. Rowling, a British author. The games were mostly tie-ins with the movies, with the basic plot and world of the games taken directly from the films. However, there have also been a few games to break this trend. For example, Quidditch World Cup is a sports game bases on the fictional sport of Quidditch, which is portrayed throughout the books and movies. That said, the fact that the movie series has ended has cast the future of the game series into doubt, although more games are confirmed to be in development.\n\nHarry Potter is a low fantasy series starring a young wizard of the same name. Generally speaking, the series follows the boy's trials and tribulations as he attends the Magical School of Hogwarts. His most distinguishing feature is a cursed scar on his forehead shaped like a lightning bolt, the remnant of an attack by the Dark Lord Voldemort when he was an infant. Voldemort, arguably the most powerful character in the franchise, is the series's chief antagonist, even after being defeated before the events of the series.\n\nIn general, the Harry Potter games have generally received average reviews, especially the movie tie-ins. The most critically acclaimed entry of the series was LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, which received scores around 8/10 from many critics. Conversely, some of the Harry Potter games have been trashed, particularly Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2.\n\nDue largely to the attached brand, the Harry Potter games have sold millions of copies. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on the PlayStation, for instance, sold over 3.7 million units on its own. Individual million sellers also appeared on the PS2, Wii, Xbox 360, GBA, and DS.\n\nGames[edit | edit source]\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, released in 2001 for PlayStation.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (PC), released in 2001 for Windows, and released again in 2002 for Mac.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Game Boy Color), released in 2001 for Game Boy Color.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Game Boy Advance), released in 2001 for Game Boy Advance.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2003), released in 2003 for GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, released in 2002 for PlayStation.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PC), released in 2002 for Windows, and released again in 2003 for Mac.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Game Boy Color), released in 2002 for Game Boy Color.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Game Boy Advance), released in 2002 for Game Boy Advance.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (console), released in 2002 for GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, released in 2004 for GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (PC), released in 2004 for Windows.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Game Boy Advance), released in 2004 for Game Boy Advance.\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, released in 2005 for GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PlayStation Portable, and Windows.\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (handheld), released in 2005 for Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, released in 2007 for Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable, Windows, and Mac.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (handheld), released in 2007 for Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (mobile), released in 2007 for Mobile Phones.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, released in 2009 for Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows, and Mac.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (handheld), released in 2009 for Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (mobile), released in 2009 for Mobile Phones.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"
