        "text": "Get set for the third Harry Potter mobile game from EA Mobile. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is coming our way this Autumn, to tie in with the blockbuster movie of the same name.\n\nIt's coming out for every gaming format, with mobile making the list. The game description may apply to console rather than mobile, but for the record, it involves Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, and a mixture of wizard duels, potion-brewing, and Quidditch.\n\nOh, and Ron Weasley's 'romantic entanglements' too, which is nice. Expect the game to stick fairly closely to the plot of the film, which means you'll know what's going to happen if you've read the book."
