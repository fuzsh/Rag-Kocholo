Gameplay[]

Wii[]

The game utilises the Wii Remote features as it did in the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix video game.[1]. But unlike the previous game, players can now also use the motion sensing and vibration features to brew potions. Potion brewing involves following a complex recipe one step at a time. The steps include picking up vials of liquid, shaking them (by shaking the Wii Remote) until they froth, and tipping the Wii Remote to pour it into the mixture, being very careful not to pour in too much. Another possible step is stirring the mixture with the Wii Remote until it changes colour. If it starts vibrating, that is the sign to move away before it blows up.[2]

Harry Potter can duel against Draco Malfoy in a Duelling Room with a long platform, similar to the one seen in the second film, but wider to allow dodging of spells. Moving in order to dodge is done with the Nunchuk Control Stick, while casting spells is done with Wii Remote and Nunchuk gestures. Combat spells currently implemented include a shield spell ("Protego") cast by crossing the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, a standard attack spell by striking downwards with the Wii Remote ("Stupefy"), a charged version by holding the Wii Remote up for longer first, and a more powerful attack spell by swinging the Wii Remote and Nunchuck to the left.[2] There is also Quidditch & 2-player Duelling.

The game follows the film nearly word for word but misses out on some points from the book, just like the film did. First the player follows a story mode type of play and completes missions, but after Dumbledore's death, there is free time to finish potions, complete Quidditch trials and practise duelling with the Gryffindor's, Hufflepuff's, Ravenclaw's and Slytherins.

Nintendo DS[]

In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the Stylus is used, once again, for spells as well as mini-games such as Gobstones, collecting ingredients for potions, Quidditch games, and Exploding Snap. It also has have six "environmental" spells including Accio and Incendio, and twelve combat spells. The game is free roaming with mini quests as well as closely following the story line[3].

PSP[]

The Game-Mechanics are different in the PSP version, because of the lack of the right analogue stick. Detailed information about the mechanics is missing.

PlayStation 3[]

The game uses SIXAXIS controls or the right analogue stick just like the previous game, but this time it includes DUALSHOCK 3 vibration capability. Also, it includes use of the PS3's trophy system.

PC[]

A keyboard and mouse is used, just like the previous game and the controls are reportedly easier to use. However, the game can also be controlled with an analogue joypad. Support for the XBOX 360 controller is built in (and graphics of controls use this controller), but other generic controllers work perfectly as well. There is no multiplayer wizard duelling for the PC platform, as the PC is purely single player.

Xbox 360[]

Spells are cast with the control stick just like the previous game.

Playstation 2[]

Spells are cast with the control stick just like the previous game.

Behind the scenes[]

In the game, during the Death Eater attack on The Burrow, Harry duels Bellatrix Lestrange twice and Fenrir Greyback once. In the film, Harry only deflects a few of their spells, and sends a couple of spells back at them, with the aid of Ginny and later with the aid of Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Arthur Weasley. In the book, the attack on the burrow scene doesn't take place.

In the game, Harry duels two normal Death Eaters in the castle, Fenrir Greyback in the Clock Tower Courtyard, and Bellatrix Lestrange by Rubeus Hagrid's cabin, which is on fire. In the film, Harry doesn't duel with any of the Death Eaters. He casts two spells at Snape, both of which get deflected, and Bellatrix hits him with a spell. In the book, Harry sends several curses at Snape, all of which get deflected. Snape retaliates with some spells of his own, then he leaves. Some other Death Eaters also attack Harry.

In the game, the stalls in the bathroom that Harry and Draco duel in have disappeared, leaving a wide open space with urinals on two walls. There is no cover whatsoever, unlike in the film.

After Harry takes Felix Felicis, he duels Crabbe and Goyle. During this duel, Crabbe and Goyle cannot hit Harry even when aiming directly at him. He then meets Slughorn in the Herbology greenhouses and brews a Dragon Dung Fertiliser. While brewing this potion, Harry can add as much of each correct ingredient, and boil or stir the potion as much as he likes without causing it to smoke.

Several areas were added to the castle, and some were taken away. Areas that were added are the Entrance Gates, the Quidditch Gate, the Quidditch Pitch, the Astronomy Tower, the Training Grounds, Slughorn's office, and a passage in the dungeons that leads to a spiral staircase that goes up to the sixth and seventh floors. Areas that were taken away include the entire Fourth Floor (except the Hospital Wing and the corridor outside of it that leads to the Clock Tower), the Prefect's Bathroom (you can see the door, but you can't go inside), Myrtle Warren's bathroom (replaced with the boys bathroom), the Trophy Room (you can see the door, but can't go in), the North Tower, the DADA Classroom (which is inaccessible) and the Room of Requirement, which is also not accessible.

As described in the book, whenever Harry goes near the Room of Requirement, a girl drops a scale. In the game, when you do the mission to find Draco on the seventh floor (where you find the Polyjuice Potion recipe), a girl drops scales which can be repaired, broken, levitated, and repulsed.

All the wands in the game are exact replicas of Harry Potter's wand and all brooms resemble Harry Potter's Firebolt.

In the game, only a fully charged Protego sends Expelliarmus, Levicorpus, and Petrificus Totalus back, but if it's a non charged Protego the spell is not deflected, and the spell still hits you.

In the game, if you beat all of the Duelling Clubs, you can fire two Stupefys in one shot, making it easier to stun someone.

In the game, during Gryffindor's second Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry catches the snitch and Gryffindor wins the match. In the book, Harry is hit in the head with a bludger by McLaggen, causing him to fall from his broom, and for Hufflepuff to win the match.

If Harry use Levicorpus on Bellatrix or Fenrir Greyback, the effect is not like when Harry casts it on students. Bellatrix and Greyback just fly up, they are not hoisted into the air and dangle upside-down.

This was the last Harry Potter game released for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable.

There was a small cutscene where Harry finished making a Shrinking Solution and asked Ginny to go to Hogsmeade which she denied it. During this, you can hear a record screeching sound effect and becomes one of the hilarious transitions in an HP game.
