        "text": "The Arabic chronicle (Ta'rīkh) of the Maldives composed by the qadi Ḥasan Tāj al-Dīn (d. 1139/1727) and continued by his nephew Muḥammad Muḥibb al-Dīn (1118/1706-1199/1785) and his grandson Ibrāhīm Sirāj al-Dīn (d. after 1243/ 1827) is major but unexploited source for not just Maldivian but also Indian Ocean history more broadly. Covering Maldivian history from the purported date of the islands' conversion to Islam in 548/1143, the Ta'rīkh is also imbued with a specific pious and ethical agenda. It seeks to situate the Maldives in the broader context of Islamic history stretching back to the Rāshidūn Caliphs, while using the past to impart ethical lessons to its audience, ostensibly the Maldivian sultans. However, its authors were also deeply involved in the Maldives' tumultuous political life, and their presentation of events is also influenced by their own personal experiences and factional affiliations. This article explores the pious, ethical and political agenda of the Ta'rīkh.\n\nThis paper explores the social stratification of Maldivian society, with particular focus on its history and traces of earlier alleged caste systems and slavery as well as their impact on Maldivian society, and the implications this fact had for their social structure. I will argue that some anthropologically remarkable traces of earlier social stratification, such as slavery and the caste system, can still be found on the islands. The same holds true for the social structure of the island Minicoy, part of the Sultanate Maldives until the beginning of the 16th century, which now belongs to India. I will demonstrate that while the middle castes have largely disappeared, the upper level of the caste hierarchy (which has survived in the local elite), the lower castes and certain groups of former slaves have been much more resistant to social developments and structural changes in the society.\n\nAbstract Success and Failures of Kingship and Government in Ancient Politics in Sri Lanka The main purpose of this paper is explore nature of success and failure of the government and administration system of king domain regimes in Ancient Sri Lankan politics. Until end of the 19th century that world experience was there are many different kind of monarchical governing system has been activated with subject to changers in many countries in the world. Also, Sri Lanka is a one of the South Asian countries which has long historical experience about dynastical King Domain governing and administration system. There was a strong governance system with territorial unity due to centralized power of the King. Also, there was different kind of king regimes were activated in different time periods until colonized of Sri Lanka. Since, there are several external threats as well internal influences were could be shown regarding Sri Lankan King domain governance. But, governing process was strongly maintained by the Kingship without any disruption. Simultaneously, there are many monarchical systems were activated in many countries in the world. Comparatively, there are many King domain governing systems were could be indentified in many countries in the world including South Asia. There are many monarchical governance has been activated in many countries and today they have become constitutional monarchies by adjust the existing Kingship Kingdom in many countries without abolished it. Yet, in Sri Lanka, could not continuously maintain or sustain such a monarchical governing system with their changing pattern of the politics why? This paper has examined this question regarding King Domain governance system of ancient Sri Lanka. Mainly, this research is depends on the existing literature and scholarly arguments. Therefore, critical analytical approach has been applied in the analysis for the paper. Secondary sources were applied to gathered information. Final output of this paper is that internal as well as external social and political factors have been influenced to demoralized existing ancient monarchical governance system in Sri Lanka. Due to these trends that system could not long term success. The main limitations of this research is finding relevant secondary sources documents which written by the previous scholars. Further, final output of this research can be used scholars who desire to do a research on same area with applying same methodology.
