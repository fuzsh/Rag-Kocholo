        "text": "First-time parents, Aisha Baker and SA cricketer, Wayne Parnell, named their beautiful baby boy Khalid, in 2018.\n\nAlso read: Aisha Baker just revealed her baby boy's name and its beautiful meaning\n\nThe blogger mom explained on Instagram that her bundle of joy was \"named after the great Khalid ibn Al Walid, a warrior in Islam, a revered Muslim and companion of the prophet (SAW)\". \"Ibn\" in Arabic means the \"son of\", which therefore means Khalid was the son of Walid, who was also a warrior in Islam, and Walid is also the name of Aisha's husband! Coincidence? Hmmm.\n\nAnd if that wasn't already majestic enough, we looked up the Arabic meaning of Khalid and found that it also means one who is \"eternal\", \"everlasting\" - a truly magnificent name for her beautiful baby boy.\n\nAlso read: Aisha Baker was \"poep scared of giving birth\"\n\nWe know that choosing a name for your little one who, from the very moment you meet, brings so much joy into your life, isn't the easiest task in the world.

And if you too have a little one on the way, you might be feeling somewhat overwhelmed looking for the perfect baby name.
