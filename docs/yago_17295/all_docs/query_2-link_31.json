        "text": "Sri Lankan Muslim Family Genealogy\n\nAssen Aliyar - Family 173\n\nAssen Ali Muhammad Nagoor Meera, the indefatigable \"Nuwara Mudalali\" and his brother, Assen Ali Muhammad Merra Lebbe, affectionately known as \"Meeyanna Mudalali\", were two enterpreanours who made a determined effort in successfully entering the closed and well-protected citadel of trade in Colombo wherein the British had firmly entrenched themselves.\n\nNagoor Meera and Meera Lebbe were born at Kongaraya Kurichchi, a predominantly Muslim hamlet close to the Mofussil township of Eral in the Tirunelvely District at the Southern tiphafeera of Tamil Nadu in South India Many were the Muslims of South India who came to ceylon in pursuit of trade as well as for the purpose of imparting the Arabic language and also spreading Islam Meera Lebbe was barely 14 years old and Nagoor Meera a few years younger when they first arrived in Ceylon around the second half of the 19th Century Their father, Assen Ali, had already settled down in the central hills of Ceylon several years back and was successful trading in household goods and merchandise He is believed to have spent most of his time in a place called Kithulgala and had eventually died there.\n\nThe two brothers, having arrived in Colombo, travelled to Rambukkana by train, and, from there, walked all the way to Kandy Meera Lebbe joined a bakery run by a kind-hearted Sinhala village Mudalali His renumeration was five cents per day considered a handsome salary in those times It was this beginning that paved the way for the two brothers to set up their own vegetable and supplies business in Kandy after a few years when they were almost in their early twenties They were readily assisted by the wealthy Kandyan Sinhala traders who recognized the enterpreneurship amongst the young lads.\n\nIn 1886, Nagoor Meera set up vegetable wholesale business under the business registration of AM Nagoor Meera & Company, at a sprawling complex at Gas Works Street in the Pettah, opposite the old Town Hall The establishment continues to exist, even until today (1998), having shifted its focus from vegetables to ship chandelling and shipping agency.\n\nAlthough the British merchants were the chosen favorites of the Colonial Government, they could hardly compete with the dynamic Nagoor Meera who outbid them almost everywhere possible Soon, through hard work and commitment, Nuwara Mudalali emerged as the largest supplier of vegetables to key government institutions and private enterprises in Colombo The Grand Orient Hotel (GOH), one of the few star class hotels in Colombo at that time, entry into which was forbidden for dogs and natives, was one of the prized customers of Nagoor Meera.\n\nEncouraged by the success in this wholesale trade in the Pettah, A M Nagoor Meera expanded the scope of his business to launch a ship chandelling agency a few years later\n\nAM Nagoor Meera was a person who was meticulous in his attire, wearing a long Surat cap and sporting a well trimmed beard, riding majestically in his twin horse carriage He was also a great lover of sweet meats for which his home district of Tirunelvely, in Tamil Nadu, is still famous for He had a close friend in Colombo who was also from his hometown of Kongaraya Kurichchi called cader Mohideen, popularly known as Neykara Mama (Ghee Uncle), who lived at Kehelwatte in Colombos Hultsdorf area Nagoor Meeras business complex was only a stones throw away from Neykara Mamas house who supplied him with Indian and local sweets manufactured at his residence Nagoor Meera used to help Cader Mohideen to clear his imported sweets at the port free of charge It is said that Muslim businessmen in Colombo who found it difficult to settle their debts to Nagoor Meera used to use the kind services of Cader Mohideen to intervene on their behalf and request for more time.\n\nNagoor Meera was a great philanthropist and gave liberally to both Muslim and Non-Muslim religious and educational institutions and the needy without any discrimination and hesitation whatsoever The Minan Mosque at Dematagoda Road was built by him and was maintained by his family members after him The office block at the Kuppiyawatte Muslim Burial Grounds was a donation by Nagoor Meera in memory of his eldest daughter, Ozeela Umma, who died at the young age of seventeen having suffered an attack of typhoid One of the houses at Dematagoda Road, where Nagoor Meera lived, was named after Niyaz, the only son of Ozeela Umma, as Niyaz Villa\n\nA wise and far-sighted person he was, Nagoor Meera invested his savings in real estate in Dematagoda, Maligawatte, and Maradana Vast tracts of land, stretching from St Johns College, Dematagoda Road to Reservoir Road  almost half of Dematagoda  were owned by the Nuwara Mudalali.\n\nNagoor Meera died in 1923 and left behind an estate valued at 21 million Rupees  a vast and unbelievable fortune at that time He also had three sons, Muhammad Haniffa (1893-1949), Muhammad Ishak (1901-1965), and Muhammad Zakariya who died at the age of nineteen, two daughrters, Oseela Umma and Faleela, who both died young His wife, Zainambu Natchiya, died at the ripe age of 95 in 1967.\n\nNagoor Meeras elder brother, \"Meeyanna Mudalali\" Meera Lebbe was the father of thirteen children, comprising five boys and eight girls Meera Lebbes eldest son, Muhammad Ismail, was the first Muslim to rise to the rank of Senior Superintendent of Police and was also the Sergeant-at-Arms of the first Parliament of Sri Lanka in 1947 Muhammad Ismails sons were:-Professor Mahroof Ismail, first Muslim to become the Professor of Parasitology of and the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Sri Lanka, Colombo Campus, Director of the Medical Research Institute, and Chairman of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine of Sri Lanka, Dr Ifthikhar Ismail, Muhammad Ghazzali Ismail, MR Ismail and Dr Samad Ismail of

Meera\n\nNMM Haniffa & NMM Ishak\n\nNagoor Meera, his brother Meera Lebbe, and their father Assen Ali, had left behind their landed property in their home village of Kongaraya Kurichchi when they came to Ceylon Contacts witheir relatives back home were, therefore, lost in time and the two brothers were busy carrying on their business activities in far-away Ceylon This led to the caretakers of these properties becoming the de facto owners, enjoying the fruits None of the children of Nagoor Meera and Meera Lebbe took any interest in staking their claims to their paternal properties back in Tamil Nadu.\n\nAfter Nagoor Meera's demise, the herculean task of presiding over the huge business empire, he had laboriously built over the years, fell on tghe shoulders of his sons, NMM Haniffa and NMM Ishak who had aklready mastered the techniques of the old man reasonably well Haniffa gave up his lucrative legal practice in order to devote his full time to the business, social activities, and religious work The two brothers, acting with wisdom and caution, built up the business in spite of the many great challenges that came their way after the Great Depression in the early thirties.\n\nIt was in the late thirties that the two brothers decided to go their own ways in business keeping the family unity and integrity intact Haniffa chose to run AM Nagoor Meera Sons & Company, engaged in Ship Chandelling and import & export, while Ishaw launched AM Nagoor Meera & Son, specializing in vegetable marketing Later on, Haniffa established another firm called EH Mohideen & Company.\n\nLike his father AM Nagoor Meera, Proctor Haniffa was a keen student of Islam and an exponent of the Tamil language and literature Islamic scholars from various parts of the country, and even South India, were regular visitors to Haniffa's Dematagoda Road residence They used to conduct regular weekend sessions between Haniffa and the visiting Islamic scholars, seated on mats spread out on the sprawling visitor's hall at his residence They discussed various subjects, interpretations, meanings and connotations on Islamic and Tamil works as well as Arabic Literature They were also of a very high intellectual standard Some of tghem were, Kakka Lebbe, Abdul Hassan (son of Muthuwappa Sinna Alim sahib of Kayalpattanam in Tamil Nadu who was the Imam of the Hanafi Jumuah Mosque in Kandy) and Idroos Moulana of Maruthamunai in the Amparai District.\n\nThe Tamil speaking Muslims of Ceylon should be grateful to Haniffa for having it translated from Arabic into Tamil Maulana Allama AK Abdul Hameed (Bhakavi), of Tamil nadu in South India, commenced his historic task of translating the Quran into Tamil on February 19, 1926, the first ever attempt to meet the crying need of the millions of Tamil speaking Muslims living in Ceylon, India, Singapore, Malaya & Burma At that time Moulana Abdul Hameed, father of AK Abdus Samad, the well known leader of the Tamil Nadu Muslim League, was already 50 years old Exactly after three years of tireless labor and extensive consultations with religious scholars and experts, Moulana Abdul Hameed successfully published the frist Tamil translation of Surah Al Baqarah on February 19, 1929 Slow and unsteady flow of funds impeded further progress of the project He tapped as many sources as possible to complete his mission Timely financial support by the NIzam of Hyderabad on the recommendations of his uncle, Nawab Nazeer Yar Jang Bahadur, in 1938 enabled Moulana Abdul Hameed to complete the translation of the entire Quran on October 24, 1942.\n\nBy now Moulana Abdul Hameed was 70 years old He sailed across to Ceylon in 1946 in search of generous minded souls who could extend a helping hand to have the translated manuscripts printed and published It was Proctor Haniffa who generously donated a handsome sum of Rs 50,000 for the project The translation saw the light of day on May 1, 1949 Sadly, Haniffa had already passed away when the historic mission was completed and fulfilled However, his generosity was acknowledged in the foreward of every copy of the translation that was published ever since It is also reported that duing the publishing phase of the project Haniffa himself rushed to Hyderabad to bring paper that was in shortage after WWII.\n\nAn ever grateful Abdul Hameed sent several copies of the translated Quran to Sithy Naseema, aniffa's second wife whom he married after the demise of his first wife, Ummu Hafeera When Naseema travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj in 1950, accompanied by her oldest daughter Marhooma, she presented copies of the Tamil translation of the Quran to the Imam of the Ka'abah for the use of Tamil speaking pilgrims who visit on pilgrimage They are still preserved there.\n\nSince then, seven editions of the Tamil translation have been published, in 1949, 1950, 1955, 1958, 1978, 1986 and 1995 The last two publications were financed by the Rabitah Al-Alam Al-Islami (The World Muslim Council), which has its headquarters in Makkah, at the personal initiative and efforts of MH Muhammad, son of NMM Haniffa\n\nHaniffa wa a towering personality in Colombo's social and religious circles, although he shunned publicity It was in recognition of his contributions to the Community that Haniffa was inducted as a Member of the first Board of Trustees of the Maradana Mosque, when it was incorporated in 1924, on the personal recommendation of the Hon WM Abdul Rahman, Legislative Councillor and father of Sir Razik Fareed A great honor at that ripe young age, indeed!\n\nNevertheless, Haniffa's charity was not just confined to the country of his birth alone Sithy Naseema recalled how her late husband even helped the economically-backward Muslims across the seas \"In 1946, we went to Kayal Pattanam in Tamil Nadu in South India Though there were Madarasas (Islamic religious schools), they were not enough to cater to the demand My husband provided financial assistance to build a Tamil School and a Madarasa in a Kayal Pattanam locality that was populated with a large number of illiterate children I remember that this institution was named \"Naseema\" after me\" (Sithy Naseema in an interview with the late MS Muhammad of Thinakaran Newspaper on April 18 1991 Page 5) The people of Kayal Pattanam still recall, with gratitude, the generosity of Haniffa and describe the school and Madarasa as a testimony to the committment of Haniffa to hekp the educational development of the backward Muslim children anywhere.\n\nMH Muhammad, his son stated, \"When I won my first Municipal election in 1947, I went to seek his blessings His advice to me was,'At times of triumph and in power, be humble You must behave in such a manner that people would have the same regard and respect for you even in times of defeat The people who were with you in victory should remain with you even in times of defeat -- forever' I vowed to practise it to its very letter and spirit in my political and private life - never to be arrogant and uppish but to be always accessible, considerate and listening to various voices\"\n\nHaniffa was 56 years old when he departed this world on Friday, March 25, 1949 he was the proud father of 21 children, 10 sons and 11 daughters; 12 by Ummu Hafeera, his first wife, and 9 by Sithy Naseema who survived him Sithy Naseema passed away in 2003 Her children are Yahya (deceased), Sithy Marina (wife of Sa'eed Sulaiman BSc, Petroleum technologist), Rabiyathul Adhawiyya (wife of SAM Faleel, Lawyer & ex-Assistant Commissioner of Labor), Mumtaza (wife of Rasheed Sulaiman, ex DIG and first Muslim Police Officer to head the Prime Ministerial and later Presidential Security Division during the tenure of President Ranasinghe Premadasa and Dingiri Banda Wijetunge), Muwaffaque (who married Rosemary Ondaatje and later Haseena), Zainamb Farhana (who married Colombo businessman, Imamdeen), fazlul Haque (deceased), Fazlur Rahman (deceased), and Mariathul Qibithiya (wife of Muhammad Ashroff Hussain, prominent businessman of Batcha & Company fame and also socio-religious activist in Sri Lanka) The two Sulaimans who married two of Naseema's daughters are brothers and children of Marjoona Sheikh Sulaiman, the youngest daughter of Meera Lebbe (older brother of AM Nagoor Meera).\n\nHaniffa'syounger brother Ishak, who married Ummu Khulzum, daughter of Idroos Lebbe (elder brother of paternal grandmother Zainambu Natchiyar), passed away in 1965 when he was 64 years old Ishak's five children are Sithy Aysha (wife of Dr MIM Nilar), Abdul Qadir who passed away at a young age, Muhammad Haleem Ishak, Sithie Mariam Muhammad and Sithie Fathima Haleem Ishak passed away in Sep 2003.\n\nProctor Haniffa's family can be proud of their progeny who held top office in the national political organizations, dominated by the Sinhalese at that time NMM ishak was the first Muslim to function as the Treasurer of the Ceylon Labor Union Ishak's son, Haleem, rose to the position of Vice President of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1978-1992, succeeding Dr Badiudin Mahmud Dr MCM Kaleel, father-in-law of Haniffa's two sons, Jaffer Sadique and Dr Munsif Meeran, was Treasurer and later Chairman of the United National Party.\n\nHaleem Ishak passes away - Island Thu Sep 25 2003\n\nFormer SLFP Member of Parliament for Colombo Central Haleem Ishak passed away yesterday\n\nHe was 74 years at the time of death\n\nThe late Haleem Ishak worked closely with late Prime Minister Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike to strengthen the party at times of crisis. He was a fine contributor in Parliament and spoke on selected subjects. Haleem Ishak was a politician respected by all communities and all parties in an outside Parliament. His funeral took place in Colombo yesterday (PG)\n\nSunday Island Oct 5 2003\n\nAppreciation\n\nHaleem Ishak - (I)\n\nThe passing away of Mr Haleem Ishak, a politician of distinction on 24th Sept 2003 brought sorrow, sadness and grief to the thousands who rushed to his residence to pay their last respects and to the many others who walked behind his bier to the Kuppiyawatta Muslim burial ground where his last remains were laid to rest.\n\nMr Ishak began his political career being elected to the Colombo Municipal Council as a member of the Kuppiyawatta East Ward in 1962 He was the only SLFP member elected to the CMC out of 46 others from other political parties Although the Kuppiyawatta East Ward has a cosmopolitan population and people are of different shades of political opinion, the late Mr Haleem Ishak was able to comfortably win the election and was re-elected twice in 1966 and 1969 and went on to represent this Ward as a distinguished councillor until the Council was dissolved in 1977.\n\nIn the parliamentary election of 1977, when the United National Party won a landslide victory, Mr Ishak was elected to the Multi-member Colombo Central constituency as the 3rd member from the SLFP, coming ahead of veteran politician, the late Mr Pieter Keuneman During the period 1977-1988, when the SLFP opposition in parliament was restricted to eight members, Mr Ishak never failed to express his views without fear or favour.\n\nIn 1979, the writer was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council to represent the people of Kuppiyawatta East Ward on behalf of the United National Party which Ward was previously ably represented by the late Mr Ishak for a continuous period of sixteen years.\n\nAn outstanding quality of the late Mr Ishak, he never failed to acknowledge and commend progress and development being undertaken by the Colombo Municipal Council in the Kuppiyawatta East Ward during the tenure of the writer who represented this Ward from 1979-2002 as a Municipal Councillor and thereafter as the Deputy Mayor and Mayor of Colombo.\n\nThe late Mr Ishak served the people irrespective of political affiliation during his four decades of public service as a Municipal Councillor and later as a Parliamentarian (1977-1994) Mr Haniffa Ishak, elder son of the late Mr Haleem Ishak continues the good work of his father serving the citizens of Colombo as a Municipal Councillor (1991-2002) and now as a party organizer.\n\nThe large gathering of mourners who came to pay their last respects at the burial ground in their thousands is ample testimony of the affection and admiration they had for the late Mr Haleem Ishak  A Man among Men.\n\n\"Inna Lillahi, Wa inna-illaihi-Raji-hoon\"\n\n(From the Almighty Allah we come, and to Him we go)\n\nOmar Kamil\n\nAmbassador for Sri Lanka in Iran\n\nHaleem Ishak - (II)\n\nMr Haleem Ishaks death was news of great anxiety and unbearable sorrow as he was one of my very close friends for the past four decades In the sojourn of sansara, we come across all sorts of people, but I strongly feel that people of the calibre of Haleem is so rare and limited I firstly encountered Haleem at the Colombo Municipal election in 1962 as the SLFP candidate for Kuppiyawatte In a virulent attack on Mr Somaweera Chandrasiri MP who was Haleem Ishaks key speake, in this election campaign, I supported the UNP candidate Mr Karunathilake My speech was so harsh that Haleem Ishak gave a press interview threatening libel action But both of us became very good friends, representing governing and opposing parties in the CMC Though I resigned from the Colombo Municipal Council our friendship never ended We were \"mango friends\" through thick and thin We fought many a political battle jointly in parliament and elsewhere Haleem discarded all air of self-aggrandizement, he was a resolute campaigner against the corrupting nature of power at any level He sincerely believed \"all power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely\".\n\nCircumstances of straight forwardness compelled him to change his political colouring, but so-called leaders got the best out of him and never reciprocated Im fully aware of the assurances and the promises that were given to him by the governing powers of the country and never fulfilled He was never a hot-headed politician moved by anger or indignation He hated injustice, tyranny and immorality, he was always fair and generous to his opponents and always ungrudgingly helped his friends in their needs Haleem Ishak even sacrificed his political career in coming to the rescue of so-called friends, who ultimately neglected or ignored him.\n\nIn the true sense of sports, Haleem Ishak was a true sportsman who played a \"losing\" game with pluck, patience and fearlessness I used to meet him very often after he had fallen ill and a few days before his death, I spent a considerable time with him I could visualize the height of his frustration and grief, when he requested me to visit him more frequently as it brought past memories and solace to him He was very pleased to mention that he won parliamentary elections with majority votes, which he got from Sinhala people I always consider him as a bridge builder who did his best to bring the Sinhalese and the Muslims together.\n\nHaleem Ishak was a very devoted husband to his exemplary wife who happens to be Minister M H Mohameds sister He was an amiable father to his sons, daughters and grandfather to his grandchildren.\n\nMay eternal bliss be with him.\n\nP A Jinadasa Niyathapala\n\nHon M H Mohamed\n\nThe above article was first published in the Wesley College OBU (UK) souvenir by Ananda Thevathasan\n\nA Distinguished Old Boy of Wesley College Hon Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed was born on 15 June 1921,at Dematagoda in Colombo his father NMMHaniffa was one of the first muslims to attend Wesley under Rev Samuel RWilkin Proctor Haniffa's father was the uncrowned King of Colombo's vegetable trade it is said that it was Proctor Haniffa father AMNagoor Meera who was one of the those philanthropist who helped Rev Henry HighfieldWhen the latter went around the country on his bicycle.\n\nHon MHMohamed joined Wesley in 1926 and spent the entirety of his student life at WesleyWhen asked why Wesley?

Hayhoe\n\nMunsif Meeran was one 0f the most colourful members that the UMAS has had throughout its history He had his initial medical training at the University of Ceylon and then came to Britain for postgrraduate studies at hospitals in England After a period as consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Benghazi Womens hospital in Libya he took the post of Director of the Zambia Flying Doctor Service, became President of the Zambian Red Cross and was involved on committees of the World Health Organisation\n\nOn his return to England he set up a thriving acupuncture clinic in south Croydon He also began teaching Acupuncture, writing an excellent little paperback Acupuncture: Science and Art and forming the Marina Academy of Acupuncture which successfully started many doctors on the road to Acupuncture Practice It was his constant frustration that the BMAS persIstently refused to grant approvaI to his course, indeed the Society seemed to have deliberately devised the rules for recognition in order to exclude him.\n\nHe was certainly an accomplished self-publicist I well remember at the opening ceremony of the Second ICMART World Congress in London, when he evaded the stewards to leap on the podium and present a set of his course video-tapes to a somewhat bemused Minister of Health And when the Chairman of the conference later complained to him that this was unacceptable behaviour, he caused even more consternation by writing to the ministry for the tapes to he returned.\n\nFor years the BMAS had been very comfortably run by a small, self-perpetuating committee, taking it in turns to hold the senior offices He managed to throw this comfy system into disarray by having himself proposed as chairman and forcing a ballot Sadly he received few votes, mainly because many people had difficulty penetrating his thickly accented speech, but he undoubtedly stirred up the committee Perhaps we could do again with some spirited character to perform a similar task every few years\n\nThe UMAS has attracted its share of eccentrics, but amongst them Dr Meeran was notable for his energy and enthusiasm in encouraging the medical use of acupuncture Despite the irritation that he so frequently engendered in other society members we need more like him and will truly miss him.\n\nAddendum by NDA: DrMH Meeran was the Senior Prefect at Wesley College in 1951 This note was sent to Shelton Peiris by RevWilliam Holden, one of our former Principals 1943-44 who is now in his 92nd year and lives in Glastonbury, England I have intimated to him that DrMeeran sadly passed away in 1998.\n\nFrom RevWilliam Holden in 1974\n\nI must share with readers an incident that took place a few years ago I had been admitted to a North London Hospital for surgery and was visited by the House doctor As we talked I learned that he was from Ceylon, that he had been a scholar during my term of office He remembered me He remembered how once when we were having open air assembly in the temporary buildings a coconut fell and missed me by inches' However, once he knew who I was, no kindness was too much for him His name was Dr Meeran I have since lost touch with him but should he read this I hope he will remember and accept my gratitude\n\nProfessor. M. Ismail\n\nProfessor Mahroof Ismail is a medical graduate who worked for many years at the Medical Research Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka. He was appointed its Director but opted to join the Faculty of Medicine as Professor of Parasitology. He subsequently became Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and retired a few years ago. His research was mainly on lymphatic filariasis and soil transmitted helminthiases. His research on filariasis formed the basis of the mass annual treatment in the current global programme for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis.\n\nHe has been associated with the World Health Organisation for a number of years. He has chaired Expert Committee Meetings and a number of Informal Consultations. Currently he is a member of the WHO Panel of Experts on Parasitic Diseases. He is also a member of the WHO Technical Advisory Group on Lymphatic Filariasis and is Chair of the South East Asian Regional Programme Review Group.\n\nApart from his academic interests he has been involved in community development in the eastern province for many years chiefly through projects on livelihood activities in order to alleviate the poverty that has caused such deprivation in the district. At first these were focused on communities displaced due to the ethnic conflict and more recently on communities affected by the onslaught of the tsunami.\n\nIn 1995 when Dr Inge Genefke, Medical Director IRCT visited Sri Lanka she was very keen that the Medical Faculty should get involved with the activities of the Family Rehabilitation Centre. She invited me as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine to join the Board of the FRC which I gladly accepted. Several academics from the Faculties of Community Medicine, Psychological Medicine and Forensic Medicine also serve on the FRC Board. Jointly they ensured that various aspects of torture and abuse and the rehabilitation of torture victims were incorporated in the new curriculum of the Faculty of Medicine, Colombo.\n\nAPPRECIATION  PROFESSOR MAHROOF ISMAIL\n\nJUNE 26, 2016\n\nBy Prof. Nilanthi de Silva\n\nOn 13 June 2016, Sri Lanka lost another doyen in the field of Medical Parasitology. Prof Ismail was one of the earliest members of the Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists, serving as its 11th President, in 1987. In 2015, when the College decided to honour those who have served the College and our profession by awarding honorary Fellowships, the Council was unanimous in deciding that Prof Ismail should be among the first recipients of a Fellowship.\n\nMohamed Mahroof Ismail obtained his MBBS from the University of Ceylon and his PhD in Medical Parasitology from McGill University, Canada. He also spent a post-doctoral year at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in the UK. After his return to Sri Lanka, he worked at the MRI for several years and became its Director in 1983. In the same year, he joined the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo as the Professor of Parasitology and later served as Dean of the Faculty from 1994 to 1996. Throughout his working life, Prof Ismail engaged in research, mostly on lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminths. His work was of such quality that it had significant impact on national as well as international health policies in relation to control of both groups of infections. The most significant body of work that he and his collaborators produced was to demonstrate for the first time that albendazole combined with diethylcarbamazine citrate or ivermectin has a pronounced and sustained effect of reducing microfilaraemia for over two years. This combination is currently being successfully used by the WHO and the Ministries of Health in 83 endemic countries as part of the global strategy to eliminate filariasis.\n\nProf Ismail also held many eminent posts, serving as a member of the University Grants Commission, as the Chairman of the Board of Management of the Post-Graduate Institute of Medicine; and as external examiner in Parasitology of the University of Malaya as well as the National University of Malaysia. He served the WHO at its Headquarters in Geneva, and in the South East Asian Regional Office in New Delhi in many different capacities: as Chairman of the WHO Expert Committee on Soil-Transmitted Helminthiases; as a member of the WHO Expert Committee on Lymphatic Filariasis and the WHO Technical Advisory Group for Lymphatic Filariasis; as a WHO Consultant to Egypt and Bangladesh to revise their National Filariasis Control Programmes; and Chairman of the South East Asian Programme Review Group for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis from 2002 until 2006.\n\nI am just one of many who owe an immense debt of gratitude to Prof Ismail. I learnt much of my parasitology from him, as a medical student, as a postgraduate student, and even after that. He was one of the examiners at my MD examination in 1994. I still recall very clearly, the occasion when I went to thank him after passing the exam. I was a young probationary lecturer back then, who had just started working at Ragama, in a medical faculty that was virtually in its infancy. My husband Janaka and I met Prof Ismail in the Deans Office in the Colombo Medical Faculty. We talked of this and that, and then I asked him if he had any suggestions for research. He immediately shared with us an idea that had occurred to him while attending a WHO meeting a few weeks previously. He said that this study could only be done in Sri Lanka because of the confluence of circumstances at that moment in time, but that it had the potential to transform international policy with regard to deworming programmes. Together with other colleagues from Ragama, we turned this idea into a study that was eventually published in one of the foremost medical journals. This little episode is only one example of the unassuming generosity and supportiveness that Prof Ismail extended to all who came into contact with him. He probably never thought twice about what he did, but for me, it was a landmark in my academic career.\n\nOver the decades since then, we came into contact at regular intervals, especially at Parasitology oral examinations for medical students. Those times when I was his co-examiner were days that I really enjoyed, because Prof Ismail somehow turned them into learning experiences for both students and me, and his unfailing sense of humour lessened the tedium of coping with medical students who seemed to view Parasitology oral exams as an instrument of torture.\n\nAs he gradually withdrew from the professional arena, Janaka and I tried to stay in touch by visiting him at home. He was an unfailingly courteous and considerate host, and we learnt that he was an excellent cook, who also enjoyed good food. We also saw a marriage that seemed to have been made in heaven. Prof Ismail and his wife Jezima, an equally eminent figure in her own right, in the field of education, lived their life together, not only in bringing up a family, but in many other ways that sought to support the underprivileged and disadvantaged."
