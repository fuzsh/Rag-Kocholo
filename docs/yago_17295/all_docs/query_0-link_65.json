        "text": "Earlier in August, His Highness the Aga Khan, the 49th Imam of Ismaili Muslims announced that the Nikah of his eldest son, Prince Rahim Aga Khan, to Ms. Kendra Salwa Spears would take place in Geneva on August 31, 2013.\n\nThe day finally arrived with the Nikah taking place as announced in Geneva, Switzerland, in a private ceremony attended by members and friends of both families. At the request of Mawlana Hazar Imam, His Highness Prince Karim Aga Khan, the Chairman and Members of the Ismaili Leaders’ International Forum (LIF), see photo above, represented the global Ismaili community at the event held on the shores of Lake Geneva, on the grounds of the Château de Bellerive — the residence of Mawlana Hazar Imam’s uncle, the late Prince Sadruddin and his wife Princess Aliya.\n\nIsmailis around the world rejoice with their beloved Imam and his family as well as the family of the bride, and wish Prince Rahim Aga Khan and his beloved bride, Princess Salwa peace and happiness in their life together.\n\nIn Islam, the Nikah is a solemn and sacred social contract between the bride and the groom; each has the “liberty to define various terms and conditions of their liking and make them a part of this marriage contract.” [1]\n\nWe convey our heartiest felicitations to all our readers on this happy occasion and encourage readers to express their wishes and thoughts by clicking on Leave a Comment.

In the unseen, the orchestra of angels and starlight are showering special blessings, akin to an unseen or hidden orchestra playing its resounding symphony. Metaphorically, the occasion is set…i.e. Allah has set the stage.\n\nTo express your wishes and thoughts on Prince Rahim’s marriage to Ms. Spears, please click on Leave a Comment.
