        "text": "This one is for all those who send me their love through emails and comments. I do apologise for not replying to them. The only time I do have is to actually sit and read them. And seriously, you guys are just amazing. Keep them flowing.\n\nJust a quick question. Would you like to have a post from Sameer’s POV? let me know, comment below or email me surtidiaries@gmail.com. Any other ideas welcome. would love to hear from you.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nMost people get married believing a myth that marriage is beautiful box full of all the things they have longed for; Companionship, intimacy, friendship etc … The truth is, that marriage at the start is an empty box, you must put something in before you can take anything out. There is no love in marriage, love is in people, and people put love in marriage. There is no romance in marriage, you have to infuse it into your marriage. A couple must learn the art, and form the habit of giving, loving, serving, praising, of keeping the box full. If you take out more than you put in, the box will be empty.\n\nIt’s been two months since our nikah and so far so good. As per every single marriage known to man, we had to return to some sort of routine. and we did, eventually. Be it a good or bad thing, The madressa found a teacher not long after I took my two weeks leave and I was officially no longer a “madressa apa”. Part of me was saddened but a part of me felt a little okay with it. I needed to settle down in my new home and new life and leaving home to teach something I wasn’t fully qualified for didn’t seem suitable. I was not qualified for the job and she was. Seemed to me a fair deal. I was sad though, teaching was actually a great learning experience for me. Safiyya suggested I join the morning madressa and who knows maybe I will. Right now though, I needed to get myself trained to be a wife. Which is, harder than I expected.\n\nI know its all cliché and everything but let’s be honest, marriage is definitely not a bed of roses. Okay, marriage is, being a wife isn’t. I can think of billions of fairy tales where they teach you exactly what happens when you meet a guy, each with different storylines and different characters. But, every one of them have the two same things in common, once upon a time and happily ever after. But I think that’s where the problem stems. Because they don’t tell you anything about what happens after. It’s all up to you to find out. And that is where your true journey begins. That is the real once upon a time.\n\nI turned around as fast as I could and slammed my fist on the alarm clock. The room fell silent and with a sigh I closed my eyes again.\n\nMe: Imz! Get up! (Yawn) it’s Tuesday! You have a meeting remember?\n\nImraan shot out of bed and ran into the bathroom. Three minutes later he came out, gave me a kiss and went back in the shower. Lazily, I got up to make his lunch. Once I brushed my teeth and washed my face I was fresh. Thank goodness. I baked him mini pizza’s and fried a few samosas. Then I made our breakfast. I liked to just have coffee and cake and he was everyday different, according to him whatever I felt he would like. Trust me, it might be cute and everything but it is really pressurising.\n\nImraan: (walking in) you just know exactly what I want every single day. It’s like you can read my mind.\n\nMe: and you just know how to flatter a girl.\n\nImraan: not just any girl (wink)\n\nHe walked to me and put his arms around my neck. I blushed.\n\nMe: (lump in my throat) Imraan, I am trying to make fast here. You going to be late.\n\nImraan: don’t stress yourself out. It doesn’t matter if I’m late.\n\nMe: really? (Raised eyebrow)\n\nImraan: no. but I will be late for you. Any day.\n\nMe: aw how sweet. You are definitely wearing the charming shirt today.\n\nImraan: (looking at his shirt) you like it? (Smirk)\n\nMe: stop it.\n\nImraan: stop what? (Smirk) huh? (Wider smirk) huh?\n\nMe: (getting redder) Imraan!\n\nHe laughed at his success to make me blush and let me make the rest of the egg. That was his job every day. To annoy me until I blush. You would think that I would get used to it and stop blushing but no. it just gets worse every day. He is a charmer. And I am a softie, what can I say?\n\nOnce imraan had his breakfast which should I mentions was orange juice with two sunny side up eggs, cheese, polony and mushrooms, I opened for him to go. He tried to kiss me goodbye but I kept moving my face and he missed. But I am not as fast as him and eventually he got it. Once I closed the door, my fun for the morning was over. Now begins the even more fun. Not.\n\nThankfully, I had a housekeeper who helped with the work. In fact she did most of the work. All I did was make the bed, my mother was very particular about making sure I learnt that from little, and cook. Well learn to cook at least. Once imraan left for the office, I jumped back in bed for another hour of sleep. Don’t look at me with those judgey eyes. I got up again when Silvia (housekeeper) rang the bell and that was when my training to be a better cook began. The same as every weekday besides Fridays- Imraan is off and we have lunch at his parents’ house.\n\nI was already getting the hang of cooking like a pro. Who would have thought that YouTube could be such a good cooking instructor? Okay I lie, I’m terrible. Even with a ton of YouTube tutorials. It sucked not to have someone there to take over when you were struggling or to fry the puri when you rolled it out. Helping in the kitchen is one thing, but doing everything yourself? Not very easy when you spoilt. There were so many days when I wished I came from a background that made me work. It would have been so much easier.\n\nYouTube was there to show you but not to do. I had this idea last night while going through some of the recipes. Why don’t I try macaroons? The recipe seemed fairly easy and it couldn’t be that bad to make right. Right?\n\n*two hours later*\n\nMaking macaroons is probably the worst idea for an almost beginner. I whipped the mixture one more time, poured it into a piping bag I made and started to make circles on my baking tray just like the recipe said. One or two leaked a little and touched but I used a fork to scrape it and separate it. I popped it into the oven and with a huge sigh of relief, I stood up. Two hours, I thought, this better come out good!\n\nMy thoughts were snapped away by the loud shrill on the phone. I put down the bowl I was about to wash and drying my hands on my apron, ran to answer.\n\nMe: as salaamu alaikum.\n\nMaseeha: (cheerful voice) wa alaikum salaam sister in law. How’s it going?\n\nMe: all good alhamdulillah mas! And your side? You never going to drop the whole sister in law thing are you?\n\nMaseeha: nope! I’m not. All is good here too alhamdulillah.\n\nI heard Naseema screaming in the background, “will you cut to the chase and ask her already!”\n\nMe: ask me what?\n\nMaseeha: well we were just wondering if maybe we could you know come and chill by your place? That is only if you know, you don’t have a problem with us being there.\n\nMe: (laughing) you asking? You guys know that I’m still your best friend right? You don’t have to ask to visit me!\n\nMaseeha: yeah we know that but we thought maybe you need some…some space and…You know you married now and…\n\nMe: (laugh) just get yourselves here. I will be grey by the time you decide what to say.\n\nNaseema: (in background) sabs!! She said we can come!!\n\nMe: sabs? As in Sabeeha?\n\nMaseeha: yeah she came last night. Didn’t want to disturb you. She said she has something to tell you also. Do you need anything?\n\nMe: nah, I’m good (idea coming to mind) on second thought, why don’t you make breakfast for me.\n\nMaseeha: you didn’t have breakfast yet? Dude it’s already…\n\nMe: (cutting her off) I had. I just want your breakfast.\n\nI gave her my breakfast order and put the phone down. Luckily, my macaroons didn’t burn, I completely forgot about it. It didn’t come out perfectly but it wasn’t a flop either. Might as well have been a flop but whatever, I will try harder the next time. Or try harder never. I creamed them with the marshmallow Icing I made and quickly tried to get everything cleaned. Fifteen minutes later, I opened the door to receive the three of them. In swimsuits.\n\nMe: what in the world of marshmallow macaroons?\n\nNaseema: (pushing me aside and walking in) is it just me or am I smelling exactly what you said?\n\nMaseeha: salaams sister in law (I rolled my eyes and she smirked) hmmm (taking a deep breath) that smells amazing! Could it be true? Is Amira really learning to finally do everything herself?\n\nMaseeha placed the huge basket in my hand and walked passed me. Sabeeha tapped my shoulder and also walked in. I just shook my head. Some things just never change.\n\nMe: you know you could have told me you coming swimming!\n\nMaseeha: yeah about that, the idea came to us after we called. Sorry.\n\nMe: do you guys not have lives to live?\n\nSabeeha: pssht. Wait let me just check. Oops nope. Not us. We didn’t get married, or get a huge amazing penthouse as a gift, or have annoying friends who crash every now and again at that amazing penthouse which is not that much of a deal if it has so few people in it. So Nah. We don’t have any lives to live just yet.\n\nMe: drama queen! (I placed the basket on the table and started emptying the Tupperware’s.) Just turn up the heat there for me. It won’t take long to get hot.\n\nSabeeha: wait! Your pool is heated??\n\nMaseeha: (smile) my brother likes to swim at night, even in winter!\n\nSabeeha: I see! But still! A heated pool! Cool! Mahn this place just keeps getting better and better. Next you going to be telling me you have a Jacuzzi in your bathroom. (I bit my lip) you do? No way! Sweet!\n\nNaseema: so you really made these (studying the macaroons like it was a frog specimen in science class)\n\nMaseeha: ooh yum!\n\nMe: it’s not grand or anything but I tried. Jazakallah for the breakfast mas!\n\nNaseema: helloww! We also helped!\n\nMe: I can only imagine what a help you two were!\n\nSabeeha: look who’s talking, three months back you were all (imitating me) I know how to bake and cook. (Her voice) and now you all (imitating voice) does anyone know how to braise onions? Coz this stuff is really not as easy as I thought. (Her voice)\n\nMe: (scrunching my nose) I don’t even sound like that!\n\nSabeeha: yes you do, but seriously though, did you like lose your cooking skills? Maybe it’s a side effect of marriage!\n\nNaseema: (laughing) that is a good one. Side effect (giggle) side effect of marriage. Nice one sabs. (They high five)\n\nMe: you guys are like preschool kids. Mentally unstable preschool kids.\n\nThe doorbell rang and I looked at them confused. Nobody comes during the day on a weekday except for them and they were sitting in my lounge. I got up and went to check. Safiyya strolled in with her pram and Mohammed gurgled excitedly as he kicked his legs.\n\nMaseeha: oh did we forget to tell you that we invited safs too? Maaf.\n\nMe: it seems as though you’ll have forgotten to tell me a lot of things today. Anything else? Maybe a party at my house I was not aware of? (I raised my eyebrow)\n\nSafiyya: (giving me a hug) they said pool party. (To Mohammed in her baby voice) isn’t my baby. A pool party just for us.\n\nI just shook my head and took Muhammad out of his pram. Everyone awed at his cute baby costume. He looked so adorable. We set the table for breakfast and they all went and sat around the pool while I went to change. We sat at the edge and dipped our feet while Safiyya held Mohammed close to her- who seemed to be loving the warm water- and moved around.\n\nMe: hey sabs. You had something to tell me.\n\nSabeeha: oh yeah. I had two things actually.\n\nMe: spill away then.\n\nSabeeha: well you can’t tell your mother I told you but we are thinking about moving to Durban.\n\nMe: what? That would be amazing. Seriously?\n\nSabeeha: yes, dad got an offer to transfer and he took it. But it’s not confirmed yet.\n\nMe: wow, that’s perfect sabs. But uni?\n\nSabeeha: yeah a friend of my uncle had a chat with me. He said they will be able to transfer me for second semester so that won’t be a problem.\n\nMaseeha: you can do that?\n\nSabeeha: apparently.\n\nWe all tuned our heads as naseema came running from the lounge and cannonballed into the pool. Mohammed let out a huge laugh and hiccupped excitedly.\n\nSabeeha: Yeah and the second thing is not good news.\n\nMe: I don’t like the sound of that!\n\nSabeeha: neither do I! I was shopping at Sandton City last week and I was buying myself a milkshake at Häagen-Dazs and while waiting I just kind of saw him. I swear it was by mistake.\n\nMaseeha: who? Ahmed?\n\nSabeeha: no! No! Sameer.\n\nMe: Vawda?\n\nSabeeha: At first I thought, no it can’t be him. But then I saw that t-shirt. You know the Madrid one with Keylor Navas autograph?\n\nSafiyya: wait who’s that?\n\nMaseeha: one of the players in Madrid.\n\nMe: I’m still not getting why this is a bad thing.\n\nSabeeha: he wasn’t alone Amira. There was this girl, gorgeous and the works, she was sitting on his lap. It wasn’t a very good sight if you know what I mean.\n\nMe: are you sure it was Sameer? Sameer Vawda?\n\nMaseeha: I was also not believing her but then I started thinking. Sameer didn’t come for any of your functions. He didn’t even visit or call. Or did he?\n\nMe: (shaking my head) but that doesn’t proof that it was him.\n\nSabeeha: yeah but why didn’t he come then? Not even for the wedding?\n\nMe: I don’t know. To be honest I was also a little worried but his mother told me everything is fine. She was still in iddat so she couldn’t come and he was out of town…\n\nI stopped midway as I realised what I just said.\n\nMe: oh no.\n\nSabeeha: I am sorry I had to see him Amira. It was purely by chance.\n\nAmira: hey there is no need for you to be apologising.\n\nSabeeha: I think he is gone back to his past.\n\nMe: so now? It’s not like I can even talk him out of anything. He won’t listen. And plus, it’s his life. I have nothing to do with it and no right to intervene.\n\nMaseeha: you’re right. But you also wrong. You know you have an influence on him.\n\nMe: that’s only because he has a thing for me you guys know that right?\n\nSabeeha: (widening her eyes) a what? Wait? Sameer has a thing for you? OHMY…WHATINTHE\n\nMe: had. He had a thing. It’s over now. I hope.\n\nNaseema: how do you know?\n\nMe: I don’t. That is why I wish to stay out of this. (Holding up my left hand) I’m married remember?\n\nMohammed let out a yelp and it sounded like a yes so we all laughed. That broke the ice that was beginning to form in the air. After that maseeha slid in the pool and swam over to Mohammed. She made Sabeeha to bring his sunglasses and blow up ring. She blew it up, put him inside, put on the sunglasses and pushed him lightly. We all cooed. He looked just too cute. I snapped a few pics of him looking like a cool dude.\n\nsabeeha: amira? you cant ignore it. you two were getting quite close what happened?\n\nme: what happened is that I learnt that one is allowed to marry their step sibling, which by the way I didn’t know. I dont know why but I always thought that a step brother was like a real. And after that I just couldn’t. I didn’t want it to start all over again. I had enough boy drama.\n\nmaseeha: so you going to ignore it?\n\nme: no. (sigh) you know me. I will call him tomorrow. See what’s going on. I’m sure it must just be a one time thing and he will come around. lets just forget about it for now.\n\nI swam towards the edge and grabbed the ball from the side, jumping up, I threw it at sabeeha.\n\nMe: How’s hajj preparations going saf?\n\nWe played all day in the pool. Safiyya got out to bath Mohammed and put him to sleep and then got back in. by the time we got out, it was afternoon and we were all shrivelled up. We had a shower and flocked to the kitchen to make something to eat. The easiest was burgers so we all got together and made our very own recipe burgers. Imraan was home earlier than we thought, thankfully though because we were starved- swimming really makes you hungry. He let himself in and looking at us all shook his head and laughing.\n\nImraan: I see this has become the den for you’ll.\n\nHe came to where I was sitting and gave me a kiss. I blushed red.\n\nImraan: are they troubling you babe? Coz I will kick them out if you want?\n\nMaseeha: isn’t that what a sister in law is meant to do? Trouble and make the brother’s wife a living hell?\n\nI stuck my tongue out at her.\n\nMaseeha: and anyway, how can you kick your sister out. Imagine the headlines, newly wedded couple kicks sister in law out of home.\n\nWe all laughed.\n\nImraan: more like, brother makes a huge mistake and marries sister’s best friend. Ruined for life.\n\nMe: (pushing him off the couch) hey!\n\nImraan: aw (wink) no need to stress. You my dear, is my favourite mistake.\n\nNaseema: (throwing the cushion at him) you can do a better stolen quote than that you idiot.\n\nHer outburst set us off on another frantic laugh.\n\nImraan: (smirk) someone is getting very jealous here. (getting up) anyways, I am going down to the ground floor. I need to check if my maintenance guy came in today. I will be back in the next half an hour, okay babe?\n\nMe: and supper? You not hungry?\n\nImraan: that is actually a very good suggestion. Let’s eat first.\n\nSo we ended up eating. The burgers came out divine. We actually make a pretty cook team of chefs. Even the chips tasted amazing. Imraan let us be after supper and went down to sort his building stuff out. Before he left he gave naseema the most peculiar look and I made a mental note to ask him later why.\n\nSabeeha: so guys? I have something to tell you’ll.\n\nMe: good or bad?\n\nSabeeha: it depends.\n\nMaseeha: can you cut the tension and tell us.\n\nSabeeha: You remember Yusuf Asmal?\n\nMe: uh yeah…\n\nSabeeha: he sent a proposal…\n\nsalaams. There has been a request for Imraan’s POV. I am considering it for the next post. let me know what you think.\n\nI know I am very very late, but it’s still friday right?\n\nenjoy.\n\nIf you want something to last forever, you treat it differently. You shield it and protect it. You never abuse it. You don’t expose it to the elements. You don’t make it common or ordinary. If it ever becomes tarnished, you lovingly polish it until it gleams like new. It becomes special because you have made it so. And it grows more beautiful and precious as time goes by.\n\nI stared out the window, taking a moment to admire the unflinching ability of the clouds to look like candy floss, and sipped at the water the airhostess had passed me. So this is what it felt like to come home after amazing vacation with your husband. Imraan’s head was laid back on his seat and I could hear his soft breaths. I covered my mouth to block a huge yawn and lay on the window. The flight just never seemed to end.\n\nI woke up with a shock when someone tapped me. Turning I realized that it was Imraan.\n\nImraan: we landing.\n\nMe: (yawn) I am so tired.\n\nImraan: sorry I woke you.\n\nMe: it’s okay. I’ll sleep when we get home. (Yawn)\n\nThere wasn’t many people that came to meet us at the airport. But when I say not many, I mean not many for an Indian family. Because let’s be honest, nobody fly’s in and out of their hometown without having an entire jamaat there. It’s like a family reunion. At the airport.\n\nSo with my eyes half closed, my ears still numb from the pressure of the air and my body jetlagged, I hugged the entire female congregation who were full of smiles and energy. Duh, they didn’t just fly for an entire day!\n\nWe stood at the international arrivals for a really long time and chatted. By the time we left, it was already dark. My family headed home while Imraan and I went home with his parents. We made small talk in the car and they insisted we come home for supper. Imraan started to explain to them that I was tired but I stopped him and agreed.\n\nMe: (walking into the kitchen) what can i help with?\n\nImraan’s mother: no no. Nothing to do. Don’t worry everything is already ready. You must be exhausted. You rest.\n\nMaseeha: yeah amy (sarcastic smile) no stress. You just rest.\n\nI stuck my tongue out at her when her mother turned her back.\n\nMy mother in law went out of the kitchen.\n\nMe: (slipping into one of the comfy kitchen stools) not like you doing anything yourself! What you getting jealous of?\n\nMaseeha: me? Jealous? Puhlease! Tell me, how was lilly beach?\n\nMe: that place is amazing mas! Its so beautiful. You have to go there!\n\nMaseeha: well i shall consider it for out annual trip overseas. On to the question everyone is dying to ask you but is scared, how’s marriage?\n\nMe: can you ask me that question another time. I didn’t plan that answer yet!\n\nMaseeha just looked at my face with a confused look. Then she started giggling.\n\nMaseeha: my brother married a crazy woman.\n\nMe: you mean your best friend married an amazing guy who happens to have a crazy sister?\n\nImraan: (calling from the lounge) Amira?\n\nMaseeha: (groan) mahn! Now i have to share you (sigh)\n\nI laughed as i slipped off the stool to find imraan.\n\nWe left from the house very late and i could no longer keep my eyes open. I was more exhausted than ever.\n\nAs soon as imraan let us in i was crawling up the stairs and heading toward the bedroom. I didnt even wait to see imraan come upstairs. I just needed to sleep.\n\nThe next day was the day before the walima. I got up looking like someone hit me in the face with a bowling ball. Imraan walked into the room.\n\nImraan: good morning sunshine! (Pause) or should i say moonshine!\n\nMe: (sigh) I thought i was the drama queen!\n\nImraan: and so you are my dear! (Smirk) I’m the king! (Handing me a mug)\n\nMe: aw you made coffee? (Taking a sip)\n\nImraan: sorry my queen. I do not have the knowledge to make coffee. However i did make you milo!\n\nMe: (getting choked and spluttering) wait what? (I burst out laughing) you don’t know how to make coffee? Are you kidding me?\n\nImraan: (sitting down on the bedroom lounger) no. I might have forgot to buy a few electrical appliances and i have never made coffee accept for from a coffee machine.\n\nMe: (smirk) oh really now?\n\nImraan: yes. you just press the button and out comes the coffee.\n\nMe: you motalas are too spoilt!\n\nI turned on my side and a striking pain waltzed through my body making me scream in pain.\n\nMe: ow!\n\nImraan: whats wrong? (Worried look)\n\nMe: i cant move properly. My body is sore.\n\nImraan: want to go bungee jumping again?\n\nMe: (rolling my eyes) don’t start again. You gave me enough beans as it is about me making you do bungee.\n\nImraan: you know you could have chose anything else. Anything. Horse riding, archery, swimming, whale watching. But no, of all the things you choose bungee!\n\nMe: well there was wind surfing?\n\nImraan: (laugh) i still can’t believe you actually did that! And you made me do it!\n\nMe: i don’t regret it. I think i can handle this pain. (I moved again) ow!\n\nImraan helped me out of bed and i had the quickest shower in my life. My entire neck downward felt paralyzed. Imraan was kind enough to give me a massage (he sucked at it but at least he tried.)\n\nHe ordered take out for supper and we both sat on the bed and had pizza, subs and coke. I was out after that.\n\nImraan: amira! Hey amira!!! We late!\n\nImraan pulled the duvet out slowly and i tugged it away from him and turned the other way with a groan.\n\nImraan: amira! We are really late!\n\nMe: for what? (My eyes still closed andy back facing imraan)\n\nImraan: (stating the obvious) the walima.\n\nMe: the walima. (Pause) our walima.\n\nI shot out of the bed like a spring and sprinted to the bathroom as fast as i could. If I thought the previous days shower was fast, i was wrong.\n\nIt was my walima day and I was extremely late. I got ready as fast as I could, running from one side to another to find my stuff. I didn’t have much time to put much makeup so I just put on the basic stuff and Imraan and I were off. I wore a plain white dress with silver work all down the sleeves. It was simple, free flowing and set like a dream. Imraan wore the grey tuxedo that he was supposed to wear for the nikah.\n\nMe: why didn’t naseema call? Normally she calls if you like 2 seconds late, this is like half an hour!\n\nI checked my phone. 76 messages. 12 missed calls. Oops.\n\nSabeeha was standing in the driveway when we pulled in and she quickly helped me to look presentable. We rushed to the backyard and i was greeted by a very ballistic naseema. She was going crazy. we had an entire conversation through gritted smiles, everyone was watching the new bride. To date, I still haven’t come up with a good enough reason how naseema is my friend.\n\nIf i thought her scolding for being late for my own walima was bad, you should have seen her after that.\n\nnaseema: OH MY WORD. AMIRA!!! LIFT YOUR DRESS UP!\n\nme: huh?\n\nnaseema: YOUR DRESS! LIFT IT UP!!\n\nI obeyed and lifted it up. looking down at myself i realised what she was having a fit about. In that rush, i forgot to wear the shoes that I bought to match the dress. instead, I was wearing a gold pump. Before I could set foot in the garden, she sent me off to maseeha’s room to find a “decent’ pair of shoes.\n\nThe garden setting was breathtakingly amazing. It was marvelously impressive. she divided the garden using a long mirror screen. the mirror made each side look bigger and gave the place a beautiful effect. The sides were lined with mine water features and goldfish bowls. Huge, round tables filled the place up and at the front was three see-through steps that led to a mini pavilion that was decorated with flowers. the table setting was plain and simple and only made everything look so much more elegant. The menu was straight forward, sojee, chicken biryani and roasted chicken with buns. The function was short and sweet and everything was over quickly.\n\nI sat upright against the headboard and maseeha helped to put a pillow behind me. That same afternoon i started burning up and my eyes were watering non stop. naseema was sprawled on the carpet and maseeha took a seat on the leather one man couch. safiyya who just came in looking like she was crying sat at the edge of the bed.\n\nsaffiyya: i have good news to tell you’ll!\n\nme: spill! spill!\n\nsaffiyya: okay. wait for sabeeha then. shes coming now.\n\nwe sat in silence for five minutes and waited. the door swung open and sabeeha strolled in with muhammed in her arms.\n\nmaseeha: finally! would you sit already, saf has something to tell us.\n\nsabeeha sat down on the floor against the cupboard.\n\nsabeeha: oooh…tell…tell…tell\n\nsaffiyya: (her eyes lighting up) Zaakir and I have been accepted for Hajj!\n\nThis post is dedicated to sister Amina who gave me much needed advice. Sister Amina, your advice was much appreciated. Jazakallah.\n\nAnd for those of you who are reading the blog and not commenting, I would love to hear from you.\n\nEnjoy the post💖\n\nHappiness. Happiness is not determined by the cost of your car, or the price of your house. It’s not determined by the digits on your bank account. And neither is it determined by the once in a year extravagant vacations. Maybe we are fortunate enough to be blessed with such luxuries, but in the end, true happiness is when you can love and be loved. For love, love is the master key that opens the gate of happiness.\n\nAnd if love is happiness…what could be better than halaal love?\n\nI tore my eyes open and the sunlight forced me to shut them. Once I was myself again, I slowly opened my eyes, my eyelids parting very slowly. I could hear a heart beating loudly and the smooth skin that touched my cheeks raised up and down. I closed my eyes again.\n\nWait. Where am I?\n\nMy head bobbed up so quickly with a shock. I looked around me and then, calming down I smiled. I remembered the afternoon before. I lay my head back on Imraan’s chest and replayed the previous night in my head. My first night as a married girl.\n\nFlashback:\n\nA tear rolled down my right eye and I had to gasp for air. It was all just too overwhelming. It was all just too good to be true.\n\nImraan: hey! Are you crying? (Looking worried) amira? (He leaned in to wipe my tear)\n\nMe: uhm… (Smile)\n\nImraan was still holding the box in front of me. I smiled reassuringly and gave him my left hand. He fiddled with the box and had to yank the ring out. He slipped it on my finger and I held it up, admiring it.\n\nMe: wow. I really have no idea what to say.\n\nImraan: it’s beautiful hey?\n\nMe: it is. But it’s not just the ring that I am so taken aback by. I don’t…I don’t think I can say something to match your letter. It’s…it’s so perfect. (Pausing and the raising an eyebrow) are you sure you wrote it?\n\nImraan: well…I wrote it with my hands…using my pen. (My mouth dropped in an o shape) nah, I’m just pulling your leg. I wrote it, seriously. Though… I might have taken assistance from a dictionary.\n\nI laughed.\n\nImraan: (looking at his watch) do you think you can get out of this gown and into something more (looking me up and down) small, in ten minutes?\n\nMe: ten minutes?? Urh I can try.\n\nLet’s just say I tried. But I needed imraan to help me into the small bathroom, I had to call him back in to get the zip opened, I called him once again to pull it off my head and then again to take it out of the bathroom. Mahn gowns were a headache.\n\nMy mother packed me a really lovely abaya and picked out all the matching accessories to go with it so all I had to do was get it on me as fast as I could. Imraan still didn’t tell me where he was taking me and I didn’t even waste my time asking him. I guess I was going to have to get used to spontaneous short trips and crazy ideas.\n\nMe: (coming out of the bathroom) why do you look like you just ran a race down fifty floors.\n\nImraan: (looking guilty) you look stunning babe!\n\nI knew he was avoiding my question but his statement was enough to melt me to pieces. I let him be.\n\nHe held out his arm and I hooked my hands in his.\n\nMe: (in the car) are you driving towards Umhlanga?\n\nImraan: yeah.\n\nMe: where are we going?\n\nImraan: you’ll see!\n\nI sighed.\n\nImraan smirked.\n\nHe drove to the Umhlanga pier and turned into a parking spot. He switched off the engine.\n\nImraan: (turning to me) I want to show you something.\n\nMe: (confused) uh okay.\n\nImraan: you remember that time you wanted to know what I did with the two million I borrowed from maseeha.\n\nMe: yeah?\n\nImraan: I never told you why because I wanted it to be completed first.\n\nMe: what are you talking about?\n\nHe got off the car and walked over to my side. He opened the door and held out his hand, I hesitantly took it and got out. What on earth was he going on about?\n\nImraan: I’ve been working on this since my grandfather passed away. I know that I have a lot of money and I am very grateful for it. But I wanted something more you know, something that was mine because of my hard work. My parents said that I will never be able to do it, but here I am. I did it.\n\nMe: (completely confused) imraan, I would love it if you tell me what it is that you are talking about. Like this I have no idea what is going on.\n\nImraan: (looking at his watch) I can’t tell you amira. But I can show you! He held me shoulder and turned my body to face away from the beach. The new flats that my father and I had passed months back was fully built.\n\nMe: imraan. I still don’t… (I stopped, my hand mid-air, and watched as the building lights lit up. It finally dawned upon me what imraan wanted me to see) oh…my…word.\n\nImraan put his hand around my shoulder.\n\nMe: is that? Is it? (He grinned) No Way!!\n\nI blinked over and over again but the writing still read the same words: “MOTALA MANOR”\n\nImraan: want to see inside? Nobody else has seen it yet. Except for me…and maseeha…and my parents.\n\nI took his hand and he led me to the grand gates. The flat was impressive to the eyes and left me in awe. There were nine flats in total and he already had renters for all nine. Each room was the same yet different and designed by an internationally renowned interior designer. He showed me each room and as we went up a floor is was more and more surprised.\n\nImraan: and now for the best of all, my personal favourite. (He went up the last step)\n\nMe: wait I thought you said there were nine flats?\n\nImraan: nine up for rent! This one is a little special. Amira motala I present to you (he swung the door open) the motala manor penthouse!\n\nMe: please tell me that I’m not dreaming! It’s would just be too horrid otherwise.\n\nImraan: (laugh) come in.\n\nWe both stepped in and I took in the beauty of my surroundings. Oh my word! This place is (laugh) wow!!!\n\nI ran my hand over the lean white leather couches, a cool breeze blew in from the huge sliding glass doors which were opened fully to reveal the crystal blue waters of a big pool. A few relaxer chairs were placed nearby.\n\nMe: wow! Imraan, this is really stunning!\n\nImraan: (smile) just like its owner!\n\nMe: you already got a buyer?\n\nImraan: well…you could more or less say that.\n\nI nodded and walked toward the glass doors and stepped into the roof terrace. The pool glistened and brightened the outdoor area. A set of loungers were lined on a grass patch and beautiful gardens decorated the corners of the terrace and spot lights lit up every meter.\n\nFour steps led me down to four single seaters that were placed around a glass table. Another glass door lay open to reveal a long dining table. A twirled staircase crawled upwards with glass sides. To say I was in awe of the design of this place would be a huge understatement. I still couldn’t believe that imraan had this place built. It was just too unimaginable.\n\nA huge arch led us back to the white couches.\n\nImraan: (plopping himself on the couch) I think you will like it here hey! What do you think?\n\nMe: (shocked) no! Oh no way!! You wouldn’t!\n\nImraan: (smile) well I think I would! (Smirk) for you? Definitely!\n\nMe: no! You lying! Tell me you lying imraan!\n\nImraan: (standing up) I would be lying if I did (wink)\n\nAfter that I have no idea what I even said. I was so excited I literally leaped into his arms and flung my hands around his neck.\n\nMe: (into his neck) you are the best!\n\nImraan: I know.\n\nMe: are we going back to the hotel?\n\nImraan: no. We have our own hotel here. And it’s even better. It’s our hotel home.\n\nI smiled.\n\nOur home.\n\nImraan: but if you want we could go back.\n\nMe: (pulling away from him) no! I like it here. And plus there is more Baraka when a newlywed spends the night at their home.\n\nI recalled the bayaan I attended a few weeks back. I was shocked out of my wits when the lady had told us this. The whole, staying at a hotel thing was so normal to me it was absurd to think of a newlywed stay at home. It was just so “shame!” But I guess it’s really not that big of a deal. In fact, it’s actually better. Also, different. I liked different.\n\nImraan: (slumping his shoulders) oh thank goodness. I didn’t really book the night. (Scrunching his nose) would have been hard to book a room so last minute. (I laughed and hugged him again)\n\nTugging at his hands, I insisted we do the tour all over again, this time knowing that everything was mine. It was even better than before. I spent a long time in the kitchen, playing with the new machines and admiring the fridge. Everything was perfect. It was one crazily perfect dream kitchen. The flat wasn’t that huge. It wasn’t even that big. It was plain and simple, no clutter, and everything was spaciously and thoughtfully set out to give it an exclusive look. It was, so to say, dainty.\n\nWhen I nagged him to dip my feet in the pool he bent down and picked me up. With me kicking and screaming he sent me forward with a jolt and I closed my eyes and screamed. Five seconds later I realized I was still in his arms. Safe.\n\nImraan: did you really think I was going to do it?\n\nMe: puhlease!! I knew you wouldn’t! You too scared!\n\nImraan: oh really? Okay then let’s see…\n\nHe started to walk closer to the pool and I put my arms around his neck and held on tightly.\n\nMe: imraan no! Please! I’m sorry I didn’t mean it. You are not scared, you are the bravest. Serious.\n\nPleased with my pleading comments, he laughed and put me down.\n\nImraan: come, you didn’t see the rooms.\n\nHe started to walk back inside and then turned back around. I stood on the same spot he put me down.\n\nImraan: what now?\n\nMe: (puppy face) my feet are sore.\n\nImraan: no! Walk yourself.\n\nI showed him my best sad face.\n\nImraan stubbornly stood there but I didn’t barge. He sighed, walked back to me and picked me up.\n\n*present day*\n\nMy cell phone alarm shrilled through the air and I jumped up with a sudden shock. Running to my clutch, I abruptly opened it and pulled out my phone. I was fast to put the shrilling sound off. Heaving a sigh of relief, I turned around to see if it woke Imraan up. He was sound asleep.\n\nAnnoyed that the alarm took away my going down the memory lane moment, I treaded to the bathroom and brushed my teeth. I brushed my hair into a neat pony, applied some lip balm and straightened out my clothes.\n\nImraan was still sound asleep so I crawled back into my side. I turned my back facing him.\n\nFive minutes later I was still awake. I turned on my back and sighed, staring at the ceiling. I turned my face and looked at imraan. He was still lying on his back. Mahn, I thought I was a late sleeper. How long does this guy sleep for?\n\nA smile formed on my face as an idea came to my mind. I imagined him rubbing his nose and messing his face with cream. It was an old joke me and the girls would do whenever we had a sleepover. Whoever got up first always did it to someone. You would put some cream on the persons hand and then tickle their nose so that they will rub all the cream on their face when they try to stop the itching. It was hilarious to watch the victim get up in confused shock. Once we did it to my grandfather, you can imagine the shouting we got, but the laugh was totally worth it. I let out a soft giggle.\n\nImraan: (his eyes still closed) don’t even think about it!\n\nMy smile disappeared and I kept silent trying to figure out if he really just spoke or was I dreaming?\n\nImraan: (opening one eye and turning his face slightly to look at me) I know what you thinking and don’t you dare.\n\nMe: I wasn’t… (He opened his eye again) okay fine. I was. (He closed his eye and smiled) but I won’t considering what a prank pooper you are! (I gave him a playful shot on his chest)\n\nImraan: that’s my girl! (Smirk)\n\nMe: how do you even know what I was thinking?\n\nImraan: it helps when you pay attention to your sister’s excitement and babbling after she returns from a sleepover with a girl who is crazy.\n\nMe: (rolling my eyes) so you were awake this whole time?\n\nImraan: I’m a very light sleeper! But that alarm of yours would have woke up even the dead! Why on earth would you even set an alarm for yourself the day after your wedding?\n\nMe: I didn’t. Your sister did. She apparently thought it was funny!\n\nImraan: sisters! (Groan) so what do you want for breakfast?\n\nMe: (evil smile) you really want to know?\n\nImraan: no! I just asked out of curtesy. I’m choosing today!\n\nMe: (sad face) you are so mean.\n\nImraan: (he turned to his side and faced me) okay then, where you want to go?\n\nMe: I want to have breakfast at home!\n\nImraan: what! Since when do you pick breakfast at home?\n\nMe: since I live in probably the most amazing penthouse in Africa. (Making a statement) breakfast at home! I’m making!\n\nI jumped out of the bed and slipped on my shoes.\n\nImraan: oh no! (Sarcastic voice) it’s going to rain money in Durban. Amira is making breakfast.\n\nI stuck my tongue out at him and walked out of the room. I heard Imraan shouting out from the room: “don’t forget to wash your hands before you cook, honey” then he let out a loud laugh like he just made the funniest joke ever. Gosh he is crazier than I thought!\n\nHalf an hour later I managed to cook up half a storm. Imraan sat at the counter giving his annoying comments while I rocked up the best breakfast I could possibly make. We took it out to the terrace which was even more beautiful during the day.\n\nImraan: it’s actually pretty good hey! Not so bad. (Smirk)\n\nMe: oh please, admit it! Its way better than any restaurant.\n\nImraan: okay. It was. It was better than any other breakfast I have ever tasted.\n\nMe: (raising my eye) even maseeha’s?\n\nImraan: aah you know nobody makes better than her. Not even my mother!\n\nMe: (laugh) true. (Thinking face) though I have never tasted your mother breakfast! I hardly even speak to your mother. Oh gosh, I’m such a terrible daughter in law.\n\nImraan: (laughing) would you chill. We not even married for twenty four hours and you already stressing about in laws!\n\nMe: uh helloww! Indian girls stress about in laws before they can even learn to spell the word!\n\nImraan burst out laughing and nearly choked on his cappuccino.\n\nWe made a quick stop at my (old) house to greet and I was surrounded by people literally jumping down my throats. Somehow everyone still seemed to be around and the house still buzzed with people. All the children shyly smiled at me and gave me hugs, the teenagers stared me down with curiosity and the old aunties never let me go without the questions. I managed to get out of the kitchen crowd and ran up to look for Sabeeha. I found her in the room shuffling through her bag. She was super thrilled to see me and I filled her in about my new home. She was surprised and we both squealed in excitement. I didn’t chat long with her but it was long enough. She told me she would be around for two weeks or so with my mother so I would see her again.\n\nWe then stopped at Imraan’s house. Thankfully, there wasn’t as many people that crowded me this time but it was a little harder considering the fact that I knew practically nobody. And I was the bride. I greeted my mother in law and then scanned the place for a familiar face and saw naseema and maseeha giggling and running toward me. They both pulled me into a room and drilled me with questions.\n\nMe: guys. Will you’ll calm down!\n\nNaseema: you are married! (Jumping up and down) you are married!\n\nMaseeha: we would ask you many more questions (wink) but I think I will pass (scrunching her nose) it’s really annoying that you married to my brother. (Sigh) but! It’s also (her eyes lighting up) AHHMAZZZING! You are my sister in law!!\n\nNaseema: where are you two going for honeymoon? He didn’t tell us.\n\nMe: The Maldives. Lily beach resort.\n\nThey both “awed”\n\nMe: is this…is this Imraan’s room?\n\nMaseeha: correction: his ex-room.\n\nMe: (shaking my head at her) ex? Seriously?\n\nMaseeha: it’s true. (Looking behind me) brother!! It’s so good to see you! (I turned around and as expected, Imraan stood behind me) oh come here (she ran and gave him a hug and faked an accent) oh I have missed you so very dearly.\n\nImraan: (shaking his head) I’ve only been away one night! (he tapped her head and she scrunched her nose and pulled away)\n\nMaseeha: but still.\n\nMe: well you can always visit us. At our penthouse. (Huge smile)\n\nNaseema and maseeha both looked at imraan.\n\nNaseema: you told her?\n\nMaseeha: I thought you said only when you get back from honeymoon.\n\nImraan: (shrugging his shoulders) guess I couldn’t wait.\n\nWe had lunch and then left for the airport. My mother and her troupe of people were already there. We had to check in early so we said our goodbyes and boarded the gates. After a long wait we finally boarded our flight and we were off.\n\nImraan and I had nice seats in the plane. It was just the two of us, me by the window and him on the aisle. Once everyone was settled in and we were in the air, the airhostesses came around with drinks. I ordered myself an orange juice and a coke and Imraan got appletiser.\n\nMe: how can you even stand appletiser?\n\nImraan: its good stuff.\n\nMe: (yawn) whatever you say Mr. Motala. (I interlocked our fingers) I’m just glad I have you.\n\nImraan looked over at me and smiled and I leaned my head on his shoulder and, with a huge smile, closed my eyes. It was going to be a long flight…\n\nSometimes the best thing you can do is to not think, not do, not wonder, not imagine, not obsess. just breathe and have faith that everything will work out for the best.\n\nA kite breezed through the air in the far distance, a troop of dogs wandered the streets, guests started to arrive in droves all dressed to the nines and caterers ran about frantically preparing for the function ahead. I smiled as I watched my mother greet every single female guest at the entrance of the tent. From naseema’s bedroom i could clearly see everything happening. my eyes could see it all played out but somehow my heart still couldnt believe. The huge tent was split into two portions, one for males and one for females. Even the entrances and exits were completely separate to ensure no mixing. At Least they followed one of my instructions.\n\nA wave of nervousness came over me when i spotted the car at the entrance. Imraan’s car!\n\nA squeal of excitement cut through the air as maseeha burst into the room.\n\nMaseeha: Aaamiiirraaaaa!!!! You are marriiieed!! Can you believe it?\n\nMe: well…it didn’t hit me as…\n\nI was cut off by someone clearing their throat. Not realizing that the sound was from out the door, I looked at maseeha confused.\n\nMaseeha: ooh the groom has arrived. (smirk. mahn that motala smirk!)\n\nI widened my eyes.\n\nMaseeha winked at me and giving a loud giggle, scurried out. I turned around, my eyes fixated on the ajar door. Imraan and maseeha said something to each other and i heard maseeha run down the stairs in her heels.\n\nHe gave a slight cough and pushed the door open. My mouth dropped. Literally.\n\nImraan: (grin) as salaamu alaikum.\n\nIm not sure whether I even had the voice to greet back but I mumbled something, my head still trying to wrap around the way imraan was dressed.\n\nI recalled the day imraan had asked me through maseeha what he should wear and I had made a joke and suggested arab style.\n\nI smiled.\n\nImraan: what? You don’t like it?\n\nAnd suddenly a wave of confidence came over me.\n\nMe: oh I like it. I just didn’t think that you would actually listen to me. (Smirk) do i have that an effect on you Mr Motala? (He looked down with a grin and i paused) you really have a thing for me don’t you? (puppy face) (Woah. Where did that even come from)\n\nHe smiled. Yes he just smiled. No comment. No comeback. Urgh.\n\nMe: so you not going to say anything?\n\nHe took a step closer to me and took my hand. A wild fire set off inside of my tummy.\n\nImraan: you look amazing!\n\nI blushed. A lump formed in my throat.\n\nImraan: (coming closer) did you hear our nikah?\n\nI swallowed and tried to say something. No voice seemed to come out. I nodded.\n\nImraan: (coming even more closer) you ready for the function?\n\nNod.\n\nImraan: so i will only get to see you after the function then?\n\nNod.\n\nBy now his cheek was touching mine and i could hear his soft breathing. I held my breath and swallowed again. My heart thumped so loud i was afraid it would explode. He let out a soft laugh and he bowed his head. I could feel his breath through my scarf.\n\nImraan: yes mrs motala, i really have a thing for you. But something tells me that the reason you holding your breath so tight is not just because you nervous. (I shuffled) (He looked straight into my eye with a huge smirk on his face) you really have a thing for me don’t you?\n\nAnd he was gone.\n\nI let go of the breath i was holding and let out a huge sigh. How was it even possible that one person can have such a huge effect on me?\n\nIt wasn’t long before the girls came running upstairs to fetch the bride. With wide grins and chirpy giggles they helped me downstairs and with a gulp of breathe, I ducked into the huge tent.\n\nThe setup was spectacular.\n\nThe entire tent was full of pink. The tent roof was lined with pink flowers and chandeliers. The floor was lined with a tiled platform and round tables filled the place up. Each table was styled with a huge bouquet of flowers in the centre. A long table at the front was styled similarly to the round ones and decorated with cakes and desserts of every style and color. The ladies cheered and awed as I walked in with a crowd of girls behind me. Naseema’s wedding nasheed mix blared through the speakers and as soon as I took my seat at the main table in the middle, the excitement filled the air. Children ran about collecting chocolates and mini bags, ladies chatted away while they munched on chevra and seatmeats, there was a buzz that could be heard from the mens side and every now and again there would be sudden bursts of laughter. The atmosphere was buzzing with excitement.\n\nNaseema: (speaking loudly over the nasheed) No way!!!\n\nMe: I know I can’t believe I’m married too!\n\nwahidullah started to play.\n\nNaseema: no! I mean yeah I can’t believe that you married but no way as in NO WaY!!!! Did you see what Imraan is wearing???\n\nMe: (laugh) I think he looks nice!\n\nNaseema: nice? Nice my foot! From what I recall, I chose a perfectly tailored tuxedo that cost a fortune and was perfect for today. I went shopping for an entire day with a sore tooth so that he could have the perfect suite. What was he thinking? (Pause) Oh wait why am i asking that, I don’t think he was thinking at all!\n\nI laughed.\n\nSabeeha: who wasn’t thinking?\n\nMe: she is upset because Imraan didn’t tell her he is wearing arab style.\n\nNaseema: I am not upset! I am…\n\nSabeeha: (cutting her off) he wore arab style?? What? (laugh) Are you guys talking about the same Imraan Motala i know?\n\nNaseema: see? Even sabeeha is shocked!\n\nMaseeha: I see my brothers wedding outfit has spiked up much talk. Everyone seems to be discussing it. Good idea Amy!\n\nNaseema: wait! This was Amira’s idea? (Looking at me)\n\nMe: well…I think he looks nice!\n\nEveryone laughed and Naseema shook her head.\n\nMe: what?\n\nA crowd of ladies all wearing the same uniform walked in with platters in their hands, the tent suddenly got louder and everyone started digging in to the menu that was picked out by my mother and prepared by, according to her, some of the best cooks in KZN.\n\nFirst came the starters: greek salad with almond dressing, chicken spring rolls, sweetcorn samosas and crumbed chicken wings. The main meal followed: chicken karai with buns, butter chicken and lemon rice, grilled prawns served with garlic bread and chips.\n\nI honestly have no idea how anyone would be able to eat so much. I was already filled with one samosa leave alone a long list of main meals.\n\nBut the food just never seemed to end.\n\nTea was served with cakes of every type and flavor, and for those who needed to cool off, there were desserts of all kinds. Mini ice cream tubs went around and the kids trailed behind the waitresses for extra helpings.\n\nI didn’t eat much. I couldn’t.\n\nThere were already too many eruptions and somersaults in my tummy and no matter how delicious the food looked and smelt, I just couldn’t seem to even eat one spring roll. So while my friends dug into the platters as if they never saw food before, I dished out a little rice and nibbled at it. I wonder if Imraan ate anything. (what? he is my husband now)\n\nIt wasn’t long before my mother came to fuss over me. Why wasn’t I eating properly? Was my bags ready for later? Did I greet haseena foi?\n\nI waited for naseema to finish her garlic bread and after washing our hands, sat down to greet everyone. My mother had me greet every single female, from my mother in law (got to get used to saying that) right down to my preschool teacher.\n\nMe: mum! Do you not know the definition of a small function??\n\nMum: (confused face) why? Is it too small? I knew I should have invited that family from…\n\nMe: (cutting her off and laughing) MUMmy!!\n\nMum: (laughing) I know! I know. (Sigh) I’m sorry my angel. You know how your mother can get a little carried away sometimes. I just wanted everything to be perfect. (Smile)\n\nMe: (smile) it is!\n\nAs much as I would have wished for her to do it simple and according to the Shariah, it was a little too late. I wanted so badly for everyone to see weddings and everything else the way I did now, but something I heard from a friend really touched my heart. She said that when you try to change for the better and better your life, you cannot expect it from the rest of the world. And some people, when they start to become more religious, they start to focus on how wrong everyone is and how right they are. They become intolerant. And I didn’t want to be that person.\n\nMy mother gave me a hug and kissed me on my forehead. And for the first time in years I realized that my mother didn’t have to fake a smile, this time it was real. This time she really was happy and content. Maybe it was a little bit crazy that an extravagant wedding for her daughter was all it took to make her happy, maybe it was silly. But it made her happy right? Thats all that matters.\n\nMe: mahn if I knew getting your daughter married would make you this happy I would have married a long time ago.(grin)\n\nMum: oh I’m not happy because you got married!\n\nMe: really?? You look happy to me!\n\nMum: uh yeah! Imraan motala just got married! Who wouldn’t be happy? (Throwing her hands up)\n\nWe both burst out laughing.\n\nThe rest of the evening passed by just like the day, spectacular but like a blur. Like a dream.\n\nThe guests started to leave and the catering people started clearing up. Naseema and maseeha helped me to get into the house with my huge gown. They insisted I walk the aisle to go out and they giggled like kids when I took up their dares. Naseema pretended to be a cameraman and walked backwards in front of me while maseeha pretended to throw confetti. Sabeeha held my gown. we all laughed so hard when we reached the end of the tent. We all stopped laughing when Imraan coughed. I could see them giggle and my face turned red. Then Naseema did the most ridiculous thing by insisting that Imraan and I walk the aisle. Imraan seemed to be all up for it. My face was scarlet the entire time.\n\nAn hour later, I found myself sitting next to imraan, in the Range Rover. He refused to tell me where he was taking me.\n\nImraan: so we going to spend the night here and tomorrow night we fly out to The Maldives for the week. We will be back in time for the walima.\n\nI kept silent.\n\nImraan: If you not happy with the place I can always change it.\n\nMe: (turning to him) do I ever say no to a good holiday?\n\nImraan: well, you do say no to good food most of the time so I wouldn’t be surprised.\n\nMe: I do not say no to good food! You dont even know good food!\n\nImraan: says the girl who prefers cornflakes over cheerios!\n\nI just rolled my eyes and he laughed, clearly chuffed at his win by having the last say. Imraan pulled in to the hotel and immediately I recognized it. Southern Sun Elangeni. He helped me out of the car and held up my gown so it was easy for me to walk. I waited in the foyer while he checked us in at the main desk. Everyone that passed by found it very exciting to see a bride in the foyer and greeted me with a congratulations. Little girls passed by, their eyes in awe. I smiled and waved at them and then joined imraan and he led me to the elevator.\n\nOur suite was cute and comfy. In a normal situation, I would run in and dive onto the bed with a huge leap. But I was in a huge wedding gown and this was not a normal situation. Not to me. As soon as the handle beeped and flashed green, my heart began beeping like it was having an attack. Imraan settled our bags on the corner and turned around. I could hear my heart loudly thumping against my chest.\n\nImraan: so…\n\nSilence.\n\nImraan: I…I have something I want to read to you.\n\nMe: (raised eyebrow) yeah sure…I’m listening.\n\nHe pulled out a folded paper that was tucked in his kurta pocket and opened it. He came closer to me, making me even more nervous as ever, and cleared his throat. I curiously listened in as he read.\n\nMy dearest and most beloved Amira, my wife\n\nThere is so much that I would love to tell you in my all so romantic speech that I have attempted to prepare, so much that I wish you would know, and yet I cannot seem to find the right words or the right way in which to say it to you. Because the feelings that I have been so fortunate to experience today cannot in any romantic way be explained. No 26 letter of the alphabet can collaborate to fathom what I felt, no oxford dictionary word can clarify the exhilaration that ran through my blood and no professor can summon up the perfect quote for the chemicals that combusted within my veins. At that very moment, the moment when a crowd of hundreds turned to face me, I felt it. At that very moment when my tongue uttered the words that would bound me with a partner for life, I felt it. It was an emotion that overpowered every emotion ever recorded. A feeling of happiness, joy, excitement, exhilaration and pure relief all topped with a litre of a sensation unknown to man. And in that moment, as I felt my blood rush through my body filling every bout of flesh, as I felt the excitement rush through me and I was a hundred and one percent sure that Obama could hear my heart beating all the way from America, I knew. I knew what love really meant.\n\nSo my beloved zawjati, as we stand here on the day of our nikah I want you to know that from the moment that I uttered the words of acceptance, I promised our lord that I will love you not just until death but to Jannah. And I should warn you that maybe, there will come a time when I will love another girl as much as I love you. Because I am sure that if I have such love for you, what would the love of our little girl be like? But I promise to not over love her, just in case you might feel a little left out. And when I catch her and give her a spin, just so that I can hear her laugh echo through our home, I promise to do the same for you. And no matter how much you scream at me to put you down I won’t. Not until I hear your laugh echo too. And when we stop to buy ice cream for our little boy, I won’t forget to get you a serving too. And I’m sorry if I’m freaking you out by mentioning kids on our wedding night, I really have no intentions to do so. I just want you to know that no matter who or what comes into our lives, you will always remain as my one and only most crazy, beautiful and amazing wife.\n\nSo I think I am going to conclude my attempt of a romantic speech but first I would like to apologize. I am not very good with words but I did try. And I hope that it was even a little bit close to an actual romantic speech.I dont know about you but I think I did a pretty good job. (He shuffled and put his hand in his pocket) I know that you must have wondered why we didn’t do this at the wedding itself like a usual couple and I am sorry if it made you feel upset that we didn’t. I just thought it would be better if it was just us. Just you and I.\n\nHe opened the box that he pulled out of his pocket and went down on his knees.\n\nThe strikingly attractive ring shone in my eyes. It was gold plated with diamonds lining the side. A huge diamond sat in the middle and was accompanied by two smaller ones on either side. A line of six tiny diamonds were next to these two. It was a piece of perfection.\n\nSo, Amira Motala, will you be my wife, my soul mate and my partner in crime?\n\nHaraam love is like salty water, no matter how much you drink from it, it will never quench your thirst. on the contrary, it will increase it. But Halaal love will not only quench your thirst, but it will also refresh you. Halaal love is just like fresh water, it is full of affection, peace and mercy. Islam didn’t make it Haram for you to fall in love. It didn’t forbid you from wanting someone. It only guides that love so it protects you and especially saves you from humiliation on judgment day. And if you really love eachother, then you wouldn’t hesitate to make that love halaal.\n\nI stood in front of the long length mirror and eyed the girl that stared back at me. Maseeha and Sabeeha (with naseema for the side comments and complaints) really knew what they were doing in all that hustle bustle to have the bride ready. Three hours. It took three hot and crazy hours to have me looking like a model out of a bridal magazine. And even I had to admit that they out did themselves and did an amazing job. I took a deep breath as I glanced at myself for the last time as a miss. The gown my mother chose was really a stunner. It was pure white and flowed down regular gown style. The entire gown was laced from the neck with a wide lacy pattern that gave it a simple yet elegant look. My mother had the designer to make a matching scarf. It set perfectly on my head with the crystal piece that Sabeeha attached to it. My feet was gloved by a gorgeous Francesca shoe. The Francesca is embellished with crystal and mother of pearl shell embroidery, and is made in soft blush leather with a metallic rose gold trim. One small adjustment to my gown before I leave to listen to my nikah. It was going to be a long spectacular evening…\n\nFlashback:\n\nThree weeks….I had three weeks. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. You can do this Amira!\n\nEventually I did end up getting some sleep that night. It came at around three in the morning but after all the panic and mental planning I finally fell off to sleep. Two days of mulling around was all my family allowed. By Monday, the preparations were in full swing. My mother called the madressa and arranged for leave for me. Let me warn you that all my threats to keep it small just never seemed to get into anyone’s head. It was like whatever I said was blatantly ignored. After hours of debating, they finally agreed that the wedding will be at Naseema’s house (her mother offered after I insisted we have a home wedding and my mother reasoned that our garden wasn’t wedding material). Her garden was huge and would make the perfect venue for a garden wedding. Despite my mother’s persistence to have it at NMJ (according to her, the wedding wasn’t good enough if it were anywhere else) I managed to convince them that it would be more unusual for a garden wedding and would spike up more talk. This seemed to have pleased her, in fact everyone was satisfied and the decision was final, garden wedding it would be. Then came the debate about what I was to wear. With the hall I had my way but with this one I wasn’t winning. There were too many of them and I was fighting a losing battle. They insisted I wear a gown.\n\nI have no idea what it is with this traditional customs and the funny tales. Seriously, my mother’s eyes nearly popped out when I offered to wear a normal dress instead. I mean it’s not like I was asking to wear rags or something. The dress I chose was actually really gorgeous. But no matter how much I bargained, she didn’t barge. Gown it would be.\n\nI didn’t argue when they set the theme colour pink. Apparently it was the colour of universal love, and according to Sabeeha, it is the sweet side of the colour red.\n\nOnce the big things (deciding factors only, mind you) were sorted out, the actual preparations started. With the preparations my family was doing I just wanted to get the wedding over with then and there. If this was what they called a small wedding what in the world would they have done if I asked for a big one? It was only during this time when the actual reality of the happenings almost hit me. Almost.\n\nThen came the call…\n\nA week after the preparations were in second phase and me still trying hard to accept that this was really happening, I woke up to my loud ringtone in the early hours of the morning, still half asleep I answered my cell phone in a rush to get the loud ringtone to stop.\n\nMe: (sleepy voice) salaam alaikum.\n\nImraan: Wa alaikum salaam sunshine.\n\nMe: (jolting up) imraan?!\n\nYou were not even supposed to speak to him amira! Put the phone down now!\n\nImraan: do you realise the amount of times you say my name in that tone?\n\nOkay let me just see what he wants. Maybe it’s important.\n\nMe: what do you want?\n\nImraan: well I know I should have done the right thing and be a good boy and call your grandfather but I think I should ask you first.\n\nUh-oh. That doesn’t sound good.\n\nMe: ask me what?\n\nImraan: I… (*2 minutes of silence*) I uh…\n\nMe: you what?\n\nImraan: I…can we move the wedding?\n\nMy mouth dropped. I readjusted the phone and my palms suddenly got really sweaty.\n\nOh no.\n\nMe: what?\n\nImraan: I know that this is coming as a shock and it will be a little difficult to get everything ready so fast but honestly it’s only been a week and it feels like a year! And I know this is so sudden but do you think you can pull a wedding in a week?\n\nDoes this guy know the difference between move and bring forward?\n\nMe: what? Are you insane? A week? You want to get married in a week?\n\nImraan: well when you put it that way you make it sound like I’m asking you to get married now.\n\nMe: you might as well do that!\n\nImraan: really?\n\nMe: imraan!\n\nI could hear his smirk through the phone.\n\nImraan: so can I call your grandfather or not?\n\nMe: (considering) you might be able to bargain with my grandfather but I don’t think you going to get through to my mother that easily. She is going to freak. As it is three weeks was way too less time for her.\n\nImraan: so you agree?\n\nMe: I already told you…\n\nImraan: (cutting me off) just answer the question?\n\nGosh he is so difficult sometimes.\n\nMe: okay fine. Yes I agree.\n\nImraan: you do? (To himself) Wow. I never thought it would be this easy.\n\nMe: good luck with my mother!\n\nI cut the call and dropped my head into my pillow. What have I gotten myself into? Was I even thinking straight?\n\nThat afternoon, my grandfather gave everyone the news at the supper table (after consulting with me-he didn’t know I already knew) don’t ask me how imraan did it but he had my mother agree. That boy really surprises me more and more each day. Naseema was the one with the biggest dramatic reaction. She was really acting like imraan asked me to marry him on the spot. Eventually she came around with the idea. The rest of the week passed in a complete blur and my family successfully put together my wedding in the few days that they had, not wasting a single second of it. My house was filled with aunties and cousins that I never knew even existed within hours of the announcement and their “preparation party” was in full swing.\n\nI never saw teamwork run so smoothly in my life. Not even for eid. My mother had everyone working day and night to have everything ready. From the kunchas to the mini bags to give out at the wedding, she had all the preparations in progress. She didn’t make me do much, even if I wanted to, just fitting on clothes and approving of certain things. Luckily Maseeha was up and down between the houses so she helped to choose Imraan’s stuff. She described to me a few of the ones they were making for me, it sounded like they too were having a blast putting together such a quick wedding.\n\nMy mehndi was put on Wednesday afternoon by a professional that my mother hired. She was a talented lady and her patterns were unique and stunning and left us all in awe. Another mehndi artist was brought in to do the girls and ladies of the house. She also did a beautiful job.\n\nOn Thursday night, the Motala family had supper at my house. They brought the trays one time with them and my room was literally shrouded with the trays that they made for me. The supper was amazing and the wedding atmosphere seem to have settled in for everyone beside me. There were so many people and the buzz in the air made me shiver. Everyone that I have ever loved was there, minus Imraan. And my father. I smiled across the room at my step-father and made a silent wish for my father to have been there. I wonder if he would be proud of me if he was here. I wonder if he will give me a squeeze and tell me that I will always be his princess no matter what. I snapped out of my thoughts when someone gave me a small nudge on my shoulder.\n\nMum: excited?\n\nMe: huh? (Looking up at her) oh. Yeah. Nervous actually.\n\nMum: ah you’ll be perfect. (Wink) you the princess remember?\n\nI flashed her a huge smile.\n\nMum: (hitting my shoulder with hers) your father will be proud of you, you know. Really proud. Jealous too (laugh) that you found your prince and no longer his princess. When you were born he always told me that we asked for a daughter but we got a princess.\n\nMe: (lump in my throat) I just wish he was here.\n\nMum: (smile) he is. Maybe not in person or soul. But he is here in memory sweetheart. And I know for sure that he would be so so proud of the lady that you have become. And so am I.\n\nI held back the tears that welled up in my eyes and smiled at my mother. How is it that she always knows exactly what to say?\n\nThat night when I got into bed and rested my head onto my pillow, it all came flowing to me like a huge wave that goes overhead. It was only then that it actually and truly dawned upon me that I was getting married. In my tummy, there was a circus going wild. In my head, there was a chemical party. In my heart, there was a race. I was getting married.\n\nPresent:\n\nI allowed myself one more glance at the mirror before I turned to go downstairs. The ladies gave a gasp of awe as I shyly lowered myself down the huge stairs leading to Naseema’s grand lounge. There were just a few ladies present, most of them my immediate family and friends and those who flew from Johannesburg and were staying at my house. I smiled and nodded at them as I passed and sat down next to my mother who planted a kiss on my forehead and muffled a cry. I gave her a tight squeeze and nervously smiled at Sabeeha as I sat down. Maseeha and naseema sat opposite us. A buzz of excitement filled the air and my tummy gave a somersault as the moulana on the receiver cleared his throat. The room fell silent. I could hear the slight sound of the aircon, the sound of the cutlery clink as the caterers rushed about doing last minute setting up outside, in the distance a drilling sound went off and trucks were reversing in and out doing their daily rounds. The room was suddenly filled with the booming voice of the moulana and my big day had officially begun…\n\nI listened, my ears gripping every word and my heart gripping every advice, as the khutbah was given. Then came the moment I had waited for my entire life. I squeezed my mother’s hand even tighter and once again the room fell silent as we waited. And then I heard him…\n\nHis voice was pure and profound. The voice of acceptance. The words rang in my ears like a sweet melody and set of a combustion in my tummy. And just like that, his promise was finally fulfilled, and in that moment, when imraan uttered the very words that bound us for life I didn’t just get a husband, I got the world…and I got it the halaal way!\n\nThis post is dedicated to a fellow blogger…silentliving. jazakallah nominating surtidiaries for the challenge. a challenge i truly enjoyed writing.\n\nAlso dedicated to all my dearest friends. i love you guys to bits.\n\ndont forget to comment below and let me know your thoughts…enjoy…\n\nNerves. nerves provides one with energy. when you don’t have them and you feel at ease, that is when you should be worried. after all, if you’re not nervous, it’s not important to you!\n\nMaseeha slammed her mug onto the kitchen counter and sabeeha had to hit her back to recover her from her coughing fit. we all stared at the phone in the middle of the table, our mouths agape.\n\nImraan: (after a few minutes) hello? you guys still there?\n\nmaseeha: (clearing her throat) tell me that you are kidding?\n\nhe kept silent.\n\nmaseeha: (sigh) gosh, when she said she messed up her life i really thought she was exaggerating.\n\nsabeeha: so she knows that she is preg…having a baby?\n\nimraan: i think thats why she freaked out and overdosed herself.\n\nme: (thinking out loud) thats why she wanted to see me.\n\nimraan: look, i don’t mean to cause any chaos but i don’t think she overdosed herself to take away her emotion. i think it was more than that.\n\nmaseeha: what do you mean?\n\nme: she tried to kill herself!\n\neveryone turned to look at me and i shrugged.\n\nimraan: yeah. thats what i mean. i think she was trying to commit suicide!\n\nsilence.\n\nimraan: hello?\n\nmaseeha: yeah we here. its like this situation is just getting worse and worse by the minute. do you think we should go to the hospital?\n\nimraan: i will be there in 15 minutes.\n\nmaseeha: yeah okay. we will be ready.\n\nshe cut the call and chucked her cell in her handbag.\n\nnaseema: (scrunching her nose) amira, where is your mothers car?\n\nme: we dropped it off at maseeha’s house and jumped in with imraan. no use taking two cars. (shrug)\n\nnaseema: (smirk) really? or is there any other reason you jumped in with imraan?\n\nme: oh get over yourself!\n\nmaseeha: oOh mY GoSH! i completely forgot to tell you guys. i think amira’s grandfather gave imraan a call. HE TOTALLY KNOWS!\n\nnaseema: hee hee hee…(slurping her coffee) i can imagine the road trip home.\n\nA car pulled into the driveway and honked.\n\nsaffiyya: i guess thats my cue guys. my baby is probably missing his mama too much (she placed her hand to her heart and made a sad face) i will see you’ll at the hospital.\n\nnaseema: (thinking out loud) hmm…i wonder which baby she is referring to…\n\nsaffiyya glared at her and stuck out her tongue. and we all laughed. she hugged each of us and let herself out.\n\nimraan picked us up on time and we all squashed (well there was plenty space but you know what i mean) in his car. maseeha sitting in the front. and naseema (unfortunately) next to me. she kept digging her elbow into my side and making her eyes all googly. i could see imraan’s smirk in the mirror every time she did that. i shyly looked down and ignored her.\n\nnaseema seemed to be way too jumpy and excited. maseeha too was excited, i could see, but she kept her calm and pushed aside the excitement for amina’s sake. i still wasnt ready to see amina when we reached the hospital. i was furious that she didn’t tell us and i knew if i went to see her i would say things that i would later regret. but i didn’t tell any of them. maseeha could see me jumpy and she offered to go and see how she is while i stayed in the foyer with naseema. imraan went somewhere unknown to us.\n\ni felt so ashamed and embarrassed that my own blood would ever do something that amina did and somehow the feeling of helping her seemed to be disappearing. i felt sick to my stomach. Here i was feeling bad for thinking that her drama was crashing my party, and here she was knowing all along that she was irreparable. i guess thats us humans, it’s only when the situation is “not that bad” that we attempt to fix it. we don’t even want to try when it has gone from normality to gobsmacking unbelievable. we like to stay in that little bubble of ours and help those in our reach without popping it. we go on saying that we will do everything we can do to help that somebody but then back down as soon as the waters get to cold. we are hypocrites of our own decisions.\n\nBut everything that we judge in others is something within ourselves we don’t want to face. we are conveniently very good lawyers when it comes to our own mistakes but when it comes to others, we are very good judges.\n\ni was so absorbed in my thoughts that i didn’t even realise that naseema was talking to me until she tugged at my abaya.\n\nnaseema: AMIRA!!!\n\nme: (snapping out of my thoughts) huh? oh sorry. what were you saying?\n\nnaseema: i was saying that i changed my mind. i am sorry that i said all of those things about amina. she is pretty messed up but she could do with the support. from what you guys are saying, she is ready to change hers…(she stopped and stared at the doorway, her face turning bright red with fury and shock all at once)\n\nme: naseema?\n\ni swung my head around to see what could have gotten that kind of a reaction out of naseema. A tall guy walked in with a bunch of roses in his hand. he was so familiar. i was so sure i seen those grey eyes somewhere. i looked back at naseema with an inquiry look on my face waiting for her to tell me. she looked like she had recognised them.\n\nnaseema’s eyes were filled with tears and she took in a huge gulp of air. and then it hit me. ahmed. ahmed ismail.\n\ni grabbed naseema and tried to pull her behind the vending machine that stood in the passageway.\n\nnaseema: i…he…ahmed. its ahmed. why did (hiccup)he have to be here? (she closed her eyes and wiped away the tears that fell. her face filled with pain. then she looked behind me and her face filled with fury once again) why is imraan talking to him?\n\ni turned around and low and behold. imraan was shaking ahmeds hand and talking to him.\n\nme: maybe i should go see. why dont you go to amina’s room? ill be there in a sec.\n\nshe nodded and turned to go. and i walked up to where imraan and ahmed was standing.\n\nme: imraan?\n\nthey both turned to me.\n\nme: uhm. do you think you can drop us off at the mall after this? (lame excuse to make my presence known but i am not one who is good at coming up with stories off hand)\n\nimraan: (quizzical look) sure.\n\nme: (looking at ahmed) ahmed right? how’s it going?\n\nimraan: you know him?\n\nme: yeah. he is ahmed ismail.\n\nahmed shuffled.\n\nimraans eyes narrowed.\n\nimraan: oh.\n\nme: so what brings you to netcare?\n\nimraans turn to shuffle.\n\nme: what? why are you both giving me that look?\n\nimraan: (through gritted teeth) can i speak to you for a minute amira?\n\ni nodded and he pulled me aside. far away from ahmeds hearing distance.\n\nimraan: how do you know ahmed?\n\nme: he…he is an old friend. (imraan clenched his fist) a jerk, if you must know.\n\nimraan: tell me about it!\n\nme: (my turn to narrow my eyes) huh?\n\nimraan: amira. lets try not to freak out okay.\n\nme: (getting nervous) that doesn’t make me any less afraid at what you’re about to say imraan.\n\nimraan: he is the father of amina’s child.\n\nthere comes a time when one is unable to handle the incidents played out in front of them. a time when a person reaches a point where everything becomes too much and the ball of fire becomes too big. a point where the combustion is forced out. a breaking point.\n\ni stared at imraan in utter disbelief and shook my head.\n\nme: NOOO!!! ITS IMPOSSIBLE!\n\neveryone stopped what they were doing and stared at us. i could see ahmed nervously shuffling in the seat he had taken.\n\nimraan: i am sorry amira. it is what it is. there is nothing we can do to change it. but like you said. he is a jerk, i don’t know why you say that about him. but for what he has done to amina. he is a jerk.\n\nme: WHY? OF ALL THE GUYS IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE HIM! WHY AHMED. (realising that i was creating a scene i lowered my voice) are you sure?\n\nimraan: yes. we ran the test thrice. why does it affect you so badly that it is ahmed?\n\nme: nothing, its just. nevermind. you won’t understand. (i turned to go but imraan grabbed my arm)\n\nimraan: no. i know there is something you not telling me. you wouldn’t have reacted like that if it wasn’t something bad.\n\nme: let me go imraan.\n\ni shrugged myself out of his grip and ran to the room. there was no way naseema could find out about this. i needed to get her out of this place. i burst into the room in a fit of breaths.\n\nme: (gasping for air) naseema…we…(i stopped)\n\nnaseema turned to me.\n\nnaseema: need to go!\n\ni watched her walk past me and then with a confused look followed her. she closed the room door and calmly turned to face me.\n\nnaseema: (her eyes welling up with tears once again) i know amira. amina told me!\n\nme: i am so sorry nas. you shouldnt have to go thr…\n\nnaseema: no. its okay. really. (wiping her tear away) it is what it is! (shrug) i mean its not like he was mine or anything. (she let out a small laugh) i think this is what i needed.\n\nme: what do you mean?\n\nnaseema: i spent the past few months wracking my brains with maybe’s. maybe it was a mistake. maybe it was just once. maybe he only realised he loved me after that. i wrecked myself everyday thinking that maybe, just maybe we would have ended up happily together if i just gave him a second chance. (pause) i guess its about time i face the reality of the truth.\n\nme: (smile) i am so proud of you. (giving her a squeeze) but if you want to go home now i don’t mind. and i’m cool if you don’t ever want to see amina again.\n\nnaseema: no. how could i ever think that. she might have made a really huge mistake and sin but the fact that he is involved doesn’t mean i must drop out. im okay with seeing her. i have no grudges.\n\ni smiled.\n\nnaseema: just one thing. (i looked at her questioningly) i still wish she brought this drama in any other time but now. i feel so annoyed we can’t celebrate properly.\n\ni laughed at her. her words really inspired me to not give up either on amina. maybe she was irreparable. but that doesn’t mean i shouldn’t try. its true what they say. choosing your friends is indeed very important.\n\nwith amina being pregnant, it would be impossible to send her to the rehab. they refused to accept her. imraan sat down with ahmed and spoke to him. he eventually agreed to marry amina. they flew down to johannesburg that afternoon to see amina’s parents. amina promised to come clean about everything. it wasn’t going to be easy but it was for the best. amina promised to keep us updated.\n\ni finally got to kick off my shoes and jump on my bed after a long dreadfully crazy day. i was mentally and physically exhausted. i indulged myself in a yummy bowl of popcorn and a huge mug of coffee and was in the middle of sorting out my assignments when i heard a knock on my door.\n\nnana: amira?\n\nme: jee. come in.\n\nhe pushed the door open and came in.\n\nnana: you busy?\n\nme: just sorting out my assignments. they never seem to come to an end. (he laughed) so, whats up nana?\n\nnana: i spoke to imraan’s parents. they want to come tomorrow to set the date.\n\nme: (looking at him dazed) to set the date? what da…ohmygosh…date! set the date!\n\nnana: (confused) yes. we agreed to have it with just us. the immediate family. they will be here for supper….\n\nmy nana’s words only dawned on me when i opened my eyes in the morning. don’t ask me how or when but i think i fell off to sleep while he was still there. because my coffee and popcorn was gone when i got up and my textbooks neatly kept on my dressing table. my eyes shot open in the morning. today they are setting the date!\n\nimraans parents were coming. what was i going to wear? how was i going to act? oh gosh, all this was so stressful for me. i wasn’t used to last minute functions…especially when i was the reason. i jumped out of my bed and logged onto my skype as fast as i could. thankfully naseema just came out of the shower.\n\nnaseema: chill girl. you will be fine.\n\nme: yeah but what must i wear? must i wear abaya or a dress? must i put make up or not? and what about shoes? heels or flats?\n\nnaseema: can you calm down! you acting like imraan is coming to see you!\n\nme: news flash! he is! now will you get your self down here. i need your assistance.\n\nnaseema: even bigger news flash. he already agreed to marry you so even if you wear your pj’s he can’t say anything. (pause) in fact, i think he might enjoy that idea.\n\ni glared at her.\n\nnaseema: (laughing) okay. okay. i will be there. soon.\n\nI had a quick shower and washed my hair. i like the idea of freshly washed and dried hair when there is a function. even though i wear scarf and nobody actually sees my hair. weird i know.\n\nnaseema eventually turned up-at midday- calmly strolling into my kitchen as if she couldn’t be bothered that today was the setting the date night. i grabbed her by the shoulders, dragged her upstairs and pushed her into my room.\n\nthree hours later, i walked out of my closet ready to face my future in laws. I glanced at myself in the long closet door mirror and smiled at naseema.\n\nnaseema managed to rummage through the clothes i owned and put together a stunner. she made me wear a plain black abaya that flowed like a dress from the hip down. she topped it up with a beige belt that gave my body a slick yet non revealing look. she chose a floral blazer to go over my abaya. it set just over the belt and as per her order, i buttoned only one button. a black suede pumps gloved my feet and my head was draped with a black scarf with a tiny line of floral stones. we opted for no make up. she smeared on a small amount of lip gloss and lined my eyes with kohl and i was ready. i looked casual yet amazing.\n\nme: not bad.\n\nnaseema: not at all.\n\nme: jazakallah so much.\n\nnaseema: go on. say it. tell me how you just cannot live without me! (she grinned and i stuck my tongue out at here) you look amazing!\n\nthe motala family had arrived and i nervously went to greet them.i plastered on a smile but inside i was dying with nerves. after sitting down for a small chat i excused myself and went up to my room for a breather. it was not easy talking to them. and the fact that i spoke to them for so many years like a normal person didn’t help. i was setting my scarf right when a saw a shadow at my door. i turned around.\n\nimraan: you really should stop stressing. you doing great.\n\nme: what are you doing here? you not supposed to be here!\n\nimraan: (holding his hand up) i know. i’m sorry. i thought maybe if you heard my voice you would be able to calm down.\n\nme: is it that obvious?\n\nimraan: (scrunching his nose) maybe. (pause) to me. everyone else doesn’t seem to pick it up.\n\nme: (rolling my eyes) yeah yeah. now go! if they see you here they will freak.\n\nimraan: (sigh) actually. it was your mother that sent me up.\n\nme: (raised eyebrow) oh really?\n\nimraan: not really. i just came to check on you. see if you okay you know.\n\nme: i am fine. now go!\n\nimraan: right! (turning to go) you look amazing by the way.(and he was gone. sighing, i went back downstairs)\n\nthe rest of the night went really well. the supper, made by my mother, was delicious. imraan’s mum and dad didn’t drill me with any scary questions like i imagined and maseeha was there to hold my hand whenever i felt nervous. imraan on the other hand was acting really weird. he had this smirk plastered on his face the entire time and he was being so shy. i wanted to laugh so badly but for ethical reasons, i had to hold it in. The hours flew by and before we knew it, we were seeing them off to their home.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. i couldnt. the excitement of getting married had not yet dawned on me. but what did was the nerves. i was suddenly nervous about everything. i couldn’t handle it. i felt like my tummy was going to burst into a billion sparks.\n\nThe date was set…and imraan and i were to be married in exactly three weeks…that was until he called…\n\n*drum roll*\n\nAnd todays post is for SHAAKZ-007. jazakallah for always commenting, like four times on each post *happy dance* i love it:) I know i might be a little late, but i wish you and all those out there who are in the midst of the exam fever and nerd season the very best. May you all be blessed with brilliant reports and results possible. Ameen. Enjoy the extra extra extra long post:) dont forget to comment below! *wink wink*\n\nI believe that everything happens for a reason. I have no reason not to. people change so that you can learn to let go. things go wrong so that you can appreciate them when they go right. and good things fall apart so that better things can fall together. And sometimes, you have to fall to fly.\n\nHow many times are we placed in a situation that suddenly opens our mind up to a whole new way of seeing things and there is this sudden change of heart? we often stuck in our bubble, and don’t realize the reality of things until we ourselves are faced with it. its like a mini earthquake that comes into our lives to give us a shake. to wake us up from our slumber and force us to face the harsh reality out there.\n\nMe: Amina? Uh…what…why would…\n\nImraan: (cutting me off) just come here. I will explain everything later. Right now you just need to get here.\n\nMe: okay. Where are you?\n\nImraan: meet me at the gym. The one near the beautician.\n\nMe: uh. Okay. I’ll be right there.\n\nI put the phone down and took a deep breath. To be honest, I had no idea where he was talking about. I wasn’t sure what he was talking about either. Amina? What was she doing there? And what did he mean when he said she was bad? I turned around and Maseeha stood in the doorway.\n\nMaseeha: where is he?\n\nMe: the gym. By the…\n\nMaseeha: (nodding) beautician. Let’s go. (thank gosh for fast learning friends)\n\nI quickly threw on my abaya and scarf and she grabbed her stuff and we ran out. The gym wasn’t that far from us and we got there in no time. The place was barren, except for an old truck that loomed in the area. Imraan was parked on the side of the building and we pulled in next to him. He got off his car as soon as we pulled in.\n\nImraan: its hard to explain this but maybe if you see you will understand.\n\nI shrugged at Maseeha and we followed him to his boot and Imraan explained to us what happened. his story was…crazy.\n\nMaseeha: and she just passed out?\n\nImraan: right in front of me.\n\nMaseeha: so you put her in your boot? And called us here?\n\nMe: are you feeling okay?\n\nImraan: I panicked okay. I didn’t know what to do. She scares me.\n\nMe: so you kidnapped her?\n\nImraan: I didn’t kidnap her! I am trying to help her!\n\nMaseeha: by kidnapping her?\n\nImraan: stop acting so ridiculous. This is a serious thing. I told you’ll I was getting into my car at the garage and she just came to me, she insisted that i take her to amira. before i knew it she was on the floor. out.\n\nMe: (taking a deep breath) this is so ridiculous! we need to get an ambulance. We have to get her to the hospital.\n\nWe called an ambulance for her and managed to get her out of the boot and into the stretcher successfully. Imraan drove us to the hospital.\n\nMaseeha: (in the car) so you telling me that you couldn’t think of getting her to the hospital? call a doctor?\n\nImraan: well…I didn’t. I\n\nMaseeha: (cutting him off) how can you be so silly Imraan? What if it’s something serious?\n\nMe: mas. (taking her hand) drop it!\n\nWe all kept silent.\n\nWe managed to not get ourselves in a frenzy at the hospital while filling in the forms. I answered whatever questions they asked and fibbed a lie about her parents being away. After a long wait they finally let us go in. before we could go see her, a doctor approached us with news as to what exactly was wrong with her.\n\nDoctor: we can tell it’s an over dosage. With what I’m afraid I cannot tell. Maybe you will know?\n\nMe: (choking a cough) overdose? As in drugs? (I held my breath at his reply)\n\nDoctor: yes ma’am. Is she an addict?\n\nMe: I…I don’t know!\n\nMaseeha: will she be okay?\n\nDoctor: she has a mild overdose. It might take a while to get her back to her usual state. But she will be fine. We will have to treat her for a few days. And do some tests. I would recommend rehabilitation. Girls her age ought not to be on drugs. It’s going to ruin her and will be fatal if not treated now. (you don’t say?)\n\nI stumbled backward trying to get my head straight on what he just said. Rehab. Drugs. What was my cousin doing to herself? And where was her parents while she was ruining her life?\n\nmight i add to you that i am not exposed to such a thing often, i do hear of it now and again, but for me it was just so farfetched. it was just too much for my mind to handle.\n\nI started feeling bad for cutting her out of my life after the whole incident with her. She had really made me angry with the stunt she pulled but I had no right to cut off ties with her. She was a good person with good morals and a spectacular character. That was the Amina I knew. And I was aware of what she was slowly becoming, I seen her first hand when she was gaga over Imraan by the way she had changed, her dressing, character, attitude, and yet I let it slip through my hands. And now it was almost too late. what would my father say if he knew how i had left her to ruin her life? he would be so disappointed in me if i didn’t help her out of this mess! but i am just about to start my life. i am about to be someones bride. this was supposed to be all about me. right? i am sure he would understand that.\n\nBecause that’s us humans, we only care about ourselves and our beings. It’s only about us. About me. About myself. as if we are the only ones on earth. We go around judging the whole world and frowning at the actions of others, and yet we never try to help. Yes, maybe we better ourselves, maybe we don’t do the sins that others do, but don’t they have a right to be helped? It could be us in those situations, us in the trap of shaitaan, so deep a cut it would be almost impossible to heal. Wouldn’t we want to be helped? Isn’t that our duty as Muslim brothers and sisters? Weren’t we supposed to have each others back. and you know what’s funny? If a friend had to ask us to “cover” for them when they out with a boy we so happily agree, when a friend wants us to join them for a movie we jump to the opportunity. But when our friends are screaming for help from the trap of shaitaan we do nothing but push them deeper, when there is a perfect time for us to give them the right advice we push it away thinking of how we would look “holy” and “old” and agree with whatever they say be it right or wrong. Is that what kind of friends we have become? Selfish egotistical people who could care less about the wrong our beloved friends and family are doing? And we go on saying that we are true friends…\n\nI snapped out of my thoughts when Maseeha grabbed my hand and pushed me to go inside the room. I hadn’t even realized that we had walked to the room. Opening the door, I braced myself for the worst and made a silent promise that whatever Amina needed to be helped I would do whatever was in my capability to make sure she is back on track. if not for her then for my father’s sake. I was done playing judge. Now It was time to play doctor.\n\nAmina: (sitting up slightly) please don’t tell my father.\n\nMe: we won’t. Not just yet. How are you feeling?\n\nAmina: (she muffled a cry) I’m so screwed over Amira. what am I going to do? (sigh)if my father saw me like this he will die. And my mother? She will be so upset.\n\nMe: hey. It’s going to be fine okay.\n\nAmina: just make this horrible life go away. (crying more) I just want to be back to myself. I don’t even know who I am anymore.\n\nMe: (taking her hand) it’s going to be fine. You will be fine.\n\nAmina: (shaking her head) I doubt that. I can never be fine. You have no idea what I’ve become. The things I’ve done. I’m ruined for life.\n\nMaseeha: no you not! (we both looked at her. She hadn’t spoken all this time) yeah you pretty much overdosed, probably addicted to some sick drug and lost all shame and modesty you had (I made big eyes at her but she carried on, ignoring me) and you practically screwed over. But you still have your eyes, your hands, legs, you still have your health, pathetically unstable right now, but you still have it! and this, as much as it sucks is your wake up call! the call is here, now you got to actually attempt to wake up. there are many people who will be able to help you with no questions, the question is, are you prepared to accept the help with an open hand?\n\nShe was abrupt and firm but her words knocked Amina right where it hurt. She nodded her head at us. and suddenly, I wanted to help her, and like her, I too wanted to see a drastic and sonic change for the better, but nothing happens overnight. We had to take it step by step. *sigh*\n\nMe: so, why don’t you start at the beginning? Tell us everything.\n\nShe gave a meek smile and sighed. A coughing fit later she began her story. And what can I say, the stuff she told us really made me pop my eyes out every now and again. I knew it was a sick world out there. I knew it. but somehow it was just there, it was never here. I think that is where our problem starts. We allow ourselves to judge other people because it does not come close to us. We do not see it firsthand among our close family and friends and thus when we put ourselves in other peoples shoes, we tend to think “that will never happen to me” or “I would never do that”. I myself am guilty for it. if I never knew Amina on a close level I would have reacted in a very different way. Passing un-approving scowls, fake coughs when she talks, making her feel like she was a hopeless thing who destroyed her life. Yes, Amina is to blame for her actions, she was the one who did the deeds and made her decisions but that didn’t give me a right to laugh at her and judge her. Who knows, she might be forgiven for her ignorance, but do I have a guarantee of forgiveness for my arrogance?\n\nHer story was a rather long one and needless to say a very rough one too. She was really in a mess and it was clear that it would be a long journey back to herself. she was gone completely off the rails. Her parents had no idea of her messed up timeline. They were under the impression that their daughter was safe and sound at her lodging, studying all day and night to be a successful and independent lady. They would be completely ruined if they saw her in this state. Her brother, elder, would totally freak and lose his head if he knew of her addiction. He loathed drugs and all that came with it. she owed a lump sum of money to a drug dealer and was currently hiding from him, if he found her, she would be dead. Literally. and might i add, She is madly and insanely in love with a guy she met recently and was involved in a relationship that was not good for our innocent ears to hear off. they are currently thinking about marriage. however, He, just like the rest of the world, did not know of her addiction. each time she told us of the mess she made, it just got worse and worse.\n\nNaseema’s endless calls to get ourselves back home compelled us to leave her and head back home. Imraan met us in the foyer and we headed home.i couldn’t help but feel a little annoyed. i mean yes, i totally understood that amina was going through a lot right now and that she needed someone to help but did she have to choose this time, now, to bring her messed up drama into my life? maybe i was being selfish by wishing imraan didn’t find her so that i could just concentrate on the one dream i have been waiting for my whole life. but it was really hard to not think of how i was robbed of the attention a bride to be was supposed to get. i didn’t even know if my grandfather told imraan yet.\n\nit didn’t take me long to find out though. From the minute I saw the smirk in imraans eyes, when he met us in the foyer, I knew. I knew that he knew.\n\nMaseeha: (looking at Imraan) what?\n\nImraan: what?\n\nMaseeha: why are you smiling like that?\n\nImraan: I’m not smiling! (smiling)\n\nMaseeha: if you smile any wider, your lips are going to tear. (I snorted and the both looked at me, I stopped and cleared my throat) OH MY GAWD! (giggle) HAH! (pointing at Imraan) you know! Haha! You know!\n\nHis cell went off and he grabbed it and answered.\n\nImraan: (into the mouthpiece) what? (pause) okay we coming mahn. Will you guys chill! (He cut the call and everything was silent)\n\nimraan dropped us at my house and we joined our crew, who piled us with questions the second we walked in, for a yummy breakfast. Maseeha was just too good at making breakfast! good thing i will be living with her soon.\n\nNaseema: so what you are saying is that imraan miraculously found amina drug overdosed and now you’ll are playing doctor for her? Uh am I the only one who remembers what a big fat liar amina is? For all we know this is some scheme!\n\nsabeeha: who are you’ll talking about?\n\nnaseema: (turning to her) crazy second cousin to you two. lived in josi but moved to durban to study at UDW. only allah know why she would leave wits for UDW. (eyes lighting up) hehe maybe she was looking for a rameez! (we all laughed) anyway she was crazy over imraan. loong story but lets just say she got on the wrong side of us motalas!\n\nsabeeha: she sounds creepy.\n\nnaseema: exactly. we don’t need that kind of"
