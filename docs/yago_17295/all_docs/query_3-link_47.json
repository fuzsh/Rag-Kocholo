        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nESRD is a chronic disease which causes a high level of hindrance in different aspects of the patient’s live, leading to poor QOL. Patients with low HRQOL pull out from HD treatment more commonly.14 In domain wise analysis of HD patients, there was highest score in environment domain and lowest in physical domain. Similar pattern was observed by Salim K et al.15 The reason for worst score in physical domain in HD patients is dependence on medical support, strict treatment regime of twice or thrice weekly HD, stat of pain and misery all the times, disturbed sleep and immobility which affect their QOL. These patients have to face many adversities e.g. specific dietary regimen, changes in their body image, dependence on machines which increases anxiety and affect QOL. Other factors are late referral to nephrologist, use of primary access catheter for dialysis and inadequate dialysis which affect QOL according to international literature.\n\nGender affects QOL in general population and HD patients as well.15,16 Females have poor QOL as compared to male patients. In this study, males have better QOL in social relationship domain as compared to females. The reason of better QOL in males is that male have better social relationships (strong relation and sexual activation) and support than females. These patients have more chances of outing and meeting friends which give them encouragement to face challenges of life. Similar observation was made by Santos PR et al.16 and Salim K et al.16Age is one of the important predictor of QOL of HD patients.17 According to Liu WJ et al,18 age more than forty years was a significant risk factor of QOL of HD patients. In this study, Age have negative relationship with physical and psychological health domain. As age increases QOL impairs. But it is different as compared to other study by Khaled Abdel-Kader et al.19 These findings are consistent with the longitudinal HRQOL data in the HD (HEMO) Study, and the North Thames Study findings20 suggest that targeting future interventions at younger patients with CKD may have a larger impact on improving HRQOL. Marital status affects QOL. The major reason for this is that unmarried persons are dependent on their families as compared to married persons who have to run whole family which increases the financial stress and finally affect QOL. In this study as majority of the patients are unemployed 103 (82.4%) so unemployment further increases the mental stress and effect QOL.\n\nThere is positive relationship between the level of school education and the QOL.21 Education level does not affect QOL of HD patients in overall analysis but literate patients have better QOL in Domain 1(Physical health) than Illiterate. The patients who are literate, they have better understanding of the disease and awareness regarding it treatment options. Patients who are satisfied with treatment and they accept it they have better working capacity and sleep and rest which improves their QOL. Eighteen patients were employed among 84(67.2%) literate patients whereas only four patents were employed in 41(32.8%) illiterate patients. This thing shows that with improvement in education, job opportunities are more which improves financial status and improves QOL in HD patients. Similar observation is made by Patti F et al.22 Employment has been found to be a vital factor improving the QOL of ESRD patients. In this study only 22(17.6%) patients are employed. Employment is the only factor which affects the other three domains amongst all four domains of QOL. According to Sathvik BS et al.,23 employment also affect three domains of QOL. Patients who are employed have better QOL in physical & psychological health and social relationship domain than unemployed patients. Similar observation is made by studies in Taiwan24 and Brazil.25 According to Bohlke M et al.25, there were only 11(8%) patients who were employed and having job, amongst them employment was a better predictor of QOL of HD patients. Employed patients can perform their jobs, have better body image, appearance and self esteem which improves their QOL than unemployed.25,26\n\nFinancial status effect QOL of HD patients. According to a report by Nadia Ayub and Zahid Iqbal, income has a positive influence on life satisfaction.26 Patients with better income level have no financial stress in getting a dialysis than in patient with lower income because they have good means of transport in case of medical emergency, better living, noise & pollution free environment and social activities which improve their QOL. Patients with good income support have more chances of availing opportunities for recreation and leisure activities which give them feeling of healthy life and improved QOL. Similar pattern is also observed by Seica A et al.27 According to him, lower socioeconomic status affect QOL in HD patients. Place of residence does not affect QOL in overall analysis but in domain wise analysis patients of rural areas in physical health and environment domain has better QOL as compared to patient living in Urban areas. Although there is improvement in living in urban areas and facilities are more as compared to rural areas but still QOL is better in rural areas. In urban areas, there is burden of traffic on the roads which hinders mobility. In urban areas, life is close to nature, environment is pollution free which improves QOL.\n\nTotal time consumed in getting HD effects QOL significantly in social relationship domain than other domains. Actually patients with good social relations were getting support in the form of private transport which helped them in getting HD timely. Moist LM et al,28 reported similar results. According to him, longer travel time was associated with lower QOL. Government of Pakistan has provided dialysis services at the doorstep of ESRD patients in THQ's and DHQ's hospitals.\n\nMode of transport effect QOL in environment domain than all other domains. Patients with private transport were having better QOL than public and other transports. Private transport provide them freedom for movement, physical safety and less exposure to physical environment like pollution, noise, traffic, climate and clumsy environment. In public transport they have to wait a lot at bus stops and they spent more time in getting HD. Distance covered to reach hospital effect QOL. Patients who were coming from distance more than 5km their QOL was impaired in psychological domain than other domains. Patients who were coming for more distances were having more worries in getting HD and they have to travel a lot in getting HD which increase the time. As already discussed, time consumed in getting HD effect QOL, perhaps underlying factor is distance covered to reach hospital and private transport."
