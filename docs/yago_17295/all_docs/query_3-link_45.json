        "text": "ISLAMABAD: Prominent Pakistani lawyer and rights activist Jibran Nasir was “picked up” by over a dozen unidentified persons in Karachi on Thursday night, his wife and actress Mansha Pasha said.\n\nNasir frequently criticizes Pakistan’s leading political parties, the religious right wing, and the country’s powerful military. He contested the 2013 and 2018 general elections as an independent candidate but managed to secure a few hundred votes each time.\n\nNasir has been increasingly critical of the Pakistani military on social media ever since it announced trying supporters of former prime minister Imran Khan under military laws for attacking its installations and torching government buildings on May 9.\n\n“Approximately half an hour ago, my husband Jibran Nasir who is a very famous lawyer and who has done a lot for Pakistan— I don’t have to say it, you know it already— he has been picked up by some men,” Pasha said in a video message.\n\n“We were on our way home after having dinner when a large white Vigo car intercepted our car, almost crashing into it, and around 15 men with pistols forcibly took my husband away,” she added.\n\n“I would want you all to raise your voices and pray that my husband returns soon.”\n\nKhan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party demanded Nasir’s release, saying that his abduction is against the country’s constitution.\n\n“Law of the jungle must not prevail in Pakistan,” the PTI wrote on Twitter.\n\nFeminist rights movement Aurat March also demanded Nasir’s release, condemning his alleged abduction.\n\n“We strongly condemn his abduction (which is a clear violation of citizen rights) & urge the govt & LEAs to ensure his immediate + unconditional safe release,” it wrote on Twitter.\n\nRights groups have raised alarm over the crackdown against PTI leaders and supporters, which has resulted in several of Khan’s aides leaving the party and distancing themselves from him since May 9.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has denied reports it is illegally abducting dissenters and has repeatedly said only those who partook in violence and vandalism on May 9 would be dealt with according to law.\n\nThe continuing political turmoil has exacerbated Pakistan’s economic crisis with inflation at record highs, with fears of default looming large as the South Asian country so far fails to revive a stalled $6.5 billion loan program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nISLAMABAD: A high-ranking delegation from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday called on Pakistan’s deputy prime minister, Ishaq Dar, and discussed with him investment in Pakistan’s maritime, railways and aviation sectors, Dar’s office said.\n\nThe development comes amid a push for foreign investment by the South Asian country, which has been facing low foreign exchange reserves, currency devaluation and high inflation for the last one year.\n\nSince avoiding a default last year, Pakistan has been making desperate attempts to revive its fragile $350 billion economy and reached a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July for a new $7 billion loan.\n\nThe UAE delegation, which called on the deputy prime minister, was led by Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al-Maktoum, according to Dar’s office.\n\n“The talks focused on investment opportunities in Pakistan’s maritime, railways, and aviation sectors,” it said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe UAE is one of Pakistan’s closest allies and has frequently bailed out the South Asian country, joining Saudi Arabia and China in rolling over billions of dollars of loans in support to the South Asian country.\n\nIn May, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan announced $10 billion investment in Pakistan during a visit by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to the Gulf country, according to Sharif’s Office.\n\nThe South Asian nation this year also signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi (AD) Ports Group, which will be investing about $395 million for the development of a container and cargo terminal under a government-to-government (G2G) agreement between the UAE and Pakistan.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog on Tuesday filed a fresh graft case against former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Khan, for illegally retaining a jewelry set from a state repository, local media reported.\n\nThe case, also called the new Toshakhana reference, came to the fore after the watchdog, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), arrested the couple following their acquittal in an illegal marriage case on July 13.\n\nIt pertains to a jewelry set, comprising a ring, bracelet, necklace a pair of earrings worth over €380,000, gifted to the former first lady by a foreign dignitary that was allegedly undervalued by the couple and retained against a lesser price.\n\nThe NAB reference, which consists of two volumes, was filed by investigation officer Mohsin Haroon and case officer Waqar Hassan in an accountability court, Pakistan’s Geo News channel reported.\n\n“The fresh reference will now be reviewed by the registrar of the accountability courts,” the report read. “After removing the objections, the reference will be sent to the administrative judge.”\n\nOn Monday, an accountability court sent Khan and his wife to jail on a 15-day judicial remand in the new Toshakhana reference, after the couple appeared before the court following the expiry of their 10-day physical remand and submitted a written answer in response to a questionnaire by the accountability watchdog.\n\nThe ex-premier, who has been in jail since last August, was convicted in four cases. Two of the cases have since been suspended and he was acquitted in the remaining two, including the illegal marriage case.\n\nKhan’s convictions had ruled the 71-year-old out of the February general elections as convicted felons cannot run for public office under the Pakistani law. Arguably Pakistan’s most popular politician, Khan says the cases against him are “politically motivated,” aimed at keeping him from returning to power. Pakistani authorities deny this.\n\nThe ex-premier is also facing multiple cases relating to May 9, 2023 protests, which saw his supporters attack government and military installations over his brief arrest in a graft case.\n\nIn a separate development on Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court acquitted Khan’s wife in 12 cases relating to May 9, 2023 violence.\n\nISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered authorities to resolve all issues relating to Meta operations in Pakistan, Sharif’s office said on Tuesday, amid complaints of slow Internet in the South Asian country.\n\nSharif issued the directives at a meeting with a five-member Meta delegation, led by Meta Vice President for Asia Pacific Simon Milner, in Islamabad.\n\nThe development came amid snail-paced Internet speeds in the country in recent weeks, which have particularly affected online businesses and freelancers.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Meta delegation apprised the prime minister of their services in Pakistan and the Asia Pacific region, according to Sharif’s office.\n\n“Both sides expressed their resolve to work together for the development and promotion of digital media and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors in Pakistan,” Sharif’s office said in a statement.\n\nMeta, a California-based American multinational technology conglomerate, owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp among other products and digital services.\n\nThe meeting came days after the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) warned that frequent Internet disruptions and low speeds caused by poor implementation of a nationwide firewall had led many multinational companies to consider relocating their offices out of Pakistan, with some having “already done so.”\n\nPakistan has been installing the firewall to block malicious content, protect government networks from attacks, and allow the government to identify IP addresses associated with what it calls “anti-state propaganda,” according to officials.\n\nSeparately, the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) said last Thursday that Pakistan’s economy could lose up to $300 million due to Internet disruptions caused by the imposition of the firewall.\n\nISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday summoned representatives from the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) and the Ministry of Information Technology on August 26 to respond to senior journalist and television anchor Hamid Mir’s petition regarding the countrywide Internet slowdown amid the installation of a national firewall.\n\nAccording to the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan, nationwide Internet speeds have dropped by 30-40 percent in the last few weeks as the government operationalizes the firewall intended to filter undesired content, such as “anti-state propaganda.”\n\nPakistan’s State Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja rejected reports over the weekend that the government was responsible for slowing or shutting down the Internet in the country, attributing it instead to the widespread use of virtual private networks (VPNs) amid the ban on social media platform X.\n\nMir filed his petition through Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari on Friday, describing the frequent network disruptions in recent weeks as a violation of citizens’ fundamental rights, while challenging the government’s denial of its contribution to the situation.\n\n“During today’s hearing, the chief justice issued notices to PTA and the IT ministry for the next hearing on August 26 and asked why the Internet is slow and what is the firewall,” Mir told Arab News.\n\nHe said the IHC registrar initially raised some objections to his petition, but Chief Justice Aamer Farooq overruled them and scheduled the case for a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nMir noted in his petition he was aggrieved by the government’s conduct, which had caused him and his colleagues significant difficulties in performing their duties as professional journalists, heavily reliant on online connectivity and communication.\n\nHe maintained that young people, particularly students, were also facing substantial challenges.\n\nSpeaking to Arab News, the president of the Pakistan Freelancers Association said last week the businesses of over 2.3 million Pakistani freelance workers had suffered due to the slow Internet.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s hearing, Mir’s lawyer informed the court was fully aware of the Internet disruption affecting the entire country.\n\n“The honorable court inquired about the reasons behind the disruption and sought the government’s stance on the issue,” Mazari said, adding the additional attorney general was unable to provide a satisfactory response, saying he did not use the Internet frequently and was unaware of the situation.\n\nShe added that the chief justice observed the Internet disruption in Pakistan was a matter of common knowledge before summoning representatives from the PTA and IT ministry for the next hearing on August 26.\n\nAsked about the state minister for information technology’s assertion regarding the Internet slowdown, Mazari said it was factually incorrect that it was caused by VPN use.\n\nArab News reached out to the PTA and the Ministry of IT for their comments, but they did not respond by the time this story was filed.\n\nISLAMABAD: Google on Tuesday announced the launch of a special program for Pakistani journalists to help them produce accurate and engaging digital stories, in collaboration with a Pakistani social enterprise, Tech Valley.\n\nThe program, ‘Digital Sahafat,’ or Digital Journalism, is part of the Google News Initiative (GNI) that works with publishers and journalists to fight misinformation, share resources and build a diverse and innovative news ecosystem.\n\n“We’re very excited to announce the launch of Digital Sahafat, a program by the Google News Initiative, in partnership with Tech Valley, to equip 1,000 journalists in Pakistan with the essential tools, training, and resources to produce accurate and engaging digital news stories,” the GNI said in a statement.\n\nThe program will be formally launched in Islamabad on September 4, according to the GNI. The event will be addressed by Kate Beddoe, managing director of Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC) News Partnerships at Google, and the Tech Valley team.\n\nThe GNI has supported journalism worldwide and continues to build on Google’s decades-long dialogue and collaboration in the news industry as part of a global effort to build a more sustainable and equitable news ecosystem. Since 2018, it has partnered with thousands of news organizations in more than a hundred countries to provide tools, programs, and workshops that help publishers worldwide in boosting readership and revenue as they evolve their businesses.\n\nFounded in 2015, Tech Valley aims to bring together public and private sectors of Pakistan by bridging the gap between academia, industry and the government through technology and innovation."
