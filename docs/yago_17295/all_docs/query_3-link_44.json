        "text": "Ibrahim Elgarawany, DDS\n\nDr. Ibrahim Elgarawany, or Dr. G, as he is more commonly known around the office, grew up in a small, rural community in Egypt, where no dental services were available. His neighbors and family members used to suffer from aching teeth all the time. Seeing this prompted him to attend dental school, with the goal of helping local communities, especially in rural areas with limited access to dental care. In 2006, he completed dental school in Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nAfter completing his degree, he finished his post-graduate studies at Saint Mary’s Hospital in Waterbury, CT. He also is affiliated with Yale University. Dr. G has received advanced training in wisdom teeth extraction, Invisalign® aligners, and the placement of mini and regular dental implants. Today, education remains a hallmark of his care. He takes classes once a month to expand his knowledge. Additionally, every three months, he takes a week off of work and attends different continuing education courses to learn about the latest advancements in dentistry.\n\nIn his free time, he enjoys swimming, playing soccer and watching basketball. He also enjoys spending time with his wife and three children.\n\nDr. G enjoys what he does and cares about making a comfortable environment for all of his patients. Our dentist and team can’t wait to help you create a beautiful smile!\n\nDr. Anna Bondalapati\n\nMeet Dr. Anna Bondalapati! Dr. Anna loves seeing happy kids and parents every day. It is her goal to equip every child with the tools they need to maintain good oral hygiene, and to ensure that they enjoy visiting the dentist! She finds great satisfaction in the long-term relationships she can have with patients.\n\nDriven by her passion for pediatrics, Dr. Anna has been working with children since the beginning of her education in dentistry. She focused on pediatric, patient-centered studies, including working with the Infant Oral Health Care Club and the Craniofacial Center. Her dedication to caring for children led her to pursue earning her specialty in pediatric dentistry at Nova Southeastern University, where she served as chief resident. As part of her residency, Dr. Anna excelled in working with children with autism.\n\nDr. Anna strives to make sure children have a safe and positive experience at the dentist’s office. As a loving mother of two herself, she can relate to the feelings that parents have when they’re making decisions about their child’s healthcare. She’s passionate about helping children overcome their fear of the dentist and teaching them how to have the best oral health possible.\n\nSome of the easiest ways to make Dr. Anna smile include, wearing pink or purple, because they are her favorite colors. She also would love to hear who your favorite character in the movie Frozen is. Finally, because she loves seeing the smiles on the faces of her patients, be sure to flash your “pearly white” smile for her.\n\nIn her free time, Dr. Anna is an art lover, and enjoys spending time with her husband and family.\n\nMeet Our Team\n\nPatients who come to Luray Family Dental love working with our dentists and team.
