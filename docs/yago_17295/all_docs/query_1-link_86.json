        "text": "Mohib Ullah, a Rohingya community leader who believed in the power of data to confront the brutality of ethnic cleansing, died on Wednesday, shot by gunmen in a bamboo and tarp shelter in Kutupalong, Bangladesh, the world’s biggest refugee camp. He was 46.\n\nThe gunmen had burst into his shack before opening fire, according to his brother, Habib Ullah, who was with Mr. Mohib Ullah at the time. The shack was stacked high with papers documenting massacres of Rohingya, the Muslim minority native to neighboring Myanmar.\n\nMr. Mohib Ullah, who had worked as an administrator and teacher in Myanmar, quickly emerged as a leader in the sprawling refugee settlements of southeastern Bangladesh, which house about a million displaced Rohingya, many traumatized by their escapes from a campaign of killing, rape and village burning by the Myanmar military.\n\nHis clerklike appearance — crisply parted hair, clean shaven, pens in his shirt pocket — belied a determination that earned him respect in a community that usually venerates clerics and men with gray in their beards. Yet his willingness to speak unpalatable truths also earned him enemies, even within the Rohingya camps. Death threats became part of his life.\n\nMr. Mohib Ullah escaped Myanmar in 2017, when his village, like hundreds of others, was torched by the Myanmar military in a violent campaign that United Nations investigators said bore the hallmarks of genocide. He had barely settled in his tarp shelter before he began trying to document the Myanmar soldiers’ crimes. For years he painstakingly knocked on the doors of refugees, compiling a list of the dead, checking and cross-referencing each life lost. The aim was to provide evidence for international courts to one day prosecute the Myanmar military for genocide and war crimes.\n\nWhen the Rohingya wanted to mark the anniversary of the August 2017 massacres that catalyzed their largest exodus into Bangladesh, Mr. Mohib Ullah tackled the logistics of organizing rallies that took place against the wishes of Bangladeshi security forces. He spoke with gentle force.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
