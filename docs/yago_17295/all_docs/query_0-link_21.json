        "text": "Abbas Ibrahim - the bear with long claws\n\nby DO international editor Michael O'Shea - 29 October 2004\n\nAbbas Ibrahim -\n\n‘propaganda, intimidation and dirty tricks’\n\nAbbas Ibrahim has been a close confidante of the president and enforcer of Gayyoom’s political will since the early 1970s, specialising in propaganda, intimidation and dirty tricks. He was selected this month by President Maumoon Gayyoom as the speaker of the Special constitutional Majlis after a 'show of hands’ election in defiance of the constitutional requirement for a secret vote. Abbas is Gayyoom’s brother-in-law from his wife Nasreena’s powerful Endherimaage household.\n\nAbbas was the son of Abdul Gadir who changed his name to Dhon Maniku and again to Ibrahim Abbas. He was a wealthy trader and advisor to Ameen Didi who ruled from 1944 until 1953 first as Home Minister and then President for less than a year. Half the population of Maldives died of starvation caused by maladministration while Ameen was in charge, according to senior Maldives historian Abdul Hakeem Hussein Manik.\n\nAbbas’s father was a self-made man who received high 'beykalun’ status late in life. As Nasir rose to power, he was working as a trusted servant of Sultan Mohamed Fareed. He served his leaders faithfully and became boss of Maafannu, one of Male’s four wards.\n\nTogether with his brother Ilyas Ibrahim, Abbas inherited control of Maafannu from his father. Abbas was a 'highly political ward leader like his father,’ social anthropologist Dr Elizabeth Overton Colton claims in her 1995 thesis 'The Elite of the Maldives: Sociopolitical organisation and change.’ Colton researched the elite families in Male’ from 1976 until 1983, and detailed the political machinations of the Endherimaage clan and the rise of Maumoon Gayyoom.\n\nAbbas was a news reporter and romance writer for a number of Male’ newspapers in the 1960s, writing under the name of Thulhaadhooge Abbas. According to a well-informed source, Abbas dabbled in cigarette and textile smuggling rackets in the 1960s and 1970s. He acted as household secretary for Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir until 1967 when he was fired for plotting against his master.\n\nAbbas suffered torture ordered by Nasir - he was placed in stocks, handcuffed and incarcerated in a cell next to a bakery in Villingili island west of Male’. Years later, Abbas was scoffing at 'alleged torture’ in Maldives jails when a listener reminded him that he himself had been tortured in jail. 'You have to reach the top of the mountain to know how it is on the other side,’ Abbas replied and then he began quoting from a song he had heard from the Majeediyya School boy scouts. 'The bear went over the mountain, the bear went over the mountain, the bear went over the mountain to see what he could see.’\n\nA bear with long claws would be a suitable metaphor for Abbas’ political persona.\n\nFrom the time Gayyoom returned to Maldives in 1971 after twenty-four years abroad, brother-in-law Abbas was one of his closest confidantes. Abbas was Foreign Minister Fathullah Jameel’s best friend in Male’, according to Gayyoom biographer Royston Ellis. Foreign Minister Fathullah Jameel is a key Gayyoom advisor and his long-term trusted friend. In the 1960s, Abbas Ibrahim asked Fathullah to help his sister Nasreena study English in Egypt. She met Gayyoom in 1965 the day she arrived; they later married. Fathullah, the Endherimaage clan and their associates realised the political value in Maldives of a multi-lingual Islamic scholar like Maumoon Gayyoom, and Gayyoom knew the value of efficient and ruthless family allies.\n\nFathullah Jameel admits to Ellis that Gayyoom was part of their 'gang’, and the future president’s pious public behaviour and reputation as a family man made Fathullah and his other dubious associates more politically acceptable. 'After being known as the rebellious or notorious ones, some people started liking us.'\n\n'He (Gayyoom) was so famous because of his studies in Egypt,’ Abbas Ibrahim told Ellis, 'He enjoyed his first job as a teacher. He has intuition. He wants to teach people, to make sure the person he is with understands.’\n\nAbbas, Gayyoom and Sammarey Manik were arrested in 1973 and temporarily banished for holding political discussions at the Endherimaage house. Gayyoom stayed in the best house on Maamakunudu island for a few months before being recalled to Male’. Abbas learnt herbal medicine and extra fanditha practices on the island where he was exiled.\n\nIn the 1970s, Ilyas was President Nasir’s closest advisor and Abbas remained allied with, and partly protected by his brother; however Abbas’ relationship with President Nasir was marred by plotting and jealousy. Nasir’s third wife Naseema was the sister of a woman Abbas had 'ardently tried to marry’, writes Colton. 'His suit was rejected by the woman’s father (Mohamed Kaleyfaan). He became the father-in-law of the president, which set Abbas even more against Nasir and his affines (kin by marriage).’\n\nThings went better for the 'gang’ in 1978 after an unwell Nasir decided not to contest the presidency. Abbas Ibrahim and his millionaire brother Ilyas were key members of the team that bribed twenty-seven MPs to vote for Gayyoom’s candidature for the referendum. Even after Gayyoom was elected, Abbas and his friends left nothing to chance. Maumoon Gayyoom and his senior supporters all carried pistols when Gayyoom took his first oath as President at midnight on 10 November 1978. Abbas proudly displayed his own pistol to friends. 'We were ready for war that day,’ he later admitted.\n\nAbbas used his new powers as a Gayyoom operative to take 'immediate action against those he felt had wronged him in the past,’ Colton writes. 'He bluntly said to the aging father-in-law (Mohamed Kaleyfaan) of the ex-president, the father of the daughters Abbas had wanted to marry, 'Now that we have the power, we can do anything we want. And I want to have you cut up into little pieces and fed to the crows.“\n\nNasir’s brother-in-law Naseem confessed to a coup plot in 1980, and Gayyoom unleashed a vicious pogrom against a large group of alleged plotters who also happened to be his most experienced and talented political opposition at that time. One of the main families to suffer during this first Gayyoom terror campaign in Male’ was the Hikifinifenmaage household headed by Mohamed Kaleyfaan.\n\n'Thus Abbas and his brother and their friends,’ Colton writes, 'all of whom had grievances against the former President and his affines and their close friends, finally got their revenge.. During the peak of the house arrests in 1980, besides keeping mobs 'howling’ outside their houses, the government installed lights and loudspeakers outside the houses of those accused, and they were kept blaring all night with obscene verbal attacks on the families locked inside the walls around their courtyard and house, terrified that at any moment the mobs might come over the walls.’\n\nAbdullah Hameed, Fathullah Jameel, Maumoon Gayyoom and Abbas Ibrahim on state visit to China 1984\n\nGayyoom frightened Male’ into submission, and Abbas and Ilyas Ibrahim and their NSS allies reigned supreme on the streets of the capital. Abbas travelled with Gayyoom on state visits and began to frequent the UK. He was introduced to Lady Emma Guinness and enlightened her and other guests with the information that his own daughter was also a lady. After he became a minister, Abbas pointed out his new watch to his daughter and explained he had upgraded his timepiece to go with his new special ministerial position.\n\nAbbas’ special duties for Gayyoom included organising the Binbi force in 1989 with Ilyas Ibrahim. The Binbi force was made up of 'middle-aged people who were mainly ex-convicts freed after serving their sentences,’ according to a Libertarian Party of Maldives Internet publication in 2001. It functioned in a similar way to the gang of thugs Gayyoom’s brother Yameen has used against the reform movement throughout 2004.\n\nThe Binbi force was designed by Gayyoom to disrupt reformists in the 1990 Majlis who were led by popular Male’ member Dr Mohamed Waheed. Waheed seemed likely to eventually take the presidency from Gayyoom. The reformists in the Majlis raised questions about financial irregularities in the Fisheries sector and the treatment of prisoners in Maldives jails.\n\nIlyas Ibrahim and his brother Abbas were acting with their own financial and legal interests in mind when they coordinated the Binbi force for Gayyoom. They sabotaged Waheed and other reformers and removed them from their seats by helping frame false charges against them.\n\nThe Binbi force members were immune from prosecution and police interference as they systematically harassed all the important reformers particularly Mohamed Waheed who fled overseas and worked for UNICEF. Dr Waheed visited his family in Male’ this year and announced that he was available as a potential presidential candidate. He would be a popular replacement for the discredited Gayyoom.\n\nIlyas Ibrahim and Abbas challenged Gayyoom for the presidency in the early 1990s. Together, they lost government influence when details of Ilyas’ embezzlement and misappropriation of hundreds of millions of dollars of Fisheries funds were conveniently exposed. Abbas was removed from his minister of state position but later appointed head of the National Council of Linguistics and Historical Research (NCLHR) in Male’ in December 1996.\n\nAbbas had been educated in Male’ to primary education level in Dhivehi medium. As a child he wanted to look intelligent, so he wore a row of empty pen caps in his shirt pocket. Now his pocket held the NCLHR.\n\nHe has shown considerable propaganda skills over the years, for example, making a film about the sixteenth century folk hero Mohamed Thakurufaan which reinforced Gayyoom’s cult image as a defender of Islam, and establishing the magazine 'AAbAAru’ (New Power) which attracted good writers while keeping all political comment subservient and complimentary to the political needs of Gayyoom. His current newspaper Aafathis fulfils the same function.\n\nAs chairman of the National Council of Linguistics and Historical Research since December 1996, Abbas has prevented any meaningful historical and linguistic research in Maldives for eight inglorious years. He has followed dutifully in the footsteps of his ignorant predecessor Gayyoom’s brother Abdullah Hameed.\n\nAlmost all writing of substance has been suppressed and banned in Maldives since 1978. Gayyoom, Abbas and their semi-educated friends have no understanding of history apart from a paranoid fear of its possible political consequences. The NCLHR contains good scholars, but they are forbidden to write meaningful books.\n\nGayyoom has constructed a mythical state history (begun in part by Ameen Didi half a century ago) which can stand no criticism nor polite questioning. Gayyoom’s heroes Thakurufaan, Abdul Majeed, Hassan Fareed and Ameen, like Gayyoom, have a lot to hide. Honest historians are threatened and their work is ignored; if necessary they are tortured or confined to their houses. Abbas is a planner and willing collaborator in this violence and cultural destruction.\n\nLately, Abbas is being promoted as a religious scholar and leader. Considerable media expertise is being put into this public relations exercise, but all Maldivians know that Allah gave up on Abbas a long time ago. His return to political importance as the speaker of the Special constitutional Majlis means that Gayyoom is leaving nothing to chance in this gathering.\n\nThe bear is back.\n\nAbbas and names\n\nAbbas’s patrilineal grandfather was Ibrahim Dhon Maniku, and Abbas’ father hated the name Abdul Gadir and insisted on being known as Dhon Maniku and later (possibly posthumously) as Ibrahim Abbas. For reasons best understood by himself, Abdul Gadir alias Dhon Manikualias Ibrahim Abbas, also kept his grandfather’s first name as the family name for his children, so Abbas Ibrahim was almost Abbas Dhon Maniku and should have been Abbas Abdul Gadir. Later, Abbas had further reason to regret his name when he went to Singapore and found himself nicknamed 'Baas’ in Bahasa Malay. Abbas was offended by 'Baas’ because it sounds close to the Sinhala word 'Baasunna’ or 'work gang foreman’.\n\nThis information may sound trivial, but the Gayyoom regime has heavily regulated all people’s names in Maldives. The sort of 'name anarchy’ practised by Abbas’ father is now forbidden and subject to legal sanctions. No one may change their name in Maldives without government permission and all new babies must have their names submitted to the government for approval. Only Arab or Islamic-sounding names are allowed.\n\nThe 1981 'witchhunts’; list of sentenced people:\n\nNaseem, Nasir’s brother-in-law, was imprisoned for life.\n\nAnother brother-in-law sentenced to 11 years imprisonment.\n\nSaleema, their sister, banished for life.\n\nMohamed Kaleyfaan, their father (then in his 70s) banished for 10 years.\n\nHikifinifenmaage house which contained two other families, a mother, and children, was cordoned off from the rest of Male’.\n\nMana, Naseem’s wife, banished for five and half years.\n\nKandi, the husband of Mana’s sister Moomina, banished for 11 years.\n\nMoomina, banished then pardoned, left Maldives in self-imposed exile.\n\nAbdul Hannan, head of the security forces under President Nasir, banished for life.\n\nMaizan Ali Maniku, former director of Radio Maldives, banished for 10 years.\n\n(A DO correspondent says Maizan was sentenced to life imprisonment, and not banished.)\n\nKuda Sika, Director of Telecommunications under Nasir, banished for 10 years.\n\nKuwa Mohamed Maniku, a businessman and friend of Naseem’s, banished for 5 years.\n\nMohamed Haleem, brother of Hannan and Moomina, banished.\n\nHussein Haleem, only sibling of Nooraanee house not banished, sent to work in the United Nations and placed under surveillance when in Male’.\n\nAhmed Nasir moved to Sweden after being refused new Maldivian passports in Singapore.\n\nNaseema Mohamed moved to Australia.\n\nIbrahim Nasir stayed permanently in Singapore.\n\nNaseema Mohamed moved to Australia.\n\nIbrahim Nasir stayed permanently in Singapore.\n\nSentencing list above, and graphic below, are from Dr Elizabeth Colton’s 1995 thesis:\n\n'The Elite of the Maldives: Sociopolitical organisation and change.\n\nThe Maldives Islanders - a study of the popular culture of an ancient ocean kingdom\n\nby Xavier Romero Frias - Published by Nova Ethnographia Indica, Barcelona, Spain - Reviewed by Michael O'Shea and Majid Abdul-Wahhab\n\nFor the last 20 years, the Maldivian islands in the central Indian Ocean have been very successfully marketed as an exclusive tropical tourist destination. However, English language books examining the detailed history and culture of this independent atoll nation are few and only occasionally available, even in university libraries.\n\nUntil the publication of this learned new book by Xavier Romero-Frias, the most incisive examination of Maldivian culture was a 400 year old account of a forced stay in the capital island Malé, written by shipwrecked Frenchman Pyrard de Laval. Pyrard’s experiences were fascinating, but limited almost solely to Malé-based encounters; mainly with the King’s court and the traders who serviced it.\n\nOnly two major books about the Maldives have appeared in English in the last hundred years. The result of a twenty year partnership between Sri Lankan-based British archaeologist H.C.P. Bell and his Sri Lankan assistant W. L. de Silva, The Maldive Islands, published in 1940, ran the gauntlet of war-time and then cold war censorship as Addu atoll at the southern tip of Maldives became a strategic part of Great Britain’s air and naval presence in the Indian Ocean. The book became an expensive collector’s item, until a facsimile copy was quietly published in Maldives in the mid-1980s.\n\nEminent South Asian scholar and anthropologist Clarence Maloney wrote People of the Maldive Islands during the late 1970s. His work was much more independent and objective than Bell and de Silva’s, especially in its judgment of the Maldivian psyche. Later research has validated many of Maloney’s clever speculations surrounding Maldives’ historical origins, but his cultural understanding seems to have been hampered by lack of cooperation from the Maldivian intellectual elite.\n\nRomero-Frias’ The Maldive Islanders completely redefines the basis of scholarship about the Maldives. He spent 12 years in the Maldives achieving complete fluency in Dhivehi, the Maldivian language. He has immersed himself in Dhivehi culture, and unlike previous foreign scholars, his studies are firmly based in the oral traditions of the atolls.\n\nHe examines the ancient stories of Maldives, and argues convincingly that their foreign inspiration is drawn largely from the Indian sub-continent. For western readers familiar with the islands’ geographical location (southwest of India), this revelation is hardly surprising, but many Maldivians will find the book deeply confronting.\n\nThe reasons for this unease may be difficult for a foreigner to grasp. The small Maldivian intelligentsia has often imitated the cultural traditions of Arabia. Their views were most strongly represented among Maldivian judges and magistrates; particularly in the capital island Malé. But the Maldivian royal court and island people usually defined these Islamic traditions in their own idiosyncratic way, preferring to blend them with uniquely Maldivian customs and beliefs.\n\nHowever for the last 20 years Maldivians have undergone intense cultural brainwashing under the guidance of the all-powerful President Maumoon Gayyoom regime and its view that Maldivian culture should be portrayed as a form of Islam. His nepotistic administration, which built on the modernising foundations laid by the former ruler Ibrahim Nasir, has delivered real economic progress to previously impoverished Maldivians, and the worth of many Malé families is now measured in millions of dollars. This wealth is concentrated almost exclusively in Malé, and the capital has become one of the most crowded places on earth. But the intense centralisation, and the associated neglect of other islands, has many negative effects on family life as people move to the capital for work and education.\n\nGayyoom has turned himself into a cult figure, a type of Maldivian island god, from whom all benefits (and fears) flow. Malé’s National Council of Linguistics and Historical Research rewards only those who kow-tow to the President, and actively suppresses any independent thought. As Romero-Frias explains: ‘The imposition of the Islamic way of life has been acute since 1978, when a government hostile to Dhivehi lifestyle and traditions (which it sees as a deviation from Islam), came to power. Its policies have been successful owing to the non-existence of institutions that could effectively protect the local traditional heritage. This lack makes Maldivian people extremely vulnerable to the predatory whims of their leaders.’ It should also be understood that there is a fear among Muslim Maldivians that resisting Arabisation and refusing to condemn independent Dhivehi culture is blasphemous against Allah.\n\nIn his book Romero-Frias provides many English translations of Maldivian stories and then examines them in the light of his research at universities in India, Sri Lanka and Europe. His arguments are firmly based on the texts, and the findings are closely argued and compelling.\n\nThe first section, 'An Oceanic Civilization’, begins by explaining the lifestyles and perspectives of ordinary Maldive islanders. Here the reader becomes aware of Romero-Frias’ extraordinary understanding and empathy for the common people. Maldivian scholarship has been (and usually still is) restricted to the concerns and perspectives of the ruling elite in Malé and their foreign associates.\n\nThe author examines the early history myths and cycles of Islamic conversion, and then moves on to the Maldivian romance and adventure epic Dhon Hiyala and Ali Fulhu, a text used to teach Dhivehi to the country’s school students. In part, the story functions as an instruction manual for Islamic life and death rituals. But Romero-Frias shows the tale’s structure also has a close affinity with India’s classic Hindu drama, The Ramayana. This first chapter ends with a sobering account of the effect of an epidemic on the equatorial island of Fua Mulaku.\n\nThe second section, 'The Island Mother’, is an examination of the role of women and female island gods in Dhivehi culture. Romero-Frias explains the links between beliefs in female spirits and the ancient Dhivehi goddesses of the sea and islands. Their original derivation from southern and northern India, and relationship to the traditional matriarchal Dhivehi social system is also discussed. In this chapter the author begins his explanation of the complex role of the awesome male sorcerers, known locally as fanditha men, whose social status oscillates between that of hero and despised evil magician. These dual roles are still apparent. For example a fanditha man was exiled for casting spells to influence the 2001 football finals in Malé.\n\nIt is in the third section, 'At the Threshold of the Spirit World’, that Romero-Frias takes the reader into the tantric component of the superstitions that permeate Maldivian society. He agrees with other South Asian scholars that tantric Buddhism was comfortable with the ancient Dravidian beliefs of Maldivians, and hence, in the first millennium it was this form of Buddhism that found acceptance in the islands. Later in the book, the author reveals how the words for tantric philosophical concepts still remain in Dhivehi astrology, though their original meanings are completely forgotten.\n\nIn the final chapter, 'A Showdown of Doctrines’, the author fearlessly tackles the question of Islamisation of Dhivehi culture. Romero-Frias has no sympathy with attempts to rewrite the atolls’ cultural history to satisfy what the present Maldivian government perceives as acceptable. The author argues that origins of this censorship are in the superstitious belief that Arab visitors to Maldives had a mystical power due to their knowledge of Arabic, the Quran, and claims of their close kinship to the holy prophet, Muhammad. Here, Romero-Frias sometimes leaves the oral traditions and illustrates his argument using Maldivian historical documents.\n\nThis book cannot be recommended too highly. For Maldivians who want to understand the history of their culture, for foreigners who are curious about this enigmatic atoll nation, and for scholars of South Asia, The Maldive Islanders by Romero-Frias is the best book ever published about Maldives in the English language.\n\nReviewers\n\nMichael O'Shea has a BA and Master of Letters in History, and is an editor of Maldives Culture, an internet site devoted to Maldivian cultural and political affairs: www.maldivesculture.com\n\nMajid Abdul-Wahhab has a BA and Diploma of Education.
