        "text": "The complex character of the effects of climate change on human communities requires extensive nterdisciplinary research, including more recognition of its social and cultural aspects. This study provides an example of this kind of research, using the example of a small island country in the Indian Ocean, Maldives. Because of its exceptional physical vulnerability to sea-level rise as a consequence of global warming, as well as its unique coral landscape, which will soon be lost, Maldives is known to the international audience as a ‘sinking paradise’. This study explores the attitudes towards the threat of sea-level rise that have been adopted by the country’s inhabitants and the cultural patterns that influence them. An in-depth case study, based on qualitative interviews, participant observation, and analysis of previously existing resources during nearly six months of fieldwork, revealed denial and disinterest on the part of Maldivians in regard to the upcoming natural disaster predicted by climatologists for their homeland. This would seem to be controversial, if one compares the reaction of Maldivians with that of certain other communities living in areas especially exposed to dangers connected with climate change. The cultural theory of risk developed by Mary Douglas and Aaron Wildavsky proved constructive in explaining this state of affairs. The theory assumes that awareness of all potential dangers is beyond human capacity; thus societies select and rank those risks which appear most important, while ignoring others. Prioritising dangers serves as a social strategy to enable day-to-day functioning. From the perspective of the Maldivians, the main issue is the introduction of democracy in recent years, which has triggered internal conflicts as well as the rise of violence, gang activity and drug use among the younger generation. Sea-level rise, on the other hand, is not considered a real danger by Maldivians. They regard it as doubtful, and even if it is a real danger, they trust in God’s will concerning their future. In addition, citizens of Maldives have always been aware of and accustomed to the changeable nature of their islands, and are also used to internal migration. A modified version of the grid-group model proposed by Mary Douglas enables the identification of the underlying rules of Maldivian society, in turn making it possible to understand why the ranking of the risks takes the form it does. According to my research findings, one of the main factors regulating cultural patterns in Maldives is reluctance to accept change ‒ change which has appeared inevitable since Maldives began to participate in world affairs following the introduction of tourism in the 1970s. To summarise, the example of Maldives proves the importance of examining various cultural environments in areas especially exposed to the negative effects of climate change. This approach not only promotes the development of a new trend in the study of the relationship between culture and nature, but suggests the application of risk management policies according to the specific cultural context of the threatened area in question."
