Like her father, Mariyam Saeed was a celebrated writer and poet and was conferred the National Award of Honour in the field of Dhivehi poetry in 1983.\n\nNasheed, the first democratically elected Maldives president, said that she had brought new hope for Maldivian poetry and women, and said that Mariyam, who came from a family of poets, wrote poetry filled with 'meaning and emotion'.\n\nFurthermore, noting that Mariyam Saeed and President Nasirâ€™s two children Ali Nasir and Mohamed Nasir were 'killed due to business rivalries during a time of political turmoil', Nasheed said that that Maryam Saeed shown 'patience and calm in her entire life'."
