        "text": "Ibrahim Nasir, 82, who led the Maldives' independence movement from the British and became the island nation's first president, died Saturday.\n\nMr. Nasir died at a Singapore hospital, and his body was flown back to the Maldives, Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaeed said Sunday. The cause of death was not known, he said.\n\nMr. Nasir became the prime minister of the British protectorate in 1957 at age 31. He signed an agreement with the British that won independence for the Indian Ocean islands in 1965.\n\nIn 1968, three years after independence, Mr. Nasir became the Maldives' first president and held that position until he resigned 10 years later. He was accused of ruling the country as a dictator and fled in 1978 amid public resentment and unproven allegations of corruption in handling public funds."
