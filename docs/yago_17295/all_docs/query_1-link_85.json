        "text": "EVERY BIT COUNTS: Naseema Shukoor poses with her work of art at her residence in Doha.\n\nBy Anand Holla\n\nAround two years ago, self-taught artist Naseema Shukoor chose a most beloved\n\nvisual for her next work of art – Makkah at night. After putting together approximately 600,000 tiny bits obtained from punching coloured paper with a hole puncher, Naseema’s most ambitious project comprising endless hours has now come to fruition in full-scale grandeur.\n\n“I have been working at it day in, day out for two years,” Naseema told Community, about her latest and proudest work measuring 3m by 4m, sprawled across the wall of her living room, “Makkah is our favourite place. I wanted to do this work because it came from my heart. I believed in the idea, even though I didn’t know how it would finally look. I feel content.”\n\nThe look, scale and detailing of Naseema’s ingenious work of art is certainly impressive. While this piece is perhaps her most challenging feat, such an arduous experiment with creativity isn’t new to this Indian expat from Kerala.\n\nFor years, the walls of the Shukoors’ Doha residence have been filled with all sorts of art works made by Naseema – bead-work, paper quilling, embroidery, collage, wax work and pixel art; to name a few. “My foray into arts and crafts began with making artificial flowers, around 15 years back,” she says, “Ever since, I have tried everything from socks to coffee powder to make art.”\n\nHer husband Abdul Shukoor, who has been living in Qatar for 35 years – Naseema and their two children, Mohamed Asif and Mohamed Hafis, too, have been here for more than two decades – feels she has always had the talent to spin fantastic pieces of art and craft from whatever materials she fancies upon. “When our children began going to school, she began working on these things,” he says.\n\nPreviously, Naseema had created a large bead-work replica of a beautiful oil painting by Raja Ravi Varma titled The Maharashtrian Lady, which features an Indian lady clad in traditional attire and ornaments, holding a plate of fruits. That piece needed 150,000 beads and six months to complete.\n\n“Soon after finishing that, I thought of making this,” says Naseema, “We have performed Umrah thrice and have gone to Haj twice. It felt special to take up this idea. While I initially thought of putting the Makkah picture together using beads, it wasn’t feasible because it will require way too many beads.”\n\n“Then, I thought of making it using tiny square bits of paper but since no hole puncher yields square paper bits, I decided to use the round paper bits that we get using the hole puncher,” she says.\n\nBut how did she arrive at the number of paper bits required – 600,000?\n\n“After choosing a picture of Makkah on the computer, I enlarged it, studied it, and visually segregated it into five vertical strips,” Naseema explains, “I stuck 25 sheets of black chart paper on a canvas for the background and then pasted these individual coloured paper bits on consecutive strips, after figuring which portion of the image needs which colour, so that eventually they would all appear like one, cohesive image.”\n\nThe papers chosen for being hole-punched were coloured – red, yellow, blue, and green – or just white, which she often sourced from the glossy pages of newspapers and magazines. “At a time, I can punch a maximum of 30 paper bits,” Naseema says, “Then each bit has to be diligently pasted in the exact place to get the desired cumulative effect of the visual.”\n\nAlmost every day, Naseema, over these past two years, has spent an hour or two working on her pet project. “It’s a meticulous task because one bit can be green and the adjacent one yellow. It needs a lot of patience,” she says.\n\nWhile pixel art is popular, nobody has really explored art using paper bits left behind by a hole puncher, feels Naseema. The effect is interesting as it usually is with such mediums of art. If you look at the piece up close, things aren’t that clear. Step five feet away from it and the magic of the image draws you in.\n\nUnderstandably, a lot of people have approached Naseema for classes. “If I get a bigger space to teach, perhaps I will,” she says, “But I also can’t fully explain the techniques because all that I do are my own ideas and execution.”\n\nAs much as the couple love this spectacular work of art gracing their home, Abdul Shukoor feels it’s meant for bigger places. “If someone wants to display it in a museum or at an airport, we would happily agree,” he says.\n\nNaseema Shukoor can be contacted at [email protected]"
