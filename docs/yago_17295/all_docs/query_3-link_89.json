        "text": "Part 3 of 3\n\nThe Maldivian leadership began to believe that independence was destiny. Britain put unprecedented restrictions on the concepts of “sovereignty” and “independence”, which the Maldives, nonetheless, accepted and signed the Independence Agreement on 26 July 1965\n\nIndependence is Destiny\n\nBritish Prime Minister Macmillan was facing renewed urgency to counter Soviet propaganda. Policy planners in London were proposing to set up a BBC relay station in Addu that would reach listeners in India. Macmillan dispatched the Commonwealth Relations Secretary, Duncan Sandys, to Malé in September 1963. Sandys—whose visit was reported in British media[1] as a “fishing holiday”—would remain the highest-level British official to visit the Maldives until Queen Elizabeth’s royal visit, nine years later, in 1972. The purpose of the visit was to request Nasir for additional land in Hithadhoo and to extend the lease period of Gan.\n\nNasir agreed. Interestingly, the Prime Minister did not make his agreement conditional to Maldives being granted full independence. He, nonetheless, emphasised that full external independence was an absolute necessity.\n\nNasir, of course, had a competing priority. He was the only Maldivian leader to ever face the task of reclaiming lost territory from secessionist rebels. That burden may have been quite heavy to carry. Nasir was willing, then, to do whatever it took to secure British support and intervention to reclaim Addu. Sandys readily agreed, and even issued a joint communiqué, in Malé, on September 9, committing Britain’s support to end the rebellion.\n\nOn the question of independence, Sandys assured Nasir that the request would receive sympathetic hearing in London so long as the Maldives agrees not to allow a third country to develop a military base in any part of the country.[2]\n\nBritain and the United States were seriously worried about Soviet Union’s potential influence in the Maldives. The analysts in Western capitals noted around this time that the Soviets are showing “much too much interest in the Maldives”. They also believed that the “agitation against Britain” in the Maldives to “third” countries, including Soviet Union, China, Egypt, and Indonesia, all of whom may be “aiding and abetting the Maldivian government”.\n\nSince Nasir agreed to the conditions set out by Sandys, the discussions effectively set the framework—and even the actual formulation of key articles—for the independence agreement signed in 1965. Sandys travelled to Addu and persuaded the rebel leader Afif and others to give up their claim for a separate state.\n\nThe goodwill created during Sandys visit was short lived, however. Three weeks after the visit, Britain evacuated Afif, his wife, and children, on a naval ship on September 27, 1963, and settled them in Seychelles, then a British colony.\n\nThis, understandably, angered the Maldives government.\n\nThe Maldives accused Britain of violating all bilateral agreements. Public frustration was palpable, with residents of Malé fully mobilized in support of the Prime Minister’s stand on Addu. Government officials refused to meet the British envoy in Malé, Arthington-Davy, making it difficult for him to relay messages from London. The situation escalated to the point where, on October 2, the government announced[3] it would communicate with Arthington-Davy only in Dhivehi, a language neither he, nor his staff, understood.\n\nBritain, in an assessment carried out in early 1963, concluded that Afif’s “education, personality and political acumen were not matched by any other Adduan, and if he were to be removed, there would be no-one capable of taking over the presidency” of the separatist entity.[4] Despite the government’s public anger, therefore, the leadership would have been—at least secretly—feeling happy about Afif’s departure. For that event marked the end of the rebellion in the south. Leading figures in Addu and Fuah Mulah started arriving in Malé, pledging their allegiance to the central government. The government re-stablished its office in Addu atoll in January 1964, and regained full control of Addu for the first time since January 1959.\n\nIn the meantime, military planners in London were busy; frantically trying to find a formula to secure the future of Gan as a military base. They considered granting the Maldives full external independence as an incentive for non-interference in Gan, or even a more radical approach—separating Gan from Maldivian jurisdiction altogether as a British overseas territory.[5] The British planners pondered with these two options on the belief that the political turmoil in the Maldives, especially in Addu, will continue to pose serious risks to the operation of Gan.\n\nUltimately, they decided that separating Gan was too risky and would attract international criticism. In a joint memorandum to the British cabinet on April 23, 1964, the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and Ministry of Defence expressed the view that Britain was facing the risk of not being able to retain Gan for too long.[6]\n\nNegotiations towards full external independence of the Maldives began with a letter from the British envoy in Malé, Arthington-Davy, to Prime Minister Nasir, in May 1964. Britain was prepared to accept Maldives request for independence.\n\nBut serious conditions applied.\n\nThe Maldives should agree that it will not allow any third-country to have any kind of military facility in the country, or even allow a military vessel or aircraft entering the Maldives without prior approval of Britain. Nasir agreed.\n\nNegotiations between the two sides commenced in Colombo in May 1964. It was the first time since 1956 that the discussion between the two sides had the mutually agreed objective of granting external independence to the Maldives. Talks were held between the Maldivian government representative, Abdul Sattar (who had been a regular member of the Maldives negotiation team since 1958) and the British ambassador, Michael Walker.\n\nNasir had a few demands to make:[7] the wages of Maldivians working in Gan be paid in rufiyaa, instead of the sterling pound; Britain to transfer the full amount of wages in sterling to the Maldives government, and the latter would pay the workers, in rufiyaa, at an exchange rate determined by the government; the RAF in Gan to prevent Adduans from trading with the ships that visit Gan with the regular supplies to the British military; and the RAF leadership to help the government in collecting taxes levied since January 1959. Britain rejected all.\n\nThe Maldivian side eventually dropped its demands, agreeing, in June 1965, to Britain’s earlier proposed text for the independence agreement. The Maldives put aside all unresolved issues for discussion at a later date. The text sought to Britain unrestricted rights to the airbase in Gan. It did not allow the Maldives, the right to permit “the entry into or use of the territory, territorial waters or air space” by the armed forces of any other country. It also did not allow the Maldives to give “rights and facilities of a military character” in any part of the Maldives to a third country. Nasir agreed to all these limitations.\n\nBy then, Prime Minister Nasir was in Colombo. He had travelled there in the government ship, Maldive Star, in June 1965, with King Mohamed Fareed, who needed medical treatment in Ceylon.\n\nNasir stayed at Fehige, the Maldivian government representative’s office-cum-residence. He informed King Fareed that the independence agreement was going to be signed, a couple of days before the July 26 signing ceremony. By that time, Walker had received clearance from the British Foreign Office to sign the agreement.[8] He also had received from London, the Letter of Credence, appointing him as the first British ambassador to the Maldives (resident in Colombo), which he presented to the Maldivian Prime Minister, immediately after signing the independence agreement.\n\nIt so happened that the first foreign diplomatic envoy accredited to the Maldives presented the credentials not to the King, but to the Prime Minister. (The King was receiving medical treatment at a hospital in Colombo on that day.)\n\nThe Maldivian side accepted this breach of normal diplomatic protocol. For it guaranteed the emergence of the Maldives as a fully sovereign, independent state, ready to engage diplomatically or otherwise with any other country in the world.\n\nThe signing ceremony of the independence agreement was notable for being low-key. There were no invitees—other than those who took part in the negotiations—to witness the signing. In fact, Abdul Sattar made a specific request to the British ambassador not to invite other dignitaries to the event. Nasir did not like pompous ceremonies. The Maldivian side also declined the ambassador’s suggestion for lunch after the ceremony. The most that the British envoy could do was organise a modest tea for his guests. Nasir joined this diplomatic tête-à-tête with “much humour”, but only briefly, and then left with his small entourage for Fehige.\n\nImmediately after arriving at Fehige, Nasir would give instructions to Sattar about the very first foreign policy decision that the independent Maldives would take. That decision would surprise many.\n\nEND\n\n[1] The Times (London), “R.A.F.
