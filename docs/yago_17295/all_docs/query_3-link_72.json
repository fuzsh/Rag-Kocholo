        "text": "5-16-2012\n\nEpisode 21: The Prophet Marries Khadijah\n\nWelcome to Seerah Pearls, which aims to highlight some tantalising learning points from each episode of the Seerah- Life of the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam).\n\nFurther details about the marriage between Khadija (radi Allahu anha) and the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) are explored. The brother and uncle of Khadija (radi Allahu anha) oversaw the marriage process between them. Others say her father was involved. Khadija (radi Allahu anha) sent the official marriage proposal and called the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) to meet the family. The Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) goes to his uncles and asks about the proposal. They all agree and Hamza, his uncle and milk brother, acts as his representative. They attend the house of Khadija (radi Allahu anha) and the nikkah is performed. It is said that Khadija (radi Allahu anha) was aged 40 and the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) 25. However, some scholars report she was less than this, with opinions ranging from 28 to mid-30s.\n\nKhadija (radi Allahu anha) addressed the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) when he came for the proposal. She explains the reasons why she would like to marry him, which are primarily based on his good character e.g. she mentions he maintained relationships, was the best of his people and honest in speech. Similarly, the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) spoke about Khadija (radi Allahu anha), praising her position as an honourable lady of Quraysh and her dignified character.\n\nThe mahr (marriage gift) was 20 goats. Some say it was 20 camels. By the standards of that time, it is a respectable mahr, but not extravagant. The Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) did not come from an extremely wealthy family, but he was still the grandson of Abdul Muttalib. The mahr should be an expression of love, so it should be given in accordance with a person’s means.\n\nThe Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) was married to Khadija (radi Allahu anha) for 25 years before her passing. He did not marry any other during their marriage, even though polygamy was common practice at that time. Together, they had 6 children: 2 sons and 4 daughters."
