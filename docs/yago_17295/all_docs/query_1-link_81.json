        "text": "Life after professional sport: cruel, crisis or magnificient The life what was built for years, what contained diligence, soul finishes one day. You have lots of way, possibility for future: become trainer - coach; settle down and family time - become parent, psychiatrist, change of roles in family, pay of family, economical loss - financial problems, real fame, role in a film – commercial advertisement, become mentor with the knowledge, help for parents whose children do professional sports, lead of association, become ambassador of the sport, become sponsor. After way to world competition way to chosen aim, values. #gecsebrigitta\n\nFortunate to have participated again (on its second year) in the ROG Assembly's Mentoring Sessions, specifically on the break-out groups: The Influencer: Exerting Influence on LCEs with DTI Region 11 RD Belle Ambi and DTI Region 12 RD Flora Gabunales, The Collab: Fostering Collaboration from Within and Cross-Functional Teams with DTI Region 5 RD Dindo Nabol and DTI Region 1 RD Grace Baluyan, and The Lens: Converging the Best Breed of MSMEs with DTI Region 10 RD Ermie Abang and DTI Region 9 RD Al Lipae . Missed the topic on The Hand: Managing Challenges on Consumer Protection with Asec. Leny Baluyot. All these directed towards further developing DTI Regional Operations agility and responsiveness in line with the agency's strategic direction 2023-2028 on people and organization.\n\nThe youth wants to take responsibility but where do we provide that The companies want young people to have skills but they lack the skills the organisations need What are the skills the organisations mostly wants young people to have How can we give the freedom to young people to take responsibility I spoke to Mr. Pradeep Ghosh of Oasis) And he shared some interesting insights into skills development #skilldevelopment #youthempowerment\n\nA few weeks ago I was privileged to attend the launch of AIEGS NIGERIA and here are a few things I learned just from observing the team chemistry: 1. Invest in your staffs: This way the least member of your staff is able to represent you well. I was impressed by how every staff member was exceptional at their job. 2. Celebrate and reward your employees: I was truly touched when the CEO’s and brand mangers publicly acknowledged the work their employees put into the launch. It was an event that hosted dignitaries and many influential individuals and most organizations would not want to talk about the brains behind their company in fear that their employees would be poached. AIEGS must be secure in how well they treat their employees because they celebrated their employees without holding back. 3. Sell your business value to the front runner of your business: Hats off to the Brand specialist for being so in tune with the goals and mission of the company, it really sold the brand to everyone present. That said, I would advise that you go into a company who looks after your best interest and when you get there put in your best, sharpen what your best is and make it even better."
