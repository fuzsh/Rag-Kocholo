        "text": "I am excited to announce that I kicked off National Social Work month by passing my Association of Social Work Licensing Boards Exam! If you know me well, you understand why this is so important-for those who don‚Äôt, allow me to share. As a twice exceptional (2E) learner I have always struggled deeply with testing. Memorization and regurgitation of information have always been difficult for me. Additionally, in test scenarios my mind often goes blank. This meant that I STRUGGLED academically (I‚Äôm talking mostly c‚Äôs and d‚Äôs) because the educational environments I was in during my k-12 years used testing as the highest factor in grading. Even though I participated in class and was able to demonstrate understanding in conversation and projects, my inability to test well meant that my transcript reflected a lack of understanding and effort. I did horribly on the SAT and ACT exams, getting into one college with a 90 something percent acceptance rate. While this turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me (shout out Evergreen!) it impacted my self esteem greatly. I purposefully avoided applying to any graduate schools that required candidates to take the GRE and was shocked when I was accepted to both schools that were not only my top choices, but at elite institutions that would never have considered my application or value at the undergraduate level. Board exams are notoriously difficult AND many of my friends and colleagues did minimal prep for theirs, taking a prep course, studying for a month or 2. I knew that wasn‚Äôt an option for me. I spent 6 months studying, I paid for and completed 2 different online prep courses, downloaded 3 apps where I completed between 40-200 questions a day, I took 7 practice exams‚Ä¶and still when the time came I was terrified. I know I‚Äôm a great therapist, I know that a standardized test does not reflect a clinicians ability to do effective and meaningful work, I know that test are really difficult for me and I knew that passing this exam was mandatory to continue my career. I had zero idea if I passed when I clicked submit. If I hadn‚Äôt passed, I knew I would find peace in knowing in did everything I could to see myself up for success. I am celebrating this win loudly and proudly because I worked really hard for it.Seeing states like Illinois developing alternatives for social workers to demonstrate their capacity gives me hope other states will follow in their quest for accessibility and inclusion in our field. A test score doesn‚Äôt determine your worth. Your effort, your willingness to acknowledge what you need to succeed and giving yourself permission to access those resources is what matters!#socialworkmonth #2e #inclusionforall\n\nSocial Mobility Day exists to promote wider conversations about social mobility and to encourage action that brings about positive change. This year‚Äôs theme is #sharemoments. I am from West Belfast&grew up during the troubles. One of my first memories is being evacuated from a cinema because of a bomb ‚Äì but that is a story for another day... I come from an area of Belfast where there are high rates of unemployment &social deprivation.I lived on a council estate. Had it not been for the love &support of my parents&their constant encouragement then I probably would have never have pursued a career in law. I studied Law at Queen‚Äôs University in Belfast. To say I was completely overwhelmed when I started University is an understatement. I had huge imposer syndrome. I lived at home with my parents rather than in a student house because of financial reasons and so I do not feel that I integrated properly. Then the catalyst - One of my favourite parts of being at Queen‚Äôs University was my lecturer, Phil Scraton, a criminologist, academic &author. He is a social researcher, known particularly for his work into the context, circumstances and aftermath of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. He was born in Wallasey and moved to Liverpool. He is a proud working-class man and a huge advocate for social change. I recall when I attended his lecturers the feeling of - finally seeing someone \"just like me\" who I could relate to and aspire to be like; someone from similar working-class background to myself (and proud of it ) who had made something of himself. Phil Scraton is a strong advocate of increasing access to education, especially for people from ‚Äúnon-traditional‚Äù backgrounds. He has said - ‚ÄúNo-one in my family went to university, it wasn‚Äôt on their radar. After I left the seminary, where any desire I had for learning had been dimmed, I was supported by further education tutors who instilled self-belief.‚Äù I knew no lawyers, no one in my family had read or practised law. The importance of role models and mentors cannot be overstated. By just seeing & listening (in awe) to someone from a background similar to me who was encouraging &supportive whilst proud of his modest roots was just what I needed. As mentees grow and progress in their careers, they become mentors themselves, perpetuating the cycle of #socialmobility and empowerment. I am so proud to work at Clarke Willmott with so many people who are proud of their diverse backgrounds. I am proud of a firm that does so much in relation to #socialmobility. We champion employment opportunities for all &are committed to levelling the playing field for those preparing for the world of work. We are joined on our journey by our national partner The Social Mobility Foundation So whilst I share my story, I don‚Äôt share a pic of me but a pic of the person who (probably without knowing it) was my mentor and was one of the people who helped me achieve all that I have. #sharethemoments #stateschoolproud\n\nSometimes I feel a bit out of touch with youth. This is a regular feeling as a father of a soon to be 16 year old son. With that said- there's no better way to become more in touch than to simply sit and really listen to others reflect on their experiences. I had the pleasure of recently speaking at The Wily Network graduation dinner. I've always been a fan of Wily's mission and Executive Director Judi Alperin King, Ph.D. However, being at a dinner table celebrating their graduating scholars took my support to a whole new level. At the end of the dinner, graduates had the opportunity to share some of their thoughts and feelings. At first, the room was a bit quiet. But then story after story began to be told. Stories that included isolation being replaced by a sense of community and belonging. Hopelessness turning into hopefulness. Sadness not fully resolved but complemented with much more joy. All because a community wrapped themselves around young people who needed support. I heard over and over again the sentiments, \"I felt seen and valued\", \"they met me where I was at and supported me on my own terms,\" and \"I'm not sure I'd have graduated without them\". I also heard a very realistic view of the future. \"I know the road ahead is going to be challenging at times but I also know that I have my Wily community to support me.\" All it takes is one person that makes you feel seen and valued to change the trajectory of your life. I can fully testify to this. I was fortunate enough to have several adults mentor, guide, and stand by me during a time when I was holding on just to survive. I tried to not give too much advice during my speech but here were just a few messages I wanted to convey. Who knows- perhaps they may serve a good purpose in the future. ‚óè You will likely feel like an imposter sometimes. Don‚Äôt let anyone diminish who you are and what you have to offer. And when you feel like that's happening, surround yourself with people who remind you of your value; ‚óè Be very proud of what you‚Äôve accomplished up to this point and know that you're SO much more than what you accomplish academically and professionally; ‚óè Being unaccountable is a double edge sword. You may not have to ‚Äúreport\" to anyone or have their pressures placed on your shoulders. However, you also won‚Äôt have their guidance and mentorship. There's nothing wrong with wanting someone to be proud of you and we all need people in our lives that push us to reach our fullest potential. ‚óè Be an unapologetic justice seeker! We need a lot more justice in this world, not to mention compassion. Thank you to Wily and the graduating scholars for reminding me that we're never really out of touch if we truly show up for one another.\n\nI had the honor of learning from Afrika Afeni Mills in a 6-hour session entitled Opening Windows and Minds: Transforming Ourselves, Transforming Society. First of all, for the last month, I have listened to her audiobook \"Open Windows, Open Minds‚Äù. The book is rich with resources and strategies. This is an excellent book for if you are interested in developing anti-racist, pro-human students and adults. The book was so good that I ordered a copy and had it delivered to my hotel. But here are my takeaways from the session: üåü You have to explore your privileges and identity Who am I? I started writing my I am from and I can‚Äôt wait to share it one day. Why am I this way? What cycles of socialization have given me certain messages? üåü Land Acknowledgements I have been curious since I see this element included in many presentations. I always wonder how you do this without being/seeming performative. Research, that‚Äôs how... Simple as that. Understand what took place on the land historically, how that impacts your story, and how it fits into the learning you are facilitating. I can‚Äôt wait to dive into this more. üåü Care Framework I witnessed the most beautiful facilitation that was anchored in this framework ( Humanity, Historical Truths, Critical Consciousness, Race and Racism, and Just Systems). She started by sharing that many of us tend to jump to Just Systems which is typically reactive to an event. But if we start with no one‚Äôs human dignity is up for debate and move through the framework, we can achieve the outcomes we seek. üåü Breathe and Reflect Throughout the session (and the book), there are moments when we are asked to breathe and reflect on certain experiences in our lives. üåü Resources If you are looking for books or visible thinking strategies for your students, it‚Äôs all there. If you need resources to develop as a professional leading this work, she has you covered. The next book that I am going to read is ‚ÄúSocial Justice for the Sensitive Soul.‚Äù I want to understand my ‚Äúlane‚Äù and how to develop it. I associate Social justice work, with raised voices and fists because of what I have seen. This was perfect timing because I do grapple with doing the work as a sensitive soul. üåü Context I spend a lot of time reading and attending professional learning, but I always find myself investigating the context to ensure that it is contextually and culturally relevant to my setting. üåü Marigolds They grow once a year. They are 1 to 5 feet in height. They need 5-6 hours of sunlight every day to grow properly. I close this with, who are the marigolds in your life? Who is giving you life support on this journey? #Learnfwd23 #professionallearning\n\nCreating a Culture of Belonging I recently had the opportunity to attend a conference on Creating a Culture of Belonging in my role as a community trustee of Presidio Hill School in San Francisco. I was excited to be invited as a member of the PHS cohort to attend this very important conference hosted by San Francisco Friends School and Pollyanna. Being a trustee at a school whose mission and vision I believe in as well as whose leader, Lisa Jeli, is one I believe in is an honor and a privilege. The day was filled with learning, opportunity, moments of heartache, and moments of hope, all met with listening to understand and curiosity. Jamil Zaki, author of The War for Kindness, Building Empathy in a Fractured World and an associate professor of psychology at Stanford University was the keynote speaker. He spoke of many critical things related to empathy. The biggest learning for me was to think of empathy as a skill and not a fixed trait. This, of course, is wonderful news for educational institutions. This affirms what we have known all along. Teachers and leaders who prioritize social-emotional learning, building community and relationships, and embracing inclusion and belonging have been building this empathy muscle in students. As Zaki tells us empathic practices lead to empathic habits which leads to empathic people. Empathy is defined as the ‚Äúaction of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another.‚Äù I believe that acts of showing understanding and awareness of others and their experiences can lead to acts of kindness and these acts of kindness can lead to an individual and a collective sense of belonging. In my meditation group, I learned that compassion can be defined as when love meets suffering and is connected to empathy. I saw compassion in the small groups at the workshop as participants shared times when they did not feel belonging. I saw kindness, curiosity, and expressions of empathy.
