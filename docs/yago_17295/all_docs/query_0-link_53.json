        "text": "The 6 month old government of Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed is at present struggling with economic, social and political woes mainly of its own making. Insiders blame President Nasheed’s heavy handed control of his top heavy political administration for the mismanagement of the budget, impractical whole sale changes to the administrative structure, collapse of social and welfare services and the failing economy.\n\nThe high profile faces of Nasheed’s top political appointees show a dominance of close relatives, interspersed with failed politicians and front line radicals from his party Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP). MDP sources report that this dominance of close relatives of President Nasheed, Vice President Dr Waheed and party Chairman Mariya Didi is at the root of emerging deep cracks in the MDP’s general membership. In addition to its inexperience, another factor contributing to Nasheed’s government’s continual mistakes and failures is apparently the lack of cohesion and cooperation in its front ranks. Most political appointees reportedly answer only to President Nasheed and do not undertake any action unless directly ordered by him.\n\nFollowing are some examples of the rampant nepotism and cronyism in President Nasheed’s struggling government.\n\nHousing, Infrastructure and Transport Minister Aslam is married to President Nasheed's 2nd cousin Naseema’s daughter Aishath Rameeza. (Aishath Rameeza is daughter of Naseema & Beru Ramzee ).\n\nHealth Minister Aminath Jameel is married to Sikka Mohamed Ismail Maniku (kuda Sikka), whose elder brother is Sikka Ahmed Ismail Maniku (Bodu Sikka - the convicted November 3rd terrorist leader) who is married to President Nasheed’s aunt (father’s own sister).\n\nPresident Nasheed’s close friend DIK Ali Hashim is Finance Minister, and Acting Attorney General.\n\nPresident Nasheed's father is second cousin to Kerafa Ahmed Naseem, State Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nPresident Nasheed’s classmate and close friend Dr Hussain Rasheed Hassan is State Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture.\n\nFinance Minister Ali Hashim’s business partner Mahmood Raazee is State Minister for Civil Aviation.

Suood is also Prosecutor General Muizzu’s long time business partner in their joint law firm. Soood’s brother-in-law, Dr. Abdul Majeed is the Minister for Islamic Affairs.\n\nPresident Nasheed’s nominee for Speaker of Parliament, his cousin Fazna Ahmed’s husband Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, is MDP MP for Lhaviyani Hinnavaru. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih is also brother of President Nasheed’s long-time lover Fathmath Solih. Ibrahim Solih is also President Nasheed’s class mate and best friend. His wife Fazna Ahmed’s mother is President Nasheed’s aunt. Fazna’s father is Bodu Sikka, the convicted November 3rd terrorist.\n\nPresident Nasheed’s cousin by marriage Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s younger brother Niyaz Solih is Deputy State Minister for Medhu Uthuru Province.\n\nPresident Nasheed’s cousin by marriage Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s elections’ campaign manager Mohamed Mahir is Counselor for Lhaviyani Atoll.\n\nPresident Nasheed's cousin, Eva Abdulla (his aunt Zuheyra's daughter), is MDP MP for Galolhu constituency.\n\nEva Abdulla’s husband Saabe was, until last month, Deputy Chair of the Elections Commission.

He is now nominated for the post of Minister of Home Affairs.\n\nThe above list is just a sampler, quite a remarkable achievement for a President who campaigned against cronyism, nepotism and corruption.\n\nLabels\n\n\"A picture is worth a thousand words.\" President Mohamed Nasheed has appointed Abdullah Shahid as the State Minister of Defense. On the 3rd of November 1988, along with the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelaam), Mr. Abdullah Shahid is one of the key terrorists who masterminded the terrorist attack which claimed the lives of many innocent Maldivians. Now what about National Security?\n\nMale', Maldives. The Canarygate Scandal of political corruption, obstruction of justice and abuse of power which led to Mohamed Nasheed's resignation as President, yesterday entered a new dimension as Nasheed's Israeli connection was revealed to be Ismail Saadiq, of the FPID and 7/11 corruption scandals in the 1990s. Ismail Saadiq, at Nasheed's request, visited Israel after Nasheed's resignation, in a bid to secure Israeli support for Nasheed's come-back bid. Sources close to Nasheed report that Saadiq's visit was to request Israel to pressure the US to support Nasheed's call for an early election. Saadiq and Nasheed's ex-Chief of Staff, Ahmed Mausoom, were in the process of setting up a joint venture for supplying STO Maldives with Israeli oil when Nasheed resigned on February 7th. Saadiq, a Maldivian trader engaged in various corrupt activities, first leapt to local prominence in the late 1970s when he spilled the beans on Kandi Ahmed Maniku'\n\n#Maldives: November 3rd, 2012 marks the 24th anniversary of the bloody massacre that left the blackest of stains on Maldivian hearts and history. Nineteen innocent Maldivians were slaughtered and several injured. Hundreds were held at gunpoint for hours, many later taken away as hostages. Immense damage was given to public and private property. Maldives was rescued by troops sent by Indian Premier Rajiv Gandhi. The leader of the failed coup was a man called Sikka Ahmed Ismail Maniku, a man who had previous convictions for coup attempts against previous governments. The coup leader's nephew, Mohamed Nasheed, was installed as President in 2008, at the head of a political party whose top leadership comprised of family members and others involved in the 1988 November 3 massacre. Nasheed's cabinet, senior political advisors and state ministers included terrorists convicted for their involvement in the November 3 massacre.
