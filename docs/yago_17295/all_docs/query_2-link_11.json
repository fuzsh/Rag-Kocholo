        "text": "Accepts Hindu Dharma and gets married to her Hindu lover\n\nPatna – Naseema Khatoon, a resident of Purnia, Bihar, renounced Islam, embraced Sanatan Dharma and got married to her lover Mahesh Sharma as per Hindu rituals. Naseema Khatoon has now become Meenakshi Sharma. ‘My ancestors accepted Islam due to Mughal invaders. My faith is in Sanatan Dharma. I worship Hindu Deities. Women are not respected in Islam. Bad practices like triple talaq are prevalent in Islam. I have voluntarily done ‘Ghar Vapsi’, she said.\n\nOpposition to ‘Nikah Halala’\n\nNaseema was married to a Muslim man from Agra. She has a one-and-half-year-old daughter. Her husband divorced her 6 months ago. After this, she was pressured for Nikah Halala. When she resisted it, she was kicked out by her family. After this, she started staying at her mother’s house.\n\n‘Nikah Halala’ is a social evil in Islam. If the first husband divorces the wife and wants to marry her again, the woman has to marry someone else and have physical relations with him. The practice of remarrying the first husband after divorce is called ‘nikah halala’.\n\nMarriage after accepting Hindu Dharma\n\nNaseema Khatoon came in contact with Mahesh Sharma, a resident of Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, through ‘Instagram’. Gradually, friendship grew, and later love developed between the two. They decided to get married. She reached Agastya Muni Ashram in Bareilly and embraced Sanatan Dharma according to the Vedic system. Naseema, who has become Meenakshi, got married to Mahesh Sharma.\n\nThreats to Naseema after marriage"
