        "text": "A constitution is a document that outlines the fundamental principles, laws, and regulations that govern a country or an organization. It establishes the framework for the government or organization, and sets out the rights and responsibilities of citizens or members.\n\nConstitutions typically cover a range of topics, such as the structure of the government, the distribution of powers between branches of government, the rights and freedoms of citizens, and the process for amending the constitution itself.\n\nConstitutions can be either written or unwritten. A written constitution is a formal document that is codified in a single document, such as the Constitution of the United States. An unwritten constitution, on the other hand, is not contained in a single document, but is instead made up of a collection of laws, traditions, and customs that have evolved over time, such as the Constitution of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn a democratic country, the Constitution plays a critical role in defining the framework of government and protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens.\n\nPre-Constitutional Period\n\nPre-Islamic:\n\nBefore the advent of Islam in the island nation, there was Monarchical Rule. This meant that the rules there were no written rules or guidelines, and the people followed their customs and traditions (customary law).\n\n“The islands had a king who united them, protected and defended them and made truce according to his ability. His wife acted as arbitrator among the people and did not veil herself from them. When she issued any orders, her husband, the chief, although he was present, did not interfere with any of her ordinances. It had always been a custom with them that women arbitrated, a custom they always upheld.” [1]\n\nAccording to loamaafaanu writings, there was a Highest Judicial Authority, Justices (uthu pendiyaaru, sathisirru pendiyaaru) Council of Nobles (kiyeveli beykalun) and religious functionaries. Judiciary was not separate from the executive. King had collective power to make rules and implement them.\n\nPost-Islamic:\n\nAfter conversion to Islam, the island had a uniform system of Islamic Shariah and Customary Law, which did not contradict with each other. The Affairs of the country was managed by the following figures of the kingdom:\n\nThe King (Ras Kilege): He had the supreme power and the final say in the administrative affairs.\n\nGrand Vizier (Kilege): was the most powerful official of the realm, appointed by the king. Next to the King, and in his absence, he was the most powerful figure in the government of the state, and without his authority nothing was done. If the King wished to do, observe, or execute anything, he was the first person to be deputed and receive his commands.\n\nNobility (Ameerun): After the King, the most powerful people in the kingdom were the Ameerun, appointed by the King from among the members of the royal family to be his advisors.\n\nThe Cabinet (Furadhaana): The Ministers who were subordinate to the Kilege, were responsible for the execution of the orders of the King.\n\nAccording to writings of Ibn Battuta, who was a resident judge in the country for 14 years, there was a separate house to be used for judicial proceedings. Yet, the most important disputes were judged in the palace of the king.\n\nConstitutional Period\n\nThe Constitutional history of the Maldives goes back 85 years, when the First Constitution of the Maldives was written in 1938. This constitution was highly influenced by the UK, and did not grant Maldives much autonomy. Transitioning from monarchial rule to constitutional rule was proven difficult and therefore the very first constitution of the Maldives was publicly torn as a display of how the Maldivian people felt toward it. Since then, Maldives went back and forth from Constitutional Rule to Monarchial rule, sometimes with comprehensive constitutions and some times with very short yet effective constitutions. After the 6 iterations, the Current constitution was established in 2008.\n\nLooking back at some of the constitutions of the Maldives, particularly the 1998 Constitution, which took 17 years to formulate during one of the longest presidencies the country has ever witnessed, was remarkably lacking a crucial part of the element of Rule of Law. Powers were very centralized, and the people had little said in the affairs of the Government. In todays standards, it was not a proper democracy and had many issues that could be discussed at length. This stands to be the reason why the 2008 Constitution of the Maldives was such a major change in the constitutional history of the country."
