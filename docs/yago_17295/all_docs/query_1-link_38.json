        "text": "YUNUS, Mohammed\n\nMay 16, 1927 - Delhi, India\n\nMay 17, 2022 - Calgary, Alberta\n\nDr. Mohammed Yunus, beloved husband, father, grandfather, and brother, passed away just after midnight on May 17, 2022, surrounded by people who love him beyond measure. Dr. Yunus was born to Hakim Zakeria Khan and Mohammadi Begum in 1927 in Delhi, the middle sibling of five children. His life was characterized by a deep intellectual curiosity and fascination with the world that led him first to Aligarh University where he earned degrees in both law and political science, and then to a long career with the Pakistani Foreign Service that saw him living all over the world, rubbing elbows with numerous dignitaries, and embarking on many adventures. After retiring from the diplomatic life in 1982, Dr. Yunus and his family moved to Canada, and he began his second career teaching courses in political science at the University of Calgary. His courses were always oversubscribed by eager students dying to learn from such a charismatic and brilliant professor. During his time at the university, Dr. Yunus also authored several books. Despite these many professional and academic achievements, Dr. Yunus was perhaps most proud of his family. Married in 1953 to his beloved wife Naseema, he was the father of three children, Khalid, Asim, and Shama, the beloved grandfather of seven grandchildren, and great-grandfather of four. Dr. Yunus was the best kind of patriarch - wise, warm, funny, and supportive. He was always ready with a good story or joke and loved to share good food and quality time with his loved ones. He had a tremendous generosity of spirit and his keen mind remained sharp as a tack to the end of his days. Dr. Yunus is survived by his wife of almost seventy years, Naseema, his sons Khalid (Nigar) and Asim (Teri), daughter Shama (Curtis), brother Ahmad (Najma), his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and numerous other family members and dear friends. The impact of this wonderful man on the lives of all who knew him cannot be overstated. He was a teacher, scholar, and storyteller par excellence who enriched the world with his wisdom and good humour. He will be so dearly missed. A celebration of life will be held at McInnis & Holloway (Chapel of The Bells, 2720 Centre Street North, Calgary, AB) on Saturday, June 25, 2022, at 2:00 p.m. All are welcome! Please RSVP at yunuscelebrationjune25@gmail.com. Condolences, memories, and photos may be shared and viewed at ."
