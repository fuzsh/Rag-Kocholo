        "text": "Edward Moore Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on February 22, 1932. His parents were Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Kennedy. He was the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. \"Ted\" Kennedy graduated Harvard University in 1956 and the University of Virginia Law School in 1959. He campaigned for his brother John during the latter's 1960 presidential bid. Ted was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962 and held that position until his death. As a Senator, he had served as majority whip and chaired Senate committees. His rise was hampered by the Chappaquiddick Island incident on July 18, 1969, when he accidentally drove his car off a bridge, resulting in the drowning of his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. He was convicted of leaving the scene of an accident. In 1980, he unsuccessfully challenged Jimmy Carter for the Democratic presidential nomination. In May of 2008, Kennedy experienced a stroke that resulted in hi being diagnosed with brain cancer. He remained active and endorsed President Barack Obama's candidacy early-on. He died at his family compound on Cape Cod in Hyannis, Massachusetts, August 25, 2009."
