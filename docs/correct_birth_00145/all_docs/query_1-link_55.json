        "text": "Edward Moore \"Ted\" Kennedy (February 22, 1932 â€“ August 25, 2009) was the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts and a member of the Democratic Party. He was the second most senior member of the Senate when he died and was the fourth-longest-serving senator in United States history, having served there for almost 47 years. As the most prominent living member of the Kennedy family for many years, he was also the last surviving son of Joseph P. By the later years of his life, he had come to be viewed as a major figure and spokesman for American progressivism."
