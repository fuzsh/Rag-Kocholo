        "text": "Sen. Edward “Ted” Kennedy may have lived in Massachusetts and worked in Washington, D.C., but the “Lion of the Senate” touched several lives in Upstate New York as well, those who knew him said Wednesday.\n\nAs news of Kennedy's death late Tuesday evening began spreading in the national media, local residents past and present offered their recollections of the famed politician.\n\nThere is the wife of an old college friend who described him as “just genuinely nice to everybody,” and a former Utica official who helped him run for president. There's also a community leader who parlayed a local school fundraiser into a lifelong friendship with Kennedy.\n\n‘Frosting on the cake’\n\nRome native Barbara Trevor, born Barbara Paige, had the honor of Kennedy’s attendance at her November 1962 wedding to lawyer Leigh Trevor, now deceased.\n\nLeigh Trevor attended Harvard with Kennedy, and then assisted in his first Senate campaign as a speech writer, Barbara Trevor said Wednesday. After winning the election just weeks earlier, Senator-elect Kennedy arrived at the Zion Episcopal Church in Rome for the wedding along with more than two dozen other campaign workers. Even though national media covered the appearance, the couple thought of it just as having another friend in attendance, Barbara Trevor said.\n\n“It was like frosting on the cake,” she said. “It was a pleasure to have him, but it was a pleasure to have everybody else, all the other workers that Leigh had worked with.”\n\nThe couple moved to Cleveland, Ohio, after their wedding, but divorced later in life, she said.\n\nNow 71, the Chevy Chase, Md., resident discussed Kennedy’s death over dinner Wednesday with other residents of her senior living community. She said it was sad that Kennedy didn’t live to see nationwide health care reform come to fruition.\n\n“That was his baby, and he was one of the one’s who got it through in Massachusetts,” she said. “Now they were going to use some of the things they did in Massachusetts for the rest of the country.”\n\nShe also said she was grateful to have had a glimpse into the life of such an influential political figure.\n\n“It was a very exciting time,” she said. “We didn’t have any money, but we had a lot of excitement, that was for sure.”\n\n‘Greater than either of his brothers’\n\nWhen Kennedy ran for president in 1980, former Utica Comptroller Thomas Nelson took charge of the local campaign effort.\n\nThe registered Republican, who was a registered Democrat at the time, said Wednesday he was “very saddened” to learn of the former senator’s death.\n\n“He’s going to go down as one of America’s great senators,” Nelson said. “His legacy will probably be greater than either of his brothers. He’s done more to shape American public policy in the 20th century and early 21st century than almost anybody else in the last century.”\n\nNelson pointed to Kennedy’s involvement in voting rights legislation, the Civil Rights Act, and freedom of information laws as examples of what he’ll be remembered for.\n\n“You name the progressive legislation of the 20th century, and his name was on it,” he said.\n\nNelson’s wife was chosen as a delegate to the Democratic convention in New York City that year, and the couple attended together. Nelson said Kennedy came “within a few votes” of becoming the Democratic candidate, but eventually lost to incumbent President Jimmy Carter.\n\nNelson said he met Kennedy several times in person and found him to be “extraordinarily gracious.” He also met Kennedy’s nieces – Courtney Kennedy Hill and Maria Shriver – when they visited Utica for a day during the campaign. The itinerary for their visit included stops at several area senior centers, he said.\n\nHe also remembers Kennedy as a “gifted speaker,” and still has records of the “The Dream Continues” speech he gave at the 1980 convention.\n\n“It’s one of the most brilliant speeches given in American politics, and the delivery, it had the whole convention electrified,” he said.\n\n‘A very close friend’\n\n“To appreciate Ted Kennedy, you really had to know him,” said Joseph Caruso of Johnstown. “To appreciate Ted Kennedy, you really had to know where his heart was from.”\n\nCaruso said he first met Kennedy through one of the senator’s aides, a former Marine who served with Caruso during the Vietnam War. The senator then became “a very close friend” after he agreed to appear at a fundraiser Caruso organized for a local Catholic school in 1981.\n\nKennedy’s presence attracted hundreds of dinner guests and helped raise $50,000 for the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic School in Gloversville, delaying its eventual closure, he said.\n\n“It was the most outstanding event that ever took place in this area,” he said. “The fire department came and closed us down; we couldn’t allow anybody else in.”\n\nCaruso estimates that 300 people attended the dinner, with another 150 standing along the walls of the room. Outside, hundreds who were unable to get tickets mingled with about 1,000 protestors from around the state.\n\n“It was a very beautiful night in May, and the Right to Life was picketing us because of Senator Kennedy’s position on abortion,” he said.\n\nEven some priests who attended the dinner refused to sit next to the senator because of the controversy, he added.\n\nKennedy’s other charity work included helping immigrants secure visas for relatives living in other countries, assisting with foreign adoptions, and donating money to help purchase necessary medical equipment for low-income families, Caruso said. He also hosted an annual cocktail party in Boston to raise money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital – often bringing in $250,000 in a single night.\n\nCaruso said people should not remember him for the tragedies in his life, such as the deaths of two brothers and a fatal car accident he was involved in, in Chappaquiddick, Mass., but rather for his acts of charity.\n\n\"To that Indian family, whose mother was dying in India, the man was a living saint,” he said. \"To that couple who could not have a child, who had to go to China to get a child, Senator Kennedy made sure that the paperwork got through. … There are so many things he did that people don’t know.”"
