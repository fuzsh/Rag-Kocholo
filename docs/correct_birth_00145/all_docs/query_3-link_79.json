        "text": "My first thought on hearing that Senator Edward Kennedy had died during the night was that his death might generate a wave of sympathy for Barack Obama's healthcare reform plans. Enough to carry them through Congress by way of a memorial to the Senate's leading liberal, perhaps.\n\nThat's what happened when brother Jack was murdered in Dallas in 1963. Lyndon Johnson, his formidable successor in the White House, was able to push through the stalled civil rights legislation that rescued the republic from racial disaster and – a mere 40 remarkable years later – enabled Obama to become president.\n\nMy second thought was less charitable. On the radio I even misheard \"the lion of his party\" as the \"liar\". Ted Kennedy was lucky not to go to jail over the death of Mary Jo Kopechne, the 28-year-old woman he left to drown when he drove his car off a Chappaquiddick bridge – not far from where the Obamas are now on holiday – in July 1969.\n\nHe got a two-month suspended sentence for leaving the scene of an accident. Anywhere but Massachusetts, where the Kennedy clout was – still is? – legendary, the cover-up that followed the accident would not have held. Was it about drink, sex and bad driving? That's what people assumed at the time, but we still don't know.\n\nThe following year Kennedy, who had succeeded to Jack's old Senate seat in 1962 – when he was just 30 – was re-elected with 62% of the vote. Chappaquiddick cost him just 500,000 fewer votes in his home state, which says something about voters we often forget. Horatio Bottomley, arguably the 20th century's most crooked MP, was re-elected after conviction too.\n\nOf course, the scandal ruined Kennedy's presidential ambitions, though he was still trying in the 80s when I covered events from Washington. I saw him close up several times. Tongue-tied and often inarticulate, he cut a sad figure in many ways. The burden of family history, the last survivor of four brothers goaded towards ambition by their ruthless, bootlegging father, Old Joe, weighed heavily on him.\n\nYoung Joe had been killed as a pilot in the second world war. The president – a figure of great style and presence, but uncertain substance – was assassinated. I was once invited to dinner by Jack's sister, Eunice Shriver (\"you seemed a nice young man on TV\"), and her Washington home was like a shrine. Killed too was her middle brother, Senator Robert Kennedy, the most interesting of the bunch, murdered in Los Angeles as he edged toward the White House that mad, savage summer of 1968.\n\nIn his absence Richard Nixon won. It is one of the great \"what if\"s of recent history. If Bobby had lived and won, as he almost certainly would have done ...\n\nBack to Ted, the kid brother. Here's where it gets interesting. He could have drunk and womanised himself to death (Dad was keen on booze and women); he certainly got hugely fat and was trailed by scandal. But he became and remained – almost to the end – a substantial figure, the man you had to deal with in the Senate, love him or hate him, as the arch-liberal (by US standards) of the upper house.\n\nHe did the work, he had the bright staff and the influence. What Kennedy thought always mattered. We know this in Britain for the pressing reason that he changed his mind on Northern Ireland and played a constructive role in the peace process after being soft on Republican terrorism for many years. In Irish Massachusetts they still think the Brits occupy Dublin Castle.\n\nSo there was redemption, as well as shame and disappointment in the saga of the last of the Kennedy brothers – whose brain cancer would not have been treated in the British NHS, according to those crooks and charlatans now stooping to every available trick to discredit universal healthcare.\n\nThe end of an era indeed. I had just turned 15 when Jack Kennedy was elected, such a glamorous figure, though my old Guardian boss Ian Aitken, then a Washington-based reporter, thought his inaugural speech terrifyingly cold warrior-like.\n\nWe didn't know about the girls then, though we should have guessed, especially when Marilyn Monroe sung Happy Birthday, Mr President at the White House party – as if she was undressing him. Bobby was at it too, it later transpired. Never mind now. Lax sexual morals and political effectiveness are not incompatible.\n\nIn 1963 we were all – students by now – shocked at the scenes in Dallas, not least Jack Ruby's murder of the suspect, Lee Harvey Oswald, in the city's police station.\n\nHow could these things happen? Camelot had been the apotheosis of the American century. The dark side was now coming into view: James Elroy's bleak novel of the moment, American Tabloid, would later tie the mafia, the Cubans, the reactionary right and the CIA into one thread leading to Dallas.\n\nThe murders of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy in 1968 – the hinge year of the disastrous Vietnam war – were shocking, too, but the innocence had long been lost by then. It has not been recovered, though the wider world caught a glimpse of that more wholesome America when the millions poured into Washington in January for the Obama inaugural.\n\nI remain a stubborn believer in the redemptive capacity of American public life. Healthcare reform, the parallel battle over climate change, the unravelling of the Bush administration's torture policies ... It is currently very tough, but this is also evidence of the United States's enduring ability to repair its own mistakes.\n\nTed Kennedy was born to privilege and screwed it up. But he went a long way towards repaying his debts."
