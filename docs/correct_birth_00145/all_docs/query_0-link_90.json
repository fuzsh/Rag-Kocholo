        "text": "Joseph Kennedy Sr.\n\nBorn: Sept. 6, 1888 Died: Nov. 16, 1969\n\nShrewd financier and fabled short-seller on Wall Street, he launched the clan in national politics. He married Rose Fitzgerald, daughter of the mayor of Boston. Roses ancestors, like Joe Kennedys, were Irish farmers who came to the United States in the mid-1800s to escape the potato blight. Kennedy was one of Franklin Roosevelts prime financial backers in his 1932 presidential campaign. FDR appointed Kennedy as the first head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and in 1937 named him as ambassador to Great Britain. The Kennedy family patriarch suffered a stroke in 1961 while playing golf in Palm Beach, Fla.; he was paralyzed and virtually unable to speak until his death eight years later.\n\nRose Fitzgerald Kennedy\n\nBorn: July 22, 1890 Died: Jan. 22, 1995\n\nShe was the granddaughter of an Irish immigrant, daughter of the mayor of Boston and the wife of one of the richest men in America. She was a devout Catholic who buried four of her nine children before she died at the age of 104.\n\nJoseph Kennedy, Jr.\n\nBorn: July 28, 1915 Died: Aug. 12, 1944\n\nHe volunteered for a dangerous World War II air mission against the Nazis and his plane exploded.\n\nJohn Kennedy\n\nBorn: May 29, 1917 Died: Nov. 22, 1963\n\nThe decorated war hero and U.S. senator was elected president in 1960 by a margin of only 114,673 out of 68.8 million votes cast.

He married Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, who died of cancer May 19, 1994. They had two children who died. Jacqueline gave birth to a stillborn child in 1956; in 1963, another died 36 hours after his birth. They had two surviving children.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis\n\nShe was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier. Her early years were divided between New York City and East Hampton, Long Island, where she learned to ride almost as soon as she could walk. She was educated at the best of private schools; she wrote poems and stories, drew illustrations for them, and studied ballet. Jacqueline was dubbed \"the Debutante of the Year\" for the 1947-1948 season. In Washington she took a job as \"inquiring photographer\" for a local newspaper. Her path soon crossed that of Senator Kennedy, who had the reputation of being the most eligible bachelor in the capital. Their romance progressed slowly and privately, but their wedding at Newport in 1953 attracted nationwide publicity. Mrs. Kennedy's gallant courage during the tragedy of her husband's assassination won her the admiration of the world. She moved to New York City; and in 1968 she married the wealthy Greek businessman, Aristotle Onassis, 23 years her senior, who died in March 1975. From 1978 until her death in 1994, Mrs. Onassis worked in New York City as an editor for Doubleday.
