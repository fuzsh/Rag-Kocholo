JFK spent many summers sailing with family in his Wianno Senior “Victura” in these waters. U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy often raced in the legendary Figawi regatta every May in his wooden schooner, Mya.

        "text": "The Kennedy Sailing Tradition\n\nClose by, at the Hyannis Port pier is where Ted Kennedy's beloved sailboat Mya could be seen on its mooring, if he wasn't out winning a race! It wasn’t just Ted and JFK, but most of the Kennedys that have enjoyed taking to the waters in a vessel powered by wind. Today, the next generation of Kennedy sailors race their various Wianno Senior sailboats. The famous Crosby Yacht Yard made the \"Seniors\" in nearby Osterville to navigate our shifting Cape Cod shoals.\n\nBobby Kennedy\n\nRobert “Bobby” Kennedy, active in politics and instrumental in the civil rights movement, was born on November 20, 1925, in Brookline, Massachusetts. He and his wife Ethel, who married in 1950, had eleven children. They purchased the second of three houses that form the Kennedy Compound as their family started to grow. Robert managed his brother John F. Kennedy’s successful senate campaign in 1952, and went on to manage JFK’s national campaign in 1960. JFK appointed him U.S. Attorney General. In that role he worked closely and confidentially with his brother, serving as advisor during difficult times such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. He resigned as attorney general after his brother’s death. He was then elected U.S. Senator from New York. Robert was shot on June 5, 1968, in Los Angeles, California during his campaign for President. He was pronounced dead the following day."
