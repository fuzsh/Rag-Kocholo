        "text": "Rose Kennedy and Her Children\n\nRose Elizabeth Fitzgerald was born in 1890. She learned her political campaigning skills as the daughter of John 'Honey Fitz' Fitzgerald, a politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives (1895-1901 and 1919) and as mayor of Boston (1906-1908, and 1910-1914). She married Joseph P. Kennedy in 1914, and they began their married life in Brookline, Massachusetts. As Rose and Joe's family grew, they sought a summer getaway from the city, which eventually led them to Hyannis Port. As Joe's career and their family grew, Rose managed family life (tracking her nine children's health on index cards) while Joe was appointed by President Roosevelt to chair the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (1934-1935), and the U.S. Maritime Commission (1937-1938). In 1938, Joe was appointed ambassador to the United Kingdom.

I had a wonderful youth; my father gave me the stimulation of travel [and] zest - curiosity and interest and enthusiasm for life. My mother bestowed on me Faith and common sense. I fell in love young and married the man I loved and lived a full life with him - from finance to the movies to politics to diplomacy. I have been ideally happy with my children."
