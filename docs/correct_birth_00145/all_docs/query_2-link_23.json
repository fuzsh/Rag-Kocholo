        "text": "BROOKLINE (CBS/AP) â€” The National Park Service is celebrating the 97th anniversary of its creation by examining the lives of Ted and Eunice Kennedy and how the years they spent growing up in Brookline helped shape them.\n\nThe National Park Service says President John F. Kennedy was the most famous Kennedy sibling, but both Eunice and Ted also made significant contributions to American politics and society.\n\nEunice Kennedy began her life in Brookline and went on to create the Special Olympics, offering new opportunities to many Americans who were previously overlooked.\n\nTed Kennedy was not born in Brookline, but his involvement in the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site greatly influenced the creation of the site at the president's birthplace in the city.\n\nThe youngest brother of President Kennedy, Ted Kennedy was the third longest-serving member of the U.S. Senate in American history. Voters of Massachusetts elected him to the Senate nine times and he served 47 years in the Senate.\n\nIn Photos: Ted Kennedy's life and legacy\n\nThe National Parks Service has organized various special events at the former Kennedy family home in Brookline."
