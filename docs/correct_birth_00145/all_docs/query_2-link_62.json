        "text": "On Feb. 22, 1932, Rose Kennedy gave birth to the last of nine children -- a boy that she and her husband, Joseph, named Edward Moore.\n\nFor a family as political as the Kennedys, it could hardly go unnoticed that their last child was born 200 years to the day after George Washington.\n\nAs fate would have it, the shadow of the presidency has hung over Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy, who turned 70 on Friday, from the moment he was born.\n\nHe was the fourth Kennedy who seemed destined for America's highest elected office, following a brother who was killed in World War II, a second brother slain three years after being elected and a third struck down nearly within grasp of the presidency.\n\nMore than two decades have passed since Kennedy made his own bid for the presidency, a campaign in which he broke with political convention and challenged an incumbent from his own party. The results were disastrous Kennedy lost to Jimmy Carter in 1980, a weakened Carter was trounced by Ronald Reagan, and a Democrat was not elected president for another 12 years.\n\nKennedy never again ran for president, and the years that followed were marred by scandal and tragedy. But the passing of time has also given him perspective and the opportunity to adjust his priorities.\n\nHe married for the second time 10 years ago, a decision he believes grounded his personal life. And he shifted his political focus from \"the constant pursuit of the presidency\" to a career in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAs he marks his 70th birthday and his 40th year in the Senate, Kennedy seems to have stepped out of the long shadow of his family's legacy.\n\nHe now looks back at his 1980 campaign with some humor, evoking the name of another famous figure with whom he shares a birthday.\n\n\"I've always maintained that the Democratic Party should consider following the teachings of the Dalai Lama and look for someone that was born on the Dalai Lama's birthday to be the one that was selected for leadership,\" Kennedy said. \"I was unable to persuade the Democratic Party to assume that position in 1980.\"A senator's day\n\nKennedy was first elected in 1962 and has held his Senate seat ever since.\n\nOnly four senators have served longer terms, including Strom Thurmond, R-South Carolina, and Robert rd, D-West Virginia.\n\nHis days begin in his McLean, Va., home, across the Potomac from Washington, D.C., at 630 a.m.\n\nAfter 20 minutes on a treadmill and stretching exercises for his back -- the brace he needed after a 1964 plane crash nearly killed him was shed several years ago -- he eats breakfast, scans the New York Times and Washington Post, and typically sits down to read with his 16-year-old stepdaughter, Caroline.\n\nKennedy reaches his office across the street from the Capitol Building by 9 a.m., shortly before a daily 30-minute meeting with staffers.\n\nAs Kennedy spoke with his aides, his black, curly-haired Portuguese waterdog, Splash, napped on the floor behind him close to a pair of gnarled tennis balls. The other family dog of the same breed, Sunny, was back home in McLean.\n\nThe mementos adorning Kennedy's office are a mix of family history and American political lore An American flag in one corner stood in the Oval Office while John F. Kennedy was president.\n\nOne of the photographs in the office shows Edward Kennedy as a boy with his family in England, while his father was U.S. ambassador and World War II was brewing in Europe. Another photograph shows his uniformed older brother, Joseph, who was killed during the war.\n\nMany of the photos are of children, young and grown, his own and those of siblings, smiling, exuberant and unsullied by loss.\n\nOn the corner of Kennedy's large wooden desk sits an old ship's compass and a large model of a schooner rests on the mantle over a fireplace.\n\nThe staff briefing was interrupted by a call from Education Secretary Roderick Paige.\n\n\"We're trying to get more resources on this,\" Kennedy told Paige, a reference to early education, before pausing. \"So that you can do a better job over there.\"\n\nAnother pause, a deep laugh, and Kennedy winks.\n\nSeveral minutes later, he has made his way to a Senate meeting room for a hearing on early education funding (he is chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee), It is the first of two scheduled hearings that day, the second concerning refugee admission to the United States.\n\nAfter a large crowd settled in for the hearing, Kennedy apologized that the session would be interrupted by three votes in the Senate.\n\nShortly before the first vote at 1045 a.m., Kennedy hurried to the basement of the Russell office building, where a clean and odorless open-car subway line links the building with the Capitol.\n\nHe walked briskly with a pigeon-toed gait, leaning slightly forward and occasionally leaving himself winded and sweating.\n\nAfter the Senate voted he spoke at a press conference with California congressman George Miller. Both criticized the Bush budget on education funding.A new chapter\n\nIn June 1991, the 59-year-old Kennedy began dating Victoria Reggie, a Washington lawyer 22 years younger than him.\n\nA year later, Kennedy and Reggie married at his 21-room Virginia home and a new chapter in his life began.\n\nThe focus on lawmaking and the settled routines of his domestic life have put the caricatures of Kennedy as a drunken buffoon into the history books, now seeming as distant as the scandals that gave rise to them -- the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick in 1969, late night carousing with a nephew subsequently charged with rape in 1991, the persistent rumors of wine and women.\n\nAnd as those memories faded, Kennedy's stature continued to grow over the last decade, aided by the presence of Bill Clinton, a sympathetic Democrat in the White House, and the end to decades of tabloid stories about him.\n\nIn a 1999 biography of Kennedy, New York Times reporter Adam Clymer offered what many considered a radical premise -- that Kennedy, for all his flaws, was among the most effective legislators in American history.\n\nKennedy had become \"a lawmaker of skill, experience and purpose rarely surpassed since 1789,\" Clymer wrote.\n\nBut the personal tragedies continued. His sister-in-law, Jacqueline Onassis, died of cancer in May 1994 at age 64. Two nephews, Michael Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr., were killed in accidents during the late 1990s.\n\nWith each family tragedy, however, the perception of Kennedy as an undisciplined, overage frat boy was replaced by one of him as the protective patriarch of a clan in mourning.\n\n\"I think after young John's death, a lot of people saw a side of him that was always there,\" said Cape radio talk show host Don McKeag, a former Hyannisport neighbor.\n\nDuring an interview in his office in the Capitol, with its commanding third-floor view of the National Mall, Kennedy said the losses in his life left him doubting his capacity for love.\n\nBut the last 10 years \"have been the happiest of my life,\" he said.\n\nBefore marrying Reggie, Kennedy said he questioned if would ever have \"the opportunity to care as deeply as I do for her, or if I would, because the people that I had been so close to were basically taken from me.\n\n\"And so I think there was a question in my own mind of whether I'd ever really become as attached and committed as I have to Vickie, and she has made an enormous difference in terms of my own happiness,\" he said.\n\nWithout elaborating on his earlier difficulties, Kennedy added that \"it's obviously not the kind of balance that you have when you have the kind of fulfillment and love that you have, that I have now.\"\n\nKennedy's first marriage to Joan Kennedy ended in divorce. They have three children together Kara, Edward Jr., and Patrick, who represents Rhode Island in Congress.making a difference\n\nAt noon Tuesday, Kennedy left Capitol Hill for a weekly ritual he has pursued for five years.\n\nAn aide drove him to the Brent Elementary School six blocks away, where Kennedy read to 11-year-old Jasmine Harrison for an hour.\n\nAlong with a few other senators and House members, Kennedy is a volunteer in a mentoring program for elementary-age students.\n\nHe and Jasmine sat in a corner in the library, with six other adult volunteers and their charges scattered around the room.\n\nTogether they read from author Madeleine L'Engle's \"A Swiftly Tilting Planet.\"\n\nKennedy doesn't like to miss the reading sessions, said aide Stephanie Cutter, 33, a Raynham native and former Clinton staffer who began working for Kennedy last summer.\n\n\"Unless it's a vote,\" she said. \"He hates to miss votes.\"\n\nProgram coordinator Shirley Farrow thinks Kennedy has made a difference in Jasmine's life.\n\n\"She's much more confident,\" Farrow says. \"He makes sure she writes down words and looks them up in the dictionary.\"\n\nKennedy plans to speak at the school's graduation this spring, when Jasmine finishes the sixth grade. This will be their last year together.\n\n\"We had a lot of words today,\" Jasmine said after the session, \"and there were some words we didn't find in the dictionary that the author must have made up.\"\n\nShe was aware of the senator's approaching birthday, and had created a birthday card for him with markers and yellow construction paper.\n\n\"Happy birthday Ted!,\" Jasmine wrote. \"I'm really glad that you were able to celebrate another year of life. I hope your birthday is wonderful and may all your wishes come true! God bless you and your family and again Happy Birthday!\" Returning to the Capitol, Kennedy met with officials from Great Britain and Northern Ireland for a closed-door discussion of the prospects for peace.\n\nAnother briefing with staffers followed before the hearing on refugees.growing influence\n\nKennedy began to gain more clout when former House Speaker Tip O'Neill, one of the most powerful Democrats in the country, retired from Congress in 1987.\n\nO'Neill's departure left Kennedy and the late U.S. Rep. J. Joseph Moakley as Massachusetts' main sources of federal largesse, which has flowed by the millions to the Bay State.\n\nIn 1986, when Gov. Michael Dukakis was weighing a run for president, he first called Kennedy, recounts former Dukakis aide Spiro Mitrokostas, now the executive director of the Cape Cod Technology Council.\n\n\"They didn't call (former New York Gov.) Mario (Cuomo), they called Ted,\" Mitrokostas said. \"And the bottom line was that he wasn't going to run without showing him deference first.\"\n\nFour years later, former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas ran for president without calling Kennedy first. His campaign barely lasted past the New Hampshire primary.\n\n\"There is something to be said for asking Ted for his support when you are running for president,\" Mitrokostas said.\n\nStill, Kennedy has had his own political challenges in recent years. In 1994, for example, he faced formidable opposition from Republican businessman Mitt Romney, who is now president of the Salt Lake Olympic organizing committee.\n\nRomney lost to Kennedy, but he gave the incumbent senator his biggest scare in years. In Barnstable County, for example, where Kennedy has seen comfortable margins of victory continue to grow over the years, Kennedy edged Romney by a mere 4 percent of the vote.\n\nIn comparison, two years ago Kennedy soundly defeated Republican challenger Jack E. Robinson by 38.7 percent of the vote.new alliances\n\nKennedy's reputation has also been strengthened by a growing body of legislation he has co-authored or sponsored.\n\nWhile Kennedy is seen as a \"pied piper for liberals,\" said state Rep. Thomas George, a Yarmouth Republican, he also has earned a reputation for working across the aisle.\n\nHe co-wrote legislation on health care portability with former Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, a bioterrorism bill with Republican Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee and a patients bill of rights with John McCain of Arizona.\n\nKennedy also formed an alliance with President Bush on several key issues, including an education reform bill signed into law by Bush last month.\n\nBush looks to Kennedy and sees that \"this political game is a game of experience and longevity, and you can't deny that the man has both,\" Rep. George said.\n\nKennedy is also enough of a politician to know the value of a kind gesture toward a fellow senator inclined to disagree with him.\n\nWhen McCain was picked for the Kennedy Library's Profile in Courage Award three years ago, he initially said he could not attend the ceremony because it conflicted with the birthday of his son, Jimmy, 10.\n\nKennedy chartered a Duckmobile to take McCain and his son through Boston Harbor and orchestrated a party for the McCains on the boat.\n\n\"My son has never forgotten it,\" said McCain. \"And neither have I.\"\n\nKennedy returns to Hyannisport every few weeks in the off-season, weather permitting. He walks along the beach with his dogs, paints watercolors, shops for antiques, invites family and friends for dinner.\n\nMcKeag, 62, known for his scathing political criticism on his morning talk show with co-host Ed Lambert, is sometimes asked how he and Ted Kennedy remain friends.\n\nMcKeag said. \"The politics of humanity is what we agree on.\"\n\n\"He takes his positions very seriously but he doesn't take himself very seriously, and I think that's one of the things that endears him to people,\" McKeag said."
