        "text": "For those unable to visit the house when tours are offered, there is an option to take a self-guided tour between 12 PM and 1 PM and 4 PM and 5 PM. For information, there is a free cell phone audio tour that you can use and a free audio tour narrated by Rose Kennedy (get the audio device at the Visitor Center). The Rose Kennedy tour is available in English, Spanish, Japanese, German, and French. My suggestion is to take a guided tour if at all possible.\n\nAccessing all levels of the house requires walking down stairs, so those in wheelchairs or who have trouble climbing stairs will not be able to tour the house. Rangers will be happy to give a lecture and show photographs of the house in the backyard for those who cannot walk. If interested, please call ahead to make arrangements: (617) 566-7937.\n\nWhen I visited on a Saturday in early August, I got on a tour immediately, but there was a one-hour wait shortly thereafter (not bad for a Saturday at the home of one of the more popular presidents). With tours limited to nine people, large groups may have a longer wait than individuals or couples. If you canâ€™t wait until the next opening, perhaps a self-guided tour may work better.\n\nWhile waiting for a tour to begin, you can shop for books and souvenirs in the basement gift store or watch a 20-minute documentary about the Kennedy family that is narrated by Ted Kennedy. The film usually starts every half hour, but if enough people are milling around, it will show continuously (which is usually the case). There is no objectionable material, so the film is suitable for all ages.\n\nThe Beals Street house was built in 1909 as part of a budding suburban community that sprung up after trolley service came to Beacon Street in 1899. The trolley bus still stops on Beacon Street (Coolidge Corner Station), and it is only a half-mile walk to John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site. When you get off the train, walk along Harvard Street towards what looks like a castle turret with a clock on it.\n\nStreet parking is available on Beals Street, but limited to two hours. If there is a wait for the house tour, you may be pushing the time limit. There are no meters, and when I asked how you would know when two hours were up, I was told that youâ€™d know when you got a ticket.\n\nHOUSE HISTORY\n\nWhen the newly married Joseph and Rose Kennedy purchased the house at 83 Beals Street in 1914, it was the last house on the street. It had been built in 1909, and most of the existing houses on the street were also from that time period. It wasnâ€™t until 1899 that street car service came to Brookline, making a life in the suburbs of Boston practical for those working in the city.\n\nThe Kennedyâ€™s first son, Joseph Jr. (1915-1944), lived in the house, but he was actually born at the familyâ€™s summer home in Hull. John (1917-1963), Rose Marie (1918-2005), and Kathleen (1920-1948) were all bornâ€”literallyâ€”in the house. Kathleenâ€™s birth was the straw that broke the camelâ€™s back as far as the 2,000-square-foot Beals Street house was concerned, so the Kennedys moved a few blocks away to a 5,000-square-foot house on Abbottsford Road (Eunice, Patricia, and Robert were born there). The family lived on Abbottsford Road until 1927, then moved to New York. Joseph Kennedy Sr. was by then a stock broker, plus he claimed there was too much prejudice against Catholics in Boston.\n\nWhen John became president in 1961, the town of Brookline asked the current owner of the Beals Street house, Martha Pollack, if a plaque could be placed in front of the house to commemorate the new president. Pollack agreed, and this plaque still sits in the front yard.\n\nWhen John was assassinated in 1963, the house had been out of the family for over forty years. However, in 1965 the Kennedys were able to repurchase it from Martha Pollack. Rose Kennedy then hired decorator Robert Luddington, and together they created a memorial to John and furnished the house as it was in 1917 (to the best of Roseâ€™s memory). The renovation took three years, and when done, the house was donated to the National Park Service. It opened to the public in 1969.\n\nHOUSE TOUR\n\nThe guided tour of the Beals Street house focuses on all members of the Kennedy family who lived in the house, not just John. The tour covers the first and second floors. The top floor is where two servants lived, but this area is now used as office space for the National Park Service and is closed to the pubic.\n\nThe first room entered is the parlor where guests were greeted and entertained. Most of the furniture and decorations did not belong to the Kennedys but are representative of what they would have owned. The Japanese vases on the mantel, one of the Persian rugs, and the piano are Kennedy items and were in the room when they lived in the house. The piano was a wedding present to Joseph and Rose.\n\nThe dining room has the most original furniture of all rooms in the house. Roughly ninety percent of the items belonged to the Kennedys. The china and silverware are wedding presents, so these were certainly in the house in 1917.\n\nThe bowls on the childrenâ€™s table are inscribed with J. P. C. Jr. (Joseph Jr.) and JFK. The JFK bowl (smaller of the two) is the only item in the house that personally belonged to John.\n\nOf the four children who lived in the house, John, Rose Marie, and Kathleen were born in the master bedroom on the second floor. It was not typical for people to be born in hospitals in the early 1900s, so home births were nothing out of the ordinary. The bed on the far side of the room is the actual bed on which John was born in 1917. (Jimmy Carter was the first president born in a hospital (1924)).\n\nThe bassinet with the blue ribbon in the nursery was used by all nine of the Kennedy children, as well as Johnâ€™s daughter Caroline. The christening gown and bonnet were also used by all of the children.\n\nThe third bedroom on the second floor was a guest room in 1917, and thatâ€™s how it is decorated. When the two girls were born, this became their room.\n\nRose Kennedy kept a small office on the floor.\n\nThe final stop on the tour is the kitchen. The appliances are all antiques, for the originals were thrown away as they became obsolete.\n\nWhen done with the house tour, you are invited to take a walking tour of the Brookline neighborhood. The park brochure that is available in the Visitor Center has the route. The tour takes you past the Abbottsford Road house, as well as four other areas that were important in Johnâ€™s life when he was young.\n\nAt 2:15 PM each day that the John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site is open, a Ranger leads a 45-minute tour to of the neighborhood that leads to Abbottsford house. The house is now privately owned and can only be viewed from the outside. See the Neighborhood Walking Tour web page here on National Park Planner for more information."
