        "text": "Ted Kennedy (born February 22, 1932, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died August 25, 2009, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts) was a U.S. senator representing Massachusetts from 1962 to 2009. He was a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and in liberal politics beginning in the 1960s, and he became one of the most influential and respected members of the Senate during his long tenure in office. A member of what is arguably the most famous political family in modern American history, he was the youngest child of Rose and Joseph Kennedy and the last surviving brother of Pres. John F. Kennedy. His other brother, Robert Kennedy, was also a U.S. Senator, and his sister, Eunice, founded the Special Olympics in 1968.\n\nTed Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1956. He then studied at the International Law School (The Hague) and received a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1959. He campaigned for his brother John in the 1960 presidential race and in 1962 was elected to the president’s former U.S. Senate seat representing Massachusetts. The following year John was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Although unable to campaign actively for reelection in 1964 for a full term because of an injury, Kennedy was swept back into office by a landslide vote. In 1968 he lent his support to his brother Robert’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. However, Robert was assassinated in June of that year.\n\nEarly in 1969 Kennedy was elected majority whip in the U.S. Senate, and he became an early front-runner for the next Democratic presidential nomination. Then, on the night of July 18–19, 1969, Kennedy drove a car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, near Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. His companion in the car, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, died. Kennedy pleaded guilty of leaving the scene of an accident. He was reelected to the Senate in 1970 but announced that he would not seek the presidency in 1972.\n\nKennedy won reelection to a third full term as senator in 1976. He was a serious contender for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew from the race during the convention. He won a fourth term in 1982 and was again reelected to the Senate in 1988, 1994, 2000, and 2006.\n\nKennedy continued to be a prominent spokesman for the policies that had come to be associated with his family name—i.e., support for social welfare legislation and active participation in world affairs. He became a leading advocate in the Senate for many liberal causes, including voting rights, fair housing, consumer protection, and national health insurance. At the same time, he was recognized for his willingness to cooperate with Republicans in the Senate to advance important legislation, such as the No Child Left Behind Act (2001) and other initiatives of the administration of Pres. George W. Bush.\n\nIn 2008, after being hospitalized for a seizure, Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. In March 2009 he was made an honorary Knight of the British Empire, and on August 15 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (it was accepted on his behalf by his children); 10 days later he died at his home.\n\nIn his eulogy for Kennedy, Pres. Barack Obama called him the “soul of the Democratic Party” and the “greatest legislator of our time.”\n\nKennedy’s autobiography, True Compass, was published in September 2009."
