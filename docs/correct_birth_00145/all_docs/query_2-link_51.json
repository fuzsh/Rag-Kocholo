        "text": "That exacting eye for detail is evident in Watson’s writing, both in his book—Style & Simplicity: An A to Z Guide to Living a More Beautiful Life(Sterling Signature, 2014)—and online, in his blog, tedkennedywatson.com, where he makes daily observations on elements of beauty he encounters, such as the tulips available at the Pike Place Market or a pretty table setting he improvised for dinner on Vashon Island.\n\nFor Watson, setting a table is akin to painting. “I like a table to have a bit of a story, or at least spark conversation,” he says. “I put some interesting objects about, as well as unscented candles and always flowers. I am a big proponent of using single-stem vases and clear, short drinking glasses as vases. It spreads the visual joy around the table and also keeps the flowers low. I think you really seethe flower when you look down upon it.”\n\nWatson is lucky enough to have the best flowers just steps from one of his shops, from the stalls in the Pike Place Market. “I am so lucky to get to know these hardworking folks who grow the flowers, load them up each morning, bring them to their stalls, sell them, and then do it all over again the next day,” he says. “It is a labor of love.”\n\nFor a summer table, Watson turns to the reliable drama of hydrangea blooms. “I love the variation of blues,” he says. “I also love blue and green together, and hydrangeas have some of the very best leaves. Rarely do I ever put another flower with them, as they are just so beautiful massed together or as little single blooms dotting the table.” As for so many gifted designers, flowers never fail to provide Watson with the seasonally shifting inspiration he finds everywhere."
