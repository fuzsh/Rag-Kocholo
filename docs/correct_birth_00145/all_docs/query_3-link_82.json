        "text": "Senator Edward Kennedy, who died Tuesday aged 77, was the liberal lion of US politics, a towering, controversial figure whose death ends an era when his family appeared born to rule.\n\nSenator Kennedy in many ways epitomised the wealthy, Ivy League-educated elite of the United States, a status detractors said enabled him to dodge fallout from scandals in his personal life.\n\nYet he also suffered extraordinary tragedy, with the assassinations of president John F Kennedy in November 1963 and his other elder brother, the senator and former attorney-general Robert Kennedy, in June 1968.\n\nBy the end of his life, following nearly five decades as a Democratic senator, Senator Kennedy had won huge admiration for his dedication and his defiance of the brain cancer that ultimately killed him.\n\nEdward Moore Kennedy, best known as Ted Kennedy, was born February 22, 1932, into the strongly Roman Catholic, Irish-American clan headed by banker Joseph Kennedy and his wife, Rose.\n\nThe youngest of nine children, Senator Kennedy attended Harvard University. He was expelled for cheating in an exam, but returned to earn both a degree and fame for his American football skills.\n\nTold by the head coach of the Green Bay Packers that he might have a future as a professional football player, Senator Kennedy quipped that he would instead enter law school then play \"another contact sport: politics\".\n\nHe did just that. Pushed by an ambitious father, he was 30 when he won the Senate seat in strongly liberal Massachusetts earlier vacated by John F Kennedy on election as president in 1960.\n\nBut the Senator Kennedy brothers' golden age collapsed into a seemingly endless spiral of bad luck and tragedy.\n\nIn 1964, the year after John F Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, Texas, Ted Kennedy narrowly escaped death in a plane crash that killed an aide and the pilot.\n\nThen in 1968, his brother Robert was murdered just as he was gaining momentum in a presidential bid.\n\nThis left Ted Kennedy the figurehead of US liberalism and, many thought, an extraordinary candidate for the White House.\n\nScandals\n\nBut those dreams disintegrated the following year, 1969, when he accidentally drove off a bridge at Chappaquiddick in Massachusetts, killing a female companion, Mary Jo Kopechne.\n\nThe scandal deepened when it emerged that Senator Kennedy had swum to safety from the car, leaving Ms Kopechne behind, then waited until the following day to report the incident.\n\nThe young Senator got away with a two-month suspended sentence for leaving the scene of an accident and he won easy reelection to the Senate.\n\nBut the incident tarnished his image. He repeatedly put off running for the presidency, then lost the Democratic nomination to Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election.\n\nChappaquiddick wasn't the last embarrassing episode to dog Senator Kennedy, lampooned in the tabloids as a boozing skirt-chaser.\n\nEpisodes included being allegedly caught in flagrant delicto with a waitress on the floor of a Washington restaurant and cruising the halls of the Capitol with another senator looking for young female pages.\n\nHe also went through difficult times at home, where the family was coping with the amputation of a 12-year-old son's cancerous leg, and he and his wife Joan ended their 22-year marriage.\n\nIn 1991, Senator Kennedy's career teetered on oblivion after his nephew William Smith was charged with raping a woman at the end of a night out with the senator. Smith was acquitted, but the media frenzy damaged Senator Kennedy.\n\nHe issued a public mea culpa about \"faults in the conduct of my private life\" and the following year remarried, rebuilt his career, and cruised to reelection in 1994.\n\nLiberal lion\n\nTed Kennedy earned a reputation as the country's liberal lion, aggressively pushing for legislation on causes such as immigration, voter rights, and gun control.\n\nDuring George W Bush's tumultuous presidency, Senator Kennedy emerged as a senior opponent to the invasion of Iraq. He accused Mr Bush of exaggerating the threats posed by Saddam Hussein and compared Bush's policies to Richard Nixon's war in Vietnam.\n\nSenator Kennedy again surged to the forefront of US politics in his family's crucial support during the 2008 presidential election for Barack Obama, a figure that some saw as a modern version of John F Kennedy.\n\nMr Obama's focus on health care reform then gave Senator Kennedy his last big political battle.\n\nServing as chair of the Senate Health Education, Labor and Pension Committee and called fixing the troubled health care system \"the cause of my life\".\n\nIt was only Senator Kennedy's own failing health that slowed him in the end.\n\nHe was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2008 and he collapsed during lunch at Mr Obama's inauguration in January.\n\nThe death this August of his sister Eunice Shriver, founder of the Special Olympics, emphasised the passing of their generation.\n\nA few days later, Senator Kennedy was so sick that he could not even travel to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Mr Obama, sending his children to accept the honour on his behalf instead.\n\nSenator Kennedy is survived by his second wife, Victoria, and his three children: Kara, Edward Kennedy Junior, and Patrick, who is a member of the House of Representatives."
