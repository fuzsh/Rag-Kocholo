        "text": "Ted Kennedy Jr. might soon join the family business of politics.\n\nThe eldest son of the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy and nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy plans to run for the state Senate in his home state of Connecticut, according to a local report. The younger Kennedy, a Democrat, will campaign for the 12th district seat, which is currently held by Ed Meyer, a Democrat set to retire.\n\nKennedy, 52, has become increasingly active in politics in recent years which aligns with his family's name. He considered a run for his late father's Senate seat in Massachusetts in 2009 after the elder Kennedy's death from a brain tumor but decided against it in part because he resides in Connecticut.\n\nThe younger Kennedy delivered a stirring eulogy at the late senator's funeral, noting his own struggle with bone cancer as a 12-year-old boy.\n\n\"He lifted me up in his strong, gentle arms and said something I will never forget. He said: 'I know you can do it. There is nothing that you can't do. We're going to climb that hill together, even if it takes us all day,'\" Kennedy said at the funeral Mass about his father helping him adapt to using his artificial leg.\n\nKennedy currently works at Epstein Becker Green, out of the law firm's office in Stamford, Conn. He and his wife, Kiki, have two children.\n\nThe local report suggested Kennedy will announce his intent to run for office on Tuesday from a library in his hometown of Branford, Conn.\n\nCorrection: This post has been updated to reflect Ted Kennedy Jr.'s current place of employment."
