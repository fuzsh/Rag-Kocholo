        "text": "BROOKLINE — In a modest home on a residential street in Brookline, a boy named Jack was born in 1917. A child who was frequently sick, he developed a love of reading on his sickbed. Through evening quizzes and debates at the dinner table, his mother taught him curiosity about the world. His father taught him the value of competition. “I don’t want any losers in my house,” his father would say.\n\nThat boy would grow up to be President John F. Kennedy, the man who shaped the Civil Rights bill, supported the space race and led the country through the Cuban missile crisis. After Kennedy was assassinated, the home where he was born would be restored by his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, and turned into a national historic landmark.\n\nOn Nov. 25, 1963, three days after Kennedy was assassinated, hundreds gathered in front of 83 Beals St. to commemorate a national day of mourning with speeches, prayers, a wreath-laying ceremony and a 21-gun salute. Although the house is typically only open for tours May through October or by appointment, it will reopen this year on the weekend of Nov. 23-24 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Kennedy’s assassination with a wreath-laying ceremony, dialogue-based program and tours.\n\n“The intent is not to focus on his death, but his legacy,” said Jim Roberts, supervisory park ranger at the site.\n\nKennedy spent the first 10 years of his life in Brookline, the first three years in the Beals Street home. With four children, their parents and two maids sharing one bathroom, the family outgrew the house by 1920, and moved a few blocks away to a larger house on Abbottsford Road, where three more children were born. In 1927, the Kennedy family moved to New York.\n\nNational Park Service Ranger Sara Patton, who gives tours at the Beals Street home, said it was in Brookline where a young John F. Kennedy absorbed many of the family influences that would stay with him throughout his life.\n\nIn the later years, the family would move more frequently. Their father, Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr., would take an ambassadorship in Great Britain in 1938. The boys would attend boarding schools. “In many ways, the Brookline years are really crucial,” Patton said. “This is one of the last places they actually have a room of their own.”\n\nIn Brookline, John F. Kennedy attended the Edward Devotion School, a public school, until third grade, when his father switched him to the private Dexter School. The Kennedy boys were the only Irish Catholics there. The family prayed at Saint Aidan’s Roman Catholic Church.\n\nVisitors to the Beals Street home can see a twin bed in the Kennedy parents’ room, similar to the one on which the future president was born. “We always used the bed near the window so that if the baby were born in the daytime, the light would be the best for the doctor,” Rose Kennedy explains in a recording at the home.\n\nThe small nursery contains an original wicker bassinet and the christening cap and gown used by three generations of Kennedy children. A chair displays two of John F. Kennedy’s favorite childhood books – \"King Arthur and his Knights\" and \"Billy Whiskers’ Kids.\"\n\nThere is a small office belonging to Rose Kennedy, where she perfected her theory of “scientific motherhood,” a philosophy that led her to document her children’s medical histories on cards, to measure the temperature of their bathwater and even limit the number of hugs she gave her children each day. Relics that Rose Kennedy placed around the home indicate that she taught her children to be curious about travel, to love books and appreciate music.\n\nThe president’s father encouraged his children to compete in sports, and pushed them to win, Patton said. He was openly affectionate and gave each child 15 minutes of his undivided attention each day.\n\nAfter the Kennedys moved, both homes were sold to private owners. The Abbottsford Road house remains under private ownership. The Beals Street house was first commemorated with a plaque placed by the town of Brookline in 1961, after Kennedy was elected president. After Kennedy’s assassination, the home turned into a gathering place for mourners. Owner Martha Pollack decided in 1966 to sell the house back to the Kennedy family.\n\nRose Kennedy restored the home to the way she remembered it from 1917, with flowered drapes, embroidered Irish bed linens and family photos lining the walls. Around 20 percent of the furnishings are original, while the rest are period antiques or reproductions chosen by Rose Kennedy.\n\nIn 1969, the Kennedys donated the house to the National Park Service, which still manages it today. The house gets approximately 22,000 visitors a year.\n\n“(Rose Kennedy) always called this home her gift to the American people,” Patton said.\n\nAfter leaving Brookline, John F. Kennedy would eventually return to Massachusetts to attend Harvard University in Cambridge, then move to Boston when he ran for and served in Congress.\n\nOn Jan. 9, 1961, president-elect Kennedy delivered an address to the people of Massachusetts at the State House in Boston. “For 43 years – whether I was in London, Washington, the South Pacific, or elsewhere – this has been my home,” Kennedy said. “And, God willing, wherever I serve this shall remain my home.”"
