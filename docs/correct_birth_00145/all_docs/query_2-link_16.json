        "text": "Introduction\n\nApart from the Roosevelts of New York, no family played a more prominent role in American political life during the 20th century than the Kennedys of Massachusetts. One son, John F. Kennedy, became president. Another, Robert Francis, served as attorney general of the United States and as senator from New York. The youngest son, Edward Moore, became a senator from his home state.\n\nThe father, Joseph P. Kennedy, was the grandson of an Irish immigrant. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard University in 1912. In 1914 he married Rose Fitzgerald, daughter of John F. Fitzgerald, the mayor of Boston. Kennedy had a remarkable knack for making money. At 25 he was a bank president, and by age 30 he had become a millionaire. By means of shrewd stock investments during the 1920s, he made enough money to retire and set up million-dollar trust funds for his children. During the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennedy served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1934 to 1935 and as ambassador to Great Britain from 1937 to 1940. He later lived in retirement at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where he died in 1969.\n\nRose and Joseph Kennedy had nine children: Joseph P., Jr.; John Fitzgerald; Rosemary; Kathleen; Eunice; Patricia; Robert Francis; Jean; and Edward Moore, commonly known as “Ted.” Joseph P., Jr., whom his father had intended for public office, was killed while serving in World War II. Rosemary was discovered to be mentally ill and was put into a private institution. Kathleen died in a plane crash in Europe in 1948. Eunice married R. Sargent Shriver, who became head of the Peace Corps under President Kennedy. Patricia was, for a time, married to actor Peter Lawford. Jean married businessman Stephen Smith.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy\n\nBorn in Brookline, Massachusetts, on November 20, 1925, Robert Kennedy attended Harvard University and the University of Virginia Law School. He worked in the Justice Department and served on several Senate committee staffs before being named attorney general by his brother John in 1961. He resigned the post in 1964, nearly a year after his brother’s assassination. In 1964 he was elected in New York to the United States Senate. In 1968 he campaigned for the presidency in opposition to the Vietnam War. On June 5, during a victory celebration following the California primary, he was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, an Arab immigrant. He died the next day, leaving his wife, Ethel, with their 11 children, the last of whom was born after Robert’s death.\n\nEdward M. “Ted” Kennedy\n\nTed Kennedy was born in Boston on February 22, 1932. His college education at Harvard spanned 1950 to 1956, being interrupted by two years of military service. He graduated from the University of Virginia Law School in 1959 and worked on his brother John’s presidential campaign in 1960. In 1962 he was elected in Massachusetts to the United States Senate. Throughout his senatorial career, he was considered to be a potential presidential candidate. In the summer of 1969 his career suffered a setback when he was involved in an automobile accident at Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts. This incident led to the death of a young woman. The suspicious circumstances surrounding the accident caused a scandal, but Kennedy was nevertheless reelected in 1970. He refused to accept either the presidential or vice-presidential nomination in 1972, and in 1976 the presidential nomination went to Jimmy Carter.\n\nDisagreement with Carter’s economic policies and style of leadership inspired Kennedy to campaign for the presidency in 1980. Carter successfully staved off the Kennedy drive, but the split in the Democratic party probably helped Ronald Reagan defeat Carter in the fall elections. Kennedy remained in the Senate and was considered one of the champions of liberal policies that were the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson. In 2008 Ted Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. The next year President Barack Obama awarded him the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom. Kennedy’s sister Eunice died on August 11, 2009. Ted, however, was too ill to attend her funeral mass. He died at his home in Hyannis Port on August 25, 2009."
