        "text": "“Good Omens began life with the BBC, and the BBC went, ‘It’s much too big for us, we need some kind of partner,'\" Gaiman said at Prime Video Presents, Amazon's TV showcase in London. \"And we went to Amazon who said, ‘We don’t really want to be your partners; we’d like it if you made it for us.’\"\n\nGood Omens starring David Tennant and Michael Sheen will be released first on Amazon Prime Video in 2019, with a later broadcast expected on BBC2.\n\nGaiman and co-author Pratchett have seen a number of adaptations of Good Omens fall through since they first published the work in 1990. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam repeatedly tried to develop a movie version of the book, while in 2011 it was reported that Terry Jones and Gavin Scott had developed an adaptation for television. However, those projects never materialised.\n\nMore like this\n\nWhen is Good Omens released on Amazon Prime?\n\nNeil Gaiman sends special message to Good Omens team with thanks “from Terry Pratchett” as principal photography wraps\n\nGood Omens star David Tennant: “it’s quite unlike anything I’ve ever been in before”\n\nThe BBC did create an acclaimed radio adaptation of the book in 2014, but this will be the first time Good Omens has been successfully adapted for screen.\n\nDuring the panel event, Gaiman also revealed why he had agreed to an exclusive deal with US company Amazon.\n\n“It mostly has to do with having worked with Amazon almost accidentally for the last few years,\" he said, adding that Amazon had become a production partner on both Good Omens and the TV adaptation of his novel American Gods.\n\n\"American Gods was with [US broadcaster] Starz but Amazon swept in and said, ‘We’ll just have the rest of the world’,\" he said, referring to the company's international streaming rights.\n\nGaiman has signed an overall deal with Amazon Studios, which will see him produce future TV series to broadcast on streaming service Prime Video.\n\nHe said his experience working with the company on both series convinced him of the move.\n\n\"It’s been an absolute delight,\" he said at Prime Video Presents, Amazon's TV showcase in London. \"They’re smart, they’re enthusiastic. This is something you will not hear a lot, but they give really good notes. When you are working at the digital coalface just trying to hew six hours of great TV out of what you’ve spent the last year making, having people you can rely on is really good.\""
