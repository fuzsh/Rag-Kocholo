        "text": "EOSCON 4.0: Lighting Out for the Territory\n\nTerry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman\n\nModerator2: Neil, can you type to the screen?\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Yes, lets begin.\n\nModerator2: Hi everyone, welcome to EOSCON 4.0. I'm your Moderator for SCIFI. This hour we're chatting with writers Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\n\nModerator2: Neil Gaiman, author of the forthcoming American Gods (publication date: June 19, 2001), the creator and author of the acclaimed Sandman series of graphic novels, is the winner of four Eisner Awards and a World Fantasy Award. His previous books include Neverwhere (made into a BBC series), Stardust and Smoke and Mirrors. He is also co-author with Terry Pratchett of the longtime cult favorite, Good Omens and the author of a children's book, The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish.\n\nModerator2: The topic is Lighting Out For The Territory\n\nModerator2: If you'd like to know more about our panelists visit our panelists page at: http://www.scifi.com/eoscon/authors.html\n\nModerator2: Brief word about the drill - please send your questions for our panelists to me, Moderator2, as private messages. (To send a private message, either double-click on my name or type \"/msg Moderator2\" on the command line - only without the quotes.)\n\nModerator2: FIRST QUESTION\n\nModerator2: What was the transition like for you when you moved from Graphic novels to more conventional novels?\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I started out writing prose books.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: The first 3 books I wrote were prose.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And then, during the year that I wrote the beginning of the second year of Sandman and Books of Magic\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I also wrote Good Omens with Terry Pratchett.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And that was in 1989.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: However, there was certainly\n\nNeil-Gaiman: a transition. American Gods, my new novel, is the first novel I've written that wasn't something else to begin with.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Good Omens was a collaboration. Neverwhere was based on the UK TV series I wrote.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And Stardust was originally illustrated.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: So, American Gods felt very much like my first solo novel in some ways.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga.\n\nModerator2: Several people have asked how long you and Terry and have known each other, and how you met?\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Terry and I met in 1984, I think.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: When a young journalist wearing a hat interviewed an author, and it was Terry's first interview as an author...\n\nNeil-Gaiman: where somebody took him out to lunch and asked him questions. I was interviewing him for Space Voyager magazine.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: A magazine so poor, I had to take the photos of Terry after thelunch.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And we met and we got along incredibly well. And we made each other laugh.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: So that's, what, 17 years? It must be...I hadn't realized that.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga.\n\nModerator2: to : i am interested to find out some of the actors both neil & terry would pick for the good omens movie Bouncer: terry is here\n\nNeil-Gaiman: When Terry comes on he can give his answewrs. I am very very hesitant these days to cast actors in online chats.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Or even to go on the record online with actors.\n\nTerry: Er...anyone there?\n\nTerry: How about this?\n\nModerator2: Yes Terry. We can see you :)\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Because if you go on record as saying \"I would desparately like Peter Sellers to play Crowley and Aziraphale with different color hair,\" the next thing you know\n\nTerry: Sorry...it's been a long day...\n\nNeil-Gaiman: the actor's agent sees that you are saying you want them online and their price goes way up.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And I figure that Terry Gilliam has enough to worry about without me saying I want SO AND SO or George Clooney to play Crowley. [to take it two extemes]\n\nTerry: Neil knows the only one I've really wanted way Brian Denehey (sp?) for Aziraphael...\n\nTerry: Are you in a cyber cafe, Neil?\n\nModerator2: Just a reminder..We're chatting with Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\n\nModerator2: If you have a question for our panelists, please send it to me, Moderator, as a private message. . (To send a private message, either double-click on my name or type \"/msg Moderator2\" on the command line - only without the quotes.)\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga.\n\nModerator2: Next Questrion...\n\nModerator2: to : would like to know if neil and terry intend to ever do another novel together?\n\nTerry: That's what the Future is all about...\n\nTerry: You fitst, Neil...\n\nTerry: Or indeed, you first...\n\nNeil-Gaiman: We wrote Good Omens\n\nNeil-Gaiman: for fun.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: We didn't know if anyone would want ot publish it.\n\nTerry: We thought it was a holiday job..\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And it's success and popularity took us both by surprise.\n\nTerry: We said: I wonder if this'll make any money?\n\nTerry: At a signing, even today, if someone comes up to me\n\nNeil-Gaiman: If we wanted to do a sequel, publishers all over the world would get into line to offer us enormous quanitities of money\n\nTerry: with more than two books, one with be GO.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: which immediately takes the fun out of the thing, so I'd rather just leave it the way it is.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga.\n\nTerry: Although I'd quite like the money...\n\nModerator2: Next Question\n\nModerator2: to : Where do you start when you write? With a character, a concept, a setting, a plot?\n\nNeil-Gaiman: My reply could be any of the above. It depends on what the project is.\n\nTerry: In my case, about one sentence.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: You always start somewhere.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Sometimes all I know is how it ends.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: With American Gods, all I knew was how it started.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga.\n\nTerry: You don't have to start at the beginning.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Very wise.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Very true.\n\nTerry: Very trite. But that's how it goes..\n\nNeil-Gaiman: (Sometimes all; you ahve is an image.)\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga\n\nTerry: I do have one rule, though..\n\nTerry: Write the cover copy by the time you've done 10,000 words\n\nTerry: Because if you don't know what the book is about by then\n\nTerry: ...you'lll never know.\n\nModerator2: Next Question\n\nTerry: So I write the blurb to tell myself what I'm writing.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: {And if the book doesn't suprise you by the end, it's not a real book.)\n\nModerator2: Oops..\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I'm ready for the next Q whenever Terry is.\n\nTerry: Can I make a brief statement, please?\n\nModerator2: Please type GA at the end of an answer so I don't interrupt you. Sorry\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Go for it, Terry.\n\nModerator2: Yes, Please do, Terry\n\nTerry: I thought it was Neil throwing up...\n\nTerry: Okay. Any way that works, when you're writing a book\n\nTerry: is a way that works.\n\nTerry: Start at the beginning, end or middle...it doesn't matter.\n\nTerry: Sometimes I'm working on three areas of the story at the same time.\n\nTerry: er..ga!\n\nModerator2: Question for Neil\n\nModerator2: to : question: my friends and i live near northampton and we were wondering which restaurant it was you sat outside being comforted by the friendly crazy person?\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I assume you're not talking about the one in Mass. butin the English midlands.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Sooner or later you will see Alan Moore wandering the streets of Northampton like Santa Claus's demonic younger brother.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And you should go up to him and ask, and he will either tell you or put a curse on you.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And either way your day will become more interesting.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga\n\nModerator2: Next Question...Several people have asked this one...\n\nModerator2: Neil and Terry, how log long does it take for you to write a book? In average?\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Terry, you go first.\n\nTerry: Er...being alive for 50 years, and then about five or six months\n\nTerry: ...of actual writing.\n\nTerry: ga\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Good Omens took us nine weeks.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Neverwhere took about three months.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Stardust took six months.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And American Gods took a hair under two years.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And the novel that comes out next year, which is called Coraline, took about eight years.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: So, I imagine the one after that will probably take about 20.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I'm obviously getting slower./\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga\n\nModerator2: STATION IDENTIFICATION:\n\nModerator2: Just a reminder..We're chatting with Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\n\nModerator2: If you have a question for our panelists, please send it to me, Moderator, as a private message. . (To send a private message, either double-click on my name or type \"/msg Moderator2\" on the command line - only without the quotes.)\n\nModerator2: Next Question\n\nTerry: Yeah, but GO also took us years of research that we didn't know we were doing...the time is takes to *write * the words is only one part of the whoe business, as Neil says.\n\nTerry: ga\n\nModerator2: to : Question for both: You both write, and both travel � how do you keep the travel from eating the writing? Or are you just both enormously energetic?\n\nNeil-Gaiman: (yes)\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Being places is really interesting.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Traveling can be immensely boring and is a great time to write. I write a lot on planes and trains, and sometiems boats.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Also, travel give you stuff that you can write about later.\n\nTerry: You can make time expand. But it is quite stressfu;\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Terry wouldn't have written The Last Continent if he hadn't been in the habit of visiting Australia.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I did a lot of American travel which fed into American Gods.\n\nTerry: However, airport strips look pretty much the same wherever you go...\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Yes.\n\nTerry: I've been to lots of places without every really seeing them...\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga\n\nTerry: ga\n\nModerator2: Next Question\n\nModerator2: to : What writer or kind of writing to you find now draws you the most?\n\nTerry: These days, I am mostly reading history.\n\nTerry: I find I read less and less fiction every year.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I spent 2 years on American Gods reading no fiction at all, just books of myth and books of history.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: So I'm trying to catch up on my fiction reading currently.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: But, for a writer, fiction gives you very little you can steal from.\n\nTerry: Whereas you can open an old history book and � bingo!\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Whereas reference books give you huge huge unmined fields to go and explore.\n\nTerry: And no one else reads them now, except us...\n\nNeil-Gaiman: ga\n\nTerry: ga\n\nModerator2: Next Question\n\nModerator2: to : Terry, what do you think about the American covers to your books? I for one would rather have the UK covers......\n\nTerry: Yeah, me to. However, the sales have shot up at around the same time that the covers changed.\n\nTerry: Go figure. It might be coincidence, but do I want to find out?\n\nTerry: I gues that's goodbye...ga\n\nModerator2: Our time is about up, so this is the final question. Thanks for being such great guests! ...What was it like working on Snow Glass Apples, a Seeing Ear Theater piece for SCIFI\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I love doing the SCIFI.COM Seeing Ear Theatre plays.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: (www.scifi.com/set)\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Brian Smith is a great director and we got Brian Dennehy for Murder Mysteries, but I was even more thrilled to have\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Bebe Neuwirth play the Queen in Snow Glass Apples which I'm told will go online in May\n\nNeil-Gaiman: It was quite chillling and all of the actors came up to me and seemed rather scared, actcually.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: They assured me I was a very sick man.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: To which I told them it was just a retelling of a famous fairy story.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I'm looking forward to hearing it when it goes online.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I think we have time for one more question.\n\nTerry: He *is* a very nice man...\n\nModerator: We have switched moderators in mid-stream...\n\nModerator: So please send your FINAL question to me now!\n\nModerator: Aha!\n\nModerator: to : How much do you keep in touch nowadays? Do you for example give each other christmas presents?\n\nModerator: And the all-important follow-up:\n\nNeil-Gaiman: (Some slightly more coherent thoughts of mine can be found on the AmericanGods.com journal page.)\n\nModerator: WHAT do you give each other for Christmas???\n\nTerry: No, we tell one another about interesting books...\n\nTerry: ...although I recently gave neil a bonsai mountain and he sent me a skeletal Elvis...\n\nNeil-Gaiman: He lies. I gave him 69 Love Songs by the Magnetic Fields last Christmas.\n\nTerry: A great album...influenced both of us, I think.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Yep.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: And I think that's it for both of us.\n\nTerry: Seems like it...\n\nModerator: I'm sure the skeletal Elvis exerted its own strange influence as well!\n\nNeil-Gaiman: I send best Jet Lag wished to the world and I'm going off to see Dawn French's Bottom.\n\nNeil-Gaiman: Thanks to Terry and everyone for joining in.\n\nModerator: Terry, Neil -- thank you so VERY much for joining us here today.\n\nTerry: Yes, they say in the paper it's a good Bottom...\n\nTerry: Cheers...ga!\n\nModerator: Dawn French's bottom leads to thought's of the crack of dawn...\n\nModerator: Everyone in the audience -- thanks for your wonderful questions!\n\nModerator: We're sorry wwe didn't have time to submit them all.\n\nModerator: Please stay with us because we have a wonderful chat event for you in this next hour where Kristine Smith and Susan Matthews talk about non-tradional military forms as viewed through the SF lens.\n\nModerator: I'm going to make the room UNmoderated for five minutes.\n\nModerator: Hold on to yr hats..."
