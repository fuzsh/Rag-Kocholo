        "text": "Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman is probably my favourite book, and one of very few I‚Äôve read multiple times. This is how Wikipedia summarises it:\n\nGood Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (1990) is a World Fantasy Award-nominated novel, written as a collaboration between the English authors Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. The book is a comedy about the birth of the son of Satan, and the coming of the End Times. There are attempts by the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley to sabotage the coming of the end times, having grown accustomed to their comfortable surroundings in England. One subplot features a mixup at the small country hospital on the day of birth and the growth of the Antichrist, Adam, who grows up with the wrong family, in the wrong country village. Another subplot concerns the summoning of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, each a big personality in their own right.\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming series, which I am incredibly excited about, I‚Äôve been re-reading it for the fourth or fifth time. In the process came across a short excerpt which can stand alone and decided it would make a good lesson for my Proficiency/C2 students. I think it could work for C1 students too.\n\nWe used it over two 90-minute lessons, but it‚Äôs very flexible so you can make it longer or shorter as you choose ‚Äì it depends on how into the tasks the students get!\n\nIf you teach a 121 student, you may choose not to read the extract yourself beforehand, and go through the lesson making predictions, producing your own version of the text and reading it for the first time at the same time as your student. I promise there‚Äôs nothing offensive there! üôÇ A couple of teachers from our school who had never read Good Omens themselves used this plan successfully with their 121 students in this way.\n\nLesson stages\n\nTell students they‚Äôre going to read a short excerpt from a book. Before they read, they‚Äôre going to predict what happens. Emphasise that there are no right answers to this.\n\nShow the pictures from Slide 1 of the Newt meets aliens Good Omens p203-205 presentation. Students work in pairs to make predictions of general events that might happen in the excerpt. Switch pairs to compare predictions and/or elicit some ideas as a class.\n\nShow the word cloud from Slide 2. Tell students that this is a word cloud showing all of the language from the original excerpt. A word that is larger appears more often in the original text. Newt is the name of one of the characters from the book, and Lower Tadfield is the village he is travelling towards.\n\nStudents work in groups of three to write a version of what they think happens in the excerpt. They can use any of the language they want to from the word cloud. Give them plenty of time to do this: 20-30 minutes would be ideal. This is a chance for them to be creative, and to check language they‚Äôre not sure about in the dictionary or with you. Again, emphasise that the aim is not to reproduce the original extract, but to play with the language and experiment with ideas.\n\nGroups read all of the other stories. Have they come up with similar ideas?\n\nSlide 3 shows two covers for the book. Tell students that the excerpt they‚Äôve been working with is from a comedy written about the end of the world. This part is a small event that happens half-way through the book. ‚ÄúWould you like to read it?‚Äù Hopefully their interest has been piqued by now and the answer will be yes!\n\nGive them the Word document (Newt meets aliens Good Omens p203-205). As they read, they should compare the events in their versions of the story to the original, and decide how similar they are. They shouldn‚Äôt worry about language they don‚Äôt understand. They‚Äôll need about 4-5 minutes to read, then should discuss in their groups the similarities and differences between their versions and the excerpt.\n\nSlide 4 has follow-up questions for students to discuss in small groups. This is a great chance to work with emergent language that students are producing.\n\nThis excerpt is incredibly rich linguistically, as is anything written by Gaiman or Pratchett. Slide 5 gives students the chance to mine the text for any language that might interest them (see ‚Äòlanguage to mine‚Äô below). They should take the lead in deciding what they want to steal.\n\nStudents then return to their original writing and write a new version of it. They can insert phrases directly lifted from Good Omens, or simply be inspired by the variety and richness of the original excerpt to make their own text richer through the use of synonyms, similes, and highly descriptive language.\n\nThey then share their original and rewritten texts (side by side) with other groups and answer the question: ‚ÄòWhat difference does the writer‚Äôs choice of language make to the enjoyment of the reader?‚Äô\n\nAs an optional extension, students could role play the situation of Newt meeting the aliens, or of Newt/the aliens telling somebody else what happened a few hours later. This would give them the chance to reuse some of the language they stole from the text.\n\nTo finish the lesson, show students the trailer for the upcoming series and ask them if they want to watch it. Slide 6 has the video embedded; slide 7 has the link in case it doesn‚Äôt work.\n\nWhat happened in my lesson?\n\nI only had three students out of a possible six, so my pair and share activity didn‚Äôt work when they wrote their own texts. They were surprised that the text they produced had the same broad strokes as the excerpt.\n\nAlthough we used two lessons, we didn‚Äôt have time to go back to the writing and upgrade it, which would have been valuable. I felt like adding a third lesson to do this would have been dragging it out too much though.\n\nStudents were engaged in mining the text, and said they would like to try this with other texts in the future. We looked at the language of officialdom and how it was used to create humour in this excerpt.\n\nOne student had already read Good Omens before I introduced it, and went back and re-read it in Polish between the two lessons üôÇ [Here‚Äôs an Amazon affiliate link if you want to get your own copy.]\n\nLanguage to mine from the text\n\nThis is very much NOT an exhaustive list of examples of language that could be taken from the excerpt. Any of these could be used by students to create new texts as a follow-up (for example a description of a crazy car journey), or could be used as a language focus if you want something more targeted than the word cloud from slide 2.\n\nPhrases and phrasal verbs:\n\nfall over\n\nwind (the window) down\n\nthink of (sth) (as sth else)\n\nwander off\n\nrun sth through a machine\n\n(let sth) build up\n\nlet yourself go\n\nsee to sth\n\nturn sth over in his mind\n\nturn around\n\nbawl sb out\n\nFeatures of spoken grammar:\n\nan‚Äô suchlike\n\none of them phenomena\n\nBeen‚Ä¶, haven‚Äôt we sir?\n\nBeen‚Ä¶perhaps?\n\nWell, yes. I suppose so.\n\nI‚Äôll see to it. Well, when I say I‚Ä¶\n\nWe‚Äôd better be going.\n\nYou do know‚Ä¶don‚Äôt you?\n\nWays of describing speaking:\n\ngabbled\n\nflailed\n\nrasped\n\nWays of describing movement:\n\na door in the saucer slid aside\n\nskidded down it and fell over at the bottom\n\nwalked over to the car quite slowly\n\nDescriptive phrases for a spaceship and aliens:\n\nsatisfying whoosh\n\ngleaming walkway\n\nIt looked like every cartoon of a flying saucer Newt had ever seen.\n\nBrilliant blue light\n\nfrantic beeping\n\nConnected to cars:\n\nHe had the map spread over the steering wheel.\n\nHe had to brake hard.\n\nrapped on the window\n\nHe wound it down.\n\nHe drove up on the verge and around it.\n\nWhen he looked in his rearview mirror‚Ä¶\n\nConnected to officialdom:\n\nin the worldwide approved manner of policemen already compiling the charge sheet in their heads\n\nWell, I‚Äôm sorry to have to tell you, sir‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶are below regulation size for a [planet] of this category, sir.\n\nWe‚Äôll overlook it on this occasion, sir.\n\nA little bit of theory\n\nThis is a task-based lesson, with the focus on meaning early in the lesson. For the initial task, students have to use their own linguistic resources to come up with an episode in a story, and they are free to go in whatever direction they choose. They have the scaffolding of the pictures and the word cloud, but are not required to use any particular language point. Sharing their texts is the report phase, and they then see a model which they can mine for language. This language can then be incorporated into their own work ‚Äì it is student-led, with them choosing the language they focus on, rather than following the teacher‚Äôs agenda of what ‚Äòshould‚Äô be learnt next. This task repetition and upgrade stage is where a lot of the learning will happen, as students experiment with the language. There is then another report phase, with reflection on language use in general (writer choices), not just the specific language used in this lesson.\n\nThe language I‚Äôve pulled out above reflects principles of the lexical approach (I hope!), working with longer chunks of language rather than isolated words. Collocations can be explored, as well as areas like features of spoken language. This can help students to move away from a focus on single words and verb tenses plus other structures typically appearing as part of a course book syllabus, which they often still have even at proficiency level.\n\nTeaching students how to mine a text in this way can also be useful for their own self-study, thus developing learner autonomy. Techniques like this can be challenging for students to incorporate into their own learning without being shown how to do it the first couple of times.\n\nMore of this kind of thing"
