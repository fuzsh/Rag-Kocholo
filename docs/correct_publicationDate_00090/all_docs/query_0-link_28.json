        "text": "Synopsis: Aziraphale and Crowley – an angel of heaven and a demon from hell respectively – have an Agreement. Their agreement – and their days of comfort on Earth – are threatened by the upcoming Apocalypse, to be started by Adam Young, Antichrist, Professional Daydreamer, and Leader of the Them.\n\nI picked up Good Omens after I’d already watched and loved the show (ft. Michael Sheen as Aziraphale and David Tennant as Crowley). As a long time fan of both these authors and their books, I was fully prepared to love it.\n\nAs soon as the car had stopped he had the back door open and was bowing like an aged retainer welcoming the young massa back to the old plantation.\n\nThen I put it down again, feeling a little queasy.\n\nI’m not sure what it is – whether it’s the high hopes I had or the fact that nothing in Terry Pratchett’s writing has ever struck me as problematic. (I’ve read all 41 books in the Discworld series 3 times each).\n\nBut things like the casually racist quote above, the throwaway mention of rape in a joke, and Crowley dressed as a woman being generalised as a comparison to trans sex workers (the phrasing gives the impression that trans women exist solely as sex workers) – they’ve all stuck in my craw, and the irritation isn’t going away.\n\nComing to what works – the humour works. The wonderful relationship between Crowley and Aziraphale works. The jabs at any form of organised religion work. The philosophical insights into humanity work.\n\nAnathema Device, Newton Pulsifer and the shenanigans of the rest of their gang… those all work very well too.\n\nGood Omens is also imagination run riot in the most enjoyable and humorous way – twisting the literal into the metaphorical and vice versa.\n\nWhere you found the real McCoy, the real grace and the real heart-stopping evil, was right inside the human mind.\n\nAbove all, what works is Adam Young. Good Omens is on the underside of the spectrum typically populated by great works such as Omen and Rosemary’s Baby. And as such, it serves as a cleanser for the decades of satanist nonsense that has permeated our cultural palate.\n\nThree stars for being a great book that was ruined by a few unwise turns of phrase."
