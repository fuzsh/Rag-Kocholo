        "text": "Sir Terry Pratchett passed away yesterday at the age of 66 from complications from Alzheimer’s. His death was announced on Twitter in a funny and touching and altogether perfect way, and all day and continuing through this morning, tributes both hilarious and poignant have shown up in every place where people with words gather to read and write words.\n\nElyse had to tell her husband, who is a huge Pratchett fan, and says it was terribly difficult to break the news to him. Pratchett means so much to so many.\n\nElyse: I felt sick when I called my husband to tell him that Terry Pratchett had died. Normally I’m not particularly affected by the deaths of people I don’t personally know, but there’s a special sort of sadness that comes when you lose a much beloved author. Maybe it’s because authors impact me in a way that actors and musicians don’t or maybe it was just the hours I spent in Discworld or maybe it was the way his passing was so perfectly announced on Twitter, but I cried a little when I called my husband.\n\nWhen an author leaves us, they take their magic with him, and that can be especially hard to bear. I have the utmost sympathy for Pratchett’s family and friends who were with him during his battle with Alzheimer’s, but I feel too for all the readers who are feeling bereft. Pratchett touched so many lives with humor and warmth, mine among them. He was the best sort of satirist–his fantasy world, Discworld, was a mirror of our own, reflecting absurdities and injustices, but his writing was never caustic or cruel. The beauty of his humor was it’s warmth, it’s humanity and it’s delight in the ridiculous.\n\nEven as I’ll miss Pratchett, I’ll miss all the characters he introduced me to: Death (WHO ALWAYS SPOKE IN ALL CAPITALS), Sam Vimes, Granny Weatherwax, The Luggage, Carrot, The Librarian, and Cut Me Own Throat Dibbler. I’ll never forget that Pratchett coined L-Space, which I am 100% convinced exists.\n\nI sincerely hope that if you loved Terry Pratchett, you find some comfort reading this weekend. If you’ve never read him, then I can’t recommend him strongly enough. I personally loved the City Watch series, starting with Guards! Guards! My husband recommends you start with Mort.\n\nI owe many many hours of laughter to Sir Terry, the kind of laughter that makes you wheeze, and tinkle, and wake up the cat. I can’t think of a better legacy to leave behind than laughter and a little incontinence. Goodbye Terry, you will be missed.\n\nSarah: The tributes I’ve seen online are powerful in unique ways. From XKCD:\n\nMeka on Twitter told me that long ago, she used to play a Discworld mud: “an online text-based rpg and yesterday, lots of us old players logged in just to share, just to be around one another, just to talk.” His books were her entrance to the Discworld mudding community, where she made friends that are still connected to her today, years after she first logged on.\n\nThe way readers connect over books, over shared experiences in shared worlds in text, is a wonderful and powerful thing. You can see pieces of that connection in all the tributes to Pratchett, whose world was one where many, many readers lost and found themselves repeatedly. This JustGiving page in memory of Pratchett is collecting donations for RICE, The Research Institute for the Care of Older People, a British charity based in Bath which provides services and support for those living with dementia. The tributes are for Pratchett, and for the readers who loved his books. One in particular said, “In memory of my Father, David, who loved reading Mr Pratchett’s books.”\n\nThe shared world of reading creates a unique and innately positive bond between people, I think. As I said on Twitter, I think the common love we share for a book, a world, or an author’s collective work is one of the best things about humanity. It’s beautiful that we can do that. When an author publishes a story, that story creates a chance for readers to connect over a shared world. It’s a gift to every person who may read those words. Each book is a potential connection.\n\nThe loss of the creator of that connection hurts, especially for those who spent so much time in the created world- as the XKCD comic illustrates. I know Carrie, who reviewed Hogfather and talked about how she reads it annually, is grieving Pratchett’s death deeply. Hogfather and the Discworld series were part of a personal ritual for her:\n\nFor me, though, the real draw of the particular book is that it reminds me of things that I need to be reminded of. It reminds me that life is not fair but it bloody well should be. It reminds me that fantasy is vital to humanity. It reminds me that regardless of one’s religious beliefs, and mine seem to change approximately once every five to ten years, the rebirth of the sun at winter is a glorious thing. And it doesn’t hurt to try to be a decent human being, too, especially if you can keep it up all year.\n\nCarrie also reviewed Pratchett’s September 2014 book of nonfiction essays, A Slip of the Keyboard. She wrote in her review:\n\nI happened to read this collection during a week in which my Twitter feed was flooded with bullshit. If there’s anything I adore about Terry Pratchett, it’s that he is bullshit free. Whether he’s talking about book tours, being a lackluster student, his struggles with early-onset Alzheimer’s, or orangutans, he’s forthright, funny, and unpretentious, with great tolerance for human foibles but no tolerance for injustice and stupidity. As Neil Gaiman says in the foreword, people think of Terry Pratchett as “a jolly old elf” but in fact “There is a fury to Terry Pratchett’s writing. It’s the fury that was the engine that powered Discworld.”\n\nI know many of you are feeling the same loss, the grief at the absence of the person who gave you a world that you love. I’m so sorry for that loss. For those of us who have not read a Pratchett book (hi there!), where should we start, to enter the world that you love? What’s your favorite? What book have you reached for first?"
