        "text": "This weekend I realized that each of the books I was reading was stolen from a different family member. We keep things in circulation around here, let me say.\n\nGood Omens was the providence of my sister Mary, who took a pretty long walk to a bookstore one day to buy it and has been urging me to read it ever since. The spine was cracked in at least seven places, and if I recall correctly she actually ran out once and bought a highlighter with the sole intention of picking out relevant passages. (“It is said that the Devil has all the best tunes. This is broadly true. But Heaven has the best choreographers.”) It was with some amusement that I read the Gaiman/Pratchett-penned intro and outro about signing copes of Good Omens that had been taped back together or fallen in the bath. I guess a certain type of book inspires a certain type of readerly behavior.\n\nIt’s funny, then, that this book is a take on Christianity. I’m pretty sure every author gets around to a take on Christianity sooner or later. John Steinbeck’s was East of Eden, in which he proclaimed, “Nothing was ever created by two men. There are no good collaborations,” which would seem to spell doom for operation Gaiman-Pratchett, except that, no, the thing’s a cult classic that gets read in bathtubs everywhere. How did they pull it off? Phone conversations and floppy discs, or so I hear.\n\nI don’t believe that there are no good collaborations, but I do believe that once you pull another author in, the work ceases to become a novel and starts to become a movie, hence all this director’s commentary in the paperback. The narrative is seamless, as Gaiman and Pratchett are quite good at imitating each other’s styles (or rather, imitating Douglas Adam), but it’s nonetheless fun to play “guess which author wrote which section”. (I congratulate myself for realizing that the “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse” sections, with that motorcycle-riding bombshell War, could have been penned by no one but Neil–although I suspect that Terry Pratchett threw in the tag-along would-be horsemen who named themselves after less-acknowledged plagues on humanity, such as Really Cool People and Things Not Working Properly After You’ve Given Them a Good Thumping.)\n\nBut I’ve been avoiding the plot, and that’s because it’s a gigantic jumble, though admittedly one more focused than anything Douglas Adams ever came up with. (That was the beauty of Douglas Adams, though–he specialized in frenetic randomness.) To hear the internet tell it you’d think this was a story about Aziraphale and Crowley, and while it does contain an angel and a demon of that name, there are nonetheless lengthy sections where you can forget they even exist. There are far more groups of characters than seem necessary, and the narrative jumps from one to the other with disorienting speed. There’s a scene where the angel Aziraphale, temporarily dispirited of his mortal body, possesses people at random in order to get his bearings, at one point aiming so far from England that he ends up on an American televangelical broadcast. That was how I felt as a reader, constantly being jolted into a new body and obliged to look through a new set of eyes. (By the way, Neil Gaiman, or Terry Pratchett, or whoever I can blame for that section, feels the need to give the possessed televangelist three pages of slyly-written backstory, only to never mention him again. That’s typical of the writing, which values easy humor opportunities over actual plot progression.)\n\nThe result is that plenty of threads with potential don’t get highlighted in the way they deserve to. For instance, the general thrust of the story concerns the reality-warping Antichrist, who was switched at birth with a normal human baby–except that, in a further mix-up, the divine and demonic forces who were supposed to keep an eye on the growing boy end up getting directed toward the wrong kid. The normal boy, christened “Warlock”, has a very confusing childhood, what with his hired nanny raising him to believe that he’s destined to destroy the Earth, not to mention St. Francis of Assisi getting himself hired as his family’s gardener and attempting to train him to value life. Meanwhile the real antichrist, Adam Young, is left alone, and, in a true triumph of nurture over nature, grows up to be, not good, not evil, but just a regular human kid, albeit with powers that can change the fate of human history. Once Adam starts discovering his powers, though, Warlock gets dropped like a hot potato. (I was personally hoping that he’d end up being the main bad guy, lack of reality-warping ability nonwithstanding.)\n\nDid I mention that all this religion-as-entertainment stuff made me prettyuncomfortable as a practicing Catholic? Look, I’m fine with a little devilish humor–that’s what The Screwtape Letters is for. But if you’re going to appropriate aspects of my belief system to make a popcorn paperback like this one, I’d appreciate some religious and/or philosophical insight into the bargain.\n\nNot to say that Gaiman and Pratchett don’t try their damnedest to drum some up. They play angels vs. demons as a separation of political parties, neither one inherently good or evil–just “names for sides”, sides which Man essentially invented by his mere existence. This ties into their hypothesis that supernatural forces actually have little or no influence over Man, who is at once capable of more evil than Hell can imagine and more good than Heaven can comprehend. Angels and demons, when you get right down to it, are kind of lame, minions sent to earth to urge humanity down one path or the other; Crowley’s fellow demons spend years focusing on individual souls a la Screwtape and Wormwood, but Crowley, wiser and more apathetic, has a hard time dreaming up anything worse to do to humans than what humans will do to themselves."
