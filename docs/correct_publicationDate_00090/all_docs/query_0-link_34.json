        "text": "A brand-new full-cast audiobook production of the classic collaboration from internationally best-selling authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett starring Rebecca Front as the Narrator, Michael Sheen as Aziraphale, and David Tennant as Crowley!\n\n\"Good Omens...is something like what would have happened if Thomas Pynchon, Tom Robbins and Don DeLillo had collaborated. Lots of literary inventiveness in the plotting and chunks of very good writing and characterization. Itâ€™s a wow. It would make one hell of a movie. Or a heavenly one. Take your pick.\" (Washington Post)\n\nAccording to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (the world's only completely accurate book of prophecies, written in 1655, before she exploded), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. Just before dinner.\n\nSo the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon - both of whom have lived amongst Earth's mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyle - are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture.\n\nAnd someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist....\n\nDonâ€™t miss Season 2 of the Prime original series!\n\nDramatis personae:\n\nSupernatural Beings\n\nRebecca Front: Narrator\n\nMichael Sheen: Aziraphale\n\nDavid Tennant: Crowley\n\nHumans\n\nKatherine Kingsley: Anathema Device\n\nArthur Darvill: Newton Pulsifer\n\nPeter Forbes: Shadwell\n\nGabrielle Glaister: Madame Tracy and Agnes Nutter\n\nThem\n\nLouis Davison: Adam\n\nPixie Davies: Pepper\n\nChris Nelson: Wensleydale\n\nFerdinand Frisby Williams: Brian\n\nEnsemble"
