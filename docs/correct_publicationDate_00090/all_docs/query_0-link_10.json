        "text": "October 2020: Good Omens\n\nGood Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch by Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman is a novel written as a collaboration between the English authors Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. “There is a distinct hint of Armageddon in the air. According to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (recorded, thankfully, in 1655, before she blew up her entire village and all its inhabitants, who had gathered to watch her burn), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road, and the world’s last two remaining witch-finders are getting ready to fight the good fight, armed with awkwardly antiquated instructions and stick pins. Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. . . . Right. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon — each of whom has lived among Earth’s mortals for many millennia and has grown rather fond of the lifestyle — are not particularly looking forward to the coming Rapture. If Crowley and Aziraphale are going to stop it from happening, they’ve got to find and kill the Antichrist (which is a shame, as he’s a really nice kid). There’s just one glitch: someone seems to have misplaced him…” Meeting: https://mit.zoom.us/j/96532875591 6:00pm – 7:00pm The Literary Society is a student-run organization sponsored by the Literature Section. The MIT Literary Society creates a comfortable atmosphere for undergraduates to freely discuss their book interests. We read one book every month and meet every Tuesday – twice a month for book discussions, and twice a month for silent sustained reading (SSR) meetings. The group votes on book selections, choosing from genres that range from the classics to contemporary works. All members get to lead a part of each discussion. Other events may include guest speakers from MIT’s faculty and viewings of movies based on books. Our Mission: Founded in the spring of 2006, the MIT Literary Society is an undergraduate reading group that focuses on literary discussion outside of the classroom. The purpose of the MIT Literary Society is to complement the often rigorous and technical MIT education by creating a forum that encourages discussions on the current literary climate. The group is designed to encourage the exploration of various genres and interpretations, and also to develop one’s leadership skills by coordinating discussions.
