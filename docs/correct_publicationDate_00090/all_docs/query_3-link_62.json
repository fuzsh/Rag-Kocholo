        "text": "in the original version Aziraphale must have involved heaven, to get St Francis to join in the attempted conversion of the antichrist to good, and this was the implication - right? And the nanny was sent by hell to make sure the antichrist followed his true destiny - yes? But then at the end the Metatron was quite clear that armageddon was going ahead no matter what (same as in the TV version), so why bother trying to convert the antichrist?\n\nGaiman has said that interpretations are head-canon, and he's all for it.\n\nAs I vaguely understand it, saints were human beings, unlike angels. They may appear at times, both to groups and to individuals, to inspire. I don't recall ever hearing that they had to get permission, so heaven doesn't necessarily pay close attention. Aziraphale was still an angel, so maybe (in the book) he went directly to St Francis and asked him to intercede for the sake of this one boy who was at risk. Heaven seems like a pretty boring place, so maybe St Francis was eager to help out. What's eleven years out of eternity, anyway?\n\nI don't have a clue about any details of hellish bureaucracy beyond Dante and a few Chinese fairy tales, but presumably something similar goes on. Nobody checks up on the accuracy of Crowley's reports, they just take his word for it. So maybe he hinted to Ashtoreth that she could get a few points with the boss by advising the offspring. Or maybe she was always going to be sent, once Crowley had made the delivery.\n\nStill, I prefer the version in the TV series.\n\nThis whole thread is all spoilers, right?\n\nDemonic fashion statements.\n\nSupposedly the demons look like that because of the old canard about evil being ugly by nature. But in Good Omens, it varies. Beelzebub's facial goop isn't the same at all times. There's more of it in, I think, the trial scene when they're being official, and there' s none at all visible when they rise to confront Crowley at the airfield and deal with Gabriel. So it's controllable, and that makes it a fashion statement among demons.\n\nDemons seem to want to have something that marks them as non-ordinary even when taking humanoid form. (It may even be a privilege.) Crowley has a snake tattoo, and snake eyes which he covers with sunglasses.\n\nOnce they are invented, Crowley wears sunglasses supposedly to help disguise himself as human, but he doesn't need to. He was able to make people just not notice his eyes during the previous millennia. Both Aziraphale and Crowley do the \"Don't Notice Me\" thing while walking through the wreckage at the paintball riot. (That's also the trope of walking through a mess and not getting dirty.) It's just easier to wear the sunglasses, but that's not the real reason. For the first few hundred years sunglasses were a sign of wealth and privilege (I think Nero's were made of emeralds), and a thousand years later they still indicated coolness.\n\nCrowley doesn't have to have snake eyes, either. If he did, he could never have passed for Aziraphale in Heaven. Similarly, Aziraphale had to manifest snake eyes in his visit to Hell.\n\nThat means that the snake eyes, as well as the sunglasses, are like the fake bullet-hole decals on the Bentley windows. Crowley wears them because he thinks they're cool.\n\nAngelic fashion statements? Or marks of corruption?\n\nWe saw three angels bully Aziraphale, beating him on a street corner. They were Michael, Uriel, and Sandalphon.\n\nI believe it was after we saw the darker side of the angelic bullies that I noticed that Uriel was wearing what apparently is an odd bit of makeup in Heaven, that didn't show on Earth. There are spots of lighter color slightly diagonally across Uriel's face, and other patches on the cheekbones, etc. They look almost pink. Since they don't show all the time, but they are definitely not a reflection or other trick of the light, they may be some kind of deliberate facial decoration.\n\nI feel that this is precisely parallel to the demonic sores and other goopy-looking stuff on demons' faces, especially Beelzebub's, which vary according to the audience. (Beelzebub's didn't show at all in the scene at the airfield.)\n\nWhen Michael is making that private telephone call to someone Below, there is a peculiar smudge on their right cheekbone. In one view it's just a small smudge, in another it seemed larger. Since I doubt that the makeup crew of the production company would have allowed an accidental smudge to get past them, it must be meaningful. But it doesn't look pretty, like Uriel's decoration. It looks like the beginnings of something that might become rather unfortunate looking. With that in mind, even Uriel's seems a bit off.\n\nI begin to wonder whether both Uriel and Michael are beginning to show their own corruption.\n\nWhen Michael finked on Aziraphale and showed Gabriel the photos of Aziraphale with Crowley, Gabriel did allow for the possibility that there was a reasonable explanation. Gabriel doesn't show any blemishes, but it was in that scene that I first noticed Michael's. Gabriel wasn't in on the bullying session on that street corner, but both Michael and Uriel were. I haven't noticed a major blemish on the third bully, Sandalphon, yet, but I'll have to try to look at that scene again. I think it's possible that Sandalphon didn't actually hit Aziraphale. If so, then he may not be actually corrupt, just misguided.\n\nETA: I found a clip of it on a music video. it looks like it's Sandalphon and Uriel who hit Aziraphale, then Uriel shoves him against the wall. I'm not sure if Michael just stands there smirking or joins in.\n\nIt's been many years since I read the book, and I remember very little about the plot, so my reactions are solely about the TV series itself. And since Gaiman himself wrote all the episodes, I'm looking at this from more of a writer's view and an overall series impression.\n\nThe best parts were the scenes between Tennant and Sheen, and to me they seem like the scenes where Gaiman spent most of this energy (and had most of his fun). Now, how much of the dialogue comes from the books (and therefore how much of it might have been Pterry's original lines) I don't know. But these scenes work wonderfully. I find that the series often drags when neither A or C is in a scene.\n\nMy only complaint about Sheen is that at times he seems to be imitating Anthony Daniels voicing of C3PO in the Star Wars movies, especially when he takes over the body of Madame Tracey.\n\nAnd while I always enjoy seeing Michael McKean in a series, I think his portrayal of Shadwell was a bit over the top--too much of the deer in headlights at times.\n\nI also thought that John Hamm was perfectly cast as Gabriel, the epitome of a soulless bureaucrat. And it's always nice to see Bill Paterson doing his cranky old man thing.\n\nBut I found the rest of the actors to be not so engaging. The actors playing Anathema and Pulsifer were just dull and their storyline was dull. I do kind of wonder why they were in the book in the first place other than to add youthful love story appeal for those not interested in the ageless, loveless mythical characters. Gaiman's lines for them are not particularly witty, and their role seems to mainly expositional, i.e., \"Agnes predicted all this, and our role is to do something important.\" And, really, in the end, all they do is stop the missiles from launching (well, Pulsifer, actually). Theoretically, Adam could have done this as well.\n\nI also found all of the kid actors, particularly the one playing Adam, to be rather dull. The fact that Adam needed to have colorized red eyes to \"be evil\" points out that he wasn't able to carry off the \"lapse into evil\" thing through acting alone. The other kid actors didn't venture far beyond stereotype.\n\nAnd the the four bikers were just so disappointing. Maybe because Pterry did so much of a better job bringing them to, er, life in Thief of Time that their portrayal in the show seems so uncompelling. Death in particular looked like a bad Halloween costume and David Cox's voicing was horrible--couldn't Stephen Briggs or Nigel Planer have done the voiceovers?\n\nOverall, I thought the series was pretty good and very entertaining at its best parts, but I think Gaiman would have benefited by having a more seasoned TV writer co-writing the scripts with him to sharpen up some of the duller areas. At least the show is a much better adaptation of a Gaiman novel than the harrowing, nearly unwatchable mess American Gods turned into in its second season."
