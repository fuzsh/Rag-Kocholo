        "text": "GOOD OMENS\n\nThe nice and accurate prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch\n\nBy Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett\n\nPublisher: HarperTorch; Reprint edition (November 28, 2006)\n\nISBN-13: 978-0060853983\n\nGenre: Science Fiction/Fantasy\n\nThere is a distinct hint of Armageddon in the air. According to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch(recorded, thankfully, in 1655, before she blew up her entire village and all its inhabitants, who had gathered to watch her burn), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse are revving up their mighty hogs and hitting the road, and the world’s last two remaining witch-finders are getting ready to fight the good fight, armed with awkwardly antiquated instructions and stick pins. Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. . . . Right. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan.\n\nExcept that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon — each of whom has lived among Earth’s mortals for many millennia and has grown rather fond of the lifestyle — are not particularly looking forward to the coming Rapture. If Crowley and Aziraphale are going to stop it from happening, they’ve got to find and kill the Antichrist (which is a shame, as he’s a really nice kid). There’s just one glitch: someone seems to have misplaced him. . . .\n\nFirst published in 1990, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s brilliantly dark and screamingly funny take on humankind’s final judgment is back — and just in time — in a new hardcover edition (which includes an introduction by the authors, comments by each about the other, and answers to some still-burning questions about their wildly popular collaborative effort) that the devout and the damned alike will surely cherish until the end of all things.\n\nAvailable from Amazon and B&N\n\nA TACO REVIEW\n\nHello my pretties! It feels good to be back with my fellow bookworms. This week I bring Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Last year I professed my undying love of anything written by Mr. Gaiman and I had read many a good things about Good Omens, hence why I took my happy bibliophile self to my local library (libraries are like Netflix but for books!) to pick it up. It took a couple of tries but I made it through and got some good laughs along the way.\n\nThe way this book was written jumps from one character to another and it made it-not difficult but interesting- keeping up with everyone’s timeline. The characters are so funny, in that dry British kind of way and made me snort more often than not. The gist of the book is bringing upon the end of the world via the Antichrist. Heaven and Hell trying to out do one another to make sure that their side influenced the kid more than the other in order to win the final battle of Good Vs Evil. The twist is that they kind of lost the Antichrist when he was born and have been influencing the wrong child.\n\nThere are so many great characters in this book that I cannot pick a favorite. I especially love the relationship between Aziraphale and Crowley, who are supposed to be sworn enemies since they work for opposing teams but are undercover besties. They bicker like an old married couple, which is understandable since they’ve known each other since before the dawn of time. Then you have the Four Bikers of the Apocalypse, my favorite being Death. He’s so aloof about the whole thing, it’s great. Death seems to only be there because he has to be there not because he wants to. You also have Them, the ragtag team of the Antichrist, they consist of three boys(including the Antichrist AKA Adam), a girl and a hellhound named Dog. Like I said there are a lot of characters and all of them are splendid and wacky and such a joy to read.\n\nThere are so many things that happened that I don’t know what to share out of fear I’ll ruin it for you guys.\n\nI give this four Tacos in the Taco Scale of Awesome. Good Omens was written by two amazing authors so seamlessly you can’t tell who wrote what. It’s marvalous. There are footnotes throughout the book. Don’t skip the footnotes. They are just as hilarious as the story itself. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to see how ineffable the “Ineffable Plan” for the end of the world really is and who effs up along the way.\n\nUntil next time, Mon over and out."
