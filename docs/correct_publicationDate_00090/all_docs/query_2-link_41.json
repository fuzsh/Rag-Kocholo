        "text": "Good Omens Co-author(s) Neil Gaiman Illustrator(s) Publisher Victor Gollancz Publication date 10 May 1990 ISBN 057504800X Pages RRP Main characters Aziraphale\n\nCrowley\n\nAdam Young Series Good Omens Annotations View Notes All data relates to the first UK edition.\n\nGood Omens is a comic novel about demons, angels, prophecies and Armageddon, in which a mix-up at a hospital causes the Antichrist to be brought up as a perfectly normal kid with bizarre consequences as he develops his special talents with neither demons nor angels for guidance.\n\nTerry Gilliam would make a movie of this book if those with the money and inclination to make such a thing possible were not as rare as Klatchian Mist.\n\nBlurb\n\nAccording to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter – the world's only totally reliable guide to the future – the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. Just after tea...\n\nCharacters\n\nThe Them\n\nAdam Young\n\nBrian\n\nPepper\n\nWensleydale\n\nDemons and Angels etc.\n\nAziraphale\n\nBeelezebub\n\nCrowley\n\nHastur\n\nLigur\n\nEarl Beezlemoth\n\nThe Metatron\n\nRiders Of The Apocalypse\n\nDeath\n\nFamine\n\nPollution\n\nWar\n\nFour Other Riders Of The Apocalypse\n\nGreaser\n\nPigbog\n\nScuzz\n\nBig Ted\n\nWitchfinder Army\n\nNurker\n\nNewton Pulsifer\n\nShadwell\n\nThou-Shalt-Not-Commit-Adultery Pulsifer\n\nThe Chattering Order of St. Beryl\n\nSister Mary Loquacious\n\nAnathema Device\n\nJulia Petley\n\nMadame Tracy\n\nThe International Express Man\n\nMr. Young\n\nDeirdre Young\n\nGreasy Johnson\n\nAgnes Nutter\n\nBeryl Ormerod\n\nRon Ormerod\n\nMarjorie Potts\n\nWarlock Dowling\n\nHorace Gander\n\nDog\n\nLocations\n\nAtlantis\n\nPower Cable, Nebraska\n\nTadfield\n\nTurning Point Power Station\n\nAdditional Material\n\nThe United States edition of Good Omens had numerous alterations to the text. The most significant alteration to the main text is the addition of an extra 700-word section just before the end, dealing with what happened to the character of Warlock, the American diplomat's son, who was swapped with Adam. The American edition also adds numerous footnotes not found in British editions as well as changes to the spelling throughout so that the text corresponded to American English norms rather than British English. One howler of an error has \"Aziraphile nipping across the city of Hell\" early on. Comparing this to the British text, it appears the American editor was correcting a non-existent error, not knowing Hull is an English port city on the east coast. It may be grim, it may have had the pugnacious John Prescott as its MP and it may be in the East Riding of Yorkshire - but it isn't quite Hell...\n\nEditions since 2006 have contained extra material by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman: a new Foreword to the book, 'Good Omens, The Facts' an interview with the two authors and two articles by each author: 'Neil Gaiman On Terry Pratchett' and 'Terry Pratchett On Neil Gaiman.'\n\nCrowley & Aziraphale’s New Year’s Resolutions were released on the author's extra section on the HarperCollins website; this section no longer exists but the material can be found on Neil Gaiman's Tumbler account. This was a set of promises by the respective characters for the year ahead.\n\nIllustrations by Paul Kidby and revised text in The Definitive Good Omens.\n\nAdaptations\n\nGood Omens ASIN [1] IMDB 1869454 First Broadcast 31st May 2019 Broadcast Channel Amazon Prime, BBC Two Director(s) Douglas Mackinnon Producer(s) Neil Gaiman, Caroline Skinner, Chris Sussman, Rob Wilkins, Rod Brown Writer(s) {{{writer}}} Starring Michael Sheen, David Tennant, Sam Taylor Buck Duration 60 minutes Episodes 6 Series Good Omens Annotations Annotations for Book:Good Omens Notes Preceded by Troll Bridge Followed by ' All data relates to the UK home release.\n\nTV Series\n\nIn 2017 Neil Gaiman announced that he would be partnering his Blank Corporation with Narrativia to create a TV series adaptation.

The book was funded through the website Kickstarter with an initial goal of £25,000.\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe book satirises some aspects of the '70s movie The Omen, where an American diplomat has Damien, the Antichrist, for a child. Although Damien is dismissed as a name, and isn't the Antichrist anyway, he is raised by a supernatural nanny, and with a birthday party that gets out of hand.\n\nRight on the very last page of the book, there is a line stating:\n\n\"If you want to see the future, imagine a boot...\"\n\nPratchett and Gaiman amend \"boot\" to \"sneaker\", but the reference is clearly to the closing paragraphs of George Orwell's 1984:\n\n\"If you want to see the future, imagine a boot, stamping on a human face, forever.\"\n\nThis is softened in Good Omens to a sneaker, or trainer, with untied laces, on the foot of the Antichrist, who has just succeeded in thwarting the desire of both Heaven and Hell to stamp on the collective face of the human race until something breaks beyond repair. (What else is Armageddon, after all)\n\nGallery\n\nGood Omens on the Annotated Pratchett File\n\nThe Good Omens Lexicon"
