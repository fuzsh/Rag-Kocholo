        "text": "Ciervo Blanco Book Club organizes a book discussion in English about the novel ‘Good Omens’ by Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett\n\nThis is an in-person book discussion in English. It’s free, organized at not cost for the attendees. The only requirement is to read the book!\n\nAccording to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter – the world’s only totally reliable guide to the future – the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. Just after tea…\n\nPeople have been predicting the end of the world almost from its very beginning, so it’s only natural to be sceptical when a new date is set for Judgement Day. This time though, the armies of Good and Evil really do appear to be massing. The four Bikers of the Apocalypse are hitting the road. But both the angels and demons – well, one fast-living demon and a somewhat fussy angel – would quite like the Rapture not to happen.\n\nNeil Gaiman was born in Hampshire, UK, in 1960 and since 1992 has lived in the United States, currently residing near Minneapolis.\n\nFollowing the publication of his groundbreaking series ‘Sandman’ (1989-1996) he has become established as one of the creators of modern comics, as well as an author whose work crosses genres and reaches audiences of all ages. He is listed in the Dictionary of Literary Biography as one of the top ten living post-modern writers and is a prolific creator of works of prose, poetry, film, journalism, comics, song lyrics, and drama.\n\nGaiman is active as a television and screenwriter. He wrote the screenplay for the original BBC TV series of ‘Neverwhere’ (1996); the feature film, ‘Mirrormask’ (2005), the script to Robert Zemeckis’s ‘Beowulf.’ He has written and directed two films: ‘A Short Film About John Bolton’ (2002) and ‘Statuesque’ (2009). An animated feature film based on his book ‘Coraline,’ directed by Henry Selick and released in early 2009, secured a BAFTA for Best Animated Film and was nominated for an Oscar in the same category. His 2011 episode of Doctor Who, “The Doctor’s Wife,” caused the London Times to describe him as “a hero.”\n\nHe is also an established writer for children. His work for young readers, The Graveyard Book was published in 2008 and won the UK’s Booktrust Prize for Teenage Fiction and the Newbery Medal, the highest honor given in US children’s literature, as well as the Locus Young Adult Award and the Hugo Best Novel Prize. The awarding of the 2010 UK CILIP Carnegie Medal makes Gaiman the first author ever to win both the Newbery Medal and the Carnegie Medal with the same book.\n\nGaiman’s 2013 novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane was voted Book of the Year in the British National Book Awards and was a New York Times Best Seller. A film adaptation of the novel is planned.\n\nNeil Gaiman is married to the musician Amanda Palmer, they have a son, Anthony, together.\n\nTerry Pratchett was born in 1948 in Beaconsfield, Bucks, and decided to become a journalist after his first short story, ‘The Hades Business’, was published in Science Fantasy magazine when he was fifteen years old.\n\nHis first job was on the Bucks Free Press and he went on to work for various newspapers before becoming a publicity officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1980. He became a full-time writer in 1987. His first novel, The Carpet People (1971), a humorous fantasy, was followed by The Dark Side of the Sun (1976) and Strata (1981). 1983 saw the publication of The Colour of Magic, which became the first in a long series of Discworld novels. BBC Radio Four serialised The Colour of Magic and Equal Rites (1987)and these brought him great popularity. There are now more than 30 books in this series, set in a surreal world on the back of four elephants that stand on the shell of Great A’Tuin, the sky turtle. The Discworld series is popular world-wide and has led to the production of much related merchandise. Thud! (2005), features Sam Vimes, who has to get home each evening to read his son a picture book – Where’s My Cow?. Where’s My Cow?, published in 2005, alongside Thud! The latest novel in the series is The Unseen Academicals (2009).Hailed as one of the greatest humorous satirists, Pratchett was one of few writers to write across the adult/child divide. His book, Truckers (1989), was the first children’s book to appear in British adult fiction best-seller lists.\n\nTerry Pratchett wrote many novels for young readers, and the end-of-the-world novel Good Omens (1990) – in collaboration with Neil Gaiman. He also wrote several short stories, some of which are on Discworld themes. His books have sold over thirty-five million copies worldwide and have been translated into over thirty languages. ‘To say that Terry Pratchett is popular …’ writes Kate Saunders in the Sunday Express (2 June 1996), ‘ … is like saying the Arctic Circle is a bit nippy. He was awarded three honorary degrees, in 1999 by the University of Warwick, in 2001 by the University of Portsmouth, and in 2003 by the University of Bath. In 2009 he received a Knighthood.\n\nTerry Pratchett was involved with the Orang-Utan Foundation, and visited Borneo with a film-crew to make the documentary Terry Pratchett’s Jungle Quest for BBC Television. He lived with his family in Wiltshire.\n\nTerry Pratchett died in 2015, aged 66.\n\nBook discussion: ‘Good Omens’ by Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett\n\nWhen: Saturday April 22nd, 2023, at 18:00 (6pm, Madrid local time)\n\nWhere:\n\nEl Paraíso del Desierto\n\nC. del Dr. Esquerdo, 140, 28007 Madrid\n\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/3cQPsHcEfRvjNTGe9\n\nLanguage: English (we’ll debate in English)\n\nOrganizer: Adrian Diaz\n\nContact: +34 668853320\n\nMandatory: Read the book\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:\n\nIt’s not necessary to book in advance anymore, just show up at the designated place on the day and time of the discussion and we’ll be there.
