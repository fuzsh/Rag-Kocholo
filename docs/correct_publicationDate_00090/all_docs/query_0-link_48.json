        "text": "An adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Sir Terry Pratchett’s beloved 1990 novel Good Omens—about the Antichrist, an angel, a demon, and the end of the world—premiered on Amazon last month, to generally warm reviews from critics and fans alike. In this crowded and busy TV world, that might have been that. But last week, press caught wind of a petition started by the Christian group Return to Order—which accused this irreverent, comedic spin on the 1976 horror classic The Omen of mocking “God’s wisdom.”\n\nIn this new exclusive video, filmed before news of the petition broke, Gaiman explains why this story that he wrote decades ago with Pratchett—and brought to TV to honor Pratchett’s posthumous request—couldn’t have been made any other way.\n\nWhen Pratchett died in 2015, Gaiman was adamant that no Good Omens adaptation would ever happen without him. “Terry and I had a deal that we would only work on Good Omens things together,” Gaiman explained at a memorial event for Pratchett in 2016. “Everything that was ever written—bookmarks and tiny little things—we would always collaborate, everything was a collaboration.”\n\nBut Pratchett, perhaps anticipating that his friend would feel this way, arranged for a letter to be sent after his death in which he urged Gaiman to finish the adaptation without him. That makes Good Omens most likely the only TV series that involves a nearly 30-year wait, the death of a beloved coauthor, a posthumous wish, and the work of a devoted friend. “It’s a collaboration between Terry, young Neil, and older Neil,” series costar Michael Sheen told me when early footage premiered at the SXSW Film Festival in March.\n\n“For Neil, there’s something of a deathbed crusade in getting this made,” costar David Tennant agreed, speaking at SXSW as well. “He was doing it with so much care for the memory of Terry. There are little references, if you care to look, of Terry throughout the finished piece and the whole thing is dedicated to him.” The author’s trademark hat, a dramatic, broad-brimmed affair, oversaw the first table read.\n\nSome of the choices that got the protesting Christian group worked up are singular to the Good Omens TV series—like Gaiman’s decision to turn the book’s comical narration, the perfect blend of his sardonic wit and Pratchett’s whimsy, into a tongue-in-cheek voiceover from God, played by Frances McDormand.\n\nThat raised the hackles of the protesting Christian group. “God is voiced by a woman,” the petition complains.\n\nThen there are the “groups of Satanic ‘nuns’ that are chosen to raise the Antichrist,” as the petition puts it. “Terry would have loved the nuns,” Gaiman says in this new video. And though the petition never mentions the show’s depictions of heaven and hell, which do not appear in the novel, it’s not hard to imagine them objecting to them, either. In the Amazon show, heaven is seen as an antiseptic, joyless corporation in the sky led by Jon Hamm’s smug and intolerable angel Gabriel. Hell, on the other hand, is another set of offices, their own drippy, dank, fluorescent-lit nightmare.\n\nThese show inventions are, like nearly everything else, yet another way for Gaiman to honor Pratchett. “We started talking back in 89 about what we would do if we were telling this story as a movie or as TV,” he told me. “One of the things that we decided on right from the word ‘go’ is, we needed angels, we needed to see hell—which we never see in [the book]—and we needed to see heaven. I remember Terry talking about the idea of a skyscraper, with the guys in hell just down in the basement and the angels on the top floors.”\n\n“We all think we know what heaven and hell are like,” Hamm told me at SXSW. “And then, hang on, it's actually a lot worse than you think. It's smart and it allows the audience to be a part of it in a way that doesn’t pander.”\n\nGaiman, for his part, has been happy to poke fun at the petition, particularly its misguided target of Netflix (which does not air the show) instead of Amazon (which does):\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nEven Netflix U.K. got in on the fun.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIt’s a sly spirit that suits the tone of Good Omens, but belies the heartfelt story that has made it a classic. Nestled among the witty wordplay and quirky subplots, Good Omens does endeavor to tell an earnest story of friendship and an earthbound morality that defies the letter of the law. Or, as Sheen put it to me, “One part of the story is asking to not be taken seriously and another part of the story has to be taken seriously for it to work. How do you find a way to make both of those aspects of the story, the world, stick together?” The answer, it seems, is the special alchemical blend that comes from Pratchatt’s and Gaiman’s world views working together in harmony one last time."
