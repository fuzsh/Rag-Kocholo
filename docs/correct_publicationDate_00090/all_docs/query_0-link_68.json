        "text": "A landmark collaboration between two of Britain’s greatest authors, Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaimain, Good Omens is soon to be a major new television series starring Michael Sheen and David Tennant\n\n\"Armageddon only happens once, you know. They don't let you go around again until you get it right.\"\n\nAccording to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch - the world's only totally reliable guide to the future, written in 1655, before she exploded - the world will end on a Saturday.\n\nNext Saturday, in fact. Just after tea...\n\nPeople have been predicting the end of the world almost from its very beginning, so it's only natural to be sceptical when a new date is set for Judgement Day. This time though, the armies of Good and Evil really do appear to be massing. The four Bikers of the Apocalypse are hitting the road. But both the angels and demons - well, one fast-living demon and a somewhat fussy angel - would quite like the Rapture not to happen.\n\nOh, and someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist...\n\n‘It's a marvellously benign, ridiculously inventive and gloriously funny end-times fantasia featuring angels, devils, 17th-century prophets, witches and witchfinders, and the four horsemen of the apocalypse in modern guise… Only Death never changes, having never been away.’ – The Guardian\n\nUndoubtedly one of the world’s most enduringly popular and loved fantasy authors, Terry Pratchett created a universe many readers know as well, if not better, than their own. The Discworld Series, which began with The Colour of Magic, eventually spanned 41 books, with the final novel The Shepherd’s Crown being published just before the author’s death in 2015. He also wrote children’s books and is the co-author of the Parallel Earth series with Stephen Baxter. Margaret Atwood is just one of the many authors who counted Pratchett as an influence, calling him a writer of great humanity and inimitable humour; “with his passing”, she wrote, “the world is a less fantastic place.”\n\nPrimarily known as Britain’s foremost fantasy writer, Neil Gaiman is, as any of his readers and all Waterstones’ booksellers will know, much more than just that. Known by his colleague, co-author and regular illustrative collaborator Chris Riddell as the ‘wise wizard’, Gaimain’s is the mind that changed the course of the modern graphic novel through his Sandman series. In a multi-faceted career that has seen him variously as a short-story writer, screenwriter and critic he has also created such brilliant children’s classics as The Graveyard Book, Odd and the Frost Giants and Coraline and mastered blending the real with the wonderful and strange to deliver a stunning array of fantasy novels, contemporary myths and story collections including: Neverwhere, Stardust, The Ocean at the End of the Lane and the masterpiece that is American Gods.\n\nIncludes an exclusive introduction by the authors."
