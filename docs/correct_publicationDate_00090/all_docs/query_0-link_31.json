Relatively-minor-but-still-pretty-major reason: The various grammatical errors. I don't expect everyone online to write grammatically correct English. But if you are a journalist, I'd expect you to know basic grammar. If Sir Terry could read this article (and remember, Sir Terry was a journalist for a long time before he became an author), he'd be rolling in his grave.\n\n2. Pretty major reason: The author spells Neil's name as as \"Mr. Niel Gaiman\" (sp?). I wasn't aware Neil had suddenly become Scandinavian (akin to Niels Bohr).\n\n3. VERY major reason: This article says, and I quote:\n\nIt is being reported that Pratchett and Gaiman have planned about making the new season of the Good Omens.\n\nI really, really doubt that. There are only two ways that can be true:\n\n1. Neil secretly used a ouija board and leaked the outcome to this guy; or\n\n2. Terry has suddenly risen from the grave. (??)\n\nAll right, let's keep an open mind. Let's just assume, just for the sake of argument, that he had risen from the grave and somehow all of Britain's media missed it. Surely they wouldn't miss it for long ...\n\nSo you may call me Old Mister Cynical if you wish, but I call bull-- on this.\n\nUm ...

Surely they wouldn't miss it for long ...\n\nSo you may call me Old Mister Cynical if you wish, but I call bull-- on this.\n\nRath, Oh ye of little faith,\n\nWhen is Good Omens season 2 out?\n\nAmazon Prime has not officially confirmed the renewal of Good Omens for a second season, though reports from The Sun have suggested it has been given the green light.\n\nExpress.co.uk has contacted Prime Video for more information on whether season two will appear.\n\nNeil Gaiman, the original author of the book which inspired the show, also served as one of the lead showrunners and writers on the series.\n\nOver the years he has been very open on the potential of a sequel for the show, but he has been on the fence about the idea for quite some time.\n\nSpeaking to RadioTimes back in 2017, Gaiman said: “Terry [Pratchett] and I also plotted a sequel to Good Omens that we never did.\n\n“It was about where the angels actually came from, which is why it was pretty easy to add extra angels to this.”\n\nHmm. I am still skeptical -- for several reasons:\n\nFirst: I would like to know where did this quote came from.\n\nSecond: as below ...\n\nWhen is Good Omens season 2 out?\n\nAmazon Prime has not officially confirmed the renewal of Good Omens for a second season, though reports from The Sun have suggested it has been given the green light.\n\nExpress.co.uk has contacted Prime Video for more information on whether season two will appear.\n\n... I would not trust either The Sun or The Express to tell me that the sun revolves around the earth.\n\nThird: neither Amazon Prime nor Neil have either confirmed or denied that there is a Season 2. I won't believe it until it's been officially confirmed -- or for that matter, officially denied. As Tony Jay and Jon Lynn point out in \"Yes, Prime Minister\":\n\nRule One of Politics: Never Believe Anything Until It's Been Officially Denied.\n\nAnd I think we may add TV and films to that. As soon as someone says \"We're not doing another season of X\" or \"We're definitely not filming Y\", that means they are doing it, and just waiting for the right time to announce it.\n\nNeil Gaiman, the original author of the book which inspired the show, also served as one of the lead showrunners and writers on the series.\n\nThe Sun's article says Sir Terry wrote \"Good Omens\". The anonymous person who wrote this article says Neil did it. To paraphrase Bugs Bunny: \"He don't know the book vewy well, do he?\"\n\nOver the years he has been very open on the potential of a sequel for the show, but he has been on the fence about the idea for quite some time.\n\nSpeaking to RadioTimes back in 2017, Gaiman said: “Terry [Pratchett] and I also plotted a sequel to Good Omens that we never did.\n\n“It was about where the angels actually came from, which is why it was pretty easy to add extra angels to this.”\n\nOK, this seems more promising. But one quote to the Radio Times doesn't mean that a sequel is coming. One swallow does not a summer make; one quote does not a season make.\n\nI'm sorry to be so skeptical, but so far I have no reason not to be ... So, I'm willing to wait until there's proof that Season 2 is definitely coming.\n\nThe Soviets have a very wise saying: Doverai, ne proverai -- you can trust, but you'd better verify! So, I can wait. And you can call me Old Mr Cynical if you like.\n\n*sits, twiddles thumbs, hums \"The Girl from Ipanema\"*"
