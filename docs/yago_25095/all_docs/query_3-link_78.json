ENG650 is an optional enrichment course and is not required for graduation. This course benefits students who wish to receive additional practice writing in their genre or do additional work in a minor or another genre, provided they apply and are accepted to study in that area of concentration. Packets include original writing only. By taking the additional fifth semester before the MFA degree is conferred, students may qualify to receive financial aid to help defray tuition costs while enriching their course of study. For more information on this opportunity, contact Kathleen Driskell, Associate Program Director, at kdriskell@spalding.edu.\n\nCourse Description: ENG650Creative WritingMFA Residency 6 & Semester 5 Credit: 16 hours\n\nThis course includes a 10-day residency of workshops, lectures, conferences, and readings followed by a semester during which the student completes the Student Semester Study Plan. The Plan, which is created by the student and mentoring instructor, includes no more than five packets of original writing. Students submit residency, midsemester, and end-of-semester evaluations; and a Worksheet for their subsequent residency, when appropriate. ENG650 does not substitute for ENG610, ENG620, ENG630, or ENG640. Prerequisites: ENG610 and ENG620. (top)\n\nGraduates of an MFA program may take a post-graduate semester(s) if they would like further enrichment.\n\nPoetry: Cross-Genre Exercise and Interrelatedness of the Arts\n\nThe cross-genre exercise for May 04 is for all students, regardless of area of concentration to write a poem based on an art object or painting.
