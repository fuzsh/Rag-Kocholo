Significant for its architecture and its association with the social history of Honolulu, the home was one of the earliest in this area. It is a two-story Bungalow style house built by Alice Theodora Cooke and her husband Philip Edmunds Spalding on a large sloping property that is terraced into large lawn areas surrounded with lava rock retaining walls. Philip Spalding was a building contractor and may have designed the house and its accompanying cottage, which is attached to the garage. The home exemplifies the bungalow style built in Hawaii during the 1920s with deep lanais, overhanging eaves, easy access to outdoors, and good cross-ventilation. It has a rectangular plan, shingled walls, and gabled roof. The lanai originally had Doric columns, but was altered during a remodel of the ground floor by Vladimir Ossipoff in the 1950s.\n\nThis list of Hawaiiâ€™s historic properties is provided as a public service by Historic Hawaii Foundation.
