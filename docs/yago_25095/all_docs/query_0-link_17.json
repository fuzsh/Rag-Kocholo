        "text": "Got to 6:35 in this youtube clip of a GL episode. It takes place a day or so after Phillip got his father thrown out of Spaulding.\n\nThere's nice stuff here between Grant and Carl Evans who played his younger brother.\n\nYou hardly ever got to see dynamics between men like this on soaps. Normally, guys would always be pitted against each other, competing for the love of the same woman.\n\nThe acting, writing and characterization is quite good.\n\nI don't think the kid playing Alan-Michael was that good, but I think Grant's patience helps elevate him.\n\nThere's also some classic Alan/Alex stuff later in the same episode. I think it was their last scene together as Chris Bernau soon left the show and was replaced by Daniel Pilon.\n\nI recently visited the Paley Center in Los Angeles and saw several episodes of ATWT from the 1960's.They included,The complete 11/22/63 show which was never broadcast.Taped for the West Coast feed later that afternoon.The cast was unaware of the real-life tragedy unfolding in Dallas.The Christmas 1965 show which included characters Dan and Paul Stewart,Who, If you closed your eyes you may think he was being played by Davey Wavey.The highlight was the 1/5/66 show in which Ellen (then Cole) told the Stewart housekeeper Franny that upon her marriage to David Stewart her services will no longer be needed.Franny who had designs on being Mrs.David Stewart herself threatened to tell Dan Stewart (who was in fact Ellen's son born out-of-wedlock) Ellen freaked and bludgeoned the housekeeper with a statue.They have many more of ATWT,GL ,EON,SFT as well as other TV & radio shows.\n\nR28..I never understood why Marland did not bring up Ellen's murderous background...it would have made her more interesting. Seems he would be all over having Ellen break a leg and needing home assistance and its Frannie Brennan's psycho granddaughter who starts to drug her, and start a lesbian relationship with Emily for revenge..(1st Emily not boring blond helmet head Emily..)\n\nI started really hating soaps when the weird couple fans got involved...with the Carjack and worst of all was all the \"Gush\" fans! I remember this one woman..Della was her name who lived and died by Gush's daily make ups and break ups and this really weird woman who was almost stalking LW. Its almost like she didnt care about Cassie the character just LW answering her weird letters.\n\n[quote] That's true of most soap characters that started off as bitches and bastards. You could write a book about this trend.\n\nYeah, I think that's part of it.\n\nIn the old days you'd have a handful of regulars and then people who would be in their orbit for a few years.\n\nNow the villains and bitches/bastards stay and it's hard to sustain belief or interest. Is there anything that Victor Newman could do, short of setting Nikki on fire, that could surprise anyone?\n\nIs there anyone Carly on GH wouldn't sleep with?\n\nNo one really pays, or is ever affected by anything. That makes people not want to watch.\n\nYes, r37, I always thought that Reva should have ended up like her archetypal nemesis Miss Sally Gleason, interfering, manipulative, over-protective of her loved ones, throwing her boobs in the face of those she deemed lesser than her like Sally did her hats.\n\nHated when they turned 90s Reva into the Marlena Evans of GL, it's own Reillyesque cartoonish heroine. She was kidnapped and cloned and presumed dead and almost killed many times and time travelled through paintings. There was even that prerequisite Reva scene that had to take place in all of the storylines at some point - like the universe revolved around her. For months, Reva had absolutely nothing to do with the Holly-as-stalker story, but at the climax, she was suddenly thrown into it, talking a distraught Holly off a bridge.\n\nR60 Gush was Gus and Harley. I remember that Della poster wanted the show to be renamed \"GL, the new generation,\" or something with Gus and Harley as like a Nancy and Chris Hughes I guess. When people complained about people like Rick and Ross being put on recurring she would tell them times change. THEN Gus died and Harley left town a skanky ho and I thought she might have to be put on suicide watch.\n\nThe funniest was anything revolving around \"Manny,\" and \"Rassie,\" and one woman got hit by a car as she was so distracted worrying about Richard dying and then when they tried to put LW with the Danny actor people sent her Big Bird dolls (they called her big bird I guess) and Voodoo Dolls with pins in them! No wonder the execs gave us crap..look at the nuts watching this!\n\nr91, Dinah became obsessed with Hart, staging a suicide attempt, getting burned(literally) when one of her schemes backfired (pun intended - remember the scar on her face?), and getting pregnant by another man and calling it Hart's after drugging him. It would have been fine to watch this unravel as Dinah did since it tapped into GL's history of Vanessa and Nola's classic bad girl shenanigans, but it lead to a complete character assassination (Dinah KILLING Hart!) - and the fact she was not the only female unraveling in town at the time.\n\nBarbara Estesten and James Harmon Brown - who crafted the brilliant LOVING murders over at ABC and wrote the last season of DYNASTY - revealed themselves to be quite the misogynists during their tenure as co-HWs for GL in the late 90s - or maybe it was the influence of creep extraordinare Paul Rauch? Whatever the cause, all the women of Springfield turned into unbalanced hysterical messes.\n\nBeth returned to town with a complete character makeover - a manipulative, neurotic, grasping tramp; Blake was a 1950s horny housewife and adulterer; Nola was stalking Buzz and taking advantage of his amnesia to keep him away from Jenna; Holly was stalking the other women of Springfield, sending them threatening notes and poisoning them with spiders, kidnapping their children and eventually causing Jenna's death; Annie went super-psycho and spent her whole entire days obsessing over Josh and Reva and lying and scheming and hatching outlandish plots ... even Vanessa was considering a facelift to hold on to her younger husband. Women could only be neurotic, hysterical and crazy in Rauch's world.\n\nDid anyone find Lisa Brown hot?She might have been decent looking but she could act.There might have been better looking women on the show like Moniz,Wright,Budig etc so on but none had acting chops like Brown.\n\nIn the whole LA Bev vs LA Hubbard debate it's apples and oranges.I prefer Liz though.She had an edge that she nimbly kept in check in times.She was almost like an actress in an old screwball comedy.The type of woman who was called a dame back in those films.She also had some great interplay with Martha Byrne who was more of a personality than an actress.\n\nThey were always trying to create a worthy servant for Alex in line of a Vivian Gorrow ever since McKinsey joined the show - it was like it was a prerequisite for McKinsey, a \"given\".\n\nThey had that awful Jane character be her housekeeper when McKinsey first joined the show. Jane was an ex-con part of another storyline (something to do with Company and the Reardons?) and she recognized Alex from Alex's time in Milwaukee (where she lost her son). She was supposed to be straight-from-the-hip and wisecracking, but she wasn't funny and worthless and just disappeared without notice.\n\nThen Alex had Lillian's sister Calla Matthews as her Girl Friday, which worked well because it figured into many stories, and McKinsey and Lisby Larson had great chemistry dating back to their story together on TEXAS.\n\nThen years later, all of a sudden we had Vera, the big black Mamie who apparently brought Alex and Alan up when they were children and had been in the kitchen all these years. She worked the best with McKinsey, but it was just so forced that it was almost insulting (and a bit racist). Vera just disappeared too.\n\nThere was also a butler that appeared along with Vera (Fritz?). He was supposed to be comic relief. He just disappeared one day as well.\n\nI noticed watching Marland's episodes of GL on YT that servants were always given more consideration than just token background. Alan and Hope had the British Laurie for years, and Amanda had Maggie; Quint, of course, had Mrs. Renfield and Fritz the butler.\n\nIn the 90s, when she reigned as Spaulding queen, Jenna had the comedic team of Donna and Ginger (who was played by a young Alison Janney) as her maids. They stayed on for a while to work for Dusay's Alex.\n\nBecause the only work she got was a Designing Woman episode, a SEINFELD episode and a guest spot on MODELS INC. Her attempt to create another role with Pam Long on SANTA BARBARA was a disaster. JFP didn't want Zimmer back at all (a decision I actually agreed with), but caved to pressure from PTB to do the ghost story. Viewer reaction was positive, so JFP got the boot and Zimmer was told she was hired full-time. Newman was happy - he had been wanting her back since his return. They even made a point to appear together at a Soap Celebration telecast to start the ball rolling and drop thje idea in producers heads that fans wanted Josh and Reva back.\n\nNewman and Zimmer got what they wanted. Incidentally, after Josh and Reva came back to head the cast, GL proceeded to slowly die a long and painful death.\n\nR123 I doubt that it had such a big black audience before Mamie came on.That was my point.Mamie coming on was the beginning of that trend. Not because John and Mamie fell in love.\n\nBrenda Dickson was pure camp.Since this is a GL and kinda of a ATWT thread I don't remember anyone as bad as BD on those soaps.Keep in mind that Rauch was fucking the talent and Marland had a thing for feet.JFP was fucking one of the leads at AW and he wasn't that bad.BD must have given Bill Bell the best blow jobs he had ever got because she was one shitty actress.She was fun and nice to look at but a terrible actress.\n\nThis is a treat for history buffs.\n\nThere are actually episodes from as early as 1977 on YT. They were recorded with a video camera (filming the actual TV screen).\n\nThe episodes revolve around Bill Bauer's return from the dead - the Bauers are celebrating Mike's award from the Chamber of Commerce unaware their long-thought dead father is lurking in the shadows watching his son's honor.\n\nThe other major story is the arrival of the Spaulding family from Chicago. These are Alan Spaulding's first scenes in Springfield. Alan, his wife Elizabeth and their son Phillip are staying with Jackie Marler, whom Elizabeth met in Switzerland where she gave birth to Phillip. Little do the Spauldings know that Jackie is Phillip's biological mother.\n\nThis scene also marks the very first meeting between Alan and his future nemesis Mike Bauer (as well as Mike and Elizabeth)!\n\n(Interesting that Alan has instructed Elizabeth to find them a house in Springfield; it would later be rewritten that the Spauldings were one of the founding families of Springfield and they have lived there for generations).\n\nr136, Ed certainly had a type, or two to be exact. They were either too good for him (his first wife Leslie, whom he would beat in alcoholic rages, or Maureen, whom he cheated on not one but THREE times and eventually drove to her death) or they would cause him nothing but heartache (Holly, Rita and bad girl Vanessa). Ed was a self-destructive mess when you came right down to it.\n\nAs for a comparison between Holly and Rita: Holly was a wannabe daddy's girl whose rich daddy never loved her and who never knew what she wanted - or wanted what she couldn't have; Rita was a \"damaged good girl\" from the wrong side of the tracks who grew up wanting what she never had - and made alot of mistakes along the way. For both of them, good son Ed Bauer was the perfect ideal of model husband and society-family man who would give them the security and respect they craved. Unfortunately, for both of them, bad boy Roger Thorpe represented their baser instincts.\n\nRoger and Rita were involved years before she came to Springfield and she was forever trying to escape that part of her life but he would always come back to haunt her when she was trying to make good. And whenever Holly was going good, Roger would be there to draw her into temptation against her better judgement. Rita never loved Roger like Holly did, though. She was much more wiser in the sketchy ways of the world than Holly, who would end up paying dearly many times for loving Roger.\n\nThe brilliant writing and insightful characterization of the Dobsons helped to create two very distinct yet similar women whose lives would mirror one another in their own unique ways. The Dobsons didn't write a stereotypical whore or virgin, slut or villainess or one-note heroine. These were characters with their own personal motivations driving them. Credit must also go to Maureen Garrett and Lenore Kadorf for helping to bring to life two fascinating women who were neither good not bad, but much more complex and richer than that.\n\nIn fairness to Ed, he only turned to Claire for grief sex after they believed Fletcher and Maureen were dead.\n\n(Too bad GL never explored Fletcher being Michelle's dad -- after all, he had a baby with Holly long after he had the vasectomy. But then again I think there was a blood type incompatability with Claire and Fletcher so he was ruled out. I digress.)\n\nYes, Ed cheated on Maureen with Holly, but this was after Maureen had fallen for Fletcher.\n\nAnd Ed sleeping with Lillian was the definition of a pity fuck. She thought she was going to die and he threw her a bone.\n\nI wasn't against Maureen dying the way she did. It remains the most horrific and shocking death in soaps I think (not counting Frankie Frame.)\n\nBut GL really dropped the ball by not brining Claire or Rita back into Ed's life around that time.\n\nAlso, Hope was an ideal candidate to come back to the Bauers, live in the house to help care for Michelle and be the new matriarch.\n\nBut killing Maureen wasn't really about telling a great story; it was about clearing some space so that Justin Deas could join the cast, at least that's what I've always heard.\n\nWe lost Maureen and got Buzz Cooper, who chewed all the scenery it took to make Means 'n Wheels diner and Company.\n\nEllen Parker was exquisite and very instinctive in portraying Maureen in those scenes. She was very relatable in making the character undramatic yet interesting. There are plenty of actors who cannot balance that.\n\nI think [italic]Guiding Light[/italic] got rid of her, and killed off the character, because it had no real understanding how valuable the character was. (Killing off Maureen was [italic]Guiding Light[/italic]'s ignorant mistake.) And the drama had from that was only good for much of the duration of 1993. So, it was foolish. (And, I have come across info that Parker's dismissal was really a financial move to help the series make way for hiring Justin Deas who, as Buzz, started appearing the month after the Maureen Bauer character was killed off on Jan. 11, 1993.)\n\nAs for the actress supposedly being a pain in the ass…well she was there for six/seven years. So, she must not have been too much of a pain in the ass for it to have taken six/seven years for her firing. I think that assertion comes from people who, needlessly, are trying to convince viewers that we should let [italic]Guiding Light[/italic] off the hook. That is actually strange. The CBS soap was canceled six years ago. That final airdate, for both Ellen Parker and Maureen Bauer, was 22 years ago. And the topic is, apparently, still unforgettable and very meaningful.\n\nI don't think Ellen Parker was any of the things listed above. She was LOVED on set for her professionalism. They asked her back (after Mo's death) as often as possible.\n\nBut the thing was, the network never liked Parker's portrayal of Maureen, nor did the suits at the time who ran P&G. She was cast for her likeness to Ellen Dolan, but while a handsome enough woman, she was not as photogenic as Dolan.\n\nI remember reading a Digest interview (circa 1992, but before her character's death was known) where she said that she saw Dolan on the street, and Dolan told her that they'd asked her back to play Maureen.\n\nParker had fan support but that was it. They never knew what to do with Ed and Mo. And she would have likely been cut a few years later, anyway, when they started putting older actors on recurring.\n\nYes, Ed was a very complex character in the early years of GL. The Bauers, in fact, were not your typical soapy core family like the other shows. The family was ripe with deeply emotional issues.\n\nBefore she grew into the wise and loving matriarch, Bert started out as a selfish and status-seeking housewife whose nagging and demands on weaker husband Bill Bauer chipped away at his insecurities, exacerbating his alcohol problem and driving him to extramarital affairs.\n\nTheir eldest son Mike was always the more level-headed one, trying to make peace and find balance in the family, while youngest son Ed was more hotheaded. His complete hatred for his weak-willed father fueled much of the drama for the family for years. He even at one point caused his father to have a heart attack after a confrontation between them became violent.\n\nIt was poetic irony that he would end up more like Bill than anyone. Like Bill, he was an alcoholic, and that led to alot of anger in Ed, who ended up taking it out physically on his wife Leslie (Rick's mother), who was actually in love with her brother-in-law Mike. A Cain and Abel-type rivalry erupted between the brothers for a long time.\n\nA clip of Robert Gentry's Ed and his first wife Leslie discussing their fathers:\n\nSay what you want about JFP, she not only oversaw what has come to be considered a golden age of creative brilliance for the show, but she also revitalized the masculine element of the show by dusting off the long-ignored vets and spearheading their renaissance, in particular Peter Simon and Jerry ver Dorn, who had both lanquished on the backburner for decades under other executive producers. Both men were over 40 and proved themselves beyond anyone's expectations with the stories they had during JFP's reign. And both showed men over 40 could be SEXY.\n\nIt was also the first and only time I ever really liked Jay Hammer, who worked well with KInkead, Garrett and Dusay during those years. Who can forget when Holly took Fletcher right then and there on a desk at the Journal late at night?\n\nThe character of Ed Bauer was an asshole. And he was a double-standard asshole. He fucked three women, behind Maureen's back, and produced a child outside their marriage, and then asked Maureen to please consider Michelle (his biological daughter with another woman, with whom he had cheated while married to Maureen) for the possible impact of Maureen leaving.\n\n[italic]Guiding Light[/italic] made an irreversible mistake in killing the character of Maureen Bauer in 1993.\n\nI noted it.\n\nI'm not saying that firing actress Ellen Parker was wrong so much as was the choice of killing off the character.\n\nThe Ghost[s] Return[s] nonsense was cheap shit nearly all the daytime soaps were willing to do because, in hindsight, they were mistaken for their killing[s] off such characters. And they're always a farcical joke: A character remembers his/her dead loved one[s]; suffers a near-fatal incident; briefly visits Heaven; converses with dead loved one[s]; get inspiration to go on and continue to live. What we viewers were never supposed to notice was that the actors playing those deceased loved ones [italic]aged[/italic].\n\nR183, I don't think verDorn and Simon exactly suffered under Marland and Pam Long.\n\nEven if what you say about the men under JFP is true, the women certainly did not do well.\n\nUnder Phelps, GL lost K. Simms, McKinsey and Sherry Stringfield -- and Parker. (Yes, Sherry wanted to leave, but I bet Simms and McKinsey could have been convinced to stay -- or return.)\n\nAnd when you know you've lost the first three, do you really want to throw another vet like Parker out?\n\nPlus, when General Hospital lured Luke and Laura back in 1993 the SMART thing would have been for GL to invite Zimmer back to counter GH's move in the ratings.\n\nInstead, we got Tangerine Hill, a character that went nowhere and sucked up valuable air time and resources.\n\nI give props to a producer like Joe Wilmore. in 1986, he brought Bernau, Simon, Newman and Aleksander back to the show.\n\nBut under Phelps all we got were out of work Santa Barbara actors in the cast in everything from contract to supporting roles.\n\nNot only that, r189, but the fact that characters who died because their protrayers did in real-life never make a ghostly drop-in make the whole ghost-card even more irritating. Maureen, Jenna, Nadine and Sarah made post-mortem visits to their offspring, but Bert, Henry and HB never could. Over at Y&R, John still drops in every now and then even though he died years ago, but we'll never see Katherine.\n\nAbsolutely HATE the ghost cameos. It only worked once with Holland Taylor's guest return to EDGE of NIGHT years ago after her nefarious Denise Cavanaugh was killed off, only because it worked so well into her widower Miles' drug-induced hallucinations. It made sense he would be haunted by her.\n\nThey never gave Michael O'Leary THAT story that would help propel Rick into genuine leading man material. Like Ed's relationship with his own father, there should have been a re-examination of this father-son relationship. What does the affect of having a man like Ed as a father have on a son? The parade of endless stepmommies and romantic indiscretions, the years of being shipped off to boarding school while Ed lived his emotional rollercoster life, dealing with endless bouts of Ed's self-destructive behavior, and most notably, the sordid details of Ed's behavior towards his own mother Leslie. Like Luke and Laura on GH, the taboo should have been finally dealt with - Ed was a physically abusive husband.\n\nThey missed their opportunity after Maureen's death, in which Rick should have returned and after discovering the details of Ed's indiscretion with Lillian, start to realize the damage Ed has indirectly caused the family over the years. No more being the passive good son, Rick should have finally called his father out on all the damage he had done to the Bauer family unit. Loads of material there to use for great family drama.\n\nI am convinced much of Rick's attraction to Phillip was the fact essentailly self-absorbed and conflicted Phillip was very much like Ed.\n\nThe psychology of Ed Bauer was that he was getting even with his mother for allowing his father to treat her like shit and getting even with his father for treating his mother like shit. He had a nice girl like Leslie, he would beat her up and force her to fuck him while she was pining away over Mike. He was really beating up his mother. When he got the wife abuse thing out of his system, he started going after women who needed saving but in turn would give him nothing but heartache. Women like Rita and Holly would get into some kind of trouble or go and fuck Roger and Ed would take them back to protect them because he was saving his Mother from his father. When he finally got a good woman, he reverted back to his base instincts of looking for women in danger who were nothing but trouble but who could fuck his brains out. That's the story of Ed Bauer a constant rejection of Bill and Bert Bauer played out in one man's romantic life.\n\nThe problem with the Ed character is that they found an actor who could play the character in an exciting, dynamic and provocative way. Gentry was too angry and Marty and Peter Simon were kind of sad sacks. Ed didn't pop off the screen like Zaslow's Roger or Bernau's Alan. They needed an actor who could play all those conflicting emotions and they never found one.\n\nJust in fairness to Ed here, he 'cheated' on Maureen with Claire after they both thought Fletcher and Maureen had been killed.\n\nHe turned to Holly when he and Maureen were on the outs (she had fallen in love with Fletcher).\n\nAnd Lillian was a pity fuck because she was dying.\n\nI do like the character development suggested by R206. I never thought O'Leary could handle heavy drama though. He was always throwing in stuff for laughs. Overkill.\n\nPost-Maureen, GL dropped the ball by not bringing back Rita or Claire or Hope to fill in various voids left by Maureen.\n\nIt was awful we didn't see Rick or Chelsea or Bea (!) at the funeral.\n\nThat said, the dialogue in those episodes was brilliant. It remains among the most powerful stuff I've ever seen.\n\nR199, sorry I re-read what I wrote and I could see where there's confusion.\n\nI definitely recall the slut of Springfield fountain scene in '84...I hung in there with the show throughout '86 and early '87 through post-Long regimes. (It was tough!)\n\nBut I remember sometime in the summer of 1987, the show started to get better again. This was in the days before every little move was reported immediately by the soap press and twitter.\n\nThere was a scene that summer -- and I'm not sure whether it was before or after Reva's infamous 'hungry monologue' -- in which Josh and Reva ran into each other at Vanessa's garden (or wherever that party was held back in '84) and they hashed out their relationship.\n\nI saw it and I thought, wow, if I didn't know better I'd think Pam Long was back.\n\nSometimes writers' stuff starts hitting the air before their names pop up and their names remain on the credits after they're gone.\n\nThe Long era was a Golden Age for GL.\n\nI have had heated debates with people who call it 'the Reva show' under Long. Was she a favorite? Of course. But so was Phillip.\n\nAnd any scene with McKinsey and Bernau was gold.\n\nBeth and Lujack. Mindy's antics. Roxie Shayne! Fletcher and Claire in Barbados! It was a fun-filled ride that I wish had lasted forever.\n\nI loved the Phillip Spaulding story that Long crafted upon her return in 87, revisiting his conflict with Alan and having things come full circle by turning the family against him. It eventually led to the Neil Everest-Gary Swanson story in which he faked his death. It was great saga-writing.\n\nThe Sonni story started out well with amazing find Michelle Forbes, whom Long seemed more obsessed with than she ever was with Zimmer. The writers strike really hindered the progress of this story which kind of fell into a convoluted mess.\n\nAnd I am indebted to Long for bringing Roger, Holly and Chrissy back to the mix. Kudos to her for doing that.\n\nThe only thing I really hated during her return as HW was the way she wrote Alan. I just never bought his obsession with Reva to the point he was willing to sacrfice his empire. I thought that was so plot-dictated.\n\nThose who still resent Ed for cheating on Maureen may get a kick out of this episode from 1979 when Ed is told by his wife Rita that she had an affair with another man during their marriage.\n\nIt precedes Ed and Maureen's emotional confrontation in the cabin many years later, where Ed is the one who has been betrayed by a self-destructive spouse. It is great domestic drama that soaps just lost the ability to do a long time ago.\n\nLenore Kasdorf was just sublime, so subtle and understated. I am glued to the screen when she is on it.\n\nBtw, have patience with this episode - it repeats the prologue once, and for some reason includes both the American and the German opening, but the episode is in its entirety. Seriously worth watching.\n\nBonus: we see Katie Parker doing her insane puppet act.\n\nPS: I am also in love with the character of Diane Ballard, who in this episode realizes Alan has once again chosen another woman (Hope) over her.\n\nr210, I always rejected that \"in fairness\" excuse for Ed's grief-fuck with Claire. What man is so devastated by his wife's violent death that he sleeps with her best friend - HOURS after the woman's death? An inherently immature and self-absorbed one. Nothing fair in that situation at all. And the fact that he repeats the behavior two more times reveals Ed as a fuck-up.\n\nr209, Gentry appeared to play the hothead and spoiled Ed well, and then they wanted him to be more of a middle-class husband type - a safer type - so Mart Hulswit looked the part. He was actually quite sexy in a cute befuddled suburban way. He did start to pack on the pounds near the end, and Peter Simon was a bizarre choice for me at the time. He was younger, but not exactly dynamic or anything noteworthy - not even goodlooking. It took me a long time to actually like him in the role.\n\nI think I am one of the few GL fans who actually liked Richard Van Vleet in the role. There was something sexy about his Ed - he looked like he would be a good fuck. And he played drunk well.\n\nIt wasn't until the JFP years that I came to adore Simon, whose performances as an adulterer and a fuck-up were at times brilliant stage work. He came to be the definitive Ed from then on, although they briefly attemtped to fill his shoes with the original Ed again by bringing Robert Gentry back to the role. He was a nice nod to history, but had revealed himself to have grown into a stiff and ineffective actor.\n\nIn the end, if I had to pick between the Eds, I would have to go with Simon.\n\nI used to think Marland's era was my favorite, but watching all the 79 episodes on YT I have to say the Dobsons were geniuses. Their show was brilliant, and the stories they created sustained the shows for the next couple of decades.\n\nI love Marland's early stuff, but I wonder if Harding Lemay had more of an influence on the scripts than anyone realizes because the latter Marland stuff is less drawing room drama and more sensational soapiness with the OTT Quint-Nola Indiana Jones adventures, the Carrie Todd story and the Jennifer-Mark-Amanda triangle.\n\nLong redefined the show for the rest of the 80s.\n\nLoved Curlee and Demorest and those years under JFP, and then the show suffered one writing team after the other until the end (with the brief respite with Taggert and Culliton, both of whom seemed quite capable of picking the show up from the likes of a Marland or a Long).\n\nI do regret we never saw Long write for the show again.\n\nAll in all, the Dobsons are my favorite era.\n\nWhatever happened to the Dobsons?\n\nI believe Calla was mentioned a couple of times by Lillian through the years. I think she was mentioned by Lillian during the breast cancer story. She called her on the phone or something (or am I imagining that?).\n\nBut, yes, after Simon and Jessie left they were never metioned again. I remember a particular scene after Simon said goodbye to Alex and left Springfield, she was seen reminisicing through a montage of their relationship, and then closed a music box that was playing, a symbolic gesture that that chapter was closed and she was moving on with her life. It literally ended Simon's very existance on the show.\n\nI actually liked the Matthews family. It was an era of soaps when the lower-class were still a part of the social fabric. And it was a story about class structure - an Upstairs/Downstairs type story. Larson was perfect as the social climbing wannabe with an embarrassing secret (her ex-husband gave her gonorrhea). She worked well with McKinsey, ver Dorn and Sloan. But near the end, the writers had no idea what they wanted from Calla, Jessie or Simon. It was an interesting chapter of the show though, before Willmore came back to take it back to its roots.\n\nInteresting trivia: Mary Kay Adams was originally hired to play Beth's social-climbing cousin India. They changed her character at the last minute to play Alex's stepdaughter.\n\nThe Dobsons, last I heard, were living happily in Atlanta off all the Santa Barbara money -- they made a lot off that show.\n\nThey came to the Writers Guild Awards a while back and presented. They looked well-rested and fantastic.\n\nIronically, they created Phillip who was written by almost every regime until the show's end.\n\nI thought his return in 96 was handled so poorly. The whole Neil Everest story was re-written/amended so that Alan was in on it with him. And poor Grant - he'd only worked with Rick Hearst briefly (who soon left after Grant's return) but there was also a new Alan, Alex and Amanda.\n\nThe story they missed was bringing Phillip and Beth back together (they broke up off camera due, in part, to Alan -- shock!) and have them meet Nick. Beth could have fallen in love with Nick, eventually realizing he wasn't Lujack so she wanted Phillip back only he would have moved on to someone else before they later find their way back together.\n\nOn one of those 79 episodes, a character described Rita as \"restless\", as in she would never be able to settle down even though she wanted to. She was just propelled to always move and create trouble for herself.\n\nHolly, on the other hand, was never restless. She wasn't her own worst enemy. She just made some bad choices because she never clearly knew what she wanted.\n\nI'm currently watching Rita going antsy being forced to play suburban housewife in a gorgeous SPanish-style villa that became the Bauers homstead for so many years. She has been forced to give up her job at Cedars and take care of Christina while Holly is in prison, and resents the hell out of the whole situation. She does not want to take care of Holly's daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, Holly is telling her cellmate (played by Anna Maria Hosford of AMEN fame) that when it comes down to it, she doesn't like Rita and doesn't like her taking care of her daughter.\n\nI find all of this the most involving, engaging, engrossing stuff I have watched in years.\n\nWhatever happened to Holly's slavishly devoted boyfriend Peter Chapman? He was cute and so sooo in love with her. He even got a job at the prison so they can be together, snogging in the infirmary.\n\nIlligetimatcy was still a taboo back then. It was an embarrassment and a shame to have a child out of wedlock. Watching those scenes on YT of Jennifer's big moment on the stand, I was slightly amused by Morgan's reaction. She yelled out in horror and ran from the courtroom; Amanda, too, tried to flee in horror and ended up miscarrying. Today, we are much less naive of such things. I actually found the innocence displayed in these episodes quite charming if not ridiculous.\n\nPlus, Jennifer was trying to protect Amanda from knowing the truth after Lucille died because Amanda was pregnant and she didn't want to jeapordize her condition.\n\nThey played with the idea of Beth having a knight in shining armor. Beth was pretty independent, artistic and very smart. Everyone thought she was pretty. She got a job at the Boardinghouse, stood up to Bradley (which in turn angered him and he raped her) but it is something Lilian never did up until that point. She dumped Phillip when he cheated on her. She went for a gang member in Lujack, helped him bust out of prison and stood up the the Galahads. She stood up to Alan. She stood up to Roger. Some fans think of Beth as weak but I don't see it. Just the opposite. Which makes it a shame the writers did major character assassination on her to the point even Vincent I said something on a soap panel about how GL was writing Beth and how they were ruining the character.\n\nPaul Roach oversaw the complete destruction of the character of Beth as well as the other ladies of Springfield. By the time he FINALLY left, the damage was irreparable. Future writers had Beth suffer a split personality (the Godawful Lorelei shit) and eventually marry Alan!\n\nLooking back, I feel quite comfortable saying GL was over for me during the 60th anniversary celebrations in which Mike Bauer and Harley Cooper came back for a visit, Sarah Shayne died, and the citizens of Springfield banded together - friends and enemies - to get the lighthouse back in working order. That would have been a fitting end to the show.\n\nAfter that, it truly became a different show completely devoid of the heart and soul that made it what it was for almost a decade and a half for me. I didn't need to see the rich and valuable history rewritten and the tragic character assassinations. I didn't need to see lilywhite mobsters and royal fruitcakes shit on legacy and piss their superficiality all over the landscape I once called a second home. I didn't need to see TV's longest running show literally pushed out of the studio and into the street and forcing its actors to become street buskers.\n\nGL died a long time before it was officially cancelled.\n\nSo it was Paul R who was the culprit behind the destruction of Beth? It was very shocking the extent to which they rewrote her. Someone with that history on the show. The Four musketeers story is iconic. Beth was a pretty beloved character and was involved with two huge supercouples. I really thought they would explain her personality change, give her motivation and eventually repair the damage. But it got worse and worse and worse to the point they humiliated the character when all the female characters pretty much made fun of her at Blake's house (some party, can't remember what for). Does anyone remember that? I remember thinking, damn, all of you are not perfect in any way yet they thoroughly trashed Beth. Beth was a rape survivor so I am surprised they wrote her the way they ended up writing her during the late 90's/to mid 00's. It wasn't until the very end some semblance of the original Beth showed up.\n\nI agree, the show became clones, time travel (the ABSOLUTE WORST IDEA EVER), San ChristoHELL, and GH lite mobsters. Awful and shocking that a sophisticated and glamorous show like GL devolved into that.\n\nR252 Yes, I could buy Beth with a bit of an edge but she came back a complete mess and they never did a good job explaining it or repairing it quickly enough.\n\nHer being with Alan is perhaps the worst thing they did in the last 9 years of the show. It shit on so much history. For Beth to marry and have a child with ALAN is just...ugh...I can't. I could see why Alan would become attracted to her (everyone was in love with Beth at some point) but SHE would NEVER. lol\n\nLainie Marler was introduced as a track star and Olympic hopeful who was paralyzed after a car accident soon after her arrival in Springfield. She was first intended to be a new romantic interest for the unhappily married Ed, a story that was dropped for whatever reason.\n\nShe briefly dated Floyd Parker, but ended up falling in love with art gallery owner Carter Bowden. She surprised her brothers when she got out of her wheelchair and walked at her wedding to Carter. For a long time, Lainie was just a supporting character, working at Mike Bauer's law office and becoming his confidante and sounding board. She sided with Mike against her brother Ross, who found himself facing off with Bauer during the Jennifer Richards trial.\n\nMarland was beginning to develop an adversarial flirtation between Lainie and Mike's new partner Derek Colby. Then, suddenly, she was written off when she and Carter moved out of town. Marland brought her back for a brief guest spot at the end of his run when she was seen hosting a visiting Jackie Marler, who had fled Springfield because she though Justin and Carrie were having an affair. Lainie counselled Jackie through the crisis and kept in contact with Justin. Jackie agreed to go back home, but died en route in a plane crash.\n\nRoss brought up his MIA sister in the late 80s and mentioned she and Carter divorced and she was now living in Australia. I believe she was mentioned again during the Ben Warren story. I have no idea if they mentioned her during Ross' funeral because I had stopped watching the show by then. The actress was fine enough, but the character just never seemed to catch on.\n\nThe idea behind Beth marrying Alan was actually interesting and like so many of Kreizman's stories, good on paper but no follow through. When she married him he was in the nuthouse for \"killing,\" Phillip, and she had to hold on to her power at Spaulding to protect her kids (she like myself, must not have liked that pursed lipped Gus who they were going to vote for Spaulding chair...) It was not a love match as Alan wanted to smoke Phillip out and thought that marrying Beth would work. That would have been a good start if they kept it up and Alan manipulated Beth from behind the scenes to bring out a darker side of her. They could have had the Rick Beth affair and then Phillip comes back to find Beth knocked up by his best friend and married to his father. But Kreizman screwed it up by having Harley voted in a CEO and then Beth feel in love with Alan and was getting it on with him....EWWW.\n\nThe first year of Kreizman wasn't heinously bad, and he did improve on the shitstorm that was Ellen Weston.\n\nHe had some good ideas, but his stories, when they were any good, were always good for about three weeks, and then they petered out.\n\n[quote] Jonathon was actually a Curlee story...he was going to be Reva's stalker...but they dropped it and made that guy with the bug eyes talking to his puppet, Sandy Jonathon..\n\nUh, no. Curlee was gone long before the whole San Cristobel thing even happened. Esensten and Brown wrote all that.\n\nThey did clearly change their minds and made Sandy not be Jonathan. The actor reminded me of Robert Newman (Josh) and I kept thinking Sandy would be revealed as Josh and Sonni's son.\n\nRon Raines was as terrible a recast as Marj was as Alex. Ruined any possible avenue they could have taken with either character.\n\nAlex would have NEVER let Beth marry Alan for whatever reason. Beth was like a daughter to Alex. And Beth, at least the original Beth, would have NEVER allowed herself to be taken in by Alan or use Alan by marrying him to get control of Spaulding even for her children. That was not the Beth that Long wrote from 83-91. There was a lot they could have done with Beth but they needed to write the motivation behind it. The character was too important to latter day GL to let some idiot rewrite her and ruin the character. I remember my aunt, who stopped watching GL in 94, watching again in the late 90's and being floored by the way they were writing Beth. I am glad Vincent Irizzary spoke out on the destruction of Beth. He was disgusted by the way they ruined the character.\n\n\"Uh, no. Curlee was gone long before the whole San Cristobel thing even happened. Esensten and Brown wrote all that.\n\nThey did clearly change their minds and made Sandy not be Jonathan. The actor reminded me of Robert Newman (Josh) and I kept thinking Sandy would be revealed as Josh and Sonni's son.\"\n\nSorry, I meant to say Taggert..she created the storyline of Jonathon being a hellion and recentful of Reva but they made Alex of all people her stalker and then created Sandy.\n\nHe reminded you of Newman? I could see him being crazy Soni's kid with those eyes of his popping all the time. When Jonathon first came on and Pelphery had the sexual vibe he would do anything and anyone, Jonathon got up on top of Sandy in the hospital bed and taunted him and I thought ...wow..they are going to go there with those two..but no, Jonathon became a boring soap rebel in love with the bland and boring Tammy and Pelphery just became a screaming scenery chewer.\n\nI was never a big Tom Pelphrey fan. I recognized Pehlphrey as talented, but he was just too intense, too scarey. Had this Charles Manson type rage/insanity going on behind his eyes that repulsed me.\n\nI especially turned off by the cousin romance with Tammy. Yes, the two had chemistry, but should have undone her parentage if they were going to do that romance rather than have an incest storyline.\n\nOnly time I ever liked Pelphrey, or Jonathan, was when paired with Reva. They worked very well together, amazing chemistry. He brought out a bit of the wildness in the boringly domesticated Reva, while she bought out a much needed calmness in Jonathan.\n\nI thought Pelphery brought a much needed earthy sexuality to a \"young stud,\" role on soaps...all those guys on Days and other shows looked so feminine and yes, well groomed...(Jonathon is like some guy you would make take the side entrance out of your place.) Jonathon looked like he knew what to do and didnt worry about mussing his hait. That was definately what made me see him as Reva's kid, though he used his sexuality as a weapon (seducing his cousin to hurt his mother) while she used it to cover her insecurities and to get acceptance. Unfortunatley they dropped that part of it as soon as the poor fat teenage girls at home started mooning over him. I thought his thing with Lizzie would have been good if Alan hired him to seduce her away from the boring Coop...but the miscast Lizzie with Marcy Rylan who is cute, but could not play a damanged daughter of Beth and Phillip.\n\nI think Pelphery got bored after the first six months.\n\nR301\n\nI don't believe Pelphrey became bored. He was fresh out of college and landed his first real gig.\n\nHe has always talked very highly and appreciative of his time on GL and the relationships he made.\n\nIf he was bored he wouldn't have agreed to return for 2 short stints once he'd left.\n\nR308\n\nI thought he was amazing in those episodes where Tammy died. That whole storyline was very good. Excellent work by Pelphrey and the others.\n\nThat whole week of episodes are on YT. IIRC they're titled A Death in the Family.\n\nEven all these years later I will still sob like a blubbering fool.\n\nIt's almost a good thing they didn't bring Lujack back when they originally planned to. We had already journeyed through three back-from-the-dead stories (Roger, Beth and Phillip) that the Spauldings experienced one atop the other. To then have Lujack come back from the dead, we would have descended into complete campiness, the very state General Hospital has been currently suffering through under FV/RC.\n\nI liked the Nick McHenry story and the character, although we had to suffer through some OTT implausibilities (Alex not remembering she gave birth to twins, an Italian thinking he was an Irishman), but VI and BM especially made the story work. I especially remember a scene when Nick was looking at a home movie of Lujack up on a screen and he was mesmerized by the eerie likeess he shared with him, Lujack's image projected over Nick's body.\n\nBM leaving during the story hurt, and they didn't seem to know where they wanted to take Nick. His chemistry with Barbara Crampton was niland his subsequent romance with the AIDS woman was out-of-left-field and boring. They missed their opportunity to keep him when Aleksander came back, or at least bring him back when they brought Beth back. We didn't necessarily have to have Lujack back for Beth to truly deal with her feelings for him. I just never bought Phillip and Beth.\n\n309 I disagree. I think that Pelphery was very happy to have his first job out of school and liked who he was working with etc, but that does not mean he was excited about the material. His first few months were full of non soapy energy, and then, over acting and manic took the place of that energy. I think Zimmer is partially to blame as she said in an interview she told him he needed to develop some \"tricks,\" like she did to act in a soap day in and day out. I think TP developed them in spades with that laugh and gritting his teeth all the time. If he had good material and good direction and if they hadnt burned him out playing every day, he would have been great.\n\nThe Tammy death really didnt effect me at all as others said, it became a thing where everyone in SF was wrong..hell if Bert Bauer was alive she would have had to grovel at his feet. It started out that Jonathon was villain but they rewrote it to the dull story it became. Also, as with everything else on GL, it had no repercussions. Alan didnt go to prison, etc.\n\nr316..the whole thing was weird. They aged the character older then his older brother, and hooked him up with a de-aged (and unattractive) daughter of Harley...who was born on the show, what 23 or something years before him! Wheeler was delusional.\n\nSpeaking of, what happened to her latest project where she was getting \"the band back together,\" of GL people she worked with and she was dumb enough to promote it from the bad old Peapack park pavillian thing they would film in all the time? Did Peapack put a restraining order on her for making their town look like crap when she filmed?\n\nTrue, the network and the ingrates at P&G were first and foremost to blame for GL and ATWT demise. With full backing from them, both shows would have been fine and they wouldn't have hired Wheeler or the crappy HW's they did.\n\nAs far as Lujack, I was happy they brought in his twin first. But they missed a truly huge story in Nick/Beth. The story that could have come out of that was endless with wonderful possibilities. What a missed opportunity! Could have provided years of rich story, history and character driven story. THEN you could have added LUJACK coming back into the picture and really created something incredible. Never understood why someone didn't make it happen.\n\nVincent did not return to GL in 2006 after he left Y&R; they would have been wise to grab him, but at this point I think P&G just wanted the show axed.\n\nImagine Nick going back to Springfield with or without Susan, he falls for Beth and she for him. And THEN Phillip comes back?\n\nThat shit would have written itself.\n\nImagine if CBS and P&G had rehired Pam Long in 2002 and she went gangbusters and the show shot up to # 2 or # 3.\n\nImagine if P&G said Okay, we want out of the soap biz, but this thing is now making big money for us again so we'll stay in it.\n\nBev also stayed extremely close with her former TEXAS co-star Daniel Davis until the very end.\n\nShe was good friends with Michelle Forbes too, but I don't know if they remained close after Forbes left the show. I remember a SOD article that went backstage at GL and it noted that the reclusive McKinsey was in her dressing room with Forbes smoking cigarettes with her. I think I noted that because at the time Alex and Sonni were best friends on the show and I always caught a huge lesbo vibe between the characters and the actresses.\n\nBev's sexual ambivalence - usually reserved for quasi-incestuous chemistry with men who played her family members - came out in spades in her scenes opposite Forbes. I thought it was just the actresses' personal subtext, but then there was scene where Alex and Sonni were sitting on the foot of a bed while Sonni confessed to killing Will and Alex was consoling her and promising to help her. I thought the two women were actually going to end up kissing.\n\nThen of course we had Holly and Alex working together to trap Roger in his lies. McKinsey and Garrett acted like they were going to take one another down n the floor everytime they had a scene.\n\nr368 Grant's bulge visible? Practically any scene where Phillip was wearing a Speedo or jeans.\n\nHowever, there was a scene in Aug 1983 where Grant unintentionally got an errection that was seen on camera.\n\nPhillip was sitting on the sofa watching Mindy do yoga. He soon got an erection, but to cover it up he put his moved his leg.\n\nUnfortunately, it's not available on YouTube. Wish it were, because it was quite long\n\n[quote] I was disappointed that so many characters faced the chopping block once Pam Long hit town.\n\nMost of those changes came from the network. It was the big push to update the show - Marland fought it during his regime but with a new and inexperienced HW they called for a lot of cuts, especially to the Bauers.\n\nLong often gets blamed for that, but she had a number of long term stories for those characters that were cut (when the network pushed out Don Stewart, who played Mike Bauer, for example).\n\nI think Pat Falken Smith and L. Virginia Brown were head writers in between Marland and Long.\n\nI believe it was Brown that wrote Phillip back onto the scene.\n\nI couldn't believe how many TEXAS actors were brought over to GL. Harley Kozak and Michael Woods played siblings on TEXAS, but in-law/love interests on GL.\n\nIt was tough seeing all the cast changes, but along the way something happened -- the show got great again. It wasn't the Dobsons or Marland, but Long's GL became a show I had to watch every day, rich, colorful characters and hardly any recap -- the kind that Marland was famous for. (But don't get me wrong, he was the best.)\n\nOnce Charita died, I would have brought Hope back in some capacity and groomed her into the maternal talk to that Bert was for everyone.\n\nIt made no sense that she never came to town again, especially for Bert's memorial.\n\nI honestly think that by the time Phillip's paternity came out Elizabeth was all but forgotten.\n\nI recall Grant as Phillip having one-way phone calls with Spaulding in later years and he'd say, 'Thanks, Evie,' who was on the show back in the '80s.\n\nI got the impression Grant was always adlibbing stuff like that -- mentions about Evie and Vera and Joseph long after they were gone.\n\nLong time fans appreciated that.\n\nOne of the last Elizabeth references I recall was at Vanessa's winter gala that brought Alexandra back to Springfield. Beth was wearing a dress and Phillip said it was Elizabeth's wedding dress.\n\nMissed Opportunities, indeed.\n\nRefresh my memory about Phillip's parentage. It's all foggy.\n\nHe was raised thinking Alan was his father but his real father was Justin? How did Alan come to raise him instead of Justin?\n\nIIRC that was revealed at the Country Club party. How exactly did that all come about?\n\nHis mother was either Jackie or Elizabeth. IIRC Phillip was raised thinking Jackie was mom but it was really Elizabeth??\n\nHow did all that go down?\n\nIt's been so long ago it's fuzzy.\n\nR389 I think P&G just panicked for a bit since GL was so dominating for decades then started slipping when some new, upstart soaps starting rising in the ratings at the same time. I think the quality of the show was there so they knew it wasn't that. Panic set in and they figured it had to be because the show was older so they wanted to find a way to make it hip. Afterall, so many of the older soaps were failing but none of them quite had the domination GL had for decades. In hindsight, it was just in a bit of an ebb, it had a very loyal fan base so there was no need to panic. The younger shows would have to stand on their own, grab a loyal fan base or they wouldn't last long. I'm sure some network idiot claimed credit for dropping \"the\" when GL remained stable. LOL\n\nr391, fragile Elizabeth gave birth to a stillborn while in Switzerland. Her husband Alan, wanting an heir, arranged with his friend Dr. Paul Lacrosse to replace his dead son with the newborn of another of Lacrosse's patients, Jackie Marler. Jackie had fled to Switzerland after finding her husband Justin in bed with another woman (who was played by Jobeth Williams, btw). Jackie found out she was pregnant and vindictively gave the child over to Lacrosse because she wanted nothing to do with Justin. She told Justin she had an abortion. She came to regret her actions and made friends with Elizabeth to be close to her child. Elizabeth was kept in the dark for years that Phillip was not her biological son; Alan had no idea who Phillip's real parents were. When he divorced Elizabeth, he married Jackie who had hoped she could finally be Phillip's \"mother\" by being his stepmother and not having to upset the apple cart by revealing the truth. However, the court awarded custody of Phillip to Liz. Justin had discovered Phillip was his child when a delirious Jackie, who miscarried Alan's baby, revealed the truth to him. Justin married Liz, whose relationship with the man she loved - Mike Bauer - was ruined by Alan's campaign to poison Phillip's mind against Mike. After sleeping with Mike, Liz ended her marriage to Justin when she overheard Justin telling Mike that Phillip was not her biological son. Justin and Jackie confirmed it, and she ran off to Switzerland to undergo extensive therapy, leaving Phillip in their care. By then, Ross also knew, but kept it a secret for Justin. Jackie and Justin remarried and became surrogate parents for Phillip, who loved them both as his one-time stepparents. A renewed Liz decided the Marlers should have custody of Phillip, and then took off for Switzerland never to be seen again. Phillip was kept in the dark about his lineage while going back and forth between the Marler and Spaulding households. When vile Bradley Raines found out Alan's secret, he blackmailed him but couldn't help but finally reveal the truth to Phillip during a vicious confrontation. This is when Phillip found out that he was Justin and Jackie's son.\n\n[quote]OMG, you soap fans are pathetic. Discussing 35-40 year old storylines.\n\nThis is the same board that has an annual Auntie Mame thread. That still discusses plots about Golden Girls, I Love Lucy, Will and Grace, and Designing Women. This is the same board that used to dissect the plots of Love Boat and how they were duplicative of Love American Style plots.\n\nSo you have the nerve to pick on soap fans who discuss some old stories and plots?\n\nDo you not know where you are?\n\nSo discuss it, r420. The great thing about this thread is that there should be someone who will want to engage in that conversation with you. Meanwhile, the late 70s \"crap\" can continue to be a source of interest for others, which, judging from the thread, is a considerable source oif interest for many people. But that doesn't mean you have to engage in the conversation - make your own posts and encourage others to talk with you instead of stamping your feet on the ground when things aren't going your way.\n\nIt's like a party. There are people talking over there. There are people talking over here. Conversations vary and flourish simultaneously. Something for everyone.\n\nr404, someone on this thread suggested that Olivia should have turned out to be Rita's daughter with Ed. That would have been a GREAT idea. Olivia was so much like Rita in many ways.\n\nI had a fantasy scenario where Fletcher returned to town and brought his new wife, who turned out to be Rita.\n\nJoe Willmore was going to bring Kasdorf back to GL in 86 (along with ELvera Roussell as Hope) to re-ignite the Bauer-Spaulding war, but for whatever reason, the plans fell through. In the 90s, when Michael Laibsen was bringing 80s faves back to the canvas (Reva, Nola, Amanda), speculation was that Rita may be the next one to return. Lenore Kasdorf responded to the rumour in SOD saying she hadn't been approached, but was all but willing to make a return. I don't know why we never her again; I can only guess there may have been two reasons:\n\n1) having Reva and Rita in the same town would be too much for a writer to juggle.\n\n2) having TWO of Roger's rape victims in town would be hard for a writer to work with. Holly's rape was hard enough to deal with - how could they try and explain Roger raping Rita as well?\n\nYes r426, Roger violently raped Rita soon after she became engaged to Ed. She was terrified how Ed would react so she kept the incident a secret.\n\nLater, when Roger was charged with raping Holly, Rita struggled with her conscience to reveal the rape to help Holly's case but chose to keep quiet. When she finally did reveal what Roger did to her, it was at the 11th hour and led to a series of tragic events that made GL history: Ed was so angry that he beat Roger to a pulp, and Holly was so traumatized she grabbed a gun and shot Roger when Roger gained the upper hand; Roger blackmailed Alan to help him fake his death and Holly was sent to prison for his murder, which eventually led to Roger returning to terrorize both Rita and Holly - he kidnapped a pregnant Rita and held her in a cabin where she ended up being trapped in a fire while tied to the bed and miscarrying Ed's baby; Roger then kidnapped Holly and dragged her through the jungles of Santo Domingo, where he eventually \"died\".\n\nThe 90s continuation of the Holly-Roger saga played it that Holly was always the source of Roger's obsession; the story completely ignored the obsession he had for Rita, who represented his baser sexual instincts. 90s Roger was glamourized as the town anti-hero - dealing with his rape of Holly was heady enough; bringing back yet another woman he stalked, terrorised and raped would interfere with the soapy playing down of his past as a serial rapist and misogynist. I am convinced this is why we never saw Rita Bauer again.\n\nThe \"Enough is Enough\" sequence was when Roger, thought dead after being shot by Holly, returned to kidnap his daughter; Rita recognized him in disguise at the carnival, prompting him to kidnap her. She was pregnant with Ed's baby at the time. Roger kept her tied to a bed in a cabin in the woods. Mike and Ed located her, Roger panicked and ran, knocking a kerosene lamp over and setting fire to the cabin, leaving Rita to die in the flames. The smoke inhalation caused Rita to miscarry her baby later in the hospital.\n\nRoger also caused the death of the plastic surgeon he was romancing in Paris; the woman fell for him but came to fear him when she learned about his criminal past. He came to her to force her to help him escape Mike. She ran from him and fell down a flight of stairs, breaking her neck.\n\n[R416] Beth Ehlers did not \"flounder\" upon her return to Guiding Light, she saved the show from cancellation. Her return drove the ratings up more than a full point. CBS was itching to cancel GL after they cancelled the show in 1995, only to have P&G threaten to never advertise on CBS again. CBS uncancelled GL and announced an exclusive advertising deal with P&G. In 1997, when GL celebrated its 60th anniversary, P&G had a new CEO who wanted to get out of the soap opera business. Because GL was the only soap to gain viewers that year, CBS renewed it. Beth Ehlers was still GL's most popular actress when she left the show in 2008.\n\nI always thought Aleksander met his wife while on GL as a recurring character (in the Rose and Rusty story), but if they met in college that makes their relationship even more \"unHollywood\" considering they are still together and have been since their early 20s.\n\nThey have no children, but live with tons of rescue cats and dogs. They are virulent PETA activists. She quit acting years ago and went into law; she is now assistant district attorney in New Jersey.\n\nAleksander returned to school after GL ended to finish his theatre major as a kind of promise to his late parents. He attended classes at Washington and Lee, and started teaching theatre. Imagine seeing him walking around campus as a hot daddy.\n\nHe was a natural actor for the soap medium in that he feels more comfortable as part of an ensemble and working off other actors. He may have held a leading role on a soap for over 20 years, but he really does have the theatre spirit in him (many actors on GL did). He had bit parts on prime-time shows during his breaks from GL (Who's The Boss, Hardcastle & McCormack, The Fall Guy), tried a couple of other soaps and characters for a break from Phillip (villains on Capitol and AMC), but GL gave him the theatre domain he is more at home in.\n\nMy job gave me an indirect tie to the Daytime Emmys in 2009; Grant and most of the GL cast came out to the show to take a bow.\n\nI got to meet him and he couldn't have been more gracious and kind. He sensed I was a fan of the show, and probably his, too.\n\nHe's a good guy.\n\nYou sometimes don't want to meet people you like because they let you down -- or maybe you just catch them on that one bad day.\n\nR453 I've shared this before here several times, so ppl have read this before...\n\nI was at an event at a restaurant in NYC that featured Grant and several other actors. After dinner, I went to the restroom as I needed to pee.\n\nI realized as I was walking up to the available urinal that the very tall man using the next one over (the only other one) was indeed Grant.\n\nHe was talking to a friend who was washing his hands (who probably pissed where I was, and had finished). He was looking back at this guy and was obviously involved in the conversation.\n\nI usually take just a lightning-quick peek, but my eye was drawn to take a more direct look because it was so big. It was enormous even flaccid. It looked as sizeable soft as many dicks I've seen hard, in terms of length and thickness. It did have a bit of that \"torpedo\" look (A bit thinner closer to the head.) I made a point to look for as long as I could.\n\nI make no suggestions that he knew I was looking, or that he was showing off, or anything like that. But I have probably spilled a few dozen loads thinking about what an amazing cock he had.\n\nI find vegetarians have that look when they age. He was always sharply defined in his angular features, but a non-meat diet will only sharpen and accentuate those angularities as one ages, and get that \"sickly gaunt\" look. Still, he has taken exceptional care of himself all his life, and although he does look his age, he is still a hot guy.\n\nRamsey was always a little mousy. I find that combo of hot guy and mousy girl to be quite common.\n\n[quote]And with that pleasant exchange, here is more Aleksander Prime A+ beefcake ... Phillip parades around the apartment in nothing but tight little shorts while Rick tries very hard to pretend he doesn't want his best buddy to rip his asshole a new one:\n\nScenes like that were both exhilarating and nerve-wracking for me when they aired. I started watching GL with my mother when I was in middle school, in the throes of puberty. I convinced myself I had a crush on Mindy Lewis, but those shirtless scenes with Phillip always had a greater physical effect on me. :-) I distinctly remember a shirtless scene with Philip where he's wearing just a towel and he's blow-drying his hair. As the camera zoomed in, all you could see was his face and his armpits. I swear that scene awakened a sexual interest that I had no idea about previously.\n\nJudi and Grant got along OK at first.\n\nJudi had a falling out with most of the cast (especially Grant, Krista Tesreau and Mikey O'Leary) after she began dating one of the producers, won the Emmy and started to have multiple stories built around her.\n\nJudi seems nice enough, but she was young and inexperienced and I assume she didn't handle all that power well, nor did her costars handle their jealousy well.\n\nI believe she was let out of her contract six months early because of the intensity of the conflict on set. By that time even John Bolger was involved.\n\nShe didn't marry the producer, though, he eventually left.\n\nSt. Beth was an archetypal character - the good girl from the different side of the tracks that represented what was fine and pure outside the more jaded characters, even with her youth expended as a tormented, incest victim. She was the shining gem amidst even the most brutal reality. Her strength and courage was enlightening rather than threatening or complex. Complexity used to be reserved for self-destructive characters or traditional villains; now it is the norm. You don't get Beth Raines characters anymore - everybody is a jaded character. GH's attempt with the gag-inducing Sabrina the nurse was farcical in the face of today's customary cynicism.\n\nBut even then, Beth was a bit too much for some viewers. Every man loved her. Even perrenial good boy Floyd Parker went beserk and uncharacteristically turned into a cowardly murderer because of his unrequited love for her! Most of us cheered bitchy India on every time she railed against \"saintly\" Beth and shared her exasperation at the free pass Beth always got.\n\nBefore Judi left the show, Beth and Phillip moved in together so I think it is clear they slept together.\n\nAlthough many stories did have Beth in them and all the men went bonkers for her, I don't think she hogged the screen. GL was pretty balanced during this time.\n\nI think everyone loved India's bitchiness at other characters. Her railing against Beth was never mean spirited and was always out of jealousy (for lack of a better word) that Phillip put Beth on such a pedestal like she was a Mayan God. LOL.\n\nThey initially played it that Alexandra and Warren were all about S-E-X. That he had some kind of sexual hold over her she couldn't resist. There was subtext that he was more like her brother Alan than her other suitor Ross Marler was, so she eventually fell for Warren. They really should have developed a Ross-Alex-Warren story out and had Alex corrupt Ross - or \"recorrupt\" him, making more of a long-term couple of Alex and Ross. They dropped that story to concentrate more on the younger generation of paulding.\n\nHere's some afternoon delight for Alex and Warren - twice:\n\nI'm watching some episodes from November 1981 on YT and realize that:\n\na) Douglas Marland's dialogue is really quite bad if it weren't for the actors doing their best with it;\n\nb) compared to the trampy, scrapper she was when she first tried to steal Kelly from Morgan, I really don't like the kooky, airheaded Nola that was paired with the ridiculous - and I mean RIDICULOUS - Quinton McCord;\n\nc) Jane Elliot as Carrie Todd was quite charming, and she exhibits the only sexual chemistry she ever has with a leading man in her entire soap career with Jerry ver Dorn.\n\nI don't think Phillip/Harley worked on many levels except as friends.\n\nIt was very smart to put Phillip/Beth back together which produced James and gave some good fall out.\n\nI don't think James Rebhorn would have come back to GL to have a major story since he was kind of a big deal filming countless big roles all the time. Though I do think he would have made a cameo which they should have done when they killed him off.\n\n[quote]I don't think Phillip/Harley worked on many levels except as friends.\n\nThey never should have been paired.\n\nEnough of the viewing audience were glad to have Beth Ehlers back, and they had a willingness to fill in the holes by accepting Harley with another guy that was not Mallet (because the offscreen relationship between Ehlers and Mark Derwin didn't last).\n\nHarley and Phillip looked like they could be biologically related. The visual of those two, as a couple, was not pleasant.\n\nI've told this story on other threads but for this one it bears repeating:\n\nIn 1983 my bf was a day player on GL. He was friendly with Chris Bernau from their theater days. He was standing around on the set with him when Grant sauntered in, walked past Chris and my bf, walked over to Chris, put his hand on hiss shoulder and said \"I'm off to take a nap in my dressing room, Chris. I've had one hell of a night at The Glory Hole.\" He then walked to his dressing room. My bf's jaw dropped, Chris smirked. My bf was set \"straight\" about Grant. Chris had apparently told Grant's stories about his sexual past and The Glory Hole figured into them. He would head there right after performing onstage in The Passion of Dracula.\n\nGrant and Philip McGregor, who joined the show with him as Rick Bauer, remained very good friends. Philip was from a well-off family on the Upper West Side and started off doing extra work in movies and commercials. You can see him for a brief moment in the movie Manhattan in front of the Dalton School where Mariel Hemingway's character goes. I knew Philip briefly and he was a sweet yet shallow kid who, according to several mutual friends, gave an absolutely fantastic blow job. I have a feeling Grant might have enjoyed these from time to time. I saw Philip on the street a few months ago and he still looks pretty good. I'm sure he left the business years ago, which makes sense be cause he was an awful actor.\n\nr526, it kind of depends on the guy. Alot of straight guys get an ego thing out of \"teasing\", \"flirting\" with gay guys, knowing full well it won't ever happen. Some of them are closeted/curious. Some of them are being just downright douchey. But I think humour is a safe way for many to retain their masculine composure while intermingling with \"the homosexual\".\n\nAs long as they don't feel the need to beat the shit out of anyone for being gay, I have no problem with the \"teasing\". It is kind of a guy thing anyway. Straight guys rag on one another all the time.\n\nIn Grant and Chris' case, I get the impression that GA was just having some fun with Bernau.\n\nr525 Are you saying that Philliip McGregor is gay in real life? You sort of imply that, but don't outright say it.\n\nFor those five months he played Rick, I kept wondering if they were going to make the character gay.\n\nMcGregor was certainly cute when he was cast, but was never a really strong actor. He was vastly weaker than Grant. I've often wondered if they had cast a stronger actor from the get-go, whether Rick would have been a more central character on the show, rather than the perpetual sidekick. Michael O'Leary always came off as a goofball anyway, so he just continued the sidekick status that McGregor originated.\n\nMany years ago Soap Classics started selling DVDs of classic episodes from GL & AW.\n\nThe Bauer DVD set was never released. Someone on eBay (bulldogtradingcompany) has 9 sets of the unopened Bauer DVDs. There are 11 episodes in all.\n\nThe first DVD are classic Bauer episodes. For example: Bert losing her leg.\n\nThe second DVD are classic episodes of the Bauer BBQ.\n\nI'm on my phone and I'm having trouble linking to the actual eBay item.\n\nYou can search eBay with \"GL DVD The Bauer Family Story 11 Episodes\" or the seller \"bulldogtradingcompany\"\n\nEach episode is described and listed with its airdate.\n\nHere's the info on the two disc Bauer Collection set:\n\nThe Bauer family first appeared on the 15-minute radio version of THE GUIDING LIGHT in 1948. The family moved with the show to television in 1952 (also continuing on radio until 1956). They remained central as the show moved its setting to Springfield, expanded to 30 minutes and then 60, and from black and white to color. This collection covers a span of episodes from 1973 to 2009. The episodes are divided into two discs: * Disc 1, \"Meet the Bauers\", features six pivotal episodes in the history of the family, including a rare \"bonus\" episode from 1973. * Disc Two, \"Bauer Barbecues\" contains five of the family's traditional Independence Day gatherings (the Barbecues are one of the top requests from GL fans).\n\nDisc 1: Meet the Bauers\n\n1. \"Man of the Year\", November 14, 1977 (one of the shows first one-hour episodes) 2. \"Where in the World is Santo Domingo, March 19, 1980 (Roger Thorpe has kidnapped Holly. Filmed in Santo Domingo. 3. \"Courage\", June 27, 1984 ( a moving episode where Bert Bauer loses one of her legs reflecting what actress Charita Bauer went through in real life). 4. \"The Return\", Nov. 22, 1996 (Mary Stuart, former star of \"Search for Tomorrow\" debuts as the new Meta Bauer. 5. \"Death of a Patriarch\", Feb. 27, 1973 (the lost episode where Papa Bauer has died). This also comes with the original network commercials!!!!\n\nDisc 2: The Bauer Barbecues\n\n6. \"Unexpected Arrival\", July 2, 1987 7. \"Dueling Barbecues\", July 4, 1994 8. \"Party Crasher\", July 4, 1997 9. \"America The Beautiful\", July 4, 2002 10. \"One Last Time\", July 3, 2009\n\nit is steep but I think the shipping's free...I never know when youtube's going to shut down all their soap stuff so I'm thinking about getting one...over 5 years later it's still so strange that the show isn't here anymore.\n\nI moved across country in the 80s and it was very comforting that I could turn on the TV and see my GL 'pals'.\n\nThe show became so unwatchable with all the san Cristobel stuff and the Santos clan. as far as finales went viewers got a lot of happy endings, at least.\n\nI don't know if he submitted himself for the Emmys the year that Phillip took over Spaulding Enterprises from Alan.\n\nIt culminated with him on the floor of the country club, by himself with a bottle of champagne (only an unseen Harley viewed him from a distance). \"Try and disown me now, dad\" Phillip said at the end. Amazing story. Great acting.\n\nNot sure how old he was back then but maybe he could have been eligible for younger leading actor, but honestly he should have won for lead actor.\n\nR543 writes,\n\n[quote]The Younger Actor/Actress category of the Daytime Emmys did not start until 1985. I believe the age cutoff was 25. At one point over the years, they lowered it to 21, but raised it back to 25 a few years later.\n\nThat categorical level was a joke. Within the first five years, there were at least three actors at the age of 30 in the year of their nomination: Don Scardino (1986), Debbi Morgan (1986), and Andrea Evans (1988). There weren't any standards back then. Around 1989 or 1990 marked the point in which the Academy started doing age cut-offs. But the system was still gamed.\n\nActors have age ranges and Charita's was that of a matronly grandmother. Ellen Parker's Maureen played older. I think the show would have sustained Maureen's death more if it had simply brought Elvera Roussel back as Hope to play that motherly 'talk to.'\n\nThat episode posted by R576 is wonderful! The actor playing the d.a. went on to play Marsha Talbot's cousin on ATWT and was an instrumental role in the conclusion of the Doug Cummings storyline. The woman playing Alicia Rhomer was excellent! Love where she goes from snapping at her crew (which appears to include GL producer Bobby Kochman, I think?) and then she goes into the demure \"hello...\" once she goes on camera. Betty Rea, the casting director, found not only wonderful contract players, but excellent actors to do day player stuff, too.\n\nThat's right, R579. They did, and it was a great move on GL's part. It only took P&G 10 years to realize that Mary Stuart still have value.\n\nPam Long and Gail Kobe, the team that gave us that great year of 1984 with GL, really cut out a lot of the Bauers; when they were done, we had Ed, Rick and Maureen, and Ed's daughter with Claire....that didn't seem like enough. By the time Meta came on she couldn't tell Abby from Michelle...I just watched some classic ATWT -- Christmas 1985 (yes, 30 years ago!) And it was all about family. God Bless 'em, they propped up Don McLaughlin in a chair as Chris and you had him and Nancy, Bob and Kim, Tom and Margo, and Andy and Frannie...it was Frannie's birthday; the love in the room was overflowing. Who wouldn't want to have family like that?\n\nIt was tough watching soaps do away with all of that over the years.\n\nShortly after Search for Tomorrow was canceled at the end of 1986, Mary Stuart did an interview and mentioned that P&G planned to move her over to Guiding Light playing a character named Hannah Bauer. Mary Stuart didn't elaborate more than that, but presumably, she would have been the grandmother of Johnny Bauer who arrived in Springfield about that same time, as did his sister Lacey Bauer, (who was in town just a few months before being written off).\n\nObviously Hannah Bauer never happened. But it does seem bizarre that P&G waited a decade to finally bring Stuart to GL. Never knew they made Mary Stuart audition before casting her as Meta.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong R585; I'm a BIG Pam Long fan.\n\nShe wrote MEN -- Billy, Alan, Phillip -- she had dynamics between men. They didn't just argue over the same women as on most soaps. I know everyone loves the Rick/Phillip dynamic, but I really enjoyed the Phillip Alan-Michael one; Carl Evans wasn't the best actor, but I think he worked well with Grant.\n\nThere was a scene in the Spaulding dining room in which AM let Phillip know he knew that Phillip was the father of Meredith's baby. AM blasted an overprotective Phillip with: \"You want to be my 'Daddy.' You want to take care of me.\"\n\nI couldn't believe that they got that on the air."
