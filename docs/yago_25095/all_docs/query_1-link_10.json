        "text": "The early to mid-1990s were a great time for TPTB at Guiding Light overall. They were very aware of using the show’s history and long term relationships to create new story. They were also very aware of the scope of the canvas, looking proactively for gaps and holes and worked at actively filling them. It was the fact the real life Harlett (Harley Cooper – A.C. Mallet) couple decided to leave the show to try their luck in LA that made TPTB decide they needed a new ingenue and invented a new Cooper, a long lost daughter that Buzz had never mentioned before. Casting right then tended to either be brilliant, amazing, and spot on or terrible, bad, milquetoast. Sonia Satra who played Lucy was a great example of the Spot On category who not only seamlessly filled the hole Harley left behind, but provided a much more social vibe, quickly establishing connections all over the canvas. Lucy is one of the soap roles I really can’t imagine anyone else playing as well.\n\nLucy Cooper – Buzz Cooper had felt trapped in Springfield with the constant demands of the family diner and his early marriage to his high school sweetheart and quick arrival of his two kids. Buzz felt a little relieved when he was drafted to go to Viet Nam. While there Buzz won a purple heart for saving his unit by shooting an American solider who had gone nuts under battle field strain and starting shooting his own unit. Buzz felt a huge amount of guilt over this so when he was mustered out he went to talk to the man’s widow. The whole experience caused her to miscarry. Instead of returning to his own family he stayed with this woman and ultimately they had Lucy. The Widow died and Buzz raised Lucy on the road moving from town to town and being sort of borderline cons always with a get rich quick scheme. Lucy had been on her own waitressing for over a year when we meet her, but Buzz had set up an emergency fund for her which they called her trustfund. After Lucy was fired for standing up fro herself when she was sexually harassed by a customer at her job she planned to take the emergency fund and start on a new life, but instead discovered Buzz (who had reunited with his first family) had emptied the account (he used it to pay for Harley’s wedding).\n\nThe first Springfielder Lucy met was Alan-Michael Spaudling and they quickly bonded. Lucy very early on declared her intention to marry A-M. While their romance hit roadblocks, they started working together right away forming a strong and deep friendship and business partnership. Although she really hadn’t done any professional business work before she seemed to naturally excel at being an administrative assistant. Lucy always say the best in people, but sadly people consistently let her down. Her most memorial story was her being date raped by Spaulding executive Brent Lawrence. Lawrence who had MAJOR psychological issues due to his mother’s abuse when he was growing up and blamed Lucy for ultimately pressing charges. Brent physically attacked Lucy and A-M and was ultimately severely wounded and assumed dead. Instead his sister nursed him back to health and he returned in drag as Marian Crane getting a job at Spaulding as a woman and befriending Lucy. Brent began a career of psychological torture. He killed Nadine Cooper and longtime SFPD detective Patrick Cutter and a random guy on the dock as colloatoral damage. He ended up kidnapping Lucy and A-M and held them at the lighthouse. It was partially destroyed in the process requiring the restoration and repair that climaxed as part of the 1997 anniversary storyline. Buzz and Alan first forged their love-hate relathionship as they worked together to save their children.\n\nLucy and A-M had their happily ever after wedding at the Universal theme park in Florida. Sadly most of the end of their run on the show wasn’t really about them. The actors had decided to leave and Harley was brought back to fill the gap. Phillip also came back first showing his face at their wedding and erased all the progress the brother had made in the early 1990s as they once again assumed very adversarial roles. Another LAM storyline about then had them starting and thankfully aborting a blatant rip-off of The Preacher’s Wife which was a minor movie hit about then which wouldn’t have fit with their characters at all. (The angel in this case being Zachary Smith.) LAM left town together to take Spaulding Europe to new heights. When a new and much less astute group of TPTB brought A-M back in 2005 they had de-SORASed him and had LAM divorce off screen. As this was clearly a plot, not character driven story that did it’s best to destroy A-M hopefully it can just be mercifully erased from memory and we can assume A-M had just had a bad reaction to meds or something and they had reunited off screen.\n\nI have always believed that Harley and A-M were truly soulmates, but I believe that A-M was the only true love of Lucy’s life and that they belonged together. I think A-M would have had a better life with Lucy as they were much more of a team since Harley refused to act as a team player and Lucy excelled at it.\n\nLucy had left town before Danny came to town and unfortunately she had little contact with Michelle. This was a mistake though because she’d have been a good influence and since they were even tied together as both being one of angel Zachary Smith’s “cases” and there would have been lots of opportunities. A-M and Michelle were also cousins and some of the most close Bauer cousins when they were younger although they allowed them to drift about after Maureen’s death and Michelle’s SORASing. So there should have been a strong connection.\n\nThe Spauldingfield character profile had a few errors. First, for she remains convinced that Eleni’s name is spelled Elani. Second, Lucy actually met Harley the first day she came to town although they didn’t really realize who the other one was, they did meet and it was suggested that they talked regularly off screen during Lucy’s time there. It also has a lot of early Matt so Mattessa fans should enjoy it.\n\nThe Beginning of LAM\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2013/01/27/lucy-and-alan-michael-beginning\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
