        "text": "Where the Heart Lies\n\nThis takes place 6 years from now and James and Daisy are engaged; in a couple of months will be married.

Will Daisy fall back into Foley's trap for her or will she stay with the guy she is meant to be with a Spaulding.\n\nCharacters include: Daisy Lemay, James Spaulding, Lizzie Lewis, Bill Lewis, Phillip Spaulding, Beth Spaulding, Reva Shayne Lewis, Josh Lewis, Billy Lewis, Matt Reardon, Vanessa Reardon, Dylan Lewis, Bridget Reardon Lewis, Ashlee Wolf, Cyrus Foley, Grady Foley, Buzz Cooper, Marina Lewis, Shayne Lewis, Frank Cooper, Christina Boudreau, Remy Boudreau, Rick Bauer and Riley Lewis, with special appearances of Harley Cooper, Zach Spaulding, Emma Spaulding, Alexandra Spaulding, Alan-Michael Spaulding, Lucy Cooper, and Peter Reardon Lewis.\n\nAuthor's Note: Okay so this is my first guiding light fan fiction and I have to say I will really miss GL every afternoon at 3pm. It was my first soap opera that I ever watched at the age of 7 with my mom and I have grown up with it for the last 15 years. I love James and Daisy together, though there are probably a lot of people who could care less about this couple or the characters either way. Please no bashing, because this is just my imagination and my writing. Enjoy the story. Also I do not own any of the characters except for Riley Lewis (Bill and Lizzie's daughter)\n\nIt had been almost 6 years since they had met yet again, 6 years since he started pursuing her, 6 years since she had given in and opened herself to someone else after Grady \"left\" her. In those 6 years their love blossomed from young love to true love and respect for each other. Daisy and James were a couple that most people didn't think would make it. She was a Cooper and he was a Spaulding that paring alone was bound to go up in flames. Considering her mother was once married to his father and her aunt was married to his uncle just proved that Coopers and Spaulding's just did not mix well at all. Luckily for them their relationship turned out much better than that of Harley and Phillip and Alan-Michael and Lucy. James and Daisy first started out as just friends though at times she couldn't stand him and just thought he was an arrogant Spaulding like the rest of his family. Yet that mind frame changed after he had paid her way as well as Ashlee and Christina's way to Florida when his granddad Alan tried to stop Bill and Lizzie from getting engaged and their friendship bloomed from there. Unfortunately obstacles stood in their way, mainly the number one problem was Alan Spaulding. Now that Alan had passed away after saving Phillip's life with a high-risk bone marrow transplant James wasn't under his granddad's subtle control and didn't have to worry about him sabotaging his relationship with Daisy.\n\nWhen they became an official couple their parents were cautious but happy for them. Phillip and Beth were probably the more enthusiastic of the two sets of parents. Dylan and Bridget were a little wary because of what they had known of the Spauldings, but once they saw that things had really changed since Alan's death they came to realize that it was Alan's power over the family that made them what they were, not who they were now. Harley was not happy about the fact that her daughter was dating her ex-husband's son but decided that Daisy was an adult and could date anyone she wanted to.\n\nAfter officially dating for 6 years James had finally gotten up the courage to propose to the girl that made his life feel complete. He had taken Daisy on the Spaulding jet out to Newport Beach to the family's beach house for a long weekend and had proposed to her at sunset on their last day there. Daisy excitedly agreed and began to cry as James slipped a simple white gold 2 carat diamond ring onto her left ring finger. They decided to wait and gather their families and friends at Company and tell them the news. On the way back to Springfield James and Daisy had called his sister Lizzie and her husband Bill and asked them to gather Beth, Phillip, Josh, Reva, Billy, Buzz, Frank, Cyrus, Marina, Shayne, Dylan and Bridget and get them to meet at Company at 2pm.\n\nOnce the plane landed the newly engaged couple took the long way to Company to give everyone a chance to get there and to spend a little more time together their engagement still just between the two of them. As they pulled up to Company Daisy took a deep breath.\n\n\"We don't have to tell them now if you don't want to\" James said taking her hand in his and giving it a slight squeeze. \"We can just keep it to ourselves for a little while longer.\"\n\n\"I don't think when I see Ashlee and Christina they will ignore the beautiful diamond on my finger cause I don't plan on taking it off ever\" Daisy said turning to him. \"Besides your sister was practically going to explode over the phone when we told her we had big news to tell everyone.\"\n\n\"Yeah she did seem pretty eager to know didn't she\" James laughed as the image of his much smaller older sister busting with suspense.\n\nDaisy opened the car door and began to get out, \"Guess its now or never\" she said as the two of them got out of James's car and started walking into Company. Just before entering the hometown restaurant James took Daisy's hand and held tightly to it. She smiled up at his and gave him a quick kiss before they opened the door and walked in.\n\n\"Okay we got everyone here\" Lizzie said excitedly jumping up at the sight of her brother and Daisy walking in, \"What's going on\"\n\n\"Oh my god your pregnant aren't you\" Frank Cooper said from the counter.\n\n\"She better not be\" Dylan said from his place by Bridget and Reva at a table near the back wall.\n\n\"Calm down dad, you too Uncle Frank.\" Daisy said rolling her eyes slightly.\n\n\"She's not pregnant\" James stated calmly, \"But what we have to say will definitely affect all of you one way or another.\"\n\n\"Come on out with it all ready\" Josh said good heartedly, \"We're not getting any younger you know\" he added there by receiving a nudge in the ribs by his wife.\n\nDaisy untangled her hand from James's and held it up to show off the sparkling diamond. \"We're getting married\" she said happily.\n\nReactions were different from everyone. Some were jumping up and down with excitement while others remained calm with smiles on their faces.\n\nBeth was the first to come up to the happy couple with Phillip by her side. \"Congratulations honey\" she said taking James's face in her hands and giving him a kiss on the cheek before turning to Daisy and hugging the young girl.\n\nPhillip shook his son's hand before hugging him briefly, \"Welcome to the family Daisy\" he said hugging her.\n\n\"Thanks mom, thanks dad\" James said snaking an arm around Daisy's waist.\n\nLizzie was next, jumping up into her brother's arms hugging him tightly, \"You sneak, you know you could have told me.\"\n\n\"No I couldn't have\" James said with a smirk, \"You can't keep a secret to save your life.\"\n\n\"I kind of have to agree with my brother in-law on that one honey\" Bill said coming up behind his wife shaking James's hand, \"You really can't keep a secret. It would have made it onto the Springfield afternoon news before they even got here.\"\n\nLizzie just shook her head and turned to Daisy, \"Oh I am so excited about this, we have to start planning as soon as possible.\"\n\nDaisy laughed as the petite blond began listing off things that needed to be done before the wedding.\n\nDylan and Bridget were the next up to congratulate the happy couple. \"Do I have to give the whole if your hurt my daughter I'm coming after you speech\" Dylan asked James while Bridget was congratulating Daisy.\n\n\"No sir. I will take good care of her, promise\" James said sincerely.\n\nDylan hugged the young man and slapped a hand on his shoulder and said, \"I know you will.\"\n\n\"Alright I'm not going to give you a big speech about taking care of my granddaughter and if you hurt her blah blah blah and so on\" Buzz said coming up to James, \"But I will say just welcome to the family again so to speak if you want to get technical.\"\n\n\"Thanks Buzz\" James said. He had always had a soft spot for Buzz since he was seeing his nana Lillian and had treated him like his own person. He felt like Buzz had been the only real grandfather to him unlike Alan who just tried to control him.\n\n\"Oh my baby is getting married\" Reva said to Daisy hugging her tightly before turning to James and doing the same. \"And to a fine young man as it is.\"\n\n\"Anyone is better than Grady Foley\" Frank piped up quickly as Marina and Shayne offered their congratulations to the happy couple, \"No offense to you Cyrus\"\n\n\"None taken mate\" Cyrus said in his thick Australian accent, \"Besides Grady wasn't my real brother so to speak.\"\n\n\"So when's the wedding you two crazy kids\" Billy asked from the back of the room.\n\n\"We haven't decided yet\" James said looking down at Daisy.\n\n\"Maybe something in the fall\" Daisy said shrugging slightly as if quietly asking James his opinion who in return nodded.\n\n\"Oh a fall wedding\" Lizzie clapped happily. \"That's not too far away. We have to figure out what month and actual day though\"\n\nJames thought for a moment, \"What about November eighth\" he suggested.\n\n\"November eighth\" Daisy repeated, \"I like it\" she said with a smile as she leaned up to kiss him.\n\n\"Perfect now that we've got that out of the way, we have to book a preacher, get you a dress, flowers, food, music, a location.\" Lizzie rambled off.\n\n\"Calm down Lizzie\" Bridget laughed, \"We've got at least 7 months before hand to work on all of that.\"\n\n\"I think she's more excited than I am if that's possible\" Daisy giggled.\n\n\"No\" Lizzie said quickly, \"I just love a wedding that's all and besides this is my brother's wedding and I want everything to be perfect.\"\n\n\"It will be honey\" Phillip said from his place beside Beth. \"Just take a deep breath and relax\"\n\nEveryone laughed at this comment and the discussion on the wedding continued as a figure loomed outside of Company. Running a hand through his scraggly long brown hair he shook his head. She was marrying a Spaulding, James Spaulding no less. He and she had had a connection before he was suddenly thrown out of the picture. Now he was back to win back the woman who had taken his heart and who he had inadvertedly and for the most part purposely broken hers.\n\n\"We will see about a wedding\" Grady Foley said from outside Company, \"This is one engagement that will not last very long.\n\n(Okay so let me know what you think, Good, bad, sucky, whatever should I continue. Feedback is greatly appreciated as well as advise on what to go in the chapters as well. Everything will be taken into consideration. Thanks again)"
