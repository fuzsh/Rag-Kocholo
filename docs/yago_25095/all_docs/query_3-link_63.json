        "text": "Details\n\n39 letters : typescript facsimiles\n\n1806-1864\n\nFacsimile typescripts of letters by Zina Baker Huntington and various family members. The letters from Zina Huntington were written to her parents, Dr. Oliver and Dorcas Baker (later Spalding), and stepfather Captain Phillip Spalding from 1806 to 1829. They begin shortly after Zina's marriage to William Huntington and the couple's move from New Hampshire to Watertown, New York. Zina writes to her parents of her daily activities, family life (including the birth of her children), news of family and acquaintances, and of the death of her father. She also comments on religious revivals. Included in these letters are messages from Zina's husband William and his sister, Prescendia Huntington (1794-1887). Other letters include those from Zina's brother Oliver Baker (1788-1865) to their mother from 1815-1822, a letter from Dorcas Baker's niece Miranda Dimock (1823) in which Miranda writes of the deaths of several family members, a letter from Dorcas' daughter Elizabeth Dumkee (undated), a letter from William Huntington to Oliver Baker (1807), and a letter from Carpenter Dillingham to Phillip Spalding (1828) in which Dillingham writes of a land lawsuit between E. Cobb and Z. Brown. Also included are photocopies of several original letters from Zina's son Chauncey Dyer Huntington to his brother Dimmock Baker Huntington (1863?) and his sister Zina D.H. Jacobs Smith Young (dated 1854-1864). Chauncey writes of family news, his views on the Civil War and the Copperhead movement, his belief that giving women the right to vote would end the practice of polygamy, and his message to Zina after the family's conversion to Mormonism that \"I love you all just as dearly as though you had embraced a popular religion, or none at all.\".\n\nZina Baker Huntington was born in Plainfield, New Hampshire, on May 2, 1786. Her parents were Dr. Oliver Baker (1755-1811), who was one of the first practicing physicians in New Hampshire, and Dorcas Dimock (1760-1849), who married Revolutionary War veteran Captain Phillip Spalding (1755-1847) in 1822. Zina married William Huntington, Jr. (1784-1846) in New Hampshire in 1805, and moved with him to Watertown, New York, in 1806. William, who was a nephew of Declaration of Independence signer Samuel Huntington, engaged in farming and fought in the War of 1812. Zina and William were baptized into the newly founded Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1835, and in 1836 moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where William was a charter member of the Kirtland Safety Society. In 1838 the family left Ohio for Missouri, where Zina died on July 8, 1839. William lived for a time in Nauvoo, Illinois, before settling in Mt. Pisgah, Iowa, until his death on August 19, 1846. Zina and William had eight children, including Zina D.H. Jacobs Smith Young (who was married to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young), Chauncey Dyer Huntington, and Dimmock Baker Huntington\n\nChauncey Dyer Huntington letters copied from originals belonging to the LDS Church Historical Department, Salt Lake City\n\nFAC 1809-1847.
