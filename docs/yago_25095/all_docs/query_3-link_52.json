        "text": "Philip Anthony Spalding (1911-89) was at Balliol College, Oxford, 1930-3; lived in London, 1933-8, and moved to Churt (in Surrey) in 1938, the year of his marriage to Edna Brown, ne Young. Of independent means, Spalding devoted much of his life to reading and writing, and considered his diary to be his most important written work. His published work includes A Reader's Handbook to Proust (London, 1952), some volumes of verse and prose, and Self-Harvest, a study of diaries and the diarist (London, 1949).\n\nEmma Bigwood, later wife of A.H. Baynes, was Spalding's maternal grandmother and Norman Hepburn Baynes (1877-1961) was his uncle.\n\nThe Library also holds some photographs of Spalding, his house, relations, and some friends (MS. Photogr. c. 15, items 71-120).\n\nBoth sides of Spalding's life-long correspondence with Dr G.F. Nuttall are in Dr Williams's Library, London."
