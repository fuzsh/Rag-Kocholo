        "text": "Name: Rafael Rivera (a.k.a. Rafe)\n\nParents: Natalia Rivera, Gus Aitorro-Spaulding (a.k.a. Nicky, a.k.a. Nicholas Augustino)\n\nAge: Approximately 18\n\nRomantic liaisons: Daisy Cooper (a.k.a. Susan LeMay)\n\nOccupation: None, currently considering a career in law enforcement.\n\nOther romantic or familial connections: Rafe is currently uninvolved with anyone, romantically. Unfortunately, his extended family is currently uninvolved with him.\n\nThis kid is a SPAULDING. You’d never know it because none of the Spauldings bother to speak his name – he doesn’t get to help plan Lizzie’s wedding to Bill. None of his extended family visited him while he was incarcerated. There’s no evidence that anyone knows that he’s been released – Well, based on the eps I’ve been watching. GL IS putting me to sleep these days. There’s no evidence that anyone cares what’s happened to him, other than his mother, Olivia Spencer, and Frank Cooper.\n\nIn the time Rafe was incarcerated, Alan Spaulding has voiced his ‘concern’ for his granddaughter, Emma; has tried to control and manipulate his granddaughter, Lizzie, to stop her from becoming romantically involved with Bill Lewis; he’s appealed to his grandson, James, to be a ‘family first’ sort of man in order to win favor with him (Alan’s true objective is to butter James up in the hopes of getting closer to Beth – James’ mother).\n\nNot one word – that I’ve heard, has been uttered about Rafe’s care. He still has diabetes and has not received the best possible care given his financial situation. What sort of care is he getting now? Does anyone know because it was a plot point with Alan before. It seems to not matter at all now. Can’t we have a scene with Rafe running into ‘grandpa Alan’ at Cedar’s?\n\nGiven the fact that Alan has lost Beth for good, and was previously obsessed with Natalia,you would THINK that Alan might try to move in and muscle Olivia out of Natalia’s life – what a battle that could have been! Instead? Rafe may as well be dead to Alan. This glaring oversight is made WORSE by the fact that rather than incorporate the only diversity there has been in the Spaulding family lately, the writers have decided to rely on aimless plot devices that have Rafe deciding that he wants to be a police officer.\n\nWhen you shoot the town’s District Attorney and then flee the country, joining the Springfield PD’s finest is hardly a realistic occupational aspiration. Why isn’t Alan trying to woo Rafe over to the Spaulding side of the family? He likes to pit his children and grandchildren against one another. Rafe was falling under the evil spell Alan was casting before he was incarcerated. He was seduced by the fancy sports car, the big house, the pockets full of money… you name it! Wouldn’t he have an even greater appetite for success, now?\n\nWouldn’t Rafe be the perfect foil for James? I could even <gulp> try to tolerate Daisy if the dueling cousins ended up at odds in part because of her, and not just Alan’s manipulations. That Daisy has moved on to yet another person who was ‘out to get him’ might cause Rafe a bit of conflict in deciding what kind of response he’d want to make. He respects Frank and thinks of him as a father, of sorts, but may feel a loyalty to his own grandfather and want to make the lives of the Cooper family miserable.\n\nOnce Rafe tires of Alan’s manipulations, James could play ‘favored grandson’ and Rafe would end up on the receiving end of all of Alan’s material substitutions for love. It would have been the recasting of Phillip and Alan-Michael in a new generation. Rafe could pull off the Phillip role, James as Alan-Michael. I could see Rafe growing a conscience and eventually turning on Alan to protect Frank and the Coopers. That would be enough for Alan to switch his loyalties and support to James. Rafe would have to turn to someone else in the family for help. Phillip? Beth? Lizzie? Bill Lewis?\n\nI’m very disappointed that the writers continue to treat Rafe as the ‘disadvantaged youth’ from the wrong side of the tracks, unworthy of recognition by the Spauldings. What a missed opportunity, but then GL has been far too full of those, these past few years.\n\nI am in awe of fans who love daytime to the point of working to save it, despite what writers and EPs have done by way of making the genre unrecognizable. Fans are holding on to the hope that not only are daytime brass listening to their concerns, but that they’ll actually do something about them. It’s not just The Guiding Light. Daytime fans are in the same position no matter which show they watch. I’ve chosen to focus on The Guiding Light because of long swirling rumors that the show is on the verge of cancellation (rumors that have persistently dogged this show and its fans for a number of years, now).\n\nBelow are five things that I believe have been consistently wrong with the show – five things that are easily corrected.\n\n1. Get rid of the ‘live from Peapack’ shots. Daytime is about fantasy, escapism, and about the impossible becoming plausible. I have no doubt that Peapack has many homes with lush interiors filled with fine furniture, open floor plans, hardwoods, crown moulding, stainless steel appliances, and custom cabinetry. It makes sense that the show’s budget doesn’t allow for location shoots in those environments. Instead, the current interiors are shoddy, and frankly – they’re depressing. I’ve jokingly referred to Springfield as the land of cheap knotty wood paneling and faux stone. It’s no longer a joke to me. I’m distracted by the bad decor and dark interiors when trying to focus on the characters and dialogue.\n\nIt’s hard to see a man like Remy Boudreau living in a cheap apartment. His living conditions make sense for a couple like Daisy and Grady, who have a hard time maintaining steady employment. On any other show, willingly living in the conditions Remy lives in would be a sign of a character in emotional, psychological or financial distress. We would ask ourselves if Remy was punishing himself as part of a deep depression, or an unyielding sense of guilt for some perceived wrong. The type of decor that’s prevalent on GL usually comes with a liquor bottle and bad attitude on any other soap – and on the GL of the past.\n\nIf watching someone like Remy (solidly upper middle/upper class) live in such squalid conditions, think about what it means to see the fabulously wealthy Spauldings live in roughly two cramped rooms, or Olivia live in a tiny farmhouse, or the Lewises wandering from place to place because they have no where to live at all – that we’ve seen. The exception is Bill Lewis, who lives in a tiny hotel room. From Remy to the Spauldings to the Lewises – all are living in spaces that are the sizes of what should be their clothes closets.\n\nGuiding Light is the least aesthetically pleasing show in daytime. Beautiful people, ugly scenery. If it’s true that the network is saving money by purchasing/renting the current locations, great! But there’s a trade-off and given the ratings, I have a feeling that other (former) GL fans are having a hard time looking at the show in it’s current state.\n\n2. Make better use of the big moments and pay homage to your the show’s rich history. There aren’t a lot of ‘big moments’ left on any show, but GL had the perfect opportunity to grab back some of the show’s glory and to reunite it’s signature couple with this one scene:\n\nAs Reva lay dying, Josh confessed his heart and soul to her. They talked about how long and how deeply they’d loved each. Josh told her that he couldn’t conceive of a world that she wasn’t a part of (and we pretended not to remember that he’d already lived through a Reva “death” when she drove off a bridge during the course of her postpartum storyline. We realized that he meant that he’d already had to live in a Reva-less world once before and that he couldn’t stomach the thought of doing it again).\n\nWhat happened? Reva came back to him this time too, and Josh moved on without her. After all of his tears, his pain, and his comments about not wanting to live without her, not only did he move on but he moved on with her sister. Both Josh and Cassie treated Reva’s survival as an ‘annoyance’; Josh most especially when Reva let him know that she wanted to save their marriage. Every moment that took place after the ‘death’ scene made a mockery of Josh and Reva’s epic history. It just did not compute that when the writers could have cleared the coast for this legendary couple, they kept them apart. The writers were so determined to break them up that Reva defied the laws of nature. She became pregnant with another man’s baby after twice undergoing menopause. You figure that one out. I can’t and wouldn’t want to if I could.\n\n3. Allow characters to behave as if they live in the same town. Either that, or stop having them talk about how much they value family. Why, dear writers, has Beth put more effort into planning a romantic getaway with her boyfriend than into helping her daughter heal after her kidnapping ordeal?\n\nWe’ve seen many more scenes of Coop and Beth pawing each other than we have of Beth embracing Lizzie and trying to help her, most especially since Lizzie has become suspicious that her boyfriend, Bill Lewis, potentially played a role in her abduction. Is Beth aware of the fact that she’s still Lizzie’s mother? This is a mother and daughter living in the same house and yet they have very little contact.\n\nAlan is no angel, either. He was obsessed with Rafe’s medical care when Gus was alive. He arranged for Rafe to meet with the top physicians in the country and was willing to pay for advanced medical treatment to control his diabetes. Now? Natalia is killing herself to get the medicine Rafe needs by paying for it at her own pharmacy and having it sent to the prison (uh, yeah, that would happen in the real world!). Why haven’t the Spauldings mentioned Rafe and Natalia? How has Alan managed to avoid running into Natalia given how many of the same places they both visit?\n\nWhy hasn’t Alan already pulled enough strings to have Rafe sleeping in a single cell -with silk sheets covering his pillow top mattress? That’s only, of course, until Alan could have him sprung from prison. Alan has recently gone through a trial and faced prison time. No sympathy for Rafe? Is Alan only capable of being obsessed with one grandchild at a time? Is interfering with Lizzie’s love life REALLY more important than keeping Rafe out of prison, or at least safe while he’s behind bars? It’s hard to care about Alan’s obsession with Lizzie, given his lack of concern about Rafe.\n\n4. Recognize that imitation is not always the sincerest form of flattery. Guiding Light is working on solving one of it’s biggest problem – the shedding of old school characters and replacing them with newer characters who were meant to serve the same function, but somehow fall flat. In the mad dash to win over the 18 – 24s who were never planning a mass defection to daytime, great characters like Edmund were cut loose to make room for pale imitations like Kane Manera’s Grady Foley. Manera is a brilliant actor. His choices are instinctual and highly consistent. I like the actor, I just hate the writing for him. Between the writing and the direction, there was never any hope for Manera’s Grady to become a likable character. Where David Andrew McDonald’s Edmund was far more nuanced, and more choices about the character appeared to be placed in the actor’s hands, Manera’s Grady was more of a caricature of Edmund and every other GL bad boy.\n\nGrady was never allowed a moment to be ‘human’ (as Edmund was). Grady was never allowed to develop a backstory that would allow us to see him in a more vulnerable light, as Edmund was. While Edmund acted out as a way of dealing with the pain of being measured against the impossibly perfect Richard; Grady was just one more sociopath in a family of sociopaths. I’d like to say that I’ll miss Grady when he eventually goes, but I won’t. There’s nothing likable or root-worthy left when it comes to this character, through no fault of his portrayer.\n\n5. Don’t turn strong storylines and characters into ‘gimmicks’.\n\nWatching Olivia and Natalia this past week, I wondered if the writers have thought about where they’d take the two after their current friendship/relationship ends, and eventually it will. Will they go back to who they were before? Are they forever changed?\n\nIs this only a matter of living in the same home and raising Emma together? What makes their relationship romantic and not sisterly? Was Olivia’s lifetime of desperation in every relationship before this related to never feeling loved by any of the men she dated/married. Was she running from herself? Does Natalia love Olivia because of who she is? Does she love her because she finally has a feeling of family and she’s been so alone since Rafe was imprisoned and the Spauldings pretend she doesn’t exist?\n\nI like the slow development of their friendship/relationship, but if the writers simply throw them together after a kiss, won’t viewers perceive their relationship as a gimmick of some sort? It’s already feeling gimmicky with Natalia holding Liv’s hands through the ‘My Two Mommies’ presentation and not ‘getting it’ that the teacher and other parents thought they were lesbians. A ten year old would have picked that up!\n\nAll it took was a teacher making a suggestion and Olivia has developed new feelings for Natalia? It feels gimmicky that Olivia can’t use the word ‘lesbian’, but is able to plant a kiss on Natalia to illustrate her point – not long after Frank planted an unplanned kiss on her as well. It’s gimmicky – as Beth’s relationship with Alan was. It’s becoming as gimmicky as Beth’s relationship with Coop is, or Bill’s amnesia that shouldn’t affect what Lizzie remembers about the kidnapping, or Marina and Mallet and their babymania-out-of-nowhere storyline, or…. you get the point.\n\nIf this isn’t a show living on borrowed time, it needs to act like it. Slow down and take the time to work out the big and the small details. We’re not going anywhere.\n\nGross\n\nGoon\n\nGhastly\n\nThis message has been brought to you by… ‘Peapack Street’… like Sesame Street, only less entertaining. W-T-F! I’ve gotta say, I’ve held out hope for GL like so many other viewers. I’ve waited, and waited, and waited. ‘It HAS to get better’, I thought, ‘it can’t get any worse’. HA! You can never say those words out loud. You can’t even THINK them! The gods of daytime will hear your challenge and realize that you have no idea how capable they are of making things gut-wrenchingly worse (OH! Another ‘G’ word)!\n\nGrady’s attempt at seducing Vanessa made my skin crawl. The man has already escaped prosecution after killing Tammy. Now he’s kidnapped, bound and gagged Lizzie, and is off trying to seduce Vanessa. What is it with mature women and GL’s writers? They made fools of that pack of jackals following Alan the Prophet around Springfield – Alan’s true believers, who were funding his lifestyle and paying his attorney’s fees. Now Grady is making a practice of following women around town offering his services <GROAN! <- Yes, another ‘G’ word.\n\nThe one decent moment in the past two weeks, in my perspective, was the Cooper family coming together for the ‘last time’ in Harley’s house. The scene was touching, but also sad because Gus AND Harley are gone.\n\nI wish the writers would recast the character and bring her back. I loved BE in the role, but I’d accept a GOOD recast.Nothing feels the same about this show any more. There’s one one scene I look at and think, ‘AH! Classic GL’. Not one. It’s not just because of Gus and Harley (I liked, not loved, them as a couple).\n\nIt’s everything. The look, the scenes, the characters feel different. Something is missing with this show and I don’t know if the current PTB have the ability to help us get it back.\n\nLuckily, I still have Days of Our Lives. I will ignore the Sami-EJ situation, pretend they’re not even on the show, as I continue watching Days make it’s way back to the show it use to be.\n\nAbe Carver as Mayor? LOVE that. I hope it really does happen. This character has been an integral part of the show for years and the writers have had little for the man to do other than fend off Stefano Dimera in order to stop him from reclaiming a perennially psychologically frail and emotionally deceptive Lexie. I think DAYS is certainly on the right track by having Abe and Lexie work out their relationship. (View the YouTube clip below of Abe catching Lexie in the act with yet ANOTHER man – his adult son with another woman being the man she most recently cheated with, last.\n\nDaytime writers are so use to splitting couples up and having them move on to new relationships that it’s hardly worth becoming emotionally invested in any couple, as a viewer. With Abe working toward a position of power in Salem, how long will it be before the Dimeras find a way to draw Abe in? Lexie can only fight off her father for so long, and then Stefano is back to his old tricks, making her a pawn in yet another of his doomed-to-fail plans."
