        "text": "You may be right, Carl. Maybe Lujack was built up in case Judi Evans failed to have chemistry with actor succeeding Grant Aleksander. Also, Pam Long enjoyed writing opposite extremes, such as that and Vanessa and Billy (the lady and the cowboy).\n\nUnderstand that I have no criticism for Vincent Irizarry. Vince saved Lujack from being a total disaster in the hands of a lesser actor. I agree that his scenes with Bev McKinsey were wonderful. I simply could not get past the triteness of the gang thing and how quickly Lujack went from being a threat to the hero. Unlike others, I preferred Nick McHenry over Lujack. Vince and Bev still had the same wonderful adversarial scenes together, but without the Gallahad nonsense.\n\nAs for Beth, the point I attempted to make was that Phillip could not move on with Beth being alive in the story. If she were offscreen doing work for the foundation, it would not have made sense for Phillip to stay in Springfield. Beth had to be dead to free Phillip for other stories. Beth's presumed death also opened up story potential, though later on when Pam Long returned. There was an extended story in which Phillip basically stole Spaulding Enterprises from Alan. It had been motivated by years of anger and pent up grief for Beth. The story played very well and gave Chris Bernau an excellent swan song to GL.\n\nAlso, the audience knew that Beth probably wasn't really dead, which added a smidgen of suspense to the stories. I loved the way Pam Long set up Beth's return. Phillip was married to the viperous Blake, who plotted and schemed behind his back. There was an art dealer, Bruce something, who had paintings supposedly created by Beth. Phiilip began to receive mysterious phone calls that were apparently from Beth, while the audience saw the back of a woman painting in a studio with a tape of Still playing. Phillip discovered that Alan had paid off the coroner and became obsessed with the idea that Beth was still alive. For weeks and weeks, the audience was teased about whether or not Beth had actually returned.\n\nThe whole thing climaxed on a Friday with Phillip and Rick bursting into the studio of the artist. Phillip, stunned, gasped, \"Oh my God. It's you.\" Fadeout. The show was preempted on Monday, so we had to wait until Tuesday to discover that Bruce's girlfriend Dana had pretended to be Beth. Bruce had been paid by Alan to arrange it as revenge from having him sent to prison. Phillip was gutted, and so was the audience, until...the twist at the end of the same episode. In the final scene, Phillip held a photo of Beth (with actress Beth Chamberlin in the photo). A vicious Blake snatched it out of his hand. \"Don't you get it? There is no Beth!\" she exclaimed. She set the photo on fire. The camera zoomed into the flame, and when it pulled back out again, we saw the flames of a campfire with a girl sitting beside it. Off screen, a man said softly, \"Come to bed, Beth.\" He took her hand, and pulled her up toward the camera, which moved in for a close up of Beth Chamberlin's face.\n\nNo, I think Beth's death generated more story and drama than we would have gotten had she just been alive all that time. JMHO.\n\nJohn Bolger is fine as an actor, but horribly miscast as Phillip. Bolger is more of a romantic leading man. He plays light stories and characters well. He was hot back then. It was fun watching him dance on the tables of the Blue Orchid. But, he was not Phillip Spaulding. Grant played the complexities and inconsistencies of Phillip so very well that I could never see any other actor in that role. Maybe TPTB could have found someone else to play him effectively. We will never know. What I do know is that person was not Bolger.\n\nThey did flounder with Phillip upon GA's return. For one thing, Phillip changed so much under Bolger, that Phillip was not really the same character that GA abandoned. It took time for the writers to readjust the character back to Grant's interpretation. Also, Sheri Anderson had no idea how to write for GL. I ranted about this in another post. 1986-87 was almost impossible to watch, it was that bad. One of Grant's first stories back involved a hit man who was after Alan. I cannot even recall the reason. I seem to remember Alan being presumed shot and dumped into a shallow grave. The hit man went to Springfield. Phillip was restoring the lighthouse. The hit man poisoned a steak (I am not making this up). Phillip ate it, and then fell off a scaffolding while painting. It was an homage to D.O.A. I believe Rick raced against time to find an antidote to the slow-acting-but-fatal poison. Aye yi yi.\n\nPhillip did not really recover until Pam Long returned and wrote the aforementioned stories about the Spaulding takeover and his involvement with Blake.\n\nEdited September 5, 2010 by saynotoursoap\n\nIf I had my druthers, Judi Evans would have always played Beth, but I thought Beth Chamberlin did a good job as a replacement. The only time I really did not like Beth was during her return in the Rauch era. They dressed Beth in designer clothes. She always had a string of pearls around her neck. She had taken up with sleazeball Carl who abused her in front of her daughter Lizzie. All of that seemed so terribly horribly wrong for the character. I think that this was the Beth that viewers began to detest.\n\nTo me Beth Chamberlin played comedy well. I thought Lorelai was hilarious instead of bad. Even in Chamberlin's initial run, there were scenes of Beth making funny faces at Phillip inside the sanitarium. It is too bad the writers did not emphasize that more.\n\nI was also annoyed that when Chamberlin played the part, Beth's creative side was ignored. Beth was an artist and art was so important to her when Evans played the role. I think artistry was mentioned in passing later on, but it would have been nice if that aspect of the character was developed under Chamberlin. When Alan-Michael returned in 1987, he talked about Hope being an artists' rep in New York. Emphasizing Beth's artistry would have been a wonderful way to bring Hope Bauer back into the narrative."
