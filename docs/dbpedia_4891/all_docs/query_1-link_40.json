        "text": "US stock indexes soared on Thursday as new jobless claims data raised investors' confidence.\n\nThe Dow rallied 683 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 2.3% and 32.8%, respectively.\n\nThe S&P 500 enjoyed its best day since 2022, clawing back losses from Monday's big sell-off.\n\nUS stocks rallied on Thursday, clawing back losses from the rout earlier in the week as new jobs data boosted investors' confidence in the labor market and the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 2.3% for its best day since November 2022. The Nasdaq Composite spiked 2.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield ticked up two basis points to 3.98%, dipping slightly throughout the day after jumping above 4% earlier in the day.\n\nFueling Thursday's gain was a drop in weekly jobless claims that soothed fears of an imminent recession after last week's surprise jump in the unemployment rate.\n\nJobless claims last week dropped 17,000 to 233,00, marking the biggest fall in almost a year. The encouraging data comes after last week's disappointing nonfarm payroll report for July led to a historic selloff and sparked concerns of a recession.\n\nThe information technology sector led the S&P 500's rise, up 3.5%, while communication services also notched strong gains.\n\nPharmaceuticals giant Eli Lilly soared 14% after reporting strong earnings in its most recent quarter, helped by big demand for its GLP-1 weight loss drugs. The company's quarterly revenue of $11.30 billion beat analyst estimates of $9.98 billion, and the company raised its annual revenue outlook.\n\n\"We just see unbelievable demand, and we're not even trying that hard to promote this drug. We're not advertising, we told our sales reps to basically just service customers, don't promote,\" CEO David Ricks said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday.\n\nNext week, investors will be tuned into the latest inflation data, with July's consumer price index scheduled to be released on August 14. The data will be the next big input for bets on Fed policy for the rest of the year.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Thursday:\n\nS&P 500: 5,319.30, up 2.3%\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average: 39,446.82, up 1.76% (+683.30 points)\n\nNasdaq composite: 16,660.02, up 2.87%\n\nHere's what else is going on today:\n\nThere are two factors that will shape the stock market for the rest of the year.\n\nThe S&P 500 has an 83% accuracy rate in determining the outcome of presidential elections. Here's what to watch.\n\nPalantir soared after announcing a deal with Microsoft to sell AI tools to US defense and intelligence agencies.\n\nThe mortgage lock-in effect shaved $20 billion off the US economy last year.\n\nChina's imports last month surged 7.2% year-over-year as the country moves to stockpile tech ahead of trade restrictions, BofA said.\n\nIn commodities, bonds, and crypto:\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 1% to $76.04 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, ticked higher 0.9% to $79.02 a barrel.\n\nGold traded higher at $2,463.30\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose two basis points to 3.98%\n\nBitcoin rose 8% at $59,549."
