        "text": "MANILA: The Philippines and Germany committed on Sunday to finalizing a defense cooperation agreement this year, saying they strongly opposed expansive claims in the South China Sea amid continued tensions with Beijing in the disputed waters.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was in Manila to meet with his Philippine counterpart Gilberto Teodoro Jr. to enhance ties between their countries, which are celebrating 70 years of diplomatic relations.\n\nThey agreed to establish long-term relations between their armed forces to expand training and bilateral exchanges, explore opportunities to expand armaments partnerships and engage in joint projects.\n\nIn a joint statement, the ministers said they “strongly opposed any unilateral attempt to advance expansive claims, especially through force or coercion,” alluding to recent incidents in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Philippines and China have overlapping claims in the strategic waters along with a few other countries, but maritime confrontations between China Coast Guard ships and Philippine vessels have increased in recent months.\n\nIn June, Manila said the China Coast Guard rammed and boarded Philippine naval vessels during their resupply mission on the Second Thomas Shoal, part of the contested waters that has become a central flashpoint between the two countries.\n\n“There is only one cause of conflict in the South China Sea … It is China’s illegal and unilateral attempt to appropriate most, if not all, of the South China Sea as their internal waters,” Teodoro said during a press conference.\n\n“The Philippines is not provoking China. We do not seek war, yet we are mandated not only by our constitution but as an obligation to our countrymen to protect whatever areas, whether be jurisdiction or rights, that rightfully belong to the exclusive benefit of Filipinos.”\n\nManila and Berlin took measures to deepen their military ties just days after the US announced $500 million in military funding to modernize the Philippine army, an ongoing effort that will also see Manila “looking to engage Germany as a possible supplier,” Teodoro said.\n\n“These are in the command and control, anti-access aerial denial, maritime domain, aerial domain and in higher technologically capable equipment,” he added.\n\nPistorius, whose visit on Sunday was the first such trip by a German defense minister, underscored his country’s support for the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, which said that Beijing’s claims had no legal basis.\n\nThe decision, which was based on the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea, was rejected by China.\n\n“This ruling remains valid without any exceptions. It is our obligation to strengthen the maritime order, and we are living up to it,” Pistorius said, adding that countries must contribute to de-escalation efforts by keeping “all channels of communication open,” including with China.\n\n“It is important that we support and protect the rules-based international order in what we’re doing here. Our commitments and engagements here are not directed against anybody but instead, we’re focusing on maintaining the rules-based international order, securing freedom of navigation and protecting trade routes.”\n\nFor Manila, stronger defense ties with Germany are “important as a symbol of the Philippines’ growing security network” at the global level, said retired US Air Force Col. Raymond Powell, a director at Sealight, a project based in Stanford University that focuses on maritime transparency.\n\n“It carries fewer material benefits than its relationships with established Indo-Pacific powers like the US, Japan and France, but it is important (in) showing the Philippines as an integral member of a strong global community with significant economic resources and military capabilities,” Powell told Arab News.\n\nAaron Jed Rabena, a senior lecturer at the Asian Center of the University of the Philippines, said strengthening relations with Germany was a strategic move for Manila.\n\n“This is part of the Philippines’ strategy to broaden its web of security partners and get as much defense and political support from them as possible,” he told Arab News.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if Germany will soon take part in military exercises and even talk of a VFA (visiting forces agreement) with the Philippines.”\n\nDHAKA: The death toll from devastating floods caused by relentless monsoon rain and overflowing rivers in Bangladesh has risen to 23, with around 1.24 million families stranded across 11 districts, officials said on Monday.\n\nAs floodwaters recede slowly, many of the 5.7 million affected people remain isolated and in urgent need of food, clean water, medicine and dry clothes, above all in remote areas where blocked roads have hindered rescue and relief efforts.\n\nThe Bangladesh Meteorological Department said that flood conditions could persist if the monsoon rains continued, as water levels were receding very slowly.\n\nAround 470,000 people have taken refuge in 3,500 shelters in the flood-hit districts, where around 650 medical teams are on the ground to provide treatment, with the army, air force, navy, and the South Asian country’s border guard assisting in rescue and relief operations, authorities said.\n\nVast areas of land are submerged, posing a significant threat to crops if the floodwaters linger for an extended period, agriculture ministry officials said.\n\nAn analysis in 2015 by the World Bank Institute estimated that 3.5 million people in Bangladesh, one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries, were at risk of annual river flooding. Scientists attribute the exacerbation of such catastrophic events to climate change.\n\n“Countries like Bangladesh with negligible emissions and whose people have shown super resilience deserve immediate funds to address the impacts of climate change and frequent disasters,” said Farah Kabir, director of ActionAid Bangladesh.\n\n“We need to recover from the losses and damage we have faced, as well as build resilience to future impacts and take on green development pathways.”\n\nIn one of the worst-hit districts, Noakhali, 56-year-old Shukuri Begum lost her home as it was swept into a pond by the floodwaters, according to ActionAid. Terrified, she fled with her grandchildren to a neighbor’s house, but couldn’t stay there long as it was no longer safe.\n\n“I have a son with physical disabilities, and we couldn’t bring him with us. We had to stack beds and leave him on top, hoping he would be safe. I don’t know what’s waiting for us,” ActionAid quoted her as saying.\n\nThe campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are arguing in advance of their high-stakes Sept. 10 debate over whether microphones should be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.\n\nWhile it’s common for campaigns to quibble beforehand over debate mechanics, both Harris and Trump are under pressure to deliver a strong performance next month in Philadelphia. The first debate during this campaign led to President Joe Biden’s departure from the race.\n\nTrump on Sunday night raised the possibility that he might not show up on ABC, posting on his Truth Social network that he had watched the network’s Sunday show with a “so-called Panel of Trump Haters” and posited, “why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?” and urging followers to “Stay tuned!!”\n\nThe current dispute centers on the muting of microphones when a candidate isn’t speaking, a condition both Biden and Trump accepted for their June debate hosted by CNN. Both sides are accusing the other of gaming the system to protect their candidate.\n\nBiden’s campaign team made microphone muting a condition of its decision to accept any debates this year, and some aides now regret the decision, saying voters were shielded from hearing Trump’s outbursts during the debate. That move likely would not have helped the incumbent Democrat’s disastrous performance.\n\nThe Harris campaign now wants microphones to be live all the time, according to Harris spokesman Brian Fallon, who issued a statement needling Trump.\n\n“Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own,” Fallon said. Harris “is ready to deal with Trump’s constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button.”\n\nTrump spokesman Jason Miller retorted that the Republican nominee had “accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate.” He alleged Harris’ representatives sought “a seated debate, with notes, and opening statements.”\n\nMiller then took a shot at Harris not sitting for an interview or holding a news conference since Biden ended his reelection and endorsed her, arguing her campaign now wants “to give her a cheat sheet for the debate.”\n\nThe Harris campaign denied Miller’s claim that she wanted notes.\n\nDuring a stop Monday in the Washington area following a visit to Arlington National Cemetery, Trump said “we agreed to the same rules” in terms of the Sept. 10 debate, adding: “The truth is they’re trying to get out of it.”\n\nComplicating the negotiations this year is that debates are being orchestrated on an ad hoc basis by host networks, as opposed to the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, through which debate rules were negotiated privately.\n\nMicrophones have been unmuted for both candidates for most of televised presidential debate history. The debate commission announced that its October 2020 debate would have microphones muted when candidates were not recognized to speak after the first Biden-Trump contest descended into a shouting match. The second 2020 debate with the microphone muting rules was widely celebrated for being more substantive than the earlier matchup.\n\nKABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said Monday a recently ratified morality law would be enforced “gently,” after the international community and Afghans voiced concern over new restrictions.\n\nWomen must cover completely and not raise their voices in public, according to a 35-article law announced Wednesday by the justice ministry.\n\nIt imposes wide-ranging stipulations from behavior to dress and social interactions, including rules on men’s clothing and beard length as well as bans on homosexuality, animal fighting, playing music in public and non-Muslim holidays.\n\nThe United Nations, rights groups and Afghans have expressed concern that the law could lead to increased enforcement of rules on behavior and lifestyle, many already informally in place since the Taliban authorities took power in 2021 and implemented a strict interpretation of Islamic law — or sharia.\n\n“I must make it clear that force and oppression won’t be used while implementing these rules,” said deputy government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat in a voice message shared with AFP.\n\nThe rules “would be implemented very gently, informing people’s understanding, and guiding them,” he said.\n\nThe European Union added its voice to the chorus on Monday, saying it was “appalled” by a decree that “confirms and extends severe restrictions on the life of Afghans.”\n\n“This latest decision is another serious blow undermining the rights of Afghan women and girls, which we cannot tolerate,” said a statement from EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.\n\nBorrell urged the Taliban to put an end to such “systematic and systemic abuses against Afghan women and girls,” warning they may amount to gender persecution — a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe Taliban government has consistently dismissed international criticism of their policies, including condemnation of restrictions on women the UN has labelled “gender apartheid.”\n\nThe law sets out graduated punishments for non-compliance — from verbal warnings to threats, fines and detentions of varying lengths — enforced by the morality police under the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.\n\nRoza Otunbayeva, head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, has called the law a “distressing vision for Afghanistan’s future, where moral inspectors have discretionary powers to threaten and detain anyone based on broad and sometimes vague lists of infractions.”\n\nSOLINGEN, Germany: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Monday the government would tighten weapons controls and speed up deportations after a suspected Islamist knife attack in the western city of Solingen.\n\nFriday night’s deadly stabbing at a street festival has reignited a debate over immigration in the country and put extra pressure on Scholz ahead of key regional elections set for Sunday.\n\n“This was terrorism, terrorism against us all,” Scholz said on a visit to Solingen, where he laid flowers at a memorial to the victims.\n\nA 26-year-old Syrian with suspected links to the Daesh group is alleged to have carried out the attack, which left three people dead and eight more wounded.\n\nScholz said he was “angry... at the Islamists who threaten our peaceful coexistence.”\n\n“We will now have to tighten up the weapons regulations... in particular with regard to the use of knives,” Scholz said.\n\nStronger weapons controls would come “very quickly,” Scholz said.\n\nGermany would also have to “do everything we can to ensure that those who cannot and must not stay here in Germany are repatriated and deported,” Scholz said.\n\nThe suspect, named as Issa Al H., was able to evade the police after the attack before reportedly handing himself in to law enforcement on Saturday evening.\n\nThe Syrian was detained on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and belonging to a “terrorist group.”\n\nThe Daesh group on Saturday said one of its members had carried out the attack in an act of “revenge.”\n\nThe group subsequently published a video via the jihadists’ Amaq news agency purporting to show the Solingen attack, in which the veiled man said he intended to carry out reprisals for “massacres” in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nThe claim could not be immediately verified.\n\nThe suspected attacker has raised concerns in Germany for the seeming ease with which he avoided authorities attempts to remove him.\n\nAccording to the Bild and Spiegel news outlets, the suspect arrived in Germany in December 2022 and had a protected immigration status often given to those fleeing war-torn Syria.\n\nHe was meant to have been deported to Bulgaria, where he had first arrived in the European Union, but he went missing.\n\nThe suspect was not known to German security services as a dangerous extremist, according to officials.\n\nAccording to federal police figures, almost 52,976 people were supposed to be deported or expelled from Germany last year.\n\nSuccessful deportations however only took place in 21,206 instances — less than half of the total planned — often because the individuals concerned were “not handed over” to police.\n\nThe attack spurred a new debate around immigration in the EU’s most populous country ahead of regional elections next weekend in Saxony and Thuringia, where the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is set to make gains.\n\nThe attack would strengthen the perception that the government was “overwhelmed,” Ursula Muench, the director of the Academy for Political Education, told AFP.\n\nThe AfD has accused successive governments of contributing to “chaos” by allowing in too many immigrants, and called for a stop to new entries.\n\nFriedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU, Germany’s main opposition party, meanwhile urged the government to stop taking in refugees from Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nThe government — a fraught coalition between Scholz’s Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business FDP — had already announced moves to toughen immigration rules.\n\nFollowing an attack by a 25-year-old Afghan at an anti-Islam rally in Mannheim in May, the government said it would look to restart deportations directly to Afghanistan and Syria after years in which they were halted.\n\nGerman security services have been on high alert for Islamist attacks since the Gaza war erupted on October 7 with the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nGermany has been hit by several such attacks in recent years, with the most deadly being a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12 people.\n\nLONDON: Thirteen asylum-seekers have committed suicide in the UK in the past two-and-a-half years, with another 24 attempting to take their own lives in that period.\n\nA report by The Times found these included children, such as a 14-year-old Iraqi girl who threw herself from a building and sustained severe head injuries.\n\nOf the 13 to die, all bar one were awaiting decisions on asylum applications, with the other having been denied. They ranged in age from 19 to 45 years old and included a 21-year-old Russian woman who took her own life beside a London canal.\n\nAn additional 32 cases of serious self-harm by asylum-seekers were also recorded by the Home Office during the period in question, with the youngest aged 17 and the oldest aged 48. Among the nationalities represented in the self-harm data were people from Iran, Syria, Libya, South Africa and Turkiye.\n\nA Yemeni doctor, who claimed asylum in the UK in 2023, told The Times that conditions for asylum-seekers in the UK were unsuitable, blaming them for the number of people self-harming or attempting suicide.\n\n“The staff members treat you like you’re some kind of criminal — it feels like a prison. You don’t get visitors except (during) certain hours (and) it’s not easy to go out”, she said.\n\n“A lot of asylum-seekers keep saying that we’re treated like beggars, when a lot of asylum-seekers come from overly achieving professions. Overnight you’re treated like that — and this is how your life is, for you don’t know how long. I never thought that I would have to fight on a daily basis for basic human needs or basic rights.”\n\nThe length of time and uncertainty surrounding asylum applications in the UK is thought to play a large role in the mental health conditions of asylum-seekers in the UK, with over two-thirds of the 161,000 asylum-seekers awaiting initial decisions on their status in spring 2023 waiting over six months for an outcome.\n\nA Namibian nurse and former UN employee told The Times she had applied for asylum in the UK in February 2020 but did not receive her rejection until August 2023.\n\nDuring that time, she said, she was “taken out of a safe environment” and moved to a hotel in Glasgow, where six people were stabbed by a Sudanese asylum-seeker in June 2022 while she was a resident there.\n\nShe said she and others were not offered mental health support in the aftermath of the attack.\n\n“Everything feels like we cannot ask questions,” she told The Times. “It is something that I never expected in the UK. Never in my life did I expect that I would be afraid in the UK.”\n\nProf. Cornelius Katona, asylum-seeker and refugee mental health lead at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, told The Times: “People who have been displaced and are seeking refuge and protection may have faced violence, danger or exploitation and lost loved ones. These can be deeply traumatic experiences and increase the risk that someone might develop a mental illness such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n“Asylum-seekers must also contend with significant housing, employment and financial uncertainty when they arrive in the UK, while also experiencing difficulty in accessing healthcare. All these factors can exacerbate an existing mental illness and potentially lead to increased suicidality or self-harm.”\n\nDespite the Home Office providing training to staff to deal with issues including PTSD and suicidal tendencies, questions have also been raised about the suitability of dedicated holding centers, including a former Royal Air Force base at Wethersfield in Essex, where emergency services were summoned on 38 separate occasions in the first five months of 2024.\n\nMedecins Sans Frontieres claimed 41 percent of people at the site had made use of its medical services citing suicidal thoughts or behavior.\n\nThe charity told The Times: “Although there are clear differences between hotels and containment sites, the often poor living conditions, safeguarding failures and extended delays people experience lead to various levels of anguish and mental health issues.”\n\nA case brought by four former residents about the site is currently being heard by the High Court in London. There have also been allegations that the Bibby Stockholm barge, a vessel due to be decommissioned in January 2025, was unfit for housing asylum-seekers after an Albanian man died of suspected suicide in December 2023.\n\nA Home Office spokesman told The Times: “We take the health and well-being of asylum-seekers seriously and at every stage in the process will seek to ensure that all needs and vulnerabilities are identified and considered, including those related to mental health and trauma. We ensure that where a serious incident is reported, we take the necessary action so our safeguarding standards remain at the highest level.”"
