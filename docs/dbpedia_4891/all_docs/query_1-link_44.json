        "text": "Manchester United chiefs remain frantically scouring the market for a suitable midfield addition to bolster Erik ten Hag’s options next season.\n\nDespite agreeing personal terms with Manuel Ugarte last month, the Uruguayan is no longer a viable option due to Paris Saint-Germain’s transfer demands of £51 million. They want to recuperate the same fee they paid for him a year ago, even after using him sporadically over the course of the 2023/2024 term.\n\nAlas, alternative options are being considered. United have found themselves linked with a host of names, with more concrete candidates believed to be Youssouf Fofana, Ederson and Sander Berge, the latter of which they’ve held ‘initial talks’ over with Burnley.\n\nRead more: Premier League club have just met the asking price of ‘complete midfielder’ United are in talks for\n\nUnited could resort to signing an old flame\n\nShould the club fail to sanction a new arrival in the coming days, they could turn to a familiar face in the form of Sofyan Amrabat, who has returned to Fiorentina following his season-long loan spell at Old Trafford.\n\nUnited opted against activating his £21.4m buy clause, but remain interested in bringing the Moroccan back on a cut-price, permanent transfer.\n\nJournalist Jacque Talbot believes this may be the outcome of United’s midfield hunt, too, as he took to X (Twitter) today to share his opinion, writing: “My personal feeling is that it will be Amrabat again.\n\n“Casemiro is on wages that no right-thinking club would go near (£350k). He has two years left + option. Even if a club offers £200k, why would he push leave? He’s won everything there is to win & nearing the end of his career.”\n\nAmrabat, 27, featured 30 times under Ten Hag last term, with 17 appearances coming from the offset. He started and played the full 90 minutes of the Reds’ FA Cup triumph in May, and it was arguably his best performance of his temporary spell.\n\nMore Stories / Latest News\n\n‘My personal feeling’: Trusted journo tells United fans who he thinks club will sign, they might be disappointed\n\nAug 8 2024, 12:43\n\n‘Fire burning’ – Ten Hag pleased with how new signing is recovering from injury\n\nAug 8 2024, 12:39\n\nJourno reveals what he’s just been ‘told’ by PSG regarding potential deal with Manchester United"
