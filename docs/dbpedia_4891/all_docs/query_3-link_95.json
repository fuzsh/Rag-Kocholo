        "text": "US and Philippine forces, backed by an Australian air force surveillance aircraft, have unleashed a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes and sank a mock enemy ship as part of largescale war drills in and near the disputed South China Sea that have antagonised Beijing.\n\nMilitary officials and diplomats from several countries watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's northern home province.\n\nMore than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines, along with a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries, were participating in annual combat-readiness drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nThe drills, which started on April 22 and end on Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defence treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defence from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern.\n\nThat strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of US President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals.\n\nThey have led to minor collisions that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez said.\n\n\"We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the US is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map.\n\nIt says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel the Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas.\n\nThe Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by US and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern.\n\nThe target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country.\n\nChina has opposed military drills involving US forces as well as increasing US military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.\n\nFor the first time in years, the combat exercises were staged in and near the fiercely contested Spratly Islands area, which China has closely guarded with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia flotillas.\n\nOn Monday, US and Filipino marines transported by Black Hawk helicopters practiced securing an airfield in the country's northernmost town of Itbayat along the Bashi Channel near southern Taiwan.\n\nBitter dispute turns to skies over military island base\n\nA small group of journalists, including from the AP, was invited to witness the air and ground combat maneuvers.\n\n\"They're not operating in safe areas. They're operating slightly further to the western bounds and they're doing that in order to practice in ways that they might have to work for real,\" said British Defence Attach√© to Manila Bea Walcot, who watched the ship-sinking drill.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider US military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps.\n\nThat was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint would antagonise Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which allowed US forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the channel from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that the deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes.\n\nThe Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said."
