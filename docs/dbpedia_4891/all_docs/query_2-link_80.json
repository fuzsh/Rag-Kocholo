Our four nations reaffirm the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal Award as a final and legally binding decision on the parties to the dispute,\" it added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese military's Southern Theater Command held joint naval and air combat patrols near Huangyan Island, also known as Bajo de Masinloc, or Scarborough Shoal.\n\nThe drills involve reconnaissance, early-warning, fast maneuvering and joint strike capabilities tests, according to local state-run daily Global Times.\n\nLast week, the Philippines and Japan conducted their first joint maritime drill in the South China Sea."
