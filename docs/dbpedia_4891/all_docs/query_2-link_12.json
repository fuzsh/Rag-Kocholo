        "text": "Instead of aligning with one superpower against another, the Philippines is bent on enhancing its own strategic agency in world affairs.\n\nRelease of Taiwanese and Indonesian fishermen the latest development in series of combative fishing-related incidents between Beijing and Taipei.\n\nManila also said a provisional agreement with China on resupply missions for troops at the Second Thomas Shoal would be reviewed.\n\nPredicting typhoons is a matter of life or mass death yet it is backed by imperfect science. So, how have the boffins at the Hong Kong Observatory been rising to the challenge?\n\nThe vessel was one of the attractions in a show of freshly acquired tech that also included underwater drones.\n\nManila’s assertive approach contrasts with Hanoi’s “low profile” way of dealing with their respective South China Sea rows, analysts say.\n\nTokyo’s military drills with Manila and defence equipment agreement with Vietnam will have China taking notice, observers say.\n\nPLA says it ‘dispelled’ a transport plane while Manila says Chinese jets endangered its pilots.\n\nFollowing the drills off Manila, the Philippines says it will send a ship to Vietnam later this year to boost maritime cooperation.\n\nUS-made King Air 350ER expands search and rescue radius from 200 to 1,000 nautical miles as China pushes to develop maritime industries.\n\nThe drill involving the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System was partly based on a potential South China Sea conflict, analysts say.\n\nCanadian Defence Minister Bill Blair says the two nations needed to work more closely together to maintain order in the Indo-Pacific."
