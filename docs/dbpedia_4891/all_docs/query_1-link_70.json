        "text": "NBC unveils AI chatbot for Olympics coverage...Details revealed on LPGA's 2025 schedule...Bidders for 2030, '34 World Cups submit plans to FIFA\n\nNBC unveils AI chatbot for Olympics coverage\n\nBy Rob Schaefer\n\nThe challenge of helping sports fans parse 7,000 hours of Paris Olympics coverage this summer led NBCUniversal CMO/Entertainment & Sports Jenny Storms to ponder the possibility of creating a “Clippy,” Microsoft’s paperclip-shaped virtual assistant, for the 2024 Games.\n\nNearly a year later, enter OLI, a generative AI-powered chatbot NBCU developed in partnership with design technology agency Huge and using Google’s Gemini Flash model. The “viewing guide,” as Storms calls OLI, appears to U.S.-based users as a chat bar in the corner of NBCU-owned web channels and is designed to combine comprehensive program recommendations with a friendly tone.\n\n“We know from research and insights from past [Olympic] Games that people always struggle with, ‘How do I find what I want to watch?’” Storms told SBJ. “Our goal is to get people what they’re looking for and what they want to consume as fast and frictionless as possible.”\n\nOLI went live across NBCOlympics.com, NBCSports.com, NBC.com, usanetwork.com and today.com ahead of the opening ceremony last week and has already logged hundreds of thousands of users, Storms said. It was trained upon NBC programming information and, via technical assistance from Huge, equipped with a sense of logic of how to answer programming-related questions.\n\nRead More\n\nAs one example, the query ‘When does the U.S. basketball team play’ submitted Monday morning returned several responses within seconds – the date, time, opponent and broadcast information for the U.S. women’s national team’s next game, as well as a re-airtime and the same information for the men’s team’s next contest. It does the same for questions about specific athletes, even with slight misspellings (e.g., a question that referenced “Lebrun James” returned the same responses as “LeBron.”)\n\n“Where the secret sauce is in this is [OLI] leveraging NBCUniversal’s programming information that actually is not public,” Storms said.\n\n“When you think about our television formats -- we know exactly when, in daytime coverage today, women’s basketball will be on NBC, along with other sports coverage. But then we also know exactly when the full event is on and on what network. That information is actually not searchable in general without our programming format data.”\n\nThroughout the Games, NBCU will evaluate metrics including unique users and number of questions asked, as well as anecdotal feedback collected through a prompt that asks for a thumb up or down impression and a multiple-choice inquiry for reasoning, to gauge OLI’s performance.\n\n“We have spent the last ten months working very hard with the Google Cloud and Gemini team, along with our partner agency Huge, in really training the [large language model] and helping understand and bring in the type of logic and queries we’re typically going to get in an Olympics,” Storms said. “In any new endeavor and any innovation, we have incredible progress. We’re not to perfection. But that’s something to aspire to in future opportunities around this type of idea.”\n\nDetails revealed on LPGA's 2025 schedule\n\nBy Josh Carpenter\n\nThe LPGA held its mid-year meeting with tournament partners today, and several notable items came out of the meeting, including details on next year’s schedule, according to one person on the call. The 2025 season will begin two weeks later with the Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions in Orlando. That event was held Jan. 18-21 this year.\n\nThe LPGA said it was still working to finalize a 34-35 event schedule, though that’s not expected until November, the person said. The tour also said it would return to just one European summer swing in 2025 after going there twice this year because of the Olympics.\n\nAlso, the tour is dipping into its reserves as it continues to invest in future growth. The tour has made significant investments in digital and technology in recent years to improve its website, mobile performance and scoring, among other areas.\n\nOther notable items from the meeting include:\n\nThe tour is in the process of hiring a chief people officer to fill the role vacated by Wendy Caves, who recently left to join TMRW Sports.\n\nThe tour is continuing its search for a health insurance sponsor that will give players full coverage.\n\nBidders for '30, '34 World Cups submit plans to FIFA\n\nFIFA said today it has \"received in Paris the formal bid books\" from leaders of the seven member federations which are the exclusive bidders for the World Cups of 2030 and 2034. The 2030 World Cup is being co-hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco plus three South American neighbors -- Argentina, Paraguay and inaugural 1930 host Uruguay -- who will \"each stage one of the tournament’s 104 games.\" Saudi Arabia is the only candidate for the 2034 World Cup, which was \"fast-tracked\" by FIFA last year. The two bids are \"set to be confirmed\" at a Dec. 11 online meeting of FIFA’s 211 member federations (AP, 7/29).\n\nLVCVA signs sponsorship deal with F1\n\nThe Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has \"furthered its ties\" to F1 with a sponsorship deal, becoming an official partner of the series beginning with yesterday's Belgium Grand Prix. The deal is \"good through 2025\" and comes a few months before the second Las Vegas Grand Prix in November. The financial details of the new F1 deal were not immediately available. The deal includes the LVCVA \"hosting events at select races worldwide and trackside branding at various F1 races this season.\" The deal with F1 is on top of the authority's $19.5M, three-year deal to sponsor the Las Vegas GP (LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL, 7/29).\n\nQuakes-Chivas sets Leagues Cup attendance high\n\nBy Alex Silverman\n\nThe Earthquakes’ opening Leagues Cup match against Mexican juggernaut Chivas de Guadalajara drew a crowd of 50,765 to Levi’s Stadium on Saturday, a new attendance record for the second-year tournament featuring all 47 clubs from MLS and Liga MX. The crowd in Santa Clara propelled Leagues Cup to an opening-weekend average attendance of 21,415, up 24% from the start of last year’s inaugural edition.\n\nThe 2024 tournament is supported by 15 corporate sponsors, up from nine in 2023. New additions include Beats, Carnival, Frito Lay, Lowe’s, Sherwin-Williams and Strauss workwear.\n\nFC Cincinnati nearing bid to host MLS ASG\n\nFC Cincinnati could reportedly \"bid on hosting the Major League Soccer All-Star Game as soon as the 2027 contest,\" team co-CEO Jeff Berding said today. Berding said that the team is \"considering bidding for that game but has not yet made a final decision.\" The club hopes the \"overhauled Duke Energy Convention Center\" and a \"new headquarters hotel\" south of the convention center will be complete \"by 2027,\" which \"should bolster any bid by the team and the city.\" Berding expects to \"start making progress by the end of 2024 on a mixed-used development on FC Cincinnati's land.\" Berding had previously stated in 2023 that MLS likes to showcase new markets. The club has reportedly expected to host in the next five years (CINCINNATI BUSINESS COURIER, 7/29).\n\nNFL investigating Texans minority owner's conduct\n\nThe NFL is investigating whether Texans minority owner Javier Loya \"violated the league’s personal-conduct policy.\" NFL investigators have initiated inquiries into allegations of \"inappropriate behavior\" by Loya \"during poker parties he hosted\" at his Louisville mansion in May 2022. Loya, co-CEO of energy brokerage OTC Global Holdings LP, was \"charged with first-degree rape and sexual abuse stemming from his alleged behavior at the poker parties.\" He \"denied the allegations at the time.\" In April, a Kentucky judge \"dismissed the felony charges,\" and Loya \"pled guilty to a misdemeanor count of physical harassment.\" He paid a $100 fine (BLOOMBERG NEWS, 7/29).\n\nThis Week in History: Olympics return after WWII\n\nJuly 29, 1948 -- King George VI opens the XIV Summer Olympic Games at Wembley Stadium in London, the first Olympic games following a hiatus caused by World War II. The last Summer Olympics held before the 1948 Games were the 1936 Berlin Games.
