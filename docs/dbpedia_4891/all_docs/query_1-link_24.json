        "text": "“Tekkerz was more than a football experience to my kids and family. It was a mix of respect, discipline, top skills, hard training, teamwork and fun! The individual approach and recognition of each player’s skills and weaknesses made them help each other and grow together as a group. The sportsmanship my sons acquired at Tekkerz will be carried throughout their lives. Thanks to coach Baz and team!.”\n\nDaniel M, parent of 2 boys, U10 & U12\n\n“Tekkerz was not my daughter’s first taste of team football – she had previously taken part in some holiday camps. But she didn’t really enjoy these, so we tried Tekkerz because she liked the idea of a girls-only team. The Tekkerz coaches were fantastic, covering techniques, positioning, reading the game … and my daughter really enjoyed the social side, seeing her friends every week. So, a great balance, and we could see the progress she made in matches that were organised.”\n\nChris, U11 Girl parent\n\n“It has been great to see our son take to football and Tekkerz as a part of his identity – and we’ve been able to build so much personal independence and decision-making for him around it as well.”\n\nThank you to all the coaches.”\n\nRG, parent of U11 boy\n\n“PSA and the Tekkerz program have given all three of my sons an outstanding football coaching experience. The program itself has allowed them to develop skills, ball control and an ability to play the game in a really fun and engaging environment. Coach Baz in particular not only has the football skills and coaching ability to get the best of the players, but he also has a calm and nurturing disposition that children of all ages really enjoy.”\n\nBen L, U6, U9 & U11 parent\n\n“My son joined Tekkerz right when they had only just started out. It's only after our recent move back to Europe that I've truly come to appreciate the exceptional quality of Tekkerz. Their coaches, particularly Baz, are brilliant, consistently ensuring that every child is engaged and enjoying themselves, regardless of their skill level. While the focus on fun and enjoyment is evident, the club also excels in advancing the children's technical football abilities\n\nWhat sets Tekkerz apart is its genuine inclusive atmosphere, which fosters a sense of belonging and community among the young players. The professionalism in organising tournaments, managing training schedules, and facilitating kit orders is second to none. As a parent, I always felt well-informed and confident in the club's operations and intentions. For parents considering a supportive, inclusive, and professionally run football club for their children, Tekkerz stands out as a brilliant choice.”\n\nKH, parent of U9 boy\n\n“Tekkerz has been everything we’ve wished from a football club since we moved to HK. The children swiftly develop skills from high intensity training sessions, games and tournaments that are geared to children of all ages and abilities. The coaches are superb at stimulating a love of football in the youngest ones, building their skills and ability up through the years, and producing talented football players in the Tekkerz philosophy. The Tekkerz community is more than a football club, it’s an extended family, and I couldn’t imagine DB without it.”\n\nBarry R, U11 parent"
