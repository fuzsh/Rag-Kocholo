It came after the sides signed Philippines-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement last month which allows soldiers from the two nations to train and operate in each other's territories under Visiting Force status. According to a statement by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippines Navy and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces conducted the first bilateral maritime cooperative activity in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). Manila identifies parts of the vast disputed South China Sea as WPS. “This activity was part of the ongoing efforts to strengthen regional and international cooperation towards realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific,” it said. It included a communications exercise, tactical maneuvering, and a photographic exercise. “This collaborative exercise enhanced the tactical capabilities” of the two sides, and “reinforced the strong ties and mutual commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the region,” the statement added.
