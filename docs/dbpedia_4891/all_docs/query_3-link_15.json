        "text": "This was supposed to be the year that Vietnam reaped the benefits from one of its largest natural gas discoveries.\n\nAn estimated 150 billion cubic meters of the fuel, enough to power a city the size of Hanoi for decades, was discovered 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Vietnam’s central coast in 2011. If all had gone to plan, the “Blue Whale” project led by Exxon Mobil Corp. would have gone online late last year."
