        "text": "New coach Roberto Mario Carlos Gomez with Wallace Cheung (right)\n\nSouth China Morning Post\n\nArgentine Mario Gomez replaces Yeung Ching-kwong as coach of South China\n\nManagement unhappy with results and brings in the former Valencia and Inter assistant\n\nChan Kin-wa\n\nYeung Ching-kwong became the first BOCG Life Premier League coaching casualty after the former Hong Kong soccer player was suddenly sacked and replaced at South China on Monday.\n\nMario Gomez, who was Hector Cuper's assistant at Valencia and then Inter Milan in the late 1990s and the coach of Ecuadorian club Deportivo Cuenca last season, took over the hot seat.\n\n\"I understand South China has a long tradition in Hong Kong soccer, but I still need more time to study the team as this is a new challenge for me,\" said the Argentine, who arrived in Hong Kong over the weekend.\n\nCuenca finished bottom in the Ecuador Premier League this season and Gomez was released by the club.\n\nSouth China convenor Wallace Cheung Kwong-yung said Yeung was replaced because the team's results failed to live up to expectations.\n\n\"We only have a 10 per cent chance to win the league title, the least of the so-called big four clubs, but I don't want to give up,\" said Cheung. \"This is a hard decision, but has to be made. The earlier the better.\n\n\"I hope the change will bring in new ideas to keep the club competitive in the Premier League.\"\n\nSouth China are third in the table with 15 points, one behind joint leaders Eastern and Sun Pegasus, but have played one more game than Eastern.\n\nDefending champions Kitchee, who are two points behind, have three games in hand over South China.\n\nYeung said on Monday night that he was caught by surprise and he was only informed of the decision on Sunday.\n\n\"They only contacted me by phone that I am not the coach anymore,\" said Yeung. \"It is unfair to use results as an excuse because we have been doing quite well recently.\"\n\nYeung said his contract with the club was due to expire at the end of the season, but the management had yet to indicate how they would bring closure.\n\nSouth China, who thrashed I-Sky Yuen Long 5-2 in their Premier League match on Saturday, will represent Hong Kong in the AFC Cup, which starts in February. The Caroliners' next game will be against Yuen Long again on Friday in the League Cup group stage.\n\nAssistant coach Ku Kam-fai is likely to take temporary charge because Gomez said he needed time before taking over the reins.\n\nSouth China Morning Post\n\nDismal start for South China coach Mario Gomez as Caroliners trounced\n\nNew Argentine coach has a torrid time as his team concede three first-half goals against Eastern in semi-final clash\n\nMario Gomez got off to the worst possible start as South China’s new coach as his team conceded two goals in the first 10 minutes against rivals Eastern in the Canbo Senior Shield on Sunday.\n\nThe Caroliners lost 3-1 to the team they beat 2-1 in the league at the same venue a month ago under former coach Yeung Ching-kwong – who was among the 3,400-strong crowd at Mong Kok Stadium.\n\nThe semi-final result left question marks over the local giants’ ability at the moment to front up to the big teams.\n\nEastern will now meet Kitchee for the title in three weeks’ time.\n\nCentre half Jean Kilama opened the scoring for Eastern following a corner kick on eight minutes, before Dylan Macallister added to the tally two minutes later. Veteran Lo Chi-kwan extended their lead to 3-0 before the half-hour. Yuto Nakamura pulled one back for South China just before half-time.\n\nSecond-half substitute Manoel Santos could have set up an interesting climax, but his free kick hit the crossbar.\n\nArgentine Gomez, a former assistant of Hector Cuper at leading European clubs Valencia and Inter Milan, left the pitch immediately after the final whistle 8before returning to hold his hands up for the dire start.\n\n“Giving away three goals in such a short space of time] was very disappointing and I have to take the responsibility,” said the coach. “The first goal was a mistake and we now have to work hard to consolidate our defence.\n\n“We did create some scoring chances but were unable to take them. We need to improve as we still have a long way to go.”\n\nSouth China face a hectic schedule in the second half of the season, with their AFC Cup campaign kicking off.\n\nGomez said on his arrival that the regional cup competition would be his target after moving here for a new challenge.\n\nEastern right back Lo, who scored against South China in their 2-1 defeat in the league, was delighted to pick up another goal.\n\n“It was a bit of a surprise scoring two early goals against a top team like South China, which made life difficult for them,” said the 33-year-old veteran.\n\n“I know they are undergoing some internal instability because of the change of personnel but their players did work very hard trying to come from behind.”\n\nEx-Kitchee player Lo is looking forward to the final against his former club. “Our spirit is high and the morale is fantastic after beating South China. We want to keep the momentum going and win the Shield,” he said.\n\nSouth China Morning Post\n\nHong Kong punished for poor finishing against Guangdong in Interport Cup\n\nChan Kin-wa in Huizhou\n\nGuangdong punished Hong Kong's poor finishing, winning the first leg of the Interport Cup 1-0 against the run of play in Huizhou yesterday.\n\nHong Kong had three clear-cut chances to break the deadlock with Lo Kong-wai, a second-half substitute, missing a series of golden opportunities in front of a 10,000-strong crowd at the Huizhou Olympic stadium.\n\nIn the end, Hong Kong were sucker punched when Lu Lin, a striker for China Super League side Guangzhou R&amp;F, scored the only goal midway through the second half.\n\n\"I don't think we would have lost the match if I had scored from one of those [chances]\" lamented South China midfielder Lo. \"I'm not even sure how I missed them. Maybe I lacked the confidence in the crucial moment.\"\n\nOne of the young guns deployed by coach Kim Pan-gon following an impressive Asian Games campaign in September, Lo had only the Guangdong goalkeeper to beat after coming on for forward Lam Hok-hei.\n\nBut he shot wide first time from eight yards out before another close range attempt was saved by the goalkeeper. The third chance went begging as his weak shot went straight into the arms of the goalkeeper.\n\nCoach Kim said he felt Hong Kong had an improved second half and should have scored against the home side as the Guangdong players, who are still in the off-season, lacked stamina.\n\nEven after Lu's goal, full back Jack Sealy had a shot cleared in front of the goal by a Guangdong defender while forward Xu Deshuai was apparently pulled down by a defender inside the Guangdong penalty area but the referee waved play on.\n\n\"We were struggling to find that little edge to win the match,\" said coach Kim.\n\n\"Other than that, I am quite happy with the performance, especially from some of the young players who have proved themselves against Guangdong. Kong-wai missed a couple of chances because he was not tough enough mentally. He has to improve.\n\n\"We will spend the next few days trying to sharpen our finishing and I am confident we can come back and win the second leg and the tournament on our home turf on Sunday.\"\n\nSouth China Morning Post\n\nHong Kong coach Kim Pan-gon looks at positives despite defeat in Interport Cup\n\nGuangdong win Interport but HK coach keeps the faith with younger players\n\nChan Kin-wa\n\nHong Kong's experimental squad were beaten in the annual Interport Cup by Guangdong yesterday, but coach Kim Pan-gon vowed to continue giving his young charges playing chances.\n\nFollowing a 1-0 defeat in the away leg on Wednesday, Hong Kong could only manage a goalless draw in front of the biggest crowd so far this season - 3,700 - at Mong Kok Stadium, as Guangdong lifted the trophy for the 22nd time out of a total of 37.\n\nThe hosts also saw forward Wong Wei taken to hospital after a bad tackle by Guangdong captain Lu Lin in the first half. The 22-year-old YFCMD player broke his right leg and the ugly scene that ensued created uproar among the fans, who subsequently booed the Guangdong captain whenever he touched the ball.\n\n\"It was a disappointing result as we failed to create many real chances to score,\" said coach Kim. \"We had so many fans come to support us, but we could not deliver.\n\n\"The early injuries of Jack Sealy and Wong disrupted our game plan and made us struggle as Wong is a key player in our attack. We will analyse the game and correct our mistakes.\"\n\nRight back Sealy pulled a hamstring and was replaced by Chan Hing-kwong on 16 minutes while another young player, Lam Hok-hei, came on as a replacement 17 minutes later when Wong was stretchered off.\n\nKim said he would continue to give the young players chances in regional tournaments such as the Interport Cup. \"You cannot expect immediate results if you want to develop young players. I gave players like Leung Nok-hang, Augusto Leung Ka-hei and Chuck Yiu-kwok a chance in the Interport Cup and they are key players for the forthcoming Olympic qualifiers,\" Kim said.\n\nGuangdong should have won the match easily, but missed two goalscoring chances through Yang Chaosheng, a member of the China Olympic squad.\n\nGuangdong coach Chen Yuliang said his squad had improved from their last game with better match fitness. Tactically they closed down Hong Kong in midfield and never allowed the hosts any chances to launch speedy counterattacks.\n\n\"We were the better side today, but just failed to put the ball into the net, despite creating many chances,\" said Chen. \"We felt sorry for the Hong Kong player who suffered an injury due to a tackle. But it was never reckless as our players only go for the ball.\""
