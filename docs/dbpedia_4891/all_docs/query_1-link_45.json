        "text": "Hobgoblin was a heavyweight robot which competed in Series 9 and 10 of Robot Wars. At a cost of £1400, it was built by Harry Hills, who competed in Series 8 as part of Team Legion, although drive problems and a lack of a self-righting mechanism led to Hobgoblin falling in the first round of Series 9, while faulty batteries hindered it in both of its Series 10 losses.\n\nDesign[]\n\nHobgoblin's weapon is referred to as an ‘egg beater’, a popular weapon in lower weight classes, but was the first of its kind to be seen on Robot Wars, and is a rarity for heavyweight robots in general. The beater weighed 20kg with a spinning speed of 2500rpm, and was made from a plasmacut block of HARDOX 500. Rectangular-shaped with two teeth on one side and one longer tooth on the other, the beater had a diameter of 250mm, and was driven by a 24 Volt, 4 Kilowatt Lynch 170 motor to deliver a tip speed of 80mph in Series 9, and 90mph in Series 10. Hobgoblin was four-wheel driven, and its 5-inch wheels were custom-made from plastic billet, wrapped in cut-down bike tyre for extra traction. In Series 9, both the weapon and drive system are powered by 4x 6s (22.2v) Lithium Polymer batteries.\n\nOriginally, Hobgoblin was built on a budget of £1400. Hobgoblin's frame was made from 4-8mm HARDOX and water-cut high-grade aluminium; 30, 25 and 20mm. The outer shell was mostly made from watercut HARDOX, and for Series 10, 1 inch thick sheet of HDPE was added to the sides. In Series 9, it ran on 24V, 500W lawnmower motors for a top speed of 9mph, but these were replaced with brushed DC motors in Series 10 for a top speed of 12mph, and the batteries were improved to more powerful 29.6v Drive 8s Lipos[1][2].\n\nAt the time of Series 9, Hobgoblin featured a front wedge, designed to lead robots into the egg beater, which was made from a single sheet of HARDOX. However, this wedge was replaced with a toothed face Series 10, allowing the beater to make contact immediately, made from 10mm thick steel, with a couple of HDPE blocks to protect the wheels. The robot was mostly held together using bolts rather than welding. This wedge gave the robot extra ground clearance at the front, although it was removed for its second fight in the series.\n\nBoth versions of Hobgoblin suffered from not being able to run when inverted. The Series 9 version was theoretically invertible, but this failed to work in battle, so castor wheels were added to the top of Hobgoblin in Series 10. These allowed the robot to run inverted, although a combination of battery failure and melted castors still stopped Hobgoblin from moving freely while inverted.\n\nThe Team[]\n\nTeam Hobgoblin was captained by 20-year old R&D designer Harry Hills, who was aged just 19 in Series 9. The lead designer of Hobgoblin, Harry Hills was responsible for the construction of the machine, and drove the robot in Series 9, where he was joined by 57-year old father Paul. For Series 10, Harry Hills recruited two roboteers with experience in lower weight classes on the UK live circuit, with Matt Smith and Andy Russell joining the team, with Matt Smith also becoming the driver of Hobgoblin. Harry Hills had previously designed the Series 8 version of Sabretooth, and was present at filming as part of Team Legion.\n\nQualification[]\n\nHobgoblin applied for Series 9 through open applications, with the build starting roughly 2 and a half months before the competition. Notably, Hobgoblin was one of very few robots to qualify for Robot Wars using purely a computer-aided design, as the build process was not finished at this stage - typically most robots are not selected unless there is evidence of the build progress. Harry Hills had only acquired motors for the wheels and weapons and a battery when his application was accepted.\n\nThis left Harry with just 6 weeks to build the robot, and the build finished just three days before the team had to drive to Scotland for the filming.[3]\n\nDue to Series 10 reducing the number of competitors from 40 to 30, Hobgoblin narrowly missed out on the initial selection of competitors, although it was invited to attend filming as a reserve entry. Once Point Blank withdrew due to safety concerns, Hobgoblin became the last robot to earn its place in the series, after Tauron and Coyote had also been substituted in.\n\nRobot History[]\n\nSeries 9[]\n\nHobgoblin first competed in Heat B of Series 9, where it faced two powerful flipping weapons in Behemoth and Eruption, alongside Belgian entry Cobra. Before the fight, the team claimed that Hobgoblin could self-right in theory, but that this had not been tested. Additionally, the team encountered further worries, as changes to the robot's drive system instead made Hobgoblin incapable of turning, and its forward movement was limited - even entering the robot's starting position proved challenging.\n\nWhen the battle started, Hobgoblin quickly brought its weapon up to full speed, but its lack of speed meant that Hobgoblin could only meander around the arena. It was charged by Behemoth, although Hobgoblin survived this attack. However, Eruption then drove under it and flipped Hobgoblin over. Carried by the force of its egg beater, Hobgoblin came to rest beside the arena side wall and could not self-right, where it was counted out. After a full three-minute fight, Behemoth and Eruption were declared the victors, and Hobgoblin fell alongside Cobra.\n\nSeries 10[]\n\nHobgoblin returned for Series 10 as a reserve entry, ultimately competing in Heat E as a substitute for the withdrawn Point Blank. In its Group Battle, it faced the new drum spinner from Team Ranglebots, Magnetar, and Team S.Tek's returning front-hinged flipper, Push to Exit. Hobgoblin entered the battle with its toothed front as protection against Magnetar's drum, despite knowing it would pose a disadvantage against Push to Exit.\n\nHobgoblin drove forwards in the opening stages, quickly spinning up its egg-beater, but Push to Exit quickly drove under the toothed face of Hobgoblin, as the team had feared, and threw it straight over, causing Hobgoblin to skid over the flame pit. One of Hobgoblin's castor wheels had become damaged by fire, so Hobgoblin lacked the drive power to leave the area in which it had been flipped. Hobgoblin managed to edge nearer to the flame pit, but could only slowly turn in circles on the robot's one functional castor wheel, and an immobilisation clock begun, rendering Hobgoblin immobile, having lost the battle to Magnetar despite never making contact with the drum spinner.\n\nIn the Robot Redemption Knockouts, Hobgoblin faced the runner-up of the Group Battle won by Thor, and the team's close friends, Coyote. Team Hobgoblin mockingly wrote \"Bite Me, Coyote\" onto their robot, surrounded by love hearts. However, one of Hobgoblin's batteries had shorted in-between battles, causing the power of the robot to drop from 16V to 4V, affecting Hobgoblin's other batteries in the process, which the team had not realised until entering the arena.\n\nAfter an opening collision between both robots, Hobgoblin was left reeling, and Coyote drove under the side of it to manoeuvre Hobgoblin towards the arena spikes. However, Hobgoblin was still struggling to gain control due to a slipped drive belt, and driver Matt Smith could not easily move his robot away from the raised pit.\n\nHobgoblin eventually reversed off, and hit Coyote's jaw with its egg beater moments before Coyote's minibot Roadrunner opened the pit. Seemingly unable to drive directly forwards, Hobgoblin backed into Coyote, and was pushed into various sections of the arena, wedged by Coyote's lifter.\n\nCoyote dragged Hobgoblin near to the centre of the arena, where Hobgoblin managed to rip some pipework from Coyote, but it could not leave its own circumference before Coyote drove it into the reach of Sir Killalot, although Hobgoblin was able to buckle and damage the House Robot's claw. Coyote held Hobgoblin over the flame pit, and pulled away a drive belt from Hobgoblin, while Hobgoblin failed to move away from its position, eventually shearing a keyway in the robot's drive. Coyote edged Hobgoblin into the CPZ, and the damaged Sir Killalot left in order for Shunt to barge in, driving Hobgoblin into the corner of the arena and repeatedly strike it with axe blows, striking both the robot and the egg beater itself.\n\nAlthough Hobgoblin was immobile, and Shunt landed further axe blows, Hobgoblin managed to earn some vengeance, as when Shunt landed a direct blow on Hobgoblin's spinning weapon, the egg beater ripped the entire titanium tip from Shunt's axe, shattering it across the arena. While Hobgoblin was being counted out, Shunt flipped Hobgoblin over using its scoop, and left it in the corner of the arena until 'cease' was called. Hobgoblin was eliminated at this stage, but left the competition on a high note.\n\nResults[]\n\nHOBGOBLIN - RESULTS Series 9 Series 9 - UK Championship\n\nHeat, Round 1 Heat B, Group Battle vs. Behemoth, Cobra, Eruption Eliminated Series 10 Series 10 - UK Championship\n\nRobot Redemption Knockouts Heat E, Group Battle vs. Magnetar, Push to Exit Lost Heat E, Robot Redemption vs. Coyote Lost\n\nWins/Losses[]\n\nWins: 0\n\nLosses: 3\n\nSeries Record[]\n\nSeries Hobgoblin Series Record Series 1-7 Did not enter Series 8 Entered with Sabretooth Series 9 Heat, Round 1 Series 10 Heat, Round 1\n\nNOTE: Team member Matt Smith attempted to enter Series 8-9 with Phantom, and Series 10 with Crowd Control, but was never selected to compete.\n\nGallery[]\n\nOutside Robot Wars[]\n\nHobgoblin[]\n\nHobgoblin did not make a combat appearance again after its time on Robot Wars, and has remained with teammate Matt Smith since this time. Hobgoblin was among various former Robot Wars competitors which appeared at Robonerd as a static display in September 2018.\n\nHarry Hills[]\n\nBefore involving himself with heavyweight robots to compete on Robot Wars, Harry Hills mostly participated in featherweight competitions prior to the show's reboot. Featherweight robots built by Harry Hills include two versions of Flatpack, a four-bar lifter, and Massacre, an overhead bar spinner built in 2014-15.\n\nHarry Hills has also built a number of antweight robots, including a 150g replica of Hypno-Disc, and also started to build a raptorweight robot armed with a drum spinner. Due to a lack of raptorweight competitions, Harry Hills sold the drum spinner to Thomas Long for use in Halcyon, and instead used the raptorweight as a prototype for his third featherweight, Thinking with Portals. This was a 13.6kg clusterbot made up of identical, near-invertible robots armed with egg beater spinners. Harry Hills also built the featherweight robot GERTY for Rachel Gibson.\n\nHarry Hills later helped Simon Harrison to build King Buxton 20, and competed as part of the team at RoboGames 2018, where it was defeated by the experienced Touro Maximus and Megalodon. The pair collaborated to design a new eggbeater heavyweight, Monster, which was submitted to, but not selected for an unspecified season of King of Bots. Monster would ultimately not materialise beyond CAD drawings prepared by Hills from a concept devised by Harrison.[5] In 2021, both would unite once again to form Team Sabotage along with Mark Mellors and Jamie McHarg,[6] who applied for that year's season of BattleBots with Hoodlum. A four-wheel drive heavyweight armed with an undercutter (depicted in one render as a four-toothed blade paying homage to Pussycat's weapon), Hoodlum would not be selected for that season, a matter confirmed by the King B Facebook page in May along with its planned design.[7]\n\nAside from combat robots, Harry Hills has also worked on a number of RC car projects.\n\nMatt Smith[]\n\nMatt Smith is a former owner of Eric from the original series, with success in the beetleweight category. Matt Smith has also been in possession of Hobgoblin since Series 10 was filmed, although Harry Hills still owns the machine. For more information on Matt Smith's excursions outside of Robot Wars, see Phantom.\n\nAndy Russell[]\n\nAndy Russell is primarily a roboteer in the featherweight division. His first robot was Push and Shove, a ramming robot which reached the Top 6 of the UK Featherweight Championship. Russell's second robot was Ion a beetleweight robot armed with a spinning drum, where the weapon motor was housed. Adam Russell's next project was Pendulum, a robot armed with a 3.2kg TOOLOX 'egg beater' which spins at 6000rpm. The robot was protected by single piece billet aluminium wheelguards. At the UK featherweight championship in 2016, Pendulum won all of its round robin battles bar two (both of which were against the eventual champion Explosion) and defeated Tormenta at the UK Featherweight Championship in 2016, winning the majority of its round robin battles. Andy Russell also created Ion's successor, Ion 2, at a later stage.\n\nAndy Russell next built Telekinesis, an invertible undercutter using watercut HARDOX armour, which competes to this day, occasionally referred to as Telekinesis 1.5. Its discs are interchangeable, including a bar spinner configuration. At the King of Bots UK Featherweight Championship, Telekinesis won its first battle against Little Devil and Nigel Barrage by knockout, but lost its second melee to Tempest, finishing second. Telekinesis lost its Judges' decision against Nelly the Ellybot, but after finishing second place again, Telekinesis qualified for the Top 20. However, it withdrew prior to its battle with Little Devil, and was replaced by Orpheus, eliminating Telekinesis at this stage.\n\nA repainted silver Telekinesis competed at the Robodojo Autumn Featherweight Championship in November 2018. It lost its first battle after driving onto the lip of the pit, and collected a win by default over X-303, but ultimately withdrew due to a lack of spare wheels. Telekinesis returned for the January 2019 event, and lost its first two fights, driving into the pit and then losing its removable link in each fight; however, Telekinesis redeemed this by causing significant damage to Get Shrekt, forcing it to retire from the event, and also defeated P.I.P. to earn fifth place in the full combat class. At the March 2019 event, Telekinesis suffered an early loss to Plastic Fantastic, but collected three straight wins against Binky, Vega and Raving Luna-Tic to qualify for the third place play-off, losing to Graffiti there as its spinner was not working. Telekinesis had an unfortunate run at Robodojo in July 2019, suffering defeats to Sawcerer, X-303 and Get Shrekt. It would continue to compete at Robodojo in the following years, as recently as January 2023.\n\nFor the UK Featherweight Championship in 2019, Andy Russell built a third version of Telekinesis, sporting a new yellow blade. Although it earned destructive victories over Frycook and Red Hot Tilly Pecker, it was forced to withdraw from battles against Captain Jack Spinnah and Galaga, and was resigned to fourth place in its group after losing to Venator 3. Nevertheless, Telekinesis competed in the Annihilator where it achieved third place. Telekinesis also competed in every edition of Labman FightFest until 2024, finishing fourth in the Annihilator Cup at the FightFest Winter Challenge, and finishing fourth place overall in the main 2023 championship under Rachel Gibson and Brooke Reay.\n\nIn 2022, Andy Russell would build the 6.4kg drum spinner Semtex, which won the Hobbyweight Championship at FightFest that year, and also competed in the 12lb division in Norwalk Havoc Robot League with mixed success. It would return to the FightFest Hobbyweight division in 2024.\n\nSemtex would later be upscaled to a featherweight design, with Andy Russell building Nitro in 2024. This would prove to be Andy Russell's most successful robot to date, winning every individual Robodojo live event of the year to take the overall title, critically also winning the FightFest heavyweight competition in 2023, defeating Killi Pepper in the Grand Final, and its own predecessor Telekinesis in the prior round. Nitro would also compete at NHRL in 2024, qualifying for the December Grand Final.\n\nIn 2023, Andy would make a Beetleweight vertical spinner named Propane, which notably uses a counter-gyro vert to help it with turning. It has proven to be successful, notably winning the BBB Beetle Brawl 2024.\n\nAndy Russell often assisted Adam Hamilton with the creation of commission-based robots, and both competed as part of Team Immersion in the Chinese show This is Fighting Robots with the heavyweight Bonfire. Andy Russell also joined Team RC Kev to compete in King of Bots II with Switch.\n\nTo compete in the planned 2020 season of BattleBots, Andy Russell joined a German-led team to enter the show with multibot Jäger, though had to withdraw due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the project, Andy Russell built a scaled-up version of Telekinesis with various undercutting spinners, which could also fight as a legal UK middleweight. Andy Russell was to be the team captain of Jäger in Season 6 of BattleBots, but this role soon returned to Ralf Schneider after travel restrictions prevented all British roboteers from attending the filming. Andy Russell's robot would be named Toe Kicker at filming and was driven by Emmanuel Carillo, driver of Big Dill. In its first fight, Jäger fought P1, although Toe Kicker was forced to largely fight alone after the other half of Jäger (Arm Muscle) was disabled early on, with P1 eventually stranding Toe Kicker against the Upper Deck for a win by knockout. Jäger was also unsuccessful in its second fight against Captain Shrederator, ending its season at an 0-2 record. Jäger was not selected to compete in the following season, though Andy Russell did attend BattleBots for the first time as a member of the Big Dill team.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBefore setting on the design, Hills had also created CAD renders of an invertible Hobgoblin with an egg beater, and a version with an undercutting spinner[8].\n\nDuring the construction of Hobgoblin, Harry Hills 3D printed two scale models of Hobgoblin based on his CAD designs.\n\nIn August 2024, one of these models was listed for sale on eBay[9].\n\nHobgoblin and its builder contribute two key elements of the introduction to every Series 9 episode. Harry Hills spoke his \"don't panic, and try not to die\" motto, while Hobgoblin's beater was also dropped onto a table in video footage taken from the team's unused VT.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nHarry Makes Things blog - Hobgoblin Series 9 build log\n\nHarry Makes Things blog - Hobgoblin Series 10 build log\n\nHarry Makes Things Facebook page\n\nHobgoblin (Series 9) on the Robot Wars website\n\nHobgoblin (Series 10) on the Robot Wars website"
