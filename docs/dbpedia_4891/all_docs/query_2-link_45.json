        "text": "The year 2024 begins against a backdrop of escalating tensions in the South China Sea, a situation likely to persist. Although recent meetings between Xi Jinping and Western leaders have kindled hopes for mitigating economic strains, Beijing confronts intricate challenges closer to home. China’s ambitions to dominate the South China Sea are met with growing opposition, notably from the Philippines. With Southeast Asia emerging as a strategic focus, Beijing must intensify its diplomatic efforts to maintain its influence in the region and prevent Southeast Asian nations from aligning too closely with the United States.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe Philippines won’t back down. Chinese aspirations in the South China Sea are no secret, Beijing has steadily expanded its presence in the disputed waters. In this regard, the Chinese government recently published an updated territorial map, in which the renowned Nine-dash line – which marks the country’s territorial waters according to Beijing claims – has extended to become a “Ten-dash line”. China’s expansive claims have been met with widespread opposition from the other claimant countries overlooking the SCS, with the Philippines taking a particularly assertive stance over the past year. To resist the encroachment into its national waters, Philippines vessels and coastguard have faced-off with Chinese vessels on multiple occasions. Recent confrontations saw the Philippines authorities accusing a Chinese vessel of employing water cannons to forcefully repel Philippine ships near the Second Thomas Shoal. While such incidents would have been resolved diplomatically not too long ago, both Manila and the Philippines are standing their ground and are accusing the other part of illegal conduct in their territorial waters, with China warning Manila of being careful with its accusations.\n\nTaiwan elections take the centre stage. Taiwan’s upcoming January 13 elections represent another layer of uncertainty for Beijing. While provocations in the Taiwan Strait persist as a regular occurrence, the domestic landscape within Taiwan appears increasingly uncertain. At the polls the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), led by outgoing President Tsai Ing-Wen and her candidate Lai Ching-te, may face quite a challenging competition from opposition parties. The outcome of this election carries profound implications for Taiwan-China relations, especially given the Kuomintang’s more friendly stance toward China, with its candidate Hou Yu-ih seen as a more amenable figure by Beijing. While the DPP pledges to continue Tsai policy toward China, strengthening ties with the US and reinforcing deterrence capabilities, the KMT sees an increased cooperation with China as the way forward to decrease tension in the strait. The current scenario suggests that even if the DPP secures victory at the polls, it may struggle to attain a parliamentary majority, limiting its ability to dictate its political agenda with ease. This dynamic is notably advantageous for Xi’s China, as it places the party less aligned with Chinese interference in Taiwan in a challenging position\n\nThe courting of Vietnam. Southeast Asia is emerging as a pivotal region, drawing the attention of major global players eager to engage more with ASEAN nations. At the forefront of this diplomatic dance is Vietnam, a nation whose promising market has become a magnet for investments from countries seeking to diversify their value chains – particularly those seeking to reduce over-reliance on China. Biden recent visit to Vietnam is part of the US subtle charm offensive to strengthen ties with Indo Pacific partners. An important milestone was reached as the US and Vietnam elevated their relations to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, a culmination of years of progressively deepening cooperation in both economic and military realms. China does not appreciate Washington efforts to increase its influence in the region and has planned a similar visit to reaffirm that China remains Vietnam’s crucial strategic partner. Beijing retains its position as Vietnam’s largest trading partner, and the two nations have committed to forging a “China-Vietnam Community with a shared future.” While the US is making strides, it remains to be seen how quickly it can replace China, if at all. China, in turn, must navigate the intricate dance to maintain close ties with Hanoi, which is increasingly capturing the attention of international rivals. All of this while Hanoi is trying to capitalize on this window of opportunity to increase its international partnerships and economic agreements.\n\nOur take\n\nThe countries in the South China Sea will undoubtedly take centre stage in the political landscape of 2024, emphasizing the region’s increasing significance in international politics. As a result of this increased centrality, China is poised to navigate multiple challenges: from a much-needed domestic economic revival, continued wariness from the West towards Beijing, and potential complications in the South China Sea. While the first two issues have already demanded considerable attention from the Beijing administration in recent years, the South China Sea has hardly ever presented a such vast array of uncertainties lying in wait at Xi’s doorstep. Taiwan is set to remain a source of uncertainty for China. As tensions with the United States heighten and Taipei tries to strengthen ties the West, Beijing pins its hopes on a favourable outcome of the coming elections with the victory of more amicable Kuomintang. The Philippines, once inclined to accommodate Chinese ambitions under the previous Duterte administration, has shifted gears under Marcos. It has rejected submissiveness and bolstered its military ties with Washington, making a heightened US presence in the South China Sea a less-than-desirable scenario for Xi. While Vietnam may not currently pose a major problem for China, the effort required to maintain such a crucial ally close might prove more substantial than Xi initially anticipated. In general, the region is set to be central within the context of the great power competition: for the US strategic and economic ties with South-Est Asia will be crucial in achieving de-risking and containment from China. The regional countries have the opportunity to leverage their balancing role to gain economic and strategic benefits.\n\nExperts’ views\n\nThe Taiwanese elections are likely to result in the DPP continuing to remain in power. Although China is expected to continue with military threats directed at Taiwan, this means Taiwan will continue with its current maintenance of the status quo, while seeking to shore up relations with western countries. This, too, will mean continuing to try and strengthen economic relations with southeast Asian countries to reduce trade dependency on China. By contrast, if the KMT goes back to power, it has indicated that it will return to previous policies of economic engagement with China. As for the region more broadly, a DPP-led administration will also see attempts to shore up security relationships with potential allies in the event of a Chinese invasion. It is less clear what would occur if a KMT administration came to power, with the KMT mostly emphasizing a return to focus on China, and less clarity on relations with other regional countries. It may be that a KMT administration would place most of its foreign policy efforts on renewing relations with China.\n\nBrian Hioe, New Bloom Magazine\n\nThe South China Sea dispute is a multiparty row, but tensions between the Philippines and China are the most prominent. Untoward sea incidents between the two neighbours pile up, straining bilateral ties. Manila is the loudest but has the weakest position in the flashpoint. Short in firepower, the country leaned on international law, its longstanding alliance with Washington, and diplomacy to defend its position. Manila adopted a strategy of exposing China’s illicit and disruptive activities in choppy waters and expanded security cooperation with the US, as well as with Japan, Australia, and other partners. But China remains undeterred and has become even bolder in challenging its smaller neighbour’s maritime claim. Such growing security pressure and potential economic fallout make Manila’s move unlikely to be embraced by other littoral states, which may prefer more discreet dialogue to avoid rocking the boat as their economic interdependence with China deepens. This shows how the salience of the maritime spat and risk tolerance varies across regional countries and how they inform approaches to the hotspot.\n\nLucio Blanco Pitlo III, Asia-Pacific Pathways to Progress\n\nSpotlight: Indonesia’s elections\n\nIn the year of pivotal elections, Indonesia, currently under the leadership of Joko Widodo, is gearing up to elect a new president and vice president. The vast electorate of 205 million Indonesians will have the opportunity to select their representatives between three candidates. One contender is Prabowo Subianto, the current Minister of Defense, whose running mate is Widodo’s own son, Gibran Raka. The contender from the ruling party is Ganjar Pranowo, pledging to uphold a degree of policy continuity from his predecessor. The last candidate is Anies Baswedan who has vowed to abandon Widodo’s $33 billion project for building a new capital city. According to recent pools, Subianto is in the lead for his popularity surged after the announcement of Raka as his running mate. Despite over two decades of democratic governance, Indonesian political life remains firmly in the hands of business and military elites, a legacy shaped during the 30-year dictatorship of Suharto. Notably, Widodo broke the norm as the first outsider to ascend to such a position of power. However, with the prospect of his son’s potential election, a new political dynasty appears to be taking shape on the Indonesian horizon not dissimilar to the pre-existing ones.\n\nWHAT AND WHERE\n\nMyanmar: Operation 1027 and China’s handiwork\n\nNearly three years since its onset, the civil war in Myanmar persists, marked by ongoing clashes between the military junta and rebel factions. The Tatmadaw forces have been experiencing setbacks in since October due to the Operation 1027 orchestrated by the Three Brotherhood Alliance. This coalition comprises the Arakan Army (AA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). Starting from the Northern regions of Myanmar, where Chinese influence is significant, the alliance has successfully seized control of numerous national army bases, all without intervention from China. China’s role in the ongoing crisis is thus intriguing. Historically, Beijing maintained strong ties not only with the military junta, being its major arms supplier, but also with different ethnic groups in in Myanmar – particularly those with which it shares a border as a way to ensuring stability. Initially supporting the junta during the first stages of the coup, China’s stance seems to have evolved as the Tatmadaw struggled to assert its control and struggles to close down the online scam centers on their shared borders. Despite rumours of a change in China’s position, Beijing continues economic and diplomatic relations with the military junta and has managed to bring the major factions in the conflict to the negotiation table, resulting in an agreement to a temporary ceasefire. Despite this, fighting persists in the country, with rebel forces seizing the positive momentum following Operation 1027 to expand their territorial control.\n\nElections in Bangladesh amid protests and boycotts\n\nOn January the 7th, Bangladesh will elect its national representatives, yet the outcome of the election appears clear as the major opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is boycotting the election by opting out of it. Indeed, in October protests erupted, led by the BNP and the Islamist party Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, with the demonstrators calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who leads the Bangladesh Awami League (BAL). The demands for the Prime Minister’s resignation originated from a push to restore the practice of appointing a caretaker government during election periods to ensure fair conduct, a system constitutionally established in 1996 but abolished under Prime Minister Hasina’s leadership in 2011. However, the protests were met with forceful repression by the armed forces. In the aftermath of the protests, the Bangladeshi government intensified its crackdown on opposition forces, exacerbating the already tense political climate leading up to the elections. Accused by the opposition of manipulating the 2018 elections, Hasina’s party, which has held power since 2009, is anticipated to emerge victorious. The political landscape suggests a continuation of the incumbent party’s dominance in the upcoming elections: the BAL has close ties to influential elites, its authoritarian leadership has curtailed citizens’ freedom of expression for years, and the fragmentation of opposition forces presents a weak contending front.\n\nJapan Explores Defense Industry Partnerships with the UK and Italy\n\nAs Japan seeks to rapidly build up its military capabilities in the face of growing concerns about its geopolitical environment, the country is also striving to expand its international partnerships in the defense industry. In mid-December the government of the UK, Japan, and Italy signed a treaty to officially establish the programme that will provide the three countries with a new generation of fighter jets. The programme, named Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), is the first international defense project undertaken by Japan together with nations other than the US. Under this partnership, Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, UK’s BAE Systems, and Italy’s Leonardo will jointly develop a new fighter jet that is expected to enter into service by 2035 to replace the currently operational US-Japanese F-2s and British Tempests. Yet, more challenges lie ahead, as Japan long-standing ban on exporting arms would make it difficult for the project to turn into an economy of scale and export the fighter jets to third countries. The Japanese government is working to relax the strict rules for defense equipment transfers, but so far the revision has been out of reach due to political divergences between the ruling LDP and its coalition ally Komeito, which remains cautious about promoting weapons exports.\n\nNuclear deterrence rapidly becoming a hot topic in the Korean peninsula\n\nTensions are not expected to ease in the Korean peninsula as the rival republics continue to build up their own nuclear deterrence. On the 18th December North Korea fired its fifth ICBM of the year, capable of targeting anywhere in the continental US, as a warning to Washington not to make “wrong decisions”. Pyongyang is taking issue with the increased US-South Korea military cooperation taking place under Presidente Yoon Suk-yeol: over the last few months the US began to sail nuclear submarines to South Korean ports to reaffirm its commitment to their military alliance. In the same vein, on the 15th of December South Korea and the US gathered for the second meeting of the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG), which brought together around 60 security, military, and diplomatic officials from the two sides. The group – launched in April as a tool to strengthen the credibility of US defense commitment to South Korea – agreed to establish guidelines for a shared nuclear strategy by the summer of 2024, which is expected to strengthen the South Korean involvement in the planning and operational activities connected to the US nuclear assurances. Yet, too many South Koreans those assurances may not look as steadfast as they are now proclaimed to be, as the political comeback of Donald Trump remains a possibility in next year’s US presidential elections.\n\nTREND\n\nDiscourse over artificial intelligence is dominating the political agenda as leaders try to find ways to regulate. As AI revenue market is set to grow twentyfold in the coming decade, the tech race to control the further development of this technology is unfolding. Currently, the United States holds a leading position in AI, driven by substantial private sector investments totaling over $248 billion between 2013 and 2022, as reported by the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2023. However, notable challengers are emerging, particularly China, which invested over $96 billion in the same period, including $13.4 billion in 2022 alone. China’s AI sector has seen exponential growth and development in recent years. The US and China continue their predominance also in the Global AI Index – which assigns a score to each country according to three pillars of analysis, namely Investment, Innovation and Implementation. An interesting result of this index is Singapore: now third on the list, just in 2020 it was barely making the top 10, demonstrating the level of interest and willingness to invest of the country in AI. Thus, while the US and China are still dominant players in the sector, other nations are currently trying to develop their AI industrial base – such as India, the UK or South Korea – might increase collaboration to reach the top spot.\n\nWHAT WE ARE READING"
