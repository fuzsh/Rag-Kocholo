        "text": "According to his Wikipedia page, Andrew Russell’s only career honour is the 2014 Lancashire Challenge Cup.\n\nThe defender’s time in English football was modest, to say the least. He played for Woodley Sports, Mossley, Chorley and AFC Fylde, across the seventh and eighth tiers of the pyramid.\n\nBut now, aged 31, five years after refusing to accept being told that football was only a hobby and he needed to focus on the 9-5, he is primed for his debut in the Chinese Super League.\n\nEarlier this year, Southampton-born Russell put pen to paper on a deal with mega-rich Hebei China Fortune, a side managed by Chris Coleman.\n\nIn the space of half a decade, he has gone from twice-a-week training sessions alongside plumbers, personal trainers and teachers, to cracking jokes with Argentina internationals Javier Mascherano and Ezequiel Lavezzi across the table at lunchtime.\n\n“You are almost trying to rationalise things that are absolutely not normal for someone who has come from where I have come from,” Russell said, who earned just £60-a-week when he played for Woodley.\n\n“I have been conscious since I moved here not to be too overwhelmed or too starstruck, because if you start the whole time thinking ‘I used to play non-league against 150 people or 200 people’ then you are looking backwards as oppose to forwards.\n\n“Although it is totally surreal, it becomes the new norm and you are trying to put yourself on a level with these guys as best as you can and work as hard as you can.\n\n“It is hard to explain. At the end of the day, they are just normal guys, which sounds a bit weird but you do not want to become overwhelmed and taken back by the situation, because if you do that they you are never going to show your best or play your best.”\n\nRussell was a shrewd signing by Hebei in February, due to his ability to waive the foreign player rule.\n\nHis family moved to Hong Kong aged two, making him eligible for a passport. Russell returned to England in his late teens for university, where he studied in Manchester, and forged a semi-professional football career in the north.\n\nBut it was at the age of 26, and one particular day in work, where Russell realised that juggling full-time work and non-league football was not for him.\n\n“I went to a training day in Leeds,” he recalled. “I had to leave my house at 7am, get myself to Leeds, then I had to tell the guy who was leading the course that I had to leave to go for this football game.\n\n“He gave me a proper dressing down. I remember it really clearly. He told me that football is only my hobby and that this is my career, what are you doing?\n\n“So I took that, he let me go and I went down to Rushall Olympic. We drew 1-1, I got back in the car and got home at about 1am that night and I just thought there has got to be more to life than this.\n\n“That was my last season in the UK.\n\n“That day, coupled with my wife and my mentor helping me understand what my goals were and what I want to achieve, pushed me to explore.”\n\nRussell saw a friend playing for Hong Kong-based South China in the Barclays Asia Trophy against the likes of Manchester City and Tottenham in front of 40,000 people and wanted a piece of the action.\n\nAfter a successful trial, he joined in 2014. It was four years later that Russell ventured to China, joining second-tier Liaoning Whowin, where a season of impressive performances saw him picked up by Hebei.\n\nBut the Chinese Super League is a far cry from the industrious non-league outposts where Russell cut his teeth.\n\nNow, his days are spent in the gym and on the training ground, eating the right foods and listening to every word of what Coleman’s coaching staff are telling him.\n\nAt 31, his lifestyle has had to become somewhat robotic, as he attempts to squeeze every last drop out of his relatively short professional career.\n\n“I just wish that I had been a little bit more dedicated and a little bit more professional during that part of my career,” Russell said, recalling his non-league days.\n\n“When I think about how I live my life now and how I lived my life in these last few years, which have allowed me to get to where I am now in terms of how hard I have worked and how professional I have been.\n\n“If I had applied myself properly back in those non-league days, then I am sure something would have come up further up the pyramid.\n\n“I could have great games and play to a good standard, but it would be a one in 10, I couldn’t find that consistency.\n\n“But I wasn’t living consistently in how hard I worked and in the processes that I was following day-by-day. The two go hand-in-hand and I learned that a little bit too late.\n\n“I still follow non-league and find out how my old teams are getting on, follow my old teammates and see how they are getting on, but I don’t think back too much about my own non-league time and if I do, I look back a little bit regretful and that I could have applied myself better.”\n\nSomewhat akin to Jamie Vardy’s rise from non-league, hard work and endeavour has helped Russell get to where he is today.\n\nBut with the Chinese Super League, many footballers making the move to Asia have been criticised for ‘only going for the money’.\n\n“That is the first thing people hear about,” Russell said. “But if people were to come and experience it and see first hand, they would see that it is actually a pretty impressive place to play.\n\n“There was a lot of talk of Arnautovic coming out, a lot of talk of Fellaini coming out, but I am a big advocate of the fact that there is a lot more to China football than just the money.\n\n“If anyone had come and watched our first league game, we only played one of the newly promoted teams, it was in an absolutely world class stadium and there were over 35,000 fans there.\n\n“The team is well supported and the facilities have been brilliant. Everything has been absolutely amazing.\n\n“You do get taken aback by it all, so there is a lot more to it than just the financial side of things.”\n\nHe added: “It is only going to be natural when the likes of Mousa Dembele, who has just signed from Tottenham, where he was playing with world class players every day, it is going to be a step down.\n\n“For me it is a very competitive league and the obvious thing is the top foreign players, but there are plenty of good local players here too.”\n\nA Hong Kong passport has also allowed Russell to venture into the international game, making his debut in a 2-0 loss away at Qatar in May 2016.\n\nAnd the experience of playing international football also brought with it an additional unexpected quirk: YouTube highlight compliations.\n\nThe title reads: ‘Andy Russell Defensive Skills VS Lebanon’, in the same way that his now-teammate Mascherano has dozens of videos celebrating his on-pitch achievements.\n\n“Ha ha… erm… I have to be honest, I have typed Andy Russell into YouTube before. I have to hold my hands up and admit I have seen it!\n\n“But all that stuff goes back to the surreal thing. You are playing with these players and these coaches and even when I first arrived in Hong Kong, you never believed that someone was going to make a video about you playing in an international game.\n\n“I just focus day-by-day on just training hard and over time, these things just happen.\n\n“It was never my aim or my goal or my wish that something like that would happen. It is not that big of a deal, but it is one of those things where you look back and you will think ‘that was pretty cool’ and something you can show your kids later in life.\n\n“From when I was playing non-league you would never dream of that. I remember we used to go mad because one player had a Wikipedia page and that was the coolest thing.\n\n“I was fortunate in my circumstances in that I grew up in Hong Kong and had a Hong Kong passport, but I always say it, here are huge opportunities outside of the UK and in Asia.\n\n“It is not just myself, there are a few other English players doing really well out in Asia and they have made that leap.\n\n“You have got to experience things and those kind of experiences that we are talking about now, which have become normal, I would have never had those opportunities in the UK.\n\n“It all comes from taking that leap of faith.”"
