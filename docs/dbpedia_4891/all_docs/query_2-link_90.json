        "text": "MANILA: The Philippines and Germany committed on Sunday to finalizing a defense cooperation agreement this year, saying they strongly opposed expansive claims in the South China Sea amid continued tensions with Beijing in the disputed waters.\n\nGerman Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was in Manila to meet with his Philippine counterpart Gilberto Teodoro Jr. to enhance ties between their countries, which are celebrating 70 years of diplomatic relations.\n\nThey agreed to establish long-term relations between their armed forces to expand training and bilateral exchanges, explore opportunities to expand armaments partnerships and engage in joint projects.\n\nIn a joint statement, the ministers said they “strongly opposed any unilateral attempt to advance expansive claims, especially through force or coercion,” alluding to recent incidents in the South China Sea.\n\nThe Philippines and China have overlapping claims in the strategic waters along with a few other countries, but maritime confrontations between China Coast Guard ships and Philippine vessels have increased in recent months.\n\nIn June, Manila said the China Coast Guard rammed and boarded Philippine naval vessels during their resupply mission on the Second Thomas Shoal, part of the contested waters that has become a central flashpoint between the two countries.\n\n“There is only one cause of conflict in the South China Sea … It is China’s illegal and unilateral attempt to appropriate most, if not all, of the South China Sea as their internal waters,” Teodoro said during a press conference.\n\n“The Philippines is not provoking China. We do not seek war, yet we are mandated not only by our constitution but as an obligation to our countrymen to protect whatever areas, whether be jurisdiction or rights, that rightfully belong to the exclusive benefit of Filipinos.”\n\nManila and Berlin took measures to deepen their military ties just days after the US announced $500 million in military funding to modernize the Philippine army, an ongoing effort that will also see Manila “looking to engage Germany as a possible supplier,” Teodoro said.\n\n“These are in the command and control, anti-access aerial denial, maritime domain, aerial domain and in higher technologically capable equipment,” he added.\n\nPistorius, whose visit on Sunday was the first such trip by a German defense minister, underscored his country’s support for the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, which said that Beijing’s claims had no legal basis.\n\nThe decision, which was based on the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea, was rejected by China.\n\n“This ruling remains valid without any exceptions. It is our obligation to strengthen the maritime order, and we are living up to it,” Pistorius said, adding that countries must contribute to de-escalation efforts by keeping “all channels of communication open,” including with China.\n\n“It is important that we support and protect the rules-based international order in what we’re doing here. Our commitments and engagements here are not directed against anybody but instead, we’re focusing on maintaining the rules-based international order, securing freedom of navigation and protecting trade routes.”\n\nFor Manila, stronger defense ties with Germany are “important as a symbol of the Philippines’ growing security network” at the global level, said retired US Air Force Col. Raymond Powell, a director at Sealight, a project based in Stanford University that focuses on maritime transparency.\n\n“It carries fewer material benefits than its relationships with established Indo-Pacific powers like the US, Japan and France, but it is important (in) showing the Philippines as an integral member of a strong global community with significant economic resources and military capabilities,” Powell told Arab News.\n\nAaron Jed Rabena, a senior lecturer at the Asian Center of the University of the Philippines, said strengthening relations with Germany was a strategic move for Manila.\n\n“This is part of the Philippines’ strategy to broaden its web of security partners and get as much defense and political support from them as possible,” he told Arab News.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if Germany will soon take part in military exercises and even talk of a VFA (visiting forces agreement) with the Philippines.”\n\nLONDON: A Muslim man was hailed as a hero after he intervened in a knife attack in London’s busy theater district on Monday and helped to save the victims.\n\nAn 11-year-old girl and a 34-year-old woman were injured in the assault, which followed a week of far-right, anti-immigration riots across England targeting mosques and accommodation for asylum seekers.\n\nSocial media users were quick to highlight the fact that the man who stepped in tackle the attacker was Muslim. The BBC identified the good Samaritan as a 29-year-old named Abdullah who works as a security guard at the TWG Tea shop in Leicester Square. He told the broadcaster how he and his colleagues subdued the attacker and provided first aid to the child.\n\n“I heard a scream and went outside to see a man with a knife,” Abdullah said. “The moment I saw it, I just jumped on him, grabbed his hand, put him down on the floor and kicked the knife away. I had no time, I just didn’t think.”\n\nOther men rushed to help, he added, and they held the knifeman down for “four to five” minutes until help arrived.\n\n“It’s horrible, to be honest,” Abdullah said. “I’ve never seen anything like that before. To do this to a kid, it’s horrible.”\n\nHe added that he and his colleagues gave first aid to the child before the emergency services took over. Police said the girl suffered “serious” but not life-threatening injuries, while the woman’s wounds were “more minor.”\n\nAbullah said: “I just saw a kid getting stabbed and I tried to save her. It’s my duty to save them,” he said.\n\nIn a comment on a post on Instagram about the incident, user @edenmorissey said: “We need more people like Abdullah!!!”\n\nSeveral people praised Abdullah while accusing the media of bias in failing to report the stabbing more widely. Instagram user @sophinakhanartistry wrote: “What a HERO!!!! Where’s the mainstream news about a brown, MUSLIM person saving lives?!\"\n\n@fvneralmoonx wrote: “Another example of male violence against women, and yet the far right will be silent, like they weren’t rioting for our ‘women and children’ the other week.”\n\nAfter the incidents last week, police said they were prepared for further riots over the weekend, though in the event there was no further significant, widespread unrest.\n\nMinisters remained on high alert, however, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office saying the government’s work in dealing with the fallout from the riots was far from over.\n\nRIYADH: Mahdi, a 12-year-old boy from Gabon, has made a remarkable impression at the 44th King Abdulaziz International Qur’an Competition in Makkah, competing just two years after embracing Islam, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Monday.\n\nMahdi is currently the only Muslim in his family and his mentor Zakaria, an imam at a nearby mosque, told of his surprise when Mahdi first approached him, accompanied by his younger brother, to express his desire to embrace Islam.\n\n“At first I thought he was joking,” Zakaria admitted, recalling how unexpected it was given Mahdi’s young age.\n\n“I asked if he knew anything about Islam, and he kept insisting that he wanted to follow the religion of Allah. In my heart I said ‘This is a gift from Allah’.”\n\nZakaria guided Mahdi through the Shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith, and felt profound gratitude for being part of Mahdi’s spiritual journey.\n\nHe then began teaching Mahdi the Arabic alphabet, gradually progressing to short Qur’anic surahs (chapters) until Mahdi had memorized a quarter of the Qur’an.\n\n“I noticed how quickly he memorized and understood the Qur’an,” Zakaria said, highlighting that Mahdi was memorizing a page a day just a week after his conversion.\n\nAlongside his Qur’anic studies, Mahdi has also memorized various Islamic texts, showcasing his aptitude for learning.\n\n“He is truly a unique young man, unlike any I have ever seen,” Zakaria said, praising Mahdi’s extraordinary dedication.\n\nLONDON: The Muslim World League secretary-general on Monday launched a package of development and training schemes in Malawi to mark International Youth Day.\n\nMohammed bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa also announced the hosting of the first Qur’an memorization competition to be held in Tanzania.\n\nOther initiatives included the African Youth Parliament, which is scheduled to be held on Saturday at the Kenyan Parliament's headquarters, and the Africa Youth Forum 2024, which will be hosted at the UN headquarters in Nairobi on Thursday.\n\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera praised Al-Issa and the MWL for providing relief to alleviate climate change-induced suffering in the southern African nation.\n\nSpeaking in Lilongwe during activities held to mark the 25th anniversary of MWL operations in the country, Chakwera said that following the declaration of a state of disaster in 23 of the country’s 28 districts four months ago, the organization responded swiftly through food aid, which he said saved many lives.\n\n“Your humanitarian gesture extended to this country for the past 25 years in areas of relief and education has meant a lot to the people of this country. As a nation, we don’t take this gesture for granted,” Chakwera said.\n\nHe added that it was “pleasing to note that you are here serving every human being without consideration of faith. This is laudable.”\n\nChakwera said that about 5 million Malawians were suffering due to the El-Nino-induced drought that hit the country this year, “rendering government helpless to manage the situation alone”.\n\nAl-Issa said that the MWL is committed to partnering with the Malawian government to “make the country a better place for all, regardless of their economic status.”\n\nHe added: “For the past 25 years, as a government, you have made it possible for us to work freely in this country without any hindrances. We are very grateful for this spirit.”\n\nKOLKATA: India has arrested nearly a dozen Bangladeshis attempting to cross the border to escape violence and political tumult following deadly protests that led to the ouster of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, border officials said Monday.\n\nHundreds more are waiting along the frontier pleading for permission to cross, India’s Border Security Force (BSF) said.\n\nHindus are the largest minority faith in mostly Muslim Bangladesh, and are considered a steadfast support base for Hasina’s party, the Awami League.\n\nAfter Hasina’s abrupt resignation and escape to India ended her 15 years of autocratic rule on August 5, there were numerous reports of attacks against Hindu households, temples and businesses.\n\nIndia’s BSF said 11 Bangladesh nationals had been arrested since Sunday trying to “sneak” across the frontier into West Bengal state.\n\n“Several hundred Bangladeshi nationals are still waiting in no-man’s land to cross over the border,” BSF deputy inspector general Amit Kumar Tyagi told AFP.\n\nBangladesh is almost entirely encircled by India, with the border stretching for more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles), large parts of which are unfenced.\n\nFour Bangladeshis were also “repelled” from India’s Assam state, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on social media platform X.\n\nNew Delhi has kept a wary eye on the fall of Hasina, who pursued a delicate balancing act of enjoying support from India while maintaining strong relations with China.\n\nHindus account for around 8 percent of Bangladesh’s 170 million people.\n\nOver the past week, religious rights groups said they documented more than 200 incidents of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh, a figure that also includes Christians and Buddhists.\n\nThe security situation has since dramatically improved, and on Monday Bangladeshi police resumed patrols of the capital Dhaka, ending a strike that left a law and order vacuum.\n\nIndia’s home minister Amit Shah said Friday a committee had been created to monitor the situation “to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals, Hindus, and other minority communities living there.”\n\nInterim government leader Muhammad Yunus’s “council of advisers,” the de facto cabinet now administering the country, said it had noted with “grave concern” some attacks on Hindus and other minorities.\n\nIn its first official statement on Sunday night, the cabinet said it would work to “find ways to resolve such heinous attacks.”\n\nLONDON: The UK government welcomed Monday the “de-escalation” of disorder and rioting in English towns and cities following a knife attack that killed three children, but insisted officials remain on “high alert.”\n\n“We welcome that there has been a de-escalation this weekend. But we’re certainly not complacent and remain on high alert,” a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said.\n\nThe violence, blamed on the far right, came after misinformation spread about the alleged perpetrator of a mass stabbing on July 29 at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, northwestern England.\n\nThree girls — Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven — died in the attack. Ten others were injured including eight children.\n\nThe stabbings sparked a riot in Southport the following evening, on July 30, and violence in more than a dozen English towns and cities as well as in Northern Ireland over the ensuing week.\n\nStarmer’s spokeswoman said authorities had acted decisively to quell the unrest but that there was no room for complacency.\n\n“We also recognize that the job is not done until people feel safe in their communities, but thanks to the work of our police officers, prosecutor and judiciary, we have seen a swift response from the justice system,” she said.\n\n“Within a matter of days, we’ve seen criminals involved arrested, charged, sentenced and behind bars,” she added.\n\nOfficials blamed the violence on far-right agitators and opportunist “thugs” accused of using the tragedy to further their anti-immigration, anti-Muslim agenda.\n\nMisinformation spread online in the immediate aftermath of the stabbing spree, claiming that the perpetrator was a Muslim immigrant.\n\nBritish-born Axel Rudakubana has been charged with murder and attempted murder over the attack. His parents hail from Rwanda, which is overwhelmingly Christian.\n\nA motive for the attack has not been disclosed, but police have said it is not being treated as terrorism-related."
