Ian Ferguson is the co-author (with his brother Will) of “Why I Hate Canadians,” and now, “How To Be A Canadian.” He tells Anne Strainchamps that Canadians are passive-aggressive, not polite and that they hate Americans for not knowing or caring about Canada. He also speaks some authentic Canadian, and offers pointers for people trying to pass.
