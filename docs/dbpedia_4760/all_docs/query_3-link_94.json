        "text": "John Kordyback, a treasured colleague and friend, died last week, aged 64.\n\nOnce the bus from Denver airport had pulled into the Colorado ski resort, and I'd deposited my bags in my room, I set out to begin the weekend. It was June, so there was no snow on the slopes, but I wasn't here for the mountains, even though I love to hike in them. My attention instead was to my colleagues, a couple hundred of which were there with me for a North America \"awayday\" - a weekend gathering of employees of Thoughtworks. Walking along I was soon hailed by a welcome face in a flat cap, sitting outside with a glass of beer as work-in-progress.\n\nI'd first met John Kordyback ten years prior to this. I was visiting our new office in Calgary and one of my co-worker friends said “you’re really going to like this new hire” and was quickly proven correct. While the elders in the company were people just into their 30's, John was my age. Happily I discovered that he also shared my sense of humor, and took delight in friendly banter. Of more professional importance, he found much that appealed in our embrace of agile software development.\n\nThe world of agile software was very different in the early 2000s. These were the days when agile ideas about embracing change were considered irresponsible, when nobody thought that real programmers should be testing their own software, and deployment into production only done once or twice a year (not counting bug-fix emergencies).\n\nWhen I sat down with my own glass of beer, agile had grown into desirability, and many clients wanted folks like John to lead their own journey into this style of software development. But John had found a particularly challenging route, applying agile techniques to legacy systems, in particular: Mainframes.\n\nMost of my colleagues were wary of working in legacy systems. They were usually frustrated by poor modularity, few automated tests, and fiddly deployments. But John recognized that these were called legacies because they were valuable to their recipients. Every day we carried out interactions with software that led, sooner or later, to transactions on mainframes. I wanted to hear what he'd found and how he coped with the challenges.\n\nJohn was well suited to this work because he understood the core principles of agile thinking, ones that were often lost in a world of two-day Scrum masters. He was aware that the journey from Mainframes to Continuous Delivery was one of a thousand small steps. (The title of one of his few conference talks.) To carry these out he'd learned the most important thing was to introduce thorough testing, and gradually simplify the path to production.\n\nBut the most important core principle of agile that John understood was that agile habits were founded upon humans working together. When John went into the mainframe world, he listened to those already there. There were lots of folks in mainframe development who were keen to try better ways, but needed someone who, while they understood newer techniques, wouldn't tell them how to do things that wouldn't work, but instead would would combine with their experience to discover how to improve mainframe development\n\nJohn naturally worked this way because above all things, he cared deeply about the people he worked with. When the topic of John has come up, the thing that always dominates our memories is his kindness. His humor was infectious, but not cruel. When he faced opposition, he tried to understand where it came from, understanding that often people do bad things because they have been taught to suffer such behavior the hard way. His goal was much greater than agile, it was to bring decency and happiness to people's working lives. To create an environment that would enable to best of us to thrive and multiply these environments.\n\nI haven't seen John for far too long. During his illness we often talked on zoom. Just as he was with his work problems, he faced the demon of cancer with a positive air, even when the news was grim. He had hoped for an easier battle, one that would allow him to work with me to write down his discoveries while he was temporarily away from his clients. Sadly it didn't turn out that way, and I'll no longer be able to seek him out at a gathering. But the memory of his smile and banter will never go away. That part of him will live in our memories for many years yet.\n\nMartin Fowler : 26 March 2024"
