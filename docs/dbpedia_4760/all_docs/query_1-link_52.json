        "text": "X-Country Roundup\n\nIn a country as diverse as Canada, it’s not surprising each province’s students had their own messages to deliver on the day of action. Most protests were directed at provincial governments. Students picketed legislatures, marched down city streets and tried to draw attention to postsecondary education issues. But some students were more militant. At Lakehead […]\n\nUndergrads now members of national student lobby group CFS\n\nA bitter fight between two national student organizations came to a head last night at the University of Toronto Student Administrative Council (SAC) annual general meeting. The U of T voted to become a trial member of the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) after a raucous night of delays, walkouts and a marching band in […]\n\nTears of a Clooney\n\nFilm nerds, if you are reading this, shut up. I know the original Solaris, made by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972, was a great film. I know remaking exceptional films just to put the dialogue in English is stupid. But even if your hatred of remakes verges on the fanatical, see this movie. Steven Soderbergh’s remake […]\n\nLaw tuition survey method called ‘flawed’\n\nWhen the faculty of law put together a plan to raise tuition to $22,000 per year over the next five years, it promised to do research on the tuition hike’s impact on accessibility, and on what jobs its graduates chose. But when U of T’s new provost, Shirley Neuman, met with law students to explain […]\n\nStadium levy sparks hot debate\n\nBruce Kidd got into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame for running. He might be facing the hardest race of his life next week. Kidd is the dean of the Faculty of Physical Education and Health at the University of Toronto. A former gold-medal winning track star, Kidd is the man behind the Varsity Centre […]\n\nPrez’s need-based aid plan not enough, say student leaders\n\nThe University of Toronto is pressing ahead with its plan to change the way it rewards high-scoring students. But student leaders say changing the way scholarships are handed out is just window-dressing on the real problem—high tuition. “Our position is that we obviously need more money,” said Students’ Administrative Council (SAC) president Alex Kerner. “It […]\n\nPharmacy building to replace greenhouses\n\nThe University of Toronto is gearing up to build a brand-new home for its pharmacy department, at a cost of $70 million and a few historic greenhouses. The proposed site of the new building—on the north-west corner of University and College—is already occupied by a complex of elegant white-framed greenhouses. The greenhouses, built in 1931, […]\n\nOfficers seize 54 guns from student\n\nA small arsenal of guns found by police in the home of a prominent member of the University of Toronto’s gun club has some demanding the closure of the Hart House shooting range, in operation since 1919. Michael Brassard, 47, is a recently graduated mature student at the U of T and was a range […]"
