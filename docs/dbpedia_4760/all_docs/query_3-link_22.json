I knew that Rangers were really keen on me and I wanted to go there.\n\n“Graeme Souness had revolutionised the club and I wanted to be part of his plans. He’d brought in England’s captain and goalkeeper in Terry Butcher and Chris Woods and it really was a game-changer. It was unprecedented and it brought Rangers back to life again.\n\nRangers team celebrate with the Premier League trophy in 1987 Back row (l to r): Jimmy Phillips, Billy Kirkwood, Graham Roberts, Ian Durrant, Davie Cooper, Ally McCoist, Graeme Souness (manager), Walter Smith (asst manager), Peter McCloy (coach), Phil Boersma (trainer) Front row (l to r): Stuart Munro, Dave McPherson, Terry Butcher, Jimmy Nicholl, Chris Woods, George Soutar (kit man), Robert Fleck, Derek Ferguson\n\n“Suddenly Souness started to get the best out of the talented Scottish boys that were already there – Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Derek Ferguson and Davie Cooper – and there was massive momentum building.\n\n“He knew the market in England and, of course, his stature in the game was so high. There’s no doubt that played a big part in getting the likes of Butcher and Woods there.\n\n“It was the same with Ray Wilkins and Trevor Francis – guys he knew well form England and Italy.\n\n“Of course, the fact that English clubs were banned from Europe at the time made a big difference. Rangers were a very attractive proposition for guys in England.\n\n“It was different for me. I was a lifelong fan and I would have signed for Rangers in any circumstances, really. But, of course, it was an even more exciting prospect given what was happening at Ibrox.\n\nFerguson celebrates a win for Rangers\n\n“It was an open secret that Rangers wanted me and I became more and more annoyed when the board at Love Street wouldn’t let me go.\n\n“I don’t think there is any doubt that it affected me. How was I supposed to block it out of my mind? It was impossible.\n\n“In fairness the management team were good with me. Alex Smith and Jimmy Bone treated me very well and tried to keep my spirits up. But my performance levels dipped as the saga dragged on.\n\n“St Mirren were trying to push me to move to an English club as there were a number of teams in the market because they didn’t want to sell to Rangers.\n\n“It actually got the stage where I was so sick and fed up with it all that I agreed to talk to one of them – Manchester United.\n\n“Of course, Alex Ferguson had just taken over at Old Trafford the previous season and he was looking to rebuild what was a massive club.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson wanted to take Ian to Old Trafford\n\n“I was flattered that he was interested. Reluctantly, I got in a car that was going to take me for talks. However, we were not even halfway there when I told the driver to stop and turn around.\n\n“I couldn’t go through with it. My heart was set on Rangers and I was determined that I was going to make it happen.”\n\nFerguson is one of only three players to have all nine medals from the fantastic Championship-winning run – McCoist and Richard Gough are the others – and he added a 10th under Dick Advocaat in 1998/99.\n\nHe’s been in Australia for 15 years, having moved there after two seasons under Jimmy Calderwood at Dunfermline, where he has been a successful player and coach working for Central Coast Mariners, North Queensland Fury, Perth Glory and latterly Northern Fury.\n\nSince 2012, he built up Fury almost from scratch into a strong National Premier League Queensland side but left last year after becoming disillusioned with the direction they were going in.\n\nFerguson is delighted with Murty (Image: SNS Group)\n\nHaving tuned 50 this year and having been in the game since signing for Clyde as a kid, he’s taking a well-earned break and helping his wife Suzanne run their convenience store business in Townsville.\n\nHowever, he remains completely in tune with what’s happening at Ibrox and is backing Graeme Murty. He said: “Things changed at the club where I was working so I felt It was time to get out.\n\n“I’ve been non-stop in football, really for 35 years so I’m really enjoying the break and I’m not sure what my next move is. I still watch the Rangers games though. I’ll always be a supporter.\n\n“I was delighted that Graeme Murty got the job until the end of the season because it was the right thing to do.\n\n“It has stabilised the situation and he’s made good signings and getting decent results too. If he can win the Cup and finish second he will deserve the job on a full-time basis.”"
