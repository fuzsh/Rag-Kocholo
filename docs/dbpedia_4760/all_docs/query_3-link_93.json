        "text": "Ian Ferguson is a senior narcotic, robbery and homicide detective for the Kingstown Police Department.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nAs a result of living and working in Kingstown, he's become a seasoned, hard-nosed detective for the Kingstown Police Department and is currently Kyle's partner.\n\nThroughout the Series[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nIn The End Begins, at the memorial service for Mitch, Ian says how they have been to way too many of these memorial services. He then states that this isn’t the place in which you miss a guy, but rather you gotta do it on your own.\n\nIn The Price, when Mike calls Kyle, he finds that Kyle is at a pizza place that's being cased. Kyle has Ian come through the back door to take out what they think is an addict who's about to rob the place, but when the owner opens fire, they take him down instead.\n\nIn Orion, Kyle and Ian are being grilled about their involvement, with the higher-ups worried about the legality of the shooting. Mike implicitly trusts his brother and immediately steps in to try to get everyone to view this as a drug bust. Though initially some investigators are hesitant as no drugs had yet been found, everyone seems to bow to Mike's idea. Later, while Mike is enjoying a hockey game, the police department grab Carlos Jimenez off the street. Kyle and Ian seem on the outs with the rest of the department, who worry that their involvement will turn this operation into a shooting, too.\n\nIn Every Feather, Mike takes Kyle and Ian to the bar to beat up Milo Sunter's representative, promising to do much worse if anything else happens to Iris.\n\nIn The Devil is Us, Ian and Kyle go inside the bus only to discover 26 bodies suspended from the ceiling. The police abandon the crime scene, retching, and say they'll do their initial investigation at the morgue.\n\nIn The Lie of the Truth, Kyle and Ian arrive at the prison to oversee the transfer of Milo, handing over an abundance of weapons they brought with them, including brass knuckles. When Kyle and Ian arrive to pick up Milo, they are stopped in the same room as the shackled P-Dog and a number of custodial workers who appear to be friends of the inmate. Before the cops have a chance to grab their target and get out of there, the inmates go on the offensive. They beat the cops and guards, tasing them and using pepper spray, while Milo looks on. Kyle and Ian get up from their beatings. Ian pours Red Bull into Kyle's hands, so he can wash the pepper spray out of his eyes, and the two move deeper inside the prison to find a place to hide. Eventually, Kyle and Ian make their way into what appears to be the sewer passages. They find a group of inmates hiding in the same place, afraid of retribution from other inmates now that they have guns to settle old scores.\n\nIn This Piece of My Soul, the police get cell service back online, and Kyle is able to text Mike to let his brother know that he's alive and so that they can track his position. With surveillance technology and information from Kyle and Ian themselves, the police are able to put together a SWAT team with a plan to extricate the men. The SWAT team prepares to head into the sewers beneath the prison to extract Mike and Ian.\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nIn Staring at the Devil, Mike and Ian find a discarded weapon and follow a trail of blood. They soon discover a victim hiding behind the bins, still alive. He won’t elaborate on what has transpired exactly but admits that this massacre was just further retaliation tactics. They see it as an eye for an eye kind of fight.\n\nIn Five at Five, Ian and the gang seem intent on destroying any and all of Mike's bonds. Mike drives to the police station to confront Ian and Stevie in person, unafraid to kick-up a fuss outside their building. He demands that they stop raiding Bunny’s places, they need Bunny on their side after all. Ian defends the Force, stating that they had no choice and were very respectful during the raid. Mike couldn’t care less; he knows the ramifications of this incident. Ian urges Kyle to be patient as the paperwork gathers momentum, yet he needs to keep busy.\n\nIn Kill Box, Ian, Stevie and Kyle meet up with Mike at Don's Diner to talk about Milo and the bonds. Both Stevie and Ian are seen again at a crime scene where they find out that Horace's wife was hanged to a tree with a steel chain, Mike arrives and tells Stevie and Ian that they all have to move the bonds. Mike tells the duo that he's sure Rosanne talked because if she did, Milo will be coming after them. Stevie reassures Mike that Milo's goons will not break into the police department's lockup. Mike doubts it but Ian reassures Mike that it's the safest place to put the bonds in. Again, Mike tells Stevie and Ian that the bonds are going to have to be continuously moved until they can be utilized. He tells them to sign them out, make them go missing. Later that day, Ian is seen with two bags and two beverages, the correctional officer who is taking Ian to Charlie Pickings' cell is asking what's with all the food, Ian tells the correctional officer that he is going to trade burgers for bodies.\n\nIn Left With the Nose, Mike and Ian are at Don's Diner. Robert walks into the diner when Ian is asking for two slices of pie. Robert reveals to Mike and Ian that he received a heart attack letter, Kyle walks into the diner when Robert tells Mike that the District Attorney told him to lawyer up and to get everything in order. Mike suspects someone talked. Mike tells Robert to find the one who has been talking. Later, at night, Ian is at the McLusky home visiting Mariam.\n\nIn Drones, at a bar, the old gang assembles. Mike, Kyle, Ian, and Robert discuss the ensuing riots interrogation, as Robert has to testify. Later, Ian is seen in the AdSeg section of the prison delivering lunch to Charlie. Ian tells him that the dismembered body and all the pertaining body parts were found but the Ohio State Police is going to come up to talk to Charlie, they just want specifics. Ian asks Charlie when was the last time he went to the dentist, Charlie says he doesn't like the dentist. To this, Ian agrees with him. Ian tells him it would be nice to get Charlie out of the AdSeg cell, get a bit of some fresh air. Charlie says he would like that.\n\nIn Santa Jesus, Ian is seen driving his cruiser, on the phone with a correctional officer. The officer tells Ian how Charlie cracked his tooth, Ian tells the officer that he'll swing by over and take Charlie to the dentist, he'll return Charlie by 6 PM. Ian takes it upon himself to solve the problem of the damning allegations against his teammate Robert Sawyer, leading to further criminal chaos. Thus, he uses serial killer Charlie as leverage to silence Ben. He shows Ben a report of Charlie’s horrifying crimes as a threat, adding that Charlie now knows where Ben and his family lives. Ian then says that Robert is a good man, ordering Ben to change his statement to tell the District Attorney that he panicked. After this manipulation, Ben fights back, arguing with Ian on his doorstep. He even calls Charlie a rapist. This angers the serial killer, who attacks Ben, snapping his neck with ease. Ben is dead. They drag his body back into the house, and Ian is forced to stage the place like a crime scene, making it look like a robbery has just occurred. Ian takes Ben’s wallet and orders Charlie to knock the door down. The two then drive off, praying they haven’t been spotted. Later Ian contemplates shooting Charlie but changes his mind in the end. Ian’s plan works, and the investigation is dropped. Robert celebrates the result with Kyle and Stevie. Ian joins them later, mentioning his day’s work, taking a serial killer to the dentist. The next day, Ian has two stryofoam cups filled with coffee, he walks up the stairs into Mike's office, hands a cup of coffee to Kyle and sits down. Rebecca gets there and asks Ian if Mike is there, he says no. Bunny's cousin, Rhonda, enters the office and asks everyone where Mike is. Rebecca tells him that nobody has a clue where. Ian shushes Rebecca for a second and switches off the AC, he goes into Mike's office hearing Mike's phone vibrate inside the desk drawer. Ian opens the desk drawer, gives Mike's phone to Kyle and he answers Mariam's call.\n\nIn Peace in the Valley, at the gun shop, Ian updates Mike on the current situation. A man matching Bunny’s description orchestrated the heist, cleaning out the entire store in minutes. In Ian’s eyes, this is the declaration of all-out war. Ian urges Mike to de-escalate matters immediately and to speak with Bunny in person. Mike then continues his rounds the next day, with mounting pressure from Ian and Stevie.\n\nIn Little Green Ant, Ian, Kyle, Mike and Stevie are at Kingstown General Hospital, looking through Robert's room window. Kyle asks Mike if Robert is going to make it. Stevie asks who would do such a thing, Ian says they have a lot of enemies inside and out. Mike tells the trio that he has to go, Ian asks Mike where is he going. Mike speaks with Ian, someone he can always rely upon. Mike calls Ian and explains that he’s been targeted by the Aryan Brotherhood, he’s killed three of them, but his car is all shot up. It’s a real mess that Mike needs Ian to clean up and make disappear pronto. Ian agrees to help. Later, Mike phones Kyle and Ian for backup, and they all race over. Ian and Mike chat outside the hospital. They need to catch Milo before things escalate even further. Ian agrees to use the full power of the force to track him down. Mike grabs the bonds from his shot-up car down at the train tracks and heads to the meeting point with Ian. Afterwards, Ian kicks into action and shoots Milo’s goons. The trio is at the hospital. Ian tells Mike and Kyle that the doctors are prepping the operating room, Ian tells them that the bullet's near the spine, it didn't puncture the lung or the heart, the doctors don't think. Kyle asks if Mariam is awake, Ian says no. Mike asks Ian how long until she's in the operating room, Ian tells Mike as soon as possible. Mike asks how long is surgery, Ian says an hour, maybe two hours, he says that the doctors have to figure out what to do with the blood. Ian reassures Mike that Mariam is going to pull through. Ian comes out of the hospital after Mike, he tells Mike that he will put out a escaped prisoner alert and Milo will try to make a break for the border. Mike says Milo thinks that Mike still has the bonds, Mike wants to get after Milo. Ian tells Mike he can checkpoint every backroad, every highway, put an eye in the sky, get a marine unit out. Mike tells Ian if he hears anything, he has to let Mike know first. Ian agrees and asks about Kyle and Mike says he doesn't know. Mike tells Ian he doesn't know about anything right now, he continues saying to Ian that they're going to make it as they go and that first thing first is to go after Milo. Ian agrees. Both Ian and Mike drive to the club and they spot Tatiana. Mike asks where Milo is, Tatiana says that Mike destroyed his plans, so he's probably coming up with a new one. Mike asks Tatiana to call Milo, she tells him it's kind of late. Ian, getting impatient, tells Tatiana to call Milo. Mike tries to convince and reason with Tatiana, telling her to call him and that Tatiana will be off off both Mike's radar, the police's and the gang's radar. Mike continues to tell Tatiana if she doesn't do it, Mike will make sure that the cops and the gangs roll through the club on rotation, where she won't be able to stay calm without a raid or a shootout. Tatiana tells Mike that Mike should've just given Milo the money he wanted. Again, Mike tells Tatiana to call him. After the call, Mike tells Tatiana that if he doesn't kill Milo, Milo will be coming after her. Tatiana knows this, Mike tells Tatiana that she should get the baby and get out of Kingstown. Tatiana tells Mike that she has friends and that she can take of herself, Tatiana tells Mike he should do the same. Mike tells Ian to call his friends and to tell them that they're on their way. Much later on the same day, both Ian and Mike race to the train tracks where Mike was ambushed by AB. Mike gets out of the car he's in and opens the trunk of the shot up lincoln and gets out Milo's bonds. Afterwards, they head to where Milo told Mike to go. Both Ian and Mike get where Mike needs to meet with Milo. Ian asks Mike if Milo is just going to take the bonds and let Mike walk away peacefully. Ian tells Mike to let him get some backup and S.W.A.T. Mike tells Ian if Milo feels anything, he'll kill Iris. Ian tells Mike that he does not want to be a complete jerk, but he tells Mike why not let Milo take Iris. Ian doesn't know Iris. Why not let both Milo and Iris flee. Mike replies to Ian saying that it is the right thing to do, that's why. Ian agrees and asks what Mike wants him to do. Mike asks if Ian has any long guns in the trunk of Ian's cruiser. Ian says that he does, he has an arsenal in the trunk. Mike tells Ian to go down the hill and follow Mike through the scope of the sniper rifle. Mike lastly tells Ian if anything goes sour, to start shooting and to not accidently shoot Mike. Mike gets out of the car, goes to the trunk of the car and gets Milo's bonds. Ian follows Mike through the scope. Before Mike is shot by Milo's goon, Ian immediately shoots the goon.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nTBA.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nThe Mayor of Kingstown\n\nThe End Begins\n\nSimply Murder\n\nThe Price\n\nOrion\n\nEvery Feather\n\nAlong Came a Spider\n\nThe Devil is Us\n\nThe Lie of the Truth\n\nThis Piece of My Soul\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nNever Missed a Pigeon\n\nStaring at the Devil\n\nFive at Five\n\nThe Pool\n\nKill Box\n\nLeft with the Nose\n\nDrones\n\nSanta Jesus\n\nPeace in the Valley\n\nLittle Green Ant\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nSoldier's Heart\n\nGuts\n\nBarbarians at the Gate\n\nRag Doll\n\nIris\n\nEcotone\n\nMarya Was Here\n\nCaptain of the Sh*t Out of Luck\n\nHome on the Range\n\nComeuppance\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]"
