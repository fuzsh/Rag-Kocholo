        "text": "Second venue in one location opened last month , on the same street üöÄ Footfall, is one of the most important elements when selecting location of your business. Questions to ask yourself: ‚òëÔ∏è Will you naturally generate customers based on your location? ‚òëÔ∏è What can you do different to stand out from the other bars and restaurants within walking distance from your location? ‚òëÔ∏è How can those bars and restaurants compliment what you offer and your menu? We have partnered with others bars within a stone throw away. Why? Because they offer something we can‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt do kitchens, or food. The overheads are too expensive and within this market it‚Äôs quite risky. We partner with other local business owners close by to provide our customers top quality food while they‚Äôre enjoying the best drinks on the street. This helps us have sell out Bottomless brunches, without having to worry about the food! How do we do this? Join our group in the bio!\n\nLast week I took off in the middle of the week and went to chase balloons. Typically I work Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, but I flexed my time so all got done that needed to get done. This was not something that could be planned. It wouldn't have been able to happen if I didn't have a boss who trusts me with flexibility. His response when Itold him my plan? \"Sounds like fun. Pretty skies.\" (Thanks Stan Park !) These balloons were gas balloons that were part of a distance race called the Gordon Bennett. Usually it is held in Europe and I am admittedly obsessed with it. It had been 16 years since it had been in our country. I was excited to see balloons headed toward me. Well, though two balloons landed in North Carolina and several in Georgia, I wasn't able to catch any of them - but what fun it was to try. I think I traversed the interstate between Georgia and South Carolina about six times at one point, as one I was trying to catch landed and I switched to another that I figured would land soon (and they did, but I was too late to the scene.) The next day I tried again, but had another near miss (I was truly bummed because they are ballooning legends). I knew the only remaining balloon up was a bit too far away for a good shot at seeing it land. These balloons, by the way, launched in Albuquerque and the winning team and first runner-up were in the air for four nights (there are two pilots, so they do sleep). Many of the others flew for three. The winners, from France, flew 1,654 miles. Why am I posting this on Linked In? Obviously not to show off my mediocre tracking abilities. I put in a whole week of work (granted, I only work part time), and had an unforgettable adventure. Though I didn't catch any balloons (darn it), it was nothing but fun. Trying to anticipate the routes and decisions of the pilots is a great brain exercise and I had a lot of almosts in there. Life is short and we should live it well. I'm lucky enough to work within an infrastructure that allows me to follow my bliss. I wish that for everyone. Go for the experiences - and the bosses that encourage them. #flexibility #timeoff #worklifebalance (Screen shot from the YB Races App.)\n\nThe world of work is wild isn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶? This week we welcomed a new Freestyler! (Welcome Stuart Webb) We said (or we‚Äôre in the process of saying goodbye) to a valued Freestyler who is off to pastures new (huge thanks and good luck Andrew Rapley). And we hosted a really bright and keen work experience student (yr 12) who is keen to study Computer Science after school and get in to development (and I‚Äôm delighted to say after a week with us at Freestyle she still wants to pursue this path!). We‚Äôve also recently welcomed back an old Freestyle alumni who is working with us on a contract basis (Jake Hudson-Wood you‚Äôre a legend and it‚Äôs great to have you back for a bit!). People really are our biggest asset and it‚Äôs always a joy and a privilege to be a part of someone‚Äôs career journey, whether that‚Äôs for 1 week, 2 years or 8 years! Employers - remember just how valuable your people are, doing the right and ethical thing by your people will always lead to success in the longer term, even if the right things don‚Äôt always feel easy or comfortable. Offering support, mentoring, development and training are critical‚Ä¶softer perks are nice too‚Ä¶but ultimately treating people as humans with respect at every stage of the journey is the key to them looking back on their time with you favourably and to remaining champions of your business long after they‚Äôve left (I still cheerlead for Beyond the Book wherever I can because they did all of those things!). Employees - remember to start well, work well and leave well. Take accountability for your learning, development and happiness, ask for help and support when you need it, be honest and kind, be open to change and you‚Äôll likely have a better work experience. Life's tough enough at times, so let's work together to make work the best experience we can for everyone üí™ Happy Friday Y‚Äôall ‚úå\n\nüî• Unveiling the Power of People: Why Culture Trumps Remote Work üöÄ At Leegra, we're not just in business; we're in the business of people! As an advocate for remote work, I've witnessed firsthand the incredible cohesion within our team. But let me tell you, a company's culture can't be built remotely. Seeing our people thrive and connect during our year-end function was an eye-opener! üåü CULTURE BEYOND THE NORM üåü Imagine this: I recently stumbled upon a team from a major SA bank at a team-building event. One of them praised the event, but then dropped a bombshell: \"I still hate XXX bank.\" Shocking, right? Your company might throw lavish events or employ various tactics, but without genuine intentions, it's all just an expensive party. That's where the Leegra difference shines through. üåà THE LEEGRA DIFFERENCE üåà Our leadership at Leegra has excelled in nurturing our foundational values of acknowledging people for who they are. In over 20 years, we've fostered a culture that sets us apart. How? - We know every team member by name. - Each person is valued for their individuality while being an integral part of the team. - We empower and trust our people. - Aligning company and individual goals is crucial for a successful relationship. - Toxic environments have no place‚Äîwe believe in thriving, not merely surviving. Ready to elevate your #brand? Our dedicated team is geared up to ignite your brand's fire and reconnect you with your customers. Let's make magic happen together! üî•‚ú® Again, well done to our leadership team and all those involved in making this day a reality. Gordon, Jono"
