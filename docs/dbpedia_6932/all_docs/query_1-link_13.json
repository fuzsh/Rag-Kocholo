        "text": "A home warranty for appliances is a smart purchase since it's only a matter of time before one of your appliances malfunctions or breaks down entirely. Plus, the collateral damage of an appliance breaking can be annoying to severe — like rotten food when your refrigerator breaks or water damage to your home when your washing machine goes awry.\n\nView Plans in Your Area\n\nPlease input a 5 digit Zip Code\n\n1\n\nWhat Is Home Warranty for Appliances?\n\nWhen you think about all the appliances in your home, there are many — and several are quite expensive. You can protect your purchases as much as possible with a home warranty plan from HomeServe.\n\nIs an Appliance Home Warranty Worth it?\n\nHome appliances can cost $500 or more apiece, plus maintenance and repair costs. Whichever way you do the math, that’s a lot of money. When you have a home warranty plan from HomeServe and one of these pricey appliances breaks down, the coverage is worth it.\n\nNot only will you save money in the long run, but your covered appliances will be repaired or replaced, so you can get your life back on track without the hassle of finding a reliable repair technician.\n\nWhat Problems Can Your Appliances Cause?\n\nPart of owning a home is the responsibility of fixing problems with your appliances when they arise. There’s no more calling your landlord to come in and do the job — you’re now in charge of figuring out how to get it fixed as well as how to pay the associated expenses. Issues that arise with your appliances can range from minor to major, such as fire or water damage. Some of the most common problems people have with their appliances include:\n\nClothes dryer not drying properly\n\nFlickering lights\n\nIce machine in the freezer leaking\n\nRefrigerator not cooling\n\nStove range not heating correctly\n\nWasher leaking water when it’s running\n\nHeating unit blowing cold air\n\nAir conditioner not turning on"
