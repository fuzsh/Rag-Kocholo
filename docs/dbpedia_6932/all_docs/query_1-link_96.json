You’ll have to take time out of your day to find a technician, schedule an appointment, and pay for the repairs or replacements. Even worse, the cost to repair appliances can range from a few hundred dollars to over $5,000. Thankfully, home appliance insurance can help cover these expenses and connect you to a repair technician quickly.\n\nHome appliance insurance, also known as a home appliance warranty or home protection plan, provides financial protection in the event of an appliance breakdown. Unlike homeowners insurance, home appliance insurance doesn’t cover damage from unforeseen events like fires, floods, or theft. Instead, it protects from breakdowns caused by normal wear and tear. This insurance also includes access to a network of repair technicians and customer support services, making finding reliable repair people quick and easy.\n\nTo help you find the best home appliance insurance plan, our team researched and vetted 13 of the top home warranty companies. We looked at each company’s policies, evaluated sample contracts, and read more than 5,700 customer reviews. We reinforced this research by testing 11 products and surveying more than 2,000 home warranty customers. We chose the best home appliance insurance companies based on which scored highest in six key categories: coverage, value, trustworthiness, transparency, customer support, and flexibility.\n\nCompare Our Top Home Appliance Insurance Companies\n\nThe following table compares the 13 leading home warranty companies we reviewed. Out of these, we chose the top five providers offering the best home appliance insurance plans.

Our review criteria used six factors homeowners consider most important for home appliance insurance companies: coverage, value, trustworthiness, plan transparency, customer support, and flexibility. While some companies rated higher in our overall review standards, we prioritized companies offering the best appliance-focused plans.\n\nThe following chart compares the prices of our top five recommended providers of home appliance insurance.\n\nCoverage\n\nThis category looks at each company's coverage caps for the following major appliances—these are some of the most commonly found appliances in basic plans and the most important for homeowners:\n\nClothes dryer\n\nClothes washer\n\nOven\n\nRefrigerator\n\nOur rating also assessed companies on their coverage of the following systems:\n\nElectrical\n\nHVAC\n\nPlumbing\n\nWe awarded points based on the number of items companies covered and the coverage caps for those items. The more closely providers aligned with or exceeded industry standards, the more points they earned. The average coverage rate for appliances and systems is $2,000, while add-ons are $500. Companies lost points if their coverage caps were lower than this. We also docked points for having aggregate coverage limits on claim payouts or an excessive waiting period of more than 30 days. Aggregate coverage caps are overall plan limits that restrict the total amount of claims homeowners can receive per plan period. Essentially, if you reach your total cap, you won't be able to receive a payout on any item, even if you haven’t filed a claim for that type of appliance or system.\n\nCompanies earned additional points for offering policies or benefits that help customers, like coverage of preexisting conditions, discounts on maintenance, free tune-ups, filter replacements, Freon replacements, or general plan upgrades.\n\nFirst American Home Warranty’s comprehensive appliance coverage and generous benefits won it the top spot in this category. First American provides a coverage cap of $3,500 for appliances, $1,500 higher than the industry standard, alongside an unlimited system cap. It also boasts numerous quality-of-life benefits, such as preexisting condition coverage. This perk allows homeowners with older systems to get more out of their policy, as it's common for companies to deny coverage for aging appliances.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how each company performed in the coverage category:\n\nCoverage Score\n\nComprehensive coverage allows homeowners to save more on repair and replacement costs. We awarded providers points for offering generous coverage caps, unique coverage options, and no annual cap limits. We deducted points for coverage waiting periods of more than 30 days.\n\nValue\n\nThe more benefits a company offers its customers and the less it costs, the more value it provides. The average home warranty plan costs $43–$72 per month, with service call fees around $$65–$125. Companies with the lowest costs and service call fees earned more points in this category. We awarded additional points to companies that offer annual and monthly payment plans, allowing homeowners to better fit their budgets. We docked points from companies that tack on surcharges, charge harsh fees, or use other non-customer-friendly practices, like depreciation policies that lower the value of payout based on item age.\n\nSome companies charge higher rates to service high-end appliances. If a company had a policy like this, we docked points or excluded them from this article.\n\nUnfortunately, most companies scored relatively low in this category. The top provider on our list was Select Home Warranty. It offers lower-than-average service calls and monthly fees. It also lacks an after-hours rate increase, a high-end appliance rate, and additional surcharge policies.\n\nHere’s how each company scored for its value:\n\nValue Score\n\nTo determine the value of a home warranty, we considered each provider’s average monthly costs, service call fees, and billing options. Points were deducted for charging extra fees for certain services and repairs.\n\nTrustworthiness\n\nWhen researching home warranty companies, you’ll come across many complaints that home warranties are a scam. While there are some bad-acting home warranty companies, there are also many reputable providers. We scrutinize each company critically and objectively, checking for scams, dishonest business practices, and negative trends in customer reviews. A provider must prove it will deliver on its promises to be included in our roundup.\n\nFor this category, we assessed each company’s overall trustworthiness and customer reception. We read over 5,700 customer reviews on various independent review sites like the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and averaged their scores. The higher a company’s score across these sites, the more points it earned. Companies received additional points for showing other signs of trustworthiness, such as providing long-lasting workmanship guarantees (90 days or more), belonging to a trade organization, and having no ongoing lawsuits.\n\nLiberty Home Guard and First American Home Warranty were the highest-rated companies in this category. Liberty Home Guard has an average customer review score of 4 out of 5 stars. It also gives customers a 60-day workmanship guarantee, twice that of the industry standard. First American also has high review scores and belongs to the National Home Service Contract Association (NHSCA), a nonprofit group that sets a strict code of ethics and ethical business practices.\n\nHere’s how each company scored on trustworthiness:\n\nTrustworthiness Score\n\nTrustworthiness ratings were calculated based on average customer review scores, length of workmanship guarantees, and membership in trusted trade organizations. We deducted points for any brands with ongoing lawsuits. These factors help us separate legitimate home warranty providers from scammers.\n\nPlan Transparency\n\nUnderstanding how home warranties work is essential to make informed decisions about your home appliance insurance policy. Knowing the ins and outs of your contract helps you prevent denied claims, identify when damage is properly covered, and avoid surprise fees.\n\nThis category assessed a company based on how easy to understand and clearly defined its plans were. We read each company’s sample contract to analyze its language (terminology, policy clarity, specificity, etc.), inclusions, exclusions, details, and disclosures. Companies with clearly defined, easy-to-understand contracts earned more points. We deducted points if companies used vague terminology or intentionally left information out of their contracts—common culprits for this included hidden fees and service provider policies.\n\nNo company on our list scored higher than 3 out of 5 stars. Unfortunately, scores like this are common since most companies use complex terminology and intentionally vague language in their contracts. This is why it's important to read your service contract carefully and contact customer support if you have any questions. We recommend getting multiple free quotes and reading more than one service contract to find the best policy for the lowest price and compare coverage options for your home.\n\nHere’s the breakdown of each company’s transparency score:\n\nPlan Transparency Score\n\nTransparent home warranty providers offer detailed disclosures on coverage, service call fees, and exclusions on their websites. We also awarded points to companies that provide sample contracts with thorough information on plan policies.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nWhen a major appliance like your fridge, dishwasher, or washing machine breaks down, you’ll want it repaired immediately. This category assessed each company based on its features, policies, and services that help customers in these difficult situations. We awarded providers more points for offering multiple ways to file a claim, including a 24/7 customer support line, dedicated mobile app, and online chat feature. We also evaluated claim processing time and means of communication. The industry standard claim processing time is 24–48 hours, so any company that took longer lost points.\n\nLiberty Home Guard and Cinch Home Warranty were the top-performing companies in this category. Each company provides 24/7 claims lines, email support, and 24–48-hour claim processing times. Both have dedicated apps, a rare feature for home appliance insurance companies. Liberty Home Guard also has an online chat feature that lets you contact a customer service rep to file a claim anytime. This feature is helpful if your appliance breaks down and you’re unsure if your plan covers the damage, as you can quickly chat with a rep and ask about policy specifics.\n\nBelow are the customer support scores for each provider:\n\nCustomer Support Score\n\nWe awarded points to home warranty providers that make it easy for homeowners to get in touch via multiple customer contact methods. Companies also earned points for quick claims response times and widespread state availability.\n\nFlexibility\n\nBecause appliances vary widely from home to home, having a flexible plan means you can choose the coverage you need without overpaying. Basic plans usually cover appliances like washing machines and refrigerators but may not include coverage for systems like pools, sump pumps, and spas. If you have these kinds of appliances, you’ll want to look for a home warranty company with flexible plans and a wide range of add-ons.\n\nFor this category, we rated each company’s plan diversity, service call fee policies, add-ons, and technician selection. Multiple plan options allow you to choose one that matches your home’s needs without paying for appliances you don't have. Add-on coverage fills in the gaps between plans, letting you choose items a la carte at an extra cost. As such, companies with diverse plan options and large add-on catalogs earned the most points.\n\nCompanies with flexible technician and service call fee policies received additional points. Technician policies allow customers to choose which repair people come to their home, a rarity for home warranty providers. Service call fee policies let you select your service call rate; note that choosing a lower fee results in a higher monthly premium.\n\nFirst American Home Warranty and AFC Home Warranty have the most flexible policies on this list. Both have multiple appliance coverage options, robust add-on catalogs, and bonuses like preexisting condition coverage. Preexisting conditions coverage is especially helpful if you own older or damaged appliances because you can protect items that are more likely to break down.\n\nHere’s how each recommended home appliance insurance company scored for flexibility:\n\nFlexibility Score\n\nProviders earned points for flexibility by offering more plans and add-ons. This helps homeowners customize their home warranty plans to meet their needs. We also awarded points to companies that allow customers to choose their own technician, pick a service call fee, and cancel after 30 days.\n\nPricing for the Best Home Appliance Insurance Plans\n\nThe cost of home appliance insurance is $43–$72 per month on average or $516–$861 annually, depending on your provider and coverage. The following table shows how much you can expect to pay for home appliance insurance from each company. We obtained sample quotes from each of the providers using a 2,115-square-foot, single-family home in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nOur Top 5 Home Appliance Insurance Picks\n\nThe best home appliance insurance companies are Liberty Home Guard and First American Home Warranty because of their strong coverage, moderate price, and high customer review scores. These two brands offer the best overall deals for high-end home appliance insurance policies.\n\nWe looked at 13 major home warranty companies that offer home appliance insurance. Our research included reading more than 5,700 customer responses, speaking with industry experts, and surveying 2,000 home warranty customers.\n\nWe focused on companies that offered the most comprehensive home appliance coverage, prioritizing the following items:\n\nGarage door openers\n\nKitchen appliances like cooktops, refrigerators, exhaust fans, and dishwashers\n\nLaundry appliances\n\nWater heaters\n\nWe also disregarded companies that don’t offer appliance-only policies. For example, American Home Shield scored very well in our general review criteria but doesn’t offer an appliance-only home warranty policy, so we didn’t include it.\n\nBest Overall: Liberty Home Guard\n\n4.6\n\nOverall Score\n\nWe use extensive first-party research, secret shopping, and firsthand testing to evaluate companies on key factors.

We also awarded points to companies that allow customers to choose their own technician, pick a service call fee, and cancel after 30 days.\n\n3.5 / 5\n\nOur Review\n\nLiberty Home Guard (LHG) has one of the best home appliance insurance plans on the market, thanks to its robust coverage and wide selection of add-ons. Its basic appliance plan covers the most important items, including clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers, ovens, cooktops, and ceiling fans. It’s reasonably priced at $49–$59 per month with industry-standard payouts—essentially, this is a reliable, moderate-cost option with no major downsides.\n\nLHG’s biggest benefit is its vast add-on selection of 42 items, the largest in the industry. Most companies have only 10–20 add-ons total, whereas LHG has 18 add-ons for appliances alone. It's unlikely that you’ll have an appliance in your home that isn't protected by LHG, which isn't something we can say for most home warranty companies. We think some of its best appliance options add-ons are water softeners, in-fridge ice makers, stand-alone freezers, and trash compactors.\n\nDespite its generous appliance coverage, LHG has limited system coverage in certain areas. For example, its electrical and plumbing coverage has a lower-than-average cap of $500. LHG also has higher service call fees, ranging between $65 and $125. And it has more limited choices for service call fees, whereas most home warranty companies let you choose between multiple price options.\n\nSee Liberty Home Guard Review\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nExcellent customer support\n\nQuick claims process\n\nKnowledgeable technicians\n\nVague depreciation policy\n\nLHG’s customer review scores are some of the strongest in the industry. Its BBB page has 2,600 responses and an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars. On Trustpilot, it has more than 3,200 reviews with a score of 4.7 out of 5 stars. Its BBB rating has been revoked due to a “pattern of complaints” about its claims process, customer service, and sales tactics. However, this happens frequently on the BBB and LHG’s strong customer reviews tell a different story, so we’re unconcerned. The company responded to the BBB and said it’s taking steps to remedy these issues by introducing software to improve the scheduling and claims process. It also said it has hired more customer service reps and increased training.\n\nReviews of LHG’s appliance insurance policies are mixed. Happy customers point to speedy appliance repair, polite representatives, and an easy claim submission process. We reached out to the customer support line ourselves and were connected to a rep in under 30 seconds.\n\nThe most frequent complaints we saw against LHG are low claim payouts and unfair claim denials. Several customers point out that claims on common appliances like dishwashers or refrigerators received lower-than-average payouts or outright denial. For example, a customer’s dishwasher broke down again following a repair. They said LHG only offered $250 for a new appliance—despite repair costs being quoted at more than $400.\n\nClaims payout issues are not uncommon in the home warranty industry. We reviewed LHG’s sample contract and confirmed that its open-ended policies around payouts and age depreciation could lead to lower appliance claim payouts.\n\nBest Appliance Coverage: First American Home Warranty\n\n4.5\n\nOverall Score\n\nWe use extensive first-party research, secret shopping, and firsthand testing to evaluate companies on key factors.

Its base plan has an appliance coverage cap of $3,500, $1,500 more than the industry standard. Its premium plan’s cap raises to $7,000—more than three times the industry standard—making it ideal for high-end appliance coverage. The most basic plan covers 11 appliances, more than most other companies, and includes built-in microwaves, dishwashers, cooktops, and refrigerators.\n\nFirst American is also a good option for homeowners with older appliances thanks to its First American Upgrade. This bonus covers items with preexisting conditions and damage from improper modification or maintenance. Combined with its high coverage caps, First American offers impressive protection for high-end, new appliances and older items alike.\n\nThat being said, First American has some notable coverage gaps. Its basic plan doesn’t cover essential appliances like clothes washers and dryers. Most basic appliance plans include these items. Even worse, these items aren’t included in First American’s add-on catalog, so you’ll need to purchase the premium plan if you want to protect your clothes washer and dryer.\n\nSee First American Home Warranty Review\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nEfficient claims processing\n\nQuick technicians assignments\n\nExcellent support staff\n\nPoor repair results\n\nFirst American has mixed online reviews. It has a score of 1.8 out of 5 stars based on 1,800 reviews on the BBB. It performs much better on Trustpilot, with 4.2 out of 5 stars and 14,600 reviews. After thoroughly reviewing responses from both sites, we believe Trustpilot’s pool of reviews is a more accurate representation of customers’ experiences. We’ve found that customer reviews on the BBB skew more negatively across the home improvement industry than other sites, whereas Trustpilot reviews are more balanced and have a larger pool of responses—10 times that of the BBB.\n\nHappy customers praise First American’s quick, easy claim process. We tried the system firsthand and found it to be simple and intuitive. First American processed our claim and assigned our technician within 30 minutes of filing. Other positive comments compliment the provider’s polite, prompt customer representatives and technicians, with multiple customers reporting a speedy and efficient appliance repair.\n\nThe most common issues regarding First American’s appliance coverage were poor repair quality and low-quality replacements. For example, one customer claimed that after multiple repair attempts on a dishwasher, the company sent a replacement product that didn’t perform as well as the original. Another commenter had a repair technician visit their property several times to repair an ice maker within a refrigerator. After more than one month of return visits, First American had to send a different technician.\n\nBest for Customization: AFC Home Warranty\n\n4.4\n\nOverall Score\n\nWe use extensive first-party research, secret shopping, and firsthand testing to evaluate companies on key factors.

Typically, home warranty providers offer systems, appliances, and premium plans. AFC has an additional plan, referred to as the “Gold” plan, which bridges the gap between the basic and premium plans. This plan combines the coverage of AFC’s system and appliance-focused plans but lacks some of the premium options included in its “Platinum” plan. This is great for homeowners who want both system and appliance insurance but don’t want to commit to the most expensive plan.\n\nAFC offers a modest selection of appliance add-ons, including sump pumps, well pumps, hot water dispensers, and pool and spa systems. Its coverage caps are set at $3,000, $1,000 above the industry standard. It also has several benefits not commonly offered by other companies, such as credit monitoring, identity protection, and pet, dental, and health insurance plans.\n\nUnfortunately, AFC’s basic plans are less impressive. Its appliance-only plan includes basic items like a clothes dryer/washer, refrigerators, and cooktops. Additionally, it has a strict depreciation policy that limits payouts on items five years or older. This makes AFC less appealing if you have older appliances since you’ll pay more out of pocket if they break down. AFC also requires customers to report instances of damage within 24 hours of noticing them, whereas other companies do not have such strict time restrictions.\n\nSee AFC Home Warranty Review\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nComprehensive protection\n\nExcellent benefits\n\nTechnician flexibility\n\nDepreciation policy issues\n\nAFC Home Warranty has far fewer reviews than other companies on this list. Its BBB page has only 134 reviews and a 2.1 out of 5-star rating. On Best Company, it has 3.4 out of 5 stars and more than 110 reviews.\n\nPositive reviews praise AFC’s coverage, polite representatives, and unique member benefits. Reviewers also highlight AFC’s simple claims process and flexible technician policy. One customer on Best Company specifically mentioned the company’s wide coverage of appliances.\n\nWe reviewed every response on the BBB and found less than a dozen that specifically criticized AFC appliance coverage. Those we did discover mentioned low claims payouts or lackluster appliance replacements. One customer felt frustrated after an older appliance received a lower payout due to its age. They also claimed this policy was not openly or clearly explained to them from the beginning. Unfortunately, this may have been the case if they spoke to a representative. When we reviewed AFC’s contract, this depreciation policy was clearly outlined.\n\nBest Value: Select Home Warranty\n\n4\n\nOverall Score\n\nWe use extensive first-party research, secret shopping, and firsthand testing to evaluate companies on key factors.

This plan covers most basic appliances, such as dryers, refrigerators, and cooktops. It has a low monthly price of $44 and a service call fee of $60–$75, making it a good option for homeowners looking for basic protection on a budget.\n\nSelect stands out for its generous bonuses, like its free roof-leak coverage and moderate add-on selection. If you’re looking for good HVAC coverage alongside your appliance insurance, it also has higher-than-average coverage caps of $3,000, making it a strong option for homeowners looking to get the most value for their money.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s a catch to Select’s low prices: its payouts. It only offers $500 coverage caps for almost all items, four times lower than the industry standard. This means Select is ideal for homeowners with lower-end appliances that are less expensive to repair. If you own a $4,000 refrigerator, the most Select will pay to fix it is $500. Essentially, the cheaper your appliances, the more you get out of Select.\n\nSee Select Home Warranty Review\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nAffordable plans\n\nConsiderate sales team\n\nFriendly customer support\n\nMultiple service call fee charges\n\nSelect’s customer review scores are inconsistent across review sites. Its BBB page has more than 2,100 reviews, averaging 1.3 out of 5 stars. On Trustpilot, it has 4,900 reviews averaging 3.5 out of 5 stars. These scores are the lowest of any company in this review.\n\nPositive reviews compliment Select’s low rates, simple claims process, and professional sales reps. One reviewer noted a positive experience with a sales representative, saying the person walked them through their plan options, wasn't pushy, and was highly knowledgeable.\n\nCritical responses note long phone wait times, low payouts, and frequent claim denial. The most common criticism related to appliances was the low return value from policies due to Select’s depreciation policy. Like many other home warranty companies, Select offers payouts based on your items’s current worth, which degrades over time. This leads many homeowners to receive lower-than-expected returns from their plans. Combine this with Select’s already low coverage caps, and it's easy to see why some customers aren’t happy when Select only gives them a few hundred dollars for their expensive appliance repairs.\n\nBest Additional Perks: Cinch Home Services\n\n4.4\n\nOverall Score\n\nWe use extensive first-party research, secret shopping, and firsthand testing to evaluate companies on key factors.

This plan includes standard fare like cooktops, refrigerators, and clothes washers alongside less commonly covered items like freestanding ice makers and trash compactors. This makes Cinch a great option if you're looking for the most coverage possible in your plan.\n\nBesides solid baseline coverage, Cinch provides bonuses like a 180-day workmanship warranty (six times the industry average). Combined with Cinch’s moderate monthly costs, this bonus makes it valuable for homeowners who want good coverage at a reasonable price.\n\nCinch has two major downsides: limited add-ons and high service fees. Unlike most home warranty companies, which provide an average of 10 add-ons, Cinch only offers six. This limits plan customization and means Cinch won't cover some appliances, like water softeners.\n\nSee Cinch Home Services Review\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nReviews for Cinch are polarized. On the BBB, it has a score of 1.1 out of 5 stars based on nearly 1,500 reviews. Its Trustpilot page has more than 3,300 reviews and 3.8 out of 5 stars.\n\nCustomers praise Cinch’s easy-to-read policies, polite and knowledgeable staff, and prompt claim processing. When looking specifically at appliance-related comments, happy customers compliment repair personnel’s skill and professionalism. One customer stated that after working with a previous home warranty company that failed to repair her damaged appliances adequately, the first technician sent by Cinch solved the problem.\n\nThe most common complaints for Cinch highlight long claim processing times and high service call fees. One customer stated that, depending on the appliance, service call fees were more expensive than outright replacing the item. While we find this comment somewhat hard to believe, Cinch has higher-than-average service call fees, between 1.5–2 times the industry average. If you had a lower-end appliance like a cheap microwave, the service call fee could theoretically be more expensive than a replacement.\n\nCombined with Cinch’s decent coverage caps and unique item coverage, these high service fees make it a better fit for homeowners with high-end appliances or uncommon coverage needs. Unlike companies such as Select, which work best for inexpensive appliances, Cinch is the opposite: It provides better guarantees, wider coverage, and industry-standard caps for a slightly higher price.\n\nFAQ About Home Appliance Insurance"
