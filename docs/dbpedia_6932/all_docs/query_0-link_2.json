Check out our Electronic & Other Electrical Equipment Industrial Database, featuring detailed profiles of 13,500+ U.S. electronics companies and their 38,200+ executives.\n\n3 MIN. READ\n\nHomes and businesses cannot function without modern appliances. The U.S. appliance manufacturing sector includes refrigerators and freezers, washers and dryers, cooking appliances, and heating and cooling appliances.\n\nWhile the increase in the sector's jobs over the last year was modest at 0.99 %, you can expect emerging intelligent technologies and increased consumer purchasing power to drive further growth.\n\nThe Latest Statistics in the Household Appliances Manufacturing Sector\n\nWhile statistics such as women and minority ownership, at 2% and 1%, respectively, mirror those of total manufacturing, the appliance manufacturing sector departs in several significant areas. According to MNI, publisher and compiler of the industrial data that powers IndustrySelect, the sector imports 24% of its raw materials versus 11% for manufacturing in general. While you might view this as a disadvantage, international distribution at 52% versus 29% for total manufacturing goes a long way to compensate.\n\nDomestic distribution of appliances is only 25%, while for manufacturing as a whole, it stands at 70%. Appliance manufacturers have 13% public ownership, while total manufacturing has only 5%.\n\nMost of the 383 appliance manufacturers in the U.S. (89 or 23%) are in the Midwest. The second largest cluster (57 or 15%) locate their facilities in the South. The West houses 37 or 10% and the Northeast 25 or 7%.\n\nRelated: Key Facts & Trends in the U.S. Electronics Manufacturing Sector\n\nTop 10 Household Appliance Manufacturers in the U.S.A.\n\nCompanyCityState Number of EmployeesHaier US Appliance Solutions, Inc.LouisvilleKY6,000Whirlpool Corp., Clyde Opers.ClydeOH3,500Electrolux Major AppliancesSpringfieldTN2,800Whirlpool Corp.MarionOH2,500Whirlpool CorporationFindlayOH2,300Roper Corp.La FayetteGA2,000Philips Oral Healthcare, LLCBothellWA1,800A.
