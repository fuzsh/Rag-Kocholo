        "text": "We offer the same services to both U.S. and non-U.S. firms operating overseas or processing in foreign countries. The range of international services includes:\n\nTraining on the principles of auditing, hazardous analysis and critical control point (food safety), or sensory analysis.\n\nOn-site implementation and verification of HACCP-based process controls.\n\nThird-party verification activities for foreign processors.\n\nCertification agencies\n\nOnline certification through the Seafood Inspection Services Portal\n\nSISP Tutorial for Contract Customers\n\nSISP Tutorial for Non-Contract Customers\n\nExport Certification\n\nWe offer export certification services to facilitate exports of seafood products that meet the unique requirements of each importing country and any other specific industry buyer criteria.\n\nWe represent the United States in negotiations with other countries regarding their import requirements for seafood products from the United States. These negotiations frequently include the development and modification of certificates to accompany U.S. seafood exports. We are the Competent Authority to issue and sign these certificates in the United States.\n\nIf foreign border inspection posts raise questions about a certificate issued by the NOAA Seafood Inspection Program, NOAA will attest to the legitimacy of the certificate and make an effort to answer any questions. NOAA may act as a go-between for communication between the exporting industry and importing authority to quickly address issues that arise when a product is detained from entry.\n\nDetentions related to export certificates may arise from simple language translation, varying interpretations of regulations in the importing country, or issues not related to seafood safety.\n\nNOTE: Export certificates must be requested and issued prior to shipment of product.\n\nExport Certification to the European Union\n\nWe certify U.S. seafood products for export to the European Union.\n\nInstructions and requirements are available for both export health certification and IUU catch documentation required for export to EU member countries.\n\nNote: If products are first being exported to a non-EU country, but will subsequently be exported to the EU, they must be accompanied by an IUU catch document.\n\nLearn more about export certification to the European Union\n\nExport Certification to non-EU countries\n\nThe NOAA Seafood Inspection Program certifies U.S. seafood products for export to any country requiring health certification.\n\nGet country-specific instructions and requirements for export to non-EU countries:\n\nA–F\n\nG–M\n\nN–Z\n\nCertification for Exported Product Intended for Further Processing and Re-export to the EU\n\nThe Certificate of Inspection - Fishery Product Intended for Re-Export to EU is provided upon request for products that are exported from the U.S. with the intent of reprocessing and re-export to EU. The processor of the product must be listed as a current approved shipper to the E.U. While this certificate confirms the product meets the stated attestation, it is not a Health Certificate. This certificate may be requested in conjunction with a Health Certificate or as a standalone document for all destinations except EU and EFTA.\n\nProduct Registration\n\nProduct Registration is an advanced component of the SISP online system that allows eligible industry members who choose to use it to register/certify product prior to leaving the United States without providing specifics of consignee. Product eligible for this program is defined as U.S. wild caught product that originated from a USDC Approved Establishment produced under an approved Quality Management Plan.\n\nEffective April 1, 2024, registered product will become ineligible for certification 180 days after registration. Any product registered prior to April 1, 2024, will become ineligible for certification on September 28, 2024.\n\nTo view the component and its features select one of the following:\n\nProduct Registration Customers\n\nExport Certification for Aquatic Animal By-Products\n\nRequests for export certification of aquatic animal by-products not intended for human consumption are submitted via email in PDF format. The request form must be completed and submitted prior to shipment. Certificates are issued after verification that all U.S. requirements are met along with any specific requirements of the importing country. Email requests to: nmfs.nsil.fm.export@noaa.gov.\n\nAccess and fill out the By-Product Export Certificate Request Form (PDF, 2 pages)\n\nCertification Validation\n\nWe maintain a database of verified completed seafood inspection certificates. To use the system, you will need to know the certificate number, certificate number extension, certificate date, and species.\n\nExport Requirements\n\nFish and Fishery Products for Human Consumption and Fish Meal\n\nThe foreign country export requirements provided below are based on information from prior exports, official notifications, and available online websites from each country's competent authority. The information is meant as guidance only, and all exporters should confirm product documentation requirements with the importer and the competent foreign authorities before production for export to a foreign market. We assume no liability for the accuracy of this information.\n\nInformation provided in each country's webpage relates to certification requirements for fish and fishery products destined for human consumption. Certificates for these countries might include food safety/public health attestations, animal health attestations, or both. Email inquiries to NMFS.Seafood.Services@noaa.gov.\n\nFish Oil Dietary Supplements Label Approval Procedures\n\nNOAA Seafood Inspection Program is the competent authority for certification of fish oil. SIP offers export certification for dietary supplements characterized as fish oil, including those with other oil ingredients. To ensure consistency on this process, SIP offers export certification for products using the approval process outlined in the Memorandum:\n\nMemorandum: Certifications for Fish Oil Dietary Supplements Update and Label Approval Procedures (PDF, 2 pages)\n\nLabels must be pre-approved prior to certification. To gain label approval please send an electronic copy of the label and the formulation of the product to sip.fishoil@noaa.gov\n\nForeign Approved Lists\n\nVarious foreign destinations for U.S. fishery product export have listing requirements. Exporters should carefully review their current listing status prior to arranging shipments. This section provides links to current approval lists for specific destination countries.\n\nThe listed trade partners have various listing requirements for export from the United States involving shippers and/or processors. These lists are maintained by either U.S. Department of Commerce or Food and Drug Administration in partnership with the foreign government.\n\nGo to foreign approved list\n\nTrade Monitoring\n\nNOAA Fisheries plays a critical role in streamlining seafood trade in and out of the United States. Working in conjunction with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, we provide support to seafood dealers to ensure imported seafood, such as Patagonian toothfish, bluefin tuna, swordfish, and bigeye tuna, is caught and imported legally.\n\nAntarctic Marine Living Resources Program Permits\n\nSeafood Import Monitoring Program\n\nTuna Tracking and Verification Program and Dolphin-Safe\n\nAtlantic Highly Migratory Species International Trade Program\n\nForeign Seafood Trade Data\n\nWe maintain a foreign trade database dating back to 1975 that allows users to summarize U.S. foreign trade (imports/exports) in fish products. You can can summarize the weight and dollar value by year, product, country, and type of trade."
