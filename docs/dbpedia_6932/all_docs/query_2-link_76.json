License and Ownership.\n\n2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the applicable Order Form, Docker hereby grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license during the applicable Subscription Term for Customer to permit its Users to: (i) download, install, run, and use Docker Desktop and (ii) access and use Docker Hub, and otherwise access and use the Docker Platform, in accordance with the applicable Documentation for Customer’s internal business purposes. Docker owns the Usage Data. Nothing herein will be construed as restricting or prohibiting Docker from utilizing the Usage Data in any way, including to optimize and improve the Docker Platform or related Docker services so long as the Usage Data remains aggregated and de-identified, or to enforce this Agreement.\n\n2.2 The Docker Platform is made available for use or licensed, not sold. Customer acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not transfer to Customer any Docker or third-party intellectual property rights. Customer acknowledges and agrees that, as between Docker and Customer, Docker owns all right, title, and interest in and to the Docker Platform (including any improvements, modifications, and enhancements thereto), and Docker shall, notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, remain the owner of the Docker Platform. All rights not expressly granted by Docker herein are reserved.\n\n2.3 During the Subscription Term, Docker will provide support for the Docker Platform in accordance with the Service Level Agreement & Terms available at https://www.docker.com/support/, as applicable to the products and support purchased via an Order Form.\n\n3. Subscription Term; Payment.\n\n3.1 The length of the Subscription Term. The Subscription Term will automatically renew for additional 12-month periods unless a party provides at least 30 days’ written notice prior to the end of the then-current term that such party does not wish to renew for the upcoming term. In the case of non-renewal by Customer, a notice as found at https://www.docker.com/static/Docker-Notice-of-Non-Renewal.pdf, must be signed and emailed to [email protected] no less than 30 days prior to the end of the Subscription Term. Upon renewal, Customer shall pay the subscription Fees set forth in the applicable renewal Order Form. All payment inquiries should be directed to [email protected].\n\n3.2 For an Offering purchased or otherwise facilitated through our sales team, pricing and other relevant terms will be set forth in the applicable Order Form. Unless stated specifically otherwise on the Order Form, all payments to Docker are due within 30 days of the invoice from Docker to you. Late payments will bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). In addition to any of Docker’s other rights or remedies, Docker reserves the right to disable or suspend Customer’s and its User’s access to the Docker Platform for any failure by Customer to pay due invoices in accordance herein. All payment inquiries should be directed to [email protected].\n\n3.3. For Customer’s purchase of the Services is through a Marketplace or through a Reseller, Customer agrees to pay all fees according to the standard Docker price list found at each Marketplace or Reseller price, including all applicable charges specified for the Service (including any charges for use in excess of authorizations). The Docker price list is exclusive of any customs or other duty, tax, and similar levies imposed by any authority. Customer understands it will pay the applicable Marketplace or Reseller in lieu of paying Docker directly. Customer’s acceptance of the Marketplace or Reseller pricing and terms and conditions shall bind Customer to the obligations of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form. If Customer purchases through a Marketplace or Reseller, Customer will be responsible for full payment of the fees for the Subscription Term, regardless of usage, payment or billing terms between Customer and the Marketplace or Reseller.\n\n3.4 Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, all payments by Customer hereunder are non-refundable and shall be made free and clear of and without reduction for all applicable withholding, sales or use, goods and services, value-added, consumption or other similar fees or taxes imposed by any government (other than taxes on the net income of Docker), which shall be paid by Customer. Accordingly, if you are required to withhold any taxes on the amounts payable to Docker hereunder, you shall pay Docker such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt by Docker of the full amount that Docker would have received but for the deduction on account of such withholding. You shall provide Docker with official receipts issued by the appropriate governmental agency, or such other evidence as is reasonably requested by Docker to establish that such taxes have been paid. Where applicable law requires you to self-assess or reverse-charge any taxes, you shall be responsible for complying with such law. In such a case, you undertake to provide Docker with your valid VAT registration number that is relevant to the Service provided under the terms of this Agreement. The amounts of any taxes required to be paid by Docker will be added to Docker’s invoice, and you shall promptly remit such amounts to Docker, as the collection agent, upon invoice. Docker reserves the right to disable your access to the Service for any failure to pay or any late payment.\n\n4. License Limitations; Use Restrictions.\n\n4.1 General License Limitations.\n\n(a) Customer’s license to use the Docker Platform may subject to certain general restrictions and limitations depending on the Offering Customer has chosen, including but not limited to quantity of data stored, age of data stored, pull rate (defined as the number of requests per hour to download data from Docker Hub), the number of image autobuilds or the number of collaborators on an account, as set forth on the applicable Order Form or Documentation.\n\n(b) Customer agrees that it is responsible for Customer’s and its Users’ conduct while accessing or using the Docker Platform and for any consequences thereof. Customer agrees to use the Docker Platform only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with this Agreement, the Order Form, and any applicable laws or regulations. Customer and its Users shall not, and shall not encourage any third party to: (i) modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works of the Docker Platform; (ii) reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code for the Docker Platform, in whole or in part, except to the extent that such activities are permitted under applicable law; (iii) distribute, license, sublicense, lease, rent, loan, or otherwise transfer the Docker Platform to any third party other than to Users; (iv) remove, alter, or obscure in any way the proprietary rights notices (including copyright, patent, and trademark notices and symbols) of Docker or its licensors or suppliers contained on or within any copies of the Docker Platform; (v) use the Docker Platform for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Docker Platform; (vi) remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Docker or its licensors or suppliers in the Docker Platform; or (vii) use the Docker Platform other than as described in the applicable Documentation or for any unlawful purpose. Customer acknowledges that while Customer is permitted to use Docker Desktop on a virtual machine, as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, such use is an unsupported configuration.\n\n(c) The Docker Platform may include an image vulnerability scanning feature that will scan the images that Customer specifies, which may be based upon code Customer authored or code of others, and may generate vulnerability reports or other information for Customer. The data that supports this feature may be provided by a third party and Customer agrees and understands that any reports or other information that Customer receives from Docker (directly or indirectly) about possible vulnerabilities are not guaranteed to be comprehensive, and there can be no assurance that every fault or vulnerability is discovered in a particular image. Customer agrees that the Docker Platform should not be used as the basis to deploy systems that must be hardened or highly secure, or involve mission-critical business operations, the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, important communication systems, medical devices, air traffic control devices, real time control systems or other situations in which an inaccuracy or error in a report or in the service could lead to death, personal injury, or physical property or environmental damage.\n\n4.2 Specific License Limitations – Docker Desktop.\n\n(a) The Docker Desktop component of the Service at the level of the Personal Offering (as described on the Pricing Page) is further restricted to: (i) your “Personal Use”, (ii) your “Educational Use”, (iii) your use for a non-commercial open source project, and (iv) your use in a “Small Business Environment”.\n\n(b) For purposes of this Section 4.2: (i) “Personal Use” is the use by an individual developer for personal use to develop free or paid applications, (ii) “Educational Use” is the use by members of an educational organization in a classroom learning environment for academic or research purposes or contribution to an open source project and (iii) a “Small Business Environment” is a commercial undertaking with fewer than 250 employees and less than US $10,000,000 (or equivalent local currency) in annual revenue; and (iv) with the exception of Educational Use, Government Entities are prohibited from using the Docker Desktop component of the Service at the level of the Personal Offering. “Government Entities” means (1) any federal, national, supranational, state, provincial, Commonwealth, local or foreign or similar government, governmental subdivision, regulatory or administrative body or other governmental or quasi-governmental agency, tribunal, commission, court, judicial or arbitral body or other entity with competent jurisdiction; (2) any entity directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the government or a government organization; (3) any entity created by law or decree; (4) any entity whose principal source of funds comes from the government; or (5) any department, agency, or instrumentality of a public international organization. It is within Docker’s sole discretion to determine if an entity is considered a Government Entity under the terms of this definition.\n\n4.3 Use Restrictions. Customer and its Users may not and may not allow any third party to:\n\nSend, upload, distribute, or disseminate or offer to do the same with respect to any defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, obscene or otherwise objectionable content;\n\nDistribute malware, viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or any other items of a destructive or deceptive nature;\n\nImpersonate another person (via the use of an email address or otherwise) or otherwise misrepresent yourself or the source of any content;\n\nUpload, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service any content that infringes any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right of any third party;\n\nUpload, post, transmit or otherwise make available through images any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), trade secrets or sensitive or confidential information in violation of contractual, professional or other similar obligations.\n\nDownload any content posted by another user that you know, or reasonably should know, that cannot be legally distributed in such a manner;\n\nSubmit content that falsely expresses or implies that such content is sponsored or endorsed by Docker;\n\nInterfere with other users’ enjoyment of the Service;\n\nAccess the Docker Platform for the purpose of developing or operating products or services intended to be offered to third parties in competition with the Services or exploit the Service for any unauthorized commercial purpose, including without limitation mirroring or replicating content for a commercial service;\n\nModify, adapt, translate, or reverse engineer any portion of the Service, unless authorized by Docker;\n\nRemove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the Docker Platform or any content posted thereon;\n\nReformat or frame any portion of the web pages that are part of the Docker Platform’s administration display;\n\nUse the Docker Platform in connection with illegal peer-to-peer file sharing;\n\nDisplay any content on the Docker Platform that contains any hate related or violent content or contains any other material, products, or services that violate or encourage conduct that would violate applicable laws;\n\nUse any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application, or other device to retrieve or index any portion of the Docker Platform or the content posted thereon or to collect information about its users for any unauthorized purpose;\n\nCreate user accounts under fraudulent pretenses;\n\nUse a service account or a Docker account created under a personal or other email domain not authorized by the Customer pursuant to this Agreement and an applicable Order Form;\n\nUse the Docker Platform, or any interfaces provided with the Docker Platform, to access any Docker product or service in a manner that violates this Agreement;\n\nMine cryptocurrency using computing resources of the Docker Platform or any other Docker computing resources; or load cryptocurrency mining code, scripts or malware into any Docker Platform or any other Docker computing resources.\n\n4.4 Usernames.\n\n(a) Docker reserves the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or individuals that hold legal claims or trademarks to those usernames. Users of business names and/or logos that may be considered misleading to others may be permanently suspended. Docker also reserves the right to reclaim usernames using Docker trademarks or usernames that violate our trademark guidelines, available at https://www.docker.com/legal/trademark-guidelines/, which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.\n\n(b) Customer and its Users shall not engage in username squatting. Users with an account that is inactive for more than 6 months may be terminated at Docker’s discretion and without further notice. Docker takes into account several factors when determining what conduct is considered to be username squatting including, without limitation: (i) the number of accounts created; (ii) creating accounts for the purpose of preventing others from using those account names; and (iii) creating accounts for the purpose of selling those accounts. Customer and its Users shall not buy or sell usernames.\n\n5. Customer Data.\n\nDocker acknowledges that, as between Docker and Customer, Customer owns all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Customer Data. Customer hereby grants to Docker a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, and otherwise use and display the Customer Data solely as may be necessary for Docker to provide the Docker Platform including updates and upgrades thereto. Customer shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and completeness of all Customer Data. In the event Customer Data includes any personal information, Docker will process such information in accordance with its Data Processing Agreement.\n\n6. AI Features.\n\nCustomer’s use of AI Features where available, will be solely at Customer’s discretion. The Service may be used without enabling the AI Features except as otherwise specified in the Documentation. Docker will not use Customer’s Data to train artificial intelligence models without the Customer’s express consent at the Administrator-level of authority.\n\n7. Open Source Software.\n\nAny part of the Docker Platform that contains or utilizes Open Source Software is distributed and made available under the terms of the open source license agreements referenced in the applicable distribution or the applicable help, notices, about or source files or Documentation. Copyrights and other proprietary rights to the Open Source Software are held by the copyright holders identified in the applicable distribution or the applicable help, notices, about or source files or Documentation. The Docker Platform shall not include any code licensed under any “viral” or “copyleft” license.\n\n8. Records and Audit.\n\nCustomer shall establish and maintain complete and accurate records related to Customer and its Users use of the Docker Platform, and any such other information as reasonably necessary for Docker to verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form. Upon at least ten (10) days’ prior notice to Customer, Docker or its representative may inspect such records to confirm Customer’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form. If Customer’s records or Docker’s Docker Platform records reveal that Customer or Customer’s Users have exceeded their permitted use of the Docker Platform, Docker may invoice Customer for any past or ongoing underpaid amounts resulting from such excess use and Customer will promptly pay Docker such amounts upon receipt of invoice. This remedy is without prejudice to any other remedies available to Docker at law or equity or under this Agreement. To the extent Docker is obligated to do so, Docker may share audit results with certain of its third-party licensors or assign the audit rights specified herein to such licensors.\n\n9. Term and Termination.\n\nThis Agreement commences on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until it is terminated in accordance with the terms herein. Either party may terminate this Agreement and any Order Form if the other party materially breaches the terms and conditions of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of receiving written notice thereof. If there are no outstanding Order Forms, either party may terminate this Agreement upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement or an applicable Order Form, the license to the Docker Platform will automatically terminate and Customer will discontinue all use of the Docker Platform. Sections 4.4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 15 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or any Order Form.\n\n10. Feedback.\n\nUpon submitting any Customer or User suggestions, proposals, ideas, recommendations, bug reports, ideas, improvements or other feedback regarding Docker’s products and services (“Feedback”), Customer grants to Docker a royalty-free, fully paid, sub-licensable, transferable, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right and license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise exploit feedback (including by incorporation of such feedback into the Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, the Docker Platform, and any other Docker services) without restriction. Feedback expressly excludes any Customer Confidential Information and Customer Data.\n\n11. Confidentiality.\n\n11.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other (“Recipient”), directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, which is designated as “Confidential,” “Proprietary” or some similar designation, or learned by Recipient under circumstances in which such information would reasonably be understood to be confidential.\n\n11.2 Exceptions. The confidentiality obligations in this Section 11 shall not apply with respect to any information which Recipient can demonstrate: (a) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to Recipient or has become in the public domain through no act or omission of Recipient; (b) was known to Recipient, without restriction, at the time of disclosure as shown by the files of Recipient in existence at the time of disclosure; (c) was disclosed by Recipient with the prior written approval of Discloser; (d) was independently developed by Recipient without any use of Discloser’s Confidential Information; or (e) became known to Recipient, without restriction, from a source other than Discloser without breach of this Agreement by Recipient and otherwise not knowingly in violation of Discloser’s rights.\n\n11.3 Restrictions on Use and Disclosure. Recipient agrees not to use Discloser’s Confidential Information or disclose, distribute, or disseminate Discloser’s Confidential Information except in furtherance of the performance of its obligations or enforcement of its rights hereunder or as otherwise expressly agreed by Discloser in writing. Recipient agrees to restrict access to such Confidential Information to those employees, agents, contractors, or consultants of Recipient who need to know such Confidential Information for performing as contemplated hereunder and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those contained in this Agreement. Recipient shall exercise the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser’s Confidential Information to others as it takes to preserve and safeguard its own information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care.\n\n11.4 Compelled Disclosure. If Recipient is compelled by a court or other competent authority or applicable law to disclose Confidential Information of Discloser, it shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, give Discloser prompt written notice and shall provide Discloser with reasonable cooperation at Discloser’s expense so that Discloser may take steps to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order. Recipient shall not be in breach of its obligations in this Section 11 if it makes any legally compelled disclosure provided that Recipient meets the foregoing notice and cooperation requirements.\n\n11.5 Injunctive Relief. Recipient acknowledges that breach of the confidentiality obligations may cause irreparable harm to Discloser, the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, Recipient agrees that Discloser may be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief in the event of breach of an obligation of confidentiality by Recipient, and that Discloser shall not be required to post a bond or show irreparable harm in order to obtain such injunctive relief.\n\n11.6 Return of Confidential Information. As between the parties, Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Discloser. At any time, upon Discloser’s reasonable request, Recipient shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days) return to Discloser or destroy, at the election of the Discloser, any Confidential Information of the Discloser in Recipient’s possession. In addition, within 30 days after termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall (i) promptly return all tangible materials containing such Confidential Information to Discloser, (ii) remove all Confidential Information (and any copies thereof) from any computer systems of the Recipient and confirm in writing that all materials containing Confidential Information have been destroyed or returned to Discloser, as applicable, by Recipient. Recipient shall cause its affiliates, agents, contractors, and employees to comply with the foregoing.\n\n12. Security\n\nDocker will maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security measures consistent with applicable law and current prevailing security practices and that are intended to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure of Customer’s Data or the Docker Platform.

Subject to the limitation on liability set forth in Section 15, Docker shall defend at its own expense any legal action brought against you to the extent that it is based on a claim or allegation that the Service (excluding any Open Source Software) infringes a U.S. patent or copyright of a third party, and Docker will pay any costs and damages awarded against you in any such action, or agreed to under a settlement signed by Docker, that are attributable to any such claim but shall not be responsible for any compromise made or expense incurred without Docker’s consent. Such defense and payments are subject to the conditions that you (a) give Docker prompt written notice of such claim, (b) tender to Docker sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, and (c) reasonably cooperate with Docker when requested in connection with the defense and settlement of the claim. Docker will have no liability to so defend and pay for any infringement claim to the extent it (i) is based on modification of the Service other than by Docker, with or without authorization; (ii) results from your failure to use an updated version of the Service; or (iii) is based on the combination or use of the Service with any software (including, without limitation, Open Source Software), program or device not provided by Docker if such infringement would not have arisen but for such use or combination; or (iv) results from use of the Service by you after the license was terminated.\n\n14.2 Limitation on Infringement Claims. Docker will have no liability to Customer Indemnitees or any obligations under this Section 14 to the extent a claim arise out of: (a) the modification of any portion of the Docker Platform by any party other than Docker or its authorized representatives; (b) the combination, operation, or use of any Docker Platform with other product(s), data, third party software, or services where the Docker Platform would not by itself be infringing; (c) the continued use of the allegedly infringing Docker Platform after being notified of the infringement claim or after being provided a modified version of the Docker Platform by Docker to address any alleged infringement; or (d) the failure to use the Docker Platform in accordance with the applicable Documentation or outside the scope of the rights granted under this Agreement. Should the Docker Platform, or the operation thereof, become or in Docker’s opinion be likely to become, the subject of such claim described in Section 14.1, Docker may, at its option and expense, (i) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Docker Platform, or (ii) replace or modify the Docker Platform so that it becomes non-infringing. If neither (i) or (ii) are reasonably practicable, Docker may terminate the applicable Order Form and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused Fees paid by Customer corresponding to the unused period of the Subscription Term. THIS SECTION 14 STATES DOCKER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY, AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.\n\n14.3 By Customer. Customer shall defend and hold Docker and its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, and employees (“Docker Indemnitees”) harmless against any third party claims and actions arising from (a) an allegation that Customer Data infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party, and (b) any use by Customer or its Users of the Docker Platform in violation of the license restrictions or violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Docker Platform, and shall indemnify the Docker Indemnitees against any damages, judgments, litigation costs including any reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\n14.4 Procedure. The party seeking indemnification will notify the indemnifying party promptly of any claim or action covered by this Section 14. The parties agree to reasonably cooperate during such proceedings. The indemnifying party will have the right to defend any such claim and will have control over the litigation, negotiation, and settlement of any such claim, provided it will not make any settlement of a claim that results in any liability or imposes any obligation on the indemnified party without the prior written consent of such party, which will not be unreasonably withheld. The indemnified party may, at its sole expense, participate in the defense of any claim.\n\n15. Limitation of Liability.\n\n15.1 Exclusion of Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT DOCKER, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS) ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF CUSTOMER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.\n\n15.2 Liability Cap. THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF DOCKER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY CUSTOMER FOR THE RELEVANT SERVICE UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER FORM IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.\n\n16.
