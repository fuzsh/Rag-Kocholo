        "text": "What is NASTeC? The U.S. has a critical shortage of technicians who can service major home appliances. Manufacturers, retailers, and service businesses are DESPERATELY seeking skilled technicians.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, over 52,000 new technicians could be needed in the next 5 years to service America’s major home appliances. That’s a lot of new jobs!\n\nNASTeC is a voluntary national certification program for technicians who service major home appliances. The NASTeC exams measure the knowledge, ability and skills that technicians need daily to “do the job right.”\n\nNASTeC exams measure the knowledge, ability and skills technicians need daily to do a professional job.\n\nDiscover the tremendous career opportunities available … and why the NASTeC certification process is your path to those opportunities.\n\nISCET, the NASTeC Testing Agency\n\nThe International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians (ISCET) is an internationally-recognized, professional testing agency that provides administration, scoring and analysis of NASTeC exams. It is also a nonprofit society established to develop and administer true certification exams for electronics technicians in all forms. Exams are arranged by ISCET through its national network of Certification Administrators covering most metropolitan and many rural areas. Numerous applications of electronics are covered including the appliance repair and service community. ISCET also provides processing of exam applications and reporting of scores to candidates who take an exam.\n\nThrough their wide choice of examinations covering such things as consumer electronics, industrial electronics, audio, video, biomedical, etc. they offer recognized certifications. Coupled with the educational and learning material published and sold by ISCET on the various electronic elements, including FCC examinations, ISCET offers to the electronics community educational opportunities utilized by many schools and colleges.\n\nThe NASTeC certifications serve a critical need in today’s service industry. They are easily taken through the ISCET Online Testing System, which allows registration for examinations most anywhere in the world through the large system of Certification Administrators (CA). Take the exam(s) in the presence of the CA or proctor appointed to oversee your examination(s), or using ISCET’s Online Testing System (OLT) which allows registration and scheduling for tests over the internet.\n\nNASTeC Certification Helps You Meet Your Goals\n\nWhether you are a technician or a business owner or both, you sell knowledge and performance.

If there is no established Certification Administrator in a particular geographic area, ISCET will make every effort either to obtain an administrator or make arrangements for a test proctor. Tests can be administered in either paper and pencil or using ISCET’s Online Testing System, which allows registration and scheduling for tests over the Internet. All test sessions are in the presence of an ISCET Certification Administrator or Proctor.\n\nMore than 6,500 appliance technicians from across the U.S. were surveyed to define and rate the many skills required. An appliance industry task force of technical specialists used this data to write exam questions. The group included representatives from 6 manufacturers, 1 national retailer, 14 independent businesses and 7 vocational schools.\n\nThere are four levels of NASTeC Certification:\n\nRefrigeration and Air Conditioning*\n\nCooking\n\nLaundry and Dishwashing\n\nUniversal Technician (All three specialties plus basic skills)\n\n*Requires proof of EPA Refrigerant Recovery Certification\n\nTo be NASTeC certified, candidates must pass a Basic Skills Exam and at least one of the three specialty exams.\n\nTechnicians who pass all 4 exams (the basic skills exam and specialties) are certified as NASTeC Universal Technicians, the highest available level of recognition for technical expertise given by the major home appliance service industry.\n\nTechnicians who pass only the Basic Skills Exam receive a “recognition of achievement” from NASTeC.\n\nExam Policies\n\nThe NASTeC program consists of the following exams:\n\nBasic Skills Examination: 75 multiple-choice questions\n\nSpecialty Examinations: Washer, Dryer, Dishwasher, Disposer and Trash\n\nCompactor Certification Examination: 40 multiple-choice questions\n\nRange/Oven and Microwave Oven Certification Examination: 40 multiple-choice questions\n\nRefrigerator/Freezer, Room Air Conditioner and Dehumidifier Certification Examination: 40 multiple-choice questions\n\nCandidates applying for NASTeC Certification must pass the Basic Skills Examination plus at least 1 of the 3 specialty examinations. Candidates passing the Basic Skills Examination and all 3 specialty examinations are certified as Universal Technicians.\n\nNote: If a candidate fails the Basic Skills Exam, yet passes 1 or more of the specialty examinations during the same test administration, the passing score(s) on the specialty exam(s) is considered null unless the candidate retakes and successfully passes the basic exam within 1 year from the original date of testing. If not, the candidate must reapply for the Basic Skills and the specialty examination(s) to qualify for certification. NASTeC certification will not be issued unless the candidate passes both the Basic Skills Examination and one specialty within the one-year period\n\nStatement of Non-Discrimination Policy\n\nNASTeC does not discriminate among applicants on the basis of age, gender, race, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation or marital status.\n\nCertification\n\nThe National Appliance Service Technician Certification (NASTeC) program was developed by an Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) task force consisting of manufacturer, retailer, independent service and vocational educator representatives to achieve the following objectives:\n\nTo promote and recognize competency in the diagnosis, repair and maintenance of major home appliances (refrigerators, room air conditioners, freezers, washing machines, clothes dryers, dishwashers, food waste disposers, compactors, ranges, ovens, cooktops and microwave ovens).\n\nTo provide employers with a reliable measure of an individual technician’s knowledge and abilities.

Candidates passing the Basic Skills Exam plus one or more of the specialty examinations will receive a NASTeC certificate and wallet card. Candidates successfully passing the exams are permitted to wear the official certification patch on their uniforms. The patch design varies with the level of certification earned. A blue bar is available to those passing the Washer, Dryer, Dishwasher, Disposer and Trash Compactor Exam; a white bar to those passing the Refrigerator/ Freezer, Room Air Conditioner and Dehumidifier Exam; a red bar to those passing the Range/ Oven and Microwave Oven Exam; and a gold bar to those passing all four exams and achieving Universal Technician status. Patches and bars are awarded upon passing the appropriate exam(s), and additional can be purchased from NASTeC.\n\nAdditionally, NASTeC will promote certification with the consumer media and assist NASTeC-certified technicians in promoting their certification status locally.\n\nScheduling Exams\n\nTo schedule an exam, complete the online application or go to the ISCET website, click on the “Online Store”…or click on “Register for an Exam” and follow the instructions.

The ANSI/ISO body is the standards organization to which most organizations worldwide follow for the operation of their business. These changes revolve around renewal of certification versus lifetime. The standard adopted is to require that certifications have a renewal path and they should not be lifetime. This path is to apply to all past and future certifications. This new standard has been adopted by all the major certification organizations worldwide. The standard allows the organization the freedom to choose how they will treat current certifications and how renewals will be handled. ISCET, being a recognized leader in the electronics certification, has studied and adopted a new certification model to address these new standards.\n\nEffective September 1, 2013, all certifications passed after this date will require renewal every 2 years. Recognizing our duty to our current lifetime certificate holders we will not require them to renew their certificate but those who chose not to by August 31, 2015 will have their certification listed as “Legacy”, which will indicate they have not chosen to renew their certification under the current standards. Holders of Associate CET and Associate CET+ certifications taken before September 1, 2013 will expire at the 4-year anniversary of their certificate unless renewed using continuing education. ISCET will use the “Continuing Education” model for renewal of certificates. This requires all certified persons to accumulate 20 clock hours of training (i.e. attending classes at schools, manufacturer events, or conventions), passing additional certifications in their field, self-study or teaching over a two year period. Individuals who meet the renewal standard will have their certification listed as “Registered” to indicate their commitment to keep their knowledge and skills current for a changing industry.\n\nIn order to assure that all holders of ISCET certification are still valued by industry these changes are necessary. In keeping with our commitment to our certificate holders we offer the renewal of their certificates at no charge, while they are current members of ISCET. Certificate holders who are not members will be charged a $50 fee for the first certification and $10 for each additional. If the certificate holder renewal totals $70 or more, the fee will be capped at $70 and they will automatically be enrolled as a member of ISCET with all eligible renewals processed. (Example: A CET who holds a Journeyman in Computers, a CSR, a CSM and a MST who is not a member of ISCET would be charged a maximum of $70 which would automatically enroll them as members and the listed certifications would be registered if all education requirements have been met.)\n\nRecertification\n\nCertifications awarded by NASTeC should be renewed every 2 years. Registration is accomplished by taking courses designed to keep abreast of technology advances, reading published books and/or articles having to do with advancing technology, etc.\n\nNASTeC Basic Certified Appliance Technician (CAT) certification holders will be required to renew their certification every 2 years. Individuals certified prior to 9/1/2013 must renew their certification by 8/31/2015 or the certification will be moved to “Legacy” status. NASTeC Basic Certified Appliance Technicians can renew their certification by 1) passing a NASTeC Journeyman level Certified Appliance Technician examination within the next 24 months or 2) completing 20 clock hours of appliance continuing education within the 24 months prior to the expiration of their certification.\n\nCEU credits must be earned during the two years prior to the expiration of your certification to be valid.\n\nQuestions About the Exam\n\nCandidates will not have access to the examinations or to specific questions or answers. Candidates may comment on any test question, the administration of the examination or the test center facilities in writing addressed to NASTeC, P. O. Box 378, Hillsboro, TX 76645.\n\nDuplicate Score Reports and Certification Identification\n\nRequests for duplicate score reports must be made in writing to NASTeC.
