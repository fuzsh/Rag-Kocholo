        "text": "Industrial Goods vs. Consumer Goods: An Overview\n\nIndustrial goods are materials that are used to produce consumer goods, which are the finished products sold to and used by consumers. Industrial goods include machinery, manufacturing plants, raw materials, and any other product or component used by producers.\n\nConsumer goods are any products, whether luxuries or necessities, that are ready for consumption by members of the public.\n\nIndustrial Goods\n\nIndustrial goods are classified as either production goods or support goods. Production goods are used to manufacture a finished product, while support goods, such as machinery and equipment, are necessary to the production process.\n\nUnlike consumer goods, which are purchased by the general public, there are very specific buyers of industrial goods. They include buyers of components, such as car manufacturers, those who purchase and install machinery, and distributors who buy industrial goods for resale.\n\nCharacteristics of industrial goods include:\n\nRational buying power: The decision to buy industrial goods is rational compared to the decision to buy consumer goods, which may be driven by psychology, status consciousness, or matters of taste.\n\nComplex product lines: Industrial goods are often complex and technically advanced. Those who use them must be highly skilled.\n\nHigher purchase value: Industrial goods typically come with a higher price tag because they are long-lasting and expensive to build.\n\nHigh level of investment: Those who need to will often invest a lot of money to purchase industrial goods.\n\nCompanies involved in the industrial goods sector represent a variety of industries including machinery, construction, defense, aerospace, and housing.\n\nConsumer Goods\n\nConsumer goods are tangible commodities produced and purchased to satisfy the wants or needs of a buyer. That's why these goods are also referred to as final goods or end products.\n\nThey are goods that consumers typically find stocked on store shelves. As such, they can be purchased for use at home, school, or work, for recreational or personal use.\n\nConsumer goods are divided into three different types: Durable goods, non-durable goods, or consumer services.\n\nDurable Goods\n\nDurable goods have a lifespan of three or more years. The consumption of a durable good is spread out over the entire life of the good, which causes demand for maintenance and upkeep.\n\nBicycles, furniture, home appliances, and cars are all durable goods.\n\nNon-Durable Goods\n\nNon-durable goods are purchased for immediate consumption or use. These goods generally have a lifespan of fewer than three years.\n\nFood, beverages, and clothing are examples of non-durable goods.\n\nConsumer Services\n\nConsumer services are intangible products or services that are produced and consumed at the same time.\n\nHaircuts and car washes are typical examples of consumer services.\n\nBecause of consumer buying patterns, consumer goods also are typically classified into four different categories including convenience, shopping, specialty, and unsought goods.\n\nConvenience goods: These products are ready to be purchased. Milk is a convenience good.\n\nShopping goods: These goods may require research, planning, and thought as part of the purchasing process. Electronics and furniture are examples.\n\nSpecialty goods: This category is composed of goods that are deemed to be luxuries. Jewelry is an example.\n\nUnsought goods: Unsought goods are overlooked by most consumers most of the time and are bought only as needed. Life insurance and funeral services are examples.\n\nKey Differences\n\nThere are other key differences between industrial and consumer goods. The market for Industrial goods is limited to a few buyers, and the output of them is relatively small. Consumer goods are bought by everyone, and most are produced in mass quantities.\n\nDemand also differs between both types of goods. Industrial goods are driven by derived or indirect demand. This demand stems from the need to provide finished products to consumers. Demand for consumer goods is direct demand which results from the usefulness of a product or service.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSome industrial products are out there for all to see, like UPS trucks. Most are rarely seen by anyone other than the workers who operate them behind the scenes in manufacturing facilities.\n\nHowever, industrial goods are necessary to the creation of consumer goods. Those are the goods we all see on store shelves from day to day."
