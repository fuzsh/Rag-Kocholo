        "text": "Welcome to the Google Pay for Business Policy Center. Here you’ll find the policies which apply to anyone using Google Pay to do business, including merchants joining Google Pay for Business as business partners. They also include our rules for creating high quality offers and communications on Google Pay for Business.\n\nOur policies cover the following areas:\n\nProhibited products and services: Products and services which may not be sold on Google Pay by merchants or billers including Google Pay for Business business partners\n\nRestricted products and services: Products and services which may not be the subject of Google Pay for Business Offers\n\nOffer and communications content\n\nInappropriate content: Unacceptable content for communications and offer text and images\n\nOffer conditions and redemption: Quality standards for Google Pay for Business Offer conditions and fulfilment\n\nEditorial guidelines: Editorial and technical quality standards\n\nGoogle Pay reserves the right to expand or edit these policies at any time. Google Pay will also exercise its sole discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these policies in conjunction with the product's Terms of Service.\n\nProhibited products and services\n\nTo become a Google Pay for Business business partner or use Google Pay as a merchant or biller, you must comply with our policies on prohibited products and services. These restrictions would apply regardless of whether the prohibited products or services form your entire inventory or only a part of it. Businesses who trade in any products or services prohibited by applicable laws are not allowed to use Google Pay as billers or merchants, or become Google Pay for Business business partners. A non-exhaustive list of prohibited products and services includes the following:\n\nAdult products and services\n\nWe do not allow Google Pay to be used for pornography and other sexually explicit material. This includes but is not limited to: prostitution, escort or companionship services, or any product or service which promotes underage, non-consensual, or other illegal sexual themes.\n\nCounterfeit, illegal, or stolen products and services\n\nGoogle Pay (and hence Google Pay for Business) should not be used for transactions of illegal products or services; products produced in violation of a third party's rights; or counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark or logo of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.\n\nWe do not allow the illegal sale of products and services using Google Pay (e.g. fake currency, tickets; smuggled goods and goods in violation of export, import or labeling restrictions). Businesses are solely and completely responsible for verifying that all items sold by the business are authentic and legal in all applicable jurisdictions.\n\nCopyrighted material\n\nWe don’t allow Google Pay to be used for the sale of unauthorized copyrighted material. Examples include: copies of books, music, movies, and other licensed or protected materials including copies without proper attribution; and unauthorized copies of software, video games and other licensed or protected materials, including OEM or bundled software.\n\nBusinesses are solely and completely responsible for ensuring that they have any and all appropriate licenses or authorizations for the sale of copyrighted material.\n\nDangerous\n\nWe want to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don’t allow Google Pay to be used for transactions on products that may cause damage, harm, or injury (e.g. guns and other weapons, explosives, drugs).\n\nEnabling dishonest behavior\n\nWe value honesty and fairness, so we don’t allow Google Pay to be used to sell products or services that are designed to enable dishonest behavior. A non-exhaustive list of examples include:\n\nAcademic paper-writing and test-taking services\n\nDevices or techniques for unlocking technical protection measures\n\nHacking and cracking materials\n\nDevices for circumventing traffic rules\n\nFinancial products and services\n\nWe don’t allow the provision of any financial products or services (including cryptocurrency products or services), unless you hold a relevant licence from or are otherwise supervised by a competent national authority such as a financial sector regulatory agency or central bank.\n\nOffensive or Inappropriate\n\nWe value diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid offending users, so we don’t allow Google Pay to be used for supporting hatred, intolerance, discrimination, or violence.\n\nPolitical content\n\nWe do not allow Google Pay to be used for products and services which contain or promote political content. Political content includes ads for political organizations, political parties, political issue advocacy or fundraising, and individual candidates and politicians.\n\nPrecious materials\n\nWe do not allow the sale of precious materials in bulk. Examples: Bulk sales of rare, scarce, or valuable metals or stones.\n\nWholesale currency\n\nWe do not allow Google Pay to be used in the exchange of wholesale currency. Examples: Discounted currencies or currency exchanges; currency backed by precious metals.\n\nCountry-specific prohibitions\n\nGoogle Pay users, including Google Pay for Business business partners, are expected to comply with all applicable local laws and regulations in every jurisdiction where they do business. We err on the side of caution in enforcing our policies where there is any question as to the legality of the products or services offered. A non-exhaustive list of local requirements may be found below. Where these overlap with the general policies applicable to GPay for Business Policies, the country-specific requirements stated here will take precedence.\n\nIndia\n\nDowries\n\nWe do not allow products or services which facilitate or are related to the giving or receiving of dowries.\n\nGender determination\n\nWe do not allow products or services which facilitate pre-natal gender determination or pre-conception sex selection of any form.\n\nGambling\n\nWe do not allow Google Pay to be used for any sort of online or offline gambling where money or other items of value are paid or wagered in exchange for the opportunity to win real money or prizes based on the outcome of the game.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nGoogle Pay may not be used for the purchase, sale, or trade of cryptocurrencies in India. Examples: Initial coin offerings; cryptocurrency exchanges; cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nRestricted products and services\n\nDue to legal and cultural reasons, we limit the types of products and services that can be the subject of Google Pay for Business Offers.
