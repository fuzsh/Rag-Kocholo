        "text": "A home warranty is more than just a piece of paper or monthly bill, but is a home warranty required? Not necessarily. However, it provides invaluable reassurance when covered systems and appliances unexpectedly break down in your home. Now that's something worth celebrating.\n\nIf you like to save time and money, a home warranty is for you. When a system or appliance breaks down, you could pay thousands* for a single repair or replacement, or you could get a home warranty plan starting at less than $1 a day with AHS.\n\n*Repair/replacement cost is the eightieth percentile as reported in a nationwide survey of homeowners conducted in 2022 by ClearVantage for AmericanHome Shield.\n\nAHS helps provide our business with a consistent workflow that allows us to grow and increase our customer base. Our favorite part of working with AHS is the strong relationship we’ve built and communication. That bond really emphasizes trust, which creates a winning scenario for everyone – us, AHS, and most importantly, the members we service. AHS is the gold standard of home warranty companies.\n\nWe have been a service provider for AHS for 29 years and it has been a great partnership. By far, AHS is the best home warranty company in which to provide service. Our company continues to work with AHS because of the depth of its integrity and character. I absolutely recommend AHS to other skilled trade professionals."
