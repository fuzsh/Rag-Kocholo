        "text": "Here's a breakdown of the most significant energy use categories in the typical single-family detached home:\n\nAir conditioning and heating: 54%\n\nWater heating: 16%\n\nRefrigeration: 4%\n\nLighting: 4%\n\nAppliances and electronics: 23%\n\nYour electricity usage is measured in kilowatt-hours or kWh. When calculating an appliance or system's energy use, we calculate daily kilowatt-hours by multiplying the hours used per day by its wattage and get the kWh by multiplying that by 0.001. Learn more about calculating your appliances and systems' usage.\n\nHow much energy do air conditioning and heating use?\n\nAs your primary source of comfort from extreme outdoor temperatures, your HVAC system uses the most electricity in a home, clocking in at more than half of the average U.S. home's energy consumption. An average central HVAC unit uses more than 2,000 kWh of electricity per year, causing power plants to emit 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide! Try to reduce the workload of your HVAC system with these tips:\n\nUse ceiling fans - counterclockwise in the summer and clockwise in the winter\n\nTurn the thermostat up to 78°F in summer and down to 65°F in winter\n\nGet your air conditioner and furnace tuned up annually\n\nDraw your curtains during sunny summer days, but open them during winter to get free heat\n\nReplace your air filters\n\nDon't block inside vents or outside units\n\nDust and vacuum to prevent clogs\n\nDress lightly in summer and warmly in winter\n\nUse blankets and scarves for extra wintertime warmth\n\nRead more tips: Inexpensive tips to improve the energy efficiency of your HVAC | How do I take care of my air conditioner in the summer? | What temperature should I set my thermostat in the summer?\n\nHow much electricity does water heating use?\n\nThat's right, how you heat your water might be another reason your electricity bill is so high. As another often-used appliance, your water heater can account for as much as 18% of your home's energy usage. An average water heater typically runs about 3 hours a day, and the average household spends up to $600/year alone on water heating. Use these tips to take the heat off your energy bill:\n\nSet your water heater's temperature to 120°F or lower\n\nWash your clothes in cold water\n\nInsulate the hot water pipes\n\nTurn down your water heater when you go on vacation\n\nInstall low-flow shower heads and faucets\n\nUpgrade to a solar water heater\n\nHow much energy does lighting use?\n\nLighting accounts for about 4% of a typical home's energy use. How much energy light bulbs use can vary widely based on bulb type and usage. Reduce the electricity usage of your lights with these tips:\n\nTurn off lights when you leave a room\n\nUse energy-efficient LED light bulbs\n\nUse natural light, especially in winter, when you also get the benefit of heat\n\nChoose LED holiday lights and put them on timers so they don't stay on all night\n\nInstall motion detectors on outdoor security lights so they only turn on when you need them\n\nWhat other appliances and electronics use a lot of electricity?\n\nAppliances and electronics account for about 23% of the typical electric bill. Below are some tips on how to save on your major appliances' energy use:\n\nRefrigerator\n\nDon't overload your refrigerator\n\nKeep most-used products in accessible areas\n\nArrange contents for optimal efficiency\n\nSet your fridge to the manufacturer's recommended temperature\n\nRegularly clean behind and underneath the refrigerator to maintain airflow\n\nReplace older refrigerators with modern, energy-efficient models\n\nRead more tips: How much electricity does my refrigerator use?\n\nWasher and dryer\n\nWash full loads\n\nWash with cold water\n\nAvoid overfilling the machines\n\nUse drying racks when possible\n\nClear lint after each load\n\nElectric oven and stove\n\nOpt to use a toaster oven, microwave, slow cooker or other smaller appliance\n\nUse the oven and stove during cooler hours of the day\n\nDon't preheat unless it's necessary for the dish to cook properly\n\nTurn off the burners a few minutes before the dish is done and let the residual heat do the rest\n\nDishwasher\n\nWash full loads\n\nTurn off the heated dry\n\nWash during cooler hours of the day\n\nPre-rinse heavily soiled dishes to prevent the need for a second cycle\n\nElectronics"
