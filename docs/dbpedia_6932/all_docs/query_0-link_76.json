        "text": "Machine learning allows systems to learn from data collected. Under the hood, intelligent appliances have various sensors to monitor events like light and heat.\n\nWith continuous operations, these sensors collect data that can be used to train ML algorithms for specific appliances. This leads to better efficiency in operation in line with daily patterns and routines. For instance, through continuous usage tracking and pattern recognition, an intelligent coffee brewer can start making coffee at 7 am on weekdays and 8 am on weekends.\n\nML also continues to help in appliance automation and providing personalized user preferences. For instance, a smart vacuum cleaner can automatically start based on your schedule. Assume you typically clean your kitchen after dinner, the vacuum cleaner can start each night after dinner. It can also adjust its cleaning setting to mimic the settings you normally use for your kitchen.\n\nHere are some of the different ways AI is enhancing appliance functionality.\n\nAutomation: Smart homes are characterized by various interconnected devices, normally controlled by a central hub such as the Samsung Smart Things Hub. AI-powered hubs and platforms help integrate and automate multiple appliances, allowing homeowners to control multiple devices from a centralized platform. They use AI algorithms to learn preferences, analyze data from connected devices and make intelligent decisions.\n\nUsers can monitor their appliances and issue commands from a single interface or using voice commands.\n\nSmart Voice Assistants: Voice-enabled assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant use NLP and ML to answer questions. In their simplest form, you can direct these devices to add something to your shopping list or play a song using your voice. Additionally, depending on interoperability, these assistants can control other aspects of your home, including audio, blinds, and lighting. The ability to control different appliances and devices through voice-activated commands has led to great user experiences, in particular among the elderly and the disabled.\n\nPredictive Maintenance: Appliance failure may stem from a variety of factors such as hardware and software issues. Predictive maintenance enables the forecasting of machine downtime due to component failures, faults, and errors. This ability is highly beneficial for homeowners, as it can enhance the efficiency of large domestic appliances while simultaneously reducing costs. Moreover, predictive maintenance allows for the identification of specific faulty components, meaning that only the defective part needs to be replaced rather than the entire machine. This approach not only saves resources but also makes the process more environmentally friendly. With the widespread adoption of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), appliance maintenance has shifted from a reactive to a proactive stance, further streamlining the process.\n\nAnalytical models and condition monitoring use data such as vibration analysis and IOT sensors to identify patterns that can represent appliance malfunction or deterioration before they lead to safety hazards[1]. For instance, LG’s ThinQ technology uses sensors to monitor appliance performance to predict whether they need maintenance[2].\n\nPredictive maintenance can also involve using analytics over past data collected from appliances. It’s possible to use pattern recognition to determine the correlation between certain events and machine failure. For instance, it’s possible to determine how many runs a washing machine will have before certain assets show failure signs [3].\n\nOther ways AI enhances intelligent home appliances functionalities include:\n\nEnergy efficiency\n\nAdaptive cooking and baking\n\nPersonalized recommendations\n\nRemote monitoring and control.\n\nThe concept of a smart home is not new; it was conceptualized in the early 1900s[4]. Since then, there has been a massive leap in smart appliances' functionality and performance. For instance, appliances can now automate routine tasks in the house, such as security, lighting control, and energy management. Research studies expect the global smart home appliances market to reach USD 58.5 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.2% between 2022-2030[5].\n\nThe emergence of AI-powered Home Appliances: Manufacturers recognized early on that AI would play a significant part in the future of smart homes. Technology has evolved, and now they are AI-based integrated circuits running AI-powered home machines.\n\nIntegration of IoT and AI in the Smart Home Ecosystem: IOT refers to a collection of networked devices communicating with each other and even a data storage point like the cloud. The devices allow you to automate your home to a certain degree, such as remote controlling your light and heating. With AI integrated into IOT devices, homeowners can expect more convenience, security, and efficiency with appliances. For instance, an AI-powered smart security camera can now track movement, identify the type of movement and alert the homeowner.\n\nThere are many companies manufacturing home appliances globally. However, not all have integrated AI into their appliances. Here is a highlight of the top companies currently using AI in their home appliances.\n\nAmazon: The company produces voice-activated home appliances such as the echo dot smart speakers. Other such devices in their lineup include Echo Show and Echo Buds.\n\nSamsung: The company’s home appliances are used globally. The company is known for appliances with incredible energy savings capabilities using the AI energy mode. Some of its AI-powered home appliances include\n\nAI refrigerators\n\nAI Ecobubble washing machines\n\nAI dishwashers\n\nAI-enabled vacuum cleaners\n\nSmart TV\n\nLG: The company headquartered in South Korea also utilizes AI in major home appliances similar to Samsung. The main appliances that use AI in their lineup are LG’s AI DD washing machine, AI ThinQ refrigerators, and AI dishwashers.\n\nWhirlpool: The company is also involved in producing large smart appliances such as Smart Ovens, refrigerators, and washing machines. They integrate voice assistants for voice control of their appliances.\n\nSiemens: The company produces intelligent home appliances such as fridges, dishwashers, and smart ovens.\n\nAI-powered washing machines bring convenience to homes through understanding the washing cycle selections and schedules. The knowledge of the wash composition can be exploited to determine the correct amount of water, detergent, and completion time. Washers can also detect dirt levels and fabric types to recommend and select the best wash cycle and detergent amount. This leads to optimal resource utilization.\n\nFor instance, Samsung’s bespoke AI laundry pair washing machines use AI and advanced moisture detection sensors to determine the dampness of clothes. It subsequently optimizes the washing temperature and adjusts the washing cycle automatically to reduce clothes’ wear and tear[12].\n\nML algorithms such as random forest for classification and logistic regression can help achieve these results[13]. Although not explicitly stated, AI-enabled washer-dryers are also likely to use neuro-fuzzy and fuzzy ML techniques. They help the appliance to decide the amount of water and detergent required for a specific wash[14].\n\nAI-enabled appliances collect personal data such as voice recordings, fingerprints, location data, facial scans, and user preferences. Concerns arise to the extent the appliances collect such data. Additionally, companies could use this data to track user locations and habits for targeted marketing and advertising.\n\nAnother pertinent issue is third-party data sharing. Companies can share user data for purposes of algorithm improvement and advertising.\n\nFor instance, a research study has raised concerns about how AI virtual assistants, such as speakers, gather and share children's data. The information collected and shared by these appliances does not segregate between children and adult data, impacting children's privacy[19].\n\nUser awareness and stricter compliance with data privacy laws could go a long way to alleviate data privacy concerns. Users can opt out of personal data gathering and sharing to avoid privacy issues.\n\nAdditionally, appliance providers should detail how they plan to use the data gathered and offer ways for users to opt out of data-gathering schemes. Other ways to improve privacy include data deletion provisions, avoiding collecting children's data, and being accountable for the data collected.\n\nSmart home appliances now face an ever-expanding sphere of threats with the addition of an AI layer. Adversarial actors can now directly target AI algorithms and manipulate them to reach a malicious end goal[20].\n\nAttackers can carry out an “input attack” or AI model poisoning with the intent of manipulating the algorithm with a pattern of changes introduced to the training dataset. This can make the appliance malfunction or disrupt service provision because of compromise in the dataset.\n\nAI-powered devices collect a lot of user data and other preferences. Breaches can provide access to this data, which could lead to identity theft and other malicious activities.\n\nEstablishing trust is paramount to guarantee the uptake of AI-enabled smart appliances. A malicious act could damage the brand reputation of manufacturers, which could hinder adoption. Additionally, attacks such as distributed denial of service could cause damage in large areas, similar to the Mirai IOT bot that attacked smart devices in the US in 2016[21].\n\nManufacturers must use advanced encryption techniques, conduct regular audits across their systems, implement security by design principles, and use secure APIs to bolster security.\n\nHomeowners must also improve their home cyber security using simple strategies like secure passwords and virtual private networks(VPNs)\n\nAI promises to have reverberating effects in the smart home industry presently and in the future. As companies develop neural engines and AI chips, there’s a promise of better power and memory management for higher performance. Additionally, as research and development continue unabated, consumers can expect more appliances providing convenience and efficiency.\n\nFor instance, smart fridges are expected to be at the forefront of reducing food wastage. Studies show that about 88 million tonnes of food are wasted in the EU annually[24]. With fridge meal planning, item freshness tracking , and recipe suggestions based on available food items, it's possible to limit food wastage.\n\nWashers and dryers are likely to improve their efficiency through noise-based anomaly detection. Research into the area is progressing by analyzing functional information from these appliances using DNN[25]. This will power predictive analytics helping owners and customer service detect appliance malfunction early.\n\nCompanies like LG and Samsung are developing on-device AI chips to process vast amounts of data in real-time for better customer experience. With these developments, appliances will communicate together and with devices from other brands. For instance, the LG AI chip can process information in real-time, recognize environmental changes, and adjust appliance performance accordingly[26].\n\nThe next-generation voice assistant promises to feature a plethora of advancements, including a better understanding of complex commands, interpreting contextual cues, and advancing general intelligence. For instance, Amazon’s Alexa division leaders aim to equip their smart speakers with abilities beyond speech recognition. These assistants will also interpret facial expressions and hand gestures[27].\n\nWith the integration of AI into appliances, traditional home devices are being supercharged for greater effectiveness. Refrigerators can now meal plan for you and suggest recipes based on items availability, preferences, and dietary goals. With interoperability, a smart oven could be preheated based on your selected meal.\n\nIt’s not just fancy functionality that AI-enabled appliances bring. Samsung reports that its AI-enabled refrigerators and washers can reduce energy consumption by 70% with AI energy mode. The appliances study user patterns to determine user preferences and habits to provide continued convenience and personalization. Other positive impacts of AI-enabled devices include increased security, comfort, and personalization.\n\nHowever, there are challenges that still hinder production and adoption. The primary concern is the cost of development and acquisition. Additionally, in this era where cyber attacks have become common, consumers are still jittery over cyber threats and data privacy issues.\n\nAs AI technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and sophisticated AI-enabled home appliances in the future."
