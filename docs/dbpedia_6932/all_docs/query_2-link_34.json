INTRODUCTION\n\nThis guidance explains FDA's general recommendations and procedures applicable to the authorization of the emergency use of certain medical products under sections 564, 564A, and 564B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 2 as amended or added by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA).3 The provisions in PAHPRA, described in section II of this guidance, include key legal authorities to sustain and strengthen national preparedness for public health, military, and domestic emergencies involving chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents, including emerging infectious disease threats such as pandemic influenza. PAHPRA clarifies and enhances FDA’s authority to support emergency preparedness and response and foster the development and availability of medical products for use in these emergencies. These medical products, also referred to as “medical countermeasures” or “MCMs,” include drugs4 (e.g., antivirals and antidotes), biological products (e.g., vaccines, blood products, and biological therapeutics), and devices (e.g., in vitro diagnostics and personal protective equipment). This guidance finalizes the draft guidance, Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities (April 2016) and replaces the following two guidance documents, Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products (July 2007) and Emergency Use Authorization Questions and Answers (April 2009).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis document is intended to inform all stakeholders5 involved in emergency response activities and FDA staff of FDA's general recommendations and procedures for:\n\nIssuance of Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) under section 564;\n\nImplementation of the emergency use authorities set forth in section 564A; and\n\nReliance on the governmental pre-positioning authority set forth in section 564B.\n\nSection 564, as amended by PAHPRA, permits the Commissioner6 to authorize the emergency use of an unapproved medical product or an unapproved use of an approved7 medical product for certain emergency circumstances (discussed in section III.A of this guidance) after the HHS Secretary has made a declaration of emergency or threat justifying emergency use. The Commissioner may issue an EUA to allow an MCM to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by a CBRN agent when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Section III of this guidance addresses EUAs.\n\nSection 564A, as added by PAHPRA, establishes streamlined mechanisms to facilitate preparedness and response activities involving certain FDA-approved MCMs without FDA issuing an EUA, which can be a resource-intensive process. These authorities, and the definition of eligible products to which they apply, are discussed in section IV of this guidance. These authorities, which apply only to eligible FDA-approved medical products intended for use during a CBRN emergency, include provisions that:\n\nEmpower FDA to extend the expiration date of an eligible FDA-approved MCM stockpiled for use in a CBRN emergency and to establish appropriate conditions relating to such extensions, such as appropriate storage, sampling, and labeling;\n\nPermit FDA to waive otherwise-applicable current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements8 (e.g., storage or handling) to accommodate emergency response needs;\n\nAllow emergency dispensing of MCMs during an actual CBRN emergency event without requiring an individual prescription for each recipient9 of the MCM or all of the information otherwise required or by responders who may not otherwise be licensed to dispense if permitted by state law in the state where such dispensing occurs or if in accordance with an order issued by FDA; and\n\nPermit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to create and issue “emergency use instructions” (EUI) concerning the FDA-approved conditions of use for eligible products.10\n\nIn addition, PAHPRA amended section 505-1(k) to authorize FDA to waive Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements for CBRN emergencies.\n\nFinally, section 564B, also added by PAHPRA, permits government stakeholders to pre-position (e.g., stockpile, forward-deploy) MCMs in anticipation of FDA approval or clearance, authorization of an investigational use, or the issuance of an EUA, to enable these stakeholders to prepare for potential rapid deployment during an actual CBRN emergency. This authority is discussed in section V of this guidance.\n\nIII. EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATIONS\n\nThe EUA authority under section 564 allows FDA to facilitate availability and unapproved uses of MCMs needed to prepare for and respond to CBRN emergencies. The EUA authority is separate and distinct from use of a medical product under an investigational application (i.e., Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)), section 561 expanded access authorities,11 and section 564A emergency use authorities discussed in section IV of this guidance.\n\nA. EUA DECLARATION JUSTIFYING EMERGENCY USE\n\n1. Determinations to Support an EUA Declaration\n\nBefore FDA may issue an EUA, the HHS Secretary must declare that circumstances exist justifying the authorization (section 564(b)(1)). This declaration (referred to in this guidance as an “EUA declaration”),12 must be based on one of the following actions:\n\nA determination by the Secretary of Homeland Security that there is a domestic emergency, or a significant potential for a domestic emergency, involving a heightened risk of attack with a CBRN agent(s);13\n\nA determination by the Secretary of Defense that there is a military emergency, or a significant potential for a military emergency, involving a heightened risk to United States military forces of attack with a CBRN agent(s);14\n\nA determination by the Secretary of HHS that there is a public health emergency, or a significant potential for a public health emergency, that affects, or has a significant potential to affect, national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves a CBRN agent or agents, or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent(s);15 or\n\nThe identification of a material threat, by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to section 319F-2 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, that is sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad.16\n\nAfter the Secretary of HHS issues an EUA declaration based on one of these four determinations, and after consulting (to the extent feasible and appropriate given the applicable circumstances) with the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Director of CDC,17 the Commissioner may authorize the emergency use of an unapproved product or an unapproved use of an approved product, provided that other statutory criteria are met.\n\nIn appropriate circumstances, an HHS EUA declaration may support issuance of more than one EUA. For example, based on an HHS EUA declaration that circumstances exist to justify the authorization of emergency use of diagnostics for a specified biological agent, FDA may authorize emergency use for multiple diagnostic tests to meet the need, provided that each EUA meets the statutory criteria for issuance.\n\n2. Termination of an EUA Declaration\n\nWhen an EUA declaration is terminated, then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect.18 The HHS Secretary’s EUA declaration will terminate on the earlier of: (1) a determination by the HHS Secretary that the circumstances that precipitated the declaration have ceased (after consultation as appropriate with the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Secretary of Defense), or (2) a change in the approval status of the product such that the authorized use(s) of the product are no longer unapproved (section 564(b)(2)). For example, an EUA issued to allow an unapproved use of an approved product may no longer be needed if that product is later approved by FDA for the use permitted by the EUA.\n\nBefore an EUA declaration terminates, the Secretary of HHS must provide advance notice that is sufficient to allow for the disposition of an unapproved product, and of any labeling or other information provided related to an unapproved use of an approved product (section 564(b)(3)).19\n\nB. EUA MEDICAL PRODUCTS\n\n1. Criteria for Issuance\n\nDuring the effective period of the HHS Secretary's EUA declaration, FDA may authorize the introduction of a medical product into interstate commerce when the product is intended for use during an actual or potential emergency. EUA candidate products include medical products and uses that are not approved, cleared, or licensed under sections 505, 510(k), and 515 of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAfter the requisite determination and declaration have been issued, and after feasible and appropriate consultations, FDA may issue an EUA only if FDA concludes that the following four statutory criteria for issuance have been met. If the product does not meet the statutory criteria for issuance or is not otherwise an appropriate candidate, an alternative regulatory mechanism (i.e., access under an IND or IDE, which can include expanded access protocols)20 may be an appropriate means to provide patients access to an unapproved use of a product in a CBRN emergency.\n\na. Serious or Life-Threatening Disease or Condition\n\nFor FDA to issue an EUA, the CBRN agent(s) referred to in the HHS Secretary’s EUA declaration must be capable of causing a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.\n\nb. Evidence of Effectiveness\n\nMedical products that may be considered for an EUA are those that \"may be effective\" to prevent, diagnose, or treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions that can be caused by a CBRN agent(s) identified in the HHS Secretary’s declaration of emergency or threat of emergency under section 564(b). Potential EUA products also include those that may be effective to mitigate a disease or condition caused by an FDA-regulated product (including a product authorized for emergency use under section 564 or an approved product) used to diagnose, treat, or prevent a disease or condition caused by a CBRN agent.\n\nThe \"may be effective\" standard for EUAs provides for a lower level of evidence than the \"effectiveness\" standard that FDA uses for product approvals.21 FDA intends to assess the potential effectiveness of a possible EUA product on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis, as explained below. If, based on the totality of the scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective for the specified use, FDA may authorize its emergency use, provided that other statutory criteria for issuing an EUA also are met.\n\nc. Risk-Benefit Analysis\n\nA product may be considered for an EUA if the Commissioner determines that the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat the identified disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. In making this assessment, FDA must take into consideration the material threat posed by the CBRN agent(s) identified in the HHS Secretary’s declaration of emergency or threat of emergency if applicable (section 564(c)).\n\nIn determining whether the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, FDA intends to look at the totality of the scientific evidence to make an overall risk-benefit determination. Such evidence, which could arise from a variety of sources, may include (but is not limited to): results of domestic and foreign clinical trials, in vivo efficacy data from animal models, and in vitro data, available for FDA consideration. FDA will also assess the quality and quantity of the available evidence, given the current state of scientific knowledge. The types of evidence that FDA may consider and that should be submitted to support a request for an EUA are discussed more fully in section III.D.2 of this guidance.\n\nd. No Alternatives\n\nFor FDA to issue an EUA, there must be no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the candidate product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the disease or condition. A potential alternative product may be considered “unavailable” if there are insufficient supplies of the approved alternative to fully meet the emergency need. A potential alternative product may be considered \"inadequate\" if, for example, there are contraindicating data for special circumstances or populations (e.g., children, immunocompromised individuals, or individuals with a drug allergy), if a dosage form of an approved product is inappropriate for use in a special population (e.g., a tablet for individuals who cannot swallow pills), or if the agent is or may be resistant to approved and available alternative products.\n\n2. Categories of Products\n\nMCMs that may be considered for an EUA include unapproved products as well as approved products intended for unapproved uses.22 Examples of \"unapproved uses of approved products\" include:\n\nUse of an approved antibiotic as prophylaxis based on exposure to, or treatment of, a disease caused by a bacterium (or class of bacteria) that is not included in the indications and usage section of the approved labeling for the antibiotic;\n\nSubstitution of a critical reagent of a cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) with another reagent that has not been cleared for use with the device.\n\nSubmission of an IND or IDE is not required for potential EUA products, although FDA anticipates that many unapproved products for which an EUA is requested will already be under evaluation through such mechanisms. In fact, human data derived in the course of studies conducted under an IND or IDE may help to support an FDA conclusion that the available evidence is adequate to support an EUA consistent with the statutory criteria for issuance.\n\nC. PRE-EUA ACTIVITIES AND SUBMISSIONS\n\nEarly engagement between an industry or government sponsor23 and FDA about potential EUA products will facilitate more complete EUA requests and enhance FDA’s ability to review and ultimately grant the EUA as appropriate. FDA also recognizes that circumstances can change rapidly, and planning for a potential emergency may unexpectedly transition to a response effort. Therefore, FDA strongly encourages the sponsor of a product that might be considered for an EUA, particularly one at an advanced stage of development, to contact the appropriate FDA Center before submitting a formal request for an EUA. For purposes of this guidance, these submissions and related interactions are referred to as “pre-EUA” activities.\n\nFDA’s review of a pre-EUA submission is not an indication of FDA’s views on the product’s potential to be used under an EUA, or that the sponsor has obtained or submitted all the information necessary for FDA to review a formal request for consideration of an EUA. Pre-EUA activities are not a substitute for sponsor efforts to develop the product toward approval, including submission and, when appropriate, implementation of proposals for clinical trials designed to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition to design and implementation of clinical trials for development efforts in non-emergency settings, for some MCMs and for some emergency response plans, FDA encourages sponsors to design and propose appropriately controlled clinical trials that could be conducted during the emergency response either to run in parallel with an EUA or instead of an EUA.\n\nPre-EUA activities may include discussions with FDA about a potential EUA product. Such discussions may occur prior to the submission of a formal request for consideration of an EUA or issuance by the HHS Secretary of an EUA declaration. They may also include discussions about the appropriate vehicle to use (e.g., IND or IDE, Master File, pre-EUA submission) for submitting data on the product prior to submission of a formal request for consideration of an EUA.\n\nGenerally, FDA recommends that a sponsor submitting data as part of \"pre-EUA” activities follow recommendations for submitting pre-IND, IND, and device pre-submissions to the relevant medical product Center.24 A \"pre-EUA\" submission is typically separate from other developmental submissions on file with FDA; its existence does not imply that any specific set of qualifications has been met but represents the initiation of a series of preliminary interactions to discuss potential suitability for EUA consideration. In addition, FDA requests that the sponsor follow the recommendations for the content of the submission outlined in section III.D.2 of this guidance and for the format of the submission contained in section III.D.3 of this guidance.\n\nAs with requests for issuance of EUAs, FDA prioritizes its pre-EUA activities based on a variety of factors. Many of these are discussed more fully in section III.D.4.a of this guidance. Examples of additional factors FDA may take into account in prioritizing pre-EUA activities may include: progress on product development targets or milestones; competing FDA obligations or exigent circumstances (e.g., user fee deadlines, other agency priorities); and whether there is a significant likelihood that the product would be retained in or added to government stockpiles if the product is authorized for use in an emergency. The extent of, and timelines for, review of such submissions will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the nature of the submission (e.g., whether an IND or IDE for the product already is on file), the circumstances of the emergency, and the workload of the review staff.\n\nD. REQUEST FOR AN EUA\n\n1. Preparedness and Response\n\nFDA can issue an EUA not only during an emergency to support a rapid public health response, but also for significant potential of an emergency (e.g., in advance of an emergency) based on the requisite EUA declaration by the HHS Secretary, to support preparedness planning. The circumstances of a CBRN emergency may afford FDA or other stakeholders little time to consider the statutory criteria and appropriate conditions to ensure safe and effective use of an MCM when an event occurs. For instance, some CBRN events may require dispensing of MCMs within just a few hours of identification or notification of an exposure. It may be necessary to use other MCMs, such as IVDs, to identify the presence of a CBRN agent in an individual. An EUA issued before an emergency could permit use of an MCM during an emergency without the need for further authorization by FDA, assuming no new information about the product or emergency requires amendment and/or reissuance of the EUA. Section 564 thus reflects the fact that some scenarios may support issuance of an EUA before an emergency (including if the emergency is occurring in another country but not yet in the U.S.) to better enable federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to plan for such use during an emergency.\n\nBased on experience, FDA expects that many requests for an EUA will be submitted by government sponsors (e.g., HHS or the Department of Defense (DoD)), although industry sponsors may also submit such a request.\n\n2. Information Recommendations\n\na. Summary of Recommended Information and/or Data\n\nFDA recommends that a request for an EUA include a well-organized summary of the available scientific evidence regarding the product's safety and effectiveness, risks (including an adverse event profile) and benefits, and any available, approved alternatives to the product. The exact type and amount of data needed to support an EUA may vary depending on the nature of the declared emergency or threat of emergency and the nature of the candidate product. FDA may seek additional data and information on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA are met.25\n\nFDA recommends that the following information be submitted in any request for an EUA:\n\nA description of the product and its intended use (e.g., identification of the serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which the product may be effective; where, when, and how the product is anticipated to be used; and/or the population(s) for which the product may be used);\n\nA description of the product's FDA approval status (e.g., whether the product is unapproved or whether it is approved but the EUA is for an unapproved use); whether the product or intended use is under an investigational application (e.g., if an IND/IDE is in effect or has been submitted; whether the product is approved in a foreign country for either the proposed use or another use; information on the use of the medical product by either a foreign country or an international organization (e.g., the World Health Organization (WHO));\n\nThe need for the product, including identification of any approved alternative product(s) and their availability and adequacy for the proposed use, and the unmet need(s) the EUA would address;\n\nAvailable safety and effectiveness information for the product (discussed in more detail below);\n\nA discussion of risks and benefits, including available information concerning the threats posed by the CBRN agent(s) involved (discussed in more detail below within this section);\n\nInformation on chemistry (as applicable), manufacturing, and controls; a list of each site where the product, if authorized, is or would be manufactured, and the current CGMP status of the manufacturing site(s);\n\nInformation about the quantity of finished product on hand and the surge capabilities of the manufacturing site(s);\n\nInformation comparable to an FDA-approved package insert or instructions for use; drafts of the “Fact Sheets” to be furnished to health care professionals or authorized dispenser26 and recipients of the product, which typically are part of pre-EUA discussions (see section III.E.1 of this guidance); and a discussion of the feasibility of providing such information in an emergency;\n\nIf seeking an extension of a product’s labeled expiration date, any available information in support of such an extension27 (e.g., information on product stability such as test results; prior and anticipated storage and handling conditions; the lots, batches, or other units affected; any prior expiration date extensions; and for medical devices, an explanation of labeled expiration date, such as whether the inclusion of such information was based on a premarket requirement, requirements of another regulatory body, or a business decision); and\n\nAny right of reference28, as applicable.\n\nb. Recommended Safety Information\n\n(i) In General\n\nThe amount and type(s) of safety information that FDA recommends be submitted as part of a request for an EUA will differ depending upon a number of factors, including whether the product is approved for another indication and, in the case of an unapproved product, the product's stage of development. FDA anticipates that, for some products, data from controlled clinical trials will be available. For others, FDA expects to consider clinical experience from other than a controlled trial if the circumstances warrant. In addition, for some devices (e.g., IVDs), if clinical data are not available, FDA may consider accepting data solely from bench testing, if the circumstances warrant. FDA expects to interpret safety information in light of the seriousness of the clinical condition, alternative diagnostics, prophylaxis, or alternative therapies (if any), and the specific circumstances of the emergency or threat of emergency. FDA encourages any sponsor of a candidate product to have early discussions with FDA (even before a determination of actual or potential emergency) about the nature and type of safety data that might be appropriate to submit to FDA.\n\n(ii) Unapproved Uses of Approved Products\n\nIf the new indication uses a similar dose, duration, route of administration, or mechanism of action (as appropriate given the nature of the product), and the intended patient population is similar, to that for which the product is approved, FDA recommends that the request for an EUA reference the approved application, including right of reference as applicable. If the new use poses a different risk to the patient population (e.g., suggesting the possibility of increased toxicity), FDA recommends that information from relevant in vitro studies, animal toxicology studies, and (if available) human clinical data and experience be provided to support such a use.\n\n(iii) Unapproved Products\n\nThe range of available data for unapproved products will differ widely. FDA recommends that any request for consideration for an EUA include available preclinical testing data, such as in vitro and animal toxicology data. FDA also encourages that human safety information from clinical trials and individual patient experience be provided, if available. Data submitted in the request should attempt to link the likely exposure to the MCM to any relevant, existing preclinical data. Similarly, when animal data are used, sufficient information should be provided to link the results of these data to expected exposures to the MCMs related to the proposed use in humans. Any information on safety associated with use in humans of this or related compounds or devices of a similar design should also be submitted.\n\nc. Recommended Effectiveness Information\n\nFDA recognizes that comprehensive effectiveness data are unlikely to be available for every EUA candidate product, and the information necessary to authorize emergency use of a product will also depend on the circumstances of the CBRN emergency, as well as available knowledge about the product's safety profile. FDA plans to assess the sufficiency of the effectiveness data and the risk-benefit profile of each candidate product on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFDA recommends that requests for consideration for EUAs include29 any available relevant scientific evidence regarding the following:\n\nProduct's mechanism(s) of action to diagnose, treat, or prevent the disease or condition underlying the request;\n\nFor drugs, preclinical testing data, such as in vitro evidence of the effect of the product in preventing or reducing the toxicity of the specified agent;\n\nData on activity or effectiveness in animals that would contribute to understanding potential effects in humans, including but not limited to any animal efficacy studies available for products being developed under the Animal Rule;30\n\nEvidence from human experience relevant to assessing activity, effectiveness, and dosing (e.g., in published case reports, uncontrolled trials, controlled trials, and any other relevant human use experience);\n\nFor drugs, data to support the proposed dosage for the intended use (including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data, and for vaccines or antibody therapies, immunogenicity and/or achievement of protective levels of relevant parameters of immunity); and\n\nFor IVDs, device performance data to support the intended use such as analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity, and data from testing fresh, contrived, banked or archived specimens.\n\nd. Other Data Considerations\n\nFDA recommends that a request for an EUA include the following types of data, as appropriate and to the extent feasible:\n\nWell-organized study reports that provide a complete assessment and analysis, including any statistical analyses, of available safety and effectiveness data and an interpretation of the findings. If final study reports are not yet available, any available interim study reports should be provided and clearly identified as such; and\n\nSource data for clinical studies, nonclinical laboratory studies, and any animal studies that contribute to assessing activity or effectiveness of the product in the treatment of the underlying disease or condition or a closely related disease or condition, such as case report tabulations for key studies; case report forms for all patients who died during the clinical studies and for all persons who did not complete the study due to an adverse event, regardless of causality; relevant reports in the published literature; and translations of source materials that are in a language other than English.\n\nFDA recommends that requests for EUAs include statements on whether the nonclinical laboratory studies were conducted in compliance with applicable Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies regulations (GLP)31 and whether the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with applicable Good Clinical Practice standards.32 FDA also recommends specifying the methods and quality systems used to ensure the quality and integrity of data from any animal studies submitted in support of an EUA request but not performed under GLP.\n\nData from any ongoing testing (e.g., longer term stability data) or other data or information that may change FDA's evaluation of the product's safety or effectiveness and that become available during the period of review or the term of the EUA. Such data should be submitted to FDA when such data become available, including any appropriately controlled clinical trials conducted in parallel with the EUA during the emergency response. Data that are required to be submitted under the condition(s) established as part of the authorization of an EUA should be submitted as specified in the EUA.\n\ne. Discussion of Risks and Benefits\n\nFDA recommends that a request for an EUA include a discussion of the candidate product's known and potential risks and benefits, which includes a synthesis of the data and information requested above, including:\n\nMeasures taken to mitigate risk or optimize benefit;\n\nLimitations, uncertainty, and data gaps;\n\nA description of circumstances, if any, under which the product should not be used (e.g., contraindications); and\n\nTo the extent known, information concerning the threats posed by the CBRN agent(s) (actually or potentially) involved, and anticipated response and operational considerations that may be relevant to an assessment of risks and benefits.\n\n3. Format of Submissions\n\nFDA recommends that each submission begin with a section that describes the contents and organization of the included materials. The sponsor of an investigational or marketing application for the product or anyone with a right of reference may refer to data or other information previously submitted to the FDA in a marketing application, investigational application, or Master File.33\n\nFDA expects material to be provided in a reviewable form and sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Nevertheless, FDA recognizes that, in rapidly developing or unexpected emergency circumstances, or when previously unanticipated or unavailable MCMs are being considered, it may not be possible for a sponsor to provide all of the requested data or to provide it in the format suggested in a timely manner. In such circumstances, FDA will accept and evaluate the request for an EUA based on data in the form the sponsor is able to submit. However, a request that is missing data, poorly documented, or otherwise incomplete will make FDA’s determination of whether the product's benefits outweigh its risks more difficult and could result in a request for additional information, the need for a longer time period for review, or a decision not to authorize emergency use of the candidate product.\n\nPrior to submitting any materials to FDA, FDA recommends contacting the relevant medical product Center (e-mails provided below) for any specific directions unique to the submission.

FDA PROCESSING OF AN EUA REQUEST\n\na. Prioritization of Requests\n\n(i) In General\n\nFDA intends to establish priorities for its review of requests to issue an EUA based on a variety of factors. These include:\n\nThe seriousness and incidence of the clinical disease or condition (e.g., based on federal requirements, federal partner prioritization requests);\n\nThe public health need for the product and, when known, the safety and effectiveness of other potential MCMs;\n\nThe urgency of the treatment need (i.e., the window of opportunity for treatment can vary for different medical conditions);\n\nAvailability and adequacy of the information concerning the likelihood that the product may be safe and effective in preventing, treating, or diagnosing the condition;\n\nThe potential role that use of the product may have in ensuring national security;\n\nWhether the product is included in government stakeholder stockpiles;\n\nThe extent to which the product would serve a significant unmet medical need, including in:\n\nA subpopulation (e.g., pregnant women, infants, and children, and immunocompromised persons)\n\nThe stage of the emergency response (e.g., evolving understanding of the disease or condition and/or MCMs in the context of an ongoing public health response, availability of previously authorized MCMs);\n\nWhether the request is from (or supported by) a government stakeholder (e.g., the proposed emergency use will be appropriately coordinated with, augment, and not interfere with official government stakeholder response efforts34);\n\nThe availability of the product, (e.g., the quantity and manufacturing capacity); and\n\nWhether other mechanisms, such as developing a clinical study protocol under an IND or IDE for investigational use, typically in coordination with government stakeholders, or granting access to an investigational product under an IND or IDE expanded access authority, might be more appropriate for allowing emergency access to products under development (e.g., when there are little or no safety or efficacy data available).\n\n(ii) Additional Considerations for Prioritizing Requests for an EUA in Advance of an Emergency\n\nThe statutory criteria for issuing an EUA are the same whether the EUA is issued before or during a CBRN emergency. Therefore, in deciding whether to issue an EUA in advance of an emergency for preparedness purposes, FDA will make a case-by-case assessment of product risks and benefits based on the totality of available safety and efficacy data consistent with the criteria for issuance of an EUA in section 564(c), just as it would in considering a request for an EUA to be issued during an emergency response.\n\nIt will not be appropriate to issue an EUA for every potential MCM or in anticipation of each emergency scenario. For example, FDA anticipates that, in all but the most catastrophic scenarios, only comparatively mature products (e.g., those with demonstrated safety data and in advanced stages of efficacy testing) are likely to meet the minimum risk-benefit criteria for an EUA for preparedness purposes. In addition, the extent to which the proposed use of an MCM is supported by operational planning, whether the MCM is already held in a government stockpile, and whether timely and comprehensive pre-EUA submissions have been available for FDA review will be relevant to the prioritization of a request for an EUA for preparedness purposes.\n\nNevertheless, the extent to which the sponsor is actively pursuing FDA approval for the MCM is relevant to FDA’s prioritization of requests to issue an EUA in advance of an emergency for preparedness purposes35, and the duration of such an EUA if issued. An EUA is not a long-term alternative to obtaining FDA approval, licensure, or clearance for MCMs; the issuance of an EUA in advance of an emergency (or during an emergency) is not an appropriate endpoint for new product development.\n\nSection 564 expressly states that FDA’s authority to allow emergency use of an unapproved product, or unapproved use of an approved product, does not authorize a delay in FDA's review or other consideration of any pending application. If an EUA remains in effect for more than one year, FDA must provide the sponsor written explanation of obstacles to approval and specific actions to be taken by FDA and the sponsor to overcome them.36 Moreover, FDA is required to review the circumstances and appropriateness of an EUA periodically, including progress made with respect to the approval of the product.37 FDA generally does not anticipate allowing an EUA issued in advance of an emergency for preparedness purposes to remain in effect indefinitely. If the sponsor is not actively working to advance the MCM’s development for an approval, FDA may reconsider the EUA's status and/or consider terminating the EUA.\n\nb. Review of Requests to Issue an EUA\n\nA formal request to issue an EUA generally should not be submitted until the Secretary of HHS has issued an EUA declaration under section 564(b)(1). In particular, although section 564 allows FDA to issue an EUA for preparedness purposes, in such cases the HHS Secretary must first declare that circumstances exist justifying such an authorization in advance of an actual emergency based on a formal determination of a significant potential for emergency or a material threat determination. FDA typically coordinates closely with HHS and other relevant government sponsors throughout the EUA process, from pre-EUA submissions to final disposition, including the need for issuance of the EUA declaration and any consultations on EUAs with federal partners.38 Moreover, a formal request for issuance of an EUA typically will have the benefit of FDA feedback based on pre-EUA submission activities.\n\nA sponsor seeking an EUA should submit its formal request in the form of an EUA submission, including reference to relevant pre-EUA submissions previously reviewed by FDA, and request to issue the EUA through the same process outlined in section III.D.3 of this guidance. Typically the data and other information in EUA submissions have already been reviewed by FDA and have had the benefit of FDA Center feedback based on pre-EUA submissions and interactions with FDA prior to submission of the request to issue an EUA.\n\nc. Disposition of Requests\n\nFDA is prepared to issue EUAs expeditiously (e.g., within hours or days) when circumstances warrant and adequate information has been made available for prior review through pre-EUA interactions. Generally, the timelines for FDA review and action on a request to issue an EUA will be determined on a case-by-case basis and will depend on factors such as:\n\nThe product profile;\n\nThe existence, if any, of pending applications for the product;\n\nThe nature of the emergency, potential emergency, or threat of emergency;\n\nThe organization and completeness of the request submission; and\n\nThe workload of the reviewing Center’s personnel.\n\nA letter to the sponsor authorizing the emergency use(s) of an MCM will be signed by the Commissioner (or his/her designee) and will include a description of the authorized product and its use(s), any contraindications for the product, the criteria for issuance of the authorization, the scope of the authorization, waiver of certain requirements (if applicable), and any conditions on the authorized use. An authorized EUA will consist of (1) the signed letter of authorization and (2) any accompanying authorized materials (e.g., Fact Sheet for health care professionals, Fact Sheet for recipients, instructions for use, etc.).39\n\nFDA may decline to review or issue an EUA based on any number of factors. For example, the candidate product may fail to meet the necessary criteria identified in section 564 and discussed in section III.B.1 of this guidance, or it may fail to meet any one of the factors given the circumstances of the emergency or threat of emergency (see section III.D.4.a of this guidance for a discussion of factors FDA will consider in reviewing requests for prioritization of EUA requests). Under such circumstances, the relevant product Center will notify the sponsor that the EUA review cannot be prioritized or FDA declines to issue an EUA for the candidate product.\n\nE. CONDITIONS OF AUTHORIZATION\n\nFDA may establish conditions on an EUA necessary or appropriate to protect the public health. Section 564(e)(1) establishes conditions applicable to unapproved products; section 564(e)(2) sets forth conditions applicable to unapproved use of approved products, which are similar, but not identical, to those applicable to unapproved products. Within these sections, some conditions are required (to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances of the emergency or threat of emergency), whereas others may be imposed entirely at the discretion of FDA.40\n\n1. Information Relating to the EUA Product\n\na. Information for Health Care Professionals or Authorized Dispensers\n\nFor an unapproved product (section 564(e)(1)(A)(i)) and for an unapproved use of an approved product (section 564(e)(2)(A)), FDA must (to the extent practicable given the circumstances of the emergency) establish conditions to ensure that health care professionals who administer the EUA product are informed:\n\nThat FDA has authorized the emergency use of the product (including the product name and an explanation of its intended use);\n\nOf the significant known and potential benefits and risks of the emergency use of the product, and the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown; and\n\nOf available alternatives and their benefits and risks.\n\nTherefore, FDA recommends that a request for an EUA include a “Fact Sheet\" for health care professionals or authorized dispensers that includes essential information about the product. In addition to the required information, Fact Sheets should include:\n\nA description of the disease/condition;\n\nAny contraindications or warnings;\n\nDosing information (if applicable), including any specific instructions for special populations; and\n\nContact information for reporting adverse events and additional information about the product.\n\nHealth care professionals or authorized dispensers will likely have very limited time to review Fact Sheets during an emergency and, therefore, FDA anticipates that Fact Sheets typically will be brief (i.e., a few pages). FDA makes available on its website Fact Sheets for products for which an EUA is issued.41\n\nFDA further recommends that Fact Sheets target the health care professional or authorized dispenser who has the most basic level of training, recognizing that individuals responding to an emergency may have different levels of training, could come from a variety of backgrounds, and may have different types of experience or speak different languages. FDA recommends that Fact Sheets accompany the EUA product in an accessible form (e.g., printable as a hard copy) when the product is distributed to the health care professional or authorized dispenser if practicable. To the extent consistent with other conditions of authorization, information on the EUA product also may be disseminated to health care professionals or authorized dispensers through mass media (including print, broadcast, radio, satellite, Internet, or other electronic means of dissemination), videos/DVDs, or direct communication from public health agencies.\n\nFor unapproved drug products, which do not have FDA-approved labeling for any indication, FDA recommends that, in addition to the brief summary information found in a Fact Sheet, the sponsor also develop more detailed information similar to what health care professionals are accustomed to finding in FDA-approved package inserts. For medical devices regulated, such as in vitro diagnostics, in addition to the brief summary information found in a Fact Sheet, FDA recommends the sponsor also develop separate Instructions for Use.42\n\nWith respect to an EUA that authorizes a change in labeling of an approved product, but for which the manufacturer chooses not to make such labeling change, the EUA may not authorize the product's distributor or any other person to alter or obscure the manufacturer's labeling (section 564(e)(2)(B)).43 In such a situation, however, FDA must, to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances, authorize a person acting pursuant to such EUA to provide, in addition to the manufacturer's labeling, appropriate information with respect to the product, such as that provided in the brief Fact Sheet described above.44\n\nb. Information for Recipients\n\nAlthough informed consent as generally required under FDA regulations45 is not required for administration or use of an EUA product, section 564 does provide EUA conditions to ensure that recipients are informed about the MCM they receive under an EUA. For an unapproved product (section 564(e)(1)(A)(ii)) and for an unapproved use of an approved product (section 564(e)(2)(A)), the statute requires that FDA ensure that recipients are informed to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances:\n\nThat FDA has authorized emergency use of the product;\n\nOf the significant known and potential benefits and risks associated with the emergency use of the product, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown;\n\nThat they have the option to accept or refuse the EUA product and of any consequences of refusing administration of the product;46 and\n\nOf any available alternatives to the product and of the risks and benefits of available alternatives.\n\nTherefore, FDA recommends that a request for an EUA include a “Fact Sheet\" for recipients that includes essential information about the product. In addition to the required information, the agency recommends that the content of the Fact Sheets for recipients include the following information:\n\nProduct name and explanation of the intended use of the product\n\nA description of the disease/condition;\n\nA description of items to discuss with a health care provider and adverse event information, including contact information for how to get more information and for reporting adverse reactions; and\n\nDosing information (if applicable), including specific instructions for home use or preparation (if applicable).\n\nFDA recommends that recipients be given as much appropriate information as possible given the nature of the emergency and the conditions of the authorization.47 Ordinarily, FDA expects that some written form of information will be given to recipients with the MCM, similar to the Fact Sheet for health care professionals or authorized dispensers. FDA recognizes that these Fact Sheets, like those for health care professionals or authorized dispensers, will generally be brief. To ensure that individuals of varying educational levels comprehend the information provided, FDA recommends that all written information be stated in the simplest language possible using techniques to improve health literacy.48 In addition, translations to other languages may be appropriate if practicable.49 FDA recognizes that some flexibility may be needed for health care providers or authorized dispensers to make minor, nonsubstantive changes to the fact sheets for recipients such as adding local contact information, using specific letterhead or minor format changes.\n\nFDA acknowledges that exigent circumstances may dictate the use of other appropriate dissemination methods. Therefore, FDA expects that information would be disseminated in the most effective and expeditious way possible to reach the recipient before administration or use of an EUA product.50 If, however, taking the time needed to provide such information would diminish or negate the effectiveness of the product for the recipient, FDA may include as a condition of authorization that the information be provided to the recipient as soon as practicable after dispensing. Other methods of dissemination may include internet posting, mass media, videos/DVDs, or direct communication from health care professionals and public health agencies.\n\n2. Monitoring and Reporting of Adverse Events\n\nFor an unapproved product (section 564(e)(1)(A)(iii)), EUA conditions for monitoring and reporting of adverse events are required to the extent practicable given the circumstances of the emergency; such conditions may be established for an EUA for an unapproved use of an approved product (section 564(e)(2)(A)), at the discretion of FDA.\n\nConditions may be placed to enable the collection and analysis of information on the safety and effectiveness of the EUA product during the period when the authorization is in effect and for a reasonable time following such period. FDA expects that the primary focus of adverse event-related conditions will be capturing serious adverse events and applying appropriate mechanism(s) for the collection of follow-up clinical information. Some reporting may be directed to predefined mechanisms to capture adverse event data (e.g., FDA’s Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting System (MedWatch) or Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)). FDA will work with product sponsors in some circumstances to develop proposals for more active data collection and follow-up mechanisms to capture adverse event information under the EUA. FDA encourages EUA sponsors to provide proposals for data collection and follow-up during pre-EUA interactions.\n\n3. Records\n\nTo the extent practicable given the circumstances of the emergency, FDA must establish conditions for a manufacturer of an unapproved product to maintain records and to grant FDA access to records concerning the EUA product.51 FDA anticipates that such conditions may relate to, for example, the number of doses, devices, or other unit(s) (including lot identification) that have been shipped or sold under an EUA; or the name and addresses of the facilities to and from which the EUA product was shipped. FDA may also impose comparable recordkeeping requirements on any person (e.g., an authorized distributor or dispenser) other than a manufacturer who carries out any activity for an unapproved EUA product (section 564(e)(1)(B)(iv)).\n\nFDA may also impose recordkeeping and records access requirements on any person (including a manufacturer) engaged in an activity for which an EUA is issued for an unapproved use of an approved product (section 564(e)(2)(A)). In addition to the examples noted above for unapproved EUA products, examples may include conditions relating to actual use of the product and disposition of any unused product, and monitoring of patients who have been administered the product under an EUA.\n\n4. Additional Conditions of Authorization\n\nFDA, on a case-by-case basis and to the extent feasible given the circumstances of the emergency, may establish additional conditions that FDA finds to be necessary or appropriate to protect the public health (section 564(e))52, such as the following:\n\nDistribution and administration — conditions may be placed on which entities may distribute and who may administer the product, and how distribution and administration are to be performed. In addition, conditions may be placed on the categories of individuals to whom, and the circumstances under which, the product may be administered. FDA anticipates that distribution and administration of EUA products will be performed according to existing official government response plans, as practicable and appropriate. In some cases, administration of an MCM may go hand-in-hand with dispensing the MCM. In establishing conditions with respect to the distribution and administration of an approved product for an unapproved use, FDA may not impose conditions that would restrict distribution or administration of the product when distributed or administered for the approved use.53\n\nAdvertising54 — conditions (e.g., limitations) may be placed on advertisements and other promotional descriptive printed matter (e.g., press releases issued by the EUA sponsor) relating to the use of an EUA product, such as requirements applicable to prescription drugs under section 502(n) and requirements applicable to restricted devices under section 502(r).\n\n5. Waivers or Limitations of Compliance with Other Requirements\n\na. CGMPs\n\nFDA generally expects that EUA products will be produced, stored, and distributed in compliance with CGMPs; however, limits or waivers may be granted in an EUA on a case-by-case basis, after consideration of the circumstances and of any alternative proposed approach (section 564(e)(3)).55\n\nb. Prescription Requirements\n\nFDA may waive otherwise applicable prescription requirements, to the extent appropriate given the circumstances of an emergency (section 564(e)(3)). For example, operational considerations for a large-scale emergency response may demand that large numbers of individuals receive a medical product at centralized locations or locations that are not traditional health care settings, typically called “points of dispensing” (PODs). In such situations, the goal is to dispense medical product as quickly as possible to protect the public health, so it may not be practicable for each person to interact with a licensed practitioner before receiving a product authorized under an EUA (e.g., authorized dispensers may be responsible for dispensing or administering some or all MCMs). FDA also expects to include such waivers in EUAs on a case-by-case basis, after consideration of the anticipated or actual circumstances of an emergency and the operational plans for a response.56\n\nc. REMS\n\nFDA may waive otherwise applicable REMS requirements based on all CBRN emergencies that would trigger an EUA (section 505-1(k)). If it is determined that a waiver is needed, the waiver may apply to all REMS elements.57\n\nF. CATEGORIZATION OF LABORATORY TESTS UNDER AN EUA\n\nSection 564(m) allows FDA, if issuing an EUA for a diagnostic device, to indicate whether the test can be performed at a point-of-care setting or only in a laboratory able to handle more complex tests. FDA may determine that a laboratory examination or procedure associated with such a device shall be deemed, for purposes of section 353 of the PHS Act, to be in a particular category of examinations and procedures, including the category described by subsection (d)(3) of such section (commonly termed “waived” devices) if, based on the totality of scientific evidence available:\n\nThe categorization would be beneficial to protecting the public health; and\n\nThe known and potential benefits of such categorization under the circumstances of the authorization outweigh the known and potential risks of the categorization.\n\nFDA may also establish appropriate conditions on the performance of the test. The complexity categorization made under this authority is effective for the same period as the EUA and is independent of that made under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.\n\nG. DURATION AND REVISION OF AN EUA\n\nFDA will specify the effective date of an EUA issued under section 564. In general, an EUA will remain in effect for the duration of the EUA declaration under which it was issued (see section III.A.2 of this guidance, which describes termination of an EUA declaration and its impact on existing EUAs), unless the EUA is revoked because the criteria for issuance as described in section III.B of this guidance are no longer met or revocation is appropriate to protect public health or safety (section 564(f),(g)).\n\n1. Revision and Revocation\n\nFDA will periodically review the circumstances and appropriateness of an EUA, including circumstances that might warrant revocation of the EUA. The review will include regular assessment based on additional information provided by the sponsor of the progress made with respect to the approval, licensure, or clearance of the unapproved product, or of the unapproved use of an approved product, for which an EUA was issued.\n\nFDA may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance (under section 564(b)(1)) no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety.58 Such circumstances may include significant adverse inspectional findings (e.g., when an inspection of the manufacturing site and processes has raised significant questions regarding the purity, potency, or safety of the EUA product that materially affect the risk/benefit assessment upon which the EUA was based); reports of adverse events (number or severity) linked to, or suspected of being caused by, the EUA product; product failure; product ineffectiveness (such as newly emerging data that may contribute to revision of the FDA's initial conclusion that the product \"may be effective\" against a particular CBRN agent); a request from the sponsor to revoke the EUA; a material change in the risk/benefit assessment based on evolving understanding of the disease or condition and/or availability of authorized MCMs; or as provided in section 564(b)(2), a change in the approval status of the product may make an EUA unnecessary.\n\n2. Product Disposition and Continued Use\n\nUpon revocation of an EUA or its termination as a result of the termination of the HHS EUA declaration supporting it, an unapproved product or its labeling, and product information for an unapproved use of an approved product, must be disposed of pursuant to section 564(b)(2)(B) and (b)(3).59 Notwithstanding any such revocation or termination, under section 564(f)(2) an authorization shall continue to be effective to provide for continued use in any patient who began treatment before revocation or termination (to the extent found necessary by the patient's attending physician). Any study or future use of an EUA product beyond the term of a declaration is subject to investigational product regulations (e.g., IND regulations).\n\nH. PUBLICATION\n\nFDA will promptly publish in the Federal Register a notice of each EUA, including an explanation of the reasons for issuance, a description of the intended use, and any contraindications of the EUA product. The agency also will promptly publish in the Federal Register each termination or revocation of an EUA and an explanation of the reasons for the decision. Although FDA is not required to publish notice of an EUA revision(s) in the Federal Register, FDA plans to post any revisions to EUAs on FDA's website at http://www.fda.gov/EmergencyPreparedness/Counterterrorism/MedicalCountermeasures/MCMLegalRegulatoryandPolicyFramework/ucm182568.htm.60\n\nI. OPTION TO CARRY OUT AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES\n\nIf a manufacturer is the sole source of an unapproved product authorized for emergency use, that manufacturer must inform FDA, within a reasonable time after the authorization, if the manufacturer does not intend to make its product available for use under the EUA (section 564(l)). The Commissioner does not have the authority under section 564 to require a person to carry out any activity for which an EUA is issued. Section 564(l), however, does not limit FDA's authority to impose conditions on persons who carry out any activity for which an EUA is issued.\n\nIV. EMERGENCY USE OF ELIGIBLE FDA-APPROVED MCMs WITHOUT AN EUA\n\nSection 564A allows FDA to facilitate certain emergency activities involving FDA-approved MCMs without an EUA. This authority is independent of the EUA authority under section 564. In the past, to address concerns about potential FD&C Act violations related to the activities discussed in this section involving MCMs, FDA has either: (1) exercised its enforcement discretion with respect to the activity; or (2) issued an EUA to ensure that use of such MCMs remains covered under any otherwise applicable protections under the PREP Act61 (discussed in section VII of this guidance). MCMs used under this authority qualify for applicable PREP Act protection.62\n\nIn some cases, FDA and CDC may coordinate activities under section 564A authorities including the issuance of an emergency dispensing order, waiver of cGMPs, waiver of REMS, extension of expiration dating, and/or issuance of EUI for specific MCMs.63\n\nA. ELIGIBLE PRODUCTS\n\nThe emergency authorities in section 564A apply only to those medical products that are “eligible” (as defined in section 564A(a)) (referred to in this document as “eligible MCMs”). Eligible MCMs must be:\n\nApproved by FDA;\n\nIntended for their approved use to prevent, diagnose, or treat a disease or condition involving a CBRN agent(s), or a serious or life-threatening disease or condition caused by a product used for such a purpose; and\n\nIntended for use during circumstances in which there has been either:\n\nA determination of an emergency or a significant potential for an emergency made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of HHS (as described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) , respectively, of section 564(b)(1)) (i.e., one of the three EUA determinations that may support issuance of an EUA declaration, as described in section III.A of this guidance); or\n\nA material threat (described in subparagraph (D) of section 564(b)(1)) identified by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to section 319F–2 of the PHS Act that is sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad (i.e., a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) material threat determination, which may also support issuance of an EUA declaration, as described in section III.A of this guidance).64\n\nB. EXPIRATION DATE EXTENSIONS WITHOUT AN EUA\n\nFDA may extend the expiration date of an eligible, FDA-approved MCM stockpiled for use in a CBRN emergency if the extension is supported by an appropriate scientific evaluation that is conducted or accepted by FDA. An \"expiration date\" is defined as “the date established through appropriate stability testing…to ensure that the product meets applicable standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity at the time of use” (section 564A(b)(4)).\n\nFor each expiration date extension granted, FDA must identify the “specific lot, batch, or other unit of the product”65 and the duration of the extension.66 In addition, FDA must identify any other requirements or conditions related to each expiration date extension that the Agency deems appropriate for the protection of the public health, which may include requirements for, or conditions on:\n\nProduct sampling,\n\nStorage,\n\nPackaging or repackaging,\n\nTransport,\n\nLabeling,\n\nNotice to product recipients,\n\nRecordkeeping,\n\nPeriodic testing or retesting, or\n\nProduct disposition.67\n\nThe expiration date extension authority in section 564A applies to any eligible MCM, including eligible MCMs tested through the federal Shelf-Life Extension Program (SLEP). Since the mid-1980s FDA has engaged with federal partners in SLEP; DoD administers the program, while FDA tests the stability of certain federally stockpiled drug products to assess and extend, as appropriate, the useful shelf-life of such products. The explicit expiration date extension authority added by PAHPRA does not displace the longstanding federal SLEP, but eliminates any uncertainty about the legal status of eligible products for which FDA authorizes an extended expiration date, whether or not FDA also issues an EUA.\n\nAt this time FDA is not proposing or recommending any changes to SLEP or procedures for expiration date extensions for products tested through SLEP. For drugs tested within the SLEP program, federal participants should continue to submit requests to extend the expiration date of eligible MCMs using established processes. FDA is considering approaches for expiration extension for eligible products that are not tested within the SLEP program. Government stakeholders should consult with FDA via email or letter to the relevant Center and OCET points of contact identified in section III.D.3 of this guidance.68\n\nAlthough FDA may rely on section 564A to authorize an expiration date extension without issuing an EUA, if an EUA is requested for a product that is nearing or beyond its labeled expiration date, FDA may consider extending that expiration date and imposing conditions in connection with an EUA request as discussed in section III.D.2.a of this guidance.\n\nC.WAIVER OF CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT AN EUA\n\n1. In General\n\nFDA may authorize deviations from otherwise applicable CGMP requirements for the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of eligible, FDA-approved products without issuing an EUA (section 564A(c)). Products that receive a waiver from applicable CGMPs will not be considered adulterated or misbranded under the FD&C Act. This includes requirements under section 501 or 520(f)(1) or applicable conditions prescribed with respect to the eligible product by an order under section 520(f)(2).\n\nAlthough FDA may rely on section 564A to waive CGMP requirements without issuing an EUA, if an EUA is requested for a product for which a CGMP waiver is also requested, FDA may consider waiving CGMP requirements and imposing conditions in connection with the EUA as discussed in section III.E.5 of this guidance.\n\n2. Procedures for Request and Issuance\n\nFDA may issue waivers on its own initiative, but expects that any such action will be uncommon. Since the need for a waiver will be driven by the exigencies and other demands of responding to a CBRN emergency, FDA expects that in most cases a waiver will be based on a request from a government stakeholder or other interested party. For example, government stakeholders or manufacturers of products intended for use in a CBRN emergency may submit a request for a CGMP waiver for eligible products based on actual or anticipated emergency response activities that necessitate the waiver. FDA recommends, however, that requests be submitted only after consultation with and among relevant government stakeholders (e.g., CDC, and government officials in adjacent jurisdictions) that are or eventually may be part of a coordinated or related response effort involving the CBRN agent(s) or MCM. For example, absent compelling justification and to maintain response consistency, FDA does not expect to grant multiple CGMP waivers for the same MCM or CBRN use. FDA generally will not issue a waiver based on a request from an individual state if FDA has already issued the same type of waiver for the same MCM on a nationwide basis. Similarly, if FDA receives CGMP waiver requests for a particular MCM from multiple states or federal partners at the same time, FDA generally anticipates it will issue a single waiver (if a waiver is appropriate). Advance consideration and coordination are critical to ensure appropriate consistency and avoid unnecessary duplication.\n\nFDA intends to evaluate requests for CGMP waivers pursuant to section 564A(c) on a case-by-case basis. A waiver may be issued when, based on the information available, the agency concludes it is reasonable to issue a waiver to facilitate a CBRN emergency response or preparedness efforts. Requests for waivers should include the following information:\n\nThe identity and quantity of the medical product involved (e.g., product name(s); dosage form(s) and strength(s); number of doses, units, lots, or other unit(s); and unit/lot identifiers, as appropriate);\n\nThe manufacturer's name, address, and contact information;\n\nThe FDA application file number for the product, if known (e.g., NDA, BLA, IND, IDE);\n\nThe actual or potential CBRN emergency for which the product is intended to be used;\n\nThe anticipated conditions (e.g., storage, handling, transport, packaging) that will or may deviate from CGMP requirements and for which a waiver is being requested, including why such deviation may be necessary and the anticipated duration; and\n\nAvailable information about the potential impact of the deviation on the safety or efficacy of the product (e.g., strength, purity, quality).\n\nFDA may request additional information to assess the request and decide whether to grant a waiver. A waiver of CGMP requirements pursuant to section 564A(c) may either (1) be issued independent of any other FDA action or, when appropriate, (2) be included with an emergency dispensing order under section 564A(d) (see section IV.D of this guidance).\n\nSubmit a request for a CGMP waiver for an eligible MCM via e-mail or letter to the relevant Center and OCET points of contact identified in section III.D.3 of this guidance.\n\nD. EMERGENCY DISPENSING WITHOUT AN EUA\n\nEmergency dispensing of eligible, FDA-approved products is allowed under section 564A(d) without adhering to the requirements of section 503(b) or 520(e). This authority includes dispensing such products without an individual prescription for each recipient (often referred to as “mass dispensing”)69 if: (: (1) permitted by state law where the product is dispensed (section 564A(d)(2)(A)) or (2) dispensed in accordance with an emergency dispensing order issued by FDA (section 564A(d)(2)(B)). This streamlined mechanism permits emergency response activities that involve an emergency dispensing strategy needed to meet immediate public health needs, but that otherwise may not comply with the FD&C Act’s prescription requirements.70 Like other provisions in section 564A, FDA may issue an emergency dispensing order to allow emergency dispensing of eligible products without having to issue an EUA. Products that are dispensed pursuant to section 564A(d) (i.e., under state law or under an FDA emergency dispensing order) will not be considered unapproved, adulterated, or misbranded under the FD&C Act.\n\nAlthough FDA may rely on section 564A to allow emergency dispensing of FDA-approved products without issuing an EUA, if an EUA is requested for a product for which emergency dispensing is also requested, FDA may consider waiving prescription requirements and imposing conditions in connection with considering the EUA (as discussed in section III.E.5 of this guidance).\n\n1. Procedures for Issuing Emergency Dispensing Orders\n\nStates may have in place provisions that facilitate emergency dispensing of eligible MCMs or may choose to take legal actions (e.g., pass laws, issue emergency orders) that facilitate emergency dispensing of eligible MCMs.71\n\nSection 564A(d) provides a mechanism for FDA to fill any gaps in state law or to ensure adequate and consistent emergency response within and across state lines by issuing an order to allow emergency dispensing of eligible MCMs (i.e., an emergency dispensing order). FDA may issue such an order before or during an emergency. However, to receive the protections from potential violations of the FD&C Act under section 564A(d), eligible MCMs may only be dispensed during (not before) an emergency, as may be determined by relevant government stakeholders (see section IV.D.2 of this guidance).\n\nFDA intends to issue orders to allow emergency dispensing when, based on available information about the MCM, emergency response plans, and operational needs, the agency concludes that it is reasonable to permit emergency dispensing of eligible FDA-approved products. FDA anticipates that government stakeholders will submit a request for an emergency dispensing order. However, in the event that FDA deems it appropriate to issue an order without such a request, FDA will notify the relevant government stakeholders (e.g., ASPR, CDC, DHS, and/or DoD, regional authorities) as appropriate.\n\na. Federal requests\n\nFDA expects that federal government stakeholders will initiate any requests relating to federally-maintained or federally-controlled MCMs, and to the extent possible, will consider emergency dispensing activities of the same MCMs at all jurisdictional levels including state, local, tribal, and territorial jurisdictions. For example, if both the CDC Strategic National Stockpile and state or local jurisdictions stockpile an antibiotic for use for post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax, FDA anticipates that a CDC request for an order to allow emergency dispensing for that antibiotic would address all other relevant government stakeholder stockpiles. FDA also expects that a federal stakeholder seeking an emergency dispensing order, or to which such an order is otherwise directed, will communicate with other government stakeholders as necessary to ensure a coordinated emergency response.\n\nb. Non-federal requests\n\nFDA also anticipates receiving requests relating to MCMs maintained or controlled solely by non-federal government stakeholders (e.g., public health officials at the state level or in major metropolitan areas that independently maintain MCM stockpiles) to address the possibility that such assets may be deployed independent of reliance on federal assets. FDA strongly recommends that such requests be submitted only after consultation with relevant federal government stakeholders (e.g., CDC), as well as other relevant government stakeholders (e.g., officials in adjacent jurisdictions) that are or may be part of a coordinated or related response effort involving the same CBRN agent(s) or MCM.\n\nc. Content of requests\n\nFDA anticipates that a request for an emergency dispensing order will include the following information:\n\nThe CBRN agent(s) involved;\n\nThe FDA-approved product(s) for which the order is requested (including the product name(s), manufacturer, quantity, dosage form(s), strength(s), dosing regimen(s), lot or batch number(s), expiration date(s), and any other identifying information);\n\nThe intended use(s) of the product;\n\nThe jurisdiction(s) to be covered (e.g., nationwide, state, region);\n\nHow soon the order needs to be issued;\n\nThe source of the product (e.g., Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), state or local MCM stockpile, multiple sources);\n\nThe proposed duration of the order; and\n\nThe relevant government stakeholders' roles in an anticipated response.\n\nFDA may also request additional information to evaluate and make a decision on the request. Examples of additional information include: information about anticipated dispensing strategies, dispensing locations, dispensing personnel, recipient screening, or how health care professionals or authorized dispensers and recipients will be informed about product safety, efficacy, and use during an emergency (e.g., whether corresponding CDC-issued EUI will be needed to accompany the product).\n\nd. Processing of requests\n\nSubmit a request for an emergency dispensing order for an eligible MCM via email or letter to the relevant Center and OCET points of contact identified in section III.D.3 of this guidance.\n\n2. Scope and Conditions of Emergency Dispensing Orders\n\nAn emergency dispensing order issued by FDA would authorize emergency dispensing, but not direct or require emergency dispensing to occur; government stakeholders typically will be responsible for determining when to commence emergency dispensing consistent with the conditions specified in the order. The agency expects that in most cases, an emergency dispensing order will allow dispensing in all circumstances in which government stakeholders reasonably believe that a need exists because of their constituent recipients’ known, suspected, or likely imminent exposure to the CBRN agent(s) identified in the order. FDA also expects that any dispensing contemplated within government stakeholder emergency response plans will, to the extent possible, involve guidance from licensed health care professionals in the dispensing of product. Nevertheless, an emergency dispensing order issued under section 564A(d) may also state that, in some circumstances, direct or immediate involvement or guidance by licensed health care practitioners may not be possible, and the emergency dispensing order may authorize others, provided the product is otherwise dispensed as part of the official government emergency response plan during a CBRN event.\n\nFDA may specify in the emergency dispensing order who is responsible for contacting additional government stakeholders who may become engaged in a response to a CBRN event covered by the order (1) to ensure that relevant government emergency response plans are coordinated or revised as appropriate, (2) to specify different or additional conditions as appropriate, including information provided in support of a request for issuance of an emergency dispensing order (e.g., to accommodate or address specific response strategies or operational considerations), and (3) when appropriate, to waive CGMP requirements under section 564A(c), as discussed more fully in section IV.C of this guidance.\n\nIn appropriate cases, FDA may also coordinate with CDC so that FDA issuance of an emergency dispensing order accompanies CDC issuance of emergency use instructions for the same MCM, as discussed in section IV.E of this guidance.\n\n3. Duration of an Emergency Dispensing Order\n\nIn most cases, an emergency dispensing order issued by FDA for preparedness purposes in advance of a CBRN event will remain in effect until it is revised or revoked by a subsequent FDA order. FDA may specify a duration (e.g., 1 year) for an emergency dispensing order, but, if it does so, may extend the order as appropriate.\n\nE. EMERGENCY USE INSTRUCTIONS WITHOUT AN EUA\n\nCDC may create, issue, and disseminate special emergency use instructions (EUI) concerning an eligible MCM’s approved, licensed, or cleared conditions of use (section 564A(e)).72 EUI are intended to be similar to “Fact Sheets” that have been authorized in past EUAs, and may be directed to health care professionals and authorized dispensers or to recipients of an eligible MCM. EUI may be created and disseminated both before a CBRN event occurs and during a response.\n\nDuring past public health emergencies, there were concerns that instructions for administering MCMs, even those MCMs that were FDA-approved for the disease or condition (e.g., doxycycline for post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax), that deviate from FDA-approved product labeling would violate the FD&C Act and thus invalidate any liability protection otherwise provided under the PREP Act. When an EUI is issued pursuant to this provision, that issuance would not deprive the product of otherwise-applicable PREP Act protection. Therefore, the EUI provisions offer enhanced flexibility for CDC to prepare and disseminate EUI concerning a disease or condition for which an MCM is FDA-approved, licensed, or cleared without further limitation. FDA and CDC interpret this provision as permitting the creation of EUI that describe how the approved drug may be used, for the disease or condition for which it is approved, but in ways that may deviate from or extend beyond the FDA-approved labeling. EUI would not, on the other hand, be permitted to describe uses of an FDA-approved product for diseases or conditions for which the product has not been approved.\n\nV. GOVERNMENTAL PRE-POSITIONING OF MCMs\n\nA new provision added by PAHPRA permits pre-positioning of MCMs without FDA approval when the product(s) is intended to be held (and not used) for emergency use (section 564B), allowing stakeholders to prepare for rapid deployment of MCMs during an emergency. This authority allows government stakeholders, or a person acting on behalf of a government stakeholder, e.g., an agent of the government stakeholder, to introduce into interstate commerce (e.g., stockpile or transport) a medical product intended for emergency use without violating the FD&C Act regardless of a product’s regulatory status (i.e., without an IND, IDE, or any other acknowledgement by FDA), but in anticipation that use will be permitted under an appropriate regulatory mechanism (i.e., FDA approval, authorization, or for investigational use).\n\nThe authority to pre-position MCMs applies to all categories of medical products intended for emergency use, including those that are approved, unapproved, investigational, or authorized for use under an EUA. However, a government stakeholder may only rely on this authority if the MCMs are in fact held and not used to diagnose, treat, or prevent the CBRN-related disease or condition until permitted under one of these mechanisms. This means, for example, that even though a government stakeholder may stockpile an unapproved MCM, additional action likely will be required to ensure that any pre-positioned MCM can be used when needed. FDA, therefore, recommends that government stakeholders also consider and, if appropriate, initiate steps to ensure an approval can be granted, or that an IND/IDE or EUA is in place or can be readily put in place if necessary.\n\nThose relying on this provision will have to maintain documentation that shows the product qualifies to be held for emergency use, including records reflecting the government stakeholder’s initial intent to hold and not use the MCM until such time as it may be used under an appropriate regulatory mechanism. At this time, FDA is not specifying any additional recordkeeping methods relating specifically to pre-positioned MCMs. The agency recommends, however, that to the extent feasible government stakeholders maintain sufficient records or other information to be able to readily identify their pre-positioned MCMs (e.g., by product name, manufacturer's name, dosage form and strength, quantity held, lot number) as well as the distribution, storage, and ultimate disposition of those MCMs.73 For unapproved products, this information likely will be an element of the records required to be maintained for use under an IND/IDE or EUA. In addition, this information will help minimize the risks of misidentification, theft or other loss, and product deterioration. As an example, an MCM that a government stakeholder cannot verify has been properly stored might not qualify for use under an EUA or for an otherwise applicable extension of the product’s shelf life because of a lack of information about the condition of the product.\n\nVI. PREEMPTION\n\nFDA anticipates that conflicts between federal and state law74 may arise when FDA acts under sections 564, 564A, and 564B if states have existing requirements governing the shipment, holding, dispensing, administration, or labeling of unapproved medical products or approved medical products for unapproved uses.75 Courts have stated that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution can operate to nullify both state legislative requirements and state common-law duties.76 Under the legal principles of implied conflict preemption, courts have found state law preempted where it is impossible to comply with both federal and state law, or when the state law \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"77 Consistent with this case law, section 4(a) of Executive Order 13132 states that \"[a]gencies shall construe... a Federal statute to preempt State law only where the statute contains an express preemption provision or there is some other clear evidence that the Congress intended preemption of State law, or where the exercise of State authority conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority under the Federal statute.\"78\n\nFDA believes that the terms and conditions of an EUA issued under section 564 preempt state or local law, both legislative requirements and common-law duties, that impose different or additional requirements on the medical product for which the EUA was issued in the context of the emergency declared under section 564. Similarly, an order or waiver issued under section 564A and pre-positioning under section 564B preempt state or local law, both legislative requirements and common-law duties, that impose different or additional requirements related to the activity authorized under sections 564A or 564B.\n\nTo the extent state or local law may impose requirements different from or in addition to those imposed by the EUA for a particular medical product within the scope of the declared emergency or threat of emergency (e.g., requirements on prescribing, dispensing, administering, or labeling of the medical product), such law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,” and “conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority under [§ 564].” The same rationale applies to an order or waiver issued under section 564A and pre-positioning of an MCM under section 564B.\n\nAffected state laws may include, but are not limited to, laws governing the administration of investigational medical products, such as informed consent laws and laws requiring Institutional Review Board approval, and laws governing the prescribing or dispensing of medical products, such as laws limiting who may prescribe or dispense medical products and under what circumstances.\n\nMoreover, the PREP Act, which expressly provides immunity from tort liability associated with certain MCM activities, preempts state laws that are different from, or in conflict with, any requirement applicable to a covered countermeasure under the PREP Act and relating to, among other things, any matter applicable because of a requirement of the FD&C Act.79 This includes actions taken to meet the terms of an EUA, an order or waiver issued under section 564A, pre-positioning of an MCM under section 564B, an IND or IDE, or any FDA approval of an MCM.\n\nIn an emergency, it is critical that the conditions that are part of the EUA or an order or waiver issued pursuant to section 564A—those that FDA has determined to be necessary or appropriate to protect the public health—be strictly followed, and that no additional conditions be imposed. To the extent there may be circumstances in which FDA would like people carrying out activities under an EUA to also comply with requirements contained in preempted state law, FDA anticipates incorporating such requirements into the terms and conditions of the EUA.\n\nSimilarly, an extension of expiration dating under section 564A(b), a waiver of CGMP requirements under section 564A(c), and an FDA order permitting emergency dispensing pursuant to section 564A(d) are actions intended to protect the public health by enabling rapid public access to potentially life-saving medical products during an emergency. State laws that govern CGMP requirements or the dispensing of products covered by an FDA extension of expiration dating, CGMP waiver, or emergency dispensing order and that impose different or additional conditions that would limit the access to eligible products covered by FDA’s action, would be an obstacle to achieving that goal. Therefore, FDA believes that state laws within the jurisdictional coverage of an FDA extension of expiration dating, CGMP waiver, or emergency dispensing order that impose more restrictive conditions or requirements on dispensing products covered by the FDA order, or pre-positioning of MCMs under section 564B will be preempted.\n\nAs noted above, however, state laws may permit emergency dispensing of eligible MCMs. Under section 564A(d), such laws may provide another basis on which government stakeholders may be able to provide for emergency dispensing without a prescription or adherence to other prescription requirements that might otherwise apply.80 An FDA order issued under section 564A(d) is not intended to replace those frameworks as long as they are not more restrictive than the FDA’s order in providing for access to the FDA-approved product(s) that the order covers.\n\nVII. LIABILITY PROTECTION\n\nApart from any applicable preemption principles, sections 564, 564A, and 564B do not confer explicit liability protections for stakeholders who carry out any activity under these authorities. The PREP Act,81 however, may provide for immunity from tort liability related to activities authorized under such authorities. More specifically, the PREP Act authorizes the HHS Secretary to issue a declaration (called a PREP Act declaration) that provides immunity (except for willful misconduct) for claims related to administration or use of countermeasures against CBRN agents to entities and individuals involved in the development, manufacture, testing, distribution, administration, and use of such countermeasures.82 The PREP Act authority, including the authority to issue PREP Act declarations, resides with the Secretary of HHS and has not been delegated to FDA.\n\nThe PREP Act liability protections apply to “covered countermeasures” as defined by the statute.83 Covered countermeasures include medical products that are approved, cleared, or licensed by FDA; authorized for investigational use under an IND or IDE by FDA; authorized for emergency use under section 564; or otherwise permitted to be held or used pursuant to sections 564A and 564B. As discussed in section IV of this guidance, in the past, EUAs have been issued in part to address concerns that certain activities related to MCMs potentially violated provisions of the FD&C Act, jeopardizing otherwise-applicable PREP Act protections. PAHPRA added sections 564A and 564B to the definitions of “covered countermeasure” in part to preserve these otherwise-applicable PREP Act protections.\n\nVIII. IMPORTING AND EXPORTING MEDICALPRODUCTS UNDER AN EUA\n\nAlthough an EUA is not an FDA-approval, a medical product authorized for emergency use under an EUA may be introduced into interstate commerce during the effective period of the EUA declaration, and as such, contingent upon compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization, may be legally imported and exported under section 801 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381). The letter of authorization should serve as appropriate documentation or certification that the product may be legally imported or exported.\n\nIn the past, FDA has received EUA requests for which the primary emergency use of the investigational medical product would be in a foreign country (e.g. for use in West Africa during the Ebola crisis). The assessment of whether to issue an EUA in these cases is the same as for any other emergency use: FDA must determine whether the requisite EUA determination, declaration, and criteria (as described in section III.A and III.B of this guidance) are met and consider whether it is feasible or practicable in the foreign setting to comply with the necessary and appropriate conditions of use (as described in section III.E of this guidance).\n\nIX. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OF 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 85 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.\n\nSend comments regarding this burden estimate or suggestions for reducing this burden to: Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002.\n\nThis guidance refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information for: adverse experience reporting for biological products is approved under OMB control number 0910-0308; adverse drug experience reporting is approved under OMB control number 0910-0230; adverse device experience reporting is approved under OMB control number 0910-0471; investigational new drug application regulations are approved under OMB control number 0910-0014; and investigational device exemption reporting is approved under OMB control number 0910-0078.\n\nAn agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control number for this information collection is 0910-0595 (expires 09/30/2025).\n\nList of Acronyms\n\nAssistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nChemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)\n\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)\n\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP)\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS)\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS)\n\nDepartment of Defense (DoD)\n\nEmergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)\n\nEmergency Use Instructions (EUI)\n\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)\n\nFederal Shelf-Life Extension Program (SLEP)\n\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)\n\nGood Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies regulations (GLP)\n\nInvestigational Device Exemption (IDE)\n\nInvestigational New Drug Application (IND)\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostic (IVD)\n\nMedical Countermeasure (MCM)\n\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\nOffice of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET)\n\nPandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA)\n\nPoints of Dispensing (PODs)\n\nPublic Health Service (PHS) Act\n\nPublic Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act\n\nRisk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)\n\nSafety Information and Adverse Event Reporting System (MedWatch)\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services (HHS Secretary or Secretary of HHS)\n\nStrategic National Stockpile (SNS)\n\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\n\nAppendix A.
