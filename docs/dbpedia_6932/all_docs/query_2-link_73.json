        "text": "All properties within the City of San Diego have zoning designations reflecting the current designations in the Land Development Code.\n\nNeed to look up your Zoning Use Designation to obtain a City San Diego Business Tax Certificate?\n\nYou will be required to self-certify that your proposal is allowed in the zone that applies to the property where the business activity will be conducted. You may use the following online resources to perform self-certification:\n\nStep 1\n\nVerify the base zone designation of your business’s location by visiting ZAPP.\n\nStep 2\n\nVerify that the land use and development regulations are permitted by searching the use and development regulations tables within each section below.\n\nSDMC Chapter 13 - Zones\n\nOpen Space Base Zones (OP, OC, OF, OS)\n\nAgricultural Base Zones (AG, AR)\n\nResidential Base Zones (RE, RS, RX, RT, RM)\n\nCommercial Base Zones (CN, CR, CO, CV, CP, CC)\n\nIndustrial Base Zones (IP, IL, IH, IS, IBT)\n\nMixed-Use Base Zones (RMX, EMX)\n\nPlanned District Ordinance Zones (Zones not listed above)\n\nOverlay zones and other site criteria are used to determine if additional regulations, approvals or permits are required. For example, a site in a Specific Plan or Community Plan Implementation Overlay zone may have different or additional requirements than the base zone. A project located within the Coastal Overlay Zone may require approval of a Coastal Development Permit prior to issuance of any construction permit. A site within any environmentally sensitive lands layers would require additional information to be submitted with any permit application in order for staff to confirm the presence of environmentally sensitive lands that could require a Site Development Permit or Neighborhood Development Permit.\n\nParking Impact Overlay Zone: This overlay zone provides supplemental parking regulations for specified coastal beach and campus areas that have parking impacts per San Diego Municipal Code §132.0801.\n\nAnnual Holiday Construction Restriction: Each year, during the peak holiday shopping season, between Thanksgiving Day and New Year's Day, construction-related activities on streets adjacent to major retail shopping areas."
