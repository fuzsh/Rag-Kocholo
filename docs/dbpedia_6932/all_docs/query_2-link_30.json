        "text": "Overview\n\nUK conformity assessment (UKCA) marking is used on products placed on the market in Great Britain (GB). It shows that products comply with requirements in legislation applying in GB.\n\nThis page applies to the following areas:\n\ntoys\n\npyrotechnics\n\nrecreational craft and personal watercraft\n\nsimple pressure vessels\n\nelectromagnetic compatibility\n\nnon-automatic weighing instruments\n\nmeasuring instruments\n\nmeasuring container bottles\n\nlifts\n\nequipment for potentially explosive atmospheres (UKEX)\n\nradio equipment\n\npressure equipment\n\npersonal protective equipment (PPE)\n\ngas appliances\n\nmachinery\n\nequipment for use outdoors\n\naerosol dispensers\n\nlow voltage electrical equipment\n\nYou can find information on these regulations on our using the UKCA marking guidance page.\n\nYou will still need to take action to ensure you comply with importer responsibilities if you are placing a product on the GB market from outside the UK.\n\nCheck which rules apply\n\nWhat you need to do depends on the type of goods you are placing on the GB market. You must make sure that your products meet GB rules. You will need to do this even if they were previously sold in an EU country.\n\nMost of this page covers goods subject to the UKCA or CE marking.\n\nThere are different rules for products regulated under other regulatory frameworks, such as:\n\nchemicals\n\nmedicines\n\nveterinary medicines\n\nvehicles\n\naerospace\n\nThere are also specific rules for other products, such as:\n\nmedical devices\n\nconstruction products\n\nmarine equipment\n\nrail products\n\ncableways\n\ntransportable pressure equipment\n\nunmanned aircraft systems\n\nhazardous substances (RoHS)\n\necodesign\n\ncivil explosives\n\ncosmetics\n\ntobacco products\n\nfertilisers\n\nRead more about which regulations apply to your products and how to comply with them. For some products, you must comply with more than one set of regulations.\n\nYou can speak to your solicitor or trade association if you are unsure which regulations apply to your products.\n\nPlacing products on the market\n\nA product is placed on the market when it is first made available for distribution, consumption or use on the GB market as part of a commercial activity. This can be in return for payment or free of charge.\n\nThis happens after a product has been fully manufactured. A product is placed on the market when an offer or agreement is made for the transfer of ownership, possession or any other property right. Placing on the market can take place before the physical transfer of a product. It does not necessarily require the physical handover of a product.\n\nProof that a product has been placed on the market includes documents typically used in business transactions, for example:\n\ncontracts of sale for goods\n\ninvoices\n\nshipping documents for goods\n\n‘Placing a product on the market’ refers to individual products and not a type of product.\n\nExample of a GB-based manufacturer placing a product on the market\n\nA GB-based toy manufacturer contracts to supply fully manufactured toys to a shop in GB on 1 January 2023. This agreement constitutes placing the toys on the GB market on 1 January 2023, even if the toys are physically delivered after that.\n\nExample of an overseas manufacturer placing a product on the market\n\nAn overseas electronics manufacturer contracts to sell individually identifiable and fully manufactured products to an end user (a consumer, for example) who is resident in GB. This constitutes placing on the GB market.\n\nCirculation of products on the GB market\n\nIf you placed products on either the GB or EU market using the CE marking before 11pm on 31 December 2020, these products can continue to circulate on either market until they reach their end user.\n\nThe relevant economic operator (whether manufacturer, authorised representative, importer or distributor) must provide proof, if requested, to show that the product was placed on the market before 11pm on 31 December 2020.\n\nFind out more about economic operators and their responsibilities.\n\nProducts sold online\n\nFully manufactured products are considered placed on the GB market if all of the following are true:\n\nan offer is made for the transfer of ownership, possession or any other property right in the product online\n\nthe offer is targeted at GB end users\n\nThe location of the products is not decisive; placing on the market can take place before you physically transfer them to the GB market.\n\nTransactions between economic operators established outside of the UK do not constitute placing on the GB market where the product is not destined for the GB market.\n\nProducts imported for further manufacture and components\n\nWhen products are imported into GB for further manufacture or processing, they are not considered placed on the market. Only fully manufactured products can be considered placed on the market. Under these circumstances, the GB manufacturer of the finished product has the sole and ultimate responsibility for ensuring it is compliant before placing it on the GB market.\n\nA finished product must be compliant with all applicable legislation when placed on the GB market. Components may be placed on the market separately and can constitute a fully manufactured product in their own right. This may include a requirement for the components of the product to be individually conformity assessed and marked.\n\nManufacturers should check product-specific legislation for further details. See the guidance on spare parts.\n\nHowever, for many products, a single marking covering the overall product is sufficient. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to check the conformity assessment requirements for their product and the components within them.\n\nIf you sell components separately that were once part of an assembly or installation, you must make sure they continue to meet the requirements in place when they were first placed on the GB market as part of an assembly or installation.\n\nIf the components required CE marking at the time they were first placed on the GB market, then the person selling the components must check they are currently CE marked. They must also check they are properly labelled and accompanied by the required documents.\n\nIf the person selling the components has reason to believe they do not meet the requirements (including any essential safety requirements), they must not make them available.\n\nPartly completed machinery\n\nThere are specific provisions on ‘partly completed machinery’. Partly completed machinery is covered by the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008.\n\nPlease see the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 2008 for more information.\n\nSpare parts\n\nProducts which are repaired, refurbished or exchanged without changing their original performance, purpose or type, are not considered ‘new’ and therefore do not need to be recertified and remarked.\n\nThis includes if the product is temporarily exported for repair (as the product is not being placed on the GB market for the first time when re-imported).\n\nRepair, replacement and maintenance operations are often carried out using other products which are spare parts. Spare parts are considered to have been placed on the market at the time at which the original product or system they are ultimately intended to repair, replace or maintain was placed on the market.\n\nThis means that spare parts can comply with the same conformity assessment requirements that were in place at the time the original product or system they are ultimately intended to repair, replace or maintain was placed on the market.\n\nThe definition of a spare part will vary depending on the commercial context, but it is broadly determined by a product’s ultimate intended usage. Whether a product is ultimately intended to be used as a spare part should be evidenced by any document demonstrating this intended use, which should be produced when requested by market surveillance authorities.\n\nIf the product has been subject to important changes, substantially changing its original performance, purpose, or type, it will be considered as a ‘new’ product. Therefore, the modified product must comply with GB regulatory requirements at the time the product is first placed on the market or put into service.\n\nThis guidance is intended to sit alongside existing provisions for spare parts in the regulations and continues established practice in GB.\n\nPrototypes and testing\n\nPrototypes which are not yet made available for distribution, consumption or use on the GB market do not require UKCA marking. However, the prototype must only be displayed or demonstrated under controlled conditions at trade fairs or exhibitions in GB.\n\nThis means the product needs to be operated by experts, there must be restricted public contact with the product, the product must not interact inappropriately with other neighbouring products, and it must be clearly indicated on a sign that the product does not meet the GB requirements and will not be made available until it does.\n\nProducts undergoing testing or validating pre-production of units do not require UKCA marking. They are still considered to be in the stage of manufacture and therefore have not been placed on the GB market.\n\nHowever, fully manufactured products intended for consumer testing need to meet the UK requirements as they apply in GB at the time the consumer testing takes place.\n\nLeasing and hiring\n\nTransfer of ownership, possession, or any property right of an individual product is considered to have taken place in the circumstances of a sale, a loan, hiring and leasing.\n\nThe repeated leasing, loaning and hiring of a product constitutes further ‘making available’ and therefore does not require re-marking. However, before every leasing, loaning or hiring, the person leasing out, loaning out or hiring out the product will need to check that the requirements are still met.\n\nThe date a product is placed on the market can be demonstrated by any document ordinarily used in business transactions, for example a contract of sale or invoice which details the serial number of the product.\n\nSecond-hand products\n\nIn most cases, second-hand goods are treated in the same way as new goods when placed on the market in Great Britain. If second-hand products are further made available, they must meet the requirements that were in place when they were first placed on the market, unless there is specific provision to the contrary. If second-hand goods have been substantially modified, there may be a need for re-assessment and remarking.\n\nUKCA in other territories\n\nThe UKCA marking does not apply in the Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey.\n\nThe UKCA marking does not apply in the British Overseas Territories.\n\nYou should check requirements with the relevant governing authorities."
