        "text": "Future Miele appliances will benefit from faster and easier pairing thanks to automatic appliance recognition via a new QR code scan technique and further technical improvements. These enhancements will become standard for all future connectable Miele appliances with compatible Wi-Fi modules, with many 125 Gala Edition models being the first to enjoy them.\n\nMiele app version 4.12.0 introduces support for Bluetooth when connecting Miele appliances to the home Wi-Fi network, offering a new pairing option available with future Miele appliances that have Bluetooth built in.\n\nImproved User Consent: We have resolved an issue where users were repeatedly asked to confirm consent for newsletters and error image reporting.\n\nDelay Start Time Fix (Android 14): A wrong time was displayed on Android 14 devices after setting a delay start time for a chosen programme. The app now accurately displays and sets the delayed start time for appliances with a delay start function.\n\nImproved Appliance Display: Since the last app release, users can also add their non-connectable appliances to the Miele app. We have resolved an issue where the Miele app did not correctly identify and display these appliances on the dashboard. An exception is still Miele's ironing appliances.\n\nWarranty Date Fix: You can now set accurate purchase dates for all your appliances in the Warranty section (pre-2020 dates are now allowed).\n\nCM7 Coffee Machines Fixes: Improved user experience with consumable alerts and enhanced app stability."
