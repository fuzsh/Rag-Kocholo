        "text": "If you are a coffee lover, you must read this. ☕️❤️ Do you love black coffee? Add some (plant) milk or sugar? Maybe your favorite is even a latte macchiato – or a flat white. Iced coffee in the summer? How about we try something new! Something deliciously smooth with rich flavors that is perfect for warm summer days. ☀️ Cold Brew, Cold Brew Macchiato and Slow Brew are the perfect additions to summery me-moments. Sounds like a lengthy and complex preparation process? Not even close! With the updated EQ700 fully automatic espresso machine, all it needs is a tap on the touch screen – and 3.5 minutes waiting time. Baristas use cold water and a long extraction time to prepare Cold Brew coffee. Slow Brew coffee uses hot water and a similarly extended contact time with the ground coffee. Both methods help fully extract all flavors, resulting in a rich, full-bodied cup of coffee. Technological improvements in the EQ700’s iAroma system now allow for slow and intermittent water pumping through the coffee grounds. This enhances the extraction process and ensures the coffee’s aroma develops fully. How do you prefer your coffee?

At BSH, our Global Graduate Accelerator stands out as a distinctive pathway for recent Graduates to launch their careers.

The developments in this area are impressive and kitchen appliances are also becoming increasingly intelligent. Our #Siemens ovens in the iQ700 series with a camera have the AI-powered Individual Browning feature. Users can determine how crispy they like their food on a scale of 1-5. With the help of the camera and AI, the ovens monitor the preparation and switch off automatically as soon as the desired degree of browning is reached. Anyone who is already using the oven with Individual Browning can look forward to a great update: from now on, after a simple software update, the appliances will recognise which food is in the oven thanks to the Food Recognition feature and automatically make the appropriate settings. How does it work? Using a built-in camera and AI, the oven can recognise 40 different dishes, such as pizza or lasagna. It then suggests the appropriate settings and users just have to give their “ok”. The appliance takes over the preparation and automatically switches to the grill function, for example, if the preparation requires it. So, you can devote your time to other things until the food is ready. 🍽️ #BSH #ConsumerCentricity #HomeAppliances #AI\n\nWho makes you smile at work?

Bosch México Thermador Home Connect\n\nWhat do our colleagues say about their work at BSH? To offer an insight into the working world of our design teams, today we are putting Sonja Schiefer, Head of Design at #Siemens Home Appliances, in the spotlight. She describes what makes her work so special, what trends she is currently focusing on and when design can offer real benefit: 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗮 𝗴𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂? The answer to this question has definitely changed over time. In the current situation of society and the environment, it is essential to use design to create real benefit and fulfill needs. In the case of BSH, good design makes innovative solutions accessible and enriches people's lives in their own homes. 𝗪𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝗯𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀? At Siemens Home Appliances, we express the intelligence and progressiveness of our appliances through exceptional design. At the same time, we make the technology understandable and set new standards, for example with the Siemens Intelligent Kitchen. The trend towards intelligent home appliances is constantly growing. Our designs are the connecting element in offering consumers individual benefits. 𝗪𝗵𝗶𝗰𝗵 𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗮𝘁 𝗦𝗶𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘀? The kitchen of the future is individually adapted to its users. In addition to connectivity and artificial intelligence, this also includes personalization options and, of course, sustainable aspects. Connected home appliances are already contributing to greater sustainability, for example by allowing users to view and customize their electricity and water consumption. For us, the key lies in understanding the changing expectations of consumers and using design to shape innovations into appealing experiences.\n\nWe guess we can agree: We want our laundry clean and in the most efficient way possible.
