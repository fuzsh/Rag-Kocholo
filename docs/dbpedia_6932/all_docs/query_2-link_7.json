        "text": "On this page\n\nAbout consumer rights\n\nConsumers have the right to expect certain things\n\nConsumers have the right to expect certain things when they buy a product or service. In consumer law, these basic rights are called consumer guarantees.\n\nThese rights are protected under consumer law.\n\nBusinesses can’t take away a consumer's rights\n\nThe basic rights covered by consumer guarantees can’t be taken away by anything a business says or does.\n\nFor example, a business can’t take away these basic rights by:\n\ndisplaying a ‘no refunds’ sign, or otherwise saying that refunds are not available at all, or not available at all after a certain number of days\n\nsaying they aren’t responsible for problems with a product or service\n\nsuggesting the consumer must sign an extended warranty to avoid losing these basic rights after a certain date.\n\nIt is against the law for businesses to mislead consumers about their rights in these ways.\n\nConsumer rights are different to warranties\n\nConsumer guarantees are not the same as warranties, including extended warranties.\n\nConsumer guarantees are automatic and can’t be taken away. Warranties are extra promises that a business can choose to make on top of the consumer guarantees.\n\nSee Warranties for more information.\n\nWhen these consumer rights apply\n\nPersonal or household use\n\nProducts and services that are normally bought for personal or household use are covered by consumer guarantees.\n\nBusiness use\n\nA business can be a consumer too. A product or service bought for business use is covered by consumer guarantees, when it meets at least one of the following conditions:\n\nit costs less than $100,000 including GST\n\nit is a product or service commonly bought for personal, domestic or household use\n\nthe good is a vehicle or trailer that is used mainly to transport goods on public roads.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions. Even when meeting one of these conditions, a product is not covered by consumer guarantees when it's purchased:\n\nfor resupply\n\nfor use or transformation in production or manufacturing, or\n\nto repair or treat other goods.\n\nExample of when consumer guarantees apply\n\nA dental practice buys a portable air conditioner for use in the practice for $500.\n\nThe air conditioner is less than $100,000 and is not being re-sold by the practice or being used up in the course of the practice’s business. So it is covered by the consumer guarantees.\n\nExample of when consumer guarantees don't apply\n\nA farmer buys grain from a supplier to feed the cattle on his small farm. The shipment of grain costs $20,000. He will then sell the cattle once it reaches a certain age.\n\nWhile the grain costs less than $100,000, it is being used in the production of the farmer’s cattle and so it's not covered by the consumer guarantees.\n\nGifts\n\nConsumers who receive a product or service as a gift are entitled to the same basic rights as if they had bought the product or service themselves.\n\nExceptions and special rules\n\nThere are some exceptions and special rules where consumer guarantees don’t apply to certain types of goods and services, or apply in a different way, or different laws apply:\n\nhiring or leasing a product\n\nbundled products and services\n\nprivate sales, where the seller isn’t running a business\n\nauctions\n\nproducts from overseas businesses\n\nproducts and services bought before 2011\n\nfinancial products\n\nservices to transport or store business goods\n\nengineering and architect services.\n\nRead more about the exceptions and special rules.\n\nProducts and the consumer rights that apply\n\nWhen buying a product, a consumer has the right to expect the following things.\n\nA product sold to a consumer must be of acceptable quality.\n\nAcceptable quality means the product:\n\nis safe, durable and free from defects\n\nhas an acceptable appearance and finish\n\ndoes everything that similar products are commonly used for.\n\nThere are no set rules for deciding whether a product is of acceptable quality, or how long a product should last for. To decide whether a product meets this expectation, consider questions like:\n\nWhat kind of product is it, and how does it compare to similar products?\n\nWhat is it made of and how was it made, and how does this compare to similar products?\n\nHow much did it cost, and how does it compare to products of a similar price?\n\nWhat maintenance may be needed to keep the product operating?\n\nDid the business or manufacturer make any claims about quality, or how long the product could last for?\n\nDid the business warn the consumer about any defects, or warn against the product’s use in a certain manner?\n\nHow old is the product, and how long do similar products normally last?\n\nWas the product sold new or second-hand?\n\nHas the product been used in a way it wasn’t designed for?\n\nFor more information and help in deciding whether a product may meet the ‘durable’ or ‘safe’ parts of the consumer guarantee of acceptable quality, the following guides explain these things in more detail, including examples.\n\nGuidance on the consumer guarantee as to acceptable quality and ‘durability’\n\nGuidance on the consumer guarantee as to acceptable quality and ‘safe’\n\nExample\n\nA consumer buys a new pair of shoes. One of the shoes loses a heel when it's worn for the first time.\n\nThe consumer can claim that the shoe doesn’t meet the guarantee of acceptable quality.\n\nThis guarantee applies when:\n\na consumer tells a business they want to use a product for a particular purpose\n\nthe consumer buys the product based on the advice of the business\n\nthe business advertises in any way that the product can be used for a particular purpose.\n\nIn any of these situations, the product that the business sells must be fit for the particular purpose stated.\n\nThis guarantee does not apply:\n\nif it’s unreasonable for the consumer to rely on the skill or judgement of the business\n\nif the business tells the consumer the product won’t meet their purpose, but the consumer buys the product anyway.\n\nExample\n\nA consumer buys paint from a specialty paint shop after explaining to the business that they’re painting their outdoor decking. After a couple of months, the paint begins to peel, as it’s unsuitable for outdoor surfaces.\n\nThe consumer can claim that the paint isn’t fit for a particular purpose that was made known to the business.\n\nAny description of a product by a business must be accurate, whether written or spoken.\n\nExample\n\nA consumer orders a set of pink towels online based on the colour chart supplied by the business. The towels delivered are red.\n\nThe consumer can claim that the towels don’t match the description by the business.\n\nIf a consumer buys a product based on a sample or demonstration model, the product must have the same quality and features.\n\nExample\n\nA courier test rides a new motorcycle for their business. They agree to buy a motorcycle the same as the demonstration model. When the new motorcycle is delivered, it has a smaller engine than the demonstration model.\n\nThe courier can claim the motorcycle doesn’t match the demonstration model.\n\nIf a business or manufacturer makes extra promises about the quality, condition, performance or characteristics of a product, they must meet these promises. This applies whether the promises are spoken or written.\n\nThese extra promises are legally known as express warranties.\n\nExample\n\nA consumer buys a kitchen knife. The business promises that it will stay sharp for 10 years. After 5 years, the knife is no longer sharp.\n\nThe consumer can claim that the knife doesn’t meet the express warranty.\n\nThese 3 consumer guarantees are closely related. When a consumer buys a product, they have a right to expect that:\n\nthey have full ownership of the product\n\nnobody will try to reclaim or repossess the product\n\nthe previous owner doesn’t owe money for the product.\n\nIf any of these aren’t true, the business must tell the consumer before they buy the product.\n\nNDIS participants\n\nIf you have concerns about overcharging, visit NDIS Commission fair pricing for more information about reporting the issue.\n\nWe encourage you to report the conduct to the ACCC when you have concerns your consumer guarantees have not been met when buying a product, you've been misled by a provider, or there are unfair contract terms in your contract.\n\nServices and the consumer rights that apply\n\nWhen buying a service, a consumer has the right to expect the following things.\n\nService providers must carry out all services using an acceptable level of care and skill. Their work must be at least as good as what a competent service provider with average skills and experience would provide. They must also take reasonable steps to avoid causing loss or damage when providing the service.\n\nExample\n\nA consumer hires a plumber to fix a leak in the bathroom. The next day, the same leak returns.\n\nThe consumer can claim that the service wasn’t provided with due care and skill.\n\nServices provided, and any resulting products, must be fit for any stated purpose.\n\nThis guarantee applies when:\n\na consumer tells a service provider they want to use their service for a particular purpose\n\nthe consumer buys the service based on the advice of the business\n\nthe service provider advertises that their service can be used for a particular purpose.\n\nThis guarantee doesn’t apply to professional services provided by a qualified architect or engineer.\n\nExample\n\nA consumer hires a carpenter to build a unit that will fit their 50-inch television. The finished product is too small.\n\nThe consumer can claim that the service didn’t meet the purpose specified.\n\nServices must be supplied within a reasonable time, if there’s no agreed time frame.\n\nWhat is 'reasonable' can depend on factors including:\n\nthe nature of the services\n\nweather conditions\n\navailability of parts or materials.\n\nExample\n\nA consumer hires a builder to repair an outdoor patio. The consumer and the builder don't discuss the completion date. The builder starts the repairs but doesn’t return for a month.\n\nThe consumer can claim that the service hasn’t been supplied within a reasonable time.\n\nHowever, if it was raining during that time, the delay might be reasonable.\n\nNDIS participants\n\nIf you have concerns about overcharging, visit NDIS Commission fair pricing for more information about reporting the issue.\n\nWe encourage you to report the conduct to the ACCC when you have concerns your consumer guarantees have not been met when buying a service, you've been misled by a provider, or there are unfair contract terms in your contract.\n\nExceptions and special rules\n\nHiring or leasing\n\nMost of the consumer guarantees apply when a consumer hires or leases a product, rather than buying it outright.\n\nHowever, consumers don’t own products they hire or lease, so the consumer guarantees related to ownership (title to the product and no hidden debts or charges) do not apply to hiring or leasing products.\n\nThe consumer guarantee of undisturbed possession does apply, but only for the length of the hire or lease agreement.\n\nBundled products and services\n\nBusinesses sometimes sell products and services together as a package, for example a mobile phone on a service contract. Sometimes a problem may only be with the product or service part of the package.\n\nThere are rules for how returning the product part of the package affects the service part of the package, and for how cancelling the service affects your rights to the product. Read these guides for more information.\n\nPrivate sales\n\nMost consumer guarantees don’t apply to one-off sales between 2 people, where the seller isn’t running a business. Examples include sales at a garage sale or fete, or individuals selling through online marketplaces like Gumtree or Facebook Marketplace.\n\nHowever, the following consumer guarantees do apply to these private sales:\n\ntitle to the product\n\nundisturbed possession\n\nno hidden debts or charges.\n\nAuctions\n\nMost consumer guarantees don’t apply to products sold at a traditional auction – that is, an auction run by an agent of the person selling the goods.\n\nHowever, the following consumer guarantees do apply to traditional auctions:\n\ntitle to the product\n\nundisturbed possession\n\nno hidden debts or charges.\n\nThe law against false or misleading claims also applies to traditional auctions.\n\nFor online auctions, see Buying and selling online for more information.\n\nProducts from overseas businesses\n\nWhen an overseas business sells products directly to consumers in Australia, the business must follow the Australian Consumer Law, including the consumer guarantees.\n\nIn practice it can be difficult to get a repair, replacement or refund from an overseas business if there’s a problem with the product or service, and the help Australian consumer protection agencies can provide is limited.\n\nIf you can’t resolve a problem with an overseas business, you should ask the consumer protection agency where the seller is based if it can help you.\n\nConsumers aren’t covered by the Australian Consumer Law if the business doesn’t officially offer their products and services in Australia. For example, if the consumer has the business send the product to an overseas address, and the consumer then arranges for someone else to forward or bring the product to Australia.\n\nProducts and services bought before 2011\n\nProducts and services bought before 1 January 2011 aren’t covered by the current Australian Consumer Law. They may be covered by older laws.\n\nIf you have a problem with a product bought before 1 January 2011, read Warranties and refunds guide. This guide is relevant to goods and services bought before 1 January 2011, when the current law was introduced.\n\nFinancial products\n\nConsumer guarantees in the Australian Consumer Law don’t apply to financial products such as insurance, as these are covered by other laws.\n\nServices to transport or store business goods\n\nServices to transport or store goods for business purposes are not covered by consumer guarantees.\n\nEngineering and architect services\n\nThe fit for purpose consumer guarantee doesn’t apply to professional services provided by a qualified architect or engineer.\n\nGuides on consumer guarantees\n\nRead our guides for consumers and for business and legal practitioners.\n\nThe guide covers what consumer guarantees apply to goods and services, who is responsible for these guarantees and when remedies, such as refund repair and replacement are available.\n\nIn this booklet you will find answers to some of the questions most commonly asked by consumers.\n\nNext steps for business\n\nIf you need more help about the rules for consumer guarantees\n\nContact us for information about your rights and obligations under the law or seek legal advice.\n\nContact the ACCC\n\nIf you believe you’ve been misled about your consumer guarantee rights by another business\n\nYour first step is to contact the other business to explain the problem.\n\nIf the business doesn’t resolve the problem, there are more steps you can take.\n\nGet help contacting another business or taking a problem further"
