Our team of experienced appliance experts have answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about home appliance repair.\n\nIs It Better To Repair or Replace an Appliance?\n\nFirst, call a professional for help determining whether it’s worth fixing an older appliance. The decision to repair or replace an appliance will vary based on how well the appliance was maintained, what the issue is, and how old the appliance is. An experienced appliance service professional will weigh all those factors to help you determine if repairing or replacing your appliance is the best option.\n\nIs It Worth Fixing Old Appliances?\n\nDetermining if it’s worth fixing an old appliance is not always an easy decision because every repair case is different. While you don’t want to waste time and money repairing an old appliance that could potentially break down again quickly, extending its life until you can afford a newer model may be worth it (depending on the cost and nature of the repair). Before initiating any repairs, a professional should provide you with upfront pricing related to the repair, which will help you make an informed decision. Your local Mr. Appliance provides upfront pricing and the Neighborly Done Right Promise™, which ensures your satisfaction.\n\nWhat Is the Life Expectancy of a Home Appliance?\n\nLife expectancy for a home appliance varies depending on usage, maintenance, and more. Refer to the chart below for average home appliance life expectancies.\n\nReliable Home Appliance Repair Services From the Experts\n\nKeeping your household running smoothly means keeping your kitchen and laundry room appliances in top shape. It’s hard to make dinner when the stove doesn’t turn on, and it’s disturbing how fast laundry piles up when the washing machine or dryer is on the fritz."
