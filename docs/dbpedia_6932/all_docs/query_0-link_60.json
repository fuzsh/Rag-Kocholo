        "text": "2.1. Method description\n\nIn a first step of the Consumer Footprint approach, the BoP appliances of a so-called “baseline scenario” is specified. The objective of this baseline scenario is to assess the impacts associated to the consumption of household appliances in Europe, covered by the Ecodesign directive (European Union, 2009), in the reference year 2010, by an average European citizen. Three main types of household appliances are taken into account for this BoP: (i) white goods, (ii) appliances for basic functions related to housing (e.g. space cooling), and (iii) entertainment and leisure. In parallel to this general principle, the selection of products categories has taken into account that the final goal of the project was to assess the impacts from an average European citizen considering the all five mentioned key areas (Sala and Castellani, 2019),Thus, in order to avoid potential double counting, appliances fully covered in any of the former Consumer Footprint studies are not included again here. This is the case of the heating infrastructure which is fully represented in the study about housing.\n\nAs reference flow, the “amount of household appliances consumed by an average EU-271 citizen and their use in the reference year 2010″ is used.\n\nThe executed calculations cover the entire life cycle of the various household appliances being part of the BoP – starting from the extraction of the various materials, up to the recycling and end-of-life options at the end of the lifetime of the various household appliances. This baseline scenario for the year 2010 allows for identifying the environmental hotspots along the entire lifecycle of these devices (i.e. allowing to identify which actor could influence how much these impacts), but also within the examined BoP appliances (i.e. allowing to identify the environmental relevance of the various household appliances included in this basket).\n\nFor the second step, the results of this hotspot analysis of the baseline scenario are then used as starting point for the selection of possible actions in order to reduce the environmental burdens – i.e. in order to define what is called in the on-hand manuscript the various “future scenarios”. For this, the study examined the environmental implications of a number of different eco-innovations applied to the household appliances system in the year 2030, covering the implementation of eco-solutions on a technical level, changes in consumption pattern, behavioral changes, as well as the combination of all these aspects. In practice, this has been translated into a thorough literature review in order to identify the different areas of (potential) improvement and their related eco-innovation aspects. Guiding principles for the choice of these future scenarios have been the following three aspects: (i) the most relevant environmental hotspots identified in the baseline, (ii) effects due to European policies, and (iii) innovations that at present are a niche, but are foreseen to become relevant in the future. Overall, the objective of this second step is the identification of the potential environmental benefits associated to each of these examined actions as well as to unveil possible trade-offs, e.g. due to the reduction of impacts in one impact category (e.g. climate change) while increasing impacts in another one (e.g. ecotoxicity).\n\nAll the LCA calculations in the frame of this study have been executed with the software tool SimaPro 8, using data from ecoinvent version 3.2 (ecoinventCentre, 2015) in the background and applying the Environmental Footprint (EF) method (European Commission, 2018), in the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) step in order to get a comprehensive overview of the resulting environmental impacts. The method builds upon the list of recommended impact factors (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2011) in EC-JRC’s ILCD (International Reference Life Cycle Data System) handbook, updating these recommendations for a number of impact categories, namely: water use, land use, particulate matter, resource use, and the toxicity-related ones (ecotoxicity, human toxicity cancer and non-cancer). The here applied characterisation factors refers to the EF package 3.0 (EF 3.0) (European Commission - Joint Research Centre, 2019), and an overview of them is reported in Fazio et al., (2018).\n\n2.3. Life cycle inventory data\n\nLife cycle inventory (LCI) data for the representative products (for the baseline scenario 2010) of these different product categories have been gathered for their entire life cycle – starting from the extraction of the required raw materials, up to the end-of-life treatment (i.e. recycling, disposal) of the used product. A detailed overview of all covered processes and activities along all life cycle stages is given in .\n\nTable 3\n\nCovered Life Cycle StagesIncluded Activities/ProcessesManufacturing components\n\n•\n\nProduction of raw materials\n\n•\n\nProcessing of raw materials\n\n•\n\nTransport of components to factory where manufacturing takes place\n\nManufacturing of product\n\n•\n\nAssembly of components\n\nPackaging\n\n•\n\nManufacture packaging\n\n•\n\nTransport of packaging to factory\n\n•\n\nFinal disposal packaging (landfill, incineration, energy recovery, recycling)\n\nDistribution and retail\n\n•\n\nTransport packaged product from factory to Retail/Distribution Centre\n\nUse phase\n\n•\n\nTransport of product from Retail/Distribution Centre to final consumer\n\n•\n\nConsumption of energy and water from the use of the product\n\n•\n\nUse of detergents and salt, if any (detergents, salt and additives (rinse off) for Dishwashers and detergents and additives – e.g. softeners, bleaching agents, etc. - for Washing machines)\n\n•\n\nWaste management, if any (e.g. wastewater treatment of product used).\n\nMaintenance and repair\n\n•\n\nManufacturing of components to be substituted (production and processing of raw materials, transport of materials to factory)\n\n•\n\nWaste management of substituted components\n\nEoL of the product\n\n•\n\nSorting of materials/components\n\n•\n\nRecycling\n\n•\n\nIncineration and energy recovery\n\n•\n\nLandfill\n\nThe compilation of these LCI data started - whenever available - from the respective Ecodesign preparatory study (e.g. from Boyano et al., 2017b for the Dishwasher) and was completed - if necessary - with further data sources. If no such preparatory study has been available or when those data haven’t been judged as being up-to-date for the year 2010, other data sources have been used. Table S1 (in the supplementary materials) summarizes the various sources used for the LCI datasets of all here examined, representative products. More detailed information of all these inventories can be found also in Reale et al., (2019). summarizes the key elements (i.e. composition data, energy consumption, specification of maintenance and End of Life (EoL) treatment) of the modelled, representative products being part of the BoP appliances, and used for the calculation of the baseline scenario for 2010. Within these materials composition data listed in , covering the devices as well as their packaging, the category “electronics” is not modelled in a similar manner for all the examined devices; as for some of the devices this amount represents only the actual electronic components (i.e. printed wiring boards - PWBs - with the various, mounted components), while in other devices this share contains also cables, motors and further elements. For the television and the notebook, the PWBs are modelled with the respective dataset for a laptop computer, available in the background database (ecoinvent v3.2), while the PWBs of all other devices are modelled with the market dataset for unspecified, surface mounted, lead-free PWBs. In all cases, the modelling is done in a way that no materials is omitted or counted twice. More detailed information about the material compositions (including e.g. a detailed split of the packaging materials) can be found in section 1 of the supplementary materials.\n\nTable 4\n\nDishWasher 13psDishWasher 10psWashing machineTumble dryerCombined refrigerator-freezerElectric oven (BI)NotebookLCD TV screenRACCompact fluorescent lampIncandescent lampHalogen lamp low voltageHalogen lamp medium voltageLED(i) Product CompositionTotal Weight (in kg)47.841.566.742.269.628.42.110.944.80.060.030.030.020.15Plastics22.7%20.3%17.7%32.0%34.0%2.3%21.6%47.6%18.0%23.0%5.2%––19.7%Glass––2.8%4.4%10.0%14.5%0.4%––45.3%89.2%96.9%86.1%10.7%Metals57.3%59.6%48.9%58.9%54.6%82.8%22.2%35.5%75.5%3.7%4.2%1.8%6.6%51.6%Electronics2.9%2.9%0.3%4.7%0.5%0.4%55.8%16.5%3.3%24.8%0.6%0.3%0.8%18.0%Other materials17.1%17.2%30.3%–0.8%––0.4%0.5%3.2%0.8%1.0%6.5%–Refrigerant0.1%2.7%(ii) Packaging CompositionTotal Weight (in kg)1.331.072.922.904.652.390.190.903.920.060.060.030.060.04Cardboard and paper30.5%28.4%78.1%77.0%63.29%54.8%77.0%76.9%77.0%90.0%90.0%90.0%90.0%90.0%Plastics69.5%71.6%21.9%23.0%36.71%23.0%22.9%23.0%10.0%10.0%10.0%10.0%10.0%(iii) Use characteristicsEnergy (kWh/a)398398140.4450290164522373845.624.316.416.40Water (L/a)5,1805′,18011,000–––––––––––Lifetime (a)12.512.512.51315195615122.24.43.334.2\n\nFor the manufacturing of each device, the European electricity mix2 is used for the share of production that is known to happen in Europe. For the share of production known to happen outside Europe, a specific electricity mix was created, representing the real conditions of the production sites (according to the share of imports coming from extra-EU countries). The modelling of distribution and retail again takes into account the share of products that is imported from outside Europe, modelling the related transportation efforts (i.e. means of transport and distances), based on the different exporting countries (identified in respective statistical data (Eurostat, 2017). For the share of consumed products produced in Europe, the transport is modelled according to the “local supply chain” defined within the Product Environmental Footprint Category rules (PEFCR) guidance (European Commission, 2018). The transport from distribution centre/retail to the final consumer is part of the use stage. A transport for 250 km by VAN, Euro 3 is considered for all products.\n\n3.2. Future scenarios\n\nAn overview of the reduction potential of the various tested scenarios is listed in . Hereinafter, there are the details of the results of each scenario.\n\nUse of a more renewable electricity mix (Scenario 1). This first scenario is taking up the main issue from the analysis of the baseline, i.e. the use phase being the most relevant lifecycle stage among almost all impact categories. There, one issue is clearly dominating: the electricity consumption. With a first scenario, the influence of a change of the electricity mix towards a more sustainable mix on the overall results is investigated. For this, the forecasted mix of gross electricity generation by source in the year 2030 from the report “EU Reference Scenario 2016 – Energy, transport and GHG emissions Trends to 2050\" (European Commission, 2016) is used here in order to model the future, more renewable European electricity mix for the year 2030. More detailed information how these statistical data have been translated into an LCA dataset in the frame of this study here can be found in section 2.1 of the supporting materials. This (future) electricity mix has then been applied on the use phase of the original BoP and summarizes the resulting impacts, taking as reference (set to 100%) the impacts from the 2010 baseline scenario.\n\nAll changes (i.e. deviations from 100%) in this figure are caused by the use phase, as this is the only element that has been modified. The resulting pattern shows that such a more renewable electricity mix is not automatically resulting in lower emissions and thus impacts. While there are some categories that show a considerable reduction (e.g. AP with more than 40% reduction), two categories (e.g. ODP and MRD) show almost no changes, and there is even one category (LUC) with increasing results. In the area of global warming, the application of this more renewable electricity mix leads to a reduction of almost one quarter of the respective impact, with the use phase remaining by far the most relevant contributor to GWP.\n\nUse of more efficient and less harmful devices (Scenario 2 to 8). In a second step, several scenarios that are dealing with making the actual service that the client gets from these devices more efficient and less harmful have been analysed. above summarizes the cornerstones of these scenarios towards more efficient and less harmful devices for the six product categories showing the highest contribution in the baseline scenario (i.e. dishwasher, washing machine, refrigerator, television, lighting and air conditioner). Calculating these various scenarios results in the in shown reduction potential for each of these product categories – with 100% representing the baseline result of the respective category.\n\nThe highest reduction potentials could be observed for the category ODP in case of air conditioners – the change of the cooling substance together with a lower leakage rate can result in a reduction potential bigger than a factor of 20. For GWP, these changes result also in a reduction of the impacts in the order of 20%, while all other categories show hardly any changes in case of the air conditioners.\n\nFrom the remaining five categories, lighting shows clearly the highest reduction potential – ranging from about 75% (e.g. for ODP or IRP) to at least 33% (for FEP and FETP, respectively). In the same time, lighting is also the only category that shows an impact that increases (MRD) to almost twice the value from the baseline scenario; being the result from the technology change (towards LED – consuming much more high-impacting resources). The reduction for all other categories is the result mainly from the considerable reduction of the energy consumption in its use by almost a factor of 7 (i.e. from 404 kWh/year down to 61 kWh/year in a single dwelling); representing the by far highest energy saving potential of all here examined product categories.\n\nFor the four remaining, bulky devices (dishwasher, washing machine, refrigerator and television), the applied efficiency measures – mainly in the area of energy consumption in the use phase – results in most of the here examined impact categories in a reduction potential of 20–40% compared to the respective baseline. Due to the change of the refrigerant (from R134a to R600a), the refrigerator shows for ODP and GWP a further reduction potential compared to the other bulky devices – leading for ODP to about 5 times less impacts than in the baseline calculation.\n\nInfluences from changes in the user behavior (Scenario 9 to 12). Within the user behavior, two different view angles have been investigated - a high-level view looking on the number of devices that each individual European citizen owns, and a more detailed, device-specific view looking on the way, how such devices are actually used. In the latter case (as listed in above), the aspects of an increasing reuse, an increasing collection and an increasing recycling rate are distinguished and analysed individually. All these aspects have however only a minor influence on the overall impacts – their reduction potential never exceeds 3%; while the first one (i.e. the reuse of devices) shows a reduction potential of 2–2.5% for all factors (except ODP), an increase of the collection and/or the recycling activities hardly influences the overall results (see also Fig. S1 in the supplementary materials).\n\nChanging the view angle towards the above mentioned, high-level view (looking on the number of devices that an individual citizen owns), leads to a considerable different result – result shown in . Here, all the examined impact categories show a more or less uniform increase of the impact in the order of 35–40% for the annual use of household appliances of an average citizen – except for ODP, where the increase is in the order of 180%. The latter is due to the expected much higher increase of air conditioners in the coming two decades (more than 3 times more such devices are expected per citizen in 2030, compared to the situation in 2010); this is thehighest increase compared to all other product categories, as can be seen from the data in Table S6 in the supplementary materials.\n\nOverall potential (combining scenarios 1 to 12). Last but not least, the overall potential, when combining all these individual ecoinnovation scenarios together, has been calculated. This calculation is established in four subsequent steps, adding up the intermediate results each time, in order to allow a more easy identification of the relevance of each type of ecoinnovation. The four individual steps distinguished in this final calculation – going from the micro up to the macro scale – are the following:\n\n•\n\n“Efficiency of the Devices” – being a first part of the micro scale and representing the total of the scenarios 2 to 8 (dealing with the use of more efficient and less harmful devices);\n\n•\n\n“Increased Usability” – being the second part of the micro scale and representing the total of the scenarios 10 to 12 (dealing with an increasing reuse, increasing collection and increasing recycling of these different devices);\n\n•\n\n“Changed Electricity Mix” – representing the meso scale with the application of the in Scenario 1 specified future, more sustainable European electricity mix for the use phase of all examined product categories;\n\n•\n\nand “Increased Amount” – representing the macro scale in this study by applying the forecasted increase of amount of household appliances per average European citizen identified within scenario 9.\n\nshows the results of this stepwise calculation of the overall potential that lays in the sum of all here examined ecoinnovation scenarios, illustrating the relative importance of interventions at the three here distinguished scales (as summarized in the list of bullet points above).\n\nThe overall potential of all the examined ecoinnovation scenarios is a mix of measures on three scales (micro – meso – macro) and it results in a significant reduction of the impact for most of the categories (with up to 67% for ODP, and still around 35% for GWP). However, two of the examined impact categories (i.e. LUC and MRD) show an overall potential that is negative – i.e. the sum of all these future scenarios together results in a higher impact compared to the impact of the 2010 baseline scenario.\n\nThe stepwise projection in shows clearly that the scenarios on “Increased Usability” influence the overall results the least; only in case of HTPnc and MRD these three scenarios lead to changes of 10% or more; in all other categories their induced changes are clearly lower. Hence, the overall reduction on the micro scale – ranging from 14% (MRD) to 77% (ODP), with an average of 39% – is mainly due to the scenarios summed in “Efficiency Devices”. This scale represents the main portion of the overall reduction potential – the two other scales (i.e. meso, macro) show a much lower impact. While the first allows for most of the impact categories a small, further reduction, ranging from less than 1% (ODP) to about 20% (AP) – with two categories (LUC and MRD) showing an increase of the impacts on this scale. The macro scale shows for all factors an increase of the impacts – ranging from 12% (ODP) to about 40% (LUC, MRD) – with an average increase on the macro scale of 22.5%. All in all, the results show that the latter scale counterbalances clearly all reduction effects coming from the lower scales."
