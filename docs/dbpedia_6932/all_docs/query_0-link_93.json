        "text": "Some electrical retailers will offer convenient removal services when you buy a replacement product, and recycle your old stuff for you. Others may allow you to drop them off in store for free for recycling. Search their website FAQs or ask customer services for more information on the company’s removal and recycling schemes when you place your order.\n\nElectrical household appliances should not be disposed of with your general household waste. These electricals can contain hazardous substances which can damage the environment, wildlife and our own health.\n\nThe easiest way to find your local recycling points is to check our recycling locator. Some local councils offer a recycling collection service from your door. Or for a small fee, you can arrange a bulky waste collection to take away large electricals. All local councils have one or more household waste recycling centres where you can drop off your old electricals for recycling.\n\nRepairing electrical appliances keeps valuable metals out of the waste stream for longer. Start by contacting the product manufacturer, or an authorised repairer for that make of electrical. Some areas also have repair cafes where you can either get the item repaired or learn how to fix it yourself. We have over 250 repair locations listed on our locator. Visit the recycling locator to find your local drop-off point.\n\nIf the appliance is really out of date or seriously damaged, repair may be uneconomical or impossible. But don’t throw it away. Please take it to your nearest recycling point – use our recycling locator."
