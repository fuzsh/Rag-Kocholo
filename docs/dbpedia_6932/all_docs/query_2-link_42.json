        "text": "What is a reseller permit?\n\nReseller permits are distributed by the State and allow:\n\nRetailers and wholesalers to purchase items for resale without paying sales tax.\n\nManufacturers to purchase ingredients or components that are used to create a new article for sale without paying sales tax.\n\nIn order to receive a resellers permit, you must have the appropriate:\n\nBusiness licenses in Washington.\n\nEndorsements.\n\nLabor and Industries contractor’s license (if applicable).\n\nReseller permits are generally valid for four years. However, permits are valid for only two years if any of the following apply:\n\nYou are a contractor.\n\nYour business has been open for less than 12 months.\n\nYour business has not reported gross income in the last 12 months.\n\nYour business was on active non-reporting status at the time the application was received.\n\nYour business has failed to file tax returns any time during the last 12 months.\n\nExpiration notice: If your business’s permit will not be automatically renewed, you will receive a notice to apply for a new reseller permit approximately 90 days before your permit expires.\n\nKey things to know about reseller permits:\n\nPermit numbers: Are unique to each business. The last two digits of the permit number are the year it expires.\n\nEffective dates: Are listed in the upper-right corner.\n\nBuyers using a reseller permit: Misuse of a permit may result in penalties for the buyer and the permit may be revoked. Anyone found using a permit inappropriately will owe the tax due and a 50 percent penalty—even if there was no fraud intended.\n\nSellers accepting a reseller permit: During an audit, failure to have a valid, current reseller permit or documentation on file may result in the reclassification of the sale from wholesaling to retailing B&O tax. The business will owe retail sales tax for that sale.\n\nBuyers: Using a reseller permit\n\nIf your business has been issued a reseller permit you are responsible for ensuring that the permit is used properly. Use your reseller permit to buy only those items that you resell in the regular course of your business. When you resell those items to consumers, you must collect Washington state and local sales tax and then submit that tax to the Department. For industry specific information on how to use reseller permits, see our Industry guides.\n\nReseller permits may be used to buy:\n\nMerchandise and inventory for resale without being used by the buyer first.\n\nIngredients, components, or chemicals used in processing new products for sale.\n\nFeed, seed, seedlings, fertilizer, and spray materials if you are a farmer.\n\nMaterials and contract labor for retail/wholesale construction.\n\nReseller permit misuse\n\nBusinesses may not use a reseller permit to buy:\n\nItems for personal or household use.\n\nItems to be given away.\n\nItems used in the business, such as supplies and equipment.\n\nItems used by the business in performing the business activity even if billed to customers.\n\nTools or equipment, (unless you are in the business of directly reselling or renting out such items).\n\nMaterials and contract labor for public road construction or U.S. government contracting.\n\nEquipment rentals.\n\nMisuse of a permit may result in penalties for the buyer and the permit may be revoked. Anyone found using a permit inappropriately will owe the tax due and a 50 percent penalty—even if there was no fraud intended.\n\nIf you buy goods to resell but you either don’t have a reseller permit, or your permit has expired, you have the following options:\n\nPay sales tax on your purchases and then take a Taxable Amount for Tax Paid at Source deduction on your tax return when you report the sale of those specific items.\n\nPay sales tax on your purchases and then request a refund directly from the Department.\n\nSellers: Accepting a reseller permit\n\nEvery business that sells at wholesale must obtain a valid reseller permit or other documentation for each customer that buys without paying retail sales tax. Sellers must maintain proper documentation for all wholesale sales for 5 years after the date of sale, and have up to 120 days from the date of the sale to collect the documentation.\n\nIn the event of an audit, you will be asked to provide documentation to support your wholesale sales. Documentation options include:\n\nA copy of the reseller permit.\n\nA printout of the customer's information from our Business Lookup Tool. Use this service to look up one business record at a time.\n\nThe record received through the Reseller Permit Verification Service, exported and saved. Use this free service for looking up multiple records.\n\nSellers may also accept other approved exemption certificates from customers. To be valid, these certificates must be properly completed and signed by the customer.\n\nIf the buyer does not have a valid reseller permit or does not provide an approved exemption certificate, you must collect and remit sales tax.\n\nDuring an audit, failure to have a valid, current reseller permit or documentation on file may result in the reclassification of the sale from wholesaling to retailing B&O tax. The business will owe sales tax for that sale.\n\nYou have the right to refuse to make tax-exempt sales if you have reason to believe the customer is misusing their reseller permit, is not reselling the items purchased, or the permit is expired or otherwise not valid."
