        "text": "From kitchen stoves and gas ranges to washers and dryers, household and other electrical appliances have been manufactured in Mexico for decades. The appliance manufacturing industry in the country is prized for its robust supply chain, quality products, proximity to export markets, and sound production expertise. Statistics show that Mexico is one of the principal exporters of appliances in the world and claims top market spots for exports of some of the most common appliance categories. Major appliances exports include fridges and freezers, range stoves, laundry appliances, and other home products that are sold throughout the world. For example, the kitchen appliances Whirlpool produces are made in Mexico then shipped to homes around the world. Due to such optimal conditions for developing domestic home appliances and products, several worldwide home appliance companies and brands have established facilities within the country.\n\nHome appliance manufacturing in Mexico is home to some of today’s most well-known and largest appliance manufacturers. Major appliance manufacturers and brands include Whirlpool, Electrolux, LG, and Mabe, who manufacture everything from refrigerators, freezers, and dishwashers to ovens, cooktops, and other domestic products in state-of-the-art plants in Mexico. Each local and international manufacturer has founded successful company operations to produce major appliances in the country. The home appliances powerhouse, which once designed and manufactured 95 percent of General Electric’s gas ranges and refrigerators sold in the United States market, operates plants in a number of Mexican locales: Mexico City, Coahuila, Guanajuato, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro, and San Luis Potosi. These Mexican locations are ideal for appliance corporation facilities and product manufacturing. Your company can choose an ideal location to establish global operations in Mexico's growing market."
