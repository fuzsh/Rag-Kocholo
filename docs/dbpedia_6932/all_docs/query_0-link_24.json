        "text": "Home appliances (also called domestic appliances, household appliances, or electric appliances) are electrical or mechanical machines designed to perform a household function, driven by other than human power. Appliances are categorized into small appliances, major appliances, and consumer electronics.\n\nMajor appliances such as dishwashers, clothes dryers, refrigerators, air conditioners, and stoves are considered “white goods.” Originally, white goods were painted or enameled white, and many still are.\n\nConsumer electronics such as televisions, home entertainment systems, and DVD players are considered “brown goods.” Brown goods were named from the color of the wooden cases that were originally used to pack them for shipping.\n\nThe “white” versus ”brown” categorization also implies the respective maintenance and repair of that type of product. Brown goods generally require some technical skills and knowledge such as soldering. White goods typically require more practical skills and tools. This distinction has blurred with the increasing use of electronic control for “white goods”\n\nAlthough many household appliances have existed for hundreds of years, self-contained gas- or electric-powered appliances are considered American inventions introduced during the twentieth century. Historians credit the disappearance of full-time domestic servants in homes to the development of many household appliances. Additionally, increasing discretionary income for American families led to a rise in various appliances.\n\nAppliances dramatically improve our quality of life by helping us complete time-intensive tasks that previously required tremendous amounts of physical effort. So when an appliance breaks, it’s important to have the right documentation, tools, and parts to fix it!\n\nHow do I identify my appliance model? Appliance model information is generally found on a sticker somewhere on your device. More detailed information on locating your model number sticker is available on our individual appliance pages.\n\nYour appliance comes with a key to unlocking its full potential - the Use and Care Manual. This isn't just a booklet; it's your go-to guide for mastering your appliance. Inside, you'll discover:\n\nSafety First: Essential precautions to ensure safe usage.\n\nGetting Started: Steps to take before you power up.\n\nMaintenance Know-How: Tips to keep your appliance in top shape.\n\nTravel and Relocation Advice: Caring for your appliance during vacations and moves.\n\nWarranty Wisdom: Understanding your coverage.\n\nParts and Prowess: A tour of your appliance's features.\n\nOperation Instructions: How to make the most of your appliance.\n\nTroubleshooting Tips: Quick fixes for common hitches.\n\nSupport Stations: Where to find help when you need it.\n\nManufacturers provide these manuals at no extra cost with every appliance purchase, offering foundational support, installation guidance, and maintenance advice. For specific information tailored to your brand, refer to the table below."
