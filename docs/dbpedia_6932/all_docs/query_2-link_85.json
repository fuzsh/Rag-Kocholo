CDC also plays a key role in building state and local health department epidemiology, laboratory, and environmental health capacity to support foodborne disease surveillance and outbreak response.\n\nState Agencies\n\nDuring an investigation of foodborne illness or a recall, federal government agencies may work with state agencies such as the state department of public health or state department of agriculture. If you believe you or someone you know became ill from eating a certain food, please contact your local (county or city) health department. To find out how to contact your local health department, refer to the Web site for your stateâ€™s health department.\n\nDo You Think You Have Food Poisoning?\n\nIf you believe that you or someone you know became ill from eating a certain food or if you suspect that a food is contaminated, see Food Safety: Report a Problem with Food.\n\nPlease send written correspondence to:\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nWeb Communications and New Media Division\n\n200 Independence Avenue, S.W.\n\nWashington, D.C. 20201"
