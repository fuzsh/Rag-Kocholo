        "text": "The System for Award Management (SAM) is an official website of the U.S. Government. There is no cost to use SAM. You can use this site for FREE to:\n\nRegister to do business with the U.S. government\n\nUpdate or renew your entity registration\n\nCheck status of an entity registration\n\nSearch for entity registration and exclusion records\n\nOnce you access the site, you will receive the options listed below. The site suggests entities complete all three options to complete the SAM registration process.\n\nCreate a User Account\n\nRegister Entity\n\nSearch Records\n\nNote, in order to do business with VA, vendors must be registered in SAM.\n\nOffices listed below may be contacted for specific information regarding their programs.\n\nA DUNS number is a unique nine-character number used to identify your organization. The Federal Government uses the DUNS number to track how federal money is allocated. If your organization does not yet have a DUNS number, or not sure what it is, please visit the Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) website or call 866-705-5711 to register or search for a DUNS number.\n\nVA operates a nationwide system of hospitals, clinics, VISN, data processing centers, and National Cemeteries which require a broad spectrum of goods and services. VA purchases these goods and services on a national, regional, and local level. Regardless of how large or small your business is, VA is a potential customer. VA purchases most of its requirements for direct delivery through its local or Regional Procurement Office. You are encouraged to contact each facility for inclusion in its procurement process.\n\nWhat do they buy?\n\nAlthough there are certain priority sources identified by Federal regulations, each facility purchases a considerable amount of its requirements from both local and nationwide sources. Examples of items purchased are:\n\nPharmaceuticals and medical and surgical supplies\n\nPerishable subsistence\n\nEquipment, supplies, and materials for facility operation\n\nMaintenance and repair of medical and scientific equipment\n\nBuilding construction, maintenance, and repair\n\nProsthetic and orthopedic aids\n\nMedical gases\n\nHow do they buy?\n\nAcquisitions are accomplished by sealed bidding, negotiation, or simplified acquisition procedures. Each of these methods is designed to promote full and open competition to the maximum extent possible, which in turn allows all responsible bidders/offerors an opportunity to compete. The most suitable, efficient, and economical procedure will be used, taking into consideration the circumstances of each acquisition. Much of the purchasing is accomplished by using Federal Supply Schedules. A significant portion, however, will be acquired from sources obtained through the publication of solicitations and/or requests for information in the SAM or any other acceptable means that will provide the procuring activity with a sufficient number of responsible bidders/offerors to ensure full and open competition.\n\nOffices listed below may be contacted for specific information regarding their programs.\n\nThe Office of Procurement, Acquisition and Logistics (OPAL), Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC 20420, for enterprise-wide solutions:\n\nNational Acquisition Center\n\nBusiness Resource Service\n\nCommodities and Services Acquisition Service\n\nDenver Logistics Center\n\nNational Contract Service\n\nVA Federal Supply Schedule\n\nStrategic Acquisition Center — Non-IT enterprise-wide solutions for VA’s highly complex requirements\n\nTechnology Acquisition Center — Enterprise-wide solutions in information and technology\n\nThe Office of Construction and Facilities Management (00CFM), Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC 20420, for:\n\nVA Major Construction including Medical Centers and National Cemeteries\n\nLease Acquisition\n\nArchitect/Engineer services\n\nThe Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology (005), Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC 20420, for:\n\nAutomatic data processing systems and equipment\n\nCommunications systems and equipment\n\nThe Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management (004), Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC 20420, for:\n\nEnhanced Use Lease (EUL)\n\nThe Director, National Cemetery System (40), Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC 20420, for:\n\nGrave markers\n\nThe Director, Office of Marketing, Veterans Canteen Service (VCS), Department of Veterans Affairs, #1 Jefferson Barracks Road, Building 1, St. Louis, MO 63125, for:\n\nRetail store supplies\n\nRestaurant supplies\n\nThe Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) provides outreach and liaison support to businesses (large and small) and other members of the private sector. Additionally, OSDBU is responsible for monitoring VA implementation and execution of the following socioeconomic procurement programs:\n\nService-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)\n\nVeteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB)\n\nSmall Disadvantaged Business (includes Section 8(a))\n\nHistorically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zone Small Business\n\nWomen-Owned Small Business (WOSB)\n\nThis office is available only for the purpose of providing information, counseling, and guidance. OSDBU does not award contracts or maintain solicitation mailing lists. To learn about VA Small and Veteran Business Program, and access information and resources on government procurement, subcontracting and partnership opportunities, please visit OSDBU’s website.\n\nVets First Verification Program\n\nIn order to qualify for participation in the Veterans First Contracting Program, eligible SDVOSBs/VOSBs must first be verified. OSDBU’s Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE) manages the Vets First Verification Program, which affords verified firms owned and controlled by Veterans and Service-disabled Veterans the opportunity to compete for VA set asides. Verification extends eligibility for set-asides and sole source contract awards to SDVOSBs and VOSBs. Please visit the Vets First Verification Program website for more information about the VA verification process and how Public Law 109-461 relates to the Veterans First Contracting Program.\n\nHow to Contact the U.S. Small Business Administration\n\nTo learn more about building and growing a small business and entrepreneurship entity, please visit the Small Business Administration. Most businesses do not need to register with the Federal Government to become a legal entity other than simply filing to get a federal tax ID. Small businesses sometimes register with the Federal Government for trademark protection or tax-exempt status."
