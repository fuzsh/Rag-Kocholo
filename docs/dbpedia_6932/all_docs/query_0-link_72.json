        "text": "Although modern home appliance circuits are typically set up to handle high electrical capacities, the National Electrical Code (NEC) requires that large appliances, and certain smaller ones, operate on their own dedicated circuits. Local electric codes are generally based on the NEC but may have more stringent requirements.\n\nBecause large appliances and heat-producing devices typically require higher wattage to operate, they may pull more current than a general-use circuit can safely handle. So don’t create a potential fire hazard! Knowing what appliances require a dedicated circuit will help ensure that your appliances run smoothly and safely.\n\nWhat to Check On\n\nLook on the appliance’s information sticker or plate to find the wattage. As a rule, electronics, and appliances that are rated for 1,000 watts or higher likely need a dedicated circuit, especially if the item will be operating for long stretches of time. For example, a 1,800-watt hair dryer that is used for a few minutes may not require a dedicated circuit, but a 1,800-watt electric fireplace that you will use for hours is likely to need one.\n\nLists of Appliances that Require a Dedicated Circuit\n\nIn the Kitchen\n\nDedicated circuits are highly recommended for all these devices:\n\nElectric oven, stove, or range\n\nRefrigerator\n\nStand-alone freezer or chest freezer\n\nDishwasher\n\nMicrowave\n\nGarbage disposal\n\nToaster oven\n\nCountertop convection oven\n\nCountertop deep fryer or air fryer\n\nWattage usage varies from model to model, so for some items listed, a dedicated circuit may be optional. It depends on the frequency and duration of use. Talk to an electrician about circuit needs, and always err on the side of caution.\n\nAre you on the fence between installing a gas oven versus an electric one? Read the pros and cons.\n\nIn the Laundry Room\n\nElectric dryer\n\nWasher\n\nYour laundry room should have a dedicated circuit of at least 20 amps. If you have a gas dryer, both your washing machine and gas dryer may be plugged into the same outlet. If you have an electric dryer, it will need its own dedicated 20-amp, 220-volt circuit.\n\nIf you typically use other small appliances in your laundry room—like irons or steam devices—a separate circuit for them is a good idea too.\n\nIn Living Rooms and Bedrooms\n\nElectric fireplace\n\nInfrared heater, heater fan, and space heater\n\nWindow air conditioning unit\n\nDepending on wattage requirements, the devices above may need dedicated circuits.\n\nMost lamps, fans, and other low-demand items can be operated on a general-use circuit. Typically, flat-screen televisions, desktop computers and other electronics can be safely operated on a normal circuit, but you should always have them plugged into surge-protected outlets.\n\nIn the Garage\n\nLarge air compressor\n\nPower saw, drill and other power tools\n\nIf you are a do-it-yourself homeowner who uses lots of power tools, one or more dedicated circuits in your garage or workshop is a must-have.\n\nIn Utility Rooms and Outdoors\n\nFurnace and water heater pump\n\nSump pump\n\nCentral air conditioning unit\n\nWater heater\n\nHot tub or spa\n\nLarge holiday light display\n\nGet Professional Help\n\nIf you would like more information regarding NEC requirements and safety recommendations, check with the National Fire Protection Association."
