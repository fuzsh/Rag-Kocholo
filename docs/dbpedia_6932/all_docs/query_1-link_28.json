        "text": "Because your home is your biggest financial investment, you want to protect it. Home and appliance warranties help you protect it, and knowing how to get the most from them can make a difference in how helpful they are.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll take a closer look at home and appliance warranties. And we answer questions so you can make a more informed decision about what option is best for you.\n\nWhat Is a Home Warranty?\n\nA home warranty — not to be confused with homeowner insurance — is an optional service contract that a homeowner can buy to cover home repairs or replace certain items. You can typically choose between a home system plan, an appliance plan, or a plan covering the entire house.\n\nEven if you have manufacturer warranties on certain components of your home, these only last for a period of time, so you’ll likely still benefit from some type of home warranty. Keep reading to discover the different types of warranties, how they work, and what approach is best for you.\n\nBenefits of a Home Warranty or Appliance Warranty\n\nMany benefits come with additional coverage for your home or appliances, including:\n\nAn added layer of protection for the homeowner: A home warranty protects homeowners’ budgets from potentially costly repairs.\n\nDirect and easy access to service providers: You gain access to 24/7 support for service requests. This support can save valuable time and money if something breaks down. Service requests are also handled by prescreened professionals — giving you access to a local network of repair experts.\n\nAdditional benefits during real estate transactions: A home warranty benefits all parties. Buyers reduce the risk of discovering repair concerns that went undetected during the inspection period. Sellers don’t have to worry about being pestered after a home sale if something breaks down shortly after the transaction closes.\n\nAbility to bundle coverage options: There are comprehensive coverage home warranty plans available to handle all repair and maintenance needs by one service provider.\n\nPeace of mind: With additional coverage for your home systems and appliances, you don’t have to worry about unexpected costs as home systems and appliances age.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Home and Appliance Warranties\n\nHow does a home or appliance warranty work?\n\nImagine baking your favorite treats in an oven you purchased last year when it suddenly stops working just outside of the manufacturer’s warranty. Depending on the plan, a home warranty or appliance warranty can cover the cost of repair or replacement instead of having to front the cost yourself. While some warranties have an annual charge, you can choose a monthly home warranty plan to cover the cost of unforeseen maintenance on household appliances or mechanical systems.\n\nWith a home or appliance warranty, you can avoid panic. If an appliance or home system stops working, just place a call or go online to request an appointment with your home warranty company. A professional service technician in the related department will visit the home for repairs. Depending on the coverage, you’re responsible for a small fee for the service appointment. If the home warranty provider can’t repair the item, they’ll likely replace it, depending on the agreement’s terms.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a home warranty and homeowners insurance?\n\nHomeowners insurance is a requirement by mortgage lenders that covers your home in case of structural damage. A home warranty is optional and can help cover the cost of ongoing wear and tear and general home maintenance.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a home warranty and an appliance warranty?\n\nDifferences between a home warranty and an appliance warranty lie in the particular items covered by the warranty. A home warranty covers your home systems. Examples include central air conditioning, central heat and plumbing. An appliance warranty covers the repair or replacement of home appliances, like the washer, dryer, oven and refrigerator.\n\nSears Home Services offers a whole house plan covering 21 major appliances and home systems for one low monthly price.\n\nWhat do home warranties and appliance warranties typically cover?\n\nHome warranties typically cover the following:\n\nCentral air conditioner\n\nCentral heating\n\nPlumbing system\n\nWater heater\n\nWater softener\n\nFaucets and toilets\n\nGarbage disposal\n\nPlumbing stoppages\n\nElectrical system\n\nCeiling fans\n\nGarage door opener\n\nAppliance warranties typically cover the following:\n\nRefrigerator with icemaker\n\nBuilt-in dishwasher\n\nWasher\n\nDryer\n\nRange\n\nCooktop\n\nOven\n\nBuilt-in microwave\n\nRange exhaust fan\n\nBuilt-in trash compactor\n\nThere are also combination plans available to extend coverage.\n\nCan I buy a home warranty when buying a new house?\n\nAbsolutely! When you buy a new home, you’ll have an inspection and work out any repairs with the seller before closing. In some cases, the inspection might miss something, and the buyer may discover that additional repairs are needed after buying the new home. Buying a home warranty plan offers extra protection for the buyer.\n\nRemember that even if you’re buying a new construction home, you may wish to have a home warranty plan to cover potential expenses outside of the manufacturer’s warranty.\n\nHow much does a home warranty cost?\n\nNot all home warranties are created equal, and costs can vary accordingly. Some are annual, while others offer monthly payment options. With Sears Home Services, you can purchase an appliance warranty plan, starting as little as $49.99 per month.\n\nIs the cost of a home warranty worth it?\n\nA home warranty often pays for itself. Even one service call in a year shows the benefit of a home warranty. For example, suppose your refrigerator costs $1,000 to fix. In that case, your low monthly rate is worth the flexibility of no unanticipated large expenses. Think of an extreme case where several large items need repair in the same year. In this scenario, a home warranty plan could prevent a financial disaster caused by unanticipated repair costs.\n\nHow do you get repairs scheduled?\n\nYou can easily book a service request with Sears Home Services online. A service technician in the appropriate department will then come to your home for repairs. If the technician can’t make the repair, they’ll replace the item.\n\nWill I need multiple home warranty plans?\n\nNo. One of the benefits of a home warranty plan is the comprehensive coverage and ease of access to service professionals. Depending on how extensive you want the coverage, you can opt for home, appliance, or whole-house coverage.\n\nWhat are some example expenses I could avoid by having a home warranty or an appliance warranty?\n\nWhen you compare our plans, you’ll discover the typical repair and replacement costs for many common household appliances, including:\n\nA typical central air conditioning unit average repair costs $1,631 or $6,995 for a complete replacement.\n\nTo repair a washer or dryer, you’re looking at a typical repair cost of around $200 or about $500 for a replacement.\n\nThe typical repair cost of an oven or cooktop is $140 but can cost around $804 to replace.\n\nAnother example is a garage door opener, which can cost $150 to repair or $500 to replace.\n\nGet Your Sears Home Warranty Plan Today"
