Article 93, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations provides that States which are not members of the United Nations may become parties to the Statute of the Court on conditions to be determined in each case by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.

Switzerland (as from 28 July 1948), Liechtenstein (as from 29 March 1950), San Marino (as from 18 February 1954), Japan (as from 2 April 1954) and Nauru (as from 29 January 1988) fell into this category before joining the United Nations.

The conditions imposed have hitherto been the same in each case. They were laid down for the first time in Resolution 91(I) adopted by the General Assembly on 11 December 1946 as a result of a request by the Swiss Federal Council (see Basic Documents on this website).
