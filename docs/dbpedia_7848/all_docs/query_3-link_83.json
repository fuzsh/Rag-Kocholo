Before proceeding to reply in detail, the Government of Liech-\n\ntenstein desires to make certain general observations. In the first\n\nplace, the Court will perceive that the basic facts of which Liechten-\n\nstein complains in this case are not in dispute. The Government of\n\nGuatemala does not in its Counter-memorial deny the arrest, deten-\n\ntion and expulsion of Mr. Nottebohm ;the refusa! cifthe Guatemalan\n\nauthorities to re-admit him to the country ; and the sequestration\n\nand later expropriation of the properties of the firm of Nottebohm\n\nBrothers and of Mr. Nottebohm. But Guatemala pleads that none of\n\nthese acts or measures constituted breaches of international law so\n\nas to engage the international responsihility of Guatemala ; and\n\nfurther contests the quantification of damages bg Liechtenstein and\n\nthe valuation of Mr. Nottebohm's property which underlies it. Gua-\n\ntemala therefore largely admits the treatment of Mr. Nottebohm\n\nand his property, of which Liechtenstein complains, though it pleads\n\nin defence that this treatment was justifiable and not unlawful alid\n\nthat the damages daimed are in any event exaggerated.\n\n2. In the second place, the Court cannot fail to be struck by the\n\nfact that, while the ground for this adrnitted treatment of hlr. Notte-\n\nbohm and his property was the fear that his associations or intent\n\nmight be hostile or dangerous to Guatemala in her war with Ger-\n\nmany, the Guatemalan authorities acted solely upon suspicion and\n\nwithout proof. At no time, either when the steps against Mr. Notte-\n\nbohm and his property were being taken or in its exchanges upon the\n\nmatter with the Government of Liechtenstein or in its Counter-\n\nrnemorial, has the Government of Guatemala addiiced any evidence\n\nthat Mr. Nottebohm was in fact hostile to Gusteniala or that in his\n\nassociations or the conduct of his business he endangered wilfully or\n\nunwittingly the national security or interests of Guatemala. It is\n\nindeed remarkable that Guatemala should visit upon an individual\n\nthe most estreme penalties upon a bare suspicion and should stiIl\n\nfurther persist in this course Iong after any grouild for this suspicion\n\nhas heen removed. 3. But, while admitting the basic facts underlying Liechten-\n\nstein's claim, Guatemala contests this daim in laiv and further\n\nraises a number of issues which go to its adrnissibility beforc the\n\nCourt, and to these issues the Government of Liechtenstein \\vil1\n\nnow turn.\n\nPart II.PveviozfisNegotiations\n\nGeneral Observations\n\n4. Guatemala contends that Liechtenstein's claim in respect of\n\nMr. Nottebohm is not admissible kefore the Court on three grounds :\n\nthe alleged lack of prior diplomatic negotiations over the claim ;\n\nthe alleged absence of any genuirie tic of nationality between\n\nRfr.Nottebohm and Liechtenstein ; and the alleged non-exhaustion\n\nby 31r. Nottebohm of remedies available to him in Guatemala.\n\nThe first and last grounds appear to be in some degree alternative\n\nto the second ;for if Guatemala were to establish the second ground\n\nto the satisfaction of the Court the claim would be inadmissible\n\nin limiwe and the other grounds would be irrelevant. It is for this\n\nreason that Guatemala might have been expected ta invoke the\n\nsecond ground by way of a preliminary objection at the same time\n\nas she raised her objection to the jurisdiction of the Court, which\n\njt dismissed on 18 November 1953.\n\n5. Further,the firsl and second grounds have this in common that\n\nthey put in issue theEOC~ sanSdi of Liechtenstein before the Court,\n\nfor they raise questions both of the status of Liechtenstein in inter-\n\nnational relations and of her right to make an international claim\n\nin respect of hlr. Nottebohm before this Court.\n\n6. It mil1therefore be convenient to begin bp clarifying Liechten-\n\nstein's status in international relations. Liechtensteinisan indepen-\n\ndent sovereign State ; and while it is not contested that the diplo-\n\nmatic and consular protection of Liechtenstein nationals is in\n\npractice entrusted to the reyresentatives of Switzerland, it is a\n\nmisconception in paragraph 7 of the Counter-mernorial to suppose\n\nthat any diplomatic or consular intervention by Switzerland on\n\nbehalf of Liechtenstein muçt be conducted in the name of Switzer-\n\nland and not of Liechtenstein itself. Further, it cannot be disputed\n\nthat in the absence ofdiplomaticrepresentativeç, this right of protec-\n\ntion orintervention is exercised by consular offrcials(seealso Guate-\n\nmaIan Lam concerning Aliens of 25th January 1926, S.S3 ;Counter-\n\nmemorial, Annes 17).Hence there \\vas no necessity or requirement\n\nas suggeçted in paragraph 8 of the Counter-mernorial forcommuni-\n\ncations between Liechtenstein and Guatemala to be channelled\n\nthrough Pans. Tndeed the facts that the Guatemalan hlinister to\n\nFrance in Paris mas also the accreditcd representativc of Guatemala\n\nin Switzerland and that Switzerland was not represerited in Guate-\n\nmala by a diplomatic mission but only by a consular officer are378 KEPLY OF THE- GOSTERSllENT OF LIECHT1:NSTEIX (14VI1 j4)\n\nirrelevant; though, as will bc seen, the Swiss Government in fact\n\nna derepeated interventions both through the consular officer in\n\nGuatemala and throngh itçdiplornatic mission in Paris.\n\nFurther, Liechtenstein as an independent State has precisely\n\nthe same right and power to confer its nationality upon aliens by\n\nnaturalization as every other sovereign State.\n\nThe Facfs\n\n7. Xow, as to the first grouncl othe allegcd non-admissibility\n\nof the claim, it will he convenient to set out first the fandsthen\n\nthe rules which are in the opinion of the Government of Liechten-\n\nstein applicable.\n\nAs earlyas December zoth, 1944 the R,linistryof Foreign Affairs\n\nof Guatemala was engaged in an cxchange of notes with the Swiss\n\nGovernment acting, inter alia, on behalf of hlr. Nottebohm, through\n\nits consul in Guatemala (Annex 1).In these exchringes the Govern-\n\nment of Guatemala refiised to recognize the validity, in interna-\n\ntional law, of Mr. Nottebohm's naturalization in Liechtenstein\n\n(Annex 2).This exchange of notes took place upon the initiative of\n\nthe Swiss Political Department (Annex 1).In addition, the S~viss\n\nLegation in Paris, uçing preciseli those channels which in the\n\nopinion of the Government of Guatemala should have becn em-\n\nployed (Counter-mernorial para. 81,intervened with the Gustemalan\n\nMinister in Paris on behalf of hfr. Nottebohm and asked for the\n\nreiease of his property in Guatemala on the grouncl that he had\n\nvalidly acquired Liechtenstein nationality before Guatemala had\n\ndeclared war against Germany and was therefore entitled to be\n\ntreated as a neutral (Annex 3).\n\nFurther, the Government of Liechtenstein addressed a note to\n\nthe Government of Guatemala dated 6th July 1951 (Applicnt'ion,\n\nAnnes 11 , hich was delivered to the GuatemaIan Ministry of\n\nForeign Affairsby the Swiss Consul of Guatemala. The receipt of\n\nthis note was acknowledged by the Guatemdan Ministry of Foreign\n\nAffairs.A second'note dated 24 October 1951 was delivered to the\n\nGovernment of .Guatemala by the same chanilels (AppIication,\n\nAniiex 3).\n\nS. The Swiss and Liechtenstein authorities, in the course of their\n\nintervention on behalf of Mr.Nottebohrn, never left any doubl thst\n\nhe was a nationaol f Liechtenstein;that an international claim was\n\nbeing made in respect of him by Liechtenstein ;and that a settle-\n\nment or an offer of serious negotiation foa settIement were being\n\nsoiight from Guatemala.\n\nThe Government of Liechtenstein has always been ready and\n\nwilling to enter into such negotiations. The delay in the prosecution\n\nof the present proceedings is due solely to its desire to meet the\n\nprofessed wishes of the Government of Guatemala to discuss a\n\nsettlernent. Won-ever,despite its protestations, the Government of REPLIr OF THE GOVEHSlIEST OF LIECHTESSTEIS (14 \\'Ij4)379\n\nGuatemala has failed to pursue the course of negotiated settlement\n\nwhich was always open to it. On the contrary, it has persistently\n\nrejected the representations made between Decernber 1944 and\n\nApril 19j1 by the Government of Liechtenstein through Swissdiplo-\n\nrnatic and consular channels, and has ignored the notes presented\n\nin July 1951 and October 1951, despite the warning which they\n\ncontained that Liechtenstein mould be compelled to bring the rnatter\n\nbefore this Court l.\n\nThe Law\n\n9. In the submission of the Government of Liechtenstein, these\n\nfacts do rlotgive any ground in law for holding that Liechtenstein's\n\npresent claim is inadmissibIe before the Court.\n\nIVhile the reasoning of Section r of the Counter-mernorial is not\n\nmholly clear the Guatemalan Government appears to be saying\n\neither that therc is in the absence of prior diplomatic negotiations\n\nrio dispute between Guatemala and Liechtenstein within the rnean-\n\ning of Article 36 (2) of the Statute of the Court, or that prior diplo-\n\nmatic negotiatians are a condition precedent to the reference of a\n\ndispute to thisCourt, and that this condition has not been satisfied\n\niii this case. Neither position is tenabIe.\n\nIO. The Permanent Court has said :\n\n\"...a difference of opinion does exist as soon as one of the Govern-\n\nments concerned points out that the attitude adopted by the other\n\nconflicts with its own views. Even if ....the existence of a definite\n\ndispute were necessary, this condition coztld afany time befztlfilleby\n\nmeans of irrzilateralactionott thepart of the afiplicaniParty. And the\n\nCourt cannot allow itself to be hampered by a mere defect of form,\n\nthe remoiral of which depcnds solely on the Party concerned\"\n\n(German 17tteresfsin Polish U+per Silesiu, P.C.I.J., Ser.A, No. 6,\n\np. 14) .gain the Court has said :\"The mere denial of the existence\n\nof a dispute does not prove its non-existence\" (Peace Treaties\n\n(First Phase), Adviso~y Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 74).\n\nIn the present case tliere is no political dispritc between the\n\nparties ; ihere is indeecl no substantial dispute as to the basic\n\nfacts of which Liechtenstein complains ; but there is a dispute as\n\nto the legal character and consequences of those basic factç, and\n\nhecause these facts are largely admitted, the Iegal dispute is clearly\n\ndefined. Since x944 there has been a difference of opinion, manifested\n\nin the diplomatic exchanges between Liechtenstein and Guatemala,\n\nSubsequently, by lettergoSeptember 1952,the Ninistcr ofForeign Affairs\n\nofGuatemala indicated that was prepared to begin negotiations. This invitation\n\nrcpresentativof the Govcrnment of Liechtenstemet the represcntativof the\n\nGovernrnent of Guaterriala on several occandothere nas an incrcasing hope of\n\na reasonable solutioThc lastoccasionwas on 6 August 1953; since that time\n\nnothing furthervashearclfrom the Government of Guatemala.380 REPL\\-OF THE COVERNXIEKT OF LIECHTKNSTEIF (14 vlI54)\n\nas to 3lr. Xottcbohm's entillernent to the releasc of his propcrty\n\nirom sequcstration and expropriation, and as to Guatemala's right\n\nto expel him and to refuselater to re-admithim. There could hardly\n\nbe a clearcr case of a legal dispute betn-eetwo States. Indeed,the\n\nfact that the Guaternalan Government chose to ignore the two\n\nnotes presented by the Government of Liechtenstein in July and\n\nOctober IgjI would alone create a dispute between the parties\n\nwithin the meaning of the unqualified language of Article 36 (2)\n\nof the Statute of the Court.\n\nII.Fiirthcr, the practice of the Permanent Court of International\n\nJustice shows that it is not a pre-condition that the parties musi\n\nhave concluded negotiations and that these negotiations must\n\nhave failed, for the jurisdiction of the Court to he invoked (cf,\n\nHudson, The Pcrnrnne?zf Coztrt oj Interfzatio~~aJustice, 1919-42\n\n(1943)~pp. 413,414) .roof of a speciîic manifestation of disagree-\n\nment and of previous diplomatic negotiations is required only in\n\nthose special circi~mstances tvhcre the instrument by which the\n\njurisdiction of the Court is invoked lays downthiscondition ;as foc\n\nexample in Article 26 of the Palestine Mandate considered in\n\nlllavro~?z~natisColtcessioltCase (~924) P.C.T.J. Ser. A, No. 2,\n\npp. 15, 62, and see Sofia Eleclri~i~Company Case (193g},P.C.I.J,\n\nSer. A/B, No. 77, pp. 83, 132. The reliance by Guatemala on the\n\npassage from p. 15 of the Mauronztilaiis Co~zcessio~rCsase cited\n\nin yaragrayh 7 of its Counter-mernorial is \\vholly rnisconceived,\n\nfor the Permanent Court \\vas there conccrned with the interpre-\n\ntation of Article 2'6of the hiandate.\n\n12.On the other hand, where the provision conferring jurisdic-\n\ntion upon the Court does not cal1 for the conduct of prior diplo-\n\nmatic negotiatioris, the Court has been unwilling to insist on this\n\nrequirement. Thus, as regards article 23 of the Geneva Convention\n\nof 1922, the Court said:\n\n\"Article 23, differing ithis respect from many compromissory\n\nclauses ....does not stipulate that diplomatic rlegotiatio~~smust\n\nfirst of all be trie....\"(GertnnnInferests inPolish 0-pper Silesia,\n\nP.C.I.J. Ser. A,No. 6,p. 14) T.he Court conduded :\n\n\"....recoursernay be had to the Court as soon asone ofthe parties\n\nconsiders that a difference of opinion arising out of the construc-\n\ntion and applicatioii ui Articles 6 22 [of the Geneva Convention]\n\nexists\" (loc.cif.p.14).\n\n13.111the present case, there was, to put it at its Iow7est, an\n\nexchange of vieivç, a discussion, betsveen the Governments of\n\nGuatemala and Liechtenstein ; itcame tu an end in circumstances\n\nwhich disclosed a clear difference of opinion on more than one\n\nlegal issue.It is plain then that, even if prior negatiationwere a\n\npre-condition of the admissibility of this dispute, what happened REPLY OF THE GOVERSAIEST OF LIECHTEKSTEIS (14 VI154) 381\n\ninthe present case jevouldsatisfy the test laid down by the Perma-\n\nnent Court :\n\n\"Ncgotiations do not of necessity always presupposc a more or\n\nless lengthy series of notcs and despatchcs ; it may suffice that a\n\ndiscussion should have been commenced, and this discussion may\n\nhave been very short ;this will be the case if a deadlock is reached\n\nor if finally a point is reached at which one of the Parties definitely\n\ndeclares himself unable, or refuses, to give way, and there can\n\ntherefore be no doubt that the dispute cannot be settled by diylo-\n\nmatic negotiations\" (!llnvronttnat?s Concessions Case (Jrlvisdicfiotz),\n\nibid.,y: 13).\n\n14. In the submiçsion of the Government of Licchtenstein there-\n\nfore :\n\nthere has been since 1944 a legal dispute subsisting betn~een\n\n(i) Guatemala and Liechtenstein as to the trcatment of Mr.\n\nNottcbohm ;\n\n(ii) Article 36 (2) of the Statute of the Court and Guatemala's\n\nDeclaration accepting the jurisdiction of thc Court do not\n\nin 1s~ make it a coi~dition of the admissil~ility of Liechten-\n\nstein's claim that it should have been subject to yrior negotia-\n\ntions for its scttlernent;\n\n(iii) even if prior negotiations for settlement had been a necessarjr\n\ncondition in law, this condition \\vas in fact satisfied by the\n\nexchanges between the Governments from 1944to 1951 ;\n\nalternatively, ncgotiations were rendcred abortive by Guate-\n\nmala's attitude nrhich itself created a dispute refcrable to the\n\nCourt.\n\nPart III. Tlze Nationality of MY. Nottebohnt\n\nrj. The Govcrnment of Liechtenstein will now turn to the secoiid\n\nground on ~vhichGuatemala hases her pleü of inadmissibility of the\n\nclaim :the aileged absence of any genuine tie of nationality between\n\nMr. Nottebohm and Liechtenstein.\n\nThc issue of Mr. Nottehohm's nationdity goes both to the admis-\n\nsibility of Liechtenstein's claim before this Court and to the merits\n\nof that claim. As to admissibility, the question iswhether the Court\n\ncan recognize RTr.Nottebohm as a national of Liechtenstein ; as to\n\nthe incrits, the question is whether Guatemala was hound to recog-\n\nnizc hirn as a national of Liechtenstein and to treat him as a neutral\n\nçubject. At this stage of the Reply, only the first rlucstion must be\n\nconsidered. 16. XOWLiechtenstein has laid bcfore the Court thc ccrtificate\n\nof MI- . ottebohm's naturalization in Liechtenstein, dated Octo-\n\nber zo, 1939 (Mernorial, Annex z),and the further certificatc issued\n\nby the Government of Liechtenstein on May 6, 1946 (hlemorial,\n\nAnnex 6, paras. 18, 20). The authenticity of thesc documents and\n\ntheir bona fide issue by the Governnient of Liechtenstein are not\n\ndisputed. The certificate of naturalization is therefore $rima facie\n\nevidence of nationality, Medina Case (Moore, Internalional Arbitra-\n\ntioirs,111,p.2587) ;it establishes a presumption that Mr, Nottebohm\n\nis a Liechtenstein national, which, upon the principle orn~ia #Y@-\n\nS~~~~ZLIZ~Z$te acta esse: Salem Case (1932 2)R.I.A.A., at p. 1186 ;\n\nChazen Case(Rlexico-U.S.A.)(1930), 3 Opinion Commissioners p. 32,\n\nthe Court should accept as conclusive, unless Guatemala is able to\n\ndisplace the presumption 11y contrary evidence.\n\n17. The question then arises, what evidence can displace the pre-\n\nsumption or, to put it another wap, what lirnits are there set to the\n\nscrutiny by the Court of the Liechtenstein certificate of naturaliza-\n\ntioii ? In the submission of the Government of Liechtenstein, the\n\nCourt, sitting asan international tribunal, may scrutinize a certifi-\n\ncate of naturalization, the validity of which is challenged, to see\n\nwhether it mas either contrary to the rules of international law\n\nrelating to nationality, or obtained by fraud.\n\nNationaZity and Inlevnationnl Law\n\n18. Since nationality is a matter within the domcstic jiirisdiction\n\nof each State :T.ztnisandMoroccoA'ationalityDecrees [1923],P.C.I.J.\n\nSer. 3,No. 4, pp. 23-4,there are no rules of interiiatioiial law restrict-\n\ning the grant of nationality as çuch.\n\nThe Report of the Codification Commission appointed by the\n\nLeague of Nations confirms this, when it states :\n\n\"... les questions concernant la nationalité sont à envisager\n\ncomme des pr?blèrnes appartenant exclusivement a ia législation\n\nintérieure des Etats particuliers....Il n'existe point une iiorme cou-\n\ntumikre ou écrite du droit international qui puisse êtrcregardée\n\ncomme statuant une restriction ou mêmeune exemption de la com-\n\npétencesusmentionnée\" (P. 196, M. 70, p. g).\n\nBut naturalization may in a particuJar case trailsgrcss the general\n\nprinciple thata State rnay not, saye in certain cases with which this\n\nReplp is not concerned, assert jurisdiction outside its territory with-\n\nout the consent of the States or individuals concerned. Nationality\n\ncannot be imposed upon any individual outside a State's jurisdiction\n\nwithout that individual's request or consent, unless there is a clear\n\ncoiinectionbetweeii the individual-and that State justifying such a\n\nstcp. Thus Hall (Intenzalional Law (8th ed., 194, S.66) says : REPLY OF THE COVERSAIEST OF LIECHTEKSTEIS (14 VI1 54) 383\n\n\"Hitherto ...[International Law1 has refrained, except on one\n\npoint, from laying down any principles, and still more from\n\nsanctioning specific usages in the mattcr. It declares that fAe\n\nguality of a subject mzcst not be in~posed upon certain yersoiis\n\nwith regard to whose position as members of another sovereign\n\ncommunity it is considered that there is no room for the existence\n\nof doubt ...but where a difierence of legal the or^c^n exist inter-\n\nnational lam made no choice, and it içleft open to States to act\n\nas they like\" (see also Politis, Hngzte Kectteil, 6 (1925) 1, at\n\nPP 55-56).\n\nIt is a further condition of anv breach of international law\n\nthat there must be an actual grant of naturalization in n forrn\n\ncompatible with the rule just described. The bare enactment of\n\nnationality legislation which, if applied to particular individualç,\n\nmight give riçe to a hreach of international law, is not iii itself\n\ncontrary ta international Iav-.\n\n19. The Guatemalan Government, in paragraphs 17 and rS\n\nof its Counter-memorial, acknowledges the absence of specific\n\nrestrictions in international lait7 upon grants of nationality, but\n\nalleges that thc provisions in the Liechtenstein law of Nationality\n\nof 4 January 1934 constitute an abuse of rights since they permit\n\nthe Liechtenstein aiithorities to dispense in particular cases with\n\nthe requirement of residence and of direstment of the previous\n\nnationality for the grant of naturalization. As will be seen, the\n\nLiechtenstein Government did not dispense in >Ir. Xottebohm's\n\ncase with the second requirement and, since the bare claim of\n\nright to dispense with it cannot be contrary to international\n\nlaw (nor in fact would its exercise be), that particular objection\n\nby the Guatemalan Government fails.\n\nResidence as a Condifion Jor Na tztrcllzznfz'on\n\n20. As to the alleged requirement of residence in the naturalizing\n\nState, both principle and State practice demonstrate that there\n\nis no such rule of international law.\n\nThe practice of International Tribunals provides no answer\n\nwhether any, and if 50 what, period of residence is required before\n\nnaturalization can be granted, but an esamination of the nation-\n\nality legislation of States shows that in a varietof circumstaiices\n\n-and not only in the case of exceptional services rendered to\n\nthe country where the naturalization takes place-a great number\n\nof countries confer their nationality by way of naturalization,\n\nalthough the person to be naturalized did not reside within the\n\nterritory of the naturalizing State (Aiinex 4).\n\n21. In view of this fact writers dealing with the subject have\n\nasserted that residence for a specific period is not a binding\n\nrecluirement of international law (htaury, Répertoire de Droit\n\nI~zternational, vol. g (1930)p~ . 281,No. 73 ; Rundstein, Zeit-334 REPLY OF THE GOVERXJIEST OF LIECHTENSTEIN (14 VI154)\n\nsclzrijt fir62kerrecht,16 (1932), p. 30). The reqiiirement is purely\n\nfacultative, as the Committee of Experts appointed by thc Lcague\n\nof Nations declared (Basis of Discussion, No. 6, cited by Iifaury,\n\nloc. cit.: \" ....La législation d'un État peut subordonner cette\n\nperte de la nationalité à certaines conditions légales concernant\n\n....le lieu de résidence.\"\n\n22. Of course the State of which the naturalized person is a\n\nnational and where he still resides iç free to disregard the acqui-\n\nsition of another nationality abroad, where the person concerned\n\ndoes not reside (Jlaury, loc.cit., y281, No. 73).Rut it içsignificant\n\nthat those States which have embodied an express provision to\n\nthis effect (Maury, loc. cit.) in their Nationality Laws did so\n\nclearly on the understanding that a naturalization abroad in\n\nthese cohditions is not void and that a special provision excluding\n\nits effect in the State of residence is rcquired, while other States\n\nrecognize such naturalizatioiis without demur (Maury, Eoc.cil.).\n\n23. In so far as third States are concerned, the rulc rcgarding\n\nthe nationality of claims protects them against changes of nation-\n\nality by resident aliens for the purpose of pressing cornplaints\n\narising from acts prior to naturalization.\n\n24. The Government of Guatemala cloesnot strengthen its case\n\nby contending that the naturalization of a non-resident alien\n\nconstitutes an abuse of rights and thus a violation of international\n\nlaw (Countermemorial, paras. 16, 17). Abuse of rights is said\n\nto occur when a State avails itself of its right in an arbitrary\n\nmanner in such a way as to inflict upon another State an injury\n\nwhich cannot be justified by a legitimate corisidcration of its\n\nown advantage (Oppenheim, Inter~aationaELaw (7th cd., 1948),\n\np. 313). It would seem that abuse of rights may manifest itself\n\nin a conflict of legally recognized rights resulting in the dcfeat\n\nof the weaker, or in the lawful exercisc of legal rights for irnproper\n\nmotives (Politis, Hague Recueil, 6 (1925) 1, p. 36). In either case,\n\nan injury must have been inflicted upon another State. In fact\n\nthe Guatemalan Government is misapplying the concept of abuse\n\nof rights, for what it is realIy alleging is that Liechtenstein has\n\nacted in excess of. State jurisdiction in naturalizing an alien\n\nwho had not been a resident of Liechtenstein \"for a niimber of\n\nyears\". The vagueness of this alleged requirement and its obvious\n\nincompatibility with general State practice show the absurdity\n\nof the Guatemalan contention.\n\n25. Liechtenstein nationality was not imposed on Mr. Notte-\n\nbohm ; he requested the grant of naturalization and submitted\n\nhimself willingly and deliberately to the necessary process required\n\nby Liechtenstein law. If the grant was irregular it could, on the REPLY OF THE GOVEKNIlEST OP LIECHTESSTEIS (14 VI154) 385\n\nGuatemalan Government's argument in paragraphs 16-18 o,nly\n\nbe so by reason of failure to comply with the alleged requirement\n\nof rcsidence. That there is no such requirement under international\n\nlaw has already been demonstrated. The grant of naturalization\n\nto 317. Nottebohm was therefore not \"an irregular exercise of\n\ncompetence\" nor an abuse of rights, for even the Guatemalan\n\nGovernment does not plead or attempt to prove any injury or\n\niiitended injury to either Germany or Guatemala, the only other\n\nStates which might consider themselves ititerested in Bfr. Sotte-\n\nbohm's naturalization in Liechtenstein.\n\n26. But the core of the argument of the Guatemala11 Goverri-\n\nment on the issue of nationality lies in its allegation of fraud.\n\nYet it is not easy to trace the line of Guatemala's support for this\n\ngrave allegation. She commences with thc citation of authorities\n\non fraudulent naturalization (paragaph 14 of the Countermemo-\n\nrial); makes a passing suggestion that the Liechtenstein riatiori-\n\nality law \"does not provide the guarantees of seriousness and\n\nstability ivhich are to be found in the various laws of other countries,\n\nancl il encourages cphemeral changes of natioiiality for reasons of\n\nmere convenience\" (para. 18) ; expatiates on the alleged close\n\nlinks betiveen Mr. Nottebohm and Germany (para. 23) and says\n\nthat by \"an express or tacit agreement on the part of the German\n\nauthorities that he should acquire this new nationality\" Germany\n\nbecame a \"party to the fraud\" (paras. 24 and 25) ;and finally\n\ninsinuates that Liechtenstein \"could have had no doubt as to the\n\nreasons behind the application for naturalization Fvhichhad been\n\nsubmitted to itJJ by Mr. Nottebohm (para. 28).Further the Guate-\n\nmalan Government say that his naturalization in Liechtenstein\n\nwas \"irregular ancl factitious\" (paras. II, 34) ; \"nothing but a\n\nmanŒuvre\" (para. 25) ;and \"far too artificial for the International\n\nCourt of Justice to have regard to it\" (para. 21).\n\n27, Liechtenstein's reply is simple:first, Guatemala has adduced\n\nnot factsbut bare çpeculation, ~rhichfallç far short of the standard\n\nof proof necessary to maintain a charge of fraud ; second, she\n\nniisconceives what iç cognizable by an international tribunal as\n\nfraud.\n\nScr~rti~zyO# Foreig 4cts of Natzlralizalion\n\n2s. It is submitted that the modern practice in this field is\n\naccurately sumrned up by Borchard, Difiloinatic Proieclioltof\n\nCitizel Azbroad (~grg), pp. j22-23 in these words :\n\n\"...international tribunals have often asserted and exercised\n\nthe right to determine for thernselves the citizenship of claimants\n\nfroin al1 the facts yresented.

It is significant\n\nthat Makarov observes :\n\n\"l'emploi de cette notion du changement frauduleux de natio-\n\nnalité devient de plus en pliis rare\" (Hagtae Recueil, 74 (1949 ),\n\nPP. 331-34)-\n\n30. This notion, which \\vas employed in Taanty v. Tnnmy\n\n(Counter-mernorial, para. 14),is limited to the yractice of municipal\n\ncourts administering rules of private international law (Counter-\n\nmernorial, paras. 85, S6).The reason is that, with few exceptions,\n\nmunicipal courts have declared thernçelveç'inconipctent to scruti-\n\nnizc the validity of foreigii naturalizations (see the cascs cited by\n\nMakarov, Allgemeine Lelzrett des Staatsangehiirigkeitsrechtp,. 326).\n\nInstead, when called upon by their rules of private international\n\nlaw to apply the Eexpatriæ of a person in matters of status or\n\nsuccession, they have refuscd to do so, if that person was formerl;\n\na national of their own ~vhohad obtained naturalization abroad\n\nin circumstances which showed that he had no serious desire to\n\nchange hiç aiiegiance (Taanzy v.Taanzy) and thnt the naturaliza-\n\ntion was \"un vain simulacre et une apparence mensongère\" (~VIéna-\n\nbréa v. illénabréa,decided on 18 June 1896, Clunet 1896, pp. 842,\n\n844).They have. howc\\rcr,'hcld othemise if it was an \"actc sérieuxet dtifinitif [qui] entrainepour le demandeur des conséquences\n\nles PIUSréelles\" (Méizabréa v.

Nottebohna\n\nValidity, Frnlad\n\n31.The certificate of naturalization of Mr. Nottebohm is privna\n\nfacie evidence of the validity of the naturalization in Liechtenstein.\n\nNevertheless, it is now proposed to examine whether the act of\n\nnaturalization did in fact conform with the Nationality Act of\n\nLiechtenstein (Mernorial, Annes I ; Countermemorial, Anriex 1).\n\nThe Government of Liechtenstein does not admit that the Goverri-\n\nment of Guatemala, or indeed the Court, is cntitled to question\n\nthe validity of the certificateof naturalization on the ground that\n\nits grant \\vas not in conformity with Liechtenstein law, as already\n\nstatcd (paras. 28-30). How~ever,since the Government of Guatemala\n\nhave alleged that the grant of naturalization to Mr. Nottebohm\n\ndid not in fact conform with the requirements of Liechtenstein\n\nlaw, the Government of Liechtenstein feels bound, simply from\n\nregard for the triithta refute these allegations. The question will\n\nalso be examined whether the act was tainted by fraud within the\n\nnormal meaning (above, para. 281, that is to Say whether it was\n\nobtained by an intentional and dishonest misrepresentation or\n\nsuppression of material facts practised by Mr. Iiiottebohm. The\n\nquestion whether there is or can he any fraud within the second\n\nmeaning, that is to Say, that Mr. Nottebohm has not availed\n\nhimself of the privileges of his new nationality, thus çhowing no\n\nserious intention to change his nationality, will be discussed\n\nsubsequently (paras. 36-41).\n\nLieclzfenstein Lnw- Conditions\n\n32.

No fraud tainted the validity\n\nof the act of naturalizatio~i in Liechteristein.\n\n36. The Government of Guatcrnala coritcnds that cveri if the\n\nnaturalization in Liechtenstein were valid, imiiçt be regarded as\n\ntainted with fraud in the second meaning discussed above (paras.\n\n29-30) on the ground that hlr. Nottebohm has not availed himself\n\nof the privileges of hi5 ne\\\\: iiationality and has thereby shown no\n\nserious intention to change his nationality, For this piirpose the\n\nGovernment of Guatemala relies on a nurnber of unconnected\n\ninferences drawn from his life and business actiyities in Guatemala\n\n(Countermemorial, para. 22),his alleged visits to Cermany (ibid.,\n\npara. 22),and his trade with that country(ibid para. 231, from his\n\nfailurc to divest himself carlicr of his German nationality and to\n\nliquidate his affairs in Guatemalaibid para. 24) and from certain\n\nGcrman documents (ibid., paras25-27).\n\n37. The fact that he lived and traded in Guatemala (Couriter-\n\nmemonal, paras. 23, 24) for 34 pars tvithout acquiring Guatemaian\n\nnationality permits the inference that Mr. Kottebohm had at no\n\ntimc the intention of becoming a Guatemalan. It does not permit\n\nthe inference that he had no serioirs intention, especially after the\n\ncoming to power ofHitler in1933, of spending his old age in Liech-\n\ntenstein and of settliiig there. The fact that iii the course of his\n\noperations as a banker hc accepted large deposits from German\n\nsources is of no significance. Depositors place their monies with\n\nbankers upon considerations of commercial reputation and ~iot\n\nof the nationality- or political convictions of the banker, Bankers,\n\nbeing businessrnen, accept deposits regardless of iiationnly,race\n\nor creed.\n\n38. It is difficult to see what inference is to be drawn from the\n\nalleged intimate connection between the firm of Nottebohm and\n\ncertain German enterprises of considerable commercial standing\n\n(Countermemorial, para. 23). By the same token his commercial\n\nrelations, as an export and import merchant, with commercial\n\nhouses in the United States would permit the presumption of pro-\n\nAmerican leanings. The fact that as a result of allegations of trading\n\nwith these firms between 1939 and the date when Guatemala\n\nentered the war, the firm and Mr. Nottebohm were placed on the\n\nBritish Black List and in July 1941 on the United States Black\n\nList, is equaüy irrelevant. Neutrals areentitled to trade with both\n\nbeiiigerents, subject to the right of the latter to stop such trade, and\n\nnothing can be inferred from such conduct as to their loyalties.\n\nThe matter would have a different complexion if Guatemala, while\n\nremaining neutral, had yrohibited trade with the Axis Powers.

The Government of Guatemala contends that the failure of\n\nMr. Nottebohm to liquidate his interests in Guatemala with aview\n\nto returning to settle in Liechtenstein is an indication that hhad\n\nno serious intention of availing himself of the privileges of his new\n\nnationality and that the naturalization was therefore tainted by\n\nfraud. Such an inference is wholly unwarranted here. The American-\n\nEgyptian Tribunal stated in the Sabnt Case:\n\n\"It is in noway exceptional or unusual that he who acquires a\n\nnew nationality should keep up to a certain degree the domestic and\n\nbusiness interests which connect him with his previous home\"\n\n(Hackworth, [1932]z R.I.A.A., p. 1165 at 1'.1186).\n\nIn the present case, the liquidation of Mr. Xottebohm's business\n\ninterests in Guatemala was a complicated matter. Moreover, the\n\ndifficulties which affected the business in consequence ofthe out-\n\nbreak of ivarand thus the value of Mr. Nottebohm's interests, u70uld\n\nhave made an immediate and preciyitated disposa1 of his interests\n\ntherein a very unprofitable proposition. Insteadhis presence as the\n\nexperienced senior partner \\vas imperative. Nor could he have\n\nreached Liechtenstein, except by crossing Axis-occupied territory.\n\nFinaHy, within little more than three years, he waç interned. To-day\n\nhe has no intention of returning to Guatemala. The applications\n\nmade on his behalf in 1946 were motivated by the justified desire\n\nto hring some order into the chaos which the measures of the Guate-\n\nmalan Government had created in the administration ofhis property\n\nand to take such measures of protection as might have been avail-\n\nable to a person on the spot.\n\nAttitude of the Gevmalz Goverlz~nettl\n\n.41.The Government of Guatemala contends, further, that\n\nMr. Nottebohm's naturalization in Liechtenstein was tainted by\n\nfraud on the ground that he had obtained a previous assurance\n\nfrom the German Government guaranteéing his re-admission to\n\nGerman nationality after the end of hostilities. In the absence\n\nof any evidence in support, the Govern~nent of Guatemala relies\n\non a circular letteof the German Foreign Office,dated 4 July 1939392 REPLY OF THE GOVERNhIENT OF J,IECHTEBSTEIK (14 VI154)\n\n(Countermemorial, Annes 2), outlining the neiv policy, a copy of\n\nwhicIi, as the Government of Guatemala alleges, was fourid in\n\nColombia, and uyon a liçt, without names, of Gcrmari iiationals\n\nwho applied through the Gcrlnan diplornatic rcpresentativc in\n\nUruguay to the naturalization authorities of their last residence\n\nin Germany for an assurance of privileged re-admission at a later\n\ndate (Countermernorial, Annes 3). Moreover, Mr. Nottebohm was\n\nunaware of the existence of the circular letter and of the lists\n\nalleged to have been prepared by the German Legation in Uruguay.\n\nThese allegationç were first hrought to his knowledge by the\n\nCountermemorial. Iii any case, the German poiicy here declared\n\nwas .to consider favourably-not to promise-re-admission to\n\nGerman nationality of individuais ivho were ~iaturalized in their\n\ncountry of residence. There is no indication at al1 that the Gerrnan\n\nauthorities could have givc~i any favourable consideratiori to\n\nnaturalization in anothcr country.\n\n42. The Goverrime~it of GuatemaIa has not atteriipted to prove\n\nits allegations on this point by submitting evideiice that Mr. Notte-\n\nbohm made such ai application ; but the Gover~irneiit of Liech-\n\ntenstein has thought it right to make enquiries with thc competent\n\nauthorities in Germany. Thcse show that no such application was\n\nreceived in Germany aiid that no consent was giveil l)y the German\n\nGovernment (Annes 19).\n\nRetention of Gerjnalz Nalio~zuli~y\n\n43. The circumstance that hiIr. Xottebohm inight have made\n\nan application, if he had so been inclined, but did not in fact do\n\nso, is no reason for treating him as a potential German, as the\n\nGovernment of Guatemala appears to contend (Countermemorial,\n\nparas.25-27, 32). Such a11assertion would introduce, in an enlarged\n\nrnanner, the concept of a.nationaiity \"à titre virtuel\".\n\nThe notion of a permanent nationality \"à titre virtuel\" in such\n\na case as the present has never been put forurard iii iiiternatiorial\n\nlaw. It would create a status of permanent nationality and would\n\nthus coritradict the principle that a person mal' expatriate himself.\n\n44. The Government of Guatemala contends thüt, cveri if\n\nMr. Nottebohm's naturalization were valid, he r(:rnainccl a German\n\nin virtue of para. 25 of the German Nationality La~vof 22 July\n\n1913 which providcs that\n\n\"German nationality is riot lost by a person who bcforc acquiring\n\nforeign citizenship has secured on application the written consent\n\nof the cornpetent authority of his home State to retai~i his citizen-\n\nship....\"\n\nThe question whether Mr. Xottebohm made an application to\n\nthis effect was discussed above (para. 42) where it was shown that\n\nno evidence \\.hatsoever exists that he ever did so. Iiistcad, iipon REI)I,YOF THE GOVERSSIEST OF 1.lECHTESSTEIS (14 VI1 54) 393\n\nhi5 arriva1 iiGuatemala, he had his ilanic erascd from the register\n\nof German nationals kept by the Cermali legation.\n\nAttitzcdeof other States\n\n4j. Finally, it is interesting to note that oii 24 Ju1y 1946 the\n\nSwiss Clearing authorities, as the official orgarl of the Swiss Govern-\n\nment and of the Allies for carrpiiig out the Washington Convcntio~i,\n\nrecognizcd that Mr. Nottebohm is exclusivelj a national of 1-icch-\n\ntenstcin (Annes 18) and that on 21 Oecember 1950 the Department\n\nof Justice of the Governmeiit of the United States acknowledged\n\nhis non-enem>- charactcr as well as that of Nattebohm Hermaiios\n\n(Blemorial, hnnes 3).\n\n46. In vicw of the facts and considcrations set out above, the\n\nGovernment of Liechtenstein attaches but secondary importance to\n\nthe question of the principle of cstoypcl. It must point out, how-\n\never, that the right, embodied in Article 50 of the Guatemalan\n\nAliens Law (Countermemorial, Anne>; 1.7)of the authorities and of\n\npivate perçons to challenge the dociirnents which form the basis for\n\nthe inscription in the register of Aliens (Coiintermernorial, para37).\n\nis subject to the provisions of Article 49 of the same law. This\n\nstates that the inscription in the register of aliens creates a legd\n\nprcsumption that the alien possesses the nationality which has heen\n\nrecorded. Evidence to the contrary is admittcd, the implication of\n\nthe ruIc plainly beirtg that only clcar and positive evidence cün diç-\n\nplace the presumption. The Guaternalati Government can hardly\n\nexpect the Court to be satisfied with tower standards of proof than\n\nit requires under its ourn laws.\n\n47. In the case of $Ir. Nottebohin the Goverriment of Guatemala\n\nmerely coiitested the vaiidity of his naturalization with the result\n\nthat his forrncr iiationality was rilleged to have adhcred to him. No\n\nevidencc was adduced. Instead 3lr. Nottebohm was given the status\n\nof a statutory German in virtuc of Article 7 (a) of the Legislative\n\nDecrce Xo. 630 (Coiintermcrnorial, Anncs 39).\n\n48. It follows that >Ir. Nottebohm has regularly acquircd the\n\nnatianality of Liechtenstein accordir~gto thc 1aw ofLiechtenstein,\n\nthat his naturalization was not taintcd by fraud in the scnse that he\n\neifherintentionally and dishonestly misled the competentauthorities\n\nin Licchtenstcin or that he had no serioiis intention to assume the\n\nrights aiid duties of his new nationality, aiid that he lohis Gerinan\n\nnationaiitÿ irrevocably.\n\ndg. In these circuinstances the Government of Liechtenstein\n\nconcludes :394 REPLY OF THE GO\\'ERX.\\IE';TOF 1,TECHTEXSTEIS (14 VI1 j4)\n\nthat the ilaturalization of hlr. Nottebohrn in virtue of the\n\nNationality Law of Liechtenstein does not violate international\n\nlaw ;\n\nthat in the absence of any evidence to the contrary produced\n\nby the Government of Guatemala MF. Nottebohm has validly\n\nacquired the nationality of Liechtensteiti ;\n\nthat in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, Mr. Notte-\n\nbohm has validly divested himself of German nationality ;\n\nthat for these reasons, the claim presented by the Government\n\nof Liechtenstein is admissible.\n\nPart IV. Exknzrstion O/ Local Renzedies\n\nA. General Obsewntions\n\n50. The Government of Guatemala asserts fiiiallÿ that the\n\nclaim is inadmissible un the ground that hlr. Kottebohm has\n\nnot exhausted local remedies available to him. In support of this ,\n\nconte~ition it cites by way of a general ellumeration a formidable\n\narray of procedural measures (Countermemorial, paras. 46-53).\n\nYet the Government of Guatemala does not essay to explain\n\nby whom, against what decisions and at what ti~nethese remedies\n\nshould have been employed. Faced with the fact that the Govern-\n\nment of Guatemala has not discharged its onus probandi, the\n\nGovernment of Liechtenstein has to rely at this stage of the\n\nproceedings only on the evidence which they have obtained from\n\nthe authonties in Guatemala and which is to be found in the\n\nProceedings 46 and 109 (Mernorial, Annes j; Rcply, Annex 22).\n\nThe Strbject-ntatter of the Claim\n\n51. But it is not disputed that the tneasures which form the\n\nsubject of the present claim are :\n\nthe sequestration of the coffce, the coffee plantations and\n\n(i) other farms, and of other property ;\n\n(ii) the expropriation of the coffee plantations, farms, townhouxs,\n\nbank deposits, mortgages and shares ;\n\n(iii) thearrest, detention and internment of hfr. Nottebohm ;\n\n(iv) the refusa1 to re-admit him to Guatemala after the release\n\nfrom internment.\n\nThe Liechtenstein Government will therefore reply to the rather\n\nimprecise contentions of the Countermemoriai by submitting\n\nanswcrs to these questions :1s the non-eshaustion of local remedies\n\na possible ground of inadmissibility at al1 in the present case ?\n\nWhat were the Guatemalan measures against which Rlr. Nottebohm\n\nis said to have remedies available ? What were these remedies and 1\n\nwhy werc they not effective ?

Freeman, Denial O# Justice, p. 432.\n\n33. 111the present case, the claim of the Government of Liechten-\n\nstein is predicated on the grouncl of an initial breach of international\n\nlaw. It is broadly that a national of Liechtenstein, a lieutrd State,\n\n\\vasdeprivcd of his property and his liberty as a war measure by the\n\nGovernment of Guatemala, ~ho refused to acknowledge aiid to\n\nrespect his status as a neutral. For the purpose of ascertaining\n\nwhether the local remedies have been exhausted or whcther no\n\nrerneclies existed which promised effective redress, it is therefore\n\nsufficient to establish, on the basis of the legislation in force in\n\nGuatemala, that no reasonable espectation could be entertained\n\nby Mr. Notlebohm of obtaining esemption or relief from the rncas-\n\nures taken against him on the ground that he was a iiational of a\n\nneiitral State.\n\n54. It is in these circumstanccs doubtful whether the alleged non-\n\neshaustion oflocal remedies by &Ir.Nottebohm can be a ground of\n\ninadmissibility at all. For ~rliercthe applicant State rests its case,\n\nnot upon allegations of thc failure of the judicial or administrative\n\nauthorities of the respondeilt State to correct the \\r7rongcomplaiiled\n\nof, but upon a wrong which, if proved, is initially a breach of inter-\n\nriatioiial law, the plea of non-exhaustioii of local rernedies becomes\n\na matter of défencefor the respondent State. It goes not to admis-\n\nsibility, but to the merits. For in the first case-thc allegation of\n\nfailure of the judicial or administrative power in the State to correct\n\nthe wrong-the breach of international Jaw is not complete until the I\n\nhighest authority has had a reasonable opportunity to act. But in\n\nthe seconclcase the breach is complete when the wrong is donc and,\n\nif proved, the international claim in respect of it is established.\n\nunless the respondent Statc cail show that local remedies were not\n\ncshausted, that is tosay in effect, that it \\vas given no opportuiiittocorrect the wrong in its own ivay and through its own municipal\n\nagents. Therefore, in such a case, which is also the present case, the\n\nplea of the non-cxhaustion of the local remedies goes to the merits\n\nand nol to the admissibility.\n\nThere is a further consideration. The preserit citsc is referred to the\n\nCourt under Article 36 (2) of thc Statute, and ricithet this nor the\n\nGuatemalaii atid Liechtenstein declarations accepting the jurisdic-\n\ntion of thc Court contain any reservation of the exhaustion of local\n\nremedies. For the case where the Court's jurisdiction is accepted\n\nunconditionally \"the Court's compulsory jurisdiction, if al1 the\n\nremedies affordecl by the national courts have iiot heen exhaustcd,\n\nconstituteç a prorogation of jurisdiction ;the Court is competent\n\ne\\*en before cshaustion of local remedies\" :Ya?teuezys-Saldz~tiskis\n\nRniiway Case [rg3g] P.C.I.J. Ser. A/B, No. 76, at pp. 33, 39 per\n\nJudge Eysiiiga dissenting. It is suggested that the real ground of\n\ndifference betwceii Judge Eysinga and the Permanent Court lay in\n\nthe question whether the alleged hreach of international law by\n\nLithuania was complete, regard being had to the property and con-\n\ntractilal rights which feIl in the view othe Court \"morc particularly\n\nwithi~i the jurisdiction of municipal tribunals\". In other words, the\n\nCourt woi~ldnot have disagreed with Judge Eysinga's dictum just\n\ncited but have said that it did not apply in the case before them\n\nbecause the hreach was not complete so as to found an international\n\nclaim at all.\n\n~Vatzrreof the Remedies\n\njj. It inay also be asked whether the procedures, \\$+hichthe\n\nGuatemalan Government says were available to Blr.Nottebohm to\n\nobtain relief from the measures taken against him, did not by their\n\niiumher and coinplexity make them iiieffective as remedies and\n\n1-ender the riile as to exhaustion of local remedies inapplicable here.\n\nIndeed, so uncertain is the Government of Guatemala of the\n\nprecise scopc and applicability of these remedies that it charges\n\nMr. Nottebohm \\\\rith having failed to have had recourse to legal\n\nremedies in the main praceedings (henceforth called Proceedings qG)\n\ntouchirig the great hulk of his property (Proceedings 46 ; Mernorial\n\nAnnex j, para. 7ff.).et,until to-day, 110decision has been given upon\n\nthe opposition filed on 3 July 1946 (Countermcmorial, para. 56)and\n\nno appeal cari be lodged.\n\nThe Government of Liechtenstein will gi1.ea further short illus-\n\ntration of this u~icertainty. The proceedings regarding the estates\n\nof hlorazan and Guataibn (hlemorial Annex j, paras. 46, 48, 49 ;\n\nA~i~iex22 of thc prescnt Reply) were conducted twice in circurnstan-\n\nces which cannot but surprise the Court. These two properties were\n\nespropriated by a11order of 20 August 1945 (Annex 22, p. 471).\n\n1111950 the Guatemalan authorilies discovered that the order\n\nof expropriation had been wrongly made agaiilst Nottebohm\n\nBrothers, for iii fact the properties called Morazân and Guataloiiwere owned bjfhlr. F. Nottebohm and &Ir. K. H. Kottebohm in\n\ncommon. Therefore neiv cspropriation proceedings (henceforth\n\ncalled Proceediiigs 109) ïvere heguii on 26 May 19jo (Aiiiies 22.\n\npp, 477, 492 and 493), this time against the real registered\n\nowners. Meanwhile, an \"opposition\" had been filed on 3 .fuly\n\n1946 in the main Proceedings 46 (Mernorial Anncs j, para. 7)\n\nagainst the expropriation of these two properties. Owing to the\n\ninitiation of new expropriation proceedings certified copies of the\n\nrelevant documents in the main Proceedings 46 were made and sub-\n\nmitted in the new proceedings. One of these copies conccrned the\n\npower of attorney which &Ir.Friedrich Nottebohm had giveii to\n\nMr. K. H. Xottebohim (2Iemorial Annex j, para. 16). A certified\n\ncopy of this power of attorney \\{?ason the file of the main proceed-\n\nings. In the end a decision was rendered on 18 or 20 Decembcr 1951\n\n(Annex 22, pp. 502-504)which dismisseclMr.Kottebohin's oppositio~i\n\npartly on the rnerits and partly on the ground thatthe certified copy\n\nof the power of attorney in the new Proceedings rog was inadmis-\n\nsible. The reason given was that it was a ceriified copy ofa certified\n\ncopy. lihile the latter was admissible in the main Proceedings 46, it\n\nwas not admissible in the new Proceedings log.\n\nThus the Governmént of Guatemala could rc-opeil p;ocecding~\n\nin disregard of a previous decisioi;and, by starting new proceedings\n\naiid by opening a netv hlc it could hope to rid itself on a technicality\n\nof an awkward oppoilent ïvho could not.plead his case in person,\n\niiot having been &-admitted to the coiintry.\n\nB. The Posi/io?r bejo~e1946\n\nDate of Meas.z&rec so~a~lairzedoj\n\n56. The Governmerit of Guatemala contends that the local\n\nremedies were not exhausted, but fails to state ad whal date, by\n\nwhom whatremedies sllo~ildhave been employed. In the first place,\n\nit is necessary for the aggrieved party tn have hnd knowledge\n\nof the form and date of the incasure against which hc is required\n\nto seek relief. As will he show~i, Iilr. Nottebohm and the holder\n\nof his power of attorney were interncd in the United States during\n\nthe greater part of the period when the measures of expropriation\n\nwere being taken. In thcsc circurnstances the Government of\n\nLiechtenstein as ivell as hlr. Nottebohrn have labourcd under\n\nconsiderable difficulties in trying to ascertain the character and\n\ndate of the relevaiit measures. The Government of Guatemala\n\nhas made a small contribution (Counterrnemorial, para. 751,but\n\nit has not discharged the hurden incumbent upon it to show that\n\nat tire materiBi limes &Ir. Nottebohm could have emyloyed any\n\nof the rernedies to which it refers. In view of the absence from\n\nthe country of Afr. Nottebohm and of his legal reprcçentative,\n\nthe failure of the Governtneiit of Guatemala to specify eithcr\n\nthe dates when the ineasures were taken or thc remcdies ivhicli398 REPLY OF THE GOVERS3lEST OF LIECHTE?I'STEIN(14YI154)\n\nshould in its view have been exhausted, constitutesa failure to\n\nsubstantiate the allegation that theavailableremedies were not\n\nexhausted. In order to be exhausted a remedy must not only\n\nbe amilable in abstracto.It must have been efiectivelavailable\n\nto the aggrieved person at the time when the measure complained\n\nof was taken (see Moore, International Arbitrations, Ipp. 3157\n\n(John TV. Carmalt Case), 3158(M. J. Perry Case)).\n\nDate oj Segzlestrtktion\n\n57, As far as can be ascertained the sequestrabionof the coffee\n\nproduction and its proceeds took place between 9 October 1941\n\nand S Novernber 1941, The land itself came under sequestration\n\nbetween June 1942 and August 1942. Xo dates are available as\n\nregards the sequestration of the urban properties, except that\n\nthe Casa Grande in Quetzaltenango was apparently placed under\n\nsequester as late as13 hlarch 1946 (Annex zo,col. 5).\n\nDate of Ex$roprialion\n\njS. The expropriation of Mr. Kottebohm's immovable property\n\nwas carried out largely bet~veen August1944 and December 1945\n\n(Annex 20,col. 6). It may be that the plantations hlediodfa and\n\nLos Brillanteswere espropriated after that date, i.e. in February\n\n1948 and February 1947 reçpectively (Countermemorial, para751,\n\nalthough there is some evidencc that aii \"opposition\" was lodged,\n\niilthe case of Los Brillantesas early as 3 July1946 (Mernorial,\n\nXnnex 5,para. 7)and in thecaseof Mediodia on 28November 1946\n\n(ibid A.,nex 5,para. 40) .t would appear that Los Brillante\\vas\n\nexpropriated on 19 February 1947, or, at any rate, afte4 Sep-\n\ntember 1945. The plantation Carmen Metzabal may have been\n\nespropriated on 4 March 1947. The Casa Grande in Quetzal-\n\ntenango was expropriated on g June 1946,and some of the urban\n\nproperties on 9 June 1945.\n\n-4s mentioned before (55),the plantations Guatalon and MorazAn\n\nwere twice subject to expropriation ordcrs, first1945and again\n\nin 1950 (Proceedings109).\n\nIn so far as it is possible to nscertain, the shares held by\n\n>Zr.Xottebohm were espropriated in June 1945. The dates are\n\nnot available of the expropriation of his deposit-account. Certain\n\nblocked deposits appear to have been expropriated 21 June 1950,\n\nbut it is not certain whether they included the incarne from the\n\nsequestered estates which \\vas expropriated in virtue of Legislative\n\nDecree 258 of 28 June 19.15.\n\nTime foropposzngmeasliresof :\n\n(iSequestrafion\n\n59.

Any clairns which are made in the present proceedings\n\nanse indirectly, in that the Government of Liechtenstein contends\n\nthat the'Government of Guatemala failed to administer the estates\n\naccording to good husbandry, and has failed to nain tainthe income\n\nthcrefrom or to account for it.\n\nThis income was to be paid into a blocked account with the\n\nBank of Guatemala. It included-\n\n(i) the proceeds of the sale of coffee (Goverilmental Decree\n\nNo. 2601, art.2 ;Countermernorial, Annex 22);\n\n(ii) the bank deposit accounts (Legislative Uecree No. 2655,\n\nart. 18 ; Countcrrnemorial, Annex 25), including those repre-\n\nseriting payn~eiits made by debtors of Mr. Nottebohm and\n\nof his firm (Governmental Decree No. 2702, art. I ;Corintcr-\n\nmemonal, ilniiex 26) ;\n\n(iii) the income from the land sequestered in virtue of Goveril-\n\nmental Decrees Nos. 27S9 and 2791 (Countermemorial,\n\nAnnex 27).\n\nThe Government of Liechtenstein bases its clairn to compensation\n\non the fact that the income from these sequestered estates was\n\n, expropriated in virtue of Legislative Decree No. 258 (Counter-\n\nmernorial, Annex 36, see below para.66). Thus the fact of seqiiestra-\n\ntion and the charge of maladministration are only material to the\n\nmeasure and quantum of the damages which are claimed on the\n\nground of the subsequent expropriation. The question xvhether\n\nlocal .semedies were exhausted is limited to these and other acts\n\nof expropriation.\n\n(ii)Ezpropriatiotz\n\n60. As sho~vn above (5S), the expropriation of the plantatioiis\n\nin which Mr. Xottebohm had an interest was carried out for the\n\nmost part between August 1944 and Uecernber 1945 . I. Notte-\n\nbohm was interned on 19 November 1943and immediately deported\n\nto the United States. Mr. Karl Heinz Nottebohm, who held his\n\npower of attorney dated 17March1939(Mernorial,Annex 5,para.16 ;\n\nAnnex 6, para. 17), had been interned and deported previously.\n\nIn these circumstances, Alr. Xottebohm was physicaliy prevented\n\nfrom appearing in any proceedings (seeProceedings ~og; -4nnex 22,\n\np. 475), lodging any apyeals and fram exhausting the local\n\nremedies, if any (see helow paras. 68-111) N.or until he and\n\nMr. Karl Heinz Nottebohm were released, early in1946, could the\n\nquestion arise whether any remedies were still available. Conse-\n\nquently, the question is irrelevant whether and if so what remedies\n\nshould have been exhausted before 1946in the expropriation procced-\n\nings affectiiig &Ir.F. Nottebohm's assets. The existence oan uriex-\n\nhausted remedy signifies nothing if there was rio person \\\\*hounder\n\nthe local laxvnras capable of pursuing that remedy (above para. 56). 61. The Government of Guatemala refers to an additional\n\npower of attorney, granted on 19 Febniary 1942 o the Licenciado\n\nCarlos Salazar Gatica by Mr. Nottebohm (Countermcmorial,\n\n-4nnex 45). It ivill be noted, horveirer, that this power of attorney\n\nconcerns the representation of the firm of Nottebohm Brothers\n\nand not of hlr. Xottebohm in his private matters. Thus Mr. Notte-\n\nbohm remained unrepresented, quite apart from the fact that\n\nsiihsequently llr. Salazar Gatica became persona non gratu with\n\nthe Government of Giiaternala and \\vas forced to leave the country.\n\n62. The Government of Liechtensteiii submits that, in respect\n\nof mensures (if expropriation carried out hetween 1944 and 1946,\n\nthc plea that the local remedies have not been exhausted must\n\nfail. Owing to the policy of arrest and deportation practised by\n\nthe Governrnent of Guatemala there ivas no person who under\n\nthe local law was capable of pursuing any remedy on behalf of\n\nMr. Xottebohm.\n\nExhaitstio~zoj Local Ke~nedies t~$oitthe retirrof Mr. K.

On the other hand, by withholding any decision \\\\:hich\n\nwas not exclusively based on the merits, it soiight to precllide the\n\nGovernment of Liechtenstein as long as possihlc from any lawful\n\ncornplaint against thc application of the esprol)riatioil legislntioii\n\nto the property of Mr. Nottebohm.\n\n76.

This procedure was examined above (paras. 67-72).In so far as\n\nthe main Proceedings 46 are concerned, notice of opposition was\n\nlodged in accordance with Articles 36, 43,44 and 47 of the Legisla-\n\ntivc Dccrec 630, but no decision urasgiven at any time.

The first legislativc nicasiire of cspropriatiois to be found\n\niiiGovernmental Decree 3115 of 22 June 1944 (Countermernorial,\n\nArmes 28). This al~plied to al1 pcrsons of Germa11nationality who,\n\nou7ingto their fina~icialinfluence constituted a latent danger for the\n\nRepiiblic or for the security of the western hemisphere (Art1).The\n\nCovernrnental Dccree 30. 3134 of 14 August 1944, Article I (Coun-\n\ntermernorial, Annes 30), extended expropriation to the propertyluf\n\npersons on the Black List q~id of al1 cnemy nationals within the\n\n~neaniiig of Governmental llecree Eo. 26j5 of 23 December 1941.\n\nArt. 40 (Countermemorial, Annes 25). This included al1nationals of\n\ncountries at war with Guatemala or thosc who were linked hy legal\n\nor political tiesvith the i~istitritions or officiai agencies of cnernj.\n\ncoulitries. -411thcsc decrees were enacted during the absence of\n\nMr. F. Xottebohm and of his legal represt:ntative in the U.S.A.\n\n'TheLegislative Decree Xo. rIq of 16 May 1945, Art. g (Countcr-\n\nmernorial, Annes 351, restricted thc right to lodge \"op~iositions\".\n\n0ii1y persons who were not on the Black List at the time of the\n\nIlecree or were not nationals of any of the countries at war with thc\n\nUnited Nations, were to erijoy tlie right to Iodge an \"opposition\".\n\nprovided, inter alia, that they had never dcalt with persons or lepl\n\nentities on the Black List and could prove that they had never been\n\nsuspected of any activities detrimental to the democracies. Al1\n\nthese measures were consolidated by the Legislative Decree No. 630\n\nof 13 July 1949 (Countermemorial, Annex 39),which is the Dccree\n\nciirectly in issue here, seeing that the decision in Proceedings ~og\n\n\\ras given in December rggr.\n\nLegislative Decree Aio. 630\n\n83. According to Art. 7 (a) and (c) ofthis Decree, as amended\n\nb; the Legislative Decree No. 689, Art. 3 [Countermemorial,\n\n-4nnex 40), enemy property included al1 propert~r owned inter\n\nalin by :\n\n(i) yersonç or entities who, on 7 October 1938, were natioiials\n\nof a country with which Guatemala had beeii at war, notwith-\n\nstanding that such persons claimed that they had acquired\n\nanother nationality after 7 October 1938 (Art. 7 (a));\n\n(ii) persons or legal entities on the Guatemala11 Black List\n\n(art.7 (c)).\n\nIncluded among Germans,, for this purpose, were all pcrsons\n\nwho, after 7 October 1938, had used a German passport or had REPLY OF THE GOI~EUSJIEST OF LIECHTESSTEIK (14 VI1 54) 407\n\ndescribed themselves as Germans in an officia1document (Legis-\n\nlative Decree 689, Art. 3 amending Art. IO of the Decree Xo. 630).\n\nThe Governmeiit of Guatemala therefore rcgarded a German\n\npassport as conclusive evidence of German nationality while the\n\nsame Goveriiment objects to a Liechtenstein passport as cvidence\n\nof Liechtcnstciii nationality.\n\n84. Exemytioi~ from the operation of this Ilec~ee could be\n\ngranted under Article 17 to those who could show that, although\n\nthey fell jvithiii the groups defined in Article 7 (a) and (c),\n\ninter alza, they Iiad been permanent117 domicilcd in Guatemala\n\nsince 1933 and were still so domiciled at the time of the Decree\n\n{i.e. on 13 July 1949) and had not been absent from Guatemala\n\ncontinually for more than two years l.\n\nSj. Mr. Nottebohm had been a German national on 7 October\n\n1938 ;his name figured on the Black List and hc waç no longer\n\ndomici1ed in Guatemala on 13 July 1949, but in Liechtenstein.\n\nThese facts wcre uncontroversial. Thus he fell bvithin the ambit\n\nof Article 7 fa) and (c) and, by reason of his inclusion within\n\nthe class defined in 7 (c), he could not claim the yrivileges of\n\nexemption iinder Article 17 of the Decree 630. Nor could any\n\ndoiibts ariçe whether the.Decree 630 was applicable in the particular\n\ncircumstances of his case. The Decree is unambiguous. In the\n\nface of uncontroversial facts, which attracted unqueçtionably the\n\napplication of Decrce 630, no appeal to the Administrative Court\n\nor to the Supreme Court on the ground that he was a national\n\nof Liechtenstein, a neutral State, could have çucceeded.\n\n86. The Govcrnment of Guatemala acknowlcclges this fact\n\nwhen it states :\n\n\"La régularité des expropriations faites iie parait pas pouvoir\n\nfaire de doute\" (Countermemorial, paras. 76, 77, 72).\n\n37. It is precisely in these circumstances that the rule recalled\n\nabove (para. 80) applies. In face of an enactrnent in unambiguous\n\nterms of the Articles 7 and IO of the Legislative Decree 630.\n\nno higher court could reverse the decision given in Proceedings 109.\n\nConsequently, $Ir. Xottebohm couid not be reqiiired to exhaust\n\nthe remedy of further appeals prescribed by -4rticle47 of the\n\nsame decree.\n\nThe substance of the cornplaint lodged hy the Government\n\nof Liechtenstein is, therefore, not that Articles 7 and IO of the\n\nDecree 630 were wrongly applied, but that provisions of this\n\nkind were enacted a,t al1 by the Government of Guatemala. For\n\nby including in the statutory definition of an enemy, for the\n\n1The Government of Guatemala,havingexpellcd ;\\Ir.

Precedents\n\n88. Vainly does the Government of Guatemala attempt to show,\n\nby citing and reproducing the decisions of the Administrative Court\n\nand of the Supreme Court in the matter of Carmen Nottebohm\n\nStoltz (Countermemorial, Annexes jo and 51) that an appeal might\n\nhave met with a substantial measure of success. For Carmen Notte-\n\nbohm Stoltz was a national of Guatemala and was not a national\n\nof..any neutral or enemy country at any relevant time. Nor did\n\nshe come within the ambit of any other provision of Article 7 of\n\nDecree No. 630. Having regard to these facts, the Legislative\n\nDecree No. 630 was clearly inapplicable t,o her.\n\n89. But even if the wording of Articles7 and IO of the Legislative\n\nDecree 630 had permitted the conclusion that an appeal could have\n\nbeen lodged with a reasonable expectation of success, a further\n\nobstacle presented itself. Article47 of the 1-egislative Decree 630\n\nrequired the deposit varying from zoo to 2,000 Quetzales,according\n\nto the discretionary order of the Court,..before an appeal to the\n\nSupreme Court of Cassation could be admitted. This sum was to be\n\nforfeited if the appeal failed. This penal provision must be regarded\n\nas a potential, but none the less effective, bar tothe filing of appeals.\n\nThis sum is al1 the more prohibitive where the proceedings involve\n\nobjects of small value. Proceedings 109, which are the only proceed-\n\nings in which this appeal could have been lodged, concerned onIy\n\nthe plantations Guatalbn and Morazh, the combined value of\n\nwhich amounted to 18,000 Quetzales.\n\nPlea ofViolation oj the Co?zstitutio~z\n\ngo. In view of these considerations, the requirement that al1local\n\nremeclies must have been exhausted could not ordinady be insisted\n\nupon. The rule of international law waiving thiç requirement (above\n\npara. 80) where the decision complained of has been given in pur-\n\nsuance of an unambigilous rnuilicipal enactment with the result that\n\nthere is no likelihood of a higher tribunal reversing the decision,\n\napplies without douht. However, in the present case the matter does\n\nnot rest here.\n\n91. Article ryo of the Constitution of 1945 provides (Coontcr-\n\nmernorial, .4nnex 15) :\n\n\"The Courts are competent to give judgrnents and to order levy\n\nof execution of their judgments and to watch over the application\n\nof the laws in al1spheres which fa11within their jurisdiction. The\n\nordinary courts and the administrative court may, in individual REPLP OF THE GOVERSMEKT OF LIECHTESSTEIS (14 VI1j4)405)\n\ncases, pronounce by way of judgments of first ancl second instance,\n\nand of cassation that any law or measure of the organs exercising\n\nthe other functions of government is inapplicable on the ground\n\nthat itviolütes the Constitution.\"\n\nSee also Article 55of the Constitution of 1879(Countermernorial,\n\nhnnes 14).\n\n92. It is self-evident that the enaçtment of a provision such as\n\nthat to be found iiiArticle170 of the Constitution of 1945 cannot\n\noust the rule of international law that the local remedies need riot\n\nbe exhausted if the statute is unambiguous and was correctly\n\napplied to the facts. Nor does Article 170 of the Constitution\n\neliminate the riilc (above paras. 52, 53) that, where the claim is\n\npredicated on the ground of an initial breach of international law,\n\nthe questiorz whethcr the local remedics have been exhausted must\n\nbe ascertained solely with reference to the sliegations advanced\n\nby tlie claimant's State.Irishort, the forma1 existence of a remedjr\n\ncannot avail the rcspondent State if the facts of the case and thc\n\nteiior of the enactment which was applied exclude any reasonablc\n\nexpectatiori that the decision comylained of can be reversecl on the\n\nground that >Ir. Nottebohm \\vas a national of Liechtenstein, a\n\niieutral Statc.\n\n93. This principle is as valid where the appeal is based on the\n\nground that the Constitiition has-been violated as it is vaiid wheii\n\nin normal circumstances the appeal allcges that the la~vhas been\n\nmisconstrucd, or has been wrongly applicd to the facts (above,\n\nparas. jz, 53). 111short, an appeal on the grouiid that the Consti-\n\ntution has been violated must be attcnded hy a reasonable expec-\n\ntation that the clccisioncomplained ofcan bc rcversed on theground\n\nof the particular allegations advanced by the claimant's State.\n\nConversel!?,the existence of a clear rulc of the Coristitution sanction-\n\ning a measure of the kind which is prima facie applicable, or the\n\nabsencc of a rule prohibiting it, must rule out the need to appeai\n\non the grountl that the Constitution is violated.\n\nRelevunt Provisions O/ (he ConsIifzrtio?r\n\n94. Tt follows froin the foregoing that iiithe preseiit case the\n\nyroblem whether the legislation concerning the expropriation of\n\neiiemy property is compatible with the Constitution can only\n\narise in connectioii ivith two questions :\n\n(i) ivhether the Coiistitrition of Guatemala permits or prohibits\n\nthe expropriation, iii time of war, of the property of neutral\n\nnationals, ori the ground that they are criemies according to\n\nGuatemalaii law ;\n\n(ii) does the Coiistitution of Guatemala establish the priinacy of\n\ninternational law (like, for instance, -4rticle25 of the German 410 REPLY OF THE COVERSUEST OF LIECWTESSTEIS (14\\'II54)\n\nConstitutioii of 1949) ? If it did, it ïvoiild folloïv that the\n\nlegislation espropriating neutral nationals in time of \\var on\n\nthe grouiid that they are enemg:aliens according to Guatemalari\n\nlaw, uroiild be invalid on the ground that it is contrary to\n\ninternational Inw.\n\n95. The rclcvant provision of the Coiistitutioii of 1945 is Arti-\n\ncle92 (Cuui~tcrinemorial, Annex r5), which superseded Article 28\n\nof the Constitution of 1879 (Countermemorial, Annex 14).\n\n-4fter providing that private property may oiily be espropriated\n\nagairist previous payrneiit of an inde~nnity for public purposes\n\n(Art.92 of thc iicu'Constitution;ZSof the old Constitution) or for\n\nsocial puryoscs proïred according to Iaw (Art. 92 of the iiew Consti-\n\n. tution), both Constitutions deal tvith espropriatioii in tiine of urar.\n\n96. The Constitution of 1879 merely stated that in time of war\n\nno previous indemnity nced be paid, \\Vhile retaining this rule as a\n\ngeneral principle, the Constitution of 1945 üdded, in Article 92 :\n\n\"In case of war, enemy property may he sequestered and, if\n\nexpropriated, paymcnt of an indemnity may bc postponed until\n\nthe date \\vheii the war is ended. The procedure of espropriatiori\n\ndshallbe determined by a law.\"\n\n97. The prohleni is, therefore, whether Articles 7 (a) and (c),\n\nro and 17 of the Legislative Decrec 630 of 13 July 1949, which\n\nprovided the legal basis of the decision in Proceedings 109, violate\n\nA"
