His knowledge of German, he notes, was particularly helpful in getting hired for his current position.\n\nToday, Sina feels particularly fortunate to work on the front lines of critical issues shaping international criminal law, from how to deal with war crimes in Syria and Myanmar to how to hold any country accountable for an act of aggression against another. In fact, Liechtenstein has taken the lead in efforts to resolve some unfinished business from the Nuremberg trials, and Sina says he has been privileged to work with legendary Nuremberg prosecutor Ben Ferencz, now 99 years old, who convicted 22 Nazis for the murder of 80,000 Jews. “He’s really inspirational,” Sina said. “Today, with global tensions on the rise, it’s interesting to speak to someone who saw far, far worse.”\n\nSina hopes his work today may help the world “make sure we’re not on a slippery slope to do something worse again.”"
