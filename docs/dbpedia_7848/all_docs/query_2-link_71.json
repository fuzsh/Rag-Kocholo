        "text": "What types of companies exist in Liechtenstein?\n\nLiechtenstein, despite its modest size, is an attractive jurisdiction for international business due to its economic stability, favorable tax system and flexible corporate legislation. The country offers a variety of forms of companies, each of which has its own characteristics and advantages. In this article, we will look at the key types of companies available for registration in Liechtenstein.\n\nJoint Stock Company (Aktiengesellschaft, AG)\n\nA joint-stock company (AG) is one of the most popular forms of business in Liechtenstein, suitable for large projects and international activities. The minimum authorized capital is 50,000 Swiss francs, of which 100% must be paid at registration. AG provides shareholders with limited liability to the extent of their contribution to the share capital.\n\nLimited Liability Company (Gesellschaft mit beschrbeschrgnkter Haftung, GmbH)\n\nGmbH is the preferred choice for small and medium-sized enterprises that require a smaller share capital compared to AG. The minimum authorized capital is 30,000 Swiss francs. The liability of participants is limited to their share of investments in the authorized capital. A GmbH is required to have at least one manager, who must be a resident of Liechtenstein.\n\nPartnership (Limited company, CO and Collective company, KG)\n\nA partnership in Liechtenstein can be arranged either as a limited partnership (CO) or as a collective partnership (CG). These forms of businesses are ideal for family businesses or small partner projects. In a limited partnership, one or more partners are fully responsible, while others have limited liability. A collective society requires all partners to be jointly and fully responsible for the company’s obligations.\n\nTrust (Treuh&nderschaft)\n\nLiechtenstein is known for its trust structures that offer a high level of privacy and asset protection. A Liechtenstein trust allows the founder to transfer assets to a trustee, who then manages those assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. Trusts are widely used for inheritance planning and asset protection.\n\nAnstalt\n\nAnstalt is a unique form of company in Liechtenstein, which can be used for commercial activities or private asset management. This is a legal entity with elements of both a joint-stock company and a foundation. Anstalt may issue shares if this is provided for in its articles of association, but it may also be owned by one person. This form is popular among international investors for asset management and investment.\n\nFoundation (Stiftung)\n\nFoundations in Liechtenstein are usually established for long-term asset management, inheritance planning, and charitable purposes. Funds can enjoy tax benefits, depending on their structure and purpose. The minimum authorized capital depends on the purpose of the fund and can start from 30,000 Swiss francs.\n\nConclusion\n\nLiechtenstein offers a wide range of corporate structures that meet the needs of international investors and local entrepreneurs. Choosing the right form of company depends on a variety of factors, including business volume, tax considerations, privacy requirements, and asset management. Due to the complexity of legislation and tax regimes, it is recommended to consult with professionals to select the optimal corporate structure in Liechtenstein.\n\nWhat is the size of the company’s authorized capital in Liechtenstein?\n\nLiechtenstein, known for its attractive business environment, flexible corporate structures and favorable tax treatment, offers various forms of legal entities for doing business. The size of the authorized capital is one of the key aspects when registering a company. In this article, we will look at the minimum authorized capital requirements for various types of companies in Liechtenstein.\n\nJoint Stock Company (AG)\n\nA joint-stock company (Aktiengesellschaft, AG) in Liechtenstein has a minimum authorized capital of 50,000 Swiss francs (CHF). This capital must be paid in full at the time of incorporation of the company. AG allows its shareholders to limit their liability to the size of their contributions to the company’s capital.\n\nLimited Liability Company (GmbH)\n\nFor a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbH), the minimum authorized capital is CHF 30,000. In contrast to an AG, where the capital is divided into shares, the members of a GmbH invest their shares in the company, which also limits their liability to the amount of their investment.\n\nLimited Company (Kommanditgesellschaft, KG)\n\nA limited company in Liechtenstein does not have a strictly defined minimum authorized capital. KG has at least one limited liability investor whose liability is limited to their contribution to the company’s capital, and one full partner who has unlimited liability.\n\nCollective company (Kollektivgesellschaft, KG)\n\nThere is also no minimum amount of authorized capital for a collective company. All partners in a KG are jointly and unlimitedly liable for the company’s obligations, which makes this form of company less popular among investors seeking to limit their liability.\n\nAnstalt\n\nAnstalt is a corporate form unique to Liechtenstein that can function as a commercial organization or a holding company for asset management. The minimum authorized capital for an anstalt is set individually, depending on the structure and purpose of the company, but is often CHF 30,000.\n\nFoundation (Stiftung)\n\nFor a foundation (Stiftung), the minimum authorized capital can also vary, but is usually CHF 30,000. Foundations are often used for asset management, inheritance and charitable purposes, offering tax benefits and a high level of confidentiality.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Liechtenstein, there are a variety of forms of companies, each of which has its own requirements for the authorized capital. The choice of the appropriate form depends on a variety of factors, including the scope of activities, strategic goals, and the desired level of responsibility and confidentiality. Given the complexity and importance of these decisions, potential investors are encouraged to seek advice from qualified lawyers and financial consultants in Liechtenstein.\n\nShould a company in Liechtenstein have a local director?\n\nLiechtenstein, thanks to its economic stability, attractive tax policies and flexible corporate legislation, is a popular destination for doing international business. One of the key issues facing foreign investors when registering a company in Liechtenstein is the requirement to have a local director. Let’s take a closer look at when a company in Liechtenstein needs to appoint a local director, and what are the responsibilities and roles of such a director.\n\nRequirements for the Appointment of a Local Director\n\nIn Liechtenstein, the law stipulates that some forms of companies must have a local director or manager who is a resident of the country. This requirement most often applies to legal entities such as a joint-stock company (AG) and a limited liability company (GmbH).\n\nRole of the Local Director\n\nThe local director plays an important role in the management of the company, ensuring that it meets local legal and tax requirements. They can act as the company’s representative to government agencies, banks, and other institutions. In addition, having a local director can facilitate more effective communication and administrative tasks.\n\nResponsibilities of the Local Director\n\nThe local director is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the company and ensuring that its operations comply with national legislation. Its responsibilities include:\n\nMaintaining the legality of the company’s activities.\n\nManage financial transactions and comply with tax obligations.\n\nProvision of annual reports and other reports to regulatory authorities.\n\nAdvantages of Appointing A Local Director\n\nHaving a local director has several advantages:\n\nImproves the perception of the company as a local business entity, strengthening the trust of local partners and customers.\n\nProvides prompt resolution of administrative and legal issues.\n\nPromotes a better understanding of the local business climate and market conditions.\n\nHow To Find A Local Director\n\nForeign companies can find a local director through specialized agencies that provide corporate services, or through recommendations from business partners in Liechtenstein. It is important to choose a candidate with the appropriate experience and reputation, who can be trusted to manage the company.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe appointment of a local director is an important step for companies seeking to do business in Liechtenstein. This not only complies with local legislation, but also provides strategic advantages in the management of the company. However, choosing the right local director requires a thorough approach and understanding of their role and responsibilities in the context of your business.\n\nWhat is the amount of state fees when setting up a company in Liechtenstein?\n\nLiechtenstein attracts entrepreneurs from all over the world with its stable economy, attractive tax system and flexible corporate structures. However, as in any other jurisdiction, the establishment of a company here is associated with certain state fees. In this article, we will take a detailed look at what the state fees are when setting up different types of companies in Liechtenstein, so that you can effectively plan your initial costs.\n\nGeneral information about State Fees\n\nState fees are mandatory payments levied by the state for registering a company, as well as for performing certain legal actions and providing various services. The amount of these fees may vary depending on the type of company, its authorized capital, and other factors.\n\nJoint Stock Company (AG)\n\nFor a joint-stock company (AG) in Liechtenstein, the State registration fee is determined in proportion to the authorized capital. At the time of writing, the minimum fee is around 1,000 Swiss francs (CHF) for companies with a registered capital of up to 50,000 CHF. For companies with large authorized capital, the fee may be significantly higher.\n\nLimited Liability Company (GmbH)\n\nFor a limited liability company (GmbH), state fees also depend on the authorized capital, but in general they are lower than for AG. The minimum fee for setting up a GmbH is usually around 600-800 CHF.\n\nPartnerships (KG and KG)\n\nFor limited and collective partnerships (KG and CG), government fees are usually lower, as these forms of companies are less complex to establish and manage. Fees may vary from 300 to 500 CHF.\n\nAnstalt and the Foundation (Stiftung)\n\nThe establishment of an anstalt or foundation (Stiftung) in Liechtenstein is accompanied by the payment of fees, the amount of which may vary significantly depending on the specifics and goals of the organization being established. On average, the fee can range from 1,000 to 2,000 CHF.\n\nAdditional Fees\n\nIn addition to the basic state fees, additional fees must also be taken into account, such as notary fees, registration fees in the commercial register and legal services costs. These fees can significantly increase the total cost of setting up a company.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe amount of state fees for establishing a company in Liechtenstein varies depending on the type of company and its authorized capital. It is important to consider all possible costs in advance to ensure effective budget planning when launching your business. We recommend that you contact professional legal and financial consultants in Liechtenstein for up-to-date information and assistance in the company registration process.\n\nWhat is the annual cost of servicing a company in Liechtenstein?\n\nLiechtenstein is known as one of the most attractive jurisdictions for international business due to its stable economy, favorable tax system and strategic location in Europe.

With its stable economy, favorable tax system and flexible corporate legislation, Liechtenstein offers many business benefits. Let’s look at the main ones.\n\nA Favorable Tax System\n\nLiechtenstein is famous for its attractive tax policies. Companies registered in Liechtenstein can benefit from the low corporate tax rate, which is only 12.5% of their net profit. In addition, there are no value-added taxes (VAT) for certain types of activities, and dividends and interest paid by the company can be exempt from taxation.\n\nPrivacy and Asset Protection\n\nLiechtenstein is known for its strict privacy laws, which ensure a high level of protection of information about company owners and directors. This makes the principality attractive for investors seeking to protect their assets and property information.\n\nPolitical and Economic Stability\n\nLiechtenstein is characterized by a high level of political stability and the absence of significant internal conflicts. The country’s economy is stable, with low unemployment and high GDP per capita. These factors create a favorable environment for business and investment.\n\nFlexible Corporate Legislation\n\nLiechtenstein’s corporate legislation is designed to provide flexibility and convenience for international businesses. The country offers various legal forms of companies, including unique structures such as anstalt and funds that can be adapted to the specific business models and goals of investors.\n\nHighly Qualified Workforce\n\nLiechtenstein offers access to a highly skilled workforce, thanks to the high level of education and professionalism of the population. In addition, local authorities actively support innovation and business development by offering various support and incentive programs.\n\nStrategic Geographical Location\n\nLocated in the heart of Europe, Liechtenstein provides companies with convenient access to markets in both Western and Eastern Europe. Its proximity to major economic centers such as Zurich and Munich makes it an ideal location for international business.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe establishment of a company in Liechtenstein offers a number of significant advantages, including a favorable tax system, confidentiality, economic and political stability, flexible corporate legislation, access to skilled labor, and a strategic geographical location.

This principality offers various ways to establish a company, taking into account the needs and goals of investors. In this article, we will look at the main ways to establish a company in Liechtenstein.\n\nDirect Registration\n\nDirect registration is the most straightforward way to establish a company in Liechtenstein. This process includes preparing and submitting the necessary documents to the Liechtenstein Commercial Register. The documents must include the company’s charter, list of directors and founders, proof of authorized capital, and other relevant documentation. Direct registration is suitable for investors who want to create a new company with a “clean slate”.\n\nPurchase of a Shelf Company\n\nFor investors looking for a quick entry to the market, buying a ready-made company, or”shelf company”, can be an ideal solution. These companies are already registered in Liechtenstein, but were not active. Buying such a company allows you to avoid the time and effort associated with the registration process of a new company, and provides an immediate legal address and a ready-made corporate structure.\n\nBespoke Incorporation\n\nThis method involves setting up a company in Liechtenstein according to the specific requirements and preferences of the investor. It includes the selection of the optimal corporate structure, the development of individual articles of association and other constituent documents, as well as the registration of the company in accordance with the personal or business goals of the investor. This method is ideal for large investments and complex corporate structures.\n\nThrough a Legal Entity or Trust\n\nInvestors can also set up a company in Liechtenstein through an existing legal entity or trust. This can be useful for creating complex financial structures, or for managing assets within a family business or inheritance planning. This method requires a thorough knowledge of Liechtenstein corporate and trust law.\n\nPartnership with a Local Entrepreneur\n\nSome activities may require a partnership with a local entrepreneur or company. This not only simplifies the process of registering and managing a company, but also provides a better understanding of the local market and legislation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe choice of how to establish a company in Liechtenstein depends on many factors, including business objectives, capital structure, the need for privacy, and the speed of market entry. In any case, the successful establishment and operation of a business in Liechtenstein requires careful planning and a thorough understanding of local legislation. It is recommended to contact qualified legal and financial consultants to ensure compliance with all requirements and optimize the registration process.\n\nDo I need to have a registered office in Liechtenstein?\n\nLiechtenstein, with its stable economy, attractive tax system and high level of privacy, is one of the leading jurisdictions for international business. One of the key requirements for establishing and operating a company in Liechtenstein is to have a registered office in the country. Let’s take a closer look at why a legal address is needed and what functions it performs.\n\nWhat is a Legal Address?\n\nLegal address is the official address of the company, which is used for state registration and correspondence.

This may be appropriate for companies that need a physical presence and workspace.\n\nVirtual Office Services: Many companies offer virtual office services, including providing a legal address, postal service, and phone numbers. This is a more cost-effective option for businesses that do not require a permanent physical presence.\n\nPartnership with a Local Entrepreneur: Some companies may choose to partner with local entrepreneurs or legal entities that provide their address as the company’s legal address.\n\nConclusion\n\nHaving a registered office in Liechtenstein is a prerequisite for all registered companies and plays a key role in their legitimacy, communication and operations. The choice of method of providing a legal address depends on the specifics and needs of the business, as well as on the available budget. In any case, having a registered office in Liechtenstein opens the company’s doors to the world of international business and finance.\n\nCan I open a branch of a foreign company in Liechtenstein?\n\nLiechtenstein, with its attractive tax policy and strategic location in Europe, is a desirable location for many international companies to expand their operations.

This process requires careful preparation and understanding of local legislation. We recommend that you seek the help of qualified legal and financial consultants to ensure that you meet all the requirements and optimize the registration process.\n\nCan a foreigner open a company in Liechtenstein?\n\nLiechtenstein, thanks to its attractive tax policy, strict confidentiality and convenient geographical location, is a prestigious jurisdiction for conducting international business.
