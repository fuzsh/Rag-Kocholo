We also have offices in Almaty, Brussels, Moscow and Vienna.\n\nThe UNEP Europe Office’s main goal is to provide guidance to national governments at various levels, and to take part in the dialogue on environmental issues between governmental authorities, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders. We encourage closer cooperation between the main actors in the region, implement projects and provide scientific and legal expertise on challenges facing Europe’s environment. We also undertake awareness-raising initiatives and campaigns, giving Europeans the chance to act towards a greener region while improving the quality of their lives.\n\nWe host the Geneva Environment Network, the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Tehran Convention) and the Framework Convention on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Carpathians (Carpathian Convention).\n\nWe also lead an Issue-Based Coalition (IBC) on Environment and Climate Change. IBCs see UN agencies coordinate their support to governments towards the Sustainable Development Goals. For more information — including on the COVID-19 response — click here.\n\n* All European Union member states, in addition to Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, the Holy See (Non member state, permanent observer to the UN), Iceland, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and Uzbekistan."
