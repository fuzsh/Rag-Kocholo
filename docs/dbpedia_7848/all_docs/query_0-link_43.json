        "text": "At a glance\n\nThe European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement brings Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (EEA EFTA countries) into the EU’s internal market, guaranteeing the freedom of movement for goods, services, people and capital, as well as unified related policies (competition, transport, energy, economic and monetary cooperation).\n\nThe same rules and conditions apply to all businesses within the EEA. EU legislation relating to the internal market is part of EEA countries’ legislation.\n\nWhat does the EEA Agreement cover?\n\nIn addition to the commitments that fall under the internal market and its related policies, the EEA Agreement ensures the three states’ participation in a number of EU programmes and agencies in the fields of:\n\nresearch and development (R&D)\n\neducation\n\nsocial policy\n\nenvironment\n\nconsumer protection\n\ntourism\n\nculture\n\nNorway, Iceland and Liechtenstein do not formally access the EU decision-making process. However, they are able to provide input during the preparatory phases. For example, they have the right to participate in expert groups, Commission committees and to submit comments on upcoming legislation to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement.\n\nWhat does the EEA Agreement not cover?\n\nThe EEA Agreement does not cover the following EU policies:\n\nCommon Agriculture and Fisheries Policies (although the Agreement contains provisions on various aspects of trade in agricultural and fish products);\n\nCustoms Union;\n\nCommon Trade Policy;\n\nCommon Foreign and Security Policy;\n\nJustice and Home Affairs (even though the EFTA countries are part of the Schengen area);\n\nthe Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).\n\nTrade in Goods\n\nThe EEA agreement provides for a high degree of trade liberalisation across most sectors. However, agriculture and fisheries are not covered by the EEA Agreement.\n\nAgricultural Products\n\nProtocol 3 to the EEA Agreement sets out a price compensation system for processed agricultural products. This system aims to compensate for the differences in prices of basic agricultural products within the EEA. It achieves this by granting subsidies on exports and levying customs duties on imports. The subsidies and customs duties are calculated on the basis of reference prices agreed by the Contracting Parties. Protocol 3 does not apply to Liechtenstein.\n\nFish\n\nThe EEA EFTA States do not take part in the Common Fisheries Policy of the EU. Iceland and Norway issue their own fishing quotas and retain certain restrictions on ownership and establishment in the fisheries sector.\n\nOn the basis of the EEA Agreement and additional bilateral agreements, customs duties on most types of white fish products have been abolished. There are, in addition, substantial reductions in customs duties for other fish and processed fish products. However, the EEA Agreement does not cater for reductions in the customs duties for some of the most important species in Iceland and Norway.\n\nHence, the EEA Agreement does not prevent the EU from applying safeguard measures, such as antidumping duties and countervailing measures, on fish products.\n\nTariffs\n\nAll products originating from the EEA, except certain fish and agricultural products and in accordance with the rules of origin, may be traded free of tariffs within the EEA.\n\nHowever, the EU and EEA EFTA countries apply different tariffs to imports from third countries.\n\nCheck the tariffs applying to your product in the My Trade Assistant\n\nRules of origin\n\nIn order for a product to obtain preferential treatment under the EEA Agreement, it has to originate in the EEA. The EEA Agreement therefore contains rules of origin that determine to what extent a product must be produced or processed within the EEA in order to obtain status as a product of EEA preferential origin.\n\nBefore you export/import, make sure that you:\n\nCheck the rules of origin applying to your product in the My Trade Assistant\n\nConsult your customs authorities.\n\nProduct requirements\n\nGoods can circulate freely between EU and the other EEA countries. Product requirements between EEA countries (including EU) are either:\n\nHarmonised and identical, because rules adopted at European level that apply throughout the EEA have replaced national product regulations. Therefore, goods can circulate without additional approval or testing.\n\nNon-harmonised but mutual recognition applies. Therefore, products lawfully marketed in one EEA State can be marketed in all other EEA States, even if the product does not fully comply with the technical rules of the importing EEA State.\n\nTechnical rules and requirements\n\nLearn about the technical requirements, rules and procedures that goods have to meet in order to be imported in the European Economic Area.\n\nSearch for the specific rules and regulations applicable to your product and its country of origin in the My Trade Assistant. To view requirements for your product you will first have to identify its customs code. If you do not know the customs code, you can search for it with your product's name in the built-in search engine.\n\nHealth and safety requirements SPS\n\nVeterinary and phytosanitary matters are covered by Annex I to the EEA Agreement and food legislation is covered by Chapter XII of Annex II. Legislation on food and veterinary matters do not apply to Liechtenstein, which, due to its customs union with Switzerland, applies the veterinary provisions laid down in the Swiss-EU Agreement on Agriculture.\n\nThe EU and the EEA EFTA States do not have fully harmonised legislation regarding plants. The EEA Agreement contains legislation regarding plant seeds, covered by Chapter III of Annex I (phytosanitary matters), with the exception of provisions relating to imports and border control.\n\nLearn about the health, safety, sanitary and phytosanitary standards that goods have to meet in order to be imported in the European Union.\n\nSearch for the health, safety and SPS rules applicable to your product and its country of origin in the My Trade Assistant. To view requirements for your product you will first have to identify its customs code. If you do not know the customs code, you can search for it with your product's name in the built-in search engine.\n\nCustom clearance documents and procedures\n\nThe EU Customs Union does not extend to Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland. Customs borders and procedures are still in place between these countries and the EU.\n\nFor some products considered as high risk, a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) is required to assess whether a product conforms to the applicable Product certification conducted by a CAB designated by one EEA State is recognised throughout the entire EEA.\n\nFind out about other custom clearance documents and procedures needed to import into the European Economic Area.\n\nIntellectual Property (IP) and Geographical Indications (GI)\n\nThe EEA Agreement contains harmonised provisions on IPR and ensures a high level of protection of industrial rights (inventions, designs, trademarks, etc) and copyright (music, films, print media, software, etc) in all EEA States.\n\nThe rules also contain the principle of regional exhaustion of IPR, applicable in the entire EEA. In practice, once a product has been placed on the market in the EEA by a right-holder (or with his consent), the latter can no longer rely on his exclusive right to prevent the importation of such products from another EEA State.\n\nBased on Article 65(2) of the EEA Agreement, intellectual property legislation is incorporated into Annex XVII. Nevertheless, not all EU initiatives in this field have been incorporated.\n\nFind out more about IP and GI legislation in the EU, as well as EU IPR policy towards trade.\n\nTrade in Services\n\nFind more information about the rules, regulations and facilities for trade in services\n\nPublic Procurement\n\nThe EEA Agreement established a single market in public procurement worth approximately 18% of EEA GDP. Therefore, there are significant opportunities for companies within the EEA because they can compete for government contracts throughout the Internal Market.\n\nFind general information about public procurement legislation, rules and access to different markets. Find Specific information on the EU market of public procurement.\n\nInvestment\n\nFind general information to enable your investment abroad i. If you are investing from abroad into the EEA, find specific information.\n\nOther (competition, TSD)\n\nCompetition\n\nIn order to ensure a homogeneous EEA with equal conditions for competition, the same competition rules apply to all undertakings throughout the EEA. The rules on competition in the Internal Market cover four main areas and are identical in the three EEA EFTA States and the EU Member States. These rules are:\n\nElimination of agreements that restrict competition and the abuse of a dominant position (e.g. price-fixing agreements between competitors)\n\nControl of mergers between firms (e.g. a merger between two large groups which results in their dominating the market)\n\nLiberalisation of monopolistic economic sectors (e.g. telecommunications)\n\nProhibition − subject to certain exceptions − of state aid that would distort competition by selectively favouring certain firms or national industrial sectors.\n\nAs a result of the strict competition rules incorporated into the EEA Agreement, anti-dumping measures, countervailing duties and other trade measures are, as a general rule, forbidden between the EEA States.\n\nState Aid\n\nIn line with the EU Treaties, the EEA Agreement generally prohibits any measures that can be identified as state aid, including grants, soft loans and tax concessions, which may distort trade. However, certain political, economic and social considerations may lead to exceptions to this prohibition.\n\nUseful links and documents"
