        "text": "Liechtenstein (officially the Principality of Liechtenstein) is a country in Western Europe. It is the sixth smallest country in the world[8] and, with Uzbekistan, one of only two doubly landlocked countries. This means that it is bordered by landlocked countries. Liechtenstein is located between Austria and Switzerland.\n\nThe official language in Liechtenstein is German. The capital of Liechtenstein is Vaduz, a very small town of 5,000 people. Liechtenstein is famous for its many private banks.\n\nLiechtenstein is known as a principality. This means that the monarch has the title of Prince.\n\nThe territory that is now Liechtenstein was once split into two different states, the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg, which were both part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Liechtenstein family wanted more power within the Holy Roman Empire. In the 17th century, the Holy Roman Emperor made Karl Liechtenstein a Prince. Karl's descendant, Hans Adam I purchased the lands of the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg and united them into one principality named Liechtenstein.\n\nIn 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was broken up by Napoleon. With the fall of the Empire, Liechtenstein became a free independent country. Liechtenstein remained neutral during World War I and World War II. Hitler did have plans to invade Liechtenstein alongside Switzerland in the planned Operation Tannenbaum but never did.\n\nLiechtenstein is located in the European Alps and is bordered to the east by the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, to the south by the canton of Grisons (Switzerland) and to the west by the canton of St. Gallen (Switzerland).\n\nThe Rhine forms the entire western border of Liechtenstein. Measured south to north the country is about 24 km (15 mi) long. Its highest point, the Grauspitz, is 2,599 m (8,527 ft).\n\nDespite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports.\n\nLiechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy, meaning that the head of state is a monarch (with the title Prince Regnant) but has limited political powers. The Prince can veto legislations, call for a referendum, create new bills and dissolve parliament.\n\nThe legislature is the landtag (or diet). There are 25 elected members. The members of government are usually all members of the biggest political party."
