        "text": "Is Liechtenstein in the Schengen Area?\n\nThe tiny mountain principality of Liechtenstein is part of the Schengen Area, meaning that to travel there for a short trip lasting fewer than 90 days you will need a Liechtenstein Schengen Visa. While there, you can view its medieval castles and stunning alpine landscapes. It became a member in 2011 - making it the most recent country to join the Schengen region.\n\nIs Liechtenstein an EU member state?\n\nLiechtenstein is not a member of the European Union, but is in both the Schengen Area and the European Economic Area. It also has a customs union and a monetary union with Switzerland - which is also not an EU member but is in the Schengen zone.\n\nWho needs a Schengen Visa to enter Liechtenstein?\n\nIf you are traveling to Liechtenstein you will need a Schengen Visa if you are a citizen of a non-Schengen country without a visa-free travel agreement with the area, or if you have been refused for visa-free travel. A Schengen Visa to travel to Liechtenstein costs €80 for adults and €40 for children.\n\nMore information on the Schengen Area of countries and visas.\n\nHow do I apply for a Schengen Visa to Liechtenstein?\n\nIn addition to this, you will need two recently taken passport-style photos, your passport or other travel documents that are no older than 10 years and valid for at least three months after your departure date from the Schengen Area. You will also need travel and medical insurance covering you up to costs of €30,000, a cover letter stating your itinerary and the purpose of your visit, as well as a flight itinerary and proof of accommodation, proof of your civil status, like a marriage certificate, and proof you have means of subsistence during your stay. The amount you need to show you have will vary from country to country. Those planning to work or study, you will need additional documents. Proof of sufficient financial means, is not specifically stipulated by the Liechtenstein government, and is regulated on a case-by-case basis. You can do this by showing bank statements, hotel bookings, and that your income or investments are enough to support yourself during your trip.\n\nHow do I get a Liechtenstein work visa?\n\nYou need a short-term residence permit (L) to work in Liechtenstein and an employment offer from a company in Liechtenstein for up to one year. You will need to provide the embassy/consulate with documents that prove you meet Liechtenstein Schengen Visa requirements based on your employment status. If employed, you need an employment contract, a current bank statement, a no objection letter from your employer giving you leave to travel, and an income tax return.\n\nIf self-employed, you will need a copy of your business license, company bank statements, and income tax returns. You will also need an invitation letter regardless of whether you are applying for a work visa or a short-stay Schengen Visa.\n\nHow can I study in Liechtenstein?\n\nStudent visas require proof of enrolment at a Liechtenstein institution, a no objection letter from your place of study in your homeland, and an invitation letter.\n\nWhat are the steps to follow when applying for a Liechtenstein Schengen Visa?\n\nWhat are the steps to follow when applying for a Liechtenstein Schengen Visa?\n\nWork out which Liechtenstein Schengen visa type you need based on the purpose of your travel. Collect the required documents for a visa to Liechtenstein. Make a visa appointment with the embassy/consulate or a Liechtenstein accredited visa application center in your home country. Attend the visa interview at the appropriate Liechtenstein embassy/consulate/visa application center. Wait to see if your visa is approved - you can also track your application.\n\nWhere do I apply for a Liechtenstein Visa?\n\nYou will need to apply to the Liechtenstein embassy or consulate in your country of residence, or a visa application center acting on its behalf.

AXA’s Low Cost Travel Insurance costs just €22 ($25) per week of your trip and will meet your visa requirements, while the AXA Schengen Europe Travel Insurance offers extended coverage up to costs of €100,000.\n\nThose seeking a multiple-entry visa can purchase the annual Multi Trip insurance from €328 per year, which again covers you for expenses up to €100,000.\n\nOther Schengen countries you might be interested in\n\nAustria visa\n\nBelgium visa\n\nCzech Republic visa\n\nDenmark visa\n\nEstonia visa\n\nFinland visa\n\nFrance visa\n\nGermany visa\n\nGreece visa\n\nHungary visa\n\nIceland visa\n\nItaly Visa\n\nLatvia visa\n\nLiechtenstein visa\n\nLithuania visa\n\nLuxembourg visa\n\nMalta visa\n\nNetherlands visa\n\nNorway visa\n\nPoland visa\n\nPortugal visa\n\nSlovakia visa\n\nSlovenia visa\n\nSpain Visa\n\nSweden visa\n\nSwitzerland visa\n\nCroatia visa\n\nRelated topics on the Schengen area\n\nWhich countries are not part of the Schengen area ?\n\nWhat is the Schengen Agreement ?\n\nAll you need to know about border control in the Schengen Area\n\nWhat does Schengen mean ?\n\nWhat is the Schengen acquis ?\n\nFrequently asked questions about getting a Liechtenstein Schengen Visa"
