        "text": "When you visit our website, our servers temporarily save every access in a protocol file. The following data is automatically collected:\n\nThe IP address of the computer accessing the website\n\nDate and time of access\n\nName and URL of the accessed file\n\nWebsite, from which access is made\n\nOperating System of your computer and your browser\n\nCountry from which you access our website and the language settings of your browser\n\nName of your internet access provider\n\nWe collect and process this data to enable you to access our website (to establish a connection), to ensure safety and stability of our systems, to optimize our website for you and for statistical purposes. In particular, we use your IP address to localize your country of domicile and to optimize settings of the website (e.g. to adapt the language). The IP address is also used to be able to react to attacks against our network infrastructure. All these data processing activities are based on these legitimate interests (art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).\n\nWe would also like to point out that we use so-called cookies, tracking tools and social media plug-ins (see below sections IV to VII). We may also transfer data to third parties and/or abroad (see below sections VIII and IX).\n\nYou have the possibility on our website to subscribe to our Newsletter. For this, a registration is required. In this context, the following data must be provided:\n\nSir/Madam (mandatory)\n\nName/First Name (mandatory)\n\nEmail address (mandatory)\n\nThis information is necessary to process your data. In addition, you can provide further data on an optional basis (date of birth and country). We exclusively process this data to personalize the information and offers we send to you and to adapt them better to your needs.\n\nIn order to send our Newsletters, we use the E-Marketing Suite of the Wilken Software Group. Please read carefully also the privacy policy of the Wilken Software Group, which you can find at https://www.wilken.de/datenschutz/. Our Newsletter may contain a so-called Web Beacon or similar technical tools. These are small, invisible graphics of the size of 1x1 pixel, which are linked to the user ID of the addressee of the Newsletter.\n\nOur use of such services and technologies allows us to analyze whether you opened the Newsletter and how you read it. This helps us to assess whether or how the contents of our Newsletters could be improved or further customized and to compile statistics about our Newsletters. If you delete the Newsletter, also these small graphics will be deleted. If you would like to prevent Tracking Pixels from being active, please adjust your email program so that Newsletters are not shown in HTML format.\n\nIf you subscribe for Newsletters, you express your consent to receiving the respective information and that we may use these technologies and process data for statistical assessment of your use and our optimization of the Newsletter. Our legal permission to do this accordingly consists of your consent (art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). Furthermore, the described analytical purposes constitute our legitimate interests in these data processing activities (art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).\n\nAt the end of each Newsletter, you will find a link, through which you can de-register from Newsletters at all times. You can de-register for the entire Newsletter or for certain channels. If you de-register from the entire Newsletter, we will delete all your respective data from our system.\n\nIn the following section, we would like to explain to you which of your data is collected and processed for promotional purposes and how this is done. All these data processing activities are based on our legitimate interest, pursuant to art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our interest lies in particular in direct marketing purposes and in the analysis and assessment of the use of our website. By using our website you are moreover consenting to these data processing activities, pursuant to art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.\n\nCreation of pseudonymised user profiles\n\nIn order to present personalized services and information on our website (on-site-targeting), we use and analyse the data which we collect about you when you visit our website. In this context, so-called cookies can be used (see section IV).The analysis of your behaviour as a user can lead to the creation of a so-called user profile. However, your user data is only used together with pseudonyms, but never with non-pseudonymized, p ersonal data.\n\nIn order to enable personalized marketing in social networks, we implement so-called remarketing pixel of Facebook and Twitter on our website. If you have an account with one of these social networks and if you are logged in while visiting our website, this pixel links your use of our website with your account. If you would like to prevent this link, you need to log out from your social media account before visiting our website. You can change further settings concerning advertisement in your user profile of the respective social network.\n\nRetargeting\n\nWe use so-called retargeting technologies on our website. These technologies analyze your behavior on our website, so that it will be possible to offer you customized advertisements also on partner websites. Your behavior as a user is saved on an anonymous basis. Most retargeting technologies work with so-called cookies (see section IV).\n\nOur website uses Google AdWords Remarketing and DoubleClick by Google, services of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,USA (\"Google\"), to display advertisements based on the websites you have previously visited. To this end Google uses what is known as a DoubleClick cookie. This makes it possible for your browser to be recognised when you visit other websites. The information generated by the cookie about your visit to these websites (including your IP address) are sent to a Google server in the United States and stored there (for more information about transfer of personal data to the United States, please see section 10).\n\nGoogle will use this information to analyse your use of the website regarding advertisements to be displayed, to compile reports for website operators on activity and advertisements on the website, and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required to do so by law or if third parties process the information on Google's behalf.\n\nWe also use Google Tag Manager to manage browsing-based advertising services. The Tag Manager tool itself is a cookie-less domain and does not collect any personal data. However, the tool triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. If you have deactivated tags at domain level or cookie level, this deactivation will remain in place for all tracking tags implemented by Google Tag Manager.\n\nYou can always prevent retargeting technologies if you de-activate the respective Cookies in your browser settings (see section VI). You can also apply for an opt-out for these advertising and retargeting tools via the website of the Digital Advertising Alliance (optout.aboutads.info).\n\nTwitter Analytics\n\nFor statistical purposes our website uses the visitor action pixel of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA(\"Twitter\"). The pixel enables us to track the behaviour of users when they have clicked on a Twitter advertisement and been redirected to our website. This procedure is used to evaluate the effectiveness of Twitter advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and can thus help us optimise future advertising measures.\n\nThe data collected in this process does not make it possible to draw any conclusions about the identity of the user. However, the data is stored and processed by Twitter so that a connection can be made to the profile of the respective user and Twitter can use the data for its own advertising purposes. This data can enable Twitter and its partners to place advertisements on Twitter and elsewhere. Furthermore, a cookie may be stored and read on users' computers for these purposes.\n\nOur website uses various additional tracking tools. These tracking tools are used to monitor your behaviour while you surf our website. The purpose is to design the website based on the demands of our users and to make ongoing improvements to the website. Pseudonymised user profiles are created and cookies are also used. For more information on the tracking tools used and the resulting data processing, please click on the following link: www.ghostery.com/de/.\n\nMatomo (formerly called Piwik)\n\nThis website uses the open source web analysis service Matomo. Matomo uses technologies that make it possible to recognize the user across multiple pages with the aim of analyzing the user patterns (e.g. cookies or device fingerprinting). The information recorded by Matomo about the use of this website will be stored on our server. Prior to archiving, the IP address will first be anonymized. Through Matomo, we are able to collect and analyze data on the use of our website by website visitors. This enables us to find out, for instance, when which page views occurred and from which region they came. In addition, we collect various log files (e.g. IP address, referrer, browser, and operating system used) and can measure whether our website visitors perform certain actions (e.g. clicks, purchases, etc.). The use of this analysis tool is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to optimize the operator’s web offerings and advertising. If a corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time. We host Matomo exclusively on our own servers so that all analysis data remains with us and is not passed on.\n\nOn our website, we use so-called social media plugins and we would like to explain to you how they work. As a default, these plugins are de-activated and they therefore do not send any data. If, however, you click on a social media button, you activate the respective plugin. If the plugins are activated, your browser will establish a direct connection with the servers of the respective social network. The content of the plugin will be sent from the social network to your browser and implemented into the website. You can deactivate the plugins again by one click. However, we ask you to have a careful look also at the respective data protection information and privacy policies of the social networks further described below, as they also contain important information.\n\nFacebook\n\nOn our website, we use social media plugins of Facebook to make our website more personal. This plugin is offered and operated by the US company Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.\n\nWe use the \"LIKE\" or \"SHARE\" button. By implementing these plugins, Facebook receives the information that your browser is currently using our respective website, even if you do not have a Facebook account or if you are currently not logged in to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) will be sent from your browser directly to a server of Facebook in the United States and it will be saved there.\n\nIf you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can attribute your use of our website directly to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, e.g. by using the \"LIKE\" or \"SHARE\" button, this information will equally be directly sent to a server of Facebook and saved there. The information will furthermore be published on Facebook and shown to your Facebook friends.\n\nFacebook can use this information for marketing, advertising, advertising research, targeted advertising or for the targeted design of Facebook pages. For this purposed, Facebook establishes user and interest profiles, e.g. to assess your use of our website and to define advertising shown to you on Facebook and/or to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website and/or for other services linked to your use of Facebook.\n\nIf you prefer that Facebook cannot attribute the information about your use of our website to your Facebook account, you need to log out of Facebook prior to using our website. We furthermore ask you to have a careful look at the data protection information of Facebook, in particular concerning the purposes and extent of data processing by Facebook and concerning Facebook's further processing of your data, your respective rights and possible privacy settings.\n\nTwitter\n\nWe use plugins of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (commonly known as the messaging system \"Twitter\"). The Twitter plugins (tweet buttons) can be recognised by the Twitter logo on our website. You can find an overview about the tween button here: http://dev.twitter.com. If you activate this plugin, a direct connection will be established between your browser and the twitter Server. This means that twitter will receive the information that you have visited our website with your IP address. If you click on the tweet button, while you are logged in to your twitter account, you can link the content of our site to your twitter profile. This means that twitter can attribute your visit to our website to your user account. We would like to inform you that we have no further knowledge of the content of the data transferred to twitter and how twitter precisely uses such data, so we recommend that you have a careful look also at the twitter privacy policy and data protection information, which can be found here: http://twitter.com/privacy .\n\nIf you prefer that twitter cannot attribute your use of our website to your twitter account, please log out of your twitter account before using our website.\n\nLiechtenstein Marketing has the right to transfer your data to third parties (so-called third party processors) domiciled abroad, if this is required for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. These third parties will be obliged to protect your data in the same way as we are. If these third parties are domiciled in a country with a lower level of data protection than Switzerland or the European Union, we use contractual agreements or other legal arrangements to make sure that your data is adequately protected in the same way as in Switzerland or, respectively, in the European Union at all times.\n\nData transfers to the United States\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we would also like to inform you specifically that in the United States, surveillance mechanisms may exist which can broadly save and/or monitor all the data transferred to the United States. This may happen without a detailed differentiation, limitation or exception and/or not based on objective criteria, which would restrict access of US authorities to your data to specific and clearly defined purposes, which could justify access to such data or the impact caused by its use. We would also like to inform you that in the United States, you may not have similar legal remedies to protect your data as they may exist in Switzerland and/or the European Union to gain access to your data, request a deletion or correction thereof or legal remedies against access to your data by authorities.\n\nIt is important to us to underline these factual and legal circumstances so that you are adequately informed and so that you can take an informed decision about the use of your data and whether you consent to the data processing activities described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nWe would also like to inform users domiciled in a Member State of the European Union that the United States does not have – among others for the reasons mentioned in this section – a data protection level which would be considered adequate from the perspective of the European Union.\n\nInsofar as we have explained in this document that recipients of personal data (as for example Google, Facebook or Twitter) have their legal seat in the US, we will make sure that your personal data is adequately protected by contractual agreements or by making sure that these companies are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield."
