        "text": "Overview\n\nVienna is one of the four headquarters of the United Nations (UN), along with Geneva, Nairobi and New York. The \"UNO City\" is home to various departments of the UN Secretariat and around 5â€™000 employees. The organisations based in the Vienna International Center (VIC) include the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the United Nations Office at Vienna (UNOV) and the Department of International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\nLiechtenstein at the UN in Vienna\n\nLiechtenstein has been accredited to the UN headquarters in Vienna since 2000. The UN in Vienna deals with a broad range of topics, from which the work on combating drugs and crime and the activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are of particular interest to Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein is primarily involved at the UN in Vienna at the expert level on Liechtenstein priority topics that fall within these areas (e.g. combating corruption or cybercrime).\n\nLiechtenstein's activities at the UN in Vienna are used to publicise and anchor Liechtenstein initiatives. In addition to participating in negotiations on particularly relevant resolutions or new international agreements, participation in UN work in Vienna offers the opportunity to raise awareness of and promote Liechtenstein initiatives, for example in the area of combating human trafficking. From time to time, Liechtenstein also takes on tasks within the framework of the work of the regional groups, such as the co-chairmanship of the Western European Group in the IAEA 2021/2022."
