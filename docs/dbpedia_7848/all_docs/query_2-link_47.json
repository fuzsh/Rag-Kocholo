        "text": "In general, the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines apply in Liechtenstein. However, certain taxpayers (e.g. small companies) are not obliged to provide documentation which complies with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for certain transactions.\n\nOther than the very general rules in the tax code and the tax ordinance, there are no official guidelines regarding transfer pricing (e.g. issued by the Liechtenstein tax authority).\n\nThe tax ordinance refers to the current OECD methods, i.e. the comparable uncontrolled price, resale price, cost plus, transactional net margin, and profit split methods. Other methods may be used if the aforementioned methods are not suitable for the specific transaction.\n\nThe ordinance does not include a hierarchy of methods and refers to the OECD Guidelines. Rather, the actual facts and circumstances of the relevant transaction have to be taken into account when choosing which method to apply.\n\nTaxpayers have the obligation to make sure that all of their transactions with related parties adhere to the arm’s length principle for tax purposes and that the relevant documentation is prepared.\n\nIn Liechtenstein, all tax returns from individuals and legal persons are assessed by the tax authority annually. This, however, does not mean that the tax treatment of a certain transaction is approved by the tax authority if the assessment of one year does not include amendments for this transaction. The tax authority may also review this transaction in a following year and conclude that the selected method or documentation are not appropriate.\n\nThe level of required documentation depends on the size of the company and the related parties as well as on the size of the respective transaction.\n\nDocumentation requirements for big and medium-sized companies (see below for definitions) and participations in the related parties of at least 25%:\n\nMembers of a group of companies with a consolidated annual revenue exceeding CHF 900 m have to prepare a master file and local file. Documentation for the following cross-border transactions has to be prepared:\n\nPurchase and/or sale of goods to related parties of more than CHF 1 m p.a. per related party\n\nAll other types of expenses and income if > CHF 250’000 p.a. per related party\n\nCompanies of which the total assets exceed CHF 25.9 m p.a., the net sales are more than CHF 51.8 m p.a. and who employ on average more than 250 persons have to prepare the following documentation for certain cross-border transactions (sale/purchase of goods > CHF 500’000 p.a. per related party; all other types of expenses and income if > CHF 125’000 p.a. per related party):\n\nDescription of the company, the business model and the legal and organizational structure\n\nList of all business relationships with related parties (type and scope);\n\nDescription of the allocation of relevant functions, risks and assets between the different parties involved in related party transactions\n\nDescription of the selection of the transfer pricing method(s) for the relevant transaction(s) or type(s) of transaction(s) and reasons why the transfer pricing method(s) applied were selected\n\nDocumentation and/or analysis of the specific transfer pricing determination and the suitability of the transfer pricing method(s) used\n\nFor the aforementioned transactions, documentation has to be provided to the tax authority within 60 days upon request. The documentation may be in German or English.\n\nDocumentation requirements for small companies as well as big and medium-sized companies of which the participation in the related party does not exceed 25%:\n\nFor all other transactions between related parties (i.e. for participations lower than 25% or if the aforementioned criteria regarding the size of the company are not met), the taxpayer has to provide the tax authority upon request with “appropriate” documentation. Neither the tax code nor the tax ordinance contain any further regulations which methods or types of documentation are regarded as appropriate.\n\nCountry-by-country reporting:\n\nLiechtenstein introduced country-by-country reporting in 2016 (entering into force on 2017/01/01) for groups with consolidated revenues over CHF 900m. The legal basis are the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) and the national CbC code."
