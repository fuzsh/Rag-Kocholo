        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe countries listed in Schedule A were entitled to become original members under Article II, Section 1, and therefore the Fund would not have been able to reject the acceptance of membership by these countries on the ground that they did not meet the Fund’s criteria for membership. An applicant for membership does not have a similar right to membership under Article II, Section 2, and therefore the Fund applies criteria by which to determine whether it will comply with an application. The Fund has developed the following criteria for this purpose:\n\n(1) The applicant is a “country.” This criterion follows from the text of Article II, Section 2.\n\n(2) The country is in formal control of its external relations. This criterion is derived in part from Article XX, Section 2 (g), which lists the territories in respect of which a member undertakes the obligations of the Articles: “By their signature of this Agreement, all governments accept it both on their own behalf and in respect of all their colonies, overseas territories, all territories under their protection, suzerainty, or authority and all territories in respect of which they exercise a mandate.” These territories, it will be seen in Chapter 10, are not eligible for membership in their own right. The element that unifies the diverse territories listed in the provision is that they do not control all of their external relations. A country usually assumes the control of its foreign relations when it ceases to be a dependency of another country, and for this reason the criterion of control has sometimes been equated with independence and sometimes, but less often, with sovereignty, but these are troublesome concepts. They become even more troublesome if they are taken to mean actual as distinguished from formal independence or sovereignty. If reliance on the economic or military aid of another country were a criterion, membership would have been denied to many countries. For these reasons, in the practice of the Fund the concepts of independence and sovereignty have been avoided on the whole as a mode of expressing a criterion for membership in the Fund.\n\nThe criterion of the control of external relations does not mean that some of those relations cannot be the subject of regulation by treaty. For example, Cyprus became independent in August 1960 pursuant to treaty arrangements to which Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom were parties. Under the Treaty of Guarantee between Cyprus of the one part and the other three countries of the other part, Cyprus undertakes not to participate, in whole or in part, in any political or economic union with any state whatsoever. In the event of any breach of the treaty, the three guaranteeing countries will consult on the representations or measures necessary to ensure observance of the treaty, and insofar as common or concerted action is not possible, each of them reserves the right to take action designed solely to re-establish the state of affairs created by the treaty. No question of the eligibility of Cyprus for membership was raised when its application was considered by the Fund.\n\nAlthough international personality is a requisite of membership, it does not follow that every territory that is considered an international person is eligible for membership. If a tautology may be permitted, an international person can be defined as a subject of international law, or an entity to which international law applies, or an entity that is widely recognized by states as having international personality.1 Protectorates are international persons to some extent, and territories subject to suzerainty may have this status,2 but because of Article XX, Section 2 (g), neither can become members of the Fund.\n\n(3) The country is willing and able to perform the obligations of membership contained in the Articles. This criterion follows in part from Article XX, Section 2 (a), but it is necessary to add the gloss that the criterion may be deemed to be satisfied even though ability to perform the obligations of membership is dependent on the cooperation of other members. The ability to perform the obligations of the Articles is not the same criterion as the control of external relations, but because the absence of this form of control may negate the ability to perform the obligations, the two criteria have sometimes been combined or confused.\n\nThe issue by an applicant of a currency of its own, or a currency that it alone uses, is not a criterion. This is discussed further in Chapter 4.\n\nMeaning of “Country”\n\nMembership in some international organizations is available to “states,”3 and in others to “nations”4 or “countries.”5 Under Article II, Section 1, of the Fund’s Articles, the “original members” are the “countries” “represented” at the Bretton Woods Conference “whose governments” accept membership before a specified date. Under Article II, Section 2, membership shall be open to the “governments of other countries.” Section 1 refers to the countries and not the governments represented at the Bretton Woods Conference because the French delegation and the Danish Minister at Washington, who attended the Conference, could not be regarded as the representatives of a French or Danish government. The inclusion of France and Denmark in Schedule A shows that they were regarded as countries represented at the Conference.\n\nThe word “state” is imprecise and has been the subject of much learned discussion.6 It is often defined as an entity with a permanent population, demarcated territory, effective government, and independence in its internal and external affairs (i.e., is not under the control of another state in the conduct of these affairs). Some authorities who accept these elements do not insist on their absolute character. For example, Lauterpacht refers to “a reasonably well-defined territory, a population, and the existence of an independent Government enjoying a reasonable degree of stability.” 7 The word “country” may have been adopted because of the absence of agreement on the definition of a “state,” although the word “country” is resonant with ambiguities of its own,8 so that “its meaning varies by untold degrees with the context in which it is employed.” 9\n\nAnother possibility is that “country” was preferred because of the characteristics of certain participants in the Bretton Woods Conference, i.e., four British Dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa), India, and the Philippines. It is least likely that there was any serious question about the international status of the Dominions. A landmark in their movement toward full international personality was a statement of the Imperial Conference of 1926 that defined “the group of self-governing communities composed of Great Britain and the Dominions” as follows: “They are autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.” 10 At the Imperial Conference of 1937 it was recorded that each member of the Commonwealth takes part in multilateral treaties as a separate entity, and that unless a treaty provides to the contrary, no member of the Commonwealth is in any way responsible for the obligations undertaken by any other member.11 The Statute of Westminster, 1931,12 passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, provides that thereafter no law or provision made by a Dominion Parliament shall be void or inoperative on the ground of repugnancy to the law of England or an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, that a Dominion Parliament shall have power to repeal legislation of the Parliament of the United Kingdom insofar as it is in force in the Dominion, and that in future no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to a Dominion or a part thereof unless the Dominion has requested and consented to its enactment.\n\nIt has been concluded that the effect of these and other developments on the Dominions was “to make their status indistinguishable from that of full international personality.” 13 There were certain intra-Commonwealth procedures and practices that did not apply to international entities outside the Commonwealth. Some of these related to diplomatic practice and to consultation on vital political matters affecting peace and war. Another special feature of the Commonwealth was the doubt about the right of any part of it to remain neutral while the others were at war. Moreover, members of the Commonwealth did not regard the relations among themselves as fully “international” in such matters as the exchange of representatives and the registration of agreements. These features of the Dominions led one authority to point out in 1938 that they were different in some respects from other states, but that they were “unquestionably States of international law.” 14\n\nThe standing of the Dominions as “states” was questioned during the discussions among the technical experts of the United States who were working on a draft charter for the United Nations. They recognized the desirability of membership for the Dominions, but feared that this might lead to a claim by the U. S. S. R. that its constituent republics were eligible for membership. The U. S. experts were satisfied that there was a distinction because the Dominions, unlike the republics, maintained diplomatic relations of their own with other states. Nevertheless, the draft they prepared referred to “all self-governing States and Dominions,” following language that had been employed in the Covenant of the League of Nations.15\n\nWith respect to India, one authority wrote:\n\nThe position of India as a subject of International Law was for a time anomalous. She became a member of the League of Nations; she was invited to the San Francisco Conference of the United Nations in April 1945; she exercised the treaty-making power in her own right. However, so long as the control of her internal and external relations rested ultimately with the British Government and Parliament, she could not be regarded as a sovereign State and as a normal subject of International Law. In 1947 she became a fully self-governing Dominion and an independent State.16\n\nAt the San Francisco Conference a delegate of the U. S. S. R. asserted, in April 1945, that India and the Philippines lacked independence.17\n\nThe Philippine Independence Act (the Tydings-McDuffie Act) was approved by the U. S. Congress on March 24, 1934 and provided that the Philippine legislature was authorized to frame a constitution for the Philippine Islands. The constitution was to be submitted to the President of the United States, who would determine whether it conformed with the Act, and if he certified that it did, it was to be submitted to the people of the Philippines for their approval or rejection. The Act provided that on the fourth day of July immediately following the expiration of a period of ten years after the inauguration of the new government under the constitution, the President of the United States “shall by proclamation withdraw and surrender all right of possession, supervision, jurisdiction, control, or sovereignty then existing and exercised by the United States in and over the territory and people of the Philippine Islands … and, on behalf of the United States, shall recognize the independence of the Philippine Islands as a separate and self-governing nation. …” During the transition to independence, the foreign affairs of the Philippines were to remain under the control of the United States. President Truman issued the proclamation referred to by the Act on July 4, 1946.18 The Philippines had been included in Schedule A of the Articles two years earlier.\n\nThe complications that might have been created by the word “state” in relation to some of the participants in the Bretton Woods Conference were avoided by making all of them eligible for original membership because of their participation in the Conference. This technique was adopted later in the drafting of the Charter of the United Nations. The difficulties inherent in the words “state,” “nation,” and “government” arose,19 but were resolved for original members by distinguishing them from other members.20 Article 3 of the Charter provides that the original members shall be the states that participated in the San Francisco Conference or had signed the Declaration of the United Nations of January 1, 1942 and that sign and ratify the Charter. Under Article 4, membership is open to all peace-loving states that accept the Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out the obligations of the Charter. Membership is effected by decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.\n\nThe word “countries” in Article II of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement is not qualified by any adjective comparable to the adjective “peace-loving” that qualifies “states” in Article 3 of the Charter of the United Nations. The absence of any adjective in the Articles emphasizes the breadth of the discretion that the Fund may exercise in admitting countries to membership. “Peace-loving” was inserted in the Charter to give expression to the “general agreement that the enemy countries would have to work ‘their passage home’ before they could be admitted” to the United Nations.21 The drafters of the Articles undoubtedly shared this opinion in relation to the Fund even though they did not express it in the text.\n\nThe desire to give the Fund flexibility in dealing with applications may explain not only the absence of any adjective that qualifies “countries” but also the choice of that word itself.22 For example, a clearly demarcated territory is said to be one characteristic of a state,23 but the Fund decided to admit former enemies of the United Nations before peace treaties had been entered into and therefore before their precise borders had been defined. The uncertainty of boundaries was not considered to be a problem even though a number of the obligations of a member under the Articles are territorial in scope. The United Nations also has admitted countries even though their frontiers had not yet been delineated.24\n\nClearly, the word “country” has not precluded membership even when the applicant government controlled only part of the territory of what had been regarded as a single entity in international law, and even though there was no prospect within view of unified control under a single authority. Germany, Korea, and Viet-Nam illustrate this phenomenon. Viet-Nam, for example, was established as a single state under the Geneva Agreements of July 1954. The declaration of July 21, 1954 25 adopted by the Geneva Conference referred to Viet-Nam as one political entity, i.e., as encompassing both North and South Viet-Nam, and made it clear that the “military demarcation line” near the seventeenth parallel was “provisional” and “should not in any way be interpreted as constituting a political or territorial boundary.” The settlement of political problems was to be “effected on the basis of respect for the principles of independence, unity and territorial integrity,” and free general elections were to be held under international supervision in July 1956.\n\nViet-Nam applied for membership on December 21, 1955, and the application was considered by the Fund in the period March to May 1956. The application had been submitted by “the Government of Viet-Nam,” which was in control only of South Viet-Nam. The division of territory was referred to by the staff in the papers prepared for the committee on membership and in the committee’s consideration of the application. The entity admitted to membership was “the Republic of Viet-Nam.” 26 There was no discussion of the inability of the applicant to ensure the observance of the obligations of the Articles in the north. Only one director abstained on the decision of the Executive Directors recommending the draft resolution to the Board of Governors, on the ground that full sovereignty in Viet-Nam had been suspended for the time being and that the two governments had the status of provisional governments. The government that had appointed him had not granted de jure recognition to either.\n\nOn May 7, 1964, the United States informed the Fund that it had applied restrictions on payments and transfers to North Viet-Nam as from midday on May 5, 1964. The Fund took no action of any kind, including action under the decision of August 14, 1952, which establishes a special procedure for the approval of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions that are imposed solely for the preservation of national or international security.27 The Fund’s inaction was based on the theory that North Viet-Nam was nonmember territory and that members are free to apply restrictions on transactions with a nonmember or with persons in its territory in accordance with Article XI, Section 2. The restrictions imposed by the United States against North Korea as from midday on December 17, 1950 were treated in the same way. The Republic of Korea entered the Fund on August 26, 1955, but the Fund took no action with respect to the restrictions, which were still in effect when Korea became a member.\n\nWhen an applicant government is in control of only part of the territory of what has been regarded as a single entity, the demarcation of territory can produce problems that are not confined to the legal problem of eligibility for membership. For example, the task of determining an appropriate quota may be complicated because the statistics on the basis of which normally a quota is calculated may relate to the undivided territory. Difficulties of this kind have not been insurmountable even though the statistics cannot be apportioned easily between the divided territories. In these circumstances, less attention has been paid to the statistics and broader tests have been applied, such as the quotas of members comparable in contemporary economic importance to the territory controlled by the applicant government.\n\nOne of the characteristics of a state is often said to be the existence of a stable and effective government, although it would probably be more exact to say that the existence of such a government is one test by which to judge whether a new state has emerged. There is evidence in the Fund’s delay in proceeding with the applications of Korea and the Republic of Congo (now Zaïre) that there was an implicit acceptance of this test in connection with the admission of an applicant. The membership of a country is not interrupted, however, if it ceases for a time to have a stable and effective government. The absence of such a government might result in a member’s failure to fulfill its obligations and enable the Fund to require the member to withdraw.28 In practice, however, the Fund would not be likely to compel withdrawal except perhaps in extreme circumstances.\n\n“Governments” in Relation to Membership\n\nUnder Article II, Section 1, the original members are the “countries” represented at the Bretton Woods Conference “whose governments accept membership.” Under Article II, Section 2, “membership” is open to the “governments of other countries,” and similar language is used in other provisions.29 In Article III, Section 3 (d), the country is referred to as the member. In some provisions, only the government is referred to as the member.30 No great importance need be attached to this choice of terminology. “Unless … an agreement,” said Hyde, “is in fact concluded between government and government, rather than between State and State, the reference to the agents rather than the principals as the contracting parties merits slight commendation.” 31 It has always been understood that the members of the Fund are the states (or the countries if there is a difference between the two words) that become members through the action of their governments. The preamble of the resolution for Jordan modified the language used in earlier resolutions in order to avoid any ambiguity about this aspect of membership.32 Formerly, the preamble had referred to the terms and conditions that the Board of Governors might wish to prescribe “for admitting that Government to membership in the Fund.” In the resolution for Jordan “that country” was substituted for “that Government,” and the amended language has been employed in later resolutions.\n\nAlthough under the Articles a member’s rights are enjoyed by and its obligations are borne by the country, it is not compelled to conduct its relations with the Fund through its government departments. A member frequently entrusts its central bank, whatever may be the bank’s legal status in relation to the government, with the direct exercise of the member’s financial rights and the performance of its financial obligations. This arrangement is in accordance with the provision of the Articles that requires each member to deal with the Fund only through its treasury, central bank, stabilization fund, or other similar fiscal agency, and requires the Fund to deal only with or through the same agencies.33 In addition, a member must designate its central bank as the depository for the Fund’s holdings of the member’s currency, or, if the member has no central bank, another institution acceptable to the Fund.34 Finally, the Fund must accept from a member notes or similar obligations in place of any part of the Fund’s holdings of the member’s currency that the Fund considers that it does not need for the time being for its operations, and these securities may be issued by the member or by the member’s depository in its own name.35 None of these provisions derogates from the principle that the rights and obligations of membership under the Articles are those of the country, whatever its domestic arrangements may be for conducting its relations with the Fund. Therefore, although the notes or similar obligations substituted for a member’s currency may be issued by and in the name of the depository designated by the member, the Fund’s assets are guaranteed by the member against any loss resulting from failure or default on the part of the depository.36\n\nBecause the “government” is not really the “member,” the obligations of a member assumed by accepting the Articles or in dealing with the Fund are not affected by a change of government whether it takes place by constitutional or unconstitutional means. The Fund sometimes asks a new government whether it will continue to follow the policies of its predecessor, but these approaches do not affect the principle of the continuity of obligations. Moreover, the absence of a government need not prevent the Fund from continuing to deal with a member, because it can go on dealing with the fiscal agency that the member has designated.\n\nThe principle that the obligations imposed by the Articles or arising under them are the obligations of a member provides no mechanical answer to the question of the entities that must be taken to constitute the member for the purposes of the Articles. For example, a member must not buy gold at a premium,37 and if some national entity does enter into these transactions, when will they be deemed to be purchases by the member in violation of its obligations? It has been decided that a “member” consists of all departments of the member’s government, whether or not they have monetary functions, and all the member’s fiscal agencies, whether or not they are government departments. The term “similar fiscal agency” appears in Article XIX (b), and the Fund has decided that the term means “an institution which performs an important function or functions similar to those normally performed by a Treasury, or central bank, or stabilization fund.” 38 It will be obvious that this definition cannot provide automatic answers to all the questions that may be posed by the practice of members.\n\nRecognition of States\n\nThe Fund’s practice under Article II, Section 2, has been based on the principle that it is entitled to make its own findings on the eligibility of “countries” for membership. There is no necessity to subsume these findings under the heading of “recognition” as that concept is understood in international law in connection with the practice of states, although they are likely to be classified in this way by most observers, and it is convenient to use the word.\n\nThe Fund’s findings are made by its organs, and they are made solely for the purposes of the Fund. These limited purposes distinguish the findings from recognition among states. Of course, the Fund’s findings depend indirectly on the views of members. The Articles do not provide that governors or executive directors must act on the instructions or advice of authorities in the countries that appoint or elect them.39 It is likely, however, that in matters involving the recognition of countries, governors or executive directors are cautious and make certain that they obtain guidance. It is also likely that in difficult cases guidance will not be the sole responsibility of either the foreign office or the monetary authorities but will result from collaboration between them. In cases of exceptional difficulty, the position to be taken by a governor or executive director may be determined at the highest level of executive authority.\n\nWhatever may be the scope or force of guidance and therefore the effect of indirect influence by members, there is no legal principle that the organs of the Fund must take into account the action or inaction of members, other specialized agencies, or the United Nations. Membership in the World Bank depends on membership in the Fund,40 and therefore the two organizations collaborate closely in connection with findings of eligibility for membership. Nevertheless, there is no legal requirement of parallel action even by the Fund and the Bank.\n\nThe legal principle that the Fund makes its own findings has not induced it to make them in disregard of the facts of international life. Recognition by others is not a legal condition of membership, but it may be evidence that an applicant is a “country” and eligible for membership. The Fund pays attention to the steps to recognize the applicant that have been or are being taken by members, or by particular members, such as members in the region to which the applicant belongs. The Fund may take into account any action of the United Nations, other specialized agencies, or regional organizations. One reason why the Fund is interested in the action or inaction of members and of the United Nations is that there is a political element in findings of eligibility for membership. A political judgment may be necessary in applying the criteria of status as a “country” and the control of external relations. The Fund is not likely to look elsewhere, however, in deciding whether an applicant satisfies the criterion of ability to perform obligations under the Articles or under a membership resolution.\n\nThe practice in the Fund in response to an application when there is some doubt about the status of an applicant differs from the practice in the United Nations. The normal practice of the Secretary-General of the United Nations is to refrain from circulating an application about which he is doubtful because circulation would be taken to imply a finding on his part that the applicant was independent. He has circulated some applications when he was in doubt about the status of an applicant, but then only with some form of disclaimer or after a written request for circulation from a member state.41 For example, the application from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in 1949 was circulated with the following note:\n\nIn view of the General Assembly resolution of 12 December 1948, paragraph 2, the Secretary-General is circulating the following communication for the convenience of the members of the Security Council which may desire to be informed of it and not in the application of rule 6 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council.42\n\nIn the Fund, an application about which there is doubt is circulated at once to the Executive Directors, but there is likely to be no further action until the doubt is resolved.\n\nAlthough the Fund usually takes into account the recognition or nonrecognition of an entity as a state, there are no rules or even informal understandings on the extent to which an applicant must have been recognized by members or other international organizations before the Fund will regard it as eligible for membership. It would not be possible to reconcile all the findings that the Fund has made with any convention that an entity must have been recognized by the United Nations, or by particular members, or by some proportion of members, or by members having some proportion of the total voting power of members. The Fund has tended to avoid making a finding soon after the emergence of an entity if there was a substantial chance that the international community would regard the Fund as taking the lead in resolving a controversial political problem. This tendency is consistent with the Fund’s general attitude that it is a technical (or economic or financial) organization and not a political organization, and the Fund’s efforts to give practical expression to this view of itself have strengthened its influence within its own competence. Nevertheless, there have been occasions on which the Fund has made a finding before decisions had been taken by the United Nations or by most members or by members with a majority of the total voting power. On these occasions, there has usually been some special impetus, such as the need to give prompt assistance. For example, Bangladesh addressed an application to the Fund on February 18, 1972, when no more than 32 of the then 120 members, exercising about 48 per cent of the total voting power, had recognized Bangladesh. The application was not questioned.\n\nIt has been predicted that in time international organizations may perform a more creative role in connection with new states than they have in the past:\n\nThe instances in which international organizations play a part in the emergence or recognition of States are not yet numerous, and each time they do so, these activities take place in very special circumstances. But so tremendous are the implications of these activities, that if they are allowed to develop further, they may yet alter the entire structure of the international community. From being a mere servant of States, an international organization may yet change to become their creator and may, conceivably, prescribe, regulate and limit their scope, functions and boundaries. The contingency is far from certain, but so significant is the very chance of its coming about that the rudimentary developments pointing in this direction merit our special attention.43\n\nThe practice of the Fund, at least so far, provides no evidence in support of this prediction.\n\nThe Board of Governors has never refused to accept a recommendation of the Executive Directors that an applicant should be permitted to become a member, but some governors have abstained from voting on or have voted against a proposed resolution. Normally, governors do not explain why they have abstained or cast a negative vote, but sometimes it is possible to surmise that they have been motivated by political reasons. On a few occasions, they have even made their political reasons explicit. Decisions of the organs of the Fund to admit a country to membership are taken for the purposes of the Fund, and do not imply recognition of the country as a state by the members of the Fund.44 Nor does it imply recognition by them of the government of the applicant country. Similarly, the action of a governor in voting for or against the admission of an applicant in no way prejudices the position of the member that appointed him in connection with its own decisions on recognition. Countries have been admitted to membership even though they have not been recognized by some members or even by a large proportion of members. Nevertheless, even though governors have the opportunity to vote against the admission of a country because the members that appointed them do not recognize the applicant, there have been few negative votes or abstentions. It has been noted already that the Fund does not accept reservations of any kind by an applicant. The Fund could not accept a reservation by an applicant objecting to the membership of an existing member that the applicant does not recognize.\n\nResolution Before Independence\n\nUsually, the procedure leading to membership for newly emerging countries is initiated after they have attained independence. The Fund has been willing, however, to accelerate the procedure by dealing with an applicant that was still on its way to independence. The preamble of the membership resolution for Nigeria recites that on August 17, 1959 the Government of the Federation of Nigeria applied for admission upon attainment of constitutional independence and that independence was expected in October 1960. The resolution provided that Nigeria might accept membership on or after the date on which it attained constitutional independence but not later than March 31, 1961, with the usual provision authorizing the Executive Directors to extend the period.45 The resolution became effective on September 28, 1960, Nigeria attained independence on October 1, 1960, and the Articles were signed on behalf of Nigeria on March 30, 1961. Similar procedures were followed for Kenya,46 Ghana,47 and the Bahamas.48\n\nA territory that becomes independent becomes a nonmember. It is not absolved from the necessity to apply for membership, if it wishes to enter the Fund, because formerly a member had accepted the Articles in respect of the territory under Article XX, Section 2 (g). The procedure by which resolutions can be adopted before independence does not imply any exceptional treatment for these territories.49\n\nRecognition of Governments\n\nThe recognition of a government, as distinguished from the recognition of entities as “countries’’ eligible for membership or the recognition of changes in membership, has rarely been a problem for the Fund. A further distinction must be observed between questions of the recognition of governments and problems of the credentials of delegations attending meetings of the Board of Governors. A problem of credentials raises the formal question whether the appointments of a governor and an alternate governor have been signed by an appropriate person. A problem of the recognition of a government raises the question of the identity of the representatives of a member with whom the Fund should deal in the course of its activities, including its operations and transactions.\n\nAlmost invariably, the recognition of a new government, whether constitutional or unconstitutional, for the purposes of the Fund is made informally by the Managing Director and staff. These acts must be taken to be endorsed by the Executive Directors, with whom competence would rest to settle any doubtful or disputed claims. Only rarely have the Executive Directors had to exercise this competence.\n\nEffects of Change of Government\n\nThe occasions on which problems of recognition connected with operations and transactions have arisen have been uncommon, partly because of the way in which Article V, Section 1, is applied. The Fund’s normal practice is to regard communications as being in order if they are received from the fiscal agency that has been designated by a member under that provision and if the communications are authenticated in accordance with the agreement between the Fund and the member. The established channel continues to be proper until a new designation is made, even if political developments raise the question of the government that is to be recognized as representing the member.\n\nA change of government by a member is unlikely to affect its channels for dealing with the Fund, but it does not follow that the Fund’s operations and transactions with the member will be unaffected. The effect may be more acute if a change has been revolutionary, but it will be seen from a discussion of the consequences of a change of government on existing stand-by arrangements that a problem may arise even in connection with an orderly change.\n\nIn principle, recognition of the government of a member by the governments of other members is not a condition precedent to transactions by the member with the Fund. The state of affairs within a country, which may be responsible for non-recognition by other governments, may be germane to the Fund’s consideration of a request for a transaction. The request may be in order in the sense that it has been submitted by the member’s fiscal agency as the duly appointed channel through which to approach the Fund, but the member may be unable to demonstrate that it meets the Fund’s criteria for a transaction.\n\nThe Fund risks the criticism that its action is political if it accepts a new government’s request for a transaction or a stand-by arrangement at a time when some members might regard the Fund’s decision as premature because they themselves have not yet recognized the government. The Fund is subject to a similar risk if it postpones a decision at a time when some members have already recognized the government. To some extent, the risks are reduced because the decision on whether or not it is proper to negotiate is taken by the Managing Director, and his decision is based on economic and financial considerations. He does not have final authority on timing, however, because the issue can be transferred to the Executive Directors by a government’s formal request for a transaction or a stand-by arrangement. The Executive Directors are likely to support the judgment of the Managing Director, and it is improbable, therefore, that a government would try to force the pace.\n\nIf a stand-by arrangement is in existence, it remains effective notwithstanding a change of government, whether constitutional or unconstitutional. The Fund has no general policy that a new government should confirm the letter of intent of the predecessor government on the basis of which the Fund approved the stand-by arrangement. A policy requiring confirmation might imply that the obligations undertaken and assurances given on behalf of a member cease to be effective on a change of government. The Fund’s resources are not exposed to serious risk by the absence of confirmation, because the new government will be able to make purchases only if they are in accordance with the terms of the stand-by arrangement.50\n\nThe absence of a policy does not mean that confirmation is never sought by the Fund or volunteered by a new government. In some circumstances, it would be unreasonable to proceed without confirmation. If a government submits a letter of intent in support of its request for a stand-by arrangement but the government is replaced before the Executive Directors act on the request, the Managing Director is expected to ascertain that the letter of intent is endorsed by the new government, whether that government has taken office by an orderly or by a revolutionary process. Even if a change of government occurs after a stand-by arrangement has become effective, the new government may think it advisable to reassure the Fund that it endorses its predecessor’s letter.\n\nThe state of relations between members, or rather the absence of relations, may create a problem for the Fund in the conduct of its operations and transactions with a member even though nonrecognition by other members of the statehood or government of the member is irrelevant in law for the Fund. For example, if Patria wished to make a purchase of exchange from the Fund, the currency of Terra might be an appropriate currency for the Fund to sell to Patria under the Fund’s policies on transactions conducted through its General Account.51 Similarly, if Patria wished to use special drawing rights in order to obtain currency, it might be appropriate for the Fund, under the provisions and policies relating to the Special Drawing Account, to designate Terra to accept the transfer of special drawing rights and provide the currency.52 Terra might not recognize Patria as a state or it might not recognize the government of Patria. Because direct banking relations between the two members would be involved, the Fund would try to avoid selling Terra’s currency from the General Account to Patria in these circumstances, even though it would reject the proposition that there was any legal impediment to the transaction. The Fund took account of this difficulty, however, when the procedures relating to the Special Drawing Account were established, and arranged that, to the maximum extent possible, a participant designated by the Fund to receive a transfer of special drawing rights would not know the identity of the other party. The procedures involve instructions by the transferee of special drawing rights that the currency it provides be held at the disposal of the Fund at the depository named by the Fund, and instructions by the Fund to the depository to credit the currency to the account of the transferor at the depository.53 Subsequent reports on the operation of the Special Drawing Account are presented in such a way as to make it difficult to determine the parties to transactions.\n\nA change of government in a member country, whether orderly or revolutionary, may have little or no effect on the organs of the Fund. A change does not terminate the appointment of a governor or alternate governor of the Fund that was made by a predecessor government. Each governor and alternate governor serves for five years, but at the pleasure of the member appointing him, so that the government, whether new or not, may terminate an appointment and make another at any time.54\n\nAn executive director continues in office until his successor is appointed or elected.55 A change of government does not terminate the appointment of an appointed executive director, but he may be replaced at any time. A member that elected or helped to elect an executive director has no right to terminate his service, and he remains in office until the term of two years for which he was elected has expired.56 A member may be able to induce him to resign before his term expires, but the Articles give no member a right to require resignation.\n\nThe rules for the regular biennial elections of executive directors make it possible for a governor not to cast the number of votes allotted to the member that appointed him. If he abstains in this way, the number of votes he could have cast will not be included in the votes that can be cast by any executive director.57 If, however, the governor was appointed by an American Republic not entitled to appoint an executive director, the votes he could have cast will be deemed to have been cast for the candidate elected with the smallest number of votes in the election confined to the American Republics.58 Governors have abstained in some elections for political reasons. The governor appointed by Czechoslovakia abstained in the third, fourth, and fifth regular biennial elections held in 1950, 1952, and 1954; the governor appointed by Cuba abstained in the by-election held on May 15, 1962 and in the ninth regular biennial election of 1962; and the governor appointed by China abstained in the regular biennial election of 1972. As a result, no executive director could cast the number of votes allotted to Czechoslovakia or China, but an executive director did cast the number of votes allotted to Cuba.\n\nThe difference in the rules of election seems to have been the result of the desire of the American Republics to avoid a reduction of their combined voting strength. The operation of the rule may have been regarded as a special benefit for the American Republics, but, because of the state of relations between Cuba and other American Republics, the rule was not without its embarrassments for the executive director who was deemed to have been elected with the help of Cuba. His difficulties were increased when the Fund contemplated action against Cuba for failure to fulfill its obligations under the Articles.\n\nCompeting Governments\n\nSo far, the discussion of the recognition of governments has involved the problems that may arise for the Fund when a new government assumes control. Further problems arise when there are competing governments. The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 396 (V) on December 14, 1950, in which it dealt with the risk that the various organs of the United Nations might take different decisions in connection with the representation of a member state in the United Nations when more than one authority claimed to be the government representing the member. The resolution recited that the General Assembly was the organ in which the views of all member states on the functioning of the Organization as a whole can best be given. It recommended, therefore, that any controversial question of representation should be considered by the General Assembly, or by its Interim Committee if the General Assembly is not in session, that the question should be considered in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter and the circumstances of each case, and that the attitude of the General Assembly or its Interim Committee should be taken into account in other organs of the United Nations and in the specialized agencies. The Secretary-General was requested to transmit the resolution to the other organs of the United Nations and to the specialized agencies “for such action as may be appropriate.”\n\nResolution 396 (V) does not purport to declare that the attitude of the General Assembly on a disputed question of representation would bind the specialized agencies, of which the Fund is one. The Agreement between the United Nations and the Fund recognizes that “[b]y reason of the nature of its international responsibilities and the terms of its Articles of Agreement, the Fund is, and is required to function as, an independent international organization.”59 Under that Agreement, any communication from the United Nations pursuant to Resolution 396 (V) would be brought to the immediate attention of the Executive Directors.\n\nAt each annual meeting of the Board of Governors in the five years 1950–54 the governor of the Fund for Czechoslovakia challenged the credentials of the governor for China on the ground that the Republic of China lacked the authority to appoint a governor. In 1950, the Joint Procedures Committee of the Board of Governors also had before it a cable to the Managing Director from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People’s Government of the People’s Republic of China in which he stated that his government was the sole legal government and that other delegates were not qualified to participate on behalf of China in the meetings and organs of the Fund. On these occasions, it was decided to take no action on the proposed resolutions and point of order, and no action has been taken subsequently.60\n\nA question formulated as a question of credentials may go beyond the procedural issue of attendance at meetings and raise the issue of the legitimacy of the government appointing persons to attend a meeting. In the Fund, a special majority is not required for decisions on any of these questions, and they can be taken, therefore, by a majority of the votes cast.61 A question of credentials or of representation is not a question of the compulsory withdrawal of a member, and therefore the power to decide the question is not within the power reserved to the Board of Governors to require a member to withdraw.62 A decision to compel withdrawal can be taken by the Board of Governors only by a majority of the governors representing a majority of the total voting power.63\n\nIn February 1950, the executive director elected by Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia objected on behalf of the first two of these members to the participation in the organs of the Fund of the governor and the executive director appointed by the Republic of China, and moved that these appointments be regarded as invalid. The Executive Directors decided that it was appropriate to await decision of such a question by the Board of Governors, and that the Executive Directors were not in a position to make a recommendation at that time. The executive director, who was a national of Czechoslovakia, withdrew from the meeting and refused to participate in the work of the Executive Directors until his motion was adopted. In withdrawing, he explained that if his alternate took part in the deliberations of the Executive Directors he would not be expressing the views of Czechoslovakia and Poland. The alternate, a national of Yugoslavia, continued to participate and was entitled to cast the number of votes allotted to all three members. His government had recognized the Central Government of the People’s Republic of China. No other incident of the kind has occurred in the history of the Fund.\n\nIndividual Membership and Regionalism\n\nMembership in the Fund is available to countries individually. No provision is made for the joint membership of two or more countries that remain distinct political entities as countries. Even countries that have a common currency have separate membership in the Fund. The Fund’s reaction to the amalgamation of Egypt and Syria to form the United Arab Republic, which is considered in Chapter 13, is not a true exception to the rule because the two former members were deemed to have become one country, although in many respects they were to be treated temporarily as if they had remained two countries.\n\nWith one exception, the Articles make no special provision for regionalism in any form. The exception relates to the American Republics not entitled to appoint executive directors, which are assured the right to elect two directors and can participate only in the election of those directors. Under powers in the Articles, the Board of Governors has increased this number to three since the sixth regular biennial election (1956).64 Proposals at the Bretton Woods Conference to assure the countries “in the economic area of the British Empire” of the right to elect three directors and the countries of the Middle East one director were rejected.65 In more recent years, countries in Africa have argued that they should have the right to elect two directors, but this assurance can be given only by an amendment of the Articles.66\n\nThe right of the American Republics to a minimum number of elected directors remains unique. The number of American Republics eligible to participate in the election may vary, not only with the entry of American Republics into the Fund but also with a change in the status of an existing member of the Fund. Guyana became a member of the Fund on September 26, 1966 after having become independent on May 26, 1966. On February 23, 1969 Guyana became a republic, although it continued to belong to the Commonwealth. As a republic, it was eligible to vote only with the other American Republics not entitled to appoint executive directors.\n\nAlthough the Articles make no provision for regionalism, with the one exception that has been mentioned, the Fund, in considering a country’s application to become a member, may pay special attention to the recognition of the applicant by members of the Fund in the same area. Executive directors are often elected by regional groupings of countries. Members in some regions arrange to concert the positions they will take in the Fund through their governors or through their executive director or directors.\n\nNo request has ever been made for a combined membership of two or more applicants, even by countries that shared a common currency when they applied for membership. The nearest approach to a request for a combined membership came from Tanganyika, Uganda, and Kenya. They belonged to a common market, shared a common currency, and aspired to federation. They were eager to have equal quotas, and they suggested that if the Fund could not agree to equal quotas when examining their individual applications, it might establish a single figure for the area as a whole, with the three applicants then sharing that amount in equal proportions. The Fund did not follow the latter course, but was able to agree to equal quotas on the basis of its traditional procedures.\n\nAlthough the Fund permits only individual membership, countries that are closely associated with each other, and for this reason wish to have equal quotas or quotas determined in some special way, may apply at roughly the same time. Groups of countries have done this and therefore have enabled the Fund to consider their applications contemporaneously. In this way, the Fund can pay special attention to the wishes of applicants.\n\nIt will be apparent from what has been said that an applicant’s close association with another country or with other countries, whether the association exists de jure because of a treaty or de facto, is not incompatible with separate membership. There are many examples of close association, going back to Belgium and Luxembourg among original members. The association of groups of independent member states of the French Community and France for the pursuit of a common policy with respect to certain common interests, including those relating to economic and financial policy and currency, are examples of more recent origin.\n\nControl of Foreign Relations and Capacity to Perform Obligations\n\nApplications of Italy, Austria, Germany, and Japan\n\nThe Fund’s reactions to the applications of Italy, Austria, Germany, and Japan have influenced the development of criteria for membership in general. It is not clear, however, whether some of the problems connected with these applications related to the criterion of the control of foreign relations or the criterion of ability to perform the obligations of membership.\n\nItaly\n\nWhen Italy’s application was considered at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Governors in March 1946, the governor for Greece, supported by the governor for Yugoslavia, “questioned whether Italy, as a former enemy country which has not yet signed a peace treaty, should be entitled to apply for membership.” The Board of Governors decided that the communication questioning Italy’s eligibility for membership would be considered when the Board dealt with the application again, but that meanwhile the Executive Directors should examine the technical aspects of the application.67\n\nThe next occasion on which the Board of Governors had Italy’s application on its agenda was the first annual meeting of the Board in September and October 1946. The issue was raised in the Committee on Membership of the Board of Governors,68 which was considering the draft resolution recommended by the Executive Directors. Yugoslavia’s view, as expressed in the committee’s report, was that “former enemy countries should not be admitted in advance of even neutral countries, and before it is possible to see clearly the economic and financial position of the country and its obligations with respect to the United Nations which suffered from that country’s aggression.” The Yugoslav delegate “stressed the fact that an unhurried and unanimous decision on the case would be preferable, especially as a peace treaty might be signed in the near future.” 69 The problem raised by Yugoslavia seems to have been whether it was sound policy to admit a former enemy country before a treaty of peace had been signed and not the legal question whether Italy met the criteria for membership, but this distinction was not drawn in the subsequent discussion of the application.\n\nThe delegate of the United States expressed the opinion, according to the committee’s report, that there was “nothing in international law which would render Italy incompetent to accept membership” in the Fund:\n\nThe status of co-belligerent was granted to Italy by the Allies as early as October 1943, and all but two of the United Nations have now extended, in one form or another, diplomatic recognition to the Italian Government. Moreover, in view of Italy’s contribution to the war against Germany and the status of the new Italian Government, the Allies undertook to relax the Armistice terms previously imposed upon Italy.\n\nIt is highly desirable to bring Italy back into the international economic community. Some steps have already been taken in this direction with the readmittance of Italy to membership in the International Labor Office in 1945, and with the trade and other agreements concluded by the United States and other powers with Italy.\n\nThe admission of Italy in the Fund is desirable not only from the point of view of the applicant country, but also from the point of view of the rest of the world economic community and of the Fund itself.70\n\nThese views were supported by the delegate of the United Kingdom, “with the proviso, agreed to by the member [of the committee] for the United States, that in view of the special circumstances surrounding the Italian case, the admission of Italy would not constitute a precedent for the admission of any other former enemy country.”71 The committee decided to recommend to the Board of Governors that it adopt the draft resolution, but with the proviso referred to.\n\nThe Yugoslav delegate dissented, declaring “(1) that the motion of Yugoslavia for postponement is not directed against the Italian people, but was made for the reason that an ex-enemy country cannot be accepted in the Fund before it has concluded a peace treaty; and, (2) that the delegation from Yugoslavia reserves its right to express its position toward this decision at a later opportunity.”72 The Board of Governors acted in accordance with the committee’s recommendation on October 2, 1946.\n\nIn relation to later applications, what was interesting about the absence of a peace treaty was not that fact in isolation, but the extent of Italy’s ability to control its foreign relations and perform the obligations of membership under the Articles, because the extent of that ability was accepted, at least implicitly, as adequate for the purposes of membership. The Conditions of the Armistice with Italy entered into force on September 3, 1943 and declared in paragraph 12: “Other conditions of a political, economic and financial nature with which Italy will be bound to comply will be transmitted at a later date.” 73 These conditions were among the terms of the Instrument of Surrender that entered into force on September 29, 1943. Article 23 of the Instrument dealt with monetary matters and provided that the Italian Government “will take such measures as may be required by the United Nations for the control of banks and business in Italian territory, for the control of foreign exchange and foreign commercial and financial transactions and for the regulation of trade and production and will comply with any instructions issued by the United Nations regarding these and similar matters.” Under Article 24 of the Instrument, “There shall be no financial, commercial or other intercourse with or dealings with or for the benefit of countries at war with any of the United Nations or territories occupied by such countries or any other foreign country except under authorisation of the Allied Commander-in-Chief or designated officials.” 74\n\nThe relaxation of the Conditions of the Armistice referred to in the Committee on Membership of the Board of Governors was contained in an Aide-Mémoire of February 24, 1945 from the President of the Allied Commission to the Italian Government. The Aide-Mémoire confirmed that the Italian Government could continue to have direct relations with foreign diplomatic representatives, but would keep the Commission informed of all negotiations completed or pending with other governments. The Commission would limit its dealings to consultation and advice, and it would not be necessary for the Italian Government to obtain the approval of the Commission for decrees and other legislation. An official Commentary on the Aide-Mémoire made the following points with respect to Articles 23 and 24 of the Conditions of the Armistice:\n\nArticle 23: The Italian Government has been informed that the Allied Commission will no longer intervene in Italian internal financial affairs (except in cases of Allied military necessity) and that, with certain exceptions in Italy’s own interest, the Italian Government need no longer obtain the approval of the Allied Commission prior to the execution of external financial transactions. The Italian Government is now free to fix or negotiate exchange rates for the lira without prior consultation with the Allied Commission.\n\nArticle 24: Private export trade may now be resumed and all types of commercial and financial correspondence may now go forward from Italy to the non-enemy world, subject to the Italian Government putting into force certain trade control measures similar to those employed by the United Nations against enemy interests.75\n\nThe Conditions of the Armistice, the Instrument of Surrender, and the Aide-Mémoire were published on November 6, 1945, which means that their contents were known when the Board of Governors adopted its resolution on membership for Italy. The treaty of peace with Italy was not signed until February 10, 1947, and did not come into force until September 15, 1947.\n\nIn the course of the drafting of the membership resolution, suggestions were made that the Fund should reserve the right to review and modify the terms of the resolution after a treaty of peace had been signed. It was also pointed out that the Articles contained references to a member’s territory and that until a treaty had been signed it could not be known whether there would be changes in the territory of Italy. No reference to these topics was included in the draft resolution recommended by the Executive Directors or in the resolution as adopted by the Board of Governors. The report of the Executive Directors on the applications of Italy, Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey included the following passage: “The Executive Directors recommend that the four countries be admitted to membership, the admission of Italy being subject to a determination by the Board of Governors that a former enemy country which has not yet signed a peace treaty is entitled to membership.” When the Board of Governors was considering the resolution, the governor for Yugoslavia moved that a former enemy country should not be admitted to membership in the absence of a peace treaty, but there was no second for the motion. The word “entitled” should not be understood as a finding that the Fund must admit countries to membership unless there is some legal disqualification. The word referred only to the question whether the absence of a peace treaty was a legal disqualification.\n\nAustria\n\nAustria applied for membership on August 20, 1947, at a time when it was under quadripartite occupation, and the question of eligibility was considered in more detail than on the occasion of Italy’s application. The staff advised that Austria qualified as a “country” within the meaning of Article II, Section 2, and that “[i]n the context of the whole Agreement, status as an international person with a territory subject to control by a regularly constituted group representing a people with a community interest would seem to be implied in this provision.”\n\nThe agreement of June 28, 1946 among the Governments of France, the United Kingdom, the U. S. S. R., and the United States on the machinery of control in Austria provided that the authority of the Austrian Government extended fully throughout Austria subject to certain reservations, such as the reservation of the right of the four powers to give directions and to act directly in certain specified matters connected with military aims. Under the agreement, the Allied organization consisted of various elements that constituted the Allied Commission, at the head of which was an Allied Council to which each of the four powers was entitled to appoint a High Commissioner. The authority of the Allied Commission in matters affecting Austria as a whole was exercised by the Allied Council, or by other elements of the Allied Commission to which authority was delegated. All decisions were taken by unanimity. In the absence of action by the Allied Council, each High Commissioner was empowered to act independently in his own zone in various matters, including in particular those on which the Allied Commission was able to act directly.\n\nAll legislative measures as defined by the Allied Council and all international agreements that Austria wished to make, except agreements with one of the four powers, had to be submitted to the Allied Council before they took effect. For constitutional laws, the written approval of the Allied Council was necessary. With respect to all other legislative measures and international agreements, the Austrian Government might assume that the Allied Council had given its approval if within 31 days of the time of receipt of the measure or agreement by the Allied Commission the Government had not been informed of any objection by the Commission. The Allied Council might inform the Government at any time of the disapproval of any legislative measure or administrative action, and might direct that the measure or action be canceled or amended. The Austrian Government was free to establish diplomatic and consular relations with the governments of the United Nations. Diplomatic and consular relations with other governments were subject to the prior approval of the Allied Council. The agreement made no special mention of Austria’s currency, but the National Bank of Austria was recognized as the issuing authority.\n\nThe staff concluded, with emphasis on Austria’s membership in other international organizations and on its international relations, that Austria had the capacity to become a member of the Fund and that the absence of a treaty of peace was not a legal obstacle. The staff gave more attention, however, to the question whether Austria would be able to perform the obligations of membership, because it did not dispose of the full powers of government. The staff’s conclusion was that while the powers of the Allied Commission to require the Government to follow the directions of the Commission might “constitute a severe limitation with respect to Austrian affairs,” the effect on Austria’s ability to perform its obligations under the Articles appeared “at present … to be slight.” Among the four powers, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States were members of the Fund, and “it is at least questionable whether they could legitimately participate in a decision to direct Austria to act in violation” of the Articles. It was recognized, however, that the authority of a High Commissioner to act in his zone in the absence of unanimity in the Allied Commission constituted “a potential limitation” on Austria’s ability to perform its obligations.\n\nThe limitation on Austria’s legislative authority appeared to the staff to be just as slight. The Allied Council had the right to veto proposed legislation and international agreements but only by a unanimous decision. In practice, the right was an obstacle only rarely. The staff was aware of two occasions on which, in the absence of a unanimous decision, the U. S. S. R. had prevented Austrian legislation from becoming effective in the Russian zone.\n\nThe staff concluded that Austria met the criteria for membership unless the Allied Council, by unanimous decision, were to object to Austria’s assumption of membership. The opinion was based on a mixed finding of law and practice, with practice, or probable practice, compensating for what might have been regarded as uncertainties in the legal position. The decision of the Fund was undoubtedly animated by a policy of broad membership for the Fund and a desire to bring Austria and perhaps other formerly hostile countries into the community of membership in the Fund as soon as possible. It was recognized that the occupation arrangements, in principle at least, might produce difficulties, but it was held that this possibility should not be regarded as amounting to legal incapacity. If difficulties should occur because obligations were not observed, the Fund would have to deal with these failures according to the circumstances of each of them. The difference in the treatment of the applications of Italy and Austria is that the Fund was explicit in its consideration of the limits on Austria’s powers and in its pragmatic approach to membership.\n\nIn the examination of Austria’s application, the view was registered once again on behalf of Yugoslavia that no country should be admitted to membership before it had signed a treaty of peace and before it was possible to see clearly what the economic and financial position of the country and its obligations to the United Nations would be. It was made clear that this position was based on the economic uncertainties that resulted from the absence of a treaty of peace and not on some legal or political principle.76\n\nGermany\n\nThe Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany submitted an application on behalf of the Federal Republic in a letter, dated February 7, 1951, addressed to the Managing Director and transmitted by the Secretary-General of the Allied High Commission for Germany. The Federal Republic had been established on September 21, 1949. Its territory was still occupied by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States at the time of the application, and the Federal Government’s authority in domestic and foreign affairs was subject to the regulations of the occupying powers. Under the Potsdam Agreement of 1945, the U. S. S. R. was to participate in the joint administration of German territories, which were to be a single economic unit and subject to the common policies of the four occupying powers in currency and banking, among other matters. Although the agreement had not been abrogated, it was generally considered to have collapsed, and it was ignored in the Fund’s consideration of Germany’s application for membership.\n\nThe three occupying powers, “in the exercise of the supreme authority” that they retained, proclaimed the Occupation Statute, and amended it with effect from March 7, 1951, as the principal document by which their relations with Germany were defined. Under it, the three powers declared that they desired and intended the German people to enjoy “self-government to the maximum possible degree consistent with” the occupation. The Federal State and the Länder were to have, subject only to the limitations of the Statute, full legislative, executive, and judicial powers in accordance with the Basic Law of the Republic and with the respective constitutions of the Länder. Authority in certain matters was specifically reserved to the occupying powers. Among these matters were the following:\n\n(c) foreign affairs, including international agreements made by or on behalf of Germany; but the powers reserved in this field will be exercised so as to permit the Federal Republic to conduct relations with foreign countries to the full extent compatible with the requirements of security, other reserved powers, and obligations of the Occupying Powers relating to Germany. …\n\n(g) control over foreign trade and exchange to the extent necessary:\n\n(1) to meet the needs of security;\n\n(2) to ensure the observance by the Federal Republic of the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, until the Federal Republic has become a party to the Agreement and assumed the obligations thereunder;\n\n(3) to ensure the observance by the Federal Republic of the principles and practices of the International Monetary Fund Agreement and to control its exchange rate, until the Federal Republic has become a member of the Fund and assumed satisfactory obligations thereunder with respect to its exchange rate;\n\n(4) to provide for orderly settlement of claims against Germany.77\n\nIn the Occupation Statute as proclaimed by the three powers on April 8, 1949, the provisions corresponding to (c) and (g) above had read:\n\n(c) foreign affairs, including international agreements made by or on behalf of Germany; …\n\n(g) control over foreign trade and exchange.78\n\nThe amendment of March 7, 1951 with respect to (g) had been made in order to assist Germany to become a member of the Fund.\n\nThe three powers declared in the Occupation Statute that it was their hope and expectation that the occupation authorities (the Allied High Commission) would not have occasion to take action in fields other than those specifically reserved in the Statute. The occupation authorities reserved the right, however, acting on the instructions of their governments, “to resume, in whole or in part, the exercise of full authority if they consider that to do so is essential to security or to preserve democratic government in Germany or in pursuance of the international obligations of their governments. Before so doing, they will formally advise the appropriate German authorities of their decision and of the reasons therefor.” 79\n\nThe Federal Government and the governments of the Länder had the power, after notifying the occupation authorities, to legislate or act in the fields reserved to these authorities, except as the occupation authorities might specifically direct, or except as the legislation or action would be inconsistent with decisions or actions taken by the occupation authorities.\n\nAny amendment of the Basic Law required the approval of the occupation authorities before it could become effective. Any agreement between the Federal Republic and a foreign government would become effective 21 days after its official receipt by the occupation authorities unless it was disapproved by them during this period or had been previously disapproved. Constitutions of the Länder, amendments of them, and all other federal legislation or legislation of the Länder would become effective without review by the occupation authorities, but would be subject to repeal or annulment by them.\n\nThe occupation authorities declared that they would not disapprove any agreement between the Federal Republic and a friendly country or repeal or annul legislation unless in their opinion it was inconsistent with the Occupation Statute or with legislation or other measures of the occupation authorities or constituted a grave threat to the basic purposes of the occupation.\n\nAfter 12 and within 18 months of March 7, 1951, the three powers would undertake a review of the provisions of the amended Statute in the light of experience “and with a view to extending the jurisdiction of the German authorities in the legislative, executive and judicial fields.” 80\n\nThe staff of the Fund, in advising the membership committee, examined two questions, Germany’s qualification for membership in view of the occupation and Germany’s ability to perform the obligations of the Articles. On the first question, the conclusion was that Germany was a “country,” and even though its external and economic affairs might be affected by the control and intervention of the occupying powers, there was no reason to assume that this control or intervention would be exercised in a manner that would disqualify Germany for membership. The analogies of Italy and Austria were noted, although there were differences in the international positions of the three countries. The conclusion once again, therefore, was a pragmatic one, based on the likelihood that the occupying powers would not interfere with Germany’s performance of the obligations of membership. In this conclusion, as in the two earlier cases, the Fund avoided a dogmatic requirement of legally unhampered independence in foreign or domestic affairs, and the line between the criteria based on the control of foreign relations and observance of the obligations of the Articles was less than clear cut.\n\nOn May 26, 1952, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States entered into Contractual Agreements with the Federal Republic, which were to take effect on ratification by all signatory powers. Under the Agreements, the Occupation Statute was to be abrogated, the Allied High Commission was to be abolished, and the Federal Republic was to be released from all control over its internal and external affairs and enter the community of free nations as an equal partner, subject only to the retention by the three Western powers of certain defined rights in connection with the stationing of armed forces and their security, Berlin, the unification of Germany, and the peace settlement. The membership resolution for Germany was submitted to the Board of Governors on April 30, 1952 and became effective on May 28, 1952. Germany became a member of the Fund on August 14 of that year. The Contractual Agreements, which with amendments agreed on October 23, 1954 became effective on May 5, 1955,81 did not enter into the Fund’s consideration of the application. The eligibility of Germany for membership was determined, therefore, on the basis of the Occupation Statute.\n\nOnly one member, Czechoslovakia, objected to the resolution, on the grounds that membership for “West Germany” was inconsistent with the arrangements under the agreement of the four powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the U. S. S. R.) and that only a united Germany would be eligible for membership.\n\nJapan\n\nGermany’s application for membership on February 7, 1951 was followed on August 9 of the same year by an application from Japan, which was transmitted to the Fund by the Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. The two applications were considered concurrently and resolutions for both countries became effective on May 28, 1952. Japan became a member on August 13, 1952 and Germany on the next day.\n\nDrafts of a peace treaty had been transmitted in March and July 1951 to the countries that had been most closely concerned with the war against Japan, and a treaty was signed at the San Francisco Peace Conference by the representatives of 49 countries on September 8, 1951. The treaty did not become effective until April 28, 1952, and therefore the eligibility of Japan was examined by the staff and the committee in relation to the occupation that was still in existence, although the terms and impending effectiveness of the treaty of peace had an obvious effect in the consideration of the application. It was concluded, as in the case of Germany, that Japan was a “country” and had an international status that made it eligible for membership even though it did not exercise full control over its domestic and external affairs. The Far Eastern Commission, composed of the representatives of 11 countries, including the U. S. S. R., had broad functions connected with the occupation. These functions included the formulation, for the guidance of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, of policies designed to ensure the fulfillment by Japan of the terms of surrender. A policy adopted by the Far Eastern Commission on June 19, 1947 was of particular pertinence for the Fund:\n\nControl is to be maintained over all imports and exports of goods and foreign exchange and financial transactions. The Far Eastern Commission shall formulate the policies and principles governing exports from and imports to Japan. The Far Eastern Commission will formulate the policies to be followed in the exercise of these controls.82\n\nThe Commission had the power also to review, on the request of any member, any directive issued by the Supreme Commander or any action taken by the Supreme Commander involving policy decisions within the jurisdiction of the Commission. Decisions of the Commission might be taken by less than unanimous vote, provided that an action was concurred in by at least a majority of all the representatives and that the majority included the representatives of China, the United Kingdom, the U. S. S. R., and the United States.\n\nThe U. S. Government was given a special role. It prepared directives in accordance with the policy decisions of the Commission and transmitted them to the Supreme Commander through the appropriate U. S. agency. The Supreme Commander was charged with putting the directives into operation. If the Commission decided that any directive or action reviewed by it should be modified, the decision of the Commission was to be regarded as a policy decision. The U. S. Government had the authority also to issue interim directives to the Supreme Commander, pending action by the Commission, whenever urgent matters arose that were not covered by the policies already formulated by the Commission; but on certain matters, including fundamental changes in the regime of control, directives could be issued only after consultation with and the agreement of the Commission.\n\nAn Allied Council was established under the chairmanship of the Supreme Commander (or his deputy) and consisting, in addition to the chairman, of a member for the U. S. S. R., a member for China, and one representing the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India jointly. The Supreme Commander had the authority to issue all orders for implementing the Terms of Surrender, the occupation and control of Japan, and directives supplementary thereto. Action was to be carried out under and through the Supreme Commander, who was to be the sole executive authority for the Allied Powers in Japan. He was to consult and advise with the Allied Council in advance of the issuance of orders on matters of substance, if the exigencies of the situation permitted, and his decisions on these matters were to be controlling. If, in connection with the implementation of policy decisions of the Commission on certain matters, including a change in the regime of control, a member of the Council disagreed with the Supreme Commander (or his deputy), the Supreme Commander would withhold issuance of orders on these questions pending agreement on them in the Commission.\n\nThe staff’s examination of the eligibility of Japan for membership concentrated on the role of the Supreme Commander. It was implied that the majority and special participation required for decisions of the Commission would not be serious impediments to the exercise of his authority. As the result of an informal suggestion by the General Counsel of the Fund, action that corresponded to the amendment of the Occupation Statute for Germany was taken to emphasize that the Japanese authorities would be able in practice to perform the obligations of the Articles without interference by the occupation authorities. The application for membership by Japan was accompanied by a letter in which the Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander stated:\n\nRelative to this application the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers states that the Japanese Government is authorized to apply for membership in the International Monetary Fund, and if offered membership, to accept the articles of agreement and all the terms prescribed in the membership resolution. The Japanese Government is also authorized to take all steps necessary to enable it to carry out all its obligations under the articles of agreement and the membership resolution. The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers not only has no objection to the assumption of such obligations by the Japanese Government, but heartily endorses and is fully sympathetic with the aspirations of the Japanese people and Government to participate in the International Monetary Fund. The obligations to be assumed by the Japanese Government include, according to present practice, the obligation that in the period between accepting membership and agreeing on an initial par value, Japan will not change its exchange rates prevailing at the time of accepting membership without prior approval of the Fund.\n\nIt is the duty of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers to maintain general surveillance over the activities of the Japanese Government until a treaty of peace becomes effective. It is, therefore, to be understood that the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers’ authority remains unimpaired. However, that authority will not be exercised in the financial field other than to strengthen the Japanese Government in fulfilling its functions in and obligations to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe governor for Czechoslovakia voted against adoption of the membership resolution on the ground that the San Francisco agreement on a peace treaty was inconsistent with various international agreements and declarations. Japan was a state with which peaceful relations had not yet been re-established, and therefore it could not be admitted to membership.\n\nReflections on Resolutions for Italy, Austria, Germany, and Japan\n\nThe resolutions permitting membership for Italy, Austria, Germany, and Japan raise the question of the precise criteria for membership that the Fund applies, or, more properly, the relationship of those resolutions to the criteria that became established in later years. No serious problems have arisen in connection with the criterion that an applicant must be a “country,” although the boundaries of the territory that would be under the control of the applicant were not clear in any of the four cases when the resolutions were adopted, and it was known that a substantial part of Germany’s pre-war territory would not be under the control of the Government of the Federal Republic when it became a member.\n\nThe character of the control exercised by the governments of the four applicants raises an even more interesting legal question than the effect of uncertainty about the area within which the governments exercised control. These countries were occupied, and the governments were subject to the control of the occupying authorities, in varying degrees, in the conduct of both foreign and domestic affairs. In the discussion of the applications there were dicta to the effect that “full” independence was not a criterion for membership. This alleged principle is unsatisfying, not only because it would be necessary to decide how much independence, short of full independence, could be deemed sufficient, but also because independence that is less than complete connotes some dependence on others or some authority vested in others. The word “authority” raises at once the question of eligibility because of its appearance in Article XX, Section 2 (g). A territory under the “authority” of a country is not itself eligible for membership. There was no challenge to the application of any one of the four countries on the ground that Article XX, Section 2 (g), precluded membership. Similarly, there was no challenge on the ground that, in view of the possibility of interference by the occupying powers, an occupied country could not make the representation that it had taken all steps necessary to enable it to carry out all its obligations under the Articles.\n\nIn the subsequent practice of the Fund, sovereignty as a criterion has been avoided, and, as noted already, there has even been a reluctance to use the word “independence.” This practice and the Fund’s response to the applications of Italy, Austria, Germany, and Japan have been a tacit endorsement of Professor O’Connell’s view on sovereignty: “It could be argued that sovereignty as a concept is of decreasing value, and that attention should be paid instead to the various faculties of government which make up the totality of legal competence. It is possible for some of these faculties to be assigned to another political entity and for some of them to be retained.” 83\n\nThis view had been stated more elaborately in the first edition of his book on international law:\n\nSovereignty is not to be equated with legal irresponsibility. In no sense is it “absolute” and at the present time the term is apt to mislead as to the actual capacities inherent in independent States. For example, the United Arab Republic had political power but Egypt and Syria had fiscal power; Malaya also has political power but shares with other South-East Asian territories a monetary unit which is beyond its manipulatory power. Independence, then, means competence, but not necessarily the complete competence which has been traditionally predicated of sovereign States. Recognition of this has led some to propose that sovereignty is a redundant conception which the law would be better to dispense with. This, however, is unacceptable. Some term is necessary to indicate plenitude of legal capacity, and if we dispensed with the term “sovereignty” we should have to invent another to take its place. Whenever territory is reduced to legal power some entity must be isolated as its sovereign, or the capacities which make up sovereignty must be located in specific actors even if divided among them. No territory, unless it be terra nullius is without sovereignty in this sense. The entity which has the ultimate capacity of disposing of the territory may be said to possess “titular” or “residual” sovereignty, the entity which exercises plenary power over the territory but lacks the capacity of ultimate disposal may be said to possess “effective” sovereignty. The two together, residual and effective powers, make up the totality of sovereignty. Similarly, two or more entities may exercise divided functions, and this may give rise either to “dual,” “divided” or “distributed” sovereignty, depending upon whether the actors must act jointly or may act separately within defined spheres of competence.84\n\nIt is particularly interesting to note that the examples cited in this passage are drawn from the experience of the Fund. They are discussed in later chapters of this study.\n\nThe main focus of the Fund’s examination of the four applications was on the question whether the obligations under the Articles and the membership resolutions were likely to be performed. In finding that the prospects for performance were good enough, although not certain beyond question, the Fund followed two lines of thought. One was that the circumstances made it unlikely that the occupying powers would hinder the performance of obligations should the applicant become a member. The necessity for joint action by all occupying powers, including the U. S. S. R., is an example of a fact that influenced the judgment of the Fund. The other line of thought was that some of the occupying powers were themselves members of the Fund and therefore unlikely to prevent the performance of obligations. The issue was not raised whether it would be legal for them as members of the Fund to interfere with the performance of another member’s obligations. The assurances the Fund received in one form or another that the occupying powers would not interfere with the performance of obligations may have induced it to forgo inquiry into the legal question. There was, of course, a strong disposition to bring the four countries into the Fund, and it seemed improbable that there would be problems for the Fund because of their special circumstances. The general attitude was that if, notwithstanding the outlook, problems did arise, it would be better to resolve them with members than to interpose the theoretical possibility of problems as a reason for delaying or refusing membership. The Fund’s pragmatic attitude to these applications has been a feature of much of its subsequent practice, as will be seen in the next chapter."
