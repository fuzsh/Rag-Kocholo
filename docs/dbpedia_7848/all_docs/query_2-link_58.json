        "text": "On March 29, 2023, Liechtenstein published draft legislation for the implementation of the Pillar Two GloBE Rules.\n\nA new GloBE Act is to be enacted which will provide for:\n\n– the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR);\n\n– the Under-Taxed Payments Rule (UTPR); and\n\n– a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT).\n\nThe IIR and QDMTT are to apply to in-scope MNE groups for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024.

An Ordinance to accompany the GloBE Law is to make them legally binding.\n\nAs Liechtenstein is member of the EEA, large domestic groups are also be included in the scope of the GloBE Rules.\n\nGiven the standard corporate income tax rate in Liechtenstein is 12.5% (under Article 61 of the Law on State and Municipal Taxes), domestic entities/PEs of foreign MNE groups and large domestic groups are likely to be subject to top-up tax (unless there are significant differences between domestic and GloBE treatment).\n\nThe Draft Law is subject to a consultation until 2 June 2023, with final legislation to be sent to Parliament at the beginning of September 2023.\n\nWe look at some of the key aspects of the Draft GloBE Law below.\n\nThe draft legislation is available at:"
