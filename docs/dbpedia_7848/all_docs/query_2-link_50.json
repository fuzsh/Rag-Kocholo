        "text": "The International Office is responsible for informing, advising and supporting students, staff and lecturers on all matters related to study, internships and teaching abroad. We offer help in finding suitable programmes for incoming and outgoing exchange students and guide you through the application process. We also provide support to our international degree seeking students and guests of the University.\n\nRiga is a diverse city and has a lot to offer. There are many meeting places, cafés and parks. The cultural offer is large and exciting, especially with our village life. The course content is different from that at the University of Liechtenstein. In addition to the studio, we also had drawing and painting as well as outdoor furniture and regional landscape. The courses were all manageable and we finished them with lectures and presentations of our work.\n\nValeria, Riga\n\nThe learning outcomes are strongly connected to knowledge in professional contexts, materiality, processes, sustainability, inclusion, managing, and advanced competences in developing a design proposal. Working on the project during the week usually gives you the weekend off. Then there is time to visit places inside or outside of Copenhagen. Copenhagen has so much to offer that it takes some time to discover the city.\n\nLina, Denmark\n\nDownload the Erasmus+ App now!\n\nFurther information\n\nNetworks\n\nUniversity of Liechtenstein is integrated in the following networks:\n\nLake Constance Arts & Sciences Association\n\nIn the cantons and states around Lake Constance, in Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, outstanding academics conduct research and teaching at internationally renowned universities. By working together, the potential in the field of continuing education among the individual universities in this region can be better tapped and leveraged. University of Liechtenstein is a member of this association.\n\nIAESTE - Internships abroad\n\nIAESTE - International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience - was founded in 1948 to promote international understanding. Today it totals 60 member countries. IAESTE arranges for students from across the world and from a range of disciplines to spend several months on internships abroad. University of Liechtenstein is involved in this global exchange network and is an associate member of IAESE Switzerland. The International Office serves as the point of contact.\n\nEUCEN - European Universities Continuing Education Network\n\nSet up in 1991, EUCEN is a growing network of around 190 universities in 39 countries involved in continuing education at university level. Its main aims include promoting the initiative of \"life-long learning” and helping universities to reach their goal of becoming professional continuing education centres. University of Liechtenstein has been working with the EUCEN network since 1995.\n\nPartner universities\n\nPartner universities form a key component of University of Liechtenstein‘s worldwide network. With joint projects, student exchanges and visiting professors, its international activities continue to expand.\n\nThe International Office team is happy to answer any further questions.\n\nProjects\n\nDeveloping and conducting transnational educational and research projects with international universities and other partner institutions plays an important part in providing students, teaching faculty and researchers with an European and international dimension. Cooperating on international projects helps to channel innovation into teaching and research and also contributes to developing high-quality standards in educational programmes and products.\n\nInterreg IV\n\nMobility programmes\n\nActive participation in a range of international mobility programmes offers students, lecturers and researchers the opportunity to experience the benefits of a placement abroad. These mobility and exchange programmes are extremely important in providing a financial framework in many cases, and in enabling acceptance into the partnering university, as well as the academic recognition of study and research placements. To find out more, please read the European Policy Statement of the University of Liechtenstein.\n\nThe University of Liechtenstein is currently participating in the following mobility programmes:\n\nErasmus+\n\nEEA Grants\n\nInternational Staff Training Days\n\nThe University of Liechtenstein has become a hub for international students. The campus, located in the former Spoerry factory, offers an ideal setting for learning, research and project work to around 700 students from all over the world. Students come from more than 60 countries, primarily from Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. This makes the university a multicultural place of education and research. In order to build an intercultural learning and networking environment for our students, our International Office constantly seeks opportunities to compare good examples of working across cultures. This is why we would be honored to welcome you to our International Week.\n\nIn the past we had organised separate Staff Training Days for visiting staff. Nowadays we like to include visiting staff in the Introduction Weeks for students which we organise twice a year in February and September. During the Introduction Week we organise lots of different informational and cultural events such as company visits, dinners and speeches by government staff about Liechtenstein.\n\nMoreover, we aim to enlarge participants’ professional networks and provide hands-on learning experiences by offering job shadowing sessions with our staff. Programme participants might offer brief presentations based on their professional contexts.\n\nERASMUS Policy Statement"
