        "text": "History of UNSC Reform\n\nThe UN established\n\nFifty-one states ratified the Charter of the United Nations in October 1945, formally establishing the United Nations. The UN Charter had been drafted during the two month-long United Nations Conference on International Organization based on the proposals from representatives of the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States of America (USA) at Dumbarton Oaks from August to October 1944. The Charter provides for a veto power to five countries in the hope that it would ensure their participation in the UN and its Security Council. The UN Charter sets forth in Chapter V the composition and functions and powers of the UN Security Council (UNSC), in addition to its voting and procedures details.\n\nUN SECURITY COUNCIL REFORM\n\nThis timeline compiled from resources provided by the Global Policy Forum, the Global Center for the Responsibility to Protect, the Center for UN Reform at Timeline UN Security Council Reform, 1992- November 2015 and Governing & Managing Change at the United Nations and other sources\n\n2024-08-12 High-level Debate on “Addressing the historical injustice and enhancing Africa’s effective representation on the UN Security Council”\n\nOn 12 August, the Security Council convened for a high-level debate titled “Addressing the historical injustice and enhancing Africa’s effective representation on the UN Security Council” under the “Maintenance of international peace and security” agenda item. This is one of the signature events of Sierra Leone’s August Council presidency. Sierra Leonean President Julius Maada Bio is expected to chair the meeting. The anticipated briefers are UN Secretary-General António Guterres, President of the UN General Assembly Dennis Francis, and a representative of academia.\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n2024-05-24 Consultation on African Union's UNSC Reform Position\n\nA virtual consultation led by H.E. Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security (PAPS) of the African Union (AU), engaged African civil society organizations (CSOs) and stakeholders to advocate for the Common African Position on UNSC Reform.

Guterres lamented the lack of unity among council members, stating that it had severely undermined the council's authority. He noted the urgent need for reform in the council's composition and working methods. The United States recently vetoed a draft resolution for a ceasefire in Israel's offensive against Gaza, marking the third veto since the conflict began. Guterres warned that failure to act could lead to the council becoming \"incapable of doing anything,\" highlighting the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\n\n\n2024-02-22 Brazil Criticizes UN Inaction at G20 Meeting\n\nBrazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira criticised the UN Security Council's failure to address conflicts like those in Ukraine and Gaza during the opening of a G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro. Vieira underlined the need for international institutions to respond effectively to global challenges, highlighting the Security Council's paralysis. As the current G20 president, Brazil aims to use the platform to advocate for UN reform and address pressing issues such as conflict resolution and multilateral cooperation.\n\n\n\n2024-02-17 India Challenges Hegemony of P5\n\nOn February 17, 2024, Ruchira Kamboj, India's permanent ambassador to the United Nations, addressed the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council Reform in New York. She queried, \"So can we allow five permanent members to eternally override the collective voice of 188 member states? Let us not forget that this is the whole purpose of this reform, to right historical injustices and ensure inclusive decision-making through expansion, we feel in the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership, including reform in the working methods of the council, which also includes the question of the veto.\" Asserting the urgency to address the \"historical injustices\" faced by the global south, she emphasized that \"it is time to rectify these disparities by ensuring greater representation for regions like Asia, Latin America, and Africa on the UNSC through reform in both its...\".\n\n\n\n2024-01-21 Guterres urges G77 and China to drive momentum for global governance reform\n\nSpeaking at the third summit of the Group of 77 countries and China, in Kampala, on 21 January 2024, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said “Let us face it: those that benefit most from the present global governance system are unlikely to lead its reform. So, momentum for change must come from you. I urge you to keep driving these efforts forward.” More than 130 countries are members of the bloc – the largest grouping of the global South, representing 80 per cent of the world population.\n\nRead the full article here\n\n\n\n2023-12-01 Adoption of Presidential Note on Penholdership (S/2023/945)\n\nThe adoption of a note on penholdership within the UNSC marks a significant milestone in ongoing efforts toward UNSC reform. Initiated by the E-10, the note outlines guidelines for the designation of \"penholders,\" responsible for drafting and shepherding resolutions on specific agenda items. By emphasizing shared responsibility and meaningful participation of elected members, it promotes fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in the Council's decision-making process.\n\n\n\n2023-11-20 African Union Commission Chairperson H.E. Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat Speaks at C-10 Summit\n\nAt the C-10 Summit on UNSC Reforms, Chairperson Mahamat stressed the urgency of advancing the Common African Position.

Despite multiple meetings since October 7, the Council rejected four draft resolutions. Brazil, the US, and Russia submitted drafts, but permanent members Russia, China, and the US vetoed them. The General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution for a humanitarian truce, but the Security Council couldn't agree on any related text. Vieira emphasised the need for decisive action to end human suffering, highlighting the urgency of the situation on the ground in Israel and Gaza. This highlights the urgent need for reform within the Security Council to ensure it can effectively fulfil its mandate of maintaining international peace and security.\n\n\n\n2023-09-19 President Biden Addresses UN General Assembly\n\nPresident Biden delivered an address to the UN General Assembly in New York City, emphasising the importance of overcoming historical animosities to forge partnerships for peace and progress.

Dennis Sassou Nguesso, President of the Republic of Congo, inaugurated the 10th Foreign Minister’s meeting of the C-10. Emphasising Africa's common stance outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, Professor Francis advocated for two Permanent Seats and five Non-Permanent Seats for Africa in the United Nations Security Council and proposed either the abolition or extension of the Veto power to new permanent members. The meeting centred on analysing recent developments regarding UN Security Council Reform, including outcomes from the Intergovernmental Negotiations during the 76th UN General Assembly session, reflecting on progress within the negotiation process, and strategising on the C-10's role in promoting the Common African Position.\n\n\n\n2022-11-17 General Assembly Hears Renewed Appeals for Substantive Security Council Reform but Speakers Differ on Representation\n\nThe General Assembly convened its annual debate on Security Council reform, with speakers renewing calls for enlarging the 15-member body and updating its methods for transparency, inclusivity, and effectiveness in addressing global crises. Divergent views persisted in achieving reform, despite the appointment of co-chairs for intergovernmental negotiations. Some advocated for expanding both permanent and non-permanent membership, with specific attention to representation for small island states and Africa. Others proposed alternative models, such as Italy's suggestion for additional non-permanent seats. Permanent Council members like the United States and the United Kingdom supported varying degrees of expansion, while China cautioned against perpetuating dominance by developed nations. The debate showcased a spectrum of positions, with calls for substantive negotiations and a tangible commitment to reform.\n\n\n\n2022-04-12 Liechtenstein et al. on the UN Security Council veto\n\n38 Member States led by Liechtenstein and including the United States as a co-sponsor, tabled a resolution at the General Assembly that will automatically convene a meeting of the Assembly after a veto has been cast in the Security Council. The resolution, if adopted, will only apply during the remainder of the 76th session of the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n2022-04-05 Ukraine at the UNSC\n\nOn 5 April 2022 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine, at a meeting of the UN Security Council, said: ‘Remove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war from blocking decisions about its own aggression, its own war. And then do everything that can establish peace. Or show how you can reformat and really work for peace. Or if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether.’\n\n\n\n2022-03-03 Russia invades the Ukraine\n\nOn 24 February 2022 Russia invades Ukraine and, on 3 March 2022,Kemal Dervis and José Ocampo propose the possibility of overturning a permanent member’s veto. ‘This could be done by adding a clause to Article 27 that would allow a large double majority—representing, for example, at least two-thirds of member countries and two-thirds of the world’s population—to override a veto.’\n\n\n\n2021-11-16 Debate continues\n\nThe sterile debate on reform continues. 16 November 2021, during the 76th meeting of the General Assembly, delegates noted that there had been 29 years of structured consideration of reform and 12 years of intergovernmental negotiations, without any progress. Every year the various groups simply reiterate their well-known positions with the P5 secure in their veto.\n\n\n\n2018-09-27 The IBSA Dialogue Forum Ministers call for UNSC reform\n\n‘The Ministers underscored that no reform of the United Nations will be complete without the reform of the Security Council, including through the expansion of its membership in both permanent and non-permanent categories, in order to ensure adequate representation of developing countries. They affirmed that such a reform is critical for the Council to be able to adequately respond to global challenges. They expressed full support for each other’s candidatures for permanent seats in a reformed and enlarged UN Security Council. The Ministers welcomed the reform proposals of UN Secretary General and encouraged him to address the need for reform in other areas, including ensuring adequate geographical representation in the Secretariat, especially at higher levels, reviewing the funding and backstopping arrangements for special political missions, and strengthening the role of regional commissions.’\n\n\n\n2017-10-30 UNGA President appoints new Co-Chairs of the IGN\n\nUNGA President H.E.

This was followed, on 13 May 2015, by an updated version of the Framework Document following technical amendments as well as late submissions made by some Member States.\n\n\n\n2015-03-19 UNSC code of conduct\n\nMembers of the ACT (Accountability, Coherence, Transparency) Group circulate a non-paper on elements for consideration as part of a Code of Conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

Imbalance between the two categories of members could have negative effects on the Council’s efficiency.\n\nIn the case of an expanded Security Council, we support the accession to permanent membership of Germany, Brazil, India, Japan, and Africa. This also raises the question of including an Arab country among the permanent members of the Security Council.\n\nFrance and the UK support the option of an intermediate reform that would temporarily provide for seats with terms longer than two years and immediately renewable. At the end of this initial phase (that could last 15 to 20 years), a review conference should evaluate the impact of the reform and the necessity of completing the first phase of reform.\n\nFrance supports granting the G4 and Africa permanent membership and the British-French proposal of intermediate reform, which would last 15 to 20 years, that would provide seats with immediately renewable terms longer than two years. This also raises the question of including an Arab country among the permanent members of the Security Council.\n\n\n\n2009-01-12 Implementing the Responsibility to Protect\n\nBuilding on the 2005 World Summit Outcome document, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released his report, Implementing the Responsibility to Protect, A/63/677 which called for reform of the way the P5 wielded their veto power. Citing a global attitude shift since the massacres in Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica and elsewhere, Ban Ki-moon stated that the political costs had risen domestically and internationally for “anyone seen to be blocking an effective international response to an unfolding genocide or other high-visibility crime relating to the responsibility to protect.” The report describing the P5 veto power as a privilege of tenure and that the P5 had particular responsibility “to refrain from employing or threatening to employ the veto in situations of manifest failure to meet obligations relating to the responsibility to protect” in situations of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. It set out a three-pillar strategy for advancing the 2005 Summit Outcomes, consisting of the protection responsibilities of the State; international assistance and capacity-building; and timely and decisive response.\n\n\n\n\n\n2008-03-27 Supporting the G4 permanent seats\n\nIn a joint UK-France Summit Declaration, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown reaffirm their support for the candidacy of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan (the G4) for permanent membership, as well as for permanent representation for Africa on the Council. Given the deadlock in negotiations, they proposed intermediate reform of the UNSC that would temporarily provide for a new category of seats with terms longer than two years and immediately renewable. At the end of this initial phase (that could last 15 to 20 years), a review conference should evaluate the impact of the reform and to decide if these new types of seats should be termed into permanent ones.\n\n\n\n2007-09-10 Increasing UNSC membership?\n\nReport of the Open-Ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council Sixty-first Session of the UNGA, Supplement No 47 (A/61/47). The report of the facilitators is attached as Annex ll. With this report the UNGA creates an Intergovernmental Negotiation (IGN) framework in accordance with the following recommendation contained in paragraph 21:\n\n(d) Decides that the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Security Council should be considered during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly so that further concrete results may be achieved, including through intergovernmental negotiations, building on the progress achieved so far, particularly at the sixty-first session, as well as the positions of and proposals made by Member States;\n\n\n\n2007-07-19 Notions on the Way Forward\n\nUNSC adopts note authored by UNGA President\n\nThe product of months of work by the Council’s Informal Working Group on Documentation and Other Procedural Matters. In its section on “Notions on the Way Forward” the facilitators noted that maintaining the status quo is not acceptable to an overwhelming majority of Member States and proposed a transitional approach that included the creation of new non-permanent seats as well as four variations of an intermediate category.\n\nExtended seats that could be allocated for the full duration of the intermediary arrangement, including the possibility of recall.\n\nExtended seats, which would be for a longer period than the regular two- year term, but with the possibility of re-election.

If not in session at the time, the General Assembly may meet in emergency special session within twenty-four hours of the request therefor. Such emergency special session shall be called if requested by the Security Council on the vote of any seven members, or by a majority of the Members of the United Nations.”\n\nAn emergency special session is requested by a majority of UN Member States to the Secretary-General. Since the transfer of an issue from the Security Council to the General Assembly is considered a procedural matter it is therefore not subject to the P5 veto. The Uniting for Peace procedure has been used on ten occasions to facilitate UN action short of the use of force but its use has been rare in recent decades with the last use being in 1997. Other matters considered in separate sessions were the Suez Crisis, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the crisis in Lebanon, crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Middle East (Six-Day War), the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Israeli-Palestine conflict, South African occupation of Namibia (South-West Africa), the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights and Occupied East Jerusalem and Palestinian Territory. The latter session reconvened 18 times, most recently in 2009.\n\n\n\n1945-10-24 The UN is established\n\nFifty-one states ratify the Charter of the United Nations, formally establishing the United Nations. The UN Charter had been drafted during the two month-long United Nations Conference on International Organization based on the proposals from representatives of the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States of America (USA) at Dumbarton Oaks from August to October 1944. The Charter provides for a veto power to five countries in the hope that it would ensure their participation in the UN and its Security Council.\n\nThe UN Charter sets forth in Chapter V the composition and functions and powers of the UN Security Council (UNSC), in addition to its voting and procedures details.\n\nCOMPOSITION\n\nArticle 23\n\nThe Security Council shall consist of eleven Members of the United Nations. The Republic of China, France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America shall be permanent members of the Security Council. The General Assembly shall elect six other Members of the United Nations to be non-permanent members of the Security Council, due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of Members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of the Organization, and also to equitable geographical distribution.\n\nThe non-permanent members of the Security Council shall be elected for a term of two years. In the first election of the non-permanent members, however, three shall be chosen for a term of one year. A retiring member shall not be eligible for immediate re-election.\n\nEach member of the Security Council shall have one representative.\n\nFUNCTIONS and POWERS\n\nArticle 24\n\nIn order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations, its Members confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf.\n\nIn discharging these duties the Security Council shall act in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations. The specific powers granted to the Security Council for the discharge of these duties are laid down in Chapters VI, VII, VIII, and XII.\n\nThe Security Council shall submit annual and, when necessary, special reports to the General Assembly for its consideration.\n\nArticle 25\n\nThe Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the present Charter.\n\nArticle 26\n\nIn order to promote the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security with the least diversion for armaments of the world’s human and economic resources, the Security Council shall be responsible for formulating, with the assistance of the Military Staff Committee referred to in Article 47, plans to be submitted to the Members of the United Nations for the establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments.\n\nThe UN Charter in Chapter XVIII sets forth the rules for amending the Charter:\n\nA General Conference of the Members of the United Nations for the purpose of reviewing the present Charter may be held at a date and place to be fixed by a two-thirds vote of the members of the General Assembly and by a vote of any seven members of the Security Council. Each Member of the United Nations shall have one vote in the conference.\n\nAny alteration of the present Charter recommended by a two-thirds vote of the conference shall take effect when ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional processes by two-thirds of the Members of the United Nations including all the permanent members of the Security Council.\n\nIf such a conference has not been held before the tenth annual session of the General Assembly following the coming into force of the present Charter, the proposal to call such a conference shall be placed on the agenda of that session of the General Assembly, and the conference shall be held if so decided by a majority vote of the members of the General Assembly and by a vote of any seven members of the Security Council.”\n\nThe UNSC submits an annual report to the General Assembly under Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter and the Assembly considers the report in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 1. The Council’s report is included in the provisional agenda of the Assembly pursuant to rule 13 (b) of the rules of procedure.\n\n\n\nMore from the UNSC Reform Blog\n\nGoing nowhere slowly at the UN General Assembly’s annual debate\n\nAt this critical juncture in world affairs, the general debate should have featured more solutions and better leadership.\n\nAU plunges into turbulent G20\n\nThe African Union (AU) will likely be admitted as a permanent member of the G20 at the latter’s summit in New Delhi this weekend. To date, the AU has only attended summits of the G20 – the world’s foremost club for addressing global issues – as a guest. The G20\n\nBRICS+ and the tricky business of balancing global geopolitics\n\nWill an expanded BRICS precipitate a new international order, or collapse under the weight of its internal contradictions?\n\nBRICS+ and the future of the US dollar\n\nAlthough no single alternative to the dollar is likely, the shift away from a Western-led global order has begun.\n\nWhose tune will an expanded BRICS dance to?\n\nWill the inclusion of six new members in BRICS last week strengthen multipolarity or bipolarity?\n\nWhat Africa wants and what the West needs to do\n\nDemocracy generally follows development, so Africa’s friends should focus on unlocking rapid growth through better governance.\n\nHow the Ukraine war ends, and implications for Africa\n\nFour global scenarios capturing all reasonable outcomes show why rapprochement between the West and China is vital.\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine revives calls for Security Council expansion\n\nThe council was conceived in warfare – could that also bring reform, including adding a seat for Africa?\n\nAfrica has a rare chance to shape the international order\n\nAs global powers seek support for their competing worldviews, will Africa capitalise on its rising strategic value?\n\nZelensky’s adapt or die message should spur Security Council reform\n\nUnited Nations’ impotence over Ukraine makes the case for ending the power of five countries to determine global security."
