Liechtenstein has an Alpine climate, breathtaking scenery, a rich culture, and low taxes that attract expats. The living expenses can indeed be relatively high, but the wages there are among the highest in Europe.\n\nMoreover, due to its blossoming economy in recent years, Liechtenstein has become an increasingly attractive destination for people seeking to live there. As one of the most industrialized countries in the world, a strong financial center, and a leading high-tech innovation nation, the principality is considered one of the most innovative in the world.\n\nWho Can Move to Liechtenstein?\n\nAnyone wanting to make Liechtenstein their home can apply for a long-term visa. However, you need to keep in mind that residence permits are limited and therefore you might find it difficult to qualify for a long-term visa for the country.\n\nNote: EEA or Swiss citizens do not need a visa if they are staying for only 90 days.\n\nHow to Move to Liechtenstein?\n\nTo move to Liechtenstein, you are required to obtain a residence permit. Liechtenstein offers two residence permits: a residence permit for work purposes and a residence permit without work.\n\nThe residence permits are issued as follows:\n\nEEA citizens are issued 72 permits per year.

As a third-country citizen, a residence permit can be issued only if you are a manager, a specialist, or a qualified employee with a completed apprenticeship or long-standing professional experience.\n\nThe residence permit will allow you to work in Liechtenstein for over 12 months. After 12 months, you can extend your stay at the Immigration and Passport Office no later than 14 days after your permit expires. Finally, you can become a permanent resident after five consecutive years of residing in the country.\n\nNevertheless, due to the Principality’s restrictive residency policies, many employees must reside in neighboring areas and commute daily to work there.\n\nFurthermore, employees who work in the country but commute every day (cross-border commuters) are divided into three categories:\n\nSwiss citizens. Swiss citizens do not require a work permit or register with the police.\n\nEEA citizens. Citizens of the EEA who work in Liechtenstein must register with the authorities. Employers must register them with the Migration and Passport Office within ten days of hiring new EEA workers.\n\nCitizens of other countries.
