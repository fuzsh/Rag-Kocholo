        "text": "Statistical Cooperation\n\nStatistics play a fundamental role in planning, developing and monitoring the economic, social and environmental aspects of the European Single Market. The EFTA Statistical Office (ESO) is the liaison office between the EFTA National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) and Eurostat – the statistical office of the European Union. Cooperation between the EFTA NSIs, Eurostat and ESO, particularly in the context of the EEA Agreement, and technical cooperation with partner countries outside the European Statistical System remain the two main areas of ESO’s activities.\n\nMain tasks\n\nMaintaining and developing the EFTA Convention, which regulates economic relations between the four EFTA States;\n\nManaging the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement), which brings together the Member States of the European Union and three of the EFTA States – Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – in a single market, also referred to as the Internal Market;\n\nDeveloping EFTA’s worldwide network of free trade agreements.\n\nMission\n\nThe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is an intergovernmental organisation set up for the promotion of free trade and economic integration to the benefit of its four Member States – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – and of their trading partners across the globe.\n\nMember States\n\nThe four EFTA States are all open, competitive economies committed to the progressive liberalisation of trade in the multinational arena and in free trade agreements.\n\nAnnual Budget\n\nEFTA’s budget is prepared in two currencies: Swiss francs (CHF) and euros (EUR). Three of the four EFTA States contribute to cohesion in the European Union through a separate arrangement: the EEA and Norway Grants. EFTA’s budget is prepared according to the framework budgeting principle used by the Member States’ public administrations. This approach aims to increase awareness of budgetary spending at all levels."
