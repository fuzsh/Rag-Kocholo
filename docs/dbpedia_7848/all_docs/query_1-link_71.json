        "text": "Press Release\n\nNepal and Liechtenstein establish formal diplomatic relations\n\nAmbassador Durga Prasad Bhattarai, Permanent Representative of Nepal to the United Nations, and Ambassador Christian Wenaweser, Permanent Representative of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations met in New York today to mark the establishment of diplomatic relations between Nepal and Liechtenstein as of 24 November 2017, through the exchange of diplomatic notes.\n\nOn the occasion, they also signed a joint letter informing His Excellency António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations of this development.\n\nDuring the meeting held at the Permanent Mission of Nepal, the two Ambassadors shared their confidence that the direct diplomatic ties will help developing and further strengthening relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries in the framework of the United Nations and beyond.\n\nThe number of countries having diplomatic relations with Nepal has now reached 155 which comprises over 80 percent of the United Nations membership including all original signatories of the UN Charter. Liechtenstein marks the completion of Nepal’s diplomatic ties with all UN Member States from Europe.\n\nLiechtenstein is a small Western European and German-speaking constitutional monarchy, with Baduz as it capital. In spite of being double land-locked (bordered by Switzerland and Austria which themselves are land-locked), Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic product per person and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world. Liechtenstein maintains an active presence at the United Nations, including in pursuit of the rule of law in general as well as accountability, coherence and transparency in the work of the United Nations.\n\nNepal and Liechtenstein are working together closely in the United Nations on issues of common interest."
