        "text": "Liechtenstein, the world's 6th smallest state, is big when it comes to startups! Our Startup City Guide will walk you through Liechtenstein's startup community, funding opportunities & coworking spaces:\n\nSince Liechtenstein is the sixth smallest state in the world, it’s often underrated even though this country has developed into a business location in a class of its own within the last 60 years. This current standard can be attributed to excellent framework conditions and appealing growth perspectives. It’s no coincidence that more than 4000 enterprises are operating from here – among them several niche players who assert themselves in the world market successfully. A few famous examples to be named are Hilti AG, Thyssen Krupp Presta AG, as well as Hilcona AG or OC Oerlikon Balzers. Companies in Liechtenstein develop, produce and sell leading products and services to the world – enabled through frameworks such as a good access to well-educated specialists in the interior of the country as well as to the adjoining area of the lake of Constance.\n\nThe geographically centered location is of particular importance because it facilitates a direct market access to all states of the European Union and the European economic area as well as to the economic zone of Switzerland. Due to the customs treaty with Switzerland, Liechtenstein is part of the Swiss customs territory. Moreover, Liechtenstein uses the Swiss Franc (CHF). The access to all these important markets is ensured thanks to several international agreements. Companies and startups benefit from the free movement of goods, human capital, services and financial capital within the EU/EWR internal market. Apart from this, the principality of Liechtenstein is a member of the European free trade association and benefits from one of the biggest networks regarding free trade associations worldwide.\n\nNot least, the acknowledged stability and reliability of Liechtenstein as a Triple-A state contributes to the country’s status as a lucrative location for contemporary enterprises. An additional important part of the economy of Liechtenstein is the professional, stable and innovative finance center. Subsequent to the industry, financial services form the largest economic factor.\n\nGPS Direction: Liechtenstein\n\nAdvantages Of Building A Startup In Liechtenstein:\n\nEasy founding process – especially for FinTechs – supported by the government as well as by the Technopark (see below) who specializes in promoting FinTech ideas\n\nStrong networks involving companies and universities to facilitate research and development, prototyping and collaborations\n\nSupport, mentoring and financing of startups, enabled by institutions such as the Technopark, credit institutions as well as private and industrial investors\n\nCloseness to big and international cities but still away from the stress that comes with bigger cities\n\nCreative open workspaces with a unique atmosphere\n\nAn ideal testing market since Liechtenstein has the ability to adapt to the needs of startups\n\nA high level of political continuity and stability\n\nOne of the countries with the highest credit-worthiness in the world (Triple-A)\n\nSwiss Franc as the legal currency – one of the strongest currencies in the world\n\nSeveral state support opportunities for startups\n\nA unique legal form for foundations with an innovative character – The Liechtenstein Venture Cooperative (LVC)\n\nFinancial strengths of the public sector\n\nHigh frequency of investment capital in companies and banks as well as angel investors that merge within seed funds\n\nShort founding periods (approximately one week), promoted by the manageable size of the country; this provides flexibility and short decision paths\n\nManageable founding costs\n\nCloseness to leading business partners in the industrial sector\n\nTechnological know-how within the immediate environment\n\nTwo market accesses (EU/EFA) that enable to operate easily in Europe since it facilitates trade and provides shorts ways for the import and export of goods\n\nA simple tax system (flat tax) and a moderate business taxation\n\nLiberal economic policy and liberal company law\n\nStable legal-, economic- and social order\n\nA sound fiscal policy of the public budget\n\nThe University of Liechtenstein offers a Master of Science in Entrepreneurship – an ideal place to find motivated and inspiring team members and young talents\n\nLiechtenstein borders with Switzerland in the west and in the south while the borders in the east and in the north touch Austria. Even Germany is only less than one hour away. Already the geographical location contributes to Liechtenstein as a versatile and desirable place to live – considering economical as well as free-time aspects.\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein itself offers several highlights and attractions. No matter if you are looking for culture, culinary offerings, adventure or recreation – you will find it here. The breathtaking landscape provides various possibilities for free time activities. From hiking to biking, climbing or skiing – there is always something to do. Malbun is a well known and popular destination for winter vacationers while in the summertime, this alpine idyll, and the adjoining mountains, offer a whole range of outdoor activities including refreshing lakes for swimming. If you are into watersports you’ll benefit from the closeness to the lake of Constance which is accessible from Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. You can go sailing, motor boating, wind- or kitesurfing or simply swimming and sunbathing.\n\nWhat Founders Have To Consider:\n\nThe limited business areas that Liechtenstein specializes in, such as FinTech, communications and safety technology, packaging, environment, recycling, measurement and controlling technology or automation, meaning that if your startup idea does not correspond to these fields it might not be the place for you.\n\nRegarding the connectivity and the accessibility, it has to be mentioned that Liechtenstein itself has no airport. We recommend Zurich as the airport with the biggest amount of flight connections. It’s 115 km away, which takes about 60 minutes by car. Airports that are much closer are Altenrhein (50 km) and Friedrichshafen (85 km) but they offer fewer destinations.\n\nThe costs of living and housing are equal to the ones in Switzerland, which means that Liechtenstein is quite expensive. However, you can benefit from the proximity to Austria and Germany. There you profit from affordable housing and living costs. Commuting between work and home is quite common in this region. Depending on where you live, it will take you 15 to 45 minutes to get to work by car.\n\nIf the above-mentioned minor obstacles made you become doubtful, probably you should take one step back and consider the corporate path.
