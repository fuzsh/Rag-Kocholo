        "text": "An incalculable number of albums have been released in music history, but only 58 have earned the coveted distinction of Album Of The Year GRAMMY winner so far. From Henry Mancini's The Music From Peter Gunn to Taylor Swift's 1989, some of these elite albums have arguably surprised, some were seemingly consensus choices and still others have fostered lasting debate. In part four of Album Of The Year GRAMMY Winners, explore the albums that won — and were runners-up for — music's biggest prize for the 1990s.\n\n1990 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nBack On The Block\n\nQuincy Jones (And Various Artists)\n\nAlmost 40 years after launching his career as a young jazz trumpeter in Lionel Hampton's band, Quincy Jones utilized his wide range of skills as a performer, composer, arranger, and producer to create Back On The Block, an album with a spectrum of musical colors spaning jazz to rap, soul, world music, and pop. Varied contributors include Joe Zawinul, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Chaka Khan, Herbie Hancock, Ray Charles, Kool Moe Dee, Ice-T, Melle Mel, and pre-teen R&B star Tevin Campbell. Because of its eclecticism, the album brought home GRAMMYs in divergent categories including arrangement, rap and jazz, and Jones was named Producer Of The Year (Non-Classical) for the third time.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nMariah Carey, Mariah Carey\n\n… But Seriously, Phil Collins\n\nPlease Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em, M.C. Hammer\n\nWilson Phillips, Wilson Phillips\n\n1991 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nUnforgettable With Love\n\nNatalie Cole\n\nPrior to releasing Unforgettable With Love, Natalie Cole — named Best New Artist for 1975 at the 18th GRAMMY Awards — had kept a fair distance from her musical heritage, creating mostly pop- and R&B-based recordings. But she seemed to come to peace with her lineage on Unforgettable …, striking a beautiful balance of jazz and R&B standards, and taking advantage of technological recording advances allowing her to \"duet\" with her late father, jazz icon Nat \"King\" Cole. (The massive success of the album led her to move even further toward jazz on subsequent albums.) In addition to Album Of The Year, Unforgettable With Love's title track was dubbed both Record Of The Year and Song Of The Year (won by songwriter Irving Gordon).\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nHeart In Motion, Amy Grant\n\nLuck Of The Draw, Bonnie Raitt\n\nOut Of Time, R.E.M.\n\nThe Rhythm Of The Saints, Paul Simon\n\n1992 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nUnplugged\n\nEric Clapton\n\nIn a year of incredibly strong albums, including U2's heralded Achtung Baby and Annie Lennox's solo debut, an acoustic effort by a guitar legend was recognized as the year's standout. One of the more stellar albums of the MTV \"Unplugged\" series, Eric Clapton's 1992 effort (recorded in front of an intimate audience at Bray Studios in London) was a high point in his '90s output. The stripped-down yet genuine collection included a reworking of the classic \"Layla,\" traditional blues numbers \"Rollin' And Tumblin'\" and \"Before You Accuse Me,\" and \"Tears In Heaven,\" a touching farewell to his young son Conor, who had died the previous year. The track won both Song and Record Of The Year; in total, Unplugged garnered six GRAMMYs.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nIngenue, k.d. lang\n\nDiva, Annie Lennox\n\nAchtung Baby, U2\n\nBeauty And The Beast — Motion Picture Soundtrack, Various Artists\n\n1993 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nThe Bodyguard — Original Soundtrack Album\n\nWhitney Houston\n\nSeven years after her splashy self-titled debut, Whitney Houston took a detour from pop superstardom into acting with the film The Bodyguard. Although the romantic thriller failed to garner critical acclaim, the explosive popularity of the soundtrack resulted in an increase in box-office receipts. The album featured such standout Houston performances as \"I'm Every Woman,\" the soaring \"I Have Nothing\" and the monumental yet plaintive \"I Will Always Love You.\" Penned by Dolly Parton, it wasn't the first time the latter song was heard in a film: The same year \"I Will Always Love You\" appeared on Parton's album Jolene (1974), Martin Scorsese used it in his romantic drama Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. The Bodyguard would spend 20 weeks at No. 1 and sell more than 17 million copies, making it the biggest-selling soundtrack album in history.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nKamakiriad, Donald Fagen\n\nRiver Of Dreams, Billy Joel\n\nAutomatic For The People, R.E.M.\n\nTen Summoner's Tales, Sting\n\n1994 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nMTV Unplugged\n\nTony Bennett\n\nMore than 40 years into his career, 68-year-old Tony Bennett — one of the most enduring and respected pop standards interpreters — suddenly gained a whole new appreciative audience, many of whom were not even born when he'd won Record Of The Year for 1962 for \"I Left My Heart In San Francisco.\" Under the shrewd guidance of his son and manager Danny, MTV Unplugged became the apex of a refreshed phase of Bennett's career. Ably supported by his loyal and elegant Ralph Sharon Trio (and joined by guests Elvis Costello and k.d. lang) on MTV Unplugged, Bennett introduced a new generation to the Great American Songbook, once again proving that standards are hard to beat — in any era.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nThe 3 Tenors In Concert 1994, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, and Zubin Mehta\n\nFrom The Cradle, Eric Clapton\n\nLonging In Their Hearts, Bonnie Raitt\n\nSeal, Seal\n\n1995 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nJagged Little Pill\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\nAlanis Morissette was quite successful as a child actress and teen pop star years before she took the world by storm in the mid-'90s. And storm is no exaggeration: Jagged Little Pill, her moody, angst-filled debut for Maverick Records was embraced by pretty much anyone who needed a soundtrack to a relationship gone sour. Co-written and produced by Glen Ballard, the album — which has become one of the best-selling recordings by a woman ever — features a solid lineup of tracks, including \"You Oughta Know\" (a double GRAMMY winner), \"Ironic,\" \"You Learn,\" and \"Hand In My Pocket.\"\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nDaydream, Mariah Carey\n\nHistory Past, Present And Future Book I, Michael Jackson\n\nRelish, Joan Osborne\n\nVitalogy, Pearl Jam\n\n1996 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nFalling Into You\n\nCeline Dion\n\nCeline Dion won her first GRAMMY and became a household name in 1992 primarily through her duet with Peabo Bryson on the title track to the Disney animated film Beauty And The Beast. But the expansiveness of Falling Into You, featuring the gorgeous ballad \"Because You Loved Me,\" written by Diane Warren, foreshadowed the artistic level Dion would subsequently reach. Embellished with love-struck strings and shimmery touches of Latin American and dance-floor rhythms, the album perfectly captures the emotions and confidence of a then-recently married Dion. It also set her up perfectly to record the most recognizable song of her career: four-time GRAMMY winner \"My Heart Will Go On,\" from the 1997 film Titanic.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nOdelay, Beck\n\nThe Score, Fugees\n\nMellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness, the Smashing Pumpkins\n\nWaiting To Exhale — Motion Picture Soundtrack, Various Artists\n\n1997 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nTime Out Of Mind\n\nBob Dylan\n\nAfter a significant creative break from original recordings, Bob Dylan returned in 1997 with Time Out Of Mind, a rough-hewn collection of dark songs produced with the help of Daniel Lanois. Written during a long snowy winter in Minnesota and recorded in Miami's Criteria Studios, Time Out Of Mind's foreboding feel was heralded by critics as a return to form for Dylan. Said to be haunted by the influence of Buddy Holly during the sessions, he was further spooked by a serious chest infection that sidelined him during the final production of the album. Dylan would recover and, interestingly, share the media spotlight during this period with his son Jakob, whose band the Wallflowers were enjoying success with Bringing Down The Horse.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nThe Day, Babyface\n\nThis Fire, Paula Cole\n\nFlaming Pie, Paul McCartney\n\nOK Computer, Radiohead\n\n1998 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nThe Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill\n\nLauryn Hill\n\nAfter several rewarding years with the Fugees, Lauryn Hill branched out on her own with The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill, a soulful stew of hip-hop, reggae, R&B, and Motown. The album was propelled by the hit single \"Doo Wop (That Thing),\" which picked up GRAMMYs for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best Rhythm & Blues Song — in total, she brought home five GRAMMYs at the 41st GRAMMY Awards. Although named Best New Artist, Hill was certainly not new to the entertainment industry. Before her solo success, she'd dipped her toes into acting (\"As The World Turns\" and Sister Act 2) and was a member of the Fugees, two-time GRAMMY winners for 1996's The Score.\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nThe Globe Sessions, Sheryl Crow\n\nVersion 2.0, Garbage\n\nRay Of Light, Madonna\n\nCome On Over, Shania Twain\n\n1999 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nSupernatural\n\nSantana\n\nWith the help of then-Arista head Clive Davis, Carlos Santana reintroduced himself to the world in 1999 in a new light. Already a veteran dating back to San Francisco's Summer of Love, Supernatural found Santana paired up with an array of contemporary stars, including Matchbox Twenty's Rob Thomas (\"Smooth\"), Lauryn Hill and Cee Lo Green (\"Do You Like The Way\"), rock en español act Maná (\"Corizon Espinado\"), as well as fellow six-stringer Eric Clapton (\"The Calling\"), for an album that crossed both musical and generational divides. New fans of Santana reveled in their discovery, but tenured fans knew he'd been a master of unique collaborations for years (including work with Alice Coltrane, John McLaughlin and Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji, among many others). Supernatural was anointed with nine GRAMMYs, including Album, Record and Song Of The Year (the latter for writers Rob Thomas and Itaal Shur).\n\nOther Nominees:\n\nMillennium, Backstreet Boys\n\nFly, Dixie Chicks\n\nWhen I Look In Your Eyes, Diana Krall\n\nFanmail, TLC\n\nHere are six takeaway points from an evening marked by celebration and transcendent musical memories.\n\nDonna Summer’s “I Feel Love” Has Lost None Of Its Edge\n\nStudious music fans are well aware that “I Feel Love” — written by Donna Summer with visionary Italian producer Giorgio Moroder and British songwriter Pete Bellotte — is a shimmering disco gem, a futuristic precursor to the entire EDM genre. What was stunning about the Gala performance of the track by singer and actress Andra Day is how edgy and fresh the 1977 track still sounds today. Day’s ethereal reading was appropriately hypnotic, with live drums, nebulous synth textures and glorious, three-part vocal harmonies.\n\nThe Future Of American Music Is In Good Hands With The War and Treaty\n\nFormed by husband and wife Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter, The War and Treaty were rightfully nominated for Best New Artist at the 2024 GRAMMYs earlier this year. The duo’s electrifying combination of Americana, gospel, and rock is especially effective on a live stage, and the pair delivered a memorable rendition of Charley Pride's inducted Hall Of Fame country hit, “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin’,” recorded in 1971. The War and Treaty also received a standing ovation later in the evening for their performance of Ray Charles' classic, \"What'd I Say,\" released in 1959.\n\n26 Years Later, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill Is Still Ahead Of Its Time\n\nReleased in August 1998, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill sold more than 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and became the first hip-hop artist to win Album Of The Year at the 1999 GRAMMYs. At the Gala, Andra Day delighted the audience — including Lauryn Hill and her family — with a soulful version of hidden track “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You,” originally a Frankie Valli hit from 1967. Day's performance was marked by brassy accents and funky bass lines, creating an unapologetically lush rendition that mirrored the sonic richness of Hill's original take.\n\nRead more: Revisiting 'The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill': Why The Multiple GRAMMY-Winning Record Is Still Everything 25 Years Later\n\nAtlantic Records Transformed The Face Of Global Culture\n\nCelebrating 75 years of inaugural label honoree Atlantic Records in the span of a few minutes loomed like an impossible task, but the Gala producers paid tribute to the legacy label well. Beginning with a short video, the event segment highlighted the miraculous roster assembled by Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson that included Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Led Zeppelin, ABBA, Phil Collins, and Bruno Mars — to name just a few. But it was the actual performances that highlighted the label’s hold on pop culture: Ravyn Lenae’s breathy take on Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly With His Song” made a case for considering the 1973 hit as one of the most vulnerable recordings of all time. On the other side of the dynamic spectrum, the epic rendition of Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” by alt-rock quartet Shinedown was appropriately intense.\n\nThe Wondrous Legacy Of Stax Records Should Not Be Underestimated\n\nThe home of such legendary artists as Otis Redding, The Staple Singers and Carla Thomas, Memphis-based Stax Records developed a rich, ragged sound with gospel, blues, R&B and luminous pop as its foundational pillars. Currently the subject of an HBO documentary series, \"Stax: Soulsville USA,\" the record label defined American music during the ‘60s and ‘70s. Memphis singer/songwriter William Bell was one of its most prolific artists, and he regaled guests with a performance of his Hall of Fame inducted debut 1961 single, “You Don’t Miss Your Water.” At 84 years of age — and the winner of a Best Americana Album at the 2017 GRAMMYs — Bell was in rare form, and the band backed him up seamlessly, reproducing the sinuous organ lines of the original.\n\nRead more: 1968: A Year Of Change For The World, Memphis & Stax Records\n\nFuture Editions Of The Gala Will Continue To Surprise And Delight\n\nThe inaugural GRAMMY Hall of Fame Gala set a high standard for future celebrations of iconic recordings.
