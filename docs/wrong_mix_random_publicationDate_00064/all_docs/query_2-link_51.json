        "text": "LITR1-CE 9001 An Afternoon with Thoreau: What Walden Means Today (0 Credits)\n\nThe 2016 bicentennial of the birth of Henry David Thoreau has been the occasion of a wide-ranging reassessment of Thoreau as an essayist and journal-keeper, a naturalist, and a prophetic moral voice. At the center of all the attention remains Thoreau&rsquo;s experiment in living a life of simplicity and quiet reflection in a cabin beside a wooded pond, recorded in his now classic 1854 publication <em>Walden; or, Life in the Woods.</em> By reading selections from <em>Walden</em> and other writings from his broad range of work, we will examine Thoreau&rsquo;s reflections in the context of his own mid-19th-century America and contemplate his relevance for our 21st-century culture and current environmentalist thinking.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9002 Classical Mythology (0 Credits)\n\n<p>This class introduces the myths of Ancient Greece and Rome, examining the ways that myths were taken up, reimagined, and repurposed in Greek and Latin literature. Each of our five sessions will cover a different classical author- Homer, Sappho, Lucretius, Vergil, and Ovid- from whom we&rsquo;ll read small selections in translation. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with some of the core mythic traditions in the Greco-Roman world as well as the ways that myths were understood, adapted, and challenged over time. We will consider some of the different definitions of classical myth, the relationship between myth and religion in antiquity, critiques of traditional mythology levied by philosophers and other sceptics, and the ways in which myths were often co-opted for political and ideological purposes. This course is appropriate for those who are new to classical mythology as well as those with some prior knowledge of the classical world.&nbsp;</p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9003 The Generations of Jewish American Fiction (0 Credits)\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">This course surveys Jewish American fiction from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present, surveying the initial immigrant experience, the splendors and sorrows and assimilation, and the redefinition and self-questioning of writers from generations X and Y (Millennials).

Each class will be devoted to a different medium: TV, music, books, visual art, and internet culture. How do the forms of ancient mythology make it suitable for meme culture? How do pop representations of famous mythical and historical characters (Hercules, Zeus, Cleopatra, and others) square with their ancient receptions? How does engaging with pop culture from a mythical perspective help us be more mindful of diversity and political ideology? We will ask these and other questions through various readings in translation and analyses of contemporary pop culture, including <em>Star Wars</em>, Taylor Swift, <em>Station Eleven</em> (both the book and the TV show), among others.<strong>&nbsp;Fall 2022 tuition is $399.</strong></p><br><br><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9005 African-American Crime Fiction (0 Credits)\n\n<p>At once a form of entertainment and serious social exploration, part of popular culture and the literary field, African-American crime fiction interrogates injustices in policing, imprisonment, and social inequality while showcasing the crime novel as a quintessential modern fictional form.&nbsp; The characteristics of the genre as one that engages issues of labor, class, gender, and sexuality with an urbane flair and often sly humor set it apart. The ability of authors writing within the genre to trace the antecedents, processes, and consequences surrounding crime, exploitation, and oppression make the African-American crime novel more relevant than ever. Readings include: Chester Himes, <i>If He Hollers Let Him Go</i>; Iceberg Slim, <i>Night Train to Sugar Hill</i>; Donald Goines, <i>Whoreson; </i>Ernest Gaines,<i> A Lesson Before Dying</i>; Tayari Jones, <i>An American Marriage; </i>Attica Locke<i>, Bluebird, Bluebird.</i></p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9006 Literature and Medicine: Reading and Writing About Illness and Healing (0 Credits)\n\n<p>Illness, recovery, and healing are universal human experiences and, therefore, often prevalent themes in great literature.

The course covers Susan Sontag&rsquo;s classic work&nbsp;<em>Illness as Metaphor,</em>&nbsp;contemporary essays by Oliver Sacks, short fiction by Joan Leegant, and poetry by Jo Shapcott, as well as works by other writers and poets.

This course examines the choice between art and life faced by creative individuals. We read Kafka&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Metamorphosis&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Judgment,&rdquo; in which the protagonist experiences high anxiety regarding solitude versus marriage; Somerset Maugham&rsquo;s <em>The Moon and Sixpence,</em> based on Paul Gauguin, who abandoned his family to pursue painting; Alain-Fournier&rsquo;s haunting novel, <em>The Lost Estate (Le Grand Meaulnes),</em> which poses the question: who is more creative, the staid narrator who has written this self-reflective novel or his wild and adventurous main character who lives life as if it were a work of art; Goethe&rsquo;s autobiographical bestseller, <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther,</em> about an artist too sensitive to thrive in the real world; and brief excerpts from Thomas Mann&rsquo;s <em>Werther</em>-inspired <em>Lotte in Weimar.</em> Handouts feature observations on creativity by Beethoven, van Gogh, Woolf, Baudelaire, Rilke, Kazantzakis, and others.</p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9008 Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (0 Credits)\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#222222\">Seen as an artistic failure or an overgrown children&rsquo;s book until the 1920s, Herman Melville&rsquo;s <i>Moby-Dick</i> is now widely accepted as the greatest single work of American literature with indelible scenes, characters, and storylines. This course will provide an intensive focus on the book, examining its characters and themes closely while also considering the cultural background of Melville&rsquo;s America, divided by issues of race and expansion and facing a deepening political rift that would lead to civil war. Melville was that rare writer who was both supremely talented and laden with knowledge of a highly technical subject, in this case whaling and voyaging. This makes for a book like no other.</span></p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9009 Women of the Mystery: From Agatha Christie to J. K. Rowling (0 Credits)\n\nThe mystery is one of the most popular genres in English literature, consistently occupying at least a quarter of any bestseller list. Interestingly, women authors have dominated the form since its inception. Why is this? And furthermore, why are the detectives usually male? This course explores the origins of detective fiction and the prominent role that women writers have played in enhancing its literary reputation. We will read books by award-winning authors that are highly regarded for their excellent writing and great storytelling&mdash;otherwise known as page-turners. Authors include Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Josephine Tey, P. D. James, Elizabeth George, Tana French, Donna Leon, and J. K. Rowling (aka Robert Galbraith).\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9010 Murder, Mayhem, Mystery: The Usual Suspects with Unusual Stories (0 Credits)\n\nMurder, mayhem, and mystery seem to have a stranglehold on the weekly <i>New York Times</i> list of bestselling novels. In this course, explore what makes mystery the lynchpin of modern fiction, and examine why readers are perennially enthralled by the perverse and the deadly. Selections span a broad international range, from the founders of the genre in the 19th century (Agatha Christie) to the 21st century (Paula Hawkins). Focus will be on how the genre has changed in style and subject matter over the years while retaining its readership. Readings include Agatha Christie, <em>The ABC Murders;</em> Georges Simenon, <em>A Crime in Holland;</em> Iain Pears, <em>The Last Judgement;</em> Henning Mankell, <em>Firewall;</em> Ruth Rendell, <em>Not in the Flesh;</em> Robert Galbraith (aka J.

Comparing Headley&rsquo;s translation to earlier versions by Seamus Heaney and J.R.R. Tolkien, we will examine Beowulf&rsquo;s heroic quest to slay the evil monster Grendel; the roles of gender and power in the presentation of Grendel&rsquo;s mother; the importance of loyalty, courage, and honor in a dark and dangerous world; and Beowulf&rsquo;s final struggle against a giant dragon and the metaphysical threats he represents.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9012 Discovering the Modern: The Novels of E.M.

M. Forster wrote six novels that chronicle the development of a modern sensibility in English and global society. Examining issues of class and gender, sexuality and colonialism, cohesion and alienation, Forster&rsquo;s novels are funny, incongruous, and revelatory. They also display an author determined to keep the novel a sustainable, renewable form in the twentieth century. We will read, in order, Forster&rsquo;s six novels: Where Angels Fear To Tread, The Longest Journey, A Room With A View, Howards End, Passage to India, and the posthumously published Maurice, his compelling novel of same-sex love. We will also read Frank Kermode&rsquo;s short critical book, Concerning E. M.

The collection of essays draws upon Abbey&rsquo;s three years as a park ranger in the labyrinthine deserts of southeastern Utah. Writing in a manner that is at once rude and sensitive, angry and loving, Abbey projects the voice of a latter-day prophet, not only crying <em>out</em> in the wilderness, but crying out <em>for</em> the wilderness. Abbey&rsquo;s desert experiences provide what Thoreau once so poignantly called for: &ldquo;Contact! Contact!&rdquo;&mdash;direct encounters with earth and rock, sky and water. Abbey&rsquo;s radical work helped to inspire the Earth First! advocacy movement. But today, the environmental crises that animated his protest have escalated beyond anything he might have envisioned in his day: global warming, shale oil fracking, mountain-top removal mining. What can the late Abbey say to us now? What can he do for us now?\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9014 American Literature 1865 to 1920: Five Major Authors (0 Credits)\n\n<p>The years between the end of the Civil War and the end of the First World War saw the emergence of American fiction to world status. Focusing on five major authors of the period. Henry James (<em>Portrait Of A Lady</em>, two sessions), Mark Twain (<em>Tom Sawyer</em> and <em>Pudd&rsquo;nhead Wilson</em>), Charles Chesnutt (<em>The House Behind the Cedars</em> and <em>The Marrow of Tradition</em>), Edith Wharton (<em>The House of Mirth</em> and <em>Summer</em>), and Willa Cather (<em>O Pioneers</em> and <em>My Antonia</em>), We will see how the gender, racial, and regional diversity of American rakers accommodated a different modes of symbolism, local color, realism, and naturalism to paint a vivid picture of an emerging American modernity. Students should read Portrait of a Lady for the first session. Questions? Contact us at The Center for Applied Liberal Arts (CALA).

Today, readers may perceive the novel as commentary on a cholera epidemic, the coal conditions in the midlands of England, the perilous interconnections of community, or the aspirations of women in a still-patriarchal society.&nbsp;<i>Middlemarch</i>&nbsp;is a novel about how ambitions&mdash;Dorothea Brooke&rsquo;s for a life of achievement, Tertius Lydgate&rsquo;s for scientific renown, Edward Casaubon&rsquo;s for intellectual mastery&mdash;are doomed to defeat and compromise. At the same time, it is also a book that enlarges our sense of possibility and the ways that fiction can offer a meaningful understanding of other people&rsquo;s lives, something of which we are still in need of today. We will read the first two books of<i>&nbsp;Middlemarch,</i>&nbsp;&ldquo;Miss Broke&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old And Young,&rdquo; for the first class.</p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9016 Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek Revisited (0 Credits)\n\nA year after it was published in 1974, Annie Dillard&rsquo;s <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em> won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction and subsequently was listed on Modern Library&rsquo;s 100 Best Nonfiction Books. Dillard wrote <em>Pilgrim</em> after completing a master&rsquo;s thesis on Thoreau&rsquo;s <em>Walden,</em> and it is so much in the spirit of that American classic that writer Ed Abbey has called her Thoreau&rsquo;s &ldquo;true heir.&rdquo; Although Dillard has said that she does not regard herself as a &ldquo;nature writer,&rdquo; she does uniquely combine fascinating nature observations with overarching philosophical and religious questions in a vibrant and highly charged first-person style. In this course, we will read and discuss Dillard&rsquo;s <em>Pilgrim,</em> as well as a few short selections from her other writings. Our discussions will probe the themes and issues that pervade Dillard&rsquo;s work and consider her place in the contemporary American literary landscape.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9017 The Wilderness World of John Muir (0 Credits)\n\nThe epitome of the free-spirited naturalist, John Muir (1838&ndash;1914) famously tramped through wilderness areas from California and the Southwest to Alaska on foot and without gun or sleeping bag, in a complete immersion in North America&rsquo;s natural world. For John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, going to the mountains was &ldquo;going home.&rdquo; Muir&rsquo;s deep appreciation for nature led him to his greatest legacy&mdash;preservation. During a three-day camping trip with Teddy Roosevelt, he convinced the president of the need for a national program of conservation, which led to the expansion and strengthening of the national park system. This class will begin with an overview of Muir&rsquo;s life and work, including slides and film clips, and then turn to discussion of selected writings by Muir. In our examination of Muir&rsquo;s life and legacy, we also will consider his distinctive voice of his writing&mdash;the exulting voice of America&rsquo;s premiere naturalist, to whom each day was always &ldquo;the morning of creation.&rdquo;\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9018 The Eighteenth-Century Novel: Britain and France (0 Credits)\n\n<p>The 18th century saw the rise of the novel in its modern form. Through studying major authors and texts from the period in both Britain and France, we will see the various shapes the novel took, from the epistolary mode comprised of fictional letters to the omniscient narrator who framed a whole swath of action in a knowing voice, from realism to fantasy to utopia, and from observant satire to inward-looking psychology. Readings include: Samuel Richardson, <em>Pamela</em> (two sessions), Henry Fielding, <em>Tom Jones</em> (two sessions), Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost, Manon Lescaut, Jonathan Swift, <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, Fran&ccedil;oise de Graffigny, <em>Letters from a Peruvian Woman</em>, Voltaire, Candide, Sarah Scott, Millennium Hall, Choderlos de Laclos, <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em>.

Both utterly realistic and profoundly oneiric, the mean streets and nightmare alleys of these novels, along with their world-weary heroes and femme fatales, have evolved into literary and cultural symbols with archetypal resonance. We will explore classic American noir novels as expressions of social and political protest and commentary, as well as aesthetically satisfying and dramatic renderings of an entire psychology&mdash;or even as a manifestation of a singular existential philosophy. Readings include two major precursors of noir and six modern noir classics: <em>The Murders in the Rue Morgue,</em> Edgar Allan Poe; <em>The Turn of the Screw,</em> Henry James; <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice,</em> James M.

Don John, <i>Ado</i>&rsquo;s evil mastermind, handily turns mirth to mayhem when he concocts an illusion making a virtuous bride-to-be look like a strumpet. Richard III is arguably Shakespeare&rsquo;s most charismatic villain, reveling nonstop in his homicidal, hypocritical journey to absolute power. His world, however, is strikingly modern, one in which rhetoric is used to dupe and corrupt and people can be led to believe almost anything. Indeed, we are left with the suspicion that perhaps all politics is about appearance rather than reality and that Richard is a Machiavellian, even Hitlerian, prototype&mdash;a prototype of which we have not seen the last.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9028 Summer Intensive: Modern British Drama in London (0 Credits)\n\n<p>Now in its 16th season, this program is a thrilling experience for anyone who loves theater.

This neighborhood, home to many European immigrants, has produced a significant number of literary works, all of which help us gain insight into the life and realities of those who settled there. We will see the way in which the neighborhood itself becomes a kind of constant background character in this particular literary tradition, as well as analyze the reason for such great literary production in an area marked by poverty and hardship. In addition, we will examine the way in which the LES has come to symbolize a mythical launching pad for success in the New World, and how early hardships are perceived as a rite of passage in an idealized manner, as well as how various groups have sought (and continue to seek) to reconnect with the LES for the &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; life experience it has come to represent.</p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9038 Reading James Joyce's <i>Dubliners</i> (0 Credits)\n\nReview in detail the first work of fiction penned by the 20th century's most influential writer.

This course draws from popular obsessions, such as the documentary series <em>Making a Murderer</em> and the podcast <em>Serial;</em> classic novels like Camus&rsquo;s <em>The Stranger</em> and Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s <em>Crime and Punishment;</em> and provocative modern tales such as Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s <em>Alias Grace</em> and Michelle McNamara&rsquo;s investigation of the Golden State Killer <em>I&rsquo;ll Be Gone in the Dark.</em> We will discuss the blurred line between art and advocacy, narrative&rsquo;s love of doubt, the reasoning of the criminal mind, killer novelists, and the gravitational pull of the whodunit.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9081 Robert Frost: A Poet Who Took \"The Road Not Taken\" (0 Credits)\n\nRobert Frost is one of America&rsquo;s most endearing and enduring literary icons. He is best remembered for his poems devoted to his rural New England landscape (&ldquo;Birches&rdquo;) and for his recitation at John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s 1960 inauguration (&ldquo;The Gift Outright&rdquo;). But beneath this veneer of simplicity, there was a much more complex and enigmatic persona. Contradictory in nature, he was a solitary man at heart but reveled in public adulation. This course will delve into the deeper layers of meaning of his poems, explore the complexities of his personal life, and discover how they are interwoven. His frequent use of metaphor&mdash;saying one thing and meaning another&mdash;is key to the closer examination of his complete works. Beside all the accolades (including honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge) and awards (including four Pulitzer Prizes), his love of nature, and his down-home plainness, there lay beneath a troubled man dealing all his life with adversity, family tragedies, and depression. His wide literary influences (including Emerson, Hardy, and Dickinson) were many, but his voice was unique in the pantheon of American poetry.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9082 The Irish Short Story: Oscar Wilde to Edna O'Brien (0 Credits)\n\nThe Irish have a well-known heritage of great storytelling, and this centuries-old oral tradition has translated beautifully into a rich and unrivaled history of literary prose. What other country can boast of four Nobel Prizes in Literature (Yeats, Shaw, Beckett, Heaney), as well as the writer who revolutionized the novel&mdash;James Joyce? This course will focus on the short story&mdash;a true test of masterful writing skills. The stories reflect in a concise way the close connections between family, politics, and religion in the face of historical and cultural change. Readings may include classics of Irish literature by authors such as Oscar Wilde and James Joyce, as well as contemporary writers such as Anne Enright, Edna O&rsquo;Brien, John Banville, William Trevor, and Colum McCann&mdash;all masters of the short story.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9095 Novels with a Social Conscience (0 Credits)\n\nExamine how eight important novelists offer moving, memorable stories that illuminate the injustices evident in cultures and communities.

Deploying his smart and soothing signature style that can accommodate romance, realism, a sense of great fun, and an epic vision, Trollope addresses the crisis of the time: modernization, which though necessary and inevitable, could threaten the stability of &ldquo;Deep England.&rdquo; This issue is explored within the rich context of life itself, with loves and losses, misfortunes and victories, griefs and laughter. This series features many of Trollope&rsquo;s most memorable heroines, including the potent Mrs. Proudie, the bright and bitter Signora Neroni, the redoubtable Lady Lufton, and the controversial romantic heroine Lily Dale, as well as such memorable persons as the beleaguered Josiah Crawley, the ambitious Archdeacon Grantly, the scheming Obadiah Slope, and the good-hearted <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/trollope/harding1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rev. Septimus Harding</a>. Whether hero or villain, high or low, all of Trollope&rsquo;s characters struggle with the ways of the world and are considered with regard to this series&rsquo; paramount lesson: &ldquo;Till we can become divine, we must be content to be human, lest in our hurry for a change we sink to something lower.&rdquo; Readings (in order): <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warden\" target=\"_blank\">The Warden</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barchester_Towers\" target=\"_blank\">Barchester Towers</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Thorne\" target=\"_blank\">Doctor Thorne</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framley_Parsonage\" target=\"_blank\">Framley Parsonage</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Small_House_at_Allington\" target=\"_blank\">The Small House at Allington</a>,</em> and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Chronicle_of_Barset\" target=\"_blank\">The Last Chronicle of Barset</a>.</em> <strong>Note:</strong> Students should read <i>The Warden</i> for the first class.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9102 Memoirs from Around the World: Inside the Heart and Soul of Another (0 Credits)\n\nThere&rsquo;s no more exciting or fearsome plot than the course of an unexpected life. These glorious memoirs transport us to different times and places. Through the author&rsquo;s eyes, you will observe twists of fate, sun-kissed joys, upheavals, raucous family life, wartime nights, and life-altering decisions. We will explore stories about Paris in the 1920s; a lively, educated family under Mussolini; an impish kid in apartheid South Africa; a boy and his mother chased across America; a manly Welsh adventurer changing his sex; a humorist on family holidays; and a black comedy set in a wartime Dutch attic.

Ford Madox Ford&rsquo;s <i>Parade&rsquo;s End</i> tetralogy is unequaled in its portrayal of the convulsive effects of that war on modern civilization. When an exemplary British infantry officer, Christopher Tietjens, finds that his wife Sylvia is having an affair, his convictions and world view change in dramatic and unexpected ways. The world of England&rsquo;s stately homes begins to teeter, as does Christopher&rsquo;s life. The calculating wife, the idealistic feminist Valentine Wannop who is his new love, the bureaucratic opportunist Macmaster, and the classic cad Major Perowne each add rich dimensions to this exploration of the emerging modern times that will carry Tietjens along with them. We will examine the way in which Christopher&rsquo;s tangled relationships speak to that era&rsquo;s transformations, and the way Ford&rsquo;s own innovative style is itself inflected by the changes it depicts.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9104 Bob Dylan: American Literature's Defiant Prophet (0 Credits)\n\nThe unexpected winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature, the poetic songwriter Bob Dylan speaks to the heart of the American vernacular, to our deep spiritual yearnings, and to the continuing search for racial and social justice. At once bardic and deeply allusive, calling on generations-old folk traditions but also resonant with dramatic change, Dylan&rsquo;s work asks for serious exploration. In this course, we will do just that: examine Dylan&rsquo;s lyrics, watch videos, and read some of the most insightful scholars of Dylan&rsquo;s oeuvre. Topics to be covered include whether Dylan embodies this spirit of, as he describes in &ldquo;The Times They Are A-Changin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the &ldquo;writers and critics / who prophesize&rdquo; and how his Nobel win changes our sense of literature as a category. We also will discuss his work in depth, including protest songs, such as &ldquo;Blowin&rsquo; in the Wind&rdquo; and &ldquo;Masters of War&rdquo;; surreal dreamscapes, such as &ldquo;Desolation Row&rdquo;; love songs like &ldquo;Lay Lady Lay&rdquo;; love-hate songs, such as &ldquo;Shelter from the Storm&rdquo;; the proto-rap of &ldquo;Subterranean Homesick Blues&rdquo;; existential meditations, such as &ldquo;Jokerman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not Dark Yet&rdquo;; and&mdash;of course&mdash;key songs featuring tambourine men, rolling stones, idiot winds, and sad-eyed ladies of the lowland.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9105 Reading Dante's Inferno (0 Credits)\n\n<p><strong>Register for this Summer 2023 course on the new <a href=\"https://nyusps.gatherlearning.com/events/reading-dantes-inferno\">NYU SPS Academy of Lifelong Learning website</a>.</strong></p><br><br><br><br><p>Join us for a journey through Hell&mdash;Dante&rsquo;s <i>Inferno&mdash;</i>a world in which a fascinating cast of characters, condemned to eternal punishment for sins committed on earth, recount their stories to the poet as he makes his pilgrimage through the underworld. In this first canticle of the <em>Divine Comedy,</em> readers encounter condemned lovers, corrupt popes and politicians, thieves, pagans, and a variety of sinners. Using a reader-friendly translation, we will examine <em>Inferno&rsquo;s</em> key themes, overall message, and place in cultural and literary history.&nbsp;<strong>Summer 2023 tuition is $629.</strong></p><br><br><br><br><p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9106 Shakespeare: The Sonnets (0 Credits)\n\nShakespeare&rsquo;s love sonnets belong to a tradition deriving from Francesco Petrarch, whose love poetry swept Europe and initiated the vogue of the sonnet sequence in celebration of the chaste, exalted, unattainable mistress. In Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets, however, this traditional object of devotion is displaced by what was then considered to be two scandalously unorthodox love interests: the bulk of the poems are addressed to a femininely beautiful young man, and the remainder to a rampantly promiscuous woman. Unsurprisingly, these sonnets have spawned a host of vexing questions. Are the poems autobiographical, as is widely believed&mdash;a possibility that continues to provoke revulsion and denial? If so, who was the lady (hundreds of pages have been devoted to pondering her identity), and who was the man? Or are they both poetic constructs through which to explore heterodox love?\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9107 Sites of Seduction: Death in Venice and Its Ancient Greek Models (0 Credits)\n\nAutobiographical, sensual, and shocking&mdash;Thomas Mann&rsquo;s novella, <em>Death in Venice,</em> is a masterpiece of modernist fiction. On the surface, <em>Death in Venice</em> is the story of a world-renowned German author who&mdash;plagued by frustration, boredom, and writer&rsquo;s block&mdash;succumbs to a forbidden love during a sojourn in Venice. When read with the ancient Greek literature that served as Mann&rsquo;s inspiration, however, the novella becomes a conversation across expanses of literary time. In this course, begin by reading two works that profoundly influenced Mann: Euripides&rsquo;s tragedy, <em>The Bacchae,</em> and excerpts from Plato&rsquo;s <em>Phaedrus,</em> before diving into <em>Death in Venice.</em>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9112 Dictatorship and Its Discontents Through the Lens of Latin American Literature (0 Credits)\n\nThrough most of the 19th and well into the 20th century, Latin America was home to dictators and strong men, frequently emerging from the army, who exerted complete control over their nations for long periods of time. In turn, such authoritarian regimes often were contested by dissident voices and even revolutionary movements. A variety of Latin American writers have given their personal versions of &ldquo;dictatorship and its discontents,&rdquo; either by directly examining specific rulers or more indirectly exploring the effects and consequences of their actions. This course focuses on the Latin American experience, but these texts provide a framework that can be profitably used to examine similar regimes in other parts of the world, regardless of time and location. Texts include Juan Rulfo&rsquo;s <em>Pedro P&aacute;ramo,</em> Miguel &Aacute;ngel Asturias&rsquo;s <em>The President,</em> Mario Vargas Llosa&rsquo;s <em>The Feast of the Goat,</em> Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez&rsquo;s <em>The Autumn of the Patriarch,</em> and Marta Traba&rsquo;s <em>Mothers and Shadows.</em>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9113 Shakespeare: King Lear and Twelfth Night (0 Credits)\n\nExplore two of Shakespeare&rsquo;s best-loved plays and the cultural forces that helped to shape them: <em>Twelfth Night,</em> his wickedly witty version of the Renaissance LGBT scene, in which shipwrecked twins, each thinking the other dead, embark on a series of romantic misadventures involving cross-dressing, dashing counts, obese alcoholics, and a perceptive fool who presides over the whole madcap affair; and <em>King Lear,</em> Shakespeare&rsquo;s searing portrayal of redemption through suffering, which is widely considered his greatest tragedy.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9114 The Great Ones: Artists from the Kennedy Center Honors (0 Credits)\n\nThese artists from theatre, film, dance, comedy, and classical and popular music, all Kennedy Center Honorees, have thrilled and astonished audiences over the last 45 years.

Experience the soaring cello of Yo-Yo Ma; the groundbreaking dance of Mikhail Baryshnikov and Alvin Ailey; the changing faces of screen heroes, including Bette Davis, Meryl Streep, Gregory Peck, and Robert De Niro; the music of songwriters who peer into the human heart, such as Stephen Sondheim, Johnny Cash, and Pete Seeger; and the glory of comic genius from the likes of Carol Burnett and Mel Brooks.

Following the footsteps of four Nobel Prize winners, George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Samuel Beckett, and Seamus Heaney, this course will take the reins of these literary icons and explore Irish literature up to the present day. By examining great storytellers who transformed a celebrated oral tradition into a rich and lyrical prose style, we will focus on how contemporary Irish writers continue to distinguish themselves and their illustrious past. These stories weave a complex literary tapestry, complete with rebellious, controversial, cultural, political, and religious ramifications. Readings may include works by Maeve Brennan, Roddy Doyle, Mary Lavin, Colum McCann, William Trevor, and Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9116 The Best and Worst of Times: Charles Dickens's Historical Novels (0 Credits)\n\nCharles Dickens produced two major historical novels that explore social issues persisting to our day. In <em>Barnaby Rudge,</em> Dickens depicts a right-wing populist rebellion in 1780 that highlights familiar and unexpected ethnic tensions within British national space, while also examining the impact of the English defeat in the American Revolution. In <em>A Tale of Two Cities,</em> Dickens castigates the malevolence of the French monarchy and the overreached of the revolutionaries who overthrew it, all the while affirming that individuals can still make a difference within history. We will spend two weeks each on these major and still-provocative works.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9117 1985: Literature Goes Global (0 Credits)\n\n1985 was a pivotal year in world literature&mdash;in many ways it could be described as the year literature went global. The impacts of the Reagan administration and of global free-market ideology began to be felt; magic realism, feminism, and postmodernism were entering the mainstream; the legacies of earlier traumas, such as World War II and the Vietnam War, were being reassessed; and once-marginalized regions in Eastern Europe and Latin America began to speak back to the world. This course will explore literature from the US, Canada, Colombia, Indonesia, the UK, and Australia that was written during this explosive and important year. Readings may include Margaret Atwood, <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale;</em> Don DeLillo, <em>White Noise;</em> Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, <em>Love in the Time of Cholera;</em> Tahar Ben Jelloun, <em>The Sand Child;</em> Jeanette Winterson, <em>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit;</em> Pramoedya Ananta Toer, <em>Footsteps;</em> Anne Tyler, <em>The Accidental Tourist;</em> Bobbie Ann Mason, <em>In Country;</em> and Peter Carey, <em>Illywhacker.</em>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9118 The New York City Novel: From Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence to Imbolo Mbue's Behold the Dream (0 Credits)\n\nThis course will consider five novels set in different eras in New York City.

Picaresque novels are often described as &ldquo;road novels,&rdquo; since they chronicle the episodic life of a p&iacute;caro, a rogue or rascal, who is always on the move. Resourceful and unscrupulous, the p&iacute;caro also is astutely observant of society&rsquo;s flaws, contradictions, and corruption. If a p&iacute;cara, a woman, she is not averse to using her body for survival and profit. Picaresque narratives offer eventful action and the lessons of experience, a close-up view of an individual&rsquo;s soul, and a panoramic view of the surrounding social landscape. Readings include <em>Two Spanish Picaresque Novels: Lazarillo de Tormes and The Swindler,</em> Cervantes&rsquo; &ldquo;Rinconete and Cortadillo,&rdquo; von Grimmelshausen&rsquo;s <i>The Life of Courage,</i> Voltaire&rsquo;s <i>Candide,</i> Twain&rsquo;s <i>Huckleberry Finn,</i> Mann&rsquo;s <i>Confessions of Felix Krull,</i> Kerouac&rsquo;s <i>On the Road,</i> and Allende&rsquo;s <i>Eva Luna.</i>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9124 Dancing to the Music of Time: The Novels of Anthony Powell (0 Credits)\n\nAnthony Powell has been called the &ldquo;English Proust&rdquo; and &ldquo;the greatest comic novelist since Dickens.&rdquo; As the glowing reviews of Hilary Spurling&rsquo;s recent biography of the author have noted, Powell is gaining recognition as one of the great British novelists of the past century, with a style <em>The New York Times</em> characterized as full of &ldquo;irony, wit, and resonance.&rdquo; We will read selected volumes of Powell&rsquo;s masterpiece, the 12-novel sequence <em>A Dance to the Music of Time.</em> With both lyrical depth and uproariously funny humor, Powell chronicles a generation of giddy-heads, bohemians, soldiers, cads, and dreamers who contend with all the changes that swept over the 20th century, especially the crisis of the Second World War. With an epic range as well as an intimate sensibility, this series will introduce us to many characters through the decades, foremost of which are the sensitive, meditative Jenkins, and the astonishing, legendary, and loathsome Widmerpool, one of the 20th century&rsquo;s great villains.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9130 John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga: Men and Women in the Edwardian Age (0 Credits)\n\nJohn Galsworthy&rsquo;s <em>Forsyte Saga</em> was significantly responsible for his Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932, awarded for what the Swedish Academy termed his &ldquo;distinguished art of narration.&rdquo; But in addition to experimenting with nearly every modern technique, Galsworthy also represented an Edwardian era that only now is beginning to enjoy deserved appreciation. In telling the story of the bourgeois Forsytes and their slow exposure to the modern world, the author depicts a gallery of fascinating Edwardian characters, from the cruel to the compassionate, the stiff-upper-lip to the contemplative and questioning. The role of women and their emergence into full citizenship are a major theme, counterpointing the despicable Soames Forsyte, the &ldquo;man of property&rdquo; who is the epitome of malevolent, patriarchal self-centeredness, while at the same time the novel&rsquo;s irresistible center. In this course, we will read the entire saga, comprising three books, <em>The Man of Property, In Chancery,</em> and <em>To Let,</em> and two short interludes.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9132 Three Recent Nobel Laureates from France; Le Clezio, Modiano, Ernaux (0 Credits)\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:8.0pt\"><strong>Register for this Summer 2023 course on the new <a href=\"https://nyusps.gatherlearning.com/events/three-recent-nobel-laureates-from-france-le-clezio-modiano-ernaux\">NYU SPS Academy of Lifelong Learning website</a>.</strong></p><br><br><br><br><p style=\"margin-bottom:8.0pt\">&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br><p style=\"margin-bottom:8.0pt\">In the twenty-first century so far, three writers from France have been awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.

Dostoyevsky was of several minds about many things, and his novels masterfully display this ambivalence as they explore the conventions of love, greed, and revolution. But they also reveal the novelist&rsquo;s unparalleled grasp of psychological subtlety and expertly capture his characters&rsquo; feelings of fear, guilt, joy, and salvation. Reading the recent, acclaimed translations by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, we will see how novels immersed in the context of one hundred and fifty years ago are still resonant in the vital present.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br><p><strong>Fall 2023 tuition is $499.</strong></p><br><br><br><br><p><em><strong>Registering at least three weeks prior to the course start date is highly recommended.</strong></em></p>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9169 James Joyce's Ulysses (0 Credits)\n\n<p><br><br><style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--><br><br></style><br><br>Register for this Spring 2024 course on the new <a href=\"https://nyusps.gatherlearning.com/events/james-joyces-ulysses-spring-2024---online\"><strong>NYU SPS Academy of Lifelong Learning website</strong></a>.</p><br><br><br><br><p>Considered the greatest canonical work modernity has produced, James Joyce&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Ulysses&nbsp;</em>not only is a modern&nbsp;<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>but a superb portrait of a provincial yet also cosmopolitan city of Dublin at a crucial time in its history. This extraordinary novel is a gallery of literary styles; vivid, memorable characters; and warm if sometimes subtle humor. In its triad of the aesthetic, reflective Stephen; Leopold Bloom, the robust everyman; and Molly, his sensuous, creative wife, Joyce created&nbsp; three of the most compelling fictional representations of the twentieth century.

Just as he has decided on one life course, he discovers his Jewish identity and becomes captivated by the implications that this suggests. Daniel&rsquo;s story is paralleled by that of Gwendolen Harleth, who makes a disastrous marriage with a sadistic older man and has to deal with its consequences. In these two contrasting stories of young people searching for meaning, love, and purpose, we see a great novelist at the peak of her powers\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9256 Reading Dante's Paradise (0 Credits)\n\nJoin us for the final leg of our favorite pilgrim&rsquo;s trip through the afterlife&rsquo;s three realms.

We will discuss his two masterpieces of realist fiction that led to his reputation as creating not simply works of art, but &ldquo;pieces of life,&rdquo; and which led Isaak Babel to comment that, if the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.&nbsp; His two greatest novels will&nbsp; feature one of literature&rsquo;s most passionate and tragic romances, families unhappy each in their own way, peasants, aristocrats, generals, the drawing rooms of St Petersburg, the killing fields of Borodino, everyday people and Napoleon himself, and will explore philosophical issues such as chance, fate, freedom, coincidence, predestination, and spiritual transformation. We will also read his third and final novel that explores Tolstoy as he was best known in his time&mdash;as a sage and social thinker who inspired such leaders as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King as well as today&rsquo;s champions of human rights.

Instead, they explore pessimism and inner tragedy. The son of Irish immigrants, O&rsquo;Neill inherited these genes from his ancestors and their long tradition of lyrical storytelling. Explore O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s personal life, his contemporaries in American theater, and the influence that his Irish heritage had on his reception and legacy as an international icon.

Read classics of the genre such as Raymond Chandler&#8217;s <i>The Big Sleep</i> and James M. Cain&#8217;s <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>, as well as contemporary best sellers like Chuck Palahniuk&#8217;s <i>Fight Club</i>, and explore its most famous tropes&#8212;dames and thugs, femme fatales and corrupt police&#8212;and overwrought morals.

By the end of the course, understand Shakespeare&#8217;s language in both its literary and cultural contexts and have the resources to enjoy Shakespeare on your own.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9403 Modernism and Race (0 Credits)\n\nThis course will consider the ways in which high modernism, which appeared in the interwar period, was shaped by the Victorian and Edwardian obsession over &ldquo;racial hygiene,&rdquo; as articulated by biologists, anthropologists, and philologists promoting degeneration theory, eugenics, and scientific racism. In this course, we will read modernist works alongside critical texts to examine both the embrace and rejection of racial theories in modernist literature. Readings will include T. S. Eliot&rsquo;s <i>The Waste Land</i> and his unfinished &ldquo;blackface&rdquo; play <i>Effie the Waif;</i> sections from Ezra Pound&rsquo;s <i>The Pisan Cantos </i>and <i>Guide to Kulchur;</i> excerpts from James Joyce&rsquo;s novels and his essays on the Irish race; Djuna Barnes&rsquo;s <em>Nightwood;</em> Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s <i>To the Lighthouse;</i> and Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s <i>Endgame,</i> alongside the anti-racist and anti-colonial texts that he translated for Nancy Cunard&rsquo;s <em>Negro: An Anthology.</em>\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9404 Shakespeare's Histories: Richard II, Henry IV Part 1, and Henry V (0 Credits)\n\nExplore this epic cycle of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays&mdash;<em>Richard II, Henry IV Part 1,</em> and <em>Henry V</em>&mdash;and the cultural forces that helped to shape them. Together they trace the turbulence that roils the British kingdom under three successive rulers: Richard II, whose disastrous rule and cavalier perversion of justice plunge his realm into faction and revolt; Henry IV, Richard&rsquo;s murderer, whose ruthlessness and efficiency cannot save him from the mounting troubles that curse his reign and dog him to his grave; and Henry V, Henry&rsquo;s wayward son. These plays trace the influence of these kings on England&rsquo;s history and ponder issues still very relevant today: the ethics of invading a sovereign nation, the effects of illicitly gained power, and the loneliness of political rulership.\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9414 Introduction to the Hebrew Bible: Poetry to Apocalypse (0 Credits)\n\nContaining the sacred writings of two of the major world religions, the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) has influenced centuries of literature, art, and thought.

Examine sexual relationships&#8212;sensual, sordid, and sublime&#8212;in the Bible and in the ancient world, including the roots of gender roles, power, forbidden sexuality, and consequences for deviation.

Is <em>Merchant</em> anti-Semitic, as is widely alleged? This interpretation has been exploited by anti-Semites throughout the play&rsquo;s history, including the Nazis who used <em>Merchant&rsquo;s</em> propaganda potential to buttress their anti-Jewish agenda. Or is it, as others argue, a plea for tolerance? Does <em>Shrew</em> really champion violence to tame an unruly wife? Or does it advocate female supremacy through pretended wifely submission?\n\nGrading: SPS Non-Credit Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nLITR1-CE 9602 Walk on the Wild Side: Music, Poetry, and Theatre of the 1970s (0 Credits)\n\nNew York City in the 1970s has been enshrined in the collective memory as a decade of upheaval, tumult, and urban decay; however, it also was a time of tremendous creativity.
