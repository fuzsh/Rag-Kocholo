        "text": "Board of Directors\n\nJoe Conway\n\nJoe Conway was born in Concord, Massachusetts where his passion for literature took root at an early age. An avid reader, his first job was working as a tour guide at the Old Manse—one-time home to both Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne. He earned a BA in English from Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and began a 10+ year career as a freelance writer in San Francisco. While living the Bay Area, he began volunteering at 826 Valencia as a writing tutor and member of the editorial board. After moving to Portland, Maine in 2008, he was thrilled to find The Telling Room and began volunteering as an after school writing coach. In subsequent years he’s been a Young Writers and Leaders writing mentor eight times over, and he served on The Telling Room staff as the organization's first ever dedicated grant writer. He has seen first-hand how even a brief experience at The Telling Room can change a young person's life. Joe lives in South Portland with his wife Jenny and their two young boys and runs his own digital marketing, advertising, and analytics firm, Sonar Digital LLC, located in Portland.\n\nSara Crisp\n\nSara Crisp is an artist who has shown in Maine and New York for years. She paints and makes sculptural books and has mentored students throughout the years. She lives with her husband and two dogs in Cumberland but grew up in Southern New Hampshire. Sara got her masters in Education and taught reading and writing in the Lower School at the Waynflete School in Portland. She has been involved for years with the Siddhartha School Partnership, which supports a small school in Ladakh in northern India. In addition to supporting the school, Sara and her husband have sponsored three students beyond just their Siddhartha School education.

Reporting to Unum’s chief communications officer, Sean directs a team of strategists focused on company-wide communications planning and implementation. Throughout his career, Sean has served as a political appointee, C-suite leader, and more than a decade as a global PR agency executive. Before joining Unum Group, Sean was vice president for communications & public affairs at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, where he led the integrated marketing, communications, and public affairs strategy for one of the nation’s top liberal arts colleges.

Beyond the office, he volunteers on the non-profit boards of the Great Schools Partnership and Androscoggin Bank’s MainStreet Foundation, mentors young professionals, and provides strategic counsel for local economic development initiatives.\n\nTanuja Desai Hidier\n\nAfter a Bombay babyhood and childhood in Massachusetts, Boston-born author/singer-songwriter and Board President Tanuja Desai Hidier moved to NYC and later to London, where the tale of her debut novel’s protagonist, Dimple Lala, grew clear. Born Confused, Tanuja’s pioneering debut, considered to be the first South Asian American YA novel, was named an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults. Sequel Bombay Blues received the South Asia Book Award, and Tanuja has made two booktrack albums of original songs based on the novels. She also produced the Deep Blue She #Mutiny2Unity #MeToo WeMix music video/PSA: an award-winning intersectionality project featuring one hundred plus artist/activists, mostly women of color (and many writers).\n\nTanuja was recently featured on the New York Film Academy’s 20/20 series. Her prose-poem was included in PEN America’s India At 75 anthology, a historic collection by authors from India/its diaspora reflecting on India’s 75th year of Independence. Other recent nonfiction has appeared in Parents Magazine, Maine Women Magazine, and Amjambo Africa; she also wrote the foreword to Untold: Defining Moments of the Uprooted, a nonfiction anthology featuring more than thirty new Brown womxn writers. Tanuja’s ode to Pippi was included in Scholastic’s 100 Reasons to Love Reading anthology in celebration of their 100-year anniversary. In 2021 Tanuja was a Good Morning America Inspiration List headliner for ABC’s network-wide project for Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month 2021.\n\nTanuja now lives in Maine, on Wabanaki land, in a three-generation story-telling-and-loving home, aged from octogenarian grandparents with true lived tales from apartheid Africa and Gandhi-era India, and two teen daughters, one of whom has written her favorite fantasy novel, and the other, her favorite YA novel.\n\nTanuja believes stories help both reader and writer thrive. By showing us we’re not alone, stories change, honor, create—and save lives. And youth voices are not only worth hearing for the sheer pleasure of it, for the hope they gift: We need to listen. Our youth are both our future story and our now. Our windows, mirrors—and portal. They inherit our world, and bring to it their priceless, vital own. She is thrilled to be on team Telling Room, who understands and embraces all this: is committed to supporting young people on their journeys towards learning to trust and treasure and share their own voices. Knowing their stories matters…and that someone is listening.\n\nLibby Lauze\n\nLibby Lauze is an education management professional with over 18 years of experience in the field of international education.
