Born in Boston, Massachusetts, she showed a predilection for music from an early age and started singing in the church choir. Her career took a significant leap forward when she moved to Germany to perform in several musical productions, and it was during this time she adopted the stage name, Donna Summer. Summer's breakthrough arrived with the release of the single \"Love to Love You Baby\" in 1975, a song that was not only a commercial success but also set the tone for her career as a disco diva. Her unique style of music, often dubbed as 'erotic disco', made her a household name. The late 1970s saw her dominating the charts with hits like \"I Feel Love\", \"Last Dance\", and \"Hot Stuff\". Her album Bad Girls, released in 1979, showcased her versatility by blending elements from different genres like rock, soul, and funk with her signature disco style. Despite her fame in the disco scene, Summer never confined herself to a single genre. In the 1980s, she ventured into pop music, creating hits like \"She Works Hard for the Money\" and \"This Time I Know It's for Real\". Throughout her career, Summer was recognized with multiple accolades, including five Grammy Awards. She continued making music until her untimely death in 2012, leaving behind a legacy that influenced a new generation of musicians. Her contributions to music and the impact she had on the disco era ensured her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nBirthplace : Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nDonna Jean Miller, better known as Donna Mills (born December 11, 1940), is an American actress and producer.
