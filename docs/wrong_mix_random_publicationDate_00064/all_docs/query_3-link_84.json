Disco is in da house, or will be on Thursday when Donna Summer -- the Queen of Disco -- is inducted.\n\nA five-time Grammy winner, Summer is being inducted into the Hall posthumously; though she never smoked, the singer born LaDonna Adrian Gaines in Boston on New Year's Eve 1948 died 11 months ago of lung cancer. She reportedly believed she contracted the disease after inhaling toxic particles released by the attack on the Twin Towers in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nHer fellow inductee in the Rock Hall Class of 2013, Ahmet Ertegun Award winner Quincy Jones, was the first to take to Twitter to mourn her passing on May 17, 2012:\n\n\"Rest in peace dear Donna Summer. Your voice was the heartbeat and soundtrack of a decade.\"\n\nSummer's family declined to speak to the media about her induction. Brian Edwards, who was her assistant from 1989 to 1995, and was her client relations representative for the last seven years of her life, spoke on behalf of the family.\n\nBut the family -- husband singer-songwriter and producer Bruce Sudano; their two daughters, Brooklyn and Amanda; and daughter Mimi from her first marriage -- did post a note on her website, donnasummer.com:\n\n\"We are overjoyed the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has recognized Donna's tremendous musical achievements. It's an honor we know she quietly hoped for and would very much cherish. We are deeply grateful.\"\n\nSome purists have bristled at the inclusion of a disco artist in the Rock Hall, a criticism that irked Edwards.\n\nFYI\n\nThe Class of 2013 will be inducted in the Cleveland-based Hall of Fame.\n\nRush\n\nHeart\n\nRandy Newman\n\nPublic Enemy\n\nDonna Summer\n\nAlbert King\n\nLou Adler\n\nQuincy Jones\n\n10 p.m. EST Thursday, April 18, at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles\n\nRock fans can visit\n\nfor live coverage starting at 9 p.m. and continuing throughout the event. The coverage will include tweets from Pop Music Critic Emmet Smith from inside the ceremony in Los Angeles, a live chat, photo galleries, video, stories and more. And edited version of the show will be broadcast 9 p.m. Saturday, May 18 on HBO.\n\nLook for daily profiles of the inductees through Thursday.\n\nAlbert King.\n\np> \"Donna was more than just 'the Queen of Disco,' \" Edwards wrote in an email. \"Yes, her introduction to stardom was a result of her major successes in the field of disco at the time. However, her career encompassed so many different musical genres, including R&B, gospel, pop, jazz and pure rock and roll.\"\n\nAnd Edwards wasn't done defending the artist who won the very first Grammy for rock vocal performance by a female for 1979's \"Hot Stuff.\"\n\n\"No disrespect to Madonna, but given the majority of her hit records are pop/dance-oriented, no one said anything when she was inducted [into the Rock Hall],\" Edwards wrote. \"And she has NEVER even been nominated for a Grammy in the rock [vocal] category, yet she shares the same distinction as Summer as a recipient of a Grammy in the best dance recording category.\"\n\nThat particular category was introduced in 1997, and the first winner was . . . Donna Summer.\n\n\"The facts speak for themselves,\" the ever-loyal Edwards wrote. \"In my opinion, Donna Summer is more of a true rock artist than Madonna will ever be.\"\n\nEdwards is right about Summer's diverse musical background. Like many artists, she began singing in church as a child -- her first solo performance was at the age of 10, when she filled in for a soloist who failed to show.\n\nSummer left home just before graduating from high school and moved to New York City to front a psychedelic rock group called Crow. But when that band failed to land a record deal, she auditioned for \"Hair,\" which had to be a shock to her devoutly religious family. Melba Moore won the part, but Summer was offered the role in the Munich, Germany, production of the show.\n\nIt would prove a fortuitous move. Summer lived in Europe for several years in various locations, She eventually married an Austrian actor named Helmuth Sommer. That marriage didn't last, but the name did, after a fashion, when she Anglicized it to Summer.\n\nAlso in Germany, Summer met producer Giorgio Moroder, who really was the impetus for her success in what then the burgeoning disco genre. She was singing backup for a Three Dog Night recording being produced by Moroder when they met.\n\nTogether with fellow producer Pete Bellotte, they literally created the Donna Summer sound that has landed her in the Rock Hall. Attempts to reach Moroder and Bellotte for this story were unsuccessful.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Moroder played a significant role in what would become Summer's breakout disco hit, \"Love to Love You Baby.\" The moans and groans on the tune come from Summer herself and, according to her Wikipedia biography, were \"induced\" by Moroder while they sat together on a couch in a darkened room.\n\nThere are two versions of the song -- one a shorter, radio-friendly cut -- and one specifically made for use in discotheques: It runs almost 17 minutes long.\n\nSummer's first No. 1 in the United States was a remake of Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park,\" and her first live album, \"Live and More,\" released in 1978, became her first to top Billboard's Top 200 chart. In all, she had three double albums attain that lofty perch: \"Live and More,\" \"Bad Girls\" (1979) and \"On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II\" (1987). Her record sales -- albums and singles -- reportedly top 130 million worldwide.\n\nSummer's last single to chart, \"To Paris With Love,\" hit No. 1 on Billboard's dance chart in 2010, and she reportedly was working on an album of standards while battling the cancer that claimed her life.\n\nChristina Aguilera and Jennifer Hudson are scheduled to perform some of Summer's music at Thursday's induction ceremony.\n\nPresuming, of course, that Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre, the site of the ceremonies, has a mirror ball stashed somewhere."
