Ballots on the name change were due May 10, but the strong tide favoring the changeover was obvious from the very first returns, and further reflected the overwhelming sentiment expressed for a change of some sort in a National Executive Board vote taken earlier this year.

It also established a 10-member National Executive Committee, which will act for the NBD in implementing Association policies. The NEC formation was somewhat controversial.

Author Lennis Knighton returns AGA investment.\n\nSilver Anniversary history is published, “From Birth to Maturity: The First Twenty-Five Years of the Federal Government Accountants Association.”\n\nOctober 1976\n\nAGA makes headway in its steady, uphill effort to eliminate discrimination against government accountants who are pursuing the CPA certificate. Recent action in two states, plus the favorable discussion climate between AGA, the AICPA and NASBA have contributed to AGA’s positive outlook. Allen Reynolds, chairman of the AGA subcommittee on relations with the AICPA, summarizes AGA’s position as follows:\n\nnot to seek blanket acceptance of government experience, but to seek removal of impediments which result in blanket rejection.\n\nto overcome practices which subject the government auditor to stricter judgments on experience than apply to his colleagues in public accounting.\n\nAGA takes strong position on federal pay. As in the past, the Association has taken no issue with specific rates or percentages recommended. Rather, the comments have centered on perceived flaws in the system which appear to have worked against the financial management careerist. AGA “deplores” the continuing freeze on upper-level salary increases, and expressed the Association’s continuing concern over the resulting detrimental effect on retaining top-level professionals in government. AGA’s Employment Referral Service is expected to expand significantly in scope with the upcoming mailing of a special brochure describing the service to potential users.\n\nNovember 1976\n\nAGA sets goal of 10,000 members with start of MORE campaign (Membership Offers Relevant Education). New incentives for members who sponsor the most new members and chapters that show the highest percentage membership increase.|\n\n26th Annual National Symposium scheduled for June 27–29, 1977 at the Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington, D.C.\n\nDecember 1976\n\nTo support the activities of the new National Research Board, the NEC instructs the director of education to devote some of his time to research initiatives.\n\nTreasury Department releases a prototype report, “United States Government Consolidated Financial Statements.”\n\nJanuary 1977\n\nMORE program is on target. Had 8,715 members when the program began on July 1, 1976 and now have 560 new members. However, even with the new members, the membership number at press time was 8,190 since many members had not yet paid their dues. MORE acronym expanded to say: Membership Obligations Rest on Everyone.\n\nAGA issues research project “Review Guide for Federal Grantees’ Financial Management Systems.”\n\nFebruary 1977\n\nNEC relinquishes all rights to the ill-fated textbook when it receives $14,000 check from author Lennis Knighton, who pledges to pursue the project on his own.\n\nMembership number now at 8,409.\n\nAGA seminars on Zero Base Budgeting are in hot demand. Fourteen chapters have indicated an interest in hosting the ZBB seminars and 11 dates are confirmed.\n\nArthur Schoenhaut, executive secretary of the Cost Accounting Standards Board, has been nominated president-elect. He is a member of the Montgomery/PG County Chapter.\n\nNational Chapter Activities Committee has undertaken a number of projects including standardizing the chapter competition program and offering assistance to weaker chapters.\n\nLegislation was introduced to create Inspectors General in many federal agencies. These positions of unprecedented power are executive level, presidential appointees. Tom Morris was appointed to the first inspector general position created at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\n\nMarch 1977\n\nSchoenhaut named President-Elect for FY 1979.\n\nGovernment accountants who have often criticized the CPA examination because it does not test competence in the government financial process, finally have a chance to do something about it. Through a project of AGA’s National Subcommittee on Relations with AICPA, AGA members are being invited to submit questions in the government accounting/auditing area for possible inclusion in the Uniform CPA Examination.\n\nWashington, D.C. Chapter’s offering of Zero Base Budgeting seminar attracts 1,400, believed to be the largest audience ever for an AGA event.\n\nApril 1977\n\nJune 30 will mark the fifth anniversary of the AGA/OMBE program.\n\nMarch membership number hovers around 8,800, which exceeds last June’s high mark of 8,715, but there is still much to be done to meet the 10,000 member goal by June 30.\n\nMay 1977\n\nExecutive Vice President Nathan Cutler testifies before the House Subcommittee on Employee Ethics and Utilization, chaired by Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder of Colorado. Cutler was commenting on a bill to establish a Commission on Ethics and Financial Disclosure for federal employees. AGA was invited to offer comment because in the words of Schroeder “representing whom they do represent—and considering that accountants are privy to a great deal of the policy-making in government—they (AGA members) may be especially hard hit by the disclosures that HR 3829 would require.” Cutler emphasized AGA’s commitment to the highest ethical standards for government employees and noted that AGA supports “reasonable financial disclosure designed to prevent conflict of interest and to enhance the government employees’ image and public confidence in their work.”\n\nPresident Scantlebury announces the imminent resignations from the National Office staff of Nathan Cutler, executive vice president, and Dr. Arthur Smith, first director of education. Cutler plans to move to Florida and Smith will head up a private consulting firm. Scantlebury forms a selection committee to replace Cutler.\n\nThe Civil Service Commission has lent both general and specific support to AGA’s National Symposium, as well as other activities of professional associations that relate to an employee’s job. The CSC said in a letter to President Scantlebury that it “recognizes that symposia of the Association of Government Accountants provide worthwhile training for government employees engaged in financial management activities…we readily endorse the Association’s 26th annual symposium…the nature of your programs at this symposium will help meet the training needs of federal employees and can be attended under the Government Employees Training Act.”\n\nPast National President Harry Levine proposes research project to improve the quality of financial management in hospitals. The Philadelphia Chapter has agreed to sponsor the research.\n\n2,700 AGA members to receive questionnaire asking their views on the standards promulgated by the Cost Accounting Standards Board.\n\nJune 1977\n\nSecretary of the Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal is made an honorary AGA member.\n\nSymposium program now stretches nearly an entire week, from Sunday to Wednesday, with ZBB sessions planned for Thursday and Friday. Congressman Jack Brooks from Texas to be the keynote speaker. Senator Edmund Muskie, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, will deliver the keynote address at the two-day ZBB seminar.\n\nPercentage of women in the accounting profession was recently calculated at 22 percent while the percentage in government is only 8.8 percent. Our membership records do not identify the number of women in AGA. However, a sample survey of three large chapters identified 190 women, roughly 8 percent of the total in those chapters. In FY 1977, we have six women serving as chapter presidents (9 percent) and women occupy approximately 8 percent of the national committee positions. At our last symposium, 9 percent of those attending were women. So it appears that the percentage of women accountants participating in AGA is roughly equal to the percentage of women accountants in government.\n\nThey refer to this quote from Bahai: \"The world of humanity has two wings: one is women and the other is men. Not until both wings are equal can the bird fly.\"\n\nAugust 1977\n\n26th Annual Symposium attracts more than 1,000 attendees and offers seven major addresses and five plenary sessions as well as 45 different workshops—the most extensive array of options ever offered. On to June 26–28, 1978 in San Francisco. Golden Gate in ‘ 78!\n\nGerald Murphy accepts the gavel from Donald Scantlebury.\n\nNational Education Board issue survey to determine continuing professional education needs of members.\n\nAnnual NBD meeting described as “low-key.” Observers felt that the brevity and relative blandness of the meeting was attributable to the advent, under a reorganization two years ago, of the National Executive Committee. NBD approved the fiscal year 1978 budget with $552,000 in projected revenues and $544,000 in projected expenses.\n\nJune Brown becomes the first woman appointed to the NEC.\n\nNathan Cutler steps down as executive vice president, stating “AGA and its predecessor, FGAA, have been a vital part of my life since the day I joined the Association twenty-four years ago. I cannot begin to tell you what AGA’s camaraderie, confidence and encouragement have meant to me over the years.” Dr. Mortimer Dittenhofer, a former government careerist and professor at American University, has been named the new executive vice president.\n\nSeptember 1977\n\nProgram year gets under way with President Murphy pledging expansion of the education program (with Larry Olewine acting as education director on a part-time basis) and asks members to remember that the G in AGA’s name stands for all levels of government, and urges the Association to support its growing state and local base of members. He also backs a long-range planning effort. Dittenhofer’s top priority is an education program that serves all the members’ needs.\n\nMembers of AGA’s Committee on Cooperation with Other Organizations met with the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay to present the Association’s views on the proposed pay raises for federal employees.\n\nPast President Levine’s research project into the finances of hospitals moves forward with the support of the Philadelphia Chapter. In addition, Lloyd Hara, a Seattle Chapter member and auditor of King County, WA has initiated a research project to determine the extent and characteristics of auditing in the nation’s counties.\n\nOctober 1977\n\nNEC considers the question of whether non-government-employed AGA members can hold national and chapter officer positions, particularly president’s posts. The National Bylaws Committee will develop a “white paper” on the pros and cons of this issue and will seek member opinions.\n\nNovember 1977\n\nAssociation adds two new chapters in state capitals—Trenton, NJ and Albany, NY. Trenton Chapter had 48 members in the charter group and Jim Dolan is the first president. The Albany petitioning group had 54 members and will be known as the New York Capital Chapter.\n\nAGA explores the possibility of establishing a research foundation to study major accounting problems inherent in government operations and has prepared a prospectus to be used in soliciting financial support for the endeavor.\n\nThree-fourths of AGA members who work with the issuing of the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) feel that the standards have caused cost accounting practices to become more consistent. At the same time, half feel that the standards impose a significantly larger paperwork burden than did the Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR) and the Federal Procurement Regulations (FPR), over which the standards take precedence. Forty-four percent of the respondents further said that the quality of guidance provided by the standards was no better, or worse, than that of ASPR and FPR. The Association’s study was undertaken by an ad hoc committee of AGA’s Financial Management Standards Board.\n\nDecember 1977\n\nPast National President Ellsworth H. Morse Jr. has died suddenly of a heart attack. Comptroller General Elmer Staats said of the longtime GAO employee: “His host of friends both in and outside the General Accounting Office will feel this loss deeply…” Morse was 64.\n\nNEC appoints task forces to develop and implement ZBB research, one to work on state and local issues for President Murphy and a third to recommend revisions to the Code of Ethics.\n\nThe Harrisburg Chapter has changed its name to the Central Pennsylvania Chapter.\n\nMember retention numbers are better this year with only 9.6 percent of the members failing to pay their dues on time as opposed to 14 percent in 1976, 13 percent in 1975, 17 percent in 1974 and 12 percent in 1973.\n\nExecutive Vice President Dittenhofer advises chapter officers that they should be bonded after a chapter officer mishandled thousands of dollars belonging to the chapter.\n\nMunicipal Finance Officers Association and AGA to hold first mutual training session.\n\nJanuary 1978\n\nFrank Sato, deputy assistant secretary of defense (audit) and director of the Defense Audit Service, has been nominated to become AGA President-Elect. He is a member of the Northern Virginia Chapter.\n\nDespite a sizable cut in the funding of this year’s contract, AGA will maintain approximately the same number of Office of Minority Business Enterprise Courses (OMBE) as last year.\n\nSymposium plans are coming together for June 26–28 in San Francisco.\n\nDittenhofer addresses the question: Where do my dues go? He points out that last year AGA had to use some of its limited reserves to cover expenses and that publication expenses alone drained 61 percent of the revenue received from dues in 1977.\n\nNEC authorizes formation of Ethics Board to review the code and alleged violations.\n\nFebruary 1978\n\nAGA’s net membership figures at the end of January have surpassed last year’s June 30 end, with 9,097 active members. This is the earliest date that current membership has ever surpassed the past year’s high mark. New chapter activity is helping with membership growth: Springfield, IL was chartered in January and installations are scheduled for the Virgin Islands, Memphis and Little Rock. Other charter applications appear imminent from Lincoln/Omaha, Nebraska, Nashville and Frankfort, KY. The Springfield Chapter augments a growing number of AGA chapters in state capitals. The chapter’s 45 charter members include representation from the Illinois Office of Education and the Office of the Auditor General, among others. Thomas E. Erickson was elected to be the first president.\n\nA recent sampling of opinion indicates that AGA members as a whole feel strongly that the Association’s National President should be an active government employee. The question was part of a poll taken to gauge AGA members’ thoughts on the fairness of the bylaws, which basically preclude non-government and retired members from holding the offices of national and chapter president as well as regional vice president.\n\nDittenhofer expresses concerns about the Association’s reserves, which have shrunk from $100,000 at the end of 1975 to just over $40,000 today. The July 1, 1975 $5 increase in dues has been offset by the upward creep in prices, which has affected every aspect of our operation. Notes that by American Society of Association Executives standards, AGA should have $180,000 in reserve or net worth equal to one year’s gross revenues. Dittenhofer seeks suggestions from members on how to help this growing problem.\n\nMarch 1978\n\nSato confirmed as President-Elect.\n\nCurrent President-Elect Art Schoenhaut and Dittenhofer hold advance planning meeting for incoming regional vice presidents in Kansas City. The first of its kind meeting continues to be a tradition today.\n\nAGA initiates education newsletter—EduData went out to all members in March, with additional bi-monthly issues scheduled.\n\nAGA’s earlier steps to form a Cash Management Task Force are validated by President Carter’s commitment to improving cash management in government.\n\nEnd of February membership number is 9,372 active members, which is 750 more than last year. The Membership Committee plans to add new incentives to reach 10,000 by the end of the program year.\n\nNational Office is in the process of converting The Government Accountants Journal to a refereed professional journal, which will attract more contributions from academia because of the increased prestige associated with such a publication. The result should be more interest in government accounting and auditing on college campuses.\n\nApril 1978\n\nAs membership number hovers around 9,600, Membership Committee Chairwoman Audrey Dysland announces the “Wide Angle” membership focus for the remainder of the year—striving for diversity in the thrust toward new members, making sure that members look at ALL prospects for new members.\n\nThirty-seven outstanding workshops follow six individual tracks of specialization: federal/state/local auditing; federal/state/local accounting; professional self/development; automated data processing; financial management; industry relationships with federal financial management.\n\nMay 1978\n\nVirgin Islands Chapter brings 39 charter members and the president is Darrell Fleming. The Memphis Chapter was given an original charter even though it has been chartered in 1960 but has been defunct for a number of years. The new group brings 31 charter members and Russell E. Elmore is the first president. The Central Arkansas Chapter in Little Rock brought 24 charter members and elected State Legislative Auditor Orvel M. Johnson as its first president.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget has published the AGA Review Guide for Grantees’ Financial Management Systems for use by federal agencies last month. The guide was a major AGA research initiative and was presented to the administration by AGA’s Research Board, chaired by Past National President John Cooley.\n\nThe National Finance Committee recommends a three-step dues increase after an extensive review of AGA’s current financial picture and its future needs. The proposal includes an immediate (July 1) increase of $5 over the current $22.50 dues rate, with additional increases of $2.50 in each of the following two years. At press time, there was a 3-to-1 trend in support of the recommended increase among the National Board of Directors. A two-thirds margin is needed for the increase to pass.\n\nAGA seeks a director of socio-economic activities in the National Office to oversee the OMBE program and other similar programs that may develop.\n\nJune 1978\n\nThe Association’s net membership figures pass the magic 10,000 mark in early May and an elated national membership committee was thinking that the 10,500 mark might be attainable by June 30. The unexpectedly high number of charter members brought onboard by the newly chartered Nashville Chapter helped the surge. Three factors aided the achievement of this mark: first was the very high membership retention from last year, second was the record of six new chapters installed by May 1and the third was the outstanding recruitment efforts of chapters and individual members throughout AGA.\n\nRobert L. Turner, administrative officer with HUD’s Federal Insurance Administration in Washington, has been named AGA’s new director of education. Audrey Dysland, past president of the Washington, D.C. Chapter and recently retired from the treasury department, will join the staff as director of finance and services.\n\nNEC approves a dues hike of $5 immediately and $2.50 for each of the following two years. Was approved by the NBD by a margin of nearly 3-to-1. President Murphy, who is also chair of the Long-Range Planning Board, recommends significant expansion in the size and scope of the board, including providing program assumptions for the Finance Committee’s five-year financial plan for the Association.\n\nAGA was to meet again with representatives from five countries to discuss the formation of a consortium on Government Financial Management.\n\nNEC decides to allow some nonaccountant specialties performing financial management functions to qualify for full AGA membership. Cited were such positions as program and management analysts, contract specialists, management auditors, ADP systems analysts, etc. No change in bylaws is deemed necessary to embrace the policy.\n\nEditorial Board is formed for The Government Accountants Journal.\n\nAugust 1978\n\nArthur Schoenhaut is now National President.\n\nA year of records concludes: AGA membership (more than 10,000); chapters (83); most education events in one year, plus the first to be conducted in a foreign country (Mexico); the most OMBE courses (50) and graduates (1,200); and highest attendance at a symposium outside of Washington (862 in San Francisco).\n\nTwo new awards were presented at the symposium: for research accomplishment and for outstanding chapter newsletters.\n\nMrs. Ellsworth Morse Jr. accepts the Robert W. King Memorial Award, granted posthumously to her husband.\n\nNBD approves fiscal year 1979 budget of $627,400 in revenue and total expenses of $602,929. AGA’s education program is expected to generate $257,500 in revenues, which for the first time will exceed dues income of $250,850. NBD has lengthy controversial discussion about the perennial question of how to split revenues from events sponsored jointly by local chapters and the National Office. Referred to the NEC for action.\n\nAGA’s National Research Board issues study on the first year of Zero Base Budgeting in the federal government. The authors believe the administration tried to do too much during the first year of using ZBB. As a result, the overall benefits of ZBB were impaired.\n\nSeptember 1978\n\nAlthough AGA believes the legislation establishing inspectors general in federal agencies to be significantly beneficial, it has detected some serious flaws in the original proposals and has expressed concern to the appropriate authorities.\n\nThe Association has provided detailed input to the President’s Pay Agent on the issue of federal pay scales.\n\nThe Washington Post publishes a review of the AGA National Research Board’s report on the first year of ZBB in the federal government, “sensationalizing” the problems identified by the report rather than the refinements suggested.\n\nRichard Griffen Jr. joins the staff as Director of Socio-Economic Programs.\n\nAGA and the Municipal Finance Officers Association sponsor two-day conference, Emerging Issues—Government Accounting and Auditing, in Detroit.\n\nOctober 1978\n\nAGA’s 84th chapter was installed in August. The Central Kentucky Chapter came with 49 new members. Ronald L. Cooper is the first president. While the group followed the recent trend of opting for a “geographical area” chapter name rather than identifying with a specific city, the chapter location actually encompasses a 50-mile radius around the state capital of Frankfort. The chapter’s membership rolls show a heavy concentration of state employees.\n\nNEC moves to increase the number of regions from nine to 11, as of July 1. This is due to the disparity in the number of chapters per region, with some having as few as four chapters and others having as many as 15.\n\nAGA continues its involvement in CARD—Council of Accounting Research Directors.\n\nRobert Turner vacates National Office education director post to return to his previous employer. Registrar Susie Maruyama leaves her post as registrar after three years with AGA.\n\nNovember 1978\n\nLaurence E. Olewine, who served as acting director of education on a part-time basis for most of the past year, has been permanently named to the post.\n\nWA \"Bill\" Broadus Jr., chair of AGA’s Subcommittee on Relations with the AICPA, appeared before the State of Board of Accountancy in Kentucky to speak out against a proposed amendment that would place additional requirements on state government accountants and auditors seeking CPA certificates.\n\nWork has already begun on the national symposium, scheduled for June 18–20, 1979 in St. Louis.\n\nSeries of cost accounting standards workshops co-sponsored with the National Contract Management Association are conducted in 15 cities with more than 1,500 people attending.\n\nDecember 1978\n\nAGA’s Financial Management Standards Board explores ways to involve greater number of members in its deliberations on items that come before it for action.\n\nAnother state capital chapter forming in Des Moines, with 21 potential charter members.\n\nJoint Financial Management Improvement Program celebrates 30th Anniversary.\n\nNational Office develops a chapter operations manual for officers and committees.\n\nAGA urges caution in selecting new IGs. If the newly authorized inspectors and auditors general in federal departments and agencies are not selected in the “most professional and nonpartisan manner possible, the entire program could falter or be discredited at the outset. AGA recommends the establishment of an advisory body to consult on the qualifications of the nominees and to make recommendations to the President; and cautions against excess emphasis on investigative and prosecution experience over “auditors knowledgeable and experienced in control systems and other preventative measures.”\n\nJanuary 1979\n\nFrederick Neuman, director, Defense Contract Audit Agency, has been nominated to become President-Elect of AGA.\n\nThe White House is close to naming the first 12 IGs. Congressman Jack Brooks, chairman of the Legislation and National Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations, replied to letters to President Carter sent by AGA urging caution in selecting the new IGs. Brooks thanks the Association for its concern and contribution to the process.\n\nNEC rejects any idea of creating an official “inactive chapter” status for AGA chapters and rejected a recommendation of the National Bylaws Committee that there be a near-automatic revocation of a chapter charter when the active membership falls below 10 members. In rejecting these suggestions, the NEC expressed its opinion that adequate means of treating weak chapters exist currently with AGA bylaws and established policy.\n\nNEC votes to return the 1984 symposium to Washington.\n\nEmployment referral service continues to be a vital AGA program with 170 new applications on file as of November 1, 1978.\n\nFebruary 1979\n\nAGA welcomed its 85th chapter in Des Moines in January with 21 charter members.\n\nIn response to an informal request from the Civil Service Commission, AGA’s Subcommittee on Relations with the Civil Commission has offered its definition of the major characteristics of a professional auditor.\n\nComptroller General Staats cites AGA study in his annual report to Congress on the Cost Accounting Standards Board progress.\n\nFor the first time, ads for the symposium are being placed in outside publications, including Management Accounting and the Journal of Accountancy.\n\nMarch 1979\n\nNEC encounters controversy with move by President Schoenhaut to relocate the 1981 symposium from Miami Beach, citing concern over whether the very small chapter in Miami could provide the necessary support and would make it difficult to defend returning to Miami Beach for the third time in 11 years. The NEC determined it had a moral obligation to follow the body’s original decision, citing concern also that the Association’s credibility could be impaired by an effort to get out of its contract with the Miami hotel.\n\nDittenhofer urges chapters to properly plan their monthly meetings in advance to make them more valuable to members.\n\nNEC agrees to develop a common body of knowledge for the profession.\n\nApril 1979\n\nThree AGA leaders have among the first group of inspectors general: Frank Sato will go to the Department of Transportation; June Brown to the Department of the Interior; and Allen Reynolds to the Veterans Administration.\n\nAGA will establish student financial management clubs at colleges and universities under the sponsorship of local chapters.\n\nJames A. Robbins, national president in fiscal year 1962 and the Association’s first full-time executive director, died March 14 at his home in Boca Raton, FL.\n\nMay 1979\n\nA petitioning group in Pierre, SD will become AGA’s 86th chapter in June. The chapter will be known as AGA of Central South Dakota.\n\nAssociation’s common body of knowledge study sparks interest throughout the profession.\n\nAGA forms ad hoc committee on International Affairs under the leadership of Past National President Arthur Litke.\n\nJune 1979\n\nNew plan for symposium site selection divides the country into three sections based on the AGA member rolls, and will systematically rotate the symposium around the sections in proportion to the number of members in each section. The 1985 symposium would be the first to fall under this plan.\n\nMembership as of April 30 is at an all-time high of 10,568, which surpasses last June’s year-end figure of 10,272 (the net figure dropped back to 9,555 on October 31 as a result of suspensions).\n\nJuly–August 1979\n\nNearly 800 attend symposium in St. Louis with Senator Thomas F. Eagleton, Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Irving M. Pollack and Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats among the keynoters.\n\nFrank S. Sato becomes National President.\n\nNBD takes unprecedented action to revoke the charter of the Central Alabama (Birmingham) Chapter, which has been defunct for two years. The NBD approved a $2.50 dues increase as of September 1, 1979 and $2.50 more on July 1, 1980. There is still a $10 differential between full and associate member dues. The NBD also approved a budget that calls for $753,340 in expenditures and $820,050 in revenue.\n\nSeptember 1979\n\nEstablishment of committees or task forces on international affairs, legislative affairs and equal opportunity increase the Association’s profile in those areas.\n\nBismark-Mandan, North Dakota Chapter is welcomed with nearly 200 potential members. While the chapter is actually the Association’s 87th active chapter, it was granted charter No. 100.\n\nAs AGA enters its fifth year of operation under the current National Executive Committee (NEC) concept, it is clear that the Association has arrived at an effective means of governing its affairs.\n\nCountdown is on for the 1980 symposium in Boston, slated for June 16-18.\n\nNEC acts to create an Education and Research Institute.\n\nThe June 30, 1979 year-end net membership figure stood at 10,751,nearly 500 higher than the same date in 1978.\n\nOctober 1979\n\nNEC takes action to establish the new AGA Education and Research Foundation.\n\nAGA continues to expand into state capitals with the chartering of the Greater Lansing Chapter in Michigan.\n\nThe NEC votes to revoke the West Palm Beach Chapter’s charter after several years of inactivity.\n\nAGA has charged that Congress, in artificially keeping a “pay cap” on top federal salaries, is effectively negating the many advantages cited by that body when it created the Senior Executive Service.\n\nNovember 1979\n\nThe Education and Research Foundation moved forward with a corporate charter granted by the state of Virginia and approval of the basic concept by the NBD.\n\nNew chapter formed in Colorado Springs—AGA of Pikes Peak, with 27 charter members. Francis L. Mickle Jr. is the first president.\n\nDecember 1979\n\nNational Membership Committee sets 12,000 as goal for the year.\n\nTokyo group surprises National Office with a petition for a new chapter. In 1953, charter No. 6 went to the Tokyo Chapter, which folded in the mid-1960s when American presence in Japan dwindled. The new group boasts 22 charter members and Robert Lloyd is the first president.\n\nAudrey Dysland leaves director of finance and services post in the National Office to take a position with the Institute for Public Administration.\n\nJanuary 1980\n\nNEC gives final approval to the Education and Research Foundation. The NEC also revoked the charters of three inactive chapters (Missoula, Rochester and Syracuse) and placed the remaining members in the\n\nAt-Large membership category; designated formal duties for the RVPs; approved two new research projects and associated grants; and authorized action to secure a protective copyright on AGA’s official name and logo.\n\nFebruary 1980\n\nEleanor Clark and Joseph Donlon, both members of AGA’s Washington Chapter, will vie for the office of National President-Elect in the Association’s first member-wide balloting for national officers in four years. The single-slate strategy was abandoned when the Nominating Committee became deadlocked and was unable to settle on a single candidate for president. The even-numbered committee was bound to deadlock eventually and will be odd-numbered in the future.\n\nEthics Board produces Ethics Handbook, containing the Code of Ethics, pertinent extracts from the Association’s bylaws and newly approved Ethics Board policies and procedures.\n\nDittenhofer comments on Association’s finances, noting that the revenue excess has increased over the past few years, but that inflation is having the same effect on AGA that it is having on everyone else.\n\nMarch 1980\n\nNEC puts implementation of foundation on hold when it becomes clear that the organizational and operational relations between the foundation and its AGA parent entity will be complex. There is concern that AGA’s general financial health could be severely affected by the loss of the net revenues from the symposium, which would accrue to the foundation and could not legally be transferred to or used by AGA. Agree to examine alternative ways to structure the foundation.\n\nAGA’s net membership figure of 10,856 at the end of January set a record as the earliest date that the current year’s membership surpassed the previous year’s high mark (10,751 on June 30).\n\nApril 1980\n\nAGA’s new computer terminal in the National Office went fully online on April 1, and members can expect faster and more accurate membership records as a result. Technicians installed the system, including a keyboard and a CRT display, and hooked it into the computer at AGA’s service bureau in downtown Washington.\n\nMembership surged past 11,000 for the first time in February.\n\nDittenhofer lauds this year’s membership-wide voting for National President-Elect and calls it “a healthy method of self-governance.”\n\nOffice of Minority Business Enterprise (OMBE) is replaced in the Department of Commerce by the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) and while Commerce indicates it does not intend to abandon the minority small business community, it seems clear that its level of support will be less than it has been in the past. How this will affect AGA’s grant to provide local training to minority business people is unknown.\n\nMay 1980\n\nOrange County, CA Chapter to become AGA’s 87th active chapter, bringing 30 new members. Fred R. Lang to be first president.\n\nAGA regains its nonprofit mailing privileges. Following a routine review of its objectives and programs by the Postal Service last year, AGA had its nonprofit mailing status, which had been in effect for more than 20 years, revoked by postal authorities. (The USPS maintained that AGA’s corporate charter and bylaws did not clearly establish the Association as falling into one of the qualifying categories: educational, charitable, religious, etc.). The ruling brought a sudden heavy burden down on AGA, increasing its bulk mailing costs by 117 percent overnight. The increase cost the Association thousands of dollars. The Education and Research Foundation was conceived in an attempt to qualify for nonprofit mailing rates through its purely educational status. The foundation ran into difficulties when members grew concerned about the overall financial effect for AGA. In exploring alternatives to the original foundation concept, the staff and members went back to the USPS with a strongly worded argument that AGA’s basic objectives were, in fact, educational and postal authorities eventually agreed. This meant, of course, that the largest single benefit of the foundation had been achieved through other means. An ad hoc committee studying the foundation was to make recommendations at the May NEC meeting.\n\nMembership as of April 30 was at 11,309.\n\nNational Office seeks member demographic information to determine how many women members we have, how many are CPAs or other certifications and what is the median grade level in the membership today?\n\nJune 1980\n\nNEC modifies the Education and Research Foundation. The foundation will serve as a conduit for the receipt, disbursement and administration of tax-deductible grants and donations for education and research purposes. The Association’s ongoing education program will revert to the control of the parent AGA organization as before.\n\nEllie Clark is elected President-Elect and will be the Association’s first female National President. She is associate director, management, for the National Technical Information Service.\n\nJuly–August 1980\n\nNearly 800 registrants attend annual symposium in Boston. Sessions cover the gamut from auditor independence to developments in state/local accounting to a session on the growing issues surrounding the world energy problem.\n\nNBD approves budget of $875,000 in projected revenues and $845,000 in projected expenses. Approves new national/chapter split for symposium revenues that solves the age-old question of whether to charge National Office expenses to run the symposium before or after calculating the chapter’s share. The NBD votes to charge the expenses before calculating the chapter’s share. All changes to the structure are effective with the 1985 symposium.\n\nMort Dittenhofer submits resignation as executive vice president. New National President Fred Neuman seeks candidates for the post, which Dittenhofer will vacate after three years.\n\nSeptember 1980\n\nSearch committee seeks replacement for Dittenhofer, who returns to academia with these words for AGA: “I have enjoyed my work with the chapters and their members , and I believe we have achieved some significant accomplishments in the last three years.”\n\nMBDA training is put on hold as AGA seeks other sources of funding after a shift in the Department of Commerce’s priorities result in the agency’s failure to renew AGA’s grant.\n\nNeuman sets theme of 1981 symposium in Miami as “Government Financial Management…A Professional and Proud Career.” Names Paul Carren as chairman and Nathan Cutler and co-chairman.\n\nOctober 1980\n\nPresident Neuman makes tracking and acting on legislation in the government financial management arena a major theme of his presidency.\n\nNEC reverses earlier decision to prevent those who are not active government employees from holding elected national offices (president and regional vice president) stating that anyone who qualifies for full membership should be allowed to hold any AGA office. This opens the door, in particular, to private sector and retired members who wish to hold national office. Subject to NBD approval.\n\nThe NEC also approved a plan to continue the MBDA program in conjunction with the New School of Social Research in New York.\n\nCongress fails to renew general revenue sharing.\n\nThe Cost Accounting Standards Board went out of business at the end of September, despite strong efforts by AGA and others to save it by transferring its authorities and functions to OMB.\n\nNew shorter formatted TOPICS debuts with brief news bullets and fewer pages.\n\nNovember 1980\n\nAGA’s Long-Range Planning Board hold unique overnight meeting to chart Association’s future.\n\nJohn P.

The Bylaws and Procedures Committee expedited the required changes in time for this year’s nominating procedures. Proponents of the move noted that the restriction was unfair to a large number of highly active members and pointed to the recent move by the AICPA to remove restrictions on nonpracticing CPAs holding certain positions within the Institute.\n\nDecember 1980\n\nLong-Range Planning Board sets goals, refines “who we are” and “where we want to be.” States that “AGA is a professional association of individuals engaged in government auditing, accounting, budgeting and information systems.” Goals include 10,000 AGA education student days by fiscal year 1986; 17,000 members by the end of fiscal year 1986; fund the foundation research program in an amount not to exceed $20,000 annually; decided not to pursue the purchase of a National Office building for the next five years; and decided not to change its fiscal year to match the federal calendar.\n\nJanuary 1981\n\nNEC ratifies charter for chapter in American Samoa with 40 new members and Falema’o Pili as the first president.\n\nThe Office of Federal Procurement Policy has submitted to Congress its proposal for a Uniform Procurement System (UPS) to minimize the federal government’s regulatory impact on the commercial marketplace.\n\nHal Stugart to head new standing committee charged with identifying and endorsing AGA candidates for key government financial executive vacancies.

Chapter.\n\nAn Intergovernmental Committee for Single Audit Implementation has been organized and will look into the implementation of the single audit approach, make recommendations to resolve them and provide general assistance in the implementation of the single audit approach. Sponsored by JFMIP.\n\nAGA plans testimonial dinner to honor Elmer B. Staats as he ends his 15-year term as comptroller general of the United States.\n\nPast National President Arthur Schoenhaut presents the AGA position on internal control in government to a House subcommittee considering an amendment to the Inspector General Act of 1978 that would extend the concept of independent inspectors general to other major federal departments and agencies. AGA wholeheartedly endorses this concept.\n\nMarch 1981\n\nFrederic A. Heim Jr., a member of the Northern Virginia Chapter, is named President-Elect. He is deputy inspector general for audit at the Department of Commerce.\n\nNEC makes sharp cuts in AGA’s operating budget for the current year to offset impending deficit at the end of the year. The loss of the MBDA grant and the revocation of the Association’s nonprofit mailing permit had combined to turn the Association’s financial picture around.\n\nNEC recommends a dues increase of $5 per year effective on July 1, 1981 and sent the proposal to the NBD for consideration.\n\nAGA sends letter to President Reagan strongly endorsing internal controls in government and urging effective implementation of the Inspector General Act.\n\nPresident’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency founded on March 26, to provide Administration leadership to the inspectors general.\n\nApril 1981\n\nAfter two years of planning, the AGA National Task Force on Cash Management has received approval of the NEC for a state-of-the-art study of the cash management area.\n\nAGA testifies on the Hill in support of The Federal Managers Accountability Act of 1981” which would, among other things, amend the Accounting and Auditing Act of 1950 to require public reporting on the adequacy of systems of internal accounting and administrative controls by heads of executive agencies.\n\nProposal to form a Governmental Accounting Standards Board is causing major controversy. The Financial Accounting Foundation expresses serious concern and reservations over the proposal. AGA members urged to become familiar with the issues involved.\n\nThree prominent AGA members were among eight nominees to the post of comptroller general submitted by a special bipartisan congressional committee to President Reagan. The three are Charles Bowsher, Arthur Anderson & Co.; James F. Antonio, Missouri State Auditor; and Frank Sato, Department of Transportation and an AGA Past National President.\n\nMay 1981\n\nNBD rejects $5 dues increase with a vote of 70 in favor and 71 opposed. A favorable vote of two-thirds would have been necessary to enact the increase. With this vote, the NBD rejected the recommendations of a special dues subcommittee, which conducted an in-depth analysis of the Association’s finances; the National Finance Committee; the National Executive Committee and the elected national officers.\n\nJohn P. Abbadessa has resigned as executive vice president after only three months on the job. The search committee that named him to the post has been reconvened to continue the search.\n\nBill introduced to require the federal government to prepare and publish annual consolidated financial statements using the accrual method of accounting. In presenting the legislation, Rep. Bill Young (R-FL) asserts that the government has no precise idea of where it stands financially because it does not compile such statements.\n\nAn AGA member has been expelled from the Association by the National Ethics Board after pleading guilty to two counts—false pretense and attempted false pretense—after he admitted to the willful preparation and presentation of false reports and untrue statements to a government agency.\n\nJune 1981\n\nAGA’s Financial Management Standards Board members, testifying in hearings on the proposed Governmental Accounting Standards Board in Philadelphia in early May, opposed the formation of a fully separate and independent GASB as a solution which would aggravate rather than solve governmental accounting problems. Bert Bodenheimer, who chairs AGA’s prestigious board, said his group recommended the creation of a new body under the auspices of the Financial Accounting Foundation to develop governmental accounting standards.\n\nU.S. Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee will be the symposium keynoter in Miami Beach.\n\nMembership as of June 30, 1981 was 11,894, up 64 members from last year’s end.\n\nAugust 1981\n\nEleanor Clark becomes the first woman to be AGA National President.\n\nNBD approves budget of $722,934 in projected revenue and $732,411 in projected expenses. Board members debate again the recent rejection of the dues increase and a motion to reconsider the request was defeated.\n\nCharles A. Bowsher, CPA, is nominated by President Reagan to be the next comptroller general of the United States. In addition, the President has named 16 nominees to fill the inspector general positions he vacated last January. AGA’s Search for Government Financial Executives Committee made strong recommendations on behalf of Bowsher and the other AGA members nominated to these top posts.\n\nPast National President Donald L. Scantlebury died June 18 after a heart attack in his Virginia home. Scantlebury was for many years the director of the Finance and General Management Studies Division of the U.S. General Accounting Office before being named last October to the newly created post of chief accountant at GAO. He was 53. At the time of his death, Scantlebury was the chair of the committee seeing a new executive vice president. Past National President Gerald Murphy takes over the post. National President Clark appoints Fletcher Lutz as interim executive vice president.\n\nSeptember 1981\n\nPresident Clark establishes standing committee to again explore the question of a certification program in the government accounting area. Joseph Donlon will head the committee.\n\nOctober 1981\n\nW. Fletcher Lutz named executive vice president. He is a Past National President and has been an active AGA member since 1952.\n\nFor more than 30 years, the Association has conducted National Symposia at various locations around the country. And there is no question that the efforts have been rewarding to those who attended. However, as we move into the ‘80s, the term “symposium” just doesn’t seem to convey the true spirit and objectives of these annual gatherings. So, to reflect this changing environment, our annual meeting will now be called the Professional Development Conference (PDC). The first PDC will be in Denver on June 14–16, 1982.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Foundation, which had earlier opposed a separate Governmental Accounting Standards Board, has now indicated its support of the current GASB proposal that would establish a GASB under the oversight of the FAF. The FAF also agreed to the GASB organizing committee’s suggestion to expand the FAF board to include three governmental members.\n\nDecember 1981\n\nExecutive Vice President W. Fletcher Lutz appeared before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs in mid-November to testify on behalf of AGA in strong support of The Financial Integrity Act of 1981. Among other things, it would amend the Accounting and Auditing Act of 1950 to require public reporting on the adequacy of systems of internal accounting and administrative controls by heads of executive agencies.\n\nAICPA reports that the number of its member CPAs in government is holding steady at 3.3 percent, which is fairly close to where it has been for the past 10 years. With the AICPA’s membership at 173,900 this year, that would put membership of government CPAs at 5,700.\n\nJanuary–February 1982\n\nSusumu Uyeda, a member of the Washington, D.C. Chapter and currently the capital region vice president, has been named by the National Nominating Committee as its single-slate candidate for AGA President-Elect.

Shapiro, Montgomery-Prince Georges Chapter, has qualified by petition as a candidate for National President-Elect of AGA, and will face Susumu Uyeda, the National Nominating Committee’s candidate. Qualification of an additional candidate will require a membership vote.\n\nThe National Ethics Board has expelled a member who is accused of causing a shortage of funds when he was chapter president.\n\nSeven years after moving to admit nonfederal members, AGA now has membership breakdown by employer category:\n\nFederal—63 percent\n\nState/local—21 percent\n\nPrivate industry—11 percent\n\nRetired & academia—5 percent\n\nMay 1982\n\nNew chapter chartered in Quantico, VA. The Virginia Battlefield Chapter was installed with 27 charter members, 20 of whom currently hold membership in other AGA chapters. James M. Bridges was installed as temporary president. In addition, four current members and 25 prospective members have banded together to form a chapter in southern Maine. Raymond G. Daigle is serving as chapter president.\n\nAGA’s Financial Management Standards Board had a productive year, commenting on behalf of the Association on the following exposure drafts: International Federation of Accountants’ proposed audit guideline “Using the Work of an Internal Auditor;” The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s proposed statement “Accounting for the Sale or Purchase of Tax Benefits Through Lease Transactions;” and the AICPA’s “Proposed Statement of Auditing Standards—Reporting on Condensed Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data.”\n\nSen.

Other professional organizations have lost 20 to 40 percent of their members during these difficult economic times.\n\nAICPA moves to support the single audit concept, but urges Congress to allow sufficient time to develop and analyze the advantages and disadvantages before passing any legislation mandating its use.\n\nWho are the Big Eight accounting firms? Coopers & Lybrand; Touche Ross; Arthur Young; Arthur Andersen; Ernst & Whitney; Peat, Marwick; Deloitte, Haskins & Sells; and Price Waterhouse.\n\nJuly–August 1982\n\nPDC in Denver judged “outstanding in every way.” Well over 600 registrants came despite earlier concerns about low registration due to the poor economic climate and tight travel restrictions.\n\nFrederic A. Heim Jr. accepts the gavel as National President, indicates his intention to establish the Board for Advancement of Financial Managers to promote the development of the profession and the Association Services Board to plan and direct all membership promotion/retention activities and chapter services. He also plans to further AGA’s support of the Government Accounting Standards Board, to obtain passage of the Financial Integrity Act and to speed implementation of the singe audit concept.\n\nNational Board of Directors approves a fiscal year 1983 budget that calls for balanced revenues and expenses of $566,000.\n\nAGA’s education program will begin the fiscal year 1983 with sessions on the Prompt Payment Act as well as the Single Audit and Governmental Accounting.\n\nSeptember 1982\n\nAssociation Services Board will be chaired by Harold Stugart and will consolidate the former committees that dealt with chapter activities, membership and employment referrals. Under the auspices of the board, President Heim suggests forming the following new committees: Chapter Competition, Chapter Assistance, Membership Acquisition, Membership Retention and Employment Referral. Wilbur D. Campbell will chair the other new board, the Financial Management Enhancement Board, which will be the coordinating advisory body for anything relating to the enhancement of financial management and financial managers.\n\nOMB issues rules for implementing the Prompt Payment Act, which calls for a 15.5 percent interest penalty when an agency is more than 15 days late in making payments to contractors.\n\nOctober 1982\n\nNEC approves a charter of a new chapter in Saipan to be known as the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Chapter. The new chapter is located some 100 miles north of Guam in the Western Pacific Ocean and has 36 charter members.\n\nThe Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982 was signed into law by President Reagan in September. OMB notes that the act closely parallels the provisions of Circular A-123, “Internal Control Systems,” which:\n\nEstablishes standards for internal controls,\n\nRequires agencies to make vulnerability assessments and internal control reviews,\n\nCalls for internal reports on systems breakdowns.\n\nThe OMB further notes that the act requires more extensive reporting than required by A-123, and directs OMB to issue implementing guidelines. More than two years ago, an AGA task force, led by National President-Elect Susumu Uyeda studied the proposed legislation and issued a report on standards and procedures that could be followed if and when such legislation was passed.\n\nPlans are coming together for the 1983 PDC in Chicago, which is set for June 20–22. This year’s theme of “Improving Accountability and Credibility in Government” is reflective of efforts under way that are intended to restore public confidence in government programs.\n\nSherry A. Crittenden has been named AGA’s Director of Education.\n\nIn cooperation with AGA, Central Michigan University has recently developed a Master of Arts degree in Management and Supervision with a concentration of Governmental Accounting.\n\nNovember 1982\n\nThe education program includes seminars on Internal Controls and Single Audit One-Day Pilots.\n\nDecember 1982\n\nHarold L. Stugart, a member of the Northern Virginia Chapter, is the National Nominating Committee’s candidate for fiscal year 1984 President-Elect.\n\nA blue ribbon ad hoc group will study and make possible recommendations for significant changes to AGA’s basic governing structure. The action comes from a concept advanced last year by the Long-Range Planning and Organization Board, which perceived a need for strengthening AGA’s organization to enable more continuity in the leadership and operations. The ad hoc group, called the Strategic Planning Council, will be chaired by Joseph P. Welch, who is the inspector general at the U.S. Department of Transportation and a member of the Northern Virginia Chapter.\n\nThe National Office moves to change its chapter communication strategy. Previously, National Office Memorandums (NOMs) were the primary means of communication and were sent to all NBD members. This resulted in a heavy flow of paper to the NBD and confusion over action vs. information items. Under the new system, NOMs will cover one subject only and will be identified as “Action” or “Information.”\n\nJanuary 1983\n\nThe NEC has approved the reactivation of the Association’s Education and Research Foundation retroactive to July 1, 1982.\n\nNEC oversees automation of National Office; the Automated Data Processing Committee is reviewing two vendors’ systems\n\nFebruary 1983\n\nSaipan Chapter officially chartered as of December with 38 charter members, Thomas B.

Stugart, selected by the National Nominating Committee as its single-slate candidate, is elected.\n\nNEC votes to move the 1985 PDC from Hawaii to an alternate Section III location.\n\nAICPA government sector membership holds at just over 3 percent, but since overall AICPA membership has grown, so has the actual number of CPAs in government, from 4,150 in 1976 to more than 6,000 in 1982.\n\nMay 1983\n\nAlbert H. Wohlers and Co. is named new administrator of AGA’s group insurance programs, term life, group personal liability.\n\nAGA files with IRS for 501-© (3) status for the entire association and the application appears to be progressing favorably. While the Education and Research Foundation has had 501-© (3) status, the Association as a whole has been operating under 501-© (6), which doesn’t convey as favorable a status as © (3) does in relation to mail rates, tax deductible gifts etc. AGA is conforming certain documents as its Certificate of Incorporation to language more suitable to 501-© (3) designation. Hope to have it by the beginning of new fiscal year on July 1.\n\nStudent Chapter forms at Georgia State University, within the School of Accountancy. Fred Friedel, president, serves 25 members.\n\nIllinois Sen. Alan J. Dixon will be the keynote speaker at the Chicago PDC.\n\nGAO issues its 1982 annual report. National Defense Audits again led all others (192), followed by general government (116) and Energy (102). Financial Management and Information Systems placed a poor fourth, with 65 audits, which is still an improvement from last year when only 32 reports were issued.\n\nJune 1983\n\nNew PDC 1985 site: San Diego\n\nPresident-Elect Uyeda projects combined AGA and Foundation expenses/revenues of just over $1 million for the coming fiscal year.\n\nNEC terminates and revokes charter of SW Virginia (Roanoke area) Chapter.\n\nFinancial Accounting Foundation, with oversight of GASB, takes action to activate the new board by the end of the year.\n\nA study released by Robert Half Institute notes that executives who lack basic ADP skills will soon be unable to compete. Five years ago, the study noted that 61 percent of all financial executive position requests included a preference for ADP skills with 29 percent insisting on it. Today those numbers are 85 and 46 percent respectively.\n\nEthics Board urges better internal controls in chapters “such discrepancies are especially critical and potentially embarrassing to an organization of professional accountants and auditors.”\n\nStrategic Planning Council recommends changes in governance.\n\nJuly–August 1983\n\nChicago PDC draws 700-plus registrants. President Uyeda accepts the gavel from outgoing President Heim. Uyeda urges effort to win a prominent place as equal partners in management and prove benefit of financial management service to managers. Second concern – consolidation of technology in agencies – will all these new systems ultimately fit together to allow for meaningful decision-making?\n\nNBD approves budget of $770,400 in revenues and $848,600 in expenses. Deficit of $78,200 is due to PDC revenue, which normally offsets operating losses for the year, will be held in July of 1984. Accounting-wise, that means no PDC in FY84. Officials expect revenue from 84PDC in Washington to offset deficit.\n\nNBD, acting on recommendation from Strategic Planning Council, reduces its size from 180 to 122.\n\nSeptember 1983\n\nCommittee structure is reorganized: the new Administrative Board oversees the activities of the Audit, Bylaws and Procedures, History and PDC Site Selection Committees. Nelson H. Shapiro, a member of the Montgomery/Prince Georges County Chapter, will chair the board. Also, a State and Local Government Task Force has been formed with the charge of bringing state and local members more into the AGA mainstream and to determine how AGA can more effectively serve this growing segment of its membership. Donald O. Cox, a member of the Austin Chapter, will chair this task force.\n\nThe Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) agreement is “very much on hold” as representatives of the original approving organizations and seven groups representing state, county and local government officials debate changes to the agreement.\n\nMembers of the Municipal Finance Officers Association will vote later this year on whether to change their organization’s name to the Government Finance Officers Association.\n\nThe Senate bill has been introduced to “establish uniform single audit requirements for state and local governments and nonprofit organizations and other recipients of federal assistance.”\n\nOctober 1983\n\nCharter No. 113 was granted to the new Coastal Georgia Chapter, located in the Savannah area. The new chapter has 55 members and Roger Bowling is the interim president. The chapter has a diverse makeup with members coming from the federal, state, county and city areas as well as local CPA firms.\n\nPresident Uyeda offers member satisfaction ratings based on his conversations with members during his travels. On the question of “Has AGA succeeded in fostering better communications, coordination and cooperation among all levels of government?” he said the organization rates an 8 out of 10. But on the question of “Has AGA been reasonably responsive to the needs of the state and local members?” On this point, Uyeda gave the Association a 4 out of 10. He outlines a number of initiatives intended to increase the grade in this area.\n\nThe National Membership Board sets a goal of 13,200 members by April 30, 1984, which would represent a 10 percent net growth increase in just one year.\n\nAGA’s education program includes courses on internal controls, single audit concepts and introduction to microcomputers.\n\nNovember 1983\n\nPresident Uyeda announces the formation of a new Financial Management in the Federal Government Task Force, which will review selected recommendations being made by the Grace Commission on the structure of financial management in government.

The board has asked the Education Board and PDC Program Committee to include more training opportunities that will be of interest to these members and potential members.\n\nTheme and logo for 1984 PDC in Washington, D.C. are approved—Reform and Technology: A Renaissance in Government.\n\nAssociation issues Annual Report. For fiscal year 1983, AGA had $682,000 in revenue and $666,000 in expenses. The $16,000 in excess revenue over expense was added to the equity fund.\n\nThe Chapter Competition Committee has authorized 30 points per member hour, or a maximum of 2,500 points per year, to be awarded to chapters that participate in the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program.\n\nJanuary 1984\n\nJune Gibbs Brown, inspector general at NASA, has been chosen as the National Nominating Committee’s single-slate candidate for President-Elect. Her term as National President would begin on July 1, 1985. She would be the second woman to hold the Association’s highest elected office and was one of the first two women to serve on the Association’s National Executive Committee.\n\nAGA’s total active membership, which had been flirting with the 12,000 mark for some time, pushed over that magic number for the first time at the end of November when membership reached 12,014.\n\nThe 1984 PDC will feature sessions on operational accounting, conducting internal controls reviews, operational auditing and microcomputer usage in financial management.\n\nThe Senate has approved the Uniform Single Audit Act of 1983, but the House indicates that single audit bill is not high on its 1984 legislative agenda.\n\nFor the first time in New York State’s history, the annual financial statements reflecting the state’s financial condition have been certified as to their reliability by independent, outside auditors.\n\nThe House of Representatives is debating legislation to install inspectors general in the Departments of the Treasury and Justice, the only two cabinet-level agencies without the position.\n\nFebruary 1984\n\nAGA welcomed its 92nd active chapter with the chartering of AGA of Central Louisiana.

Taylor as its president.\n\nWith AGA’s sponsorship, a new group called the Financial Managers’ Council has been formed to provide a forum to discuss mutual policy and operating problems such as the development of financial systems, payroll/personnel systems consolidations, cash management, etc. William L. Kendig, Ph.D., is the council’s first chairman.\n\nMembership set another record on December 31, 1983, with 12,085 members. This represents 452 more members than the same date in 1982.\n\nThere are now close to 6,600 CPAs working in government, according to the AICPA. With the society’s membership topping 200,000, the percentage of CPAs in government remains steady at 3.3 percent.\n\nMarch 1984\n\nJune Gibbs Brown and 13 Regional Vice Presidents are officially elected for fiscal year 1986.\n\nA plan for establishing the Governmental Accounting Standards Board to develop guidelines for financial accounting and reporting by state and local governments has been approved by the Financial Accounting Foundation, under whose auspices the new board will be organized and funded. The GASB will replace the National Council on Governmental Accounting, a part-time voluntary body that is affiliated with the Municipal Finance Officers Association. NCGA statements will remain in effect until replaced or modified by GASB.\n\nThe President’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE), which is chaired by OMB Deputy Director Joseph Wright and comprised mainly of agency IGs, has reported nearly $31 billion in savings and improved use of funds since its inception in March of 1981. The PCIE is placing its focus on preventing problems before they occur through sophisticated prevention techniques.\n\nThe “Grace Commission,” in its study on controlling costs in government, presented findings and recommendations that it said could save $400 billion over the next three years. Critics call the report inaccurate, shallow and attest that the recommendations are infeasible. OMB states that the largest single savings put forth by the report—involving changes in federal retirement programs—would not have much significance until early in the next century.\n\nApril 1984\n\nAGA will affiliate with two government employee coalitions to gain a louder voice in matters pertaining to government personnel and career matters.
