        "text": "International Superstar, Gloria Estefan, is a Grammy Award-winning singer, actress, songwriter, author of two New York Times best-selling children’s books, philanthropist and humanitarian. She is considered one of the world’s most recognizable and beloved performers and the most successful Latin crossover artist in music history, per Billboard Magazine. Having sold over 100 million records worldwide, Estefan has garnered eight Grammy Awards and an Oscar nomination for her performance of the song “Music of My Heart.” She has received an American Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, and was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2015, President Obama honored Emilio & Gloria Estefan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation’s highest civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made meritorious contributions to the United States, world peace, and cultural endeavors. In 2017, Gloria was the first Cuban American singer-songwriter to receive The Kennedy Center Honors. In 2015, On Your Feet! the Tony Award-nominated Broadway musical based on the lives and music of Emilio & Gloria Estefan debuted on Broadway. Serving as Executive Producer alongside her husband Emilio, the musical is the story of two people who — through an unwavering dedication to one another and their pursuit of the American dream — showcased their talent, music, and heritage to the world in a remarkable rise to global superstardom. On Your Feet! has received rave reviews and nominations for Tony Awards, Outer Critics Circle Awards, Drama League Awards, and is now on tour worldwide. She is the founder of the Gloria Estefan Foundation whose mission is to support charitable programs for disadvantaged children and empower young people through education and opportunity. The Foundation also supports spinal cord research through the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. In 2020 her Grammy Award-winning album, Brazil305 topped the charts worldwide while she served as one of three hosts for her four-time Emmy nominated, Emmy winning, GLAAD Award nominated Facebook Watch series, “Red Table Talk: The Estefans.” Its 20 episodes are streaming now. In 2021, she voiced the character Marta in the critically acclaimed animated film Vivo, with music written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and released on Netflix. In the Summer of 2022, Estefan starred in Father of the Bride opposite Andy García airing on MAX. The movie amassed MAX’s biggest audience for a streaming-only film and soared to the No. 1 title spot across HBO worldwide. Her newest album released in 2022, the Estefan Family Christmas album features Gloria alongside her daughter, Emily (27), and grandson, Sasha (10), and is one of the first albums of its kind to combine three generations. It includes 12 Christmas classics and two original songs, one of which was written by Gloria, Emily, and Sasha.\n\nEmilio is a world-renowned music, television, and film producer who has been instrumental in shaping, developing, and directing the careers of his superstar wife, Gloria, as well as Shakira, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, and Jon Secada, among many others. Emilio has achieved incredible success throughout his career, boasting more than 40 years of industry-leading achievements, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and induction into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame just to name a few. Emilio has served as a member of the President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities and has produced a wide array of historical musical events at the White House. In 2009, President Barack Obama tapped him to serve on the committee to create the first National Museum of the American Latino and, in 2022, he was tasked by President Biden to produce the inaugural ceremony of The Summit of the Americas. With a resume that includes 19 Grammy Awards, Emilio has experimented and pushed the envelope of blending Latin, pop, and world rhythms creating a unique style and personality that has created chart-topping worldwide hits. It is this vision that transcends the music field and spills over into film, television, hotels, and restaurants, among other business endeavors including serving as the Executive Producer of the Tony Award-nominated smash Broadway musical, On Your Feet! Most recently, the Library of Congress honored Emilio and Gloria with the distinguished Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. His passion and ability to keep alive his Latin roots have made Emilio Estefan’s vision a global brand, and a symbol of credibility and prestige among the World’s Greatest Leaders; a man that through sheer talent, tenacity, and an extraordinary vision, has earned his rightful place in history."
