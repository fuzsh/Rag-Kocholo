        "text": "Acts from the American continent as a whole. American musicians pioneered jazz, blues, rock, country, hip-hop, techno, house, disco, RnB, funk, soul, swing, ragtime, punk, and emo.\n\nRelated tags: Canadian, Jamaican, Brazilian, Japanese, British\n\nNotable American acts include the two most popular solo artists in recorded music history, Elvis Presley (of Tupelo, Mississippi) and Michael Jackson (of Gary, Indiana). Both artists have sold over a billion records. During the 1960's, The Beach Boys drew comparison to The Beatles of Great Britain in terms of influence; their album Pet Sounds was cited as an inspiration for much of the Fab Four's post-1966 studio work. Seattle native Jimi Hendrix was arguably the most iconic musical act of the 1960's, though he spent much of his career as a resident in London. In 2016, Minnesota native Bob Dylan became the first musician to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. Other prominent 60s artists include Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, The Doors, The Grateful Dead, Marvin Gaye, Simon and Garfunkel, The Supremes, Jefferson Airplane, Roy Orbison, Frank Zappa, Santana, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Velvet Underground, Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, The Byrds, The Monkees, and The Stooges."
