        "text": "ABOUT SAMUEL BECKETT BY FEARGAL WHELAN\n\nBorn in Dublin, Ireland in 1906, Samuel Beckett has left a profound mark on theatre and literature worldwide in the twentieth and twenty-first century. Following a highly successful academic career at Trinity College Dublin, he zigzagged from home to Paris, London, and Germany attempting to build a career as a writer before eventually settling in the French capital in 1937. Writing in both French and English, he spent the rest of his years until his death in 1989 dedicated to producing a unique and personal examination of the human condition through a variety of literary forms. Deeply impacted by what he witnessed in World War II, in which he was active in the Resistance and won the French Croix de Guerre, Beckett embarked on a remarkable burst of writing in French marked by a trilogy of novels Molloy, Malone Dies and The Unnamable, and the play En Attendant Godot (Waiting for Godot) which was premiered in Paris in 1953. The work for which he is best remembered, Godot (once described as ‘a play in which nothing happens…twice) combines underlying nihilism and despair with depths of resilience, friendship, and comedy, in a tragic-comic blend that have attracted audiences ever since. When he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1969 the citation noted that ‘his writing, which - in new forms for the novel and drama - in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation’.\n\nBeckett challenges the limits of form in his works. He abandons all grammar in the novel How It Is and many of his later prose works, some poems become no more that a collection of a few words, while the narrators and narratives become blurred and interchangeable. On stage, he places bodies in giant urns or in ashcans (Play and Endgame), traps aging bodies in spotlights or mounds of dirt (Footfalls and Happy Days) or obliterates them completely until we are left with nothing but a disembodied mouth before us (Not I).\n\nBeckett’s legacy is such that the term ‘Beckettian’ has become commonplace. Godot is now so deeply embedded in popular culture that not alone has it attracted performers such as Steve Martin and Robin Williams, but it has also been referenced in Sesame Street, The Simpsons and Doonesbury. But at the end, what endures mostly is his invitation to humanity to bear witness and to endure: ‘you must can’t go on, I can’t go on, I’ll go on’."
