Less than 30 years later, only Liberia and Ethiopia remained unconquered by them. The rest–10 million square miles with 110 million bewildered new subjects–had been carved up by five European powers (and one extraordinary individual) in the name of Commerce, Christianity, 'Civilization' and Conquest. The Scramble for Africa is the first full-scale study of that extraordinary episode in history.\n\nAfrican Perspectives on Colonialism (Google Books)\n\nThis history deals with the twenty-year period between 1880 and 1900, when virtually all of Africa was seized and occupied by the Imperial Powers of Europe. Eurocentric points of view have dominated the study of this era, but in this book, one of Africa's leading historians reinterprets the colonial experiences from the perspective of the colonized.\n\nMichael Mwenso and Shenel Johns explore the power of the Black female voice and how it has remained an anchor in the world for hope, resistance and strength.\n\nSongs from this episode\n\nLive for Life, Abbey Lincoln\n\nAlbum: World is Falling Down\n\nBlack is the Color of My True Love's Hair, Nina Simone\n\nLet Up, Abbey Lincoln\n\nA New World Coming, Shenel Johns\n\nWith a voice that embodies grace and passion and a personal style that sways effortlessly from jazz to R&B to gospel, Shenel Johns has emerged as one of the shining stars of her generation.

She has shared the stage with music royalty including Curtis Fuller, Hank Jones, Dionne Warwick, and Sheila Jordan.\n\nJohns honored Billie Holiday as part of Jazz at Lincoln Center’s New York production of Billie and the Boys and also was in residence at Jazz at Lincoln Center Doha (Qatar). Johns has also performed a tribute to another of her idols, Lena Horne, at New York City’s famed Appel Theater.\n\nA native of Hartford, CT, Johns studied performance with such jazz legends such as Rene McLean, Jimmy Greene, and Nat Reeves. She graduated from the Jackie McLean Institute at the Hartt School of Music with a bachelor’s degree in music management.\n\nHooked and want to know more? Michael Mwenso suggests these books.\n\nI Put A Spell On You: The Autobiography of Nina Simone (Google Books)\n\nJames Baldwin used to tell Nina Simone, \"This is the world you have made for yourself, now you have to live in it.\" Simone has created for herself a world of magnificent peaks. Often compared to Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf, Simone is known as one of the greatest singers of her generation.\n\nBlack Resonance: Iconic Women Singers and African American Literature (Google Books)\n\nEver since Bessie Smith’s powerful voice conspired with the “race records” industry to make her a star in the 1920s, African American writers have memorialized the sounds and theorized the politics of black women’s singing. In Black Resonance, Emily J. Lordi analyzes writings by Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Gayl Jones, and Nikki Giovanni that engage such iconic singers as Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Mahalia Jackson, and Aretha Franklin.\n\nMichael Mwenso and Russell Hall dive into the philosophical impact the Afro-Caribbean protest movements had on Jazz and demonstrate how Jazz was the protest music of its time.\n\nSongs from this episode\n\nFables of Faubus, Charles Mingus\n\nHaitian Fight Song, Charles Mingus\n\nRussell Hall is an Emmy-, Grammy-, and Golden Globe-nominated jazz artist from Kingston, Jamaica.
