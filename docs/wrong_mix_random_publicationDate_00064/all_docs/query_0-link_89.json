        "text": "❛\n\nDonna Martin is a principal character on Beverly Hills, 90210. She is portrayed by Tori Spelling.\n\nCharacter[]\n\nDonna is an easy-going, good-spirited character with a rational, occasionally bold personality. She is introduced as a student of West Beverly High and was born to John and Felice Martin. Throughout high school, she forged bonds with seven friends who she would know well into her adult life, including her eventual love interest David Silver. Of the girls Donna knew during high school, she was closest to Kelly Taylor and Brenda Walsh. It was during this period that Donna declared her intentions to remain a virgin for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis decision would occasionally draw her and David apart from one another in the times to come. Donna struggled in High School though she tried to keep it a secret. She hid her insecurities by focusing on looking fashionable and being popular. At some point, she began to rebel by smoking cigarettes, skipping class, and hanging out with the wrong crowd, and it wasn't until she was confronted by Brenda that she was able to face that she had an issue, realizing that she wasn't stupid, but that she had a learning disability. Additionally, Donna found support from Brenda when she caught her mother cheating on her father. As the show reached its conclusion, Donna began running a fashion business with her best friend Kelly Taylor.\n\nWest Beverly[]\n\nDuring her freshman year, Donna spends her time with Kelly, who is building her status as one of the most popular girls at West Beverly. When Brenda meets Kelly and Donna in their sophomore year, Donna and Kelly always hang out together and often go shopping. Donna also throws a party at her parents' house when they're out of town and generally seems comfortable with her and Kelly's status and lifestyle.[2] Donna at first comes across as superficial but is later revealed to harbor an inferiority complex, as she feels her friends assume that she's stupid – which both Brenda and Kelly tell her they don't think at all.\n\nThese feelings are compounded when Donna receives a poor result on her SATs, but after talking to Mrs. Teasley, Donna learns that she has a learning disability and is therefore eligible to retake the test.[3]\n\nsummer '91[]\n\nDuring the summer, Donna decides to take drama class to get more credits with Andrea, Brenda, and David in summer school. David and Donna are reluctantly paired for a Romeo and Juliet scene as a class project. At the Beverly Hills Beach Club, Donna and Brenda decide to get tan before going to a party. Brenda then gets sun urn and tells Dylan that Donna is lucky that she did not get sun urn like her and that she get ready for \"party\" night at the beach club.\n\nBrandon, Brenda, Dylan, Kelly, Steve, Donna, Andrea and David take an end-of-the-summer camping trip to Yosemite National Park. Donna brings a lot of makeup and girl stuff causing Steve to get angry and they begin to argue, but Brandon quashes that disagreement saying they need to get moving. The group, however, failed to heed civil defense reports that a nasty thunderstorm was making its way through California, which resulted in lightning and heavy rains. As a result, the gang is thwarted shortly into their trip as the highway patrol closes the route the Yosemite, and the kids are stuck at a remote campground where the only lodging available is a ramshackle cabin. Steve tries to liven up the party by going into town and bribing adults to buy alcohol for him, but this plan backfires and an angry Steve returns, causing the group to get into a debate how teenagers are treated as second-class citizens. Donna avoids that debate, thinking maybe it is better that there is an age cap on alcohol. Later, when the kids are invited into a nice cabin by a couple that is just married, they are enjoying themselves until the couple has their first fight. Kelly, Brenda, and Donna try to smooth things over with the bride, and in doing so learn some of the facts of life.\n\njuniors[]\n\nDuring class, Steve and Donna decide to play the stock market. But Kelly disapproves and expresses Donna's waste of money. Donna is stubborn and refusse to listen to what Kelly said to her. Donna expresses that she is not stupid.
