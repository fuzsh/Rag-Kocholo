        "text": "Simon Holloway, Dunhill creative director\n\nYoung Mungo by Douglas Stuart\n\n“I couldn’t help but identify with the experience of the character on some level – with the sense of not quite belonging and wanting to escape. It’s a love story set amid destitution. It’s a beautiful book.”\n\nWalé Adeyemi, founder of streetwear label B-side\n\n“I Want You Forever” by Jeymes Samuel feat. D’Angelo and Jay-Z\n\n“The soundtrack to The Book of Clarence, a film directed by a friend of mine, Jeymes Samuel. There’s a track on there with D’Angelo and Jay-Z called “I Want You Forever” and it’s an incredible piece of music – all the instruments and the way it’s put together, it’s quite moving.”\n\nPieter Hugo, photographer\n\n“Cold Blooded” by Zhu\n\n“I’ve recently rediscovered gothy pop such as The Cure and The Yard. My daughter and I have discovered that our music tastes overlap. I spend a lot of time driving around with her and she often plays bands – Metronomy and Tame Impala – that remind me of music I used to listen to. Through her eyes I’ve rediscovered a genre that I haven’t listened to in ages. We have a combined playlist. The last song I downloaded was ‘Cold Blooded’ by American singer Zhu, which Spotify recommended to me.”\n\nAlexander Rash, founder of Serpent à Plume\n\nSister Carrie by Theodore Dreiser\n\n“It’s about a young woman who goes to Chicago, has a bunch of sex with random people and becomes quite prominent in society. It’s a great 1900s tale.”\n\nKim Sion, creative consultant and ceramicist\n\nUK Grim by Sleaford Mods\n\n“My favourite track is ‘So Trendy’. I find the lyrics very poignant.”\n\nSt Vincent, musician\n\nLove + Radio\n\n“I think Love + Radio is brilliant. It’s deeply odd, with subversive stories, and the sound design is epic. One that’s more lighthearted is Dear Joan and Jericha, where the hosts Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine play two agony aunts giving terrible and hilarious advice.”\n\nCourtney Love, musician\n\n60 songs That Explain the ’90s\n\n“60 Songs That Explain the ’90s, hosted by Rob Harvilla. He is God’s gift to bros and women. I went from “Bitter Sweet Symphony” to “Nookie” to “Zombie” and “Common People”. He’s hilarious. It’s never about what you think it’s about.”\n\nJune Ambrose, stylist and creative director\n\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving A F•ck by Mark Manson\n\n“The title is obnoxious, but when you dive into the book it’s more about unpacking trauma and not taking yourself too seriously. I think it’s a healthy read – I gave it to my kids, who are 19 and 22.”\n\nPierre Mahéo, founder of Officine Générale\n\nAlpha Zulu by Phoenix\n\n“The last music I downloaded was by Phoenix, the album Alpha Zulu, which was recorded in the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. I have been listening to it slowly – what I don’t like about the way we consume music at the moment is how we get through it too quickly, listening in the car and skipping through the songs. I think I’m going to go back to vinyl at home, where you can’t swipe.”\n\nLiz Lambert, hotelier and designer\n\n99% Invisible\n\n“99% Invisible, which is about the architecture and design that surrounds us. I always learn something from Death, Sex & Money, an NPR production on subjects ranging from facing your fears to infidelity to celebrity interviews. Articles of Interest and Hidden Brain are two others that I find fascinating because they dip into so many random topics. I spend so much time travelling that I’m always listening to a podcast.”\n\nFrida Escobedo, architect\n\nRed Scare\n\n“Red Scare, a cultural commentary; and A History of the World in 100 Objects by the BBC. I think it’s fascinating to understand the history of human culture through material artefacts. They hold so many stories. The episodes on the Mexican Codex Map and the Shadow Puppet of Bima are two of my favourites.”\n\nLuisa Beccaria, fashion and homewares designer\n\nThe Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\n\n“Each time I read it I learn something new – it’s very important to me as it helps me understand the Sicilian soul.”\n\nCarine Roitfeld, stylist\n\nThe Gambler by Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\n“The best book I’ve read in the past year is The Gambler by Dostoevsky. I’m very into Russian novels and can read and reread them. Otherwise I’m about to start Britney Spears’s memoir. She’s had so many problems in her life but seems like a lovely person. I want to know more about her.”\n\nGreg Chait, founder the Elder Statesman\n\n“Paid In Full” by Eric B & Rakim\n\n“I like older hip-hop because anything early has something pure about it; people were making stuff up and we didn’t have social media, so the sound was particular to that area. It brings me back to a place and time.”\n\nJessica Bell Brown, curator for contemporary art at the Baltimore Museum of Art\n\nTrust by Hernan Diaz\n\n“The best book I’ve read in the past year is Hernan Diaz’s Trust, which won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It’s an unintentional history of capital, philanthropy and robber barons; it shows you the underworld of America’s elite.”\n\nMin Jin Lee, author\n\nPivot\n\n“For tech and business, there’s Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway. For law and government, Stay Tuned with Preet with former US attorney Preet Bharara. For creativity, I turn to Design Matters with Debbie Millman. For screenwriting, Scriptnotes with John August and Craig Mazin is very good. For television, TV’s Top 5 with Lesley Goldberg and Daniel Fienberg. For news and politics, The Ezra Klein Show is excellent.”\n\nJohn Derian, artist\n\nSavage Lovecast\n\n“Dan Savage’s Savage Lovecast, which is all about sex and politics; Right, Left & Center, which covers more politics and pop culture; and SmartLess with Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett, which is pure comedy, with a surprise guest every episode. This is our trio for long car rides to the Cape.”\n\nMichele Lupi, Men’s Collections Visionary at Tod’s\n\nThe Guardian’s G2 Playlist\n\n“The Guardian’s G2 Playlist, from the Film & Music supplement. I was born in 1965, and grew up with punk rock and new wave. I still mostly listen to that kind of stuff, but I find this interesting – they recommend seven new tracks every week, and I keep the best ones on my iPhone playlist. Right now I’m listening to Paramore, a band from that list.”\n\nFee Greening, illustrator\n\nIn Defence of Witches by Mona Chollet\n\n“I read a lot of stuff on witches. In Defence of Witches by Mona Chollet was really great. And I loved Satanic Feminism by Per Faxneld. But for something lighter, I like rock biopics, mainly from the ’70s. I just read Glyn Johns’ Sound Man; he was an engineer on The Rolling Stones’s Exile on Main St and The Beatles’ Let It Be – all those heavy sounds of the ’70s.”\n\nPeggy Kuiper, painter\n\n“Gold” by Cleo Sol"
