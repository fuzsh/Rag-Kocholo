Always looking for the next big stunt!\n\nWarren Trezevant\n\nFilm Animator - Class of 1987\n\nWarren Trezevant is a Character Animator and Creative Lead for the 360 group at Pixar Animation Studios. Hired in 1995, Warren helped animate seven of Pixar’s feature films: A Bug’s Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars and Ratatouille. In addition to successfully bringing characters to life on the big screen, Warren expanded his role at Pixar by creating the ‘Toy Story Zoetrope,’ an updated version of an 18th century ‘illusion of movement’ device that pre-dates cinema and animation. The Toy Story Zoetrope premiered as part of the Pixar: 20 years of Animation exhibit, which opened at the New York Museum of Modern Art. By introducing Pixar to a new technology in the form of 3D printing, Warren took animation he created on the computer and printed each frame as a unique dimensional figurine. The Zoetrope gives the illusion that these figurines are springing to life right in front of your eyes. As part of the touring Pixar exhibit, the Zoetrope has been showcased in leading museums throughout the world in England, Japan, Scotland, Australia, Finland, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Mexico, and Oakland. Two additional Zoetropes were permanently installed at the Disney California Adventure theme park in California and Hong Kong Disneyland. Continuing the exploration of computer animation and dimensional figures, Warren helped animate the animatronic versions of Pixar's WALL-e and Luxo Jr. characters. Warren is currently working with the software teams at Pixar to help design and implement a renovation of their production software to improve the process of animating for feature films."
