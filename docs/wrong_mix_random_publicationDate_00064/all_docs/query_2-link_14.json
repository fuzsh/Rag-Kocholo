        "text": "Naguib Mahfouz, who became the first Arab writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, died at his home today. He was 94.\n\nMahfouz, whose novels depicted Egyptian life in his beloved corner of ancient Cairo, was admitted to the hospital just over a month ago after falling in his home and injuring his head. He died this morning after a sharp decline, according to Dr Hossam Mowafi, the head of a medical team that had been supervising his treatment.\n\nLong established as one of the Middle East's finest and best-loved writers, and an ardent advocate of moderation and religious tolerance, Mahfouz's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1988 brought him to international notice. But a wider readership came at a price: in 1994, an attacker inspired by a militant cleric's ruling that one of Mahfouz's novels was blasphemous stabbed the then-82-year-old writer as he left his Cairo home. The attack damaged the nerves leading to his right arm, effectively putting an end to his former practice of writing for hours in longhand.\n\nNevertheless, Mahfouz maintained a busy schedule well into his 90s. In his final years, he met with friends at Cairo's literary watering holes almost every evening while continuing to work during the day, dictating short stories, sometimes only a few paragraphs long, to a friend who would also read him the newspapers. His final major work, published in 2005, was a collection of stories about the afterlife, The Seventh Heaven. Speaking to the Associated Press at his 94th birthday celebration last December, Mahfouz explained that he wrote book \"because I want to believe something good will happen to me after death.\"\n\nOver the course of 50 novels, five plays and a score of short stories and essays, Mahfouz depicted life in Egypt, balanced between tradition and the modern world, with startling realism. The action of his novels was often confined to the 1,000-year-old Islamic quarter of Cairo where Mahfouz was born, a crowded neighbourhood of alleys and mosques which was the setting for his 1950s masterpiece, the Cairo Trilogy, which deals over the course of three books (Palace Walk, Palace of Desire and Sugar Street) with the fluctuating fortunes of a Muslim merchant family not unlike Mahfouz's own.\n\nIt was his 1959 novel, Children of Gebelawi, that mired him in the controversy that was to dog him for the rest of his life. An allegory of the lives of Islam's prophets, it was first serialized in Egyptian newspapers in 1959, when it caused an uproar similar to that created by Nikos Kazantzakis's The Last Temptation of Christ, which appeared a year later. Egyptian religious authorities banned it from being published as a book, but it was later released in Lebanon and subsequently translated into English.\n\nThe controversy resurfaced years later when Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie following the publication of The Satanic Verses in 1989. In a copycat move in the same year, the Egyptian radical sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman said Mahfouz deserved to die for Children of Gebelawi, a pronouncement that led directly to his stabbing five years later.\n\nIn the final decades of his life, Mahfouz became a fixture on the Cairo literary scene, and was most frequently to be found in the company of friends and colleagues at Nile-side cafes. His last novel, 1988's semi-autobiographical Qushtumar, centres on the lives of four elderly friends who meet weekly at a cafe that gives the book its title. Raymond Stock, Mahfouz's American biographer and translator, named Mahfouz's as \"a great son of Egypt, a patriot in the fullest sense of the word.\" But his relevance extends far beyond the boundaries of his native country. His work, according to Fatma Moussa, a renowned Egyptian critic and writer, \"has to do with the plight of humanity as a whole. He has presented it from the local angle, but it's not really local at all. It's kind of a microcosm of the whole world, a little image of the fate of man.\""
