There is no Nobel prize in mathematics. Why not? That question has created numerous stories, myths, and anecdotes. The most popular is that Nobel's wife had an affair with a mathematician, usually said to be Mittag-Leffler, and in revenge Nobel refused to endow one of his prizes in mathematics. Too bad for this story that Nobel was a life-long bachelor! The other common story is that Mittag-Leffler, the leading Swedish mathematician of Nobel's time, antagonized Nobel and so Nobel gave no prize in mathematics to prevent Mittag-Leffler from becoming a winner. This story is also suspect, however, because Nobel and Mittag-Leffler had almost no contact with each other. Most likely Nobel simply never gave any thought to including mathematics among his list of prize areas.\n\nReferences:\n\nGarding, Lars and Lars Hormander. \"Why is there no Nobel prize in mathematics?\" The Mathematical Intelligencer, 7(3)(1985), 73-74.\n\nRoss, Peter. \"Why Isn't there a Nobel Prize in Mathematics?\" Math Horizons, Vol. 3, No. 2 (November 1995), p9.

John Charles Fields (1863-1932), a Canadian mathematician, endowed funds in his will for an award for mathematical achievement and promise that would emphasize the international character of the mathematical endeavor. The first Fields Medal was awarded at the International Congress of Mathematics meeting in Oslo in 1936. Since 1950 the medal has been awarded every four years at the International Mathematical Congress to between 2 and 4 mathematicians. Although there is no specific age restriction in Fields' will, he did wish that the awards recognize both existing work and the promise of future achievement, so the medals have been restricted to mathematicians under the age of 40.\n\nWomen who have won a Fields Medal are:\n\n2014 Maryam Mirzakhani, Stanford University\n\n2022 Maryna Viazovska, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne\n\nReferences:\n\nIMU Awards | Fields Medal, [contains complete list of all winners of the Fields Medal and pictures of the front and back of the medal]\n\nHistorical Introduction by Alex Lopez-Ortiz, part of his FAQ site on mathematics.\n\nAbel Prize\n\nThe Abel Prize, established in 2002, recognizes contributions to the field of mathematics that are of extraordinary depth and influence. It is presented annually in Oslo and is administered by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters on behalf of the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.\n\nWomen who have won the Abel Prize are:\n\n2019 Karen Uhlenbeck, University of Texas at Austin [Additional Information]\n\nRuth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics\n\n[Description from the Notices of the American Mathematical Society]\n\nThe Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics was established in 1990 using funds donated to the American Mathematical Society by Joan S. Birman of Columbia University in memory of her sister, Ruth Lyttle Satter. Professor Satter earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and then joined the research staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories during World War II. After raising a family, she received a Ph.D. in botany at the age of forty-three from the University of Connecticut at Storrs, where she later became a faculty member. Her research on the biological clocks in plants earned her recognition in the U.S. and abroad. Professor Birman requested that the prize be established to honor her sister's commitment to research and to encouraging women in science. The prize is awarded every two years to recognize an outstanding contribution to mathematics research by a woman in the previous five years.

The purpose of this award is to recognize outstanding achievements in any area of mathematics education, to be interpreted in the broadest possible sense. While Louise Hay was widely recognized for her contributions to mathematical logic and for her strong leadership as head of the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, her devotion to students and her lifelong commitment to nurturing the talent of young women and men secure her reputation as a consummate educator. The annual presentation of this award is intended to highlight the importance of mathematical education and to evoke the memory of all that Hay exemplified as a teacher, scholar, administrator, and human being.\n\nThe winners have been:\n\n1991 Shirley Frye, National Council for Teachers of Mathematics\n\n1992 Olga Beaver, Williams College\n\n1993 Naomi Fisher, University of Illnois at Chicago\n\n1994 Kaye A. de Ruiz, U.S. Air Force\n\n1995 Etta Falconer, Spelman College [Biography]\n\n1996 Glenda T.
