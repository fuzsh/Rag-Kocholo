        "text": "Poetry\n\nFrom the series Snow Storm from a Moving Train, photographs by Mary Lou Reker\n\nPoets of the Eastern States\n\nThe Bee in the Center of a Zinnia: On the Poetry of Jody Stewart\n\nJody Stewart (née Pamela Stewart) is a poet whose work I have loved for going on forty years. From the very first collections, The St. Vlas Elegies (1977) and Cascades (1979), to the later, major collections, such as The Red Window (1997) and Ghost Farm (2010), I recognized her unique gift. Stewart is one of the finest lyric poets now writing in this country. The genre of “lyric” is almost indefinable, because lyric poems don’t always finish their stories (as narrative poems do) or tell us what to think (as didactic poems try to do). It is generally agreed, however, that one of the genre’s signature characteristics is at times mysterious but beautiful and/or haunting imagery, and that one reads the imagery in a lyric poem for what it “says,” but doesn’t translate. Stewart, for instance, takes on many issues of concern, such as domestic violence and serious illness, without lecturing us or holding forth. Another major characteristic of the lyric genre is that lyric poems often “sing.” They pay careful attention to the music of the words. Consider the following short passage from “From the Summer Porch,” and I think you’ll see what I mean:\n\nI see finches dip along the feeders\n\nor at basin’s edge. They know\n\nthe sounds a house makes\n\nor when thunder crawls the hills.\n\nBees, in golden thunder, sift through black-eyed Susans.\n\nAs a hawk’s shadow stains the clearing\n\njays, sparrows, cowbirds, doves\n\nspiral up through leaves.\n\nNote the long e’s, that assonance in this descriptive passage, which connects feeders-bees-leaves as a “sound-motif,” creating the tension as the hawk’s shadow “stains” the sky. Often, we expect a mournful undertone on the long o, and we do hear that running through know-golden-shadow, but those long o’s are interrupted by short vowel sounds, which helps to build the tension. The poem is pastoral, and thus the threat, when it arrives, is to an earthly paradise the poem glimpses “for one essential daily moment.” It is that moment the two poems by Stewart included here also celebrate.\n\nWhen I first met Stewart many years ago, she was a professor of Creative Writing at Arizona State University, accomplished, already confident in her voice, exceedingly modest—almost to a fault—and generous with her time. She still is. In those days, it was rare to be able to work with a woman poet, and we women in ASU’s creative writing program gathered ourselves around her, savoring the privilege. Stewart went on to teach at UC Irvine, University of Arizona, and University of Houston before receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1982, in order to research Arthurian legend in England. She didn’t return for some seven years, marrying a Cornwall native son and making a life in St. Ives, Cornwall. When she did return, she and her husband ran a working farm in Western Massachusetts, raising Angora goats and the occasional Icelandic sheep and llama. The working farm has now been retired, and Stewart has returned full force to writing and publishing, most recently, This Momentary World: Selected Poems (Nine Mile Books, 2022). In addition to a Guggenheim Fellowship, Stewart has been awarded fellowships from Hawthornden Castle, the Massachusetts Cultural Council, and the Elizabeth George Foundation.\n\nTo open a book by Jody Stewart is to enter another world—full of what David Wojahn has described recently as a “hard-won sense of wonder”—poems that are filled with Stewart’s “haunted and singular music.” There is to her poetry a crystalline elegance of syntax, a deceptive simplicity of diction, but also the meticulously observed details of the dailiness of life on a farm. The later poetry is full of a profound wisdom, perhaps drawn from working closely with animals and being a long-term cancer survivor. As she puts it in the author’s celebratory Foreword to This Momentary World, “I’m older now. Yay! I love being older; a bee in the center of a zinnia is a fine event.” That last observation is worthy of her “neighbor” from another century, Emily Dickinson, whose Homestead is just down the road from Stewart’s retired farm in Hawley. I think of Stewart as having the tonal equivalent in her poetry of a musician’s perfect pitch. Her imagery is astonishingly beautiful, and her poetic ear is dazzling. Personally, I marvel at her poems, learn from their technique, return to ponder their insights. I hope you’ll follow up this brief introduction by acquiring her latest collection, but for now, please savor the marvelously varied Eastern States Poetry that Jody Stewart has curated for our winter issue of Persimmon Tree.\n\nPoets and Courage: Poetry from the Eastern United States\n\nWhen I was first teaching, I would tell students that “poetry has a spiritual life of its own” and, while I wasn’t sure what I meant, I knew I believed it and still do. Spirit/breath—what we breathe in and then return to the air—perhaps to touch, speak, sing, or share. How could one know where such forces might land. So many poems were submitted for this December issue, and, alas, I could only choose 15. Yet I would have loved to take a poem from each person who kindly submitted; what an anthology that would have been!\n\nTo read so many poems was both intriguing and moving. You poets all held so much in common: family love (grandkids!), grief, caregiving, personal trauma deflected through poetry, the physical self, political anguish, the natural world with its joys and damages, and works of real humor—all of which I would have enjoyed including. I felt I was listening to everyone have quite wonderful conversations with each other. And the clearly shared thread amongst all the voices? Courage! Lots of it.\n\nAs reasonably “mature” women we have all been through major difficulties, and there is much we recognize in each other. The more poems shared, the better we may come to understand one another. Lately, we may be aware of, and discouraged by, truly scary stuff. It takes courage to step up day by day, and courage to write of it, to speak out. Yet you all do! Brava! Poetry’s spiritual force insists on it.\n\nFrom the series Snow Storm from a Moving Train, photographs by Mary Lou Reker\n\nMadwoman in the Office\n\nIn the days of the Smith-Corona\n\nI worked in an office\n\nwhere our only debate was\n\nelite versus pica, font sizes,\n\nnot class struggle\n\nor the desire to eat chalk—\n\nthose ideas may have been interesting.\n\nBut no. If we discussed anything,\n\nit was who should empty the trash\n\nat clock-out. As for the news of the day,\n\nwe might have spoken of the war\n\nnearly over or Nixon nearly gone\n\nbut we didn’t even have a water cooler\n\nto gossip around.\n\nAll I wanted to do\n\nbesides shoot myself\n\nwas make a run to the office supply store\n\nto replenish the White Out I had used up.\n\nAgain.\n\nThe thrum of adding machines\n\nthe ugly smudge of carbon paper\n\nthe phlegmy cough of the bookkeeper\n\nwho paced the hall, banner of Pall Mall\n\nsmoke unfurling behind him\n\nwaiting his turn for the one-toilet\n\nwashroom made me run for hills\n\nthat did not exist anywhere\n\nnear the New Jersey asphalt\n\nroad I was stuck on.\n\nThe poet Theodore Roethke\n\nsaved me when he whispered\n\nsomething from behind the steel gray\n\nfiling cabinets, something about\n\nmanila folders he had known,\n\nsomething about their inexorable misery,\n\nand right then I decided\n\nto set them on fire.\n\nIn Weather Like This\n\nIn weather like this\n\ncattle bunch up\n\nlike stars\n\non one side\n\nof a restless sky\n\nnostrils flared\n\nleaning into each other\n\nchins against backs\n\nlightning striking\n\nlike missiles\n\nthe wind’s grenades\n\na crazed moon\n\nlet out of the madhouse\n\nriding\n\nin and out of the clouds\n\none night too many\n\nto share the sky\n\nwith stars\n\nhuddled together like cattle\n\nthe storm has caught\n\nin a corner of field\n\npoints of light\n\nblown out\n\nand out\n\nand out\n\nthe moon\n\nstriking them dead where they shone\n\nBroken Nest\n\nA week after Hurricane Ian swept\n\naway the roof\n\nthe outdoor chairs and table\n\nthe mangled umbrella wind-forced\n\naround a sheaf of palm fronds\n\nsand and drowned geckos\n\nmildewed rugs and mud-footed bookcases\n\nmy small corner of paradise\n\nnot lost\n\nbut badly bruised\n\ntossed and spun\n\nas it was\n\nfor six relentless hours\n\nand yet\n\nand yet\n\none corner cushion on\n\nmy white couch survived\n\nmiraculously undamaged\n\nand some small bird\n\nis flying backlit spirals\n\nagainst the turquoise sky—\n\nhow will she know\n\nwithout a map of this broken\n\nlandscape where she built\n\ndays or weeks ago?\n\nhow will she find the one\n\nunviolated corner of this world\n\nthat matches the nest in her bones?\n\nEnd Notes:\n\n1. Ian, the fifth-strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the U.S., was a Category 4 monster when it clobbered Southwest Florida on September 28, 2022. Ian tied Hurricane Charlie, 2004, as the fourth-most-powerful storm ever to hit Florida. (Internet news source, 2023)\n\n2. Hurricane Ian was predicted to make landfall near Tampa, which spent days preparing for severe storm conditions, but actually entered Florida further south near Ft. Myers, which was unprepared for the event.\n\nFrom the series Snow Storm from a Moving Train, photographs by Mary Lou Reker\n\nShhhhh\n\nOnce I was a baby head\n\na Liddle Kiddle vinyl head\n\nuntil a big head filled my head\n\nand my head was too small\n\nThe big head said do this not that\n\nI did my best to do or not\n\nI drank my milk and wore my socks\n\nto pacify its no\n\nIts list was long\n\nlike spiders’ legs\n\nI acquiesced when I could\n\nIts melodies of praise were bright and beautiful\n\nIn private, the head loved my head\n\nIt complemented all of me\n\nBut when we were with others\n\nit turned away\n\nI learned to think the way it thought\n\nto measure love and privacy\n\nto know its preference (atta girl!)\n\nsecretly\n\nWhatever big head asked of me\n\nI gave\n\nIts gaze was gravity\n\nI flowered in its garden\n\nAppeasement grew into my skull\n\nMy skull was big with happiness\n\nI grew into an unmade bed\n\nThe world was glorious\n\nOne day big head said here not there\n\nI couldn’t fit my arms inside\n\na sweater or my skin\n\nI had grown out of them\n\nNothing righted what was wrong\n\nI’d grown\n\nMy handsprings, habits failed, devotion failed\n\nSoon I dissolved\n\nExcept my Liddle Kiddle head\n\nwhich surfaced, indestructible\n\non landfills, shorelines, windowsills\n\nanonymous\n\nRefugee\n\nIn the late 19th century Baron and Baroness de Hirsch bought land in Argentina to serve as communes for Jews fleeing pogroms.\n\nLocusts and drought plague the new land.

Nothing\n\nto my need.\n\nTwo Black Geldings\n\nThe two black geldings know\n\nwhat I cannot know.\n\nWhat I know\n\nis one will leave.\n\nWhen I call them in, they gallop together\n\nout of darkness,\n\nthemselves darkness,\n\nand I cannot tell one from the other\n\nuntil they storm the barn, puffing and steaming,\n\none with a half-moon on his forehead,\n\nthe other, a star.\n\nThey have many acres to graze\n\nbut they are always in step,\n\ntheir alertness tuned\n\nto the same suddenness.\n\nThey pay attention to everything\n\nand to nothing.\n\nI lead them in, I lead them out. I feed them.\n\nI do not know them.\n\nAnd when the one left behind\n\nlooks across the field, down the road\n\nwhere the other has been taken\n\nhe whinnies the softest sound\n\nI have ever heard.\n\nFrom the series Snow Storm from a Moving Train, photographs by Mary Lou Reker\n\nLove Letters to the Wild\n\nYes, I did weep. Yes\n\nwe painted the walls of our living\n\nroom with a smoldering red, like the urge\n\nto shatter the sheetrock. The crumpled\n\npapers, wood stove creaking\n\nfrom its effort of holding in\n\nso much heat.\n\nWe lived inside that firewall\n\nfor a long time, it was\n\nour little box with a crank you could wind up and we\n\nwould open our mouths and sing —the nightingale boy and I.\n\nSang where no one could hear, until\n\nutterly heartsick we threw open the doors and\n\nwent outside in the ferns and learned\n\nto love each other.\n\nOr if I went out alone it was\n\nto the street with catalpa trees and long\n\ncatkins of cottonwoods. It is possible\n\nto walk down the centerline in moonlight\n\nwhen all has quieted and the neighbors’ lights\n\nhave gone out, utterly lost\n\nin the dark crosshatches of branches.\n\nOnce the shadow of a pothole proved\n\nto be a porcupine, gathering its coat of shards\n\nand shuffling away.\n\nMy hands are pearlskin. My feet\n\ngrow hair and claws inside their slippers.\n\nYes, I tell you,\n\nI am out here —\n\nStill Life With Pear\n\nYou are painting a picture. Someone might ask of what, and you would lie. You would tell a lie and say, a still life, a still life with pear and vase. But really, you are painting the aftermath. Your canvas is stretched over a memory made vivid. You remember with every window view and mirror reflection, even opening a closet door, seeing the clothes you didn’t wear that day. You sketch the one room house, the filmy smoke that rose to the ceiling, smoke that became fog, turning the air hazy grey. He knew how to use smoke and fog and haze, to obscure, disguise, capture. He fed his purpose to you. Your head was not yours; you could see and not see. What you saw was him warming his bare feet in you. This is the ugliness that is in your pocket, disgust amid coins. You penciled in the secret, erased it, drew it again. You caulked the crack in the plaster of what he did to you. The painting is you at 15, not the lie, not the overripe pear and the empty vase. The pear on the table softens, begins to spoil. Fruit flies stir the air above it. You spread the blanket of your painting over the rotting pear. You try to cover it, but still it shows through. Like a fish under pond ice, the shadow swims beneath the paint. You layer on thick slabs of color but there it is, just below the surface, the persistent image, the ghost pear, the still life.\n\nPaula Modersohn-Becker: Six Paintings\n\n1.\n\nSleeping center of a quilt,\n\nshe curls like a grub\n\nor the dark, dirt-encased cocoon\n\nof a squash-borer rooted\n\nin an inch of soil, studying\n\nto molt.\n\n2.\n\nEarthenware belly,\n\nheaped stone fruits,\n\nlabial fold in the spread cloth––\n\nearth as a table, a wall of seeds.\n\n3.\n\nShe bears the weight of her fertility\n\nwithout the myth.\n\nHer round flesh is a fact\n\nno less than the curving birch.\n\n4.\n\nThe dark dress takes hold––\n\na root thrust from deeper dark.\n\nLids closed, blood mouth closed,\n\nher face blooms on a short stem.\n\nThe flower in her hand will last the day.\n\n5.\n\nAgainst clouds’ truthful glare\n\nour flesh is wood.\n\n6.\n\nEyes lift, cardboard to mirror:\n\nportrait of the maker, drawing.\n\nHer chalked half-smile\n\nsees what we are. We who were living,\n\nwe who are still to come . . .\n\nThe Structure of Milk\n\nI live in fear of milk gone bad,\n\npour jugs of it down the drain\n\ndays before the little inky date\n\ncondemns it to sour. The gallon\n\nin my refrigerator dies on my birthday,\n\nwhich I share with Yoko Ono, John\n\nTravolta, Toni Morrison. My husband\n\nsays bad milk turns to cheese, which\n\nI love, and him too, still, even now.\n\nAll the diets my mother followed\n\nhad her drink milk so skim, it was\n\nblue, a light deified breast-milk\n\nblue. I was born on the last\n\nday of Aquarius. I once wore a gold\n\ncharm around my neck that fell\n\nto my breastbone: a woman\n\nholding a jug high over her head,\n\npouring fake diamonds that shone.\n\nHer tiny metal arms could just bear\n\nthe weight of those glass chips filled\n\nto the lip. When we cleaned out\n\nmy parents’ home—after—we found\n\npackets of powdered milk unopened\n\nin a cabinet behind the quick oatmeal,\n\ntins of tea, a jar of instant coffee.\n\nFood to take to the moon. Stale food,\n\nyes, but not turned, not bad. Remnants\n\nof a Depression girlhood. Today,\n\nnearing the end of Aquarius, I’m warned\n\nnot to delay, not to skip a step or a rehearsal.\n\nTry to draw a diagram, my horoscope says.\n\nDon’t wait until the very last minute.\n\nFrom the series Snow Storm from a Moving Train, photographs by Mary Lou Reker\n\nBreast Cancer, 5 Years After\n\nI thought my dance with death would begin with a bow,\n\nformal steps to fine music (under a candelabra of radiation)\n\ndeath’s long arm looped around my shoulder\n\na little too confiding, a little too intimate,\n\nthe smirk under his mask a little too knowing.\n\nOne of those guys I remember from high school.\n\nYet death was not close, and not he: Instead,\n\nI saw her later, in the woods. She growled,\n\nher long feet clawed. She rolled and twisted\n\nran up the steep ridge trail, paused,\n\nlifted a lip and bared a tooth\n\n(are you sweet, should I test you)—she stared,\n\na mother in her element. I whispered,\n\nGo home. I have earned myself\n\nanother afternoon to walk this place.\n\nChildren’s Literature\n\nA white triangle, a ceiling by night\n\nbisected and disturbed. But the child\n\nat the breakfast table, his slow\n\nfeet dragging the air between wooden chair and floor,\n\nspoons up his gooey, yellow egg.\n\nThe white ceiling is as far away as Papa’s bookshelf,\n\nor that lion in his picture book hunched\n\nby a pool in a sun-struck enclosure.\n\nSo exposed the lion must curl into himself\n\nthough his dusty eyes stay open\n\nno matter the streaked white of sky.\n\nWith the tip of a spoon, the boy\n\ntraces the bright yolk diagonally across his plate\n\nwhich is the color of chalk. But the sky\n\nabove the tired lion burns\n\nalong the electrified fence line.\n\nThe lion knows it’s a school day,\n\nall shoe laces and geometry.\n\nHe reaches his paws into the tepid pool\n\neven as it’s shrinking. Good Morning, Mr. Lion\n\nsays the boy, eager with his tendril of tongue.\n\nThe Girl with Nothing to Say\n\nhas a bitter mouth and heavy salt on her tongue.\n\nSo burdened she can’t even find a first word,\n\nshe steps softly out of the house.\n\nBeyond, green-ladened lust crouches.\n\nThe girl bends low, slipping across grass\n\nonto the hot road. There is nowhere to go\n\neven as she walks father and farther\n\nfrom her closed front door. Behind her,\n\ncrows screech a hawk away from their nest.\n\nThis girl feels how each step is the small glow\n\nof a blister. At first saliva fills her mouth\n\nso she can spit, but then it thins.\n\nStill, she lifts one foot then another\n\nuntil she knows that thirst is her only future.\n\nLeaving Tristan de Cunha\n\nby Margaret Joan Swanson\n\nTristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean is the most remote inhabited island in the world. Henry, Lizzy, and Starchy are among the many children of Tristan da Cunha who lose their fathers to the sea in 1885. Their friendship endures over eighty years on an island that is both an egalitarian utopia and an unrelenting challenge to its people. Based on the history of the island – documented by missionaries, whalers, explorers, shipwrecked travelers, and the islanders themselves – Leaving Tristan da Cunha follows the trio’s fortunes as ships come and go, providing their only connection to the “h’outside warld.” When the 1961 eruption of Tristan’s volcano forces the evacuation of the islanders to England, they are determined to return as soon as the ashes cool. But the Colonial Office stands in the way. This is the story of the love the people of Tristan have for their “hi-land” and of their determination to live out their lives there – on the narrow green apron of the volcano – in spite of being relentlessly urged by authorities to abandon Tristan to its rightful inhabitants: “the wild birds of the ocean.” Margaret is a retired community planner. Her story Two Goddesses and a Child: An imagined incident on ancient Crete appeared in the Fall 2023 of Persimmon Tree.
