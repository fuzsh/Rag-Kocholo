        "text": "While pundits ponder the intricacies of polling data in the U.S. presidential election, we asked our readers to complete ballots of a different kind, measuring the best of the best in Arkansas, from dance clubs to dry cleaners to dermatologists. You chimed in with gusto on your favorite milkshakes and massage therapists, cemented Sen. Tom Cotton’s status as a perennial contender in our “Worst Arkansan” category and name-dropped your most trusted health care providers in the Little Rock area.\n\nTo dig deeper into the zeitgeist that produced this year’s poll results, Arkansas Times food editor Rhett Brinkley traced the trajectory of botox’s popularity in the state from ill-advised party trick to widely adopted self-care protocol in a clinical setting, erasing the ravages of time and sun exposure — including those pesky frown lines between your eyebrows. Then, Brinkley crossed time zones to interview Landis Wayne Shook, a Natural State native who took up residency in Taiwan and decided to open an Arkansas-inspired diner in Kaohsiung City, where you’ll find Southern-style biscuits and gravy that one diner deemed “too filling.” Times contributor Tara Escolin sat down with Zina Al-Shukri, a Little Rock-based, Baghdad-born portrait artist whose work as an art therapist reaches inmates incarcerated at the Pulaski County Jail. Editorial director Stephanie Smittle sang the praises of TikTok star Craig “Big Chef” Taylor’s oxtail special at It’s Time to Eat, a soul food restaurant that adjoins the nondenominational church Taylor pastors in North Little Rock. Our culture editor, Daniel Grear, peeked into the crawlspaces of Central Arkansas with McCrory native Eric Young of Blackbird Home Inspections — a business that our readers have named a trustworthy favorite year after year. Arkansas Times summer intern Milo Strain peeled back the innards of custom guitars with boutique luthier Dave Fry of Fry Guitars, who’s been making dreamy custom axes for Central Arkansas’s pickers since 2010, while staff photographer Brian Chilson captured the ink at longtime reader favorite 7th Street Tattoo.\n\nRead those stories at the links above, and read on for a full list of the winners and finalists in our annual readers poll.\n\nRecreation\n\nBike trail\n\nWinner: Arkansas River Trail\n\nFinalists: Pinnacle Mountain State Park Monument Trails (Roland), Razorback Greenway (Northwest Arkansas), Northwoods Trail (Hot Springs), Coler Mountain Bike Preserve (Bentonville)\n\nCheap date\n\nWinner: Pinnacle Mountain State Park\n\nFinalists: The Old Mill (North Little Rock), Big Dam Bridge, Riverfront Park, Rock Town River Outfitters\n\nFamily attraction\n\nWinner: Little Rock Zoo\n\nFinalists: Museum of Discovery, Magic Springs Theme and Water Park (Hot Springs), Topgolf, Main Event Little Rock\n\nGolf course\n\nWinner: Burns Park Golf Course (North Little Rock)\n\nFinalists: Rebsamen Golf Course, Chenal Country Club, Pleasant Valley Country Club, Red Apple Inn & Country Club (Heber Springs)\n\nGym/place to work out\n\nWinner: Little Rock Athletic Club\n\nFinalists: Blue Yoga Nyla, Jolly Bodies, Omnis CrossFit, Rock City Complete Fitness\n\nHiking trail\n\nWinner: Pinnacle Mountain State Park (Roland)\n\nFinalists: Emerald Park (North Little Rock), Rattlesnake Ridge Natural Area (Roland), Ozark Highlands Trail, Lake Atalanta (Rogers)\n\nMarina\n\nWinner: Mountain Harbor Marina on Lake Ouachita (Mount Ida)\n\nFinalists: Eden Isle Marina on Greers Ferry Lake (Heber Springs), Brady Mountain Resort & Marina on Lake Ouachita (Royal), Fairfield Bay Marina (Shirley), Rock City Yacht Club\n\nOutdoor attraction\n\nWinner: Buffalo National River\n\nFinalists: Garvan Woodland Gardens (Hot Springs), Petit Jean State Park (Morrilton), Pinnacle Mountain State Park (Roland), Big Dam Bridge\n\nPark\n\nWinner: Petit Jean State Park (Morrilton)\n\nFinalists: Two Rivers Park, Pinnacle Mountain State Park (Roland), Murray Park, Wilson Park (Fayetteville)\n\nPlace to canoe/kayak/tube\n\nWinner: Buffalo National River\n\nFinalists: Ouachita River, Caddo River, Mulberry River, Saline River\n\nPlace to mountain bike\n\nWinner: Pinnacle Mountain State Park Monument Trails\n\nFinalists: Mt.
