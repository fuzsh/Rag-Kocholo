Volunteers sought to read Nobel Prize-winning works Feb. 18

4:15 p.m., Dec. 12, 2003--University of Delaware faculty, students and staff are invited to participate in reading from the works of J.M. Coetzee, the winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature, on Wednesday, Feb. 18.

Sponsored by the English department, the reading will take place from 12:20-1:10 p.m., in 122 Memorial Hall. A discussion period will follow and refreshments will be served.

Coetzee gained international recognition for his 1980 novel Waiting for the Barbarians and was awarded the 1983 Booker Prize in the United Kingdom for Life and Times of Michael K.

His 1999 novel, Disgrace, made him the first author to receive a second Booker Prize. An examination of the values and conduct resulting from South Africas apartheid system, which, according to Coetzee, could arise anywhere, functions as a fundamental theme in his novels.

Individuals interested in participating in the reading should contact Linda Russell at [lrussell@udel.edu] or Lois Potter at [lpotter@udel.edu]. Participants also should indicate whether they are interested in reading a certain passage or would prefer to read from a prearranged selection of texts.

For more information, call 831-1974.
