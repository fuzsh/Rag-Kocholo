        "text": "Harpoon is a Main Story Quest (Operation) in Far Cry 6. This walkthrough will guide you through all objectives of the Harpoon main mission.\n\nRegion: El Este\n\nSub-Region: Conuco\n\nQuest Giver: Yelena Morales\n\nRequirement: Complete Operations “Knuckleball“, “National Treasure” and “Room Service”\n\nReward: 300 Guerrilla XP, 1944 Petrov HS-100 “Karlito” (Vehicle)\n\nMission Info: It’s time to take down Admiral Benitez at her main base of operations. La Moral and some of the old guerrillas will rendezvous at Lopez Tower Ruin and launch an attack. Find Benitez. Kill her.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTalk to El Tigre to launch the attack\n\nEscort Karlito the tank\n\nFind Admiral Benitez\n\nAssassinate Admiral Benitez\n\nDefend Yelena while she hacks the cannons\n\nDestroy Benitez’s office door\n\nKill Admiral Benitez\n\nStarting Location: Harpoon\n\nHarpoon is an operation available at the La Moral base in Conuco, El Este after completing “Knuckleball“, “National Treasure” and “Room Service“. It can be started by talking to Yelena Morales.\n\nTalk to El Tigre to launch the attack\n\nHead to the mission marker by Toledo Bay to meet up with El Tigre.\n\nEscort Karlito the tank\n\nYou will now need to escort the tank into Benitez’s base. There will be enemies trying to destroy it with RPGs, so focus on them when escorting it. If the health on Karlito gets too low, you will need to repair it with your repair tool before you can move on. After breaking through the second gate you will get a cutscene and end up inside.\n\nFind Admiral Benitez\n\nOnce you’re inside the building, you will be locked in a room with two electronic doors. You will need to wait for enemies to come through these doors so that you can move through them.\n\nIn the next room, deal with the enemies and head downstairs, at which point the enemy behind the glass will turn on poison in your room. You will need to turn 4 valves to turn off the poison. The first is on the wall downstairs in the open, and the second is on the pipes above which can be reached from the second floor.\n\nFrom the second valve, the third is to your right and up a ladder, while the last one is just passed that through a broken fence.\n\nOnce all four valves have been turned, Sgt. Cardenas will come out from the locked room to fight you. Kill him (your Tostador flamethrower will kill him very quickly) then pick up his keycard to enter his locked room. Inside there you will find another keycard to the room downstairs.\n\nInside the prison, head into the control room where Benitez was located and open the cells. Some enemies will come in after this, including Sgt. Minaya. Kill him to grab his keycard. Continue forward to the rooftop.\n\nAssassinate Admiral Benitez\n\nOn the rooftop, Benitez will be holed up in her office and there’ll be plenty of enemies. Kill the enemies and work your way up the stairs to the entrance of her office. It’ll be blocked by a gate, so you will need another way in.\n\nDefend Yelena while she hacks the cannons\n\nYelena will start hacking the cannons to blast open the gate. During this you will need to defend both Yelena and the cannons. Hop in the available cannon and use it to shoot at the enemies that start to flood the area. If the cannon gets badly damaged, you can hop out and repair it with your repair tool.\n\nDestroy Benitez’s office door\n\nOnce Yelena has finished hacking the cannons, shoot the gate in front of Benitez’s office.\n\nKill Admiral Benitez\n\nWith her office now accessible, head inside. You will get a slow-mo when you enter and Benitez will have a hostage, so make sure to aim and shoot her.\n\nThis finishes Harpoon operation in Far Cry 6."
