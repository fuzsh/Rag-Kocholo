        "text": "Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Diseases\n\nMendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMDs) is a rare congenital syndrome, which was first reported in 1964 in families with cases of disseminated atypical mycobacteriosis (Engbaek 1964). The condition is defined as a disease with severe clinical features, disseminated or recurrent infection by environmental mycobacteria, and, in some cases, a severe co-infection with Salmonella non-typhi. Salmonella infection in the absence of co-infection with mycobacteria has also been reported (Casanova and Abel 2002).\n\nSince the first cases reported were of patients who presented infection with BCG or environmental mycobacteria, the condition was named MSMD (Picard and others 2006). However, this name is rather misleading, because there are cases with no mycobacterial infection. Instead, other types of intracellular pathogens (eg, Nocardia and Paracoccidioidomyces) have been reported (Zerbe and Holland 2005). Therefore, the name “inborn defects of the IL-12/IFN-γ axis” seems more appropriate (Al-Muhsen and Casanova 2008)."
