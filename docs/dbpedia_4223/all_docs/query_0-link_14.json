George\n\nON 26 JUNE 1942, against a backdrop of warships with elevated guns, two columns of sailors massed on a quay on the Neapolitan waterfront and witnessed Benito Mussolini, Italy’s premier and supreme military leader, and Admiral Arturo Riccardi, the Regia Marina’s chief of staff, present medals to the officers and men of the fleet’s 7th Division. The ceremony marked a battle fought two years and five days after Italy’s entry into World War II. The British Royal Navy had tried to pass large convoys from Gibraltar and Egypt to the island bastion of Malta in the central Mediterranean. Air strikes and Italian battleships repulsed the eastern convoy. The 7th Division intercepted the western group and applied, in Mussolini’s words, the sharp teeth of the Roman Wolf into the flesh of Great Britain.¹\n\nThe campaign fought in the Mediterranean and North Africa from June 1940 to September 1943, principally between the armed forces of Great Britain and its empire and the Kingdom of Italy, with strong assistance from Germany, has inspired study and passion. A central perception in the English understanding of this campaign is that British air and naval forces operating from Malta choked the Axis sea-lanes and denied German General Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox, the supplies he needed to overrun the Middle East and that this justified the heavy cost of maintaining Malta as a base. In fact, for much of the war the island’s impact on Axis traffic to Africa was minimal. By mid-1942 Italian and German forces had Malta tightly blockaded by sea and bombarded by air, and the British chiefs of staff believed that its supplies would be exhausted by July.\n\nIn June 1942, in an effort to relieve Malta and restore its offensive capacity, the Royal Navy borrowed heavily from the Home and Eastern Fleets to reinforce its flotillas at Gibraltar and Alexandria—despite other threats such as Germany’s Atlantic submarine offensive, a German fleet in Norway interdicting the convoy route to Murmansk, and Japanese carriers that had recently defeated British forces in the Indian Ocean. Great Britain used this borrowed strength to escort strong convoys from Gibraltar and Egypt for beleaguered Malta. In a complex aero-naval battle lasting nearly a week, Axis forces defeated Operation Vigorous, the larger eastern effort, and eliminated two-thirds of the western convoy, Operation Harpoon. Seventeen merchant ships set out, but only two reached Malta, and one of those was damaged. The defeat of the mid-June convoys forced the British to immediately organize a repeat operation while their global position continued to deteriorate.\n\nAn author recently noted that Harpoon has been called the ‘forgotten convoy,’ but a better name might be ‘disowned convoy.’ The official British history, following a terse summary of the two convoys, commented, The enemy’s success was undeniable. One British historian titled his chapter on Operation Vigorous An imperial balls-up. Another tried to paint Harpoon as a success: the 15,000 tons discharged was little short of munificence to a population faced with starvation or capitulation. Winston Churchill, in his six-volume history of the Second World War, completely ignored the June 1942 convoys after spending a chapter detailing Malta’s peril in March, April, and May, 1942.²\n\nThe Harpoon and Vigorous convoys of mid-June 1942 are the subjects of this work. The conduct of these operations and the Axis response are examined in great detail because the records contain ambiguities and even distortions that justify close scrutiny. This work relies heavily on reports filed during and shortly after events by the Italian and British units and commands involved. It strives to follow the facts and maintain a dispassionate point of view.\n\nThe mid-June battle illustrates the Mediterranean balance of power after two years of intense combat. Its operational aspects demonstrate the complex relationship between air and naval power and geography’s impact on littoral operations. Harpoon/Vigorous also shows how the prime minister and War Cabinet mortgaged the British Empire’s worldwide interests to maintain a position in the Mediterranean; especially interesting are the strategic hopes London pinned on this operation. The convoys were part of a gamble that could, if the dice fell right, help conclude the Mediterranean campaign victoriously and strengthen the British Empire’s hand in setting Allied grand strategy.\n\nThe mid-June operation also presented an interesting conundrum for the German and Italian leadership. They agreed that the capture of Suez was a worthwhile objective but not what to do about Malta. Mussolini, Comando Supremo’s chief of staff, Field Marshal Ugo Cavallero, Admiral Riccardi, and Vice Admiral Eberhard Weichold, head of the German naval command in Italy, considered Malta’s capture absolutely necessary for victory in North Africa. Others, including Rommel; General Alfred Jodl, chief of the Wehrmacht operations staff; and, most importantly, German chancellor Adolf Hitler, believed that the risks of assaulting the island outweighed the benefits and lacked faith in Italian ability to conduct the invasion.\n\nMalta dominated Mediterranean operations in many respects. As a British bastion directly athwart the Italian sea-lane between the peninsula and Africa, it had great potential to impede Axis traffic. However, maintaining Malta was an expensive and dangerous task, and historians have from the first debated the merits of the Imperial policy of holding the island at all costs. Along with the question of Malta there is the larger matter of Great Britain’s and Italy’s whole strategic focus. Did Great Britain need to undertake an offensive war in the Mediterranean? What did London sacrifice in the process, and what did it gain? Did Italy need to conduct a campaign in North Africa? How did this campaign serve its vital interests? Believing that context is required for an appreciation of the specific operations that are the subject of this study, these pages include a summary of the Mediterranean war with an emphasis on Malta and the campaign against traffic to the island and to Africa.\n\nThis work observes certain conventions. During the Second World War, Italy and Germany employed the metric system of measurement while the Anglo-Americans used the imperial system. Rather than convert yards to meters or kilometers to miles, this study uses the imperial system except when quoting or discussing Axis actions or vessels when the metric system may be used. In a few instances the two values are given side by side. Miles always refers to nautical miles unless otherwise stated. Foreign ranks are translated into English. A table of equivalent ranks appears in the appendix. The appendix also contains a list of abbreviations and conversions. Times present a complication as during the mid-June convoys the British used double summer time and their accounts are one hour later than the times cited in Italian reports. For consistency, British times are used in Chapters 5, 6, and 7. Subtract one hour to reconcile with Italian times. Quotations from the Italian have been translated by the author.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nONE OF THE JOYS OF WRITING is to experience the generosity of authors and enthusiasts who are passionate about naval history, and it is a pleasure to acknowledge here the contributions of family, old friends, and new friends who have contributed to this work.\n\nI would like to thank my friend Enrico Cernuschi, who provided crucial material from the Italian archives and, as always, helped in many other ways.

These fast and valuable vessels carried eleven thousand troops bound for Egypt to bring British formations stationed there up to strength. They formed into convoy WS1 escorted by the heavy cruiser Cumberland and, for the first stage, four destroyers. The convoy arrived at Freetown, West Africa, on 8 July and Cape Town, South Africa, eight days later. From there WS1 crossed the Indian Ocean, picking up a second escort, the heavy cruiser Kent. Because the Admiralty considered the ships too valuable to expose them to Italian attack in the Red Sea, they docked at Trincomalee, Ceylon, on 29 July, and the men disembarked. The troops sailed up the Indian coast to Bombay. At Bombay they transferred to eight transports that formed a part of Convoy BN3: twenty merchant ships and eight escorts, including a light cruiser and two destroyers. BN3 departed Bombay on 10 August and arrived at Suez on 23 August.\n\nGREAT BRITAIN’S STRATEGIC GOALS\n\nGreat Britain committed these troops to a journey of nearly two months at a time when England faced a German invasion. The voyage was so long because Italy had declared war against Great Britain on 10 June 1940. This declaration severed the sea-route from Gibraltar to Suez. The official British history of the war at sea summarized the impact. The distance round the Cape from the Clyde to Suez . . . is 12,860 [statute] miles. For a convoy to reach the Middle East theater and return to Britain by this route necessitated a journey some 20,000 miles longer than the round voyage using the Mediterranean. Not only were the time and the distance inflated but the convoys required escorts and special shipping such as liners and fast cargo vessels. If one convoy of about twenty-five ships sailed each month, the new requirement meant that about 150 of our best merchant ships were kept permanently on this service. Adding 8,700 nautical miles (thirty days at twelve knots) to each voyage to Suez was hardly the only problem: the one-way journey to India went from 6,200 to 10,600 miles, and the nearest Australian port became 1,500 miles farther away. Ships carrying troops and supplies to Suez generally had to detour to find cargos for the return trip, further reducing their efficiency and adding to the strain on shipping.¹\n\nGreat Britain faced hard choices after France’s unexpected collapse. The first was whether to continue fighting or accept a German-dominated Europe. The new government led by Winston S. Churchill mustered popular support, overcame dissent from within its own ranks, and resolved to fight.² This decision had global ramifications because, as in 1778 and 1803, the conflict pitted a world empire against a continental coalition. The British Empire’s power resided in a resource-rich network spread throughout Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Empire of India, and the colonies and mandates of Africa, South East Asia, the Americas, and the Middle East. Possession of strategic points such as Suez, Gibraltar, Cape Town, Aden, and Singapore allowed Great Britain to control the world’s oceanic trade and choke an enemy nation’s maritime traffic.\n\nMerchant shipping unified Britain’s empire. Sea power kept the ships sailing or, in the case of enemies, confined them to port. The Broadway of the empire’s pre-war sea-lanes was the Mediterranean—a vital shortcut to the lands east of Suez. Italy’s entry into the war, however, immediately transformed the Mediterranean from a thoroughfare into a dead end.\n\nMalta had been the Royal Navy’s main Mediterranean base since 1800; it lay astride Italy’s sea-route to Tripoli, Libya’s capital and major port. However, the neglect of Malta’s defenses in the decades leading up to war and the proximity of Italian air power—the potency of which the Royal Air Force greatly exaggerated in the hope that, by so doing, a greater share of the service budget would be committed to the air force—caused the fleet to abandon the island by April 1939 for the much less suitable and logistically undeveloped Egyptian harbor of Alexandria.³\n\nBy the summer of 1940 Malta was an isolated outpost in the midst of a hostile sea. Indeed, the Admiralty even recommended withdrawing the Mediterranean Fleet from Alexandria because our Atlantic trade must be the first consideration.⁴ The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General John Dill, recognizing that the Far East was of much greater economic value to Great Britain than the Middle East, recommended reinforcing the Far East first against potential Japanese aggression. The other members of the Chiefs of Staff Committee likewise questioned the wisdom of centering Great Britain’s war effort on the Middle East. However, keeping a weather eye on a more hopeful future, Churchill and the War Cabinet decided to contest the Mediterranean and reinforce Malta.\n\nA War Cabinet assessment of September 1940 gave the reasons. Malta should be held. If it could be made secure enough for use as a fleet base we should derive the great advantage of being able to hold the Italians in check with one fleet instead of the two now required (one at each end of the Mediterranean). We should also be able to interrupt Italian communications with Libya much more effectively. From it we could ultimately strike at Italy . . . The War Cabinet’s September assessment summarized: The elimination of Italy and the consequent removal of the threat to our control of the Eastern Mediterranean would be a strategic success of the first importance. Italy’s power of resistance is much less than that of Germany and direct attacks on Italy and her possessions in Africa may be the first important step we can take toward the downfall of Germany. Moreover, in the Mediterranean Britain could concentrate its best weapon, the Royal Navy, against its weaker foe: we should undermine Italian resistance by continued offensive operations with our naval forces. Finally an important if unstated reason was that the Mediterranean was the only place where Britain could realistically assume the offensive. As one historian expressed it, Churchill owed a perverse debt of gratitude to Mussolini. If Italy had remained neutral . . . how else might the British Army have occupied itself after its expulsion from France? These were the military reasons for the decisions emanating from London in the summer of 1940.⁵\n\nThere were also compelling political reasons for Great Britain to retain a Mediterranean presence. Admiral Andrew B. Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, was reflecting common opinion when he observed on 18 June that Egypt would be untenable soon after the Fleet’s departure, Malta, Cyprus and Palestine could no longer be held, the Moslems would regard it as surrender, prospects of Turkey’s loyalty would be discounted and even the Italians would be stirred to activity. The Soviets and Americans would certainly have regarded such a withdrawal as a sign of weakness. Furthermore, behind its decision to hold Malta and transfer units of the Home Fleet to form Force H at a time when Great Britain seemed threatened by invasion, the government was confident that the United States would eventually enter the war—secret staff talks between the U.S. and Royal navies were already under way—and it believed that Stalin would distance himself from Hitler, whose enormous increase of power entailed incalculable risks for the Soviet Union.⁶\n\nWar has many consequences, and national leaders sometimes disregard inconvenient ones, especially in the name of politics. Mussolini, with the enthusiastic support of Italy’s economic elite, was certainly guilty of this when he elected to enter the war long before his military was ready. Churchill and the War Cabinet likewise failed to fully consider the long-term economic consequences of their strategic and political choices.\n\nThe hard truth was that London did not command the shipping required to simultaneously undertake a North African offensive and maintain its economy. According to one scholar, Britain lacked enough merchant shipping capacity to import the quantities of vital foodstuffs and raw materials required to meet domestic needs, fulfill imperial obligations and sustain offensive warfare at the tail end of a ten thousand mile line of supply. Britain built too few ships, sent them on too lengthy voyages, protected them poorly and unloaded them slowly. In summarizing the impact of a Middle Eastern offensive, another history noted that the effort to sustain armies in Egypt, Libya, east Africa, and elsewhere in the Near and Middle East, and to maintain naval and air power in the Mediterranean was absorbing, or was soon to absorb, half of Britain’s war production, transported at enormous cost over the long route around the Cape of Good Hope.⁷\n\nThese assertions raise the question of whether by concentrating its war effort on critical objectives, like maintaining imports and securing the North Atlantic, Great Britain could have won a less costly victory. The answer is almost certainly yes, but given the political imperatives that existed in the summer of 1940, such a strategy was unthinkable to Churchill, who believed that there must be action, even if not always useful; there must be successes, even if overstated or imagined; there must be glory, even if undeserved. The British government had to fight somewhere, and in the summer of 1940 the Mediterranean was the only choice.⁸\n\nITALY’S STRATEGIC GOALS\n\nIn 1939 Mussolini did not answer the declarations of war made by the western democracies in support of Poland with his own declaration in support of Germany because Italy was unprepared to fight. In January 1940 he spoke of intervening alongside Germany in the second half of 1941. This timetable accelerated as Germany triumphed in Scandinavia, but it was Germany’s crushing victory over France that tolled the hour. On 25 May Lord Halifax, the United Kingdom’s foreign secretary, met with the Italian ambassador in London to discuss what concessions would be required to maintain Italian neutrality. This initiative confirmed Mussolini’s conviction that the British were all but defeated and that the moment to jump in had arrived although his armed forces remained woefully unprepared. When Belgium capitulated on 27 May Italy’s foreign minister, and Mussolini’s son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano, terminated the talks, telling Britain’s Italian ambassador that we are on the brink of war.⁹\n\nItaly declared war for several reasons. The country was resource poor, and, like Great Britain, its economy depended upon imports: 86 percent of Italy’s pre-war imports, including nearly all of its coal, arrived by sea, and 75 percent of that total passed Gibraltar or Suez. The British blockades imposed in 1914–15, September 1918, September 1939, and again in March 1940, when London restricted Italian shipments of German coal (via the Netherlands), knowing full well the disastrous consequences this would have on Italy’s economy, had cemented the general conviction that, as the Duce expressed it to the president of the United States in May 1940, Italy was a prisoner in the Mediterranean and required free access to the Atlantic which it did not have under the guns of Gibraltar.¹⁰\n\nMussolini’s personal, political, and ideological ambitions required war. He shared power with the king. Victory would give him the prestige to eliminate the monarchy and marginalize the church. He had ideological reasons. Ciano wrote, it is humiliating to remain with our hands folded while others write history. . . . To make a people great it is necessary to send them to battle even if you have to kick them in the pants. Finally, Mussolini’s government had predatory ambitions. These included the annexation of Tunisia, Corsica, Nice, Malta, and portions of Dalmatia. In Mussolini’s eyes this constituted the return to Italy of national territory. Rome also sought economic and political domination of the Balkans, an expanded role in the Middle East, and control of Egypt. In short, it sought Mediterranean supremacy.¹¹\n\nSuch dominance would have benefited Italy—it would have secured the nation’s long and vulnerable coastline from attack—but British possession of Gibraltar (or the Canary Islands, if need be) and Aden would still have denied Rome freedom of the seas. A final German victory might have better solved the problem of oceanic access with little effort on Italy’s part, but the political consequences of being beholden to Germany in such a case were unpalatable to those segments of Italian society that deeply distrusted German intentions, which included King Victor Emmanuel, the economic elite, many in the government, and most Italians.\n\nOriginally, judging that \"in the likely event [of] war the colony would be isolated from the madrepatria\" and that it would face hostile armies on both frontiers, the Italian high command intended its Libyan forces to be self-sufficient for twelve months of defensive warfare. Told it would not need to convoy supplies to Africa, the Regia Marina prepared to face the offensive forays of the French and British fleets. However, the elimination of France transformed the situation, and Mussolini decided to launch an offensive from Libya as soon as possible. This decision presented the Regia Marina with the task of escorting the convoys required to support an army offensive in that inhospitable region, and it elevated Malta from being a minor irritant to an important objective because of the island’s location astride the route between Italy and Tripoli.¹²\n\nGERMANY’S STRATEGIC GOALS\n\nIn September 1939 Hitler believed that the Mediterranean had limited relevance to his nation’s aspirations, and he did not press for an Italian declaration of war. After overthrowing France’s defenses, Berlin did not even desire Italian participation. Nonetheless, Mussolini’s agenda was not Hitler’s, and by July 1940 victory in the west, along with Italy’s entry into the conflict, presented German planners with a quandary. What next? Bringing Britain to the peace table was the preferred solution, but Force H’s attack against the French fleet at Mers el-Kébir confirmed that Churchill’s war party was firmly in control, and the new prime minister scorned the poisoned olive branch Hitler proffered in his Reichstag speech of 19 July.\n\nThis left Hitler facing a two-front war come mid-1941 when the invasion of the Soviet Union was scheduled to commence. He was skeptical of Italy’s ability to support an army in Africa. Thus, leaving open the future need for some type of Mediterranean operation, the Wehrmacht concentrated on expanding its forces for the eastern campaign and threatening Britain with invasion.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine had a clearer view than did the Führer of how an assertive Mediterranean policy could advance German interests. On 6 September 1940 Grand Admiral Erich Raeder argued that the capture of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal would improve Berlin’s position in the Balkans, Asia Minor, and the Middle East and guarantee unlimited sources for raw materials. Germany would also gain strategically vital bases, particularly Gibraltar, which would aid in the Atlantic campaign. Hitler agreed in principle, but he always believed (correctly) that the war would be won or lost on the steppes and forests of Russia. Thus, Hitler’s programmatic policy in the east dominated planning, and his failure to enlist the active participation of Spain’s Generalissimo Francisco Franco and France’s Marshal Philippe Pétain in October 1940 ensured that Admiral Raeder’s Mediterranean ambitions remained unrealized.¹³\n\nDuring the last six months of 1940, when the Reich’s opportunities seemed unlimited, Germany allowed Mussolini’s parallel war to determine its future Mediterranean policy. When Italian misadventures in the Balkans and North Africa threatened the security of Romania’s Ploesti oil fields and the southern flank of the forthcoming Russian offensive, Germany acted to protect these vulnerable points. Thereafter, until November 1942 and the unexpected Allied invasion of Algeria and Morocco, the Reich was content to let Britain pour its energies into a remote region far from areas it considered important while supporting its Italian ally with minor forces.\n\nSPAIN, CHOKE POINTS, AND THE IMPACT OF SEA POWER\n\nSpain provided an example of how Great Britain applied sea power. Spain was a second-rank Mediterranean power, but it held the key to control of the Western"
