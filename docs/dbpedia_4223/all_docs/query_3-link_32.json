The report draws on our team of specialists around the world and looks at scenarios for how these trends will impact the automotive, oil, electricity, infrastructure and battery materials markets, as well as CO2 emissions.\n\nThe picture today\n\nEV sales\n\nElectric vehicle markets around the world are not all travelling in the same direction or at the same speed in 2024. Sales of EVs continue to rise globally, but some markets are experiencing a significant slowdown and many automakers have pushed back their EV targets. Progress varies by segment, with electric commercial vehicles set for another blistering year and segments like buses and two- and three-wheelers already reaching very high levels of electrification.\n\nAll figures 2023\n\nPassenger EV sales\n\nChina still dominates the global EV market, but sales are rising quickly elsewhere too. Electric vehicles are no longer only a wealthy country phenomenon. Developing economies like Thailand, India, Turkey, Brazil and others are all experiencing record sales as more low-cost electric models are targeted at local buyers\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by market\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by market\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by market\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by market\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by market\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by drivetrain\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by drivetrain\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by drivetrain\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by drivetrain\n\nGlobal passenger EV sales by drivetrain\n\nSource: BloombergNEF, Marklines, Jato.\n\nNote: Includes highway-capable passenger EVs.
