        "text": "Idea\n\nI agree with many other answerers that one major factor in the Reich losing the war was Hitler. So it's reasonable to affect a change that removes him from the picture. I like the proposal for him to have served in logistics with the consequence that he would have been a more competent war leader. However, his other issues are unlikely to change.\n\nI want to work from the following idea: there was considerable unrest in Germany when Hitler assumed power. Economy was down and the terms of the Versailles treaty were generally considered unfair. Short of a diplomatic resolution of this tension (not really the spirit of the time), war was inevitable. Given the situation, any skilled demagogue could have come to power.\n\nSo we let Hitler do this: let him come to power, unite the people behind his figure and prepare Germany for war. Then, limit his power so far that he can not hinder the war effort, ruin most international relations, and make the Reich a bad guy. Do not remove him completely -- he is a rally point -- but limit his influence.\n\nProposal\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a historian. Any serious attempt at producing a believable piece of alternate fiction based on small changes will have to be the result of extensive research.\n\nHave the Blombergâ€“Fritsch Affair in 1938 turn out differently. It becomes known in the party that Hitler had the thing set up to get rid of rivals. As a consequence, power shifts within the leading elite. While Hitler remains chancellor/president for appearances sake, his role degrades to a representative figurehead -- the real decisions are made elsewhere.\n\nRationale on why this influences the war effort in ways positive for the Reich:\n\nMost of the preparation (arguably only possible with the somewhat crazy dedication of Hitler's) has already been finished. The armed forces are well-trained, well-equipped and ready.\n\nMilitary leadership remains effective and competent. Other answers discuss multiple ways in which that helps.\n\nInternational relations will be handled in a more rational way. Appeasement does not break completely, and the Reich does not attack everybody at once.\n\nThe Holocaust (a pet project of Hitler's) does not happen. This saves resources and causes less internal and international dissent, in particular post-war.\n\nPerspective\n\nIt seems likely that much of what constitutes the EU today, with the possible exclusion of Great Britain, would have fallen under the rule of the Reich (which it pretty much was in the real time line, at some point during the war).\n\nLooking forward, a non-Hitler Reich may not have been as scary a prospect as as the Hitler Reich we've seen in our real history. It may have actually been stable after the war, at least for some years. The US may not have entered the European theater at all. The biggest conflict would probably have been between the Reich and Stalin's USSR in case it did not fall during the war. It is somewhat plausible that we'd have gotten a Cold War similar to what we actually got, but with different parties: the Reich, the USSR, and maybe the US.\n\nAssassinate Hitler\n\nIn 1941, mid war, Hitler is assassinated with the hope that this would weaken the German top ranks, cause infighting, hurt morale, and bring a faster end to the war.\n\nInstead Erich von Manstein is able to seize control quickly and stop the march against Russia. Using this as a way to open ceasefire talks, they are able to avoid having to fight on as many fronts, directing more forces against England and the allies.\n\nThe \"martyrdom\" of Hitler also doesn't hurt morale as hoped, but give the German soldiers something to rally behind.\n\nThis gives them time to dig in, which brings the allies to the negotiation table to work out an end to the war.\n\nScore: draw (but not a loss, satisfying bullet point 2).\n\nEdit: After a bit more reading, it's possible, even likely, that Germany would still have attacked Russia if Hitler was killed in 1941, but some historians believe that it would have been successful (as it very nearly was) if Hitler had listened to his generals and focused Moscow first, instead of trying for the oil fields first.\n\nContinued: (disclamer, I got a lot of what follows here if you want to skip to the source)\n\ntl;dr: Why might they attack Russia? They needed oil. Their choices were to attack the British in Egypt on the way to the middle east, or attack Russia. Russia was the stronger of the two, and was massing troops along the border. The theory was that Russia could attack in the summer of 42, so they decided to attack first, before Russia was ready. And Russia was not ready at all. Despite Having a bigger army, they had poor leadership (Stalin killed a lot of the best officers), poor communication, and poor training.\n\nGermany had victory after victory in Russia, capturing or killing millions of Russian soldiers. They got within 20 miles of Moscow before winter. They just couldn't push that last little bit.\n\nThe reason is that Hitler wanted to take the oil fields first, depriving the Russians of the resources, while the generals want to take Moscow first in order to remove the Russian leadership, and they could only put their main power behind one. Half way through Hitler decided the generals plan was better, but it was to late, and they didn't make it before winter. Russia was able to bring in more troops and push them back, hurting them badly.\n\nWithout Hitler the generals would have put the main push against Moscow and probably would have been able to take it by September.\n\nEdit 2\n\nSince comments were moved to chat, there have been some good comments about Germany attacking Russia that improve the answer\n\nMints97\n\njust my couple of cents here: taking Moscow may not have necessarily meant taking Russia. Napoleon took Moscow, but he was as far from conquering Russia as he was when he started his invasion...\n\nAgreed, and that's specifically why Hitler didn't want to focus on Moscow. He wanted to avoid the mistake that Napoleon made, and go after the resources first. For some reason his military leaders thought that Moscow was important, and managed to convince him to switch. Maybe it would have been better to stick to his original plan, or maybe they had information I don't know about.\n\nI remember reading that the communist Russian army under Stalin was not very good at taking initiative, since he killed all the independent thinking ones that might try to take over. It wasn't the same Russia that Napoleon invaded.\n\nIt's possible that with the government gone that the army would have just folded up. Or maybe not. Another what-if.\n\nThe only thing that would have let the Axis win the war is if they somehow kept the USA out of it. In an alternate reality, this is possible. No super lasers or miracles required.\n\nFirst, you need someone other than Roosevelt as President. The US Congress was all about neutrality at the time. Many were isolationist. Roosevelt was opposed to this, although he did play along to get his New Deal programs through. But Roosevelt actively supported the British before the USA entered the war.\n\nSecond, German U-Boats can't be attacking American shipping. This may not be an issue if the USA is truly neutral, and is staying out of the whole mess. It might be possible for the US to trade with both sides, although I can't see how the British Navy would allow any country to supply Germany. The British were dominant in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean, so only blockade runners might make it through.\n\nThird, Japan doesn't attack the US. With a more conservative, isolationist President in office, maybe Japan doesn't feel so threatened by the US, and therefore only makes non-threatening moves in Asia. If Japan only attacks the European colonies, then that's a European problem. The USA doesn't enter the war.\n\nIf the USA never enters the war, the British are defeated and the war ends. They gave it a really good fight, but Britain cannot do it alone. In the real time line, the USA helped keep Britain afloat before officially entering the war. In the alternate timeline, without that assistance, Britain is done by 1941. With all forces applied to the imminent defeat of Britain, Germany does not invade the Soviet Union in 1941.\n\nAfter Britain leaves the war, the Germans turn on the Soviet Union, in much more favorable circumstances. By avoiding most of the Russian winter, the Soviets are easily rolled up and done by late 1942. Stalin is deposed. The war is over. Germany takes large chunks of territory and resources from the Soviets. The British, French, Dutch, etc., all have to pay reparations and lose parts of their Empire.\n\nThere is \"peace\" in Europe in 1943. In Asia, it's another story. Now that the allied forces have surrendered to Germany, Japan gets a free hand in Asia and the Pacific. Who is going to stop them? As long as they don't provoke the USA, Japan can do what it wants.\n\nOne of the turning points of WWII was the shift from strategic bombing of the RAF sector bases by the Luftwaffe to the bombing of cities, ordered by Hitler in reprisal for the bombing of German cities by the English.\n\nHad Hitler been a little more rational, had he taken the high moral ground and declared \"The Tommies may have bombed our cities, but we will not stoop to their murderous ways\" (even though the Germans were secretly exterminating Jews, Gypsies and gays), and carried right on bombing the RAF bases, the RAF would have crumbled under the onslaught, giving the Luftwaffe free reign to go after secondary military targets such as the Royal Navy and army bases in preparation for Operation Sea Lion, the invasion of England.\n\nWith the Germans publicly refusing to stoop to the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in pointless bombing raids on cities, in contrast to the English' attacks on population centres, there would have been diplomatic counter-pressure on the other non-involved nations of the world with regard to becoming involved in this European affair, and if Operation Sea Lion succeeded in the face of a crippled RAF and RN, the US may well have stayed out of the European war entirely.\n\nAs a second example of Hitler's improved rationality, he would have held off on his negative propaganda regarding Communism and the invasion of the Soviet Union until after the defeat of Great Britain, and then choosing the appropriate time to strike to avoid the harsh Russian winters. With a greater number of experienced troops and battle-proven equipment against the Soviet Union's inexperienced troops and unproven equipment, the Germans would have been better placed to press their assault all the way to Moscow.\n\nSo many small things, mostly having to do with the Russian campaign. The simple fact is, if Germany had managed to conquer Russia in 1941, the war is over. Suddenly they have nearly unlimited oil, food and other natural resources and only one front to face. For all we like to talk about how the USA's resources would have won out, it was Russia who sucked the life out of the German Army, not the US.\n\nNow certainly they would not have been able to resist without the supplies the US gave them. But the fact is, they were THERE. Without a coherent Russian Army to supply - and to be willing to take absolutely appalling casualties and continue - our resources would not have done us much good.\n\nSo what would have done it? Well skipping the Balkan diversion that put off the invasion by something like 6 weeks would have helped. Germany was in no danger of Yugoslavia invading them.\n\nOr Hitler NOT ordering the Panzers south to trap all those Russians in the Ukraine pocket in late summer. Without that, they're in Moscow in weeks before the Russian have time to consolidate their defenses or Winter has a chance to set in.\n\nPeople forget that back then, Moscow was the HUB. Russian communications were horrendous and they all went through Moscow. You take Moscow, cut the lines and Stalin is much harder pressed to command his army because he can't even communicate with most of it. Not to mention the morale blow that would have been. And Stalin was making a show of actually staying in Moscow. Odds are they might have capture him.\n\nWhat Russia needed most of all was time. Time to get their recently moved factories running. Time to get the winter troops guarding the Japanese border to the West. Time to recover from the shock of the German attack. Time to stiffen the defenses of Moscow. Time for all the new commanders (who'd replaced the ones Stalin purged) to learn their jobs. The winter of 1941-1942 gave them that time.\n\nOverall, having an actual military man in charge and not Hitler would have done the trick. It's often been said that Hitler was the best soldier the Allies had. So true. What is amazing is that even with the idiotic decisions the man made and even after years of being worn down, the Germans were able to last until 1945. Even as late as that year, anytime an allied army met a German army in anything resembling equal strength, the Germans would always do more damage than they took.\n\nThe Weather.\n\nThis is all kind of 'supernatural' but in coincidence only:\n\nEastern Front: It's commonly understood that the cold, wet, harsh winter in Russia greatly hampered the German advance. Have an unusually warm winter in '41, '42, and '43, and it is possible if not probable that this would help to crush Russia's western troops. It was an absolute contributing factor to Germany's losses there.\n\nGerman Bombings: Rain and snowstorms erupting during bombing raids prevents the allies for even being able to target industrial complexes. Rain distributes evenly to assist in putting out the fires that raged under allied bombing.\n\nAtomic Bombs: The original target for both atomic bombs was meant to be over Kohura, but due to weather, they had to move first to Hiroshima, then to Nagasaki (twice lucky for Kohura). Imagine if weather thwarted all nearby Japanese targets, preventing the United States to use the bombs - US bombers had limited range over Japan's southern quarter, so bad weather over the general quarter would have delayed any bombing of this type for a long time.\n\nDust Bowl: More waves of drought from the dust bowl over the United States might have forced more civil works to be undertaken, as well as reluctance to support pre-war allied efforts (food), and entrance into the war.\n\nPearl Harbor: Weather patterns that prevent the Japanese carriers and bombers from approaching American territory might have kept the Japanese from \"kicking the sleeping bear,\" long enough for the other factors to encourage Japan to refocus on East China and allow America to look inward.\n\nNaval Warfare: Weather is always a factor on the outcome and procedure of naval warfare and amphibious invasion. A series of 'unfortunate' weather events could occur in favor of Axis victory.\n\nAll of these are very, very coincidental, but then was the succession of unusually cold and wet Russian winters a coincidence, or the fact that Kohura avoided the bomb twice by weather?\n\nAlso, can I be cheeky and say \"Yellowstone Super-volcano Event\"?\n\nThe key to the Allied victory in WWII is logistics and production. The United States, for example, produced something like 8 X the annual steel production of Imperial Japan at the start of the war, so the Japanese simply had no chance of winning in the Pacific once the United States was engaged. The British Empire was similarly capable of lopsided production compared to the Axis powers, and Churchill implicitly acknowledged this in his \"We will fight on the beaches\" speech:\n\nEven though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.\n\nThe British Empire, fighting alone, probably had enough manpower and industry to win WW II by 1948 (Consider that Canada, a tiny Dominion at the time, was capable of putting a million men under arms, and fielded the world's third largest navy by 1945, and Canada was only one part of the Empire).\n\nSo the only way for the Axis powers to win is not to provoke war with all the Great Powers, but rather nibble around the edges and then take them one at a time.\n\nDefeating the Soviet Union is probably the first step. The USSR was an odious nation and outside of the normal international system (both by choice and the design of the Liberal and Imperial powers of the age), and by careful use of diplomacy to make the Russians even more isolated (the 1939 \"Winter War\" with Finland might have been played that way), along with encouraging the Japanese to try to pin the Russian forces in Siberia could have crippled Russia and knocked it out of the war. Germany and Japan dismember the USSR and feed on the resources, while carefully keeping clear of the British Empire and American interests.\n\nAfter a pause of perhaps 5-10 years, it could become time to use aggressive diplomacy to sow dissent among the various member states of the British Empire. Imperial Forces become overstretched trying to police the various rebellions across the globe, and Churchill is long retired, leaving the British with something of a leadership vacuum. Germany and Japan support \"revolutionary forces\" and welcome defecting members of the Empire into the New Order and the Co Prosperity Sphere, gradually dismembering British power. Ironically, the Americans would probably be very happy to see this process, and if not encouraging it directly, they would make no diplomatic steps to stop it either.\n\nAmerica itself would be the hardest nut to crack, being a continental and oceanic power in its own right. Even with the resources of Asia and the British Empire now under Axis control, America has far more potential power because it's free market economy allows it to use resources most efficiently and develop new products and industry at unexpected times, complicating axis power. If you have any doubts, research the true story of the Axis economy during WW II. Most German aircraft were still using engines designed in 1933 at the end of the war, and obstruction by petty bureaucrats in the ship building industry long delayed the introduction of modular production of the Type XXI U Boats, to name a few. Tank production always lagged far behind the allies, and although Panther and Tiger tanks may have been far better than the opposition, they were essentially hand crafted, while Shermans and T-34's were churned out on assembly lines.\n\nThe best way to win against America again is through the indirect approach, gradually subverting South America into getting Fascist regimes (not to difficult, if you look at OTL) and gradually choking off overseas trade. America is never conquered directly, but simply declines into irrelevancy and accepts the domination of the New Order and Imperial Japan in their own spheres.\n\nAnswers that suggest that Nazi Germany not attack the USSR are technically correct, insofar that Germany would not be beaten by the rump of the Allies after the Fall of France, but this ignores the fact that conquest of the USSR had always been a primary motive of Hitler - much moreso than any concerns in the West. While there were certain failings in the invasion of the USSR; such as the lack of preparation for winter, the division of resources in multiple theatres (such as Africa), Hitler's refusal to allow retreat at a couple of important junctures, etc., the single greatest failing of the Axis was not to exploit the great antipathy among subjugated nations of the USSR towards the Kremlin.\n\nBy instigating the Hunger Plan the Axis made an enemy of nations such as the Ukraine and Baltic states. The little that they gained in raw resources was vastly outweighed by the logistical cost wrought by partisan groups in a country with notoriously poor infrastructure: never mind the vast resource of people that could have been leveraged in a war against the USSR. In a theatre where swift victory was a requirement, the implementation of the Hunger Plan was probably the single greatest strategic blunder by the Axis in the war.\n\nIn late autumn 1941, German troops were at the gates of Moscow. And this is where they suffered their first serious defeat: the failure of the Moscow offensive was both a psychological blow and an end to any hopes of a successful blitzkrieg in the East.\n\nThis first Soviet victory was possible in large part due to troops (experienced, winter-equipped troops) moved to Moscow's defense from the Far East, to the astonishment of many German commanders who believed that the enemy is on the verge of collapse with no reserves left. And this was made possible in large part by the efforts of Richard Sorge, the famous Soviet spy in Tokyo who informed Moscow that the Japanese have no plans to attack the Soviet Union anytime soon, being preoccupied with plans in the Pacific instead. And this time, Stalin chose to believe Sorge (reportedly, he ridiculed Sorge earlier the same year, when Sorge provided intelligence about the imminent German attack, i.e., Barbarossa).\n\nThis leads me to believe that if either Germany managed to persuade Japan not to pursue any plans in the Pacific until the Soviet Union is defeated, or better yet, if they simply caught Sorge (or if Sorge was simply killed in an accident) before he had a chance to transmit this critical intelligence to Moscow, the Germans might have been able to capture the Soviet capital. And that may very well have led to the collapse of Stalin's regime and a completely different (likely, far more tragic) outcome for Europe and the world.\n\nAllies were receptive to the idea of peace\n\nThere is a fair bit of evidence that Hitler was open to peaceful resolutions, but the allies were either not interested or did not trust Hitler's promises. A story where the alies \"lose\" could certainly go in two different directions:\n\nConflict with the allies ends sooner, allowing Germany to focus on Russia sooner (possibly even with the assistance of the Allies)\n\nHitler goes back on his promises and does even more dastardly deeds in the name of world domination when everyone's guard is down\n\nBritish government considers negotating peace in 1940\n\nThe argument revolves around the confusing and inconclusive records of deliberations in Churchill's cabinet in May and June 1940 over whether Britain should discuss peace terms with Germany, records over which historians have argued for the 30 years that they have been available.\n\nThere is no disagreement that the cabinet debated whether Britain should sound out Hitler on what kind of peace terms he might offer. Nor is there any doubt that Churchill made comments that do not entirely support his image as the stalwart hero, pursuing the goal of ''victory at all costs'' and refusing even to contemplate negotiations with Berlin. He is recorded as declaring, for example, that ''if we could get out of this jam by giving up Malta and Gibraltar and some African colonies,'' he would ''jump at it,'' although he didn't see any such prospect. He also declared that he was prepared to accept ''peace on terms of the restoration of German colonies and the overlordship of Central Europe,'' which presumably included continued occupation of Czechoslovakia and western Poland, although, again, he said that such an offer was ''most unlikely.''\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/25/arts/rethinking-negotiation-with-hitler.html?pagewanted=all\n\nRudolf Hess offers peace deal with Britain in 1941\n\nThe Nazis attempted to broker a peace offering with Britain - if they were allowed a free path to attack the USSR, a new book has revealed.\n\nRudolf Hess's flight to Britain during World War Two to sign a peace deal ordered by Adolf Hitler has long been recorded as a bizarre one man mission to try and reconcile warring West Europe and the Nazis.\n\nBut the high-ranking Nazi was actually carrying out orders from the Fuhrer when he flew to Messerschmitt to Scotland in May 1941.\n\nBut despite the offer, Churchill's morals were not swayed by the offer.\n\nHe refused to allow the Third Reich a clear path to attack the Eastern Front - because he did not trust Hitler's promises and it would have jeopardised his efforts to involve the U.S in the raging war, Mr Padfield says.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2433733/How-Nazis-offered-peace-treaty-World-War-II-meant-selling-Russians.html#ixzz3tMBkzFMI\n\nWe don't know. And a war hinges on many factors, not just one. But there are definitely three that are on my mind; perhaps a single one would suffice, but since only one of them is a \"large scale\" change, the other two could very easily have happened as well. So, from biggest to smallest (in \"difficulty to attain\"):\n\nMilitary: Greece.\n\nItaly's blunder in Greece (or basically, wherever they set foot in WWII, but let's focus on Greece...) meant that Germany had to divert forces, mostly from Africa, where the campaign (which originated in another, earlier blunder by Italy) was at a crucial stage, with the Commonwealth forces on the brink of defeat.\n\nOf course we don't know what would have happened if Italy had stayed out of Greece, or managed a decisive victory (possibly with planned German help), but I (and Ian Kershaw in \"Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions That Changed the World, 1940â€“1941\") consider it possible that the Africa Corps could have taken Egypt from the Commonwealth.\n\nWhat would that have meant?\n\nThe Suez channel. Taking that away would have been a huge strategic blow for Britain, basically demolishing their presence in the eastern Mediterranean. Any shipping from Britain to the asian theater and back -- military as well as commercial -- would have had to go the long way around.\n\nYugoslavia. Without Greece humiliating Italian forces right next door, Yugoslavia might well have joined the Axis for good.\n\nCrete. The whole point of this operation was to better support the Africa campaign. With Egypt and the Suez taken, Germany could have taken, besieged, or even ignored Crete without taking those losses that blunted both the German paratrooper force and air transport capabilities for the rest of the war.\n\nItalian Navy. With the command of the (eastern, at least) Mediterranean, I doubt the Battle of Taranto would have taken place quite that way, leaving the Italian Navy intact as a strategic force.\n\nItaly remains in the Axis.\n\nTheater Denial. No bombing of the PloieÈ™ti oil fields, for one. And but with Egypt and the Suez channel lost, it is even conceivable that pressure could have been applied to Gibraltar, completely securing the Mediterranean for the Axis and denying the Allies access to the southern coasts of Europe (no invasion of Sicily 1943).\n\nNo delay to Operation Barbarossa.\n\nWhich brings us to the next point:\n\nNature: Weather.\n\nThe spring muds of 1941 were quite late. Let's have weather be a bit more favourable, and with the distraction of Greece and Yugoslavia not happening, or being resolved much earlier, the Axis forces might have had those few more weeks in their favour so the attack would not freeze solid at the gates of Moscow later that year. With Moscow taken away, the railroad backbone of Russia being broken, and mostly open fields all the way to the Volga river...\n\nNow let's look at the last, easiest to attain, but probably the most important of them all:\n\nIntelligence: Not having your ciphers broken.\n\nWilli Korn not \"inventing\" the reflector would very likely have been sufficient to protect the Enigma. There are some other issues, but the reflector alone would probably have been enough.\n\nNot being all German precision on the contents of messages would also have helped, as it would have avoided known-plaintext attacks.\n\nAnd whoever the man was who repeated a 4000-character Lorenz cipher transmission without changing the key settings in August 1941, that the German war effort could have done without as well.\n\nEither one would have been dead easy, and would have taken away the biggest advantage the Allies ever had in the war: They could read Germany's cipher, basically at will.\n\nA lot of interesting answers here but many of them require two or more major changes, not just one. For example, a Nazi atomic weapon would have also required a delivery system, an \"Amerika bomber\", so that's two major changes. Also, developing an A-bomb would have required keeping the best scientific minds resident in Europe, an impossibility once Hitler started his anti-Semitic campaign.\n\nA single change that was very doable using existing technology would have been to starve Great Britain out of the war by concentrating all available resources (u boats, aircraft, and ships) on the Battle of the Atlantic. Eliminating Great Britain would have made it impossible for the Allies to carry out the strategic bombing campaign or stage the invasion. No need to invade or occupy England, simply starve them to the point where they withdraw from the conflict. Donitz possibly had just enough resources to accomplish this but Hitler kept sending U-boats to the Med on other missions instead of concentrating his forces on blockading GB.\n\nOn the flip side, the war might have been shortened considerably if the Allies had concentrated all their bombing efforts on petroleum resources instead of frittering away many aircraft and crews on ball bearing factory raids and other distractions. German armament production remained steady (and even rose) during the entire war no matter how much they were bombed but once they ran out of oil the war was over."
