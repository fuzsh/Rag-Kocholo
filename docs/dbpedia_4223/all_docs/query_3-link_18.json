        "text": "The Maltese Islands sit at the geographic, and historically, strategic center, of the Mediterranean. That position has meant that the islands have invariably been incorporated into successive Mediterranean empires. Phoenicians and Greeks, followed by Carthaginians and Romans, dominated the islands in antiquity. They were followed by Arab conquerors from North Africa, Normans and Spaniards, and eventually by the Knights of St. John—officially the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta.\n\nThe Knights received the islands in 1530, from Charles V of Spain, to hold as a perpetual fiefdom in return for the annual payment of a falcon to be made on All Saint’s Day, November 1, to the Emperor’s representative, the Viceroy of Sicily. This is the origin of the story of the Maltese Falcon. Malta does not have any indigenous varieties of falcons, but historically was home to large numbers of peregrine falcons. During the Middle Ages, it was famous for breeding and training falcons.\n\nThe Knights used the island to raid the Barbary kingdoms along the North African shore and as a base to prey on Ottoman shipping in the eastern Mediterranean. Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Emperor, called Malta a “venomous viper’s nest.” He had succeeded in expelling the Knights from their previous abode on the island of Rhodes in 1522. He tried again in 1565, in what is now remembered as the Great Siege of Malta, but failed.\n\nNapoleon conquered Malta on his way to Egypt in 1798. Malta became a British protectorate in 1800, when the Royal Navy intervened to support an uprising by the Maltese against the French. Great Britain gained permanent possession of Malta, pursuant to the Treaty of Paris in 1814. The Congress of Vienna, which sorted out post-Napoleonic Europe, subsequently reaffirmed British possession of the islands.\n\nInitially, the British hadn’t wanted Malta. They felt that Malta’s historic reliance on food imports made it vulnerable to a naval blockade. London had originally asked for possession of Sicily. It had to settle for Malta instead. The islands remained a British colony until they gained independence in 1964.\n\nFrom the 16th century on, Malta’s role became increasingly strategic. The Knights fortified the island, transformed the Grand Harbour into a major anchorage, one of the finest harbors in the Mediterranean, and built a series of fortified watch towers encircling the main islands of Malta and Gozo.\n\nMalta’s value to Great Britain was as a naval anchorage in the center of the Mediterranean. After the building of the Suez Canal in 1869, however, Malta became a critical link in the defense of the canal and the sea route from Britain to India.\n\nGreat Britain modernized the island’s fortifications and expanded the dockyards and ship repair facilities in the Grand Harbour. Malta became an important supply base and coaling station for Royal Navy ships operating in the Mediterranean or transiting the Suez Canal.\n\nDuring World War I, Malta served as a logistical base for the British war effort in the Mediterranean. It also served as a medical and rehabilitation facility for the wounded from the Gallipoli campaign. A small number of Turkish prisoners of war were also interned on Malta.\n\nAfter the end of the war, the British transferred to Malta certain high-ranking Turkish officials, with the intent of trying them for war crimes. Called the “Malta exiles” in Turkey, they were eventually repatriated when British authorities decided they lacked a legal basis to prosecute them.\n\nWhen Italy entered the Second World War, Malta found itself in the cross hairs of the Axis powers. It’s strategic location between Sicily and North Africa made it an ideal base from which to try to interdict ships carrying supplies to Italian forces and, later, the German Afrika Corps.\n\nThe Germans developed a plan, Operation Herkules, for an airborne and amphibious invasion of the islands, but shelved it following the high losses suffered by airborne troops during the Nazi invasion of Crete. Instead, the Axis powers relied on an extensive bombing campaign, coupled with submarine attacks, against convoys bringing supplies to Malta. The result was that Malta was the most heavily bombed place on earth during WW II.\n\nThe blitz over London lasted eight months, during which German bombers carried out 85 major raids on the city. During one stretch, the city was bombed on 56 of 57 days. A total of 24,000 tons of bombs were dropped on London during those eight months.\n\nThe air attacks on Malta, by comparison, lasted for two years, including one continuous stretch that lasted 154 days and nights. Malta suffered a total of 3,343 air raids, which dropped a total of 15,000 tons of bombs and destroyed 30,000 buildings.\n\nAt the time, London had a total surface area of around 500 square miles, versus 95 square miles on Malta’s main island. Malta received roughly three times as many bombs per square mile as did London, hence its designation as the most heavily bombed place on earth during the war.\n\nIn turn, Allied submarines operating from Malta sent 390,660 tons of Axis shipping to the bottom of the Mediterranean.\n\nMalta hosted the command center for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily in July 1943. Maltese military historians like to point out that the Allied liberation of Europe from the Nazis began in Malta.\n\nMany of the military facilities in Malta during WW II have since been converted to civilian use. The Malta International Airport, for example, is the former RAF Luqa airbase. There are still, however, many reminders of Malta’s WW II legacy.\n\nMalta’s WW II History Trail\n\nThe entry into Valletta’s Grand Harbour is flanked by a series of forts designed to protect both the harbor entrance and the inner harbor. These forts include St. Elmo, a star fort, in Valletta, along with Fort Tigné and Fort Ricasoli. St. Elmo stands on the seaward shore of the Sciberras Peninsula, which divides Marsamxett Harbour from Grand Harbour, and commands the entrances to both harbors.\n\nThe inner harbor was protected by Fort St. Angelo and a variety of other fortifications, while Marsamxett was protected by Fort Manoel. In 1998, the Maltese government returned Fort St. Angelo to the Sovereign Military Order of Saint John via a 99-year lease to the historic fort. The event marked the return of the Knights of Malta to the historic bastion, since they were expelled by Napoleon in 1798.\n\nAlthough these fortifications were originally constructed, starting in the 16th century, by the Knights of Malta, they were modernized and strengthened by the British garrison on the island. In addition the British built over 2 dozen additional forts, gun batteries and other fortifications. About half of those installations have been converted to civilian use or have been restored.\n\nToday, Fort St. Elmo houses Malta’s National War Museum. The museum’s collections date back to the early Bronze Age, around 2,500 BC, and trace the island’s numerous invaders in chronological order. A large portion of the\n\nmuseum is devoted to Malta’s role in World War II. The museum also houses three of Malta’s most iconic military heirlooms. These include the Gloster Sea Gladiator N 5520, named Faith. It was one of three obsolete Gloster Gladiator biplanes, nicknamed Faith, Hope and Charity, stationed at the Hal Far airbase.\n\nThey constituted Malta’s entire air defense when war broke out with Italy in June 1940. Charity was shot down on July 29, 1940, Hope was destroyed in an air raid on February 4, 1941. Faith survived the war and was presented to the people of Malta by the RAF.\n\nThe museum also contains the jeep, nicknamed “Husky,” used to drive U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt when he met in Malta with Winston Churchill. The Malta Conference was held from January 30 to February 3, 1945. It was a prelude to the Yalta conference with Stalin that began on February 4.\n\nIt also houses the George Cross, which was awarded by George VI,\n\nto the Island Fortress of Malta to bear witness to a heroism and devotion that will long be famous in history.\n\nThis was the first time that the George Cross had been given to a collective group. An act only repeated once since then, when it was awarded, in 1999, to the Royal Ulster Constabulary.\n\nThe most fascinating legacy of Malta’s WW II experience are the Lascaris War Rooms. Lascaris is an underground complex of tunnels and chambers that were hollowed out from the limestone escarpment on which Valletta sits. They housed the War Headquarters from which the defense of the islands was conducted during WW II. They also served as Eisenhower’s command center during the Allied invasion of Sicily.\n\nThe original underground chambers date back to the Knights of Malta. It was named for the Lascaris Battery, which was situated in a garden built originally by a Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, Giovanni Paolo Lascaris. In 1940, the British began to expand the tunnel complex, eventually transforming it into a 300,000-square foot underground headquarters, extending up to 150 feet below the surface of the St. Peter and St. Paul bastion built by the Knights to defend Valletta.\n\nEach of the fighting services had operations rooms in the Lascaris complex from which they coordinated the defense of Malta, convoy escorts and other military operations. The main operational command was the Combined Operations Room (COR), which coordinated inter-service operations. It was also tied into the four radar stations that surrounded the islands and was responsible for issuing air raid warnings.\n\nLascaris' \"crypto rooms\" also housed the Typex, or Type X, machines. Typex were encryption machines for secure communications that were based on an early version of the commercial Enigma machine. Unlike Enigma, that utilized three or, in the later versions, four rotors, the Typex machines utilized five rotors, making the encryption more secure.\n\nOriginally adopted by the RAF, the later models were widely used by British and many commonwealth armed forces. Typex machines continued to be used until the 1950s, and, in the case of New Zealand, until 1973.\n\nThere has been one report that Lascaris was also an important base for the deciphering of German Enigma traffic and the encoding of Ultra messages between 1939 and 1943.\n\nMalta had a sizeable Signals Liaison Unit headquartered in Lascaris that intercepted Italian and German communications in the Mediterranean theater. It’s not clear, however, whether the signals were deciphered in Malta or they were simply forwarded to Bletchley Park. Officially all Enigma traffic was deciphered at Bletchley.\n\nIn addition, naval operations were overseen from the Navy Plotting Room, while the Anti-Aircraft Guns Operations room was responsible for the island’s air defense. Fighter Command Operations oversaw the fighter squadrons based on the island, as well as rescue operations for downed pilots.\n\nThere was also a Coast Defense Room, which was responsible for the defense of Malta in the event of an amphibious invasion. Finally, there was a Radar Filter Room that displayed the status of the armed forces deployed on and around Malta and the latest naval intelligence from the naval station at neighboring Auberge de Castille. Today, that building houses the office of Malta’s Prime Minister.\n\nLascaris was steadily expanded between 1940 and 1943. It also served as the Advanced Allied HQ from which General Eisenhower, along with Royal Navy Admiral Cunningham, General Montgomery and RAF Air Marshall Tedder, directed Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Approximately 1,000 people worked in the complex during the war.\n\nAfter the war, Lascaris became the Headquarters of the Royal Navy’s Mediterranean Fleet. It played an active part during the Suez Crisis of 1956. In 1967, the facility was taken over by NATO, as its Naval Headquarters in Malta, as well as a strategic communication center for tracking Soviet submarines in the Mediterranean.\n\nDuring the NATO period, the complex was expanded with the addition of even deeper chambers, although these were never finished. The facility was eventually abandoned after NATO shifted its Central Mediterranean headquarters from Malta to Italy in 1973.\n\nIn 2009, the Government of Malta leased the Lascaris complex to the Wirt Artna Foundation (Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna/FWA). The FWA is a private foundation that has relied on private donations to rehabilitate the Lascaris complex and open it to the public as a tourist attraction. Open since 2010, it has become a popular tourist destination, especially for military history buffs.\n\nDuring the war, an extensive system of underground air raid shelters was built throughout the islands. A number of these shelters have been preserved and are open to the public. One shelter forms part of the Malta at War Museum in Birgu, on the opposite side of Grand Harbor from Valletta. From the museum, it’s possible to descend into the shelter, some 30 feet below the surface, and walk through the complex.\n\nBoat taxis will take you across from the old customs house below Valletta to the Birgu dock. The 10-minute crossing costs two euros.\n\nFor Malta, the Second World War started when fascist Italy invaded France on June 10, 1940. Within hours of the Italian declaration of war, Italian air forces staged their first air raid on the island. Mussolini’s government had long claimed Malta. With the collapse of France imminent and Great Britain’s, Mussolini believed, not far behind, the Italian dictator expected that Malta would quickly surrender.\n\nItaly already controlled Libya, 120 miles to the south of Malta, as well as the other principal islands in the central Mediterranean, Lampedusa and Pantelleria. With Sicily just 60 miles to the north, control of Malta would have given Italy complete control of the central Mediterranean and put Italy’s armed forces in a strong position to block transit between the western and eastern basins of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe initial concern, however, had been the danger of a lethal gas attack. Italy had used aerially dropped gas against both military and civilian targets during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War from 1935-37. Given Malta’s small size, it was feared it was particularly vulnerable to a gas attack from the air. British authorities had already issued gas masks to every inhabitant of the island, along with detailed instructions on how to create a gas shelter in homes and stock it with a two-week supply of food and water.\n\nAfter the air raids began, work began on digging underground shelters. These were completed within a month, and steadily expanded over the course of the war. The larger shelters could house hundreds of people and included kitchens and hospitals. As the air attacks on Malta intensified, civilians often found themselves in the air raid shelters for days at a time; often, when electrical power was knocked out, in the dark. Sanitation facilities consisted of little more than a bucket issued to each family.\n\nFort Rinella, just a few miles from the entrance to Grand Harbour, hosts one of the two largest front-loaded cannons in the world. Technically this was a gun battery not a fort, although that is how it is currently described. It is not part of Malta’s WW II heritage. The guns were installed in 1877 and decommissioned in 1906.\n\nThe rifled cannons had a diameter of 17.72 inches and could fire a 2,000-pound shell approximately 6,000 yards. At 2,000 yards, the shells could penetrate 21 inches of armor plating. By comparison, the armor plating on the Bismarck was only 13 inches.\n\nBuilt originally by the Elswick Ordnance Company, the armaments division of the British manufacturing company Armstrong Whitworth, the guns were rejected by the British government as too expensive. When the Italian Navy ordered 15 of them to arm its two newest battleships, the British military changed its mind and ordered four guns, two each, to guard the harbor entrances at Malta and Gibraltar. The guns were only test fired a handful of times, and never saw any military action.\n\nFort Rinella is another military site operated by the FWA. Along with Heritage Malta, they have been responsible for restoring many of Malta’s WW II sites.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic WW II site in Malta is the ruin of Valletta’s Royal Opera House. The building was devastated by German bombers on April 7, 1942. The ruin was eventually converted into an open-air theater and has hosted performances since 2010.\n\nThere are a variety of other WW II sites in Malta. The warning towers built by the Knights of Malta were all in line of sight of the neighboring towers and used signal fires to alert the island of an approaching raid by Barbary pirates. Some of the towers were later used by British military forces as fortified observation posts. In addition, there are a dozen gun batteries, mostly abandoned, built by the British during the late 19th and 20th century. Some of these have been restored and are open to visitors."
