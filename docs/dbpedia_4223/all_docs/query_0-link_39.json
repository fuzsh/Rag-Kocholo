Eisenhower arrived at a secret new command centre buried under the British fortress at Gibraltar. The young American general had been put in command of Operation torch, the invasion of northwest Africa. It was a colossal expedition, but planning had begun in London only a few months before. ‘Ike’ was a gifted planner and an astute leader of committees but, thus far, an inexperienced man of war. With him in Gibraltar’s Admiralty Tunnel were his staff, including his chief naval commander, the British admiral Andrew Cunningham. These two men knew the vast scale and significance of what was about to unfold. Three years later, in May 1945, having fought and won history-making battles, Eisenhower wrote a note of thanks to Cunningham. He described ‘the hours that you and I spent together in the dripping tunnels of Gibraltar’ as the one period in the whole war he would remember longest. ‘It was there,’ the general avowed, ‘that I first understood the indescribable and inescapable strain that comes on one when his part is done – and when the issue rests with fate and the fighting men he has committed to action.’1 Under Operation torch over 70,000 troops were to be transported across the Atlantic and landed in North Africa, in territory controlled by the pro-Axis government of Vichy France. The invasion was planned for the night of 7/8 November and was divided into two parts: the Atlantic coast of Morocco and Mediterranean coast of Algeria. The Morocco landing would be undertaken by American troops, who had sailed directly from the US; this was the Western Task Force. The elements of the ‘fast’ assault convoy, with over thirty transports, had departed from Hampton Roads, Virginia. At sea it met with a powerful US Navy covering force, before following an evasive course east towards Africa. xxxv\n\nxxxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe landings in Algeria would involve more troops from the US Army than from the British one. The Americans, however, were to be transported from forward bases in the UK in British convoys and escorted by the Royal Navy. These convoys to Algeria were organised as the Central Task Force (for Oran) and the Eastern Task Force (for Algiers). Like the American convoy to Morocco they would have to make long passages through dangerous Atlantic waters, proceeding south from Scotland to Gibraltar. The slower convoys sailed first, in late October, with nearly a hundred transports and over thirty escorts. The first two ‘slow’ assault convoys stole through the Strait of Gibraltar at night, on 5/6 and 6/7 November. The most important British ‘fast’ convoy, with the first wave of assault troops for Algeria, had departed the UK on 26 October, with over thirty transports. Admiral Pound, the First Sea Lord, described the British effort to Prime Minister Winston Churchill as ‘the most valuable convoys ever to leave these shores’, and the same could surely have been said on the American side.2 Amphibious or ‘combined’ operations are highly complex. The initial task of torch was to seize working ports, through which an even larger ‘expeditionary force’ with men and vehicles could later be channelled to fight a full-scale military campaign in northwest Africa. The essential preliminary stage involved putting assault troops ashore over open beaches, and five separate assault areas in Morocco and Algeria were targeted. These forces would then manoeuvre overland to take – from the rear – nearby ports, hopefully in undamaged condition. On the eve of the torch landings Eisenhower, Cunningham and their fellow commanders were hopeful that the approach of the invasion convoys had been kept secret. So many things, however, could go wrong. The vital element of surprise might yet be lost. The weather, especially the autumnal Atlantic swell off Morocco, might swamp landing craft on the invasion beaches. Defending ground forces and coastal artillery might drive off the still untested Allied troops as they came ashore. Air and submarine attacks might rip through the transport fleets standing off the beaches. The French might succeed in holding or sabotaging the main ports, preventing the unloading of vehicles and stores for the Allied ‘follow-on’ forces. The Germans might have time to rush in their ground and air forces, and the great Allied crusade of liberation would be stalled; worse yet it might be transformed into another Dunkirk evacuation. Action began, as these events so often did, in the middle of the night. Landing craft were lowered from transport ships shortly before midnight on 7 November. On the Atlantic coast of Morocco the ‘lowerings’ took place off beaches near Port Lyautey and Casablanca, and at Safi. In the Mediterranean, the landing craft were put into the water near Oran and Algiers. H-Hour, the moment the troops of Operation torch would actually begin to come ashore from their landing craft, was set for 1.00 a.m. on Sunday, 8 November.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxxvii\n\nFortune smiled on the invaders. The beaches turned out to be undefended; the main obstacles were the rough seas off Morocco and the unknown terrain. Some of the landing craft were poorly constructed; many of the crews were not fully trained. But the few French-manned coastal guns near the beaches remained silent. By about 3.00 a.m. the French commanders in Morocco and Algeria became aware that some kind of military attack was going on, but very little else was clear. They did not grasp the large-scale nature of the action, and indeed they did even know who was on the other side. In the early hours of Sunday daring Allied attempts were made to rush the main ports of Oran and Algiers, using only two small warships in each place. The American and British planners believed it was essential to prevent the French from blocking port installations before the main body of troops could arrive overland from the main invasion beaches (10 or 20 miles away). These bold attacks were carried out in darkness, but two hours had passed since the initial beach landings and the defending French warships and shore batteries were now at action stations. The Allied ships were shot up with very heavy loss of life; the worst episode was at Oran harbour, where several hundred very brave men, mostly Americans, were killed aboard the sloop HMS Hartland. Despite repeated attempts, the harbour areas were not secured. This had been a bloody setback, but by dawn on Sunday the bulk of Allied troops were safely ashore on beaches flanking Oran and Algiers; landings had also been successfully accomplished in Morocco. Advance parties dashed inland to seize airfields. As the new day dawned British and American planes from Gibraltar and from aircraft carriers off Morocco and Algeria flew in to neutralise French air bases, and to make them available for Allied air operations. The response of the local Vichy authorities was unpredictable: would they rally behind the Allied troops as liberators or would they follow the orders of the puppet government in France and offer bitter resistance? Confused, outnumbered and lacking information, local French commanders reacted in different ways. Their Air Force launched only light attacks on the fleet offshore. Their weak Army units only attempted to block movement of invading troops, rather than to fight back. The French Navy, however, mounted counter-attacks, with a cruiser, destroyers and submarines sallying forth from Casablanca and from Oran. Superior American and British naval forces, under the overall command of Admiral Cunningham, dealt quickly with this threat, sinking a number of French ships. To the northeast a powerful British fleet of carriers, battleships and cruisers shielded the Mediterranean part of the torch expedition from any action by the Italian Navy or by Vichy ships coming from bases in southern France. Events now proceeded favourably and quickly. Late on Monday morning the French high command in Algiers accepted a local ceasefire and agreed to\n\nxxxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nco-operate with the Allies. The main invasion force near Oran was able to enter that town on the following day. And the last resistance to the Americans in the Casablanca area ceased on Wednesday morning. The Allies – and Allied sea power – had prevailed; General Eisenhower’s main campaign in northwest Africa could proceed. The grand plan for torch incorporated a pipeline of fresh troops and supplies; indeed, reinforcement convoys were already at sea before the main landings. The first American ‘follow-on’ convoy to Morocco had left New York six days before the first invasion. It reached Casablanca – now securely in Allied hands – on 18 November; a much larger convoy arrived on 1 December. For Algeria a fast British follow-on convoy departed from Scotland eight days before the invasion and reached Gibraltar on the 10th – two days after the first landings. A couple of days later its ships reached Allied-controlled Oran and Algiers. It is true that northwest Africa had turned out to be a soft target. The French forces defending it were weak; the Allied expedition was strong. But the main feature was the fatally overstretched German position in the west. Spread thinly across Europe at the end of 1942, the Wehrmacht (the three German armed services) did not command sufficient ground or air forces to protect or garrison territory supposedly under the control of the Third Reich. Especially telling was the weakness of German ‘sea/air’ forces. Adolf Hitler had declared in February 1941 that ‘wherever Britain touches the continent, we will immediately oppose it, and wherever British ships put to sea, our U-boats and aeroplanes will be deployed against them until the hour of decision comes’.3 This promise had turned out to be hollow. The huge transoceanic Allied operation demonstrated the extent to which Britain and the United States now controlled the Atlantic and the western Mediterranean. The Luftwaffe (the German Air Force) had no maritime patrol aircraft in North Africa, a weakness which allowed the Allies to achieve complete surprise on 7–8 November. Neither the Germans nor the Italians had an effective bomber force in the western Mediterranean, and no heavy air attacks were made on Allied shipping in the critical first days of the landings. Meanwhile, German surface ships presented no danger to the torch convoys; in the course of the previous two years the Royal Navy and RAF had sunk them or forced them out of the North Atlantic. Nor could the German U-boats attack the invasion shipping in any strength, despite Allied ‘worst-case’ fears that fifty submarines might be engaged.4 Whatever the successes of German submarines against normal merchant shipping in 1942, the Allies were able to move large numbers of military personnel and their supplies safely across the ocean. ***\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxxix\n\nWriting in the immediate wake of World War II, the eminent British maritime historian and strategic thinker Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond set out a particular definition of ‘sea power’. It was ‘that form of national strength which enables its possessor to send his armies and commerce across those stretches of sea and ocean which lie between his country or the country of his allies, and those territories to which he needs access in war; and to prevent his enemy from doing the same’. A simpler version dates from a letter the admiral wrote in June 1942: ‘Sea power is the power of using the sea for one’s own purpose and depriving the enemy of its use’. Looking at the November 1942 invasion of North Africa in the context of four centuries of British maritime history, Richmond concluded that no example ‘of the influence of sea power upon military operations . . . is more striking than this’.5 But, in addition, between 1939 and 1945 Britain and its successive maritime allies – especially the United States – were able on many other occasions to use the sea for their own purposes and to deprive Germany, Italy and Japan of its use. This was a central reason why the Allies emerged victorious from World War II, and why the Axis powers were defeated. This book is about that struggle for the seas and oceans during the war. The structure follows the course of the maritime war from its beginning, with five parts covering the periods of the global conflict as they unfolded. Part I tells the story of the war in northern Europe between September 1939 and June 1940, as Britain and France fought Germany. The Allies possessed large navies and global empires, while Germany had limited access to the oceans and a small navy. Nevertheless, it was the landlocked power which won a series of stunning victories and gained effective control of western and central Europe. The defeat of France in June 1940 ended this period, but with a stalemate between the British Empire and the Third Reich: neither was able to knock the other out of the war. The British Army was certainly in no position to return to northwestern Europe, but sea power protected the United Kingdom from invasion. Part II deals with an even more threatening period for the British Empire, July 1940 to April 1942. In maritime terms it was now standing on its own, confronting a range of enemies. Germany made use of new forward naval bases in western France and Norway. Fascist Italy was waging an offensive war on land and sea in the Mediterranean. But for the first year of this period, at least, sea power gave Britain the ability to protect vital supply lines to North America, fight overseas campaigns in North Africa and inflict serious damage on the Axis navies – although at high cost in warships and their crews. The real crisis came in late 1941, in the later part of the period, when Imperial Japan moved from hostile neutral to active enemy, and when the maritime war changed from a European to a global one. It was hugely important that in these months Russia\n\nxl\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand the United States became allies of Britain – in June and December 1941, respectively – but at first they could contribute little directly to the war at sea. In the case of the US this impotence was unexpected and a result of the stunning surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Although the Americans lost the Philippines, the heaviest Japanese blow was directed against Britain’s empire in Southeast Asia. The Royal Navy suffered the loss of its Eastern Fleet and its base at Singapore, and suddenly the Japanese Navy seemed capable of contesting control of the Indian Ocean. Part III covers April to December of 1942 – the shortest period but in some ways the most dramatic. These seven months were certainly pivotal, as after the spring of 1942 Axis territorial expansion – in Europe and Asia – reached its limits. A genuinely global maritime war was now going on. For the first time the Axis had a powerful sea-going fleet available, as the Imperial Japanese Navy was far superior to the naval forces of the Germans or the Italians. But, by the summer, hard-fighting task forces of the US Navy were at sea both in the Atlantic and the Pacific. At the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway and Guadalcanal the Americans were able to inflict – at high cost to themselves – decisive defeats on the Japanese Navy. The British, meanwhile, were able to maintain their global shipping network in the face of a strengthened U-boat attack. The production of North American shipyards – the pump primed in 1940–41– meant by the end of 1942 that the tonnage of the Allied merchant fleet was no longer falling. The Allies used their control over the Atlantic and western Mediterranean to mount successful amphibious operations, most notably torch. The same was true in the Pacific, with the six-month battle for Guadalcanal. Part IV takes in the period from January 1943 to June 1944. In these eighteen months the British and Americans won the maritime war, a year before the overall final surrender of Germany and Japan. Massive reinforcements in the form of warships, cargo vessels, amphibious shipping and aircraft became available, with the number of ships and aircraft in the US Navy first matching, and then rapidly overtaking, that of their British ally. The maritime Allies together strengthened their control of the global shipping lanes, and won decisive victories in battle. The Italian fleet surrendered to the British in September 1943, and the US Navy won its decisive offensive victory over the Japanese in the Philippine Sea in June 1944. In both the Mediterranean and the Pacific the Allies together demonstrated a mastery of amphibious warfare. Part V covers the last year of the war (from June 1944 to August 1945) when the Allies used their command of the sea to complete the defeat of the Axis. Ground troops in huge numbers were moved across the Atlantic before and after D-Day in Normandy to complete the destruction of the Wehrmacht. The transport of the Allied expeditionary forces into northwestern Europe, espe-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxli\n\ncially the ‘follow-on’ forces of the US Army, was the climax of ‘using the seas for one’s own purposes’ during World War II. At the same time the surrender of Japan was achieved; bases were seized in the western Pacific from which the main islands of the last Axis power could be blockaded and bombarded. The book will not be a simple ‘operational narrative’ of all these events. As well as telling the story of the maritime war it will take in a range of important background factors: national naval strategies, capabilities and traditions; the role of individual leaders; rivalry and co-operation between the various military services; overall technical competition and change; the background role of logistics and intelligence. Especially important are the links between land and sea operations, and battles to attack and defend merchant ships. The book stresses throughout the way in which the war for the seas was technologically unlike any previous conflict, especially in the way in which the operations of sea, ground and air forces were interconnected. The historian Paul Kennedy has referred to ‘a new hybrid form of power, part air, part sea’, and the term ‘sea/air’ warfare will be used throughout the present book. I prefer ‘sea/air’ to ‘air–sea’ as it emphasises the centrality of the sea – and the notion of the fighting above it, on it and under it.6 The approach is international. The maritime effort of all the major maritime powers is brought in, including those of the British Empire (especially Britain and Canada), the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the Soviet Union. The last three states, it must be said, have not received as much attention as they might from British and American historians. Furthermore, the story arcs of the various participant states – and navies – were very different; an extreme example would be the contrast between the United States and France. Watertight divisions cannot, of course, be made between the various periods of the war. The conflict was a global one, and there is a difference between decisive battles fought over two or three days and long campaigns of attrition (like the six-year ‘Battle’ of the Atlantic). Events cannot be related in strict linear form unless history is reduced to chronology. Some narrative detours are, therefore, necessary, but each chapter does deal with a coherent subject. *** A few words are in order as to how this book about the sea war came about. My previous writing on World War II has been concerned with that most nonmaritime of fighting theatres, the steppes and forests of Russia; this experience had the advantage of giving me a different perspective from that of the expert naval historian. However, my interest in naval history goes back a long way. I was born near Chatham in Kent, where my father had been serving alongside the wartime\n\nxlii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRoyal Navy. Much of my childhood was spent near New York in a small Long Island town where, in early 1930, the first workshop of the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Company was located; Grumman would eventually design and produce the most important naval aircraft of World War II, built in huge numbers. And my home is now in Glasgow on the Clyde, a river steeped in the history of global maritime trade and the construction of warships and merchantmen. *** Heather McCallum at Yale University Press provided inspiration and long-term support for this project. The patient advice of Marika Lysandrou, my editor at Yale, also proved invaluable. Jacob Blandy provided comprehensive and wellinformed advice as copy-editor. I would not pretend to expertise in all the many and distant reaches of the global war for the oceans. In this respect, a number of colleagues, with specialist knowledge much fuller than my own, have kindly taken the time to look over parts of the manuscript. These include Marcus Faulkner, John Gooch, Ilya Grinberg, Steven Kepher, Joseph Maiolo, Phillips O’Brien, Alessio Patalano, Klaus Schmider and Martin Thomas. I would also thank two anonymous readers who provided Yale with their overall comments. Any remaining errors and omissions, of course, remain my own responsibility. Christopher Black kindly helped with Italian translations. Sergei Vinogradov and Christopher Wright have, over the years, provided advice and rare publications on the Soviet Navy. In Glasgow Alan Clements and Michael McAvoy provided welcome encouragement and support. Working with George Franklin and Gjert Lage Dyndal, two outstanding and well-informed graduate students at Glasgow University, taught me much about anti-submarine technology and maritime patrol aircraft. My Glasgow friends and colleagues Ben E. Shepherd and Alexander Marshall offered long-term general encouragement. In addition, the staff at the National Library of Scotland and the University of Glasgow Library were of great help in providing books, articles and inter-library loan material. And, as always, gratitude is due to my wife Gillian for her sustained patience; this vessel has been on the stocks for a long time.\n\nPART I\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR SEPTEMBER 1939–JUNE 1940 As far as the Navy is concerned, obviously it is in no way very adequately equipped for the great struggle with Great Britain . . . Admiral Erich Raeder, 3 September 1939\n\n1\n\n2\n\nchapter \n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR September 1939–April 1940\n\nTHE SINKING OF THE ATHENIA, 3 SEPTEMBER 1939 The SS Athenia was a substantial vessel, but not one of the great liners; a passenger ship of some 13,500 tons, with accommodation for 1,000 passengers, her speed was 15 knots: the white stripe on her single thin black funnel marked her as one of the ships of the Donaldson Atlantic Line. Completed in 1923, she regularly carried passengers – often emigrants – from the Britain Isles to Canada. In August 1939 there was a new urgency to get aboard, among those hurrying to escape the outbreak of another European war. The Athenia left Glasgow, bound for Montreal, on the evening of 1 September; that day, Germany had invaded Poland. After picking up passengers at Belfast and Liverpool, the liner sailed out into the open Atlantic on the 3rd. A few hours earlier the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, had announced a state of war with Germany. In the afternoon of the 3rd, south of Rockall, and about 200 miles out into the ocean, the Athenia was sighted by a U-boat cruising on the surface. The captain of the U 30 decided to attack and submerged his boat; no warning was given. At about 7.30 p.m. torpedoes were ordered to be launched. One struck home, and the passengers and most of the crew of the Athenia took to the lifeboats. Messages got through to the Admiralty with some delay via Malin Head in County Donegal. ‘Important Admiral Rosyth intercept 2207 Jamming near Athenia GFDM 1400 passengers some still aboard Sinking fast bearing 291 approx.’ HMS Electra arrived with two other destroyers to rescue survivors from the stricken ship: ‘Surrounded by wreckage and the inevitable oil slick, she lay at a drunken angle, with the falls of the lowered boats trailing in the water, and giving her an untidy, bedraggled, appearance, accentuating her air of helplessness.’1 The liner took fourteen hours to go down, and most of the fatalities resulted from the initial torpedo explosion or from poor handling of the 3\n\n4\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\nlifeboats. Altogether ninety-three passengers (eighty-five of them women and children) and nineteen crew members perished. The U 30 was one of eighteen submarines that had been ordered to take position near British waters in late August 1939. One of the first Type VII (medium-sized) submarines commissioned into the new Kriegsmarine (Navy) of the Third Reich, the U 30 had been completed in the autumn of 1936. Her captain was Lieutenant Fritz-Julius Lemp, at twenty-six years old one of the youngest officers to command a U-boat. Like all other U-boat commanders, Lemp had been instructed to obey the German Navy’s prize rules, which followed international law. Merchant ships were supposed to be warned before attack, giving their crews the chance to make for a place of safety. The Nazi government in Berlin was keen – at this stage at least – to limit the scope of the war and to avoid upsetting powerful neutrals like the US. U-boat attacks on merchant ships had political implications; such events had been used in 1917 by the US to justify entry into World War I. In any event Lemp later claimed that he thought the rules did not apply in this case, because he had identified his target as a combatant. She had been acting suspiciously, and he believed she was an ‘armed merchant cruiser’ (AMC) – a fast merchant ship deployed by the Royal Navy as an ‘auxiliary cruiser’. Lemp only realised on listening in to the BBC that he had sunk a passenger ship performing her normal activities. He compounded his blunder by failing to report to base. German naval headquarters must have guessed what had happened. On 4 September it put out a secret alert forbidding submarine attacks on passenger ships, even in convoy. Meanwhile the authorities in Berlin denied any involvement. When the U 30 eventually returned to Wilhelmshaven three weeks later, the senior officer, U-boats, a commodore named Karl Dönitz, stood on the quayside to meet her. Lemp requested a private word and admitted what had happened. The commodore immediately put him on a plane to Berlin to explain himself to higher authorities. Dönitz – according to a statement made at the 1946 Nuremberg trial – punished Lemp on his return by confining him to his quarters, but he did not authorise a court martial. His view was that the young captain had made a genuine mistake in the confusion of ‘battle’. He accepted the view of his superiors that open action against Lemp would be embarrassing. Dönitz’s staff entered a report in the war diary of the U-boat command which mentioned two other merchant ships sunk by the U 30 (in both cases in accordance with prize rules), but not the Athenia; a replacement page for 3 September was crudely inserted in the U 30’s logbook. The captain of the U-boat thus escaped any real punishment. Not only was Lemp not court martialled for disobeying orders, but the Navy awarded him the Iron Cross (2nd Class) in late September, and promoted him to the rank of lieutenant commander (Kapitänleutnant). The U 30 carried out further patrols\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n5\n\nunder his command; Lemp turned out to be just the sort of aggressive submarine commander the Kriegsmarine (and other navies) craved. In November 1939 he damaged the British battleship Barham north of Ireland with a torpedo; the following year he was awarded the Wehrmacht’s highest military medal, the Knight’s Cross (Ritterkreuz). The official German version was a lie. There is no evidence that the Athenia was zig-zagging or that she was blacked out – it was not yet dark as she approached the U 30. She may have been somewhat off the main shipping route; the captain of the Athenia refused to reveal his course to the British civilian inquiry, as he had been ‘under secret naval instructions’. While the Athenia was a plausible armed merchant cruiser (her Donaldson Atlantic Line sister ship, the SS Letitia, served in this role from November), at the start of September Britain did not yet have any AMCs in commission. Lemp later took command of the new U 110. This submarine was attacked by British warships south of Iceland during her second patrol, in May 1941, and forced to surface. The crew failed to scuttle the badly damaged boat, and a British boarding party salvaged the Enigma cypher machine and confidential code papers; the capture greatly aided the later interception of German radio signals. Lieutenant Commander Lemp was drowned.\n\nTHE KRIEGSMARINE: THE NEW GERMAN NAVY On 3 September 1939, the same day that Lieutenant Lemp sank the Athenia, his ultimate superior in the German Navy drafted a pessimistic and bitter memorandum. ‘Today’, wrote Admiral Erich Raeder, ‘the war against France and England broke out, the war, according to the Führer’s previous assertions, we had no need to expect before about 1944.’ Raeder outlined the fleet of ships that might have been available in 1944–45, a fleet with which Germany – along with its allies – could have defeated the Royal Navy and isolated the United Kingdom; ‘the prospect . . . of bringing about the final solution [sic] of the British problem would have been good.’ Today, however, the situation was very different: As far as the Navy is concerned, obviously it is in no way very adequately equipped for the great struggle with Great Britain . . . It is true that in the short period since 1935 . . . it has built up a well-trained, suitably organised submarine arm . . . the submarine arm is still much too weak, however, to have any decisive effect on the war. The surface forces, moreover, are so inferior in number and strength to those of the British Fleet that, even at full strength, they can do no more than show that they know how to die gallantly and thus are willing to create the foundations of later reconstruction.2\n\n6\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\nAdmiral Raeder was the central figure in the Kriegsmarine in the first half of the war. When the fighting began he was sixty-three years of age, the oldest member of Hitler’s military high command. He had already been head of the Navy for eleven years, having taken over five years before Hitler and the Nazis came to power. He would serve on until the start of 1943. Raeder had entered the Imperial Navy in 1894 and progressed rapidly. From 1912 until 1917 he was on the staff of Admiral von Hipper, who commanded the battle-cruiser force. In this capacity he took part in the battles of Dogger Bank (1915) and Jutland (1916), and in 1917 he became Hipper’s chief of staff. In 1918–19 he suffered the treble shock of mass naval mutiny, the abdication of the Kaiser and the surrender of the best ships of the fleet to the British. Raeder’s career prospered in the small post-war Reichsmarine; he reached flag rank in 1922. His involvement in the unsuccessful right-wing Kapp Putsch of 1920 briefly sidetracked him into work on the official history of the German Navy during the war. Significantly – for his future strategy – Raeder wrote the volumes on oceanic ‘cruiser warfare’ (Kreuzerkrieg) against Allied merchant ships. By the middle of the 1920s he was given a mainstream post, and in 1928 he was brought in to take overall command of the German Navy; he received the title Commander-in-Chief, Navy (Oberbefehlshaber der Marine, or OBdM), in 1935. Like much of the military elite, the admiral had welcomed the coming to power of Hitler and the Nazis in 1933. From January 1937 he wore on his uniform the Golden Party Badge, with the initials ‘A.H.’ stamped on its reverse. He shared many of the attitudes and aspirations of the new rulers of Germany. But while the rebirth of a strong Germany was important to him, even more essential was the creation of a powerful navy. In 1934 the German naval high command moved into a striking ten-storey modernist office block, Shell-Haus, on Berlin’s Tirpitz Embankment. Admiral Raeder continued the development of a new navy, with France and Poland as its most likely opponents. He was not a blinkered conservative in terms of naval doctrine, nor was he prepared to confine his operations to coastal defence. Having seen the woeful experience of the German High Seas Fleet (Hochseeflotte), which festered in port for most of the 1914–18 war, he became an advocate of offensive operations; these were to be carried out both in the North Sea and in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. A powerful force of cruisers would deny potential enemies the use of their oceanic shipping routes. Not surprisingly, in view of the success of Germany’s submarine campaign in World War I, he also supported the development of the U-boat force. When the Nazi government began to release funds for comprehensive rearmament he proved an effective participant in inter-service competition; he made the Navy’s case effectively, in\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n7\n\nthe face of a powerful Army and a rapidly growing Air Force. In particular, he carefully cultivated a relationship with Adolf Hitler. Hitler, for his part, is sometimes accused of not ‘understanding’ sea power, but that is not a very meaningful criticism. He had a broader perspective than that of simple navalism. In his writings and speeches before 1933 he had criticised the overseas colonial ambitions of the Kaiser’s Germany, and its development of the High Seas Fleet; these policies, in his view, had fatally antagonised Britain. When he came to power in January 1933 he had not given much thought to the Navy. At his first one-to-one meeting with Admiral Raeder three months later he expressed a lack of interest in the sea, and a desire to stay on good terms with the British. It is clear that he was, then and later, essentially a ‘continentalist’, and in geopolitical terms that was sensible enough. In the short term he aimed to restore Germany’s position in central Europe, settling scores with the French; in the longer term he wanted to control a raw-material base even further east in the Russian steppe. These goals would logically be best served by the Army, which also helped maintain the internal security of the Third Reich. In addition he took a great interest in the development of an air force, a project championed by his close Nazi comrade, Hermann Göring. The overarching reality was that any naval build-up demanded time and long-term planning. Hitler was the opposite of a long-term planner; he was an opportunist, although often a clever – and lucky – one. Nevertheless, Hitler did want to build up the new Kriegsmarine (as the Reichsmarine was renamed in June 1935), and he provided it with considerable resources. He was aware that whatever his immediate geopolitical objectives some use of the sea would be essential. If the Führer was no expert about what the Navy’s ships would do in wartime, he knew they conferred significant international prestige, as well as potentially providing a diplomatic and deterrent advantage. He seems to have got on well with Admiral Raeder and dealt with him – a man thirteen years his senior – with respect. In January 1938 Hitler took over from Field Marshal von Blomberg as head of the Reich Ministry of War, co-ordinating the three armed services: for Raeder, an ‘impartial’ civilian – Hitler – was preferable to an Army field marshal who favoured his own service at the expense of the Navy. Raeder and Hitler seem to have had only one pre-war falling out, in November 1938, over the shipbuilding programme; the admiral offered his resignation but it was not accepted. The Kaiserliche Marine had been – if only for a decade before 1914 – the second largest navy in the world. But Germany had lost the Weltkrieg, and under the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles its fleet had been greatly cut down – with ships forcibly scrapped or surrendered as reparations. Naval personnel were now limited to 15,000 men. The treaty designated a number of warships which would form the new German Navy. Excluding a small reserve, there were\n\n8\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\nsix pre-dreadnought battleships (launched in 1902–05), six small cruisers, twelve destroyers and twelve torpedo boats.3 The treaty also imposed blanket bans on German military aircraft and submarines (although these could to some extent be circumvented). The treaty did provide for replacements; larger ships could be retired twenty years after their launch date, and smaller ships after fifteen years. There were limits on the size of these replacements. What the French-language terms of the treaty described as a cuirassé (‘armoured ship’) could not exceed a displacement of 10,000 tons; for cruisers the limit was 6,000 tons, and for destroyers 800 tons (this at a time when new battleships of the major fleets displaced 25,000–30,000 tons and destroyers 1,200 tons). Before the Nazi takeover in 1933, German shipyards had completed, as replacements, five light cruisers and a number of small destroyers. Construction had also begun of a new class of 10,000-ton ‘armoured ships’ (Panzerschiffe) – three vessels taking the place of three now over-age pre-dreadnoughts. For the first two years after coming to power in January 1933, Hitler was concerned with building up his position at home and avoiding intervention by outside powers. He made few foreign policy initiatives and, formally, Germany abided by the terms of the Versailles Treaty. Naval construction, within treaty limits, continued. Panzerschiff ‘A’ (the Deutschland) was completed in April 1933; the Admiral Scheer (‘B’) and the Admiral Graf Spee (‘C’) followed in November 1934 and January 1936. Meanwhile, the Nazi government began covert preparations for an all-round breakout from the Versailles armaments limits, especially with respect to ground forces and military aviation, but also the Navy. In May 1934 the German dictator agreed that the next two projected Panzerschiffe (‘D’ and ‘E’) could be modified beyond the Versailles limits. (This modification was directly in response to the laying down by France of two new fast battleships, the Dunkerque and the Strasbourg.) In any event, the planned ‘replacement’ ships would eventually have an official displacement of 26,000 tons, and be 150 feet longer than the ‘Deutschland’ class Panzerschiffe. Their main armament would be nine rather than six 11-inch guns.4 The vessels were actually laid down in May 1935, and would be completed as the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau. Because of bottlenecks in the German engineering industry, the Scharnhorst was equipped with steam turbines manufactured in Switzerland. The first two new 1,625-ton destroyers – more than twice Germany’s Versailles limit for destroyer size (800 tons) – were begun in October 1934 and completed in early 1937; by September 1939 a further nineteen destroyers would be commissioned. In March 1935 Hitler issued a proclamation which openly denounced the disarmament clauses of the sixteen-year-old Versailles Treaty. Most importantly\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n9\n\nhe re-introduced conscription for the German Army, and the existence of the Luftwaffe was admitted at the same time. The other European powers could make no effective response. More remarkable from the naval – and diplomatic – point of view, Germany was able in June 1935 to make an agreement with the British government which permitted the construction of all types of warship. London had long believed that the harsh terms of 1919 were unsustainable and counter-productive. Aware that Hitler’s Germany would, in any event, now ignore the treaty, the British attempted damage limitation, at least in terms of naval forces. Without consultation with France, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was signed, which allowed Germany to build up to 35 per cent of British tonnage in all the various categories of warship: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, etc. The battleship tonnage allowance for Germany was now about the same as the French and Italian battleship allowance specified in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty; at 175,000 tons, this had been 33 per cent of the British and US totals.5 Tonnage and armament of these Germans vessels were in effect limited only by the Washington Treaty and the 1930 London Treaty, which applied to all the major navies. Germany possessed shipyards capable of building large warships, although their facilities required expansion. The most important were the naval dockyards at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, and the private yards of Blohm & Voss (Hamburg), Deschimag (Bremen) and Germaniawerft (Kiel). By 1936 new warships of all classes were under construction. In July 1935 the Admiral Hipper, the first of five planned conventional (8-inch gun) heavy cruisers, notionally of 10,000 tons, had been laid down. Completed in April 1939, she was followed by the Blūcher and the Prinz Eugen.6 In July 1936 construction began at Hamburg of the first fullsized battleship (ship ‘F’), notionally of 35,000 tons, with eight 15-inch guns; she became the famous Bismarck. Her final design displacement was 41,700 tons, although this was ‘legal’ by the time of her launch; in March 1938 the powers formally involved in the naval limitation process had accepted a 45,000-ton limit for battleships. She was followed in the Wilhelmshaven shipyard three months later by the future Tirpitz (ship ‘G’). Many of these warships would play a role in the naval battles of World War II. In terms of the future history of the war, however, it was submarine development and construction that would be most important. The Reichsmarine had kept abreast of submarine technology in the 1920s, and a German-led design and construction firm in the Netherlands produced a small number of boats for foreign navies. In 1934 fittings and machinery for submarine construction began to be assembled in Germany. The first 250-ton coastal/training boat (Type II), the U 1, was commissioned in June 1935; she was followed by two dozen more of this class. Dönitz, then a captain and commander of the first\n\n10\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\nU-boat flotilla, was influential in developing doctrine. He favoured group attacks, and this led to construction emphasis on a large class of the relatively small (by international standards) ‘500-ton’ Type VII class, the first of which (the U 27) was completed in June 1936. The other major wartime class would be the longer-range ‘720-ton’ Type IX; the first boat of this class (the U 37) was completed in August 1938.7 Naval aviation was, however, a significant weakness. This was partly because of Germany’s late start (resulting from the Versailles Treaty), partly because the naval leadership had limited interest in aviation even in the second half of the 1930s, and partly because Hermann Göring and his Luftwaffe wanted control of all military aircraft. A 28,000-ton aircraft carrier, the Graf Zeppelin, was laid down in December 1936 and launched in December 1938; problems with her complex 200,000-shp machinery (the largest in any German ship) and the low priority given the project by both the Navy and the Air Force meant that she would never be completed. In early 1939 Raeder made a deal with Göring, who also had great influence as head of the Four-Year Plan for the overall development of the Nazi economy. The big shipbuilding programme, with all its steel and labour requirements, was given the green light, and in exchange the Navy did not demand its own air force. Much has been made by historians of this shipbuilding programme, the tenyear Z-Plan. Hitler secretly approved it in January 1939, and at the same time gave the Navy a high priority in steel allocation. The Z-Plan had no effect on the reality of World War II. At its core were six planned 55,500-ton diesel-powered battleships armed with eight 16-inch guns. Battleships ‘H’ and ‘J’ were laid down in Hamburg and Bremen in the summer of 1939, but they were cancelled as soon as the war began in September. The projected Kriegsmarine was to have included, by 1948, thirteen battleships and battle cruisers, four aircraft carriers, eight heavy cruisers, thirteen light cruisers, twenty-two 6,300-ton ‘scout cruisers’, sixty-eight destroyers and 249 submarines.8 The battleship-heavy mix of ship types was indicative of a conservative technical perspective, and it has also been argued that the plan was quite unrealistic in terms of the fuel-oil resources available to Germany at the time.9 In any event, on 29 April 1939 Hitler denounced the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. A momentous guarantee had been made to Poland by Britain and France on 31 March 1939, promising support if Polish independence was threatened. The following day, 1 April, was memorable for the Kriegsmarine, as Hitler travelled to Wilhelmshaven to take part in the launching of the battleship Tirpitz. (He had also been present at the launch of the Bismarck in Hamburg three months earlier.) After the launch of the Tirpitz the Führer boarded the nearby Scharnhorst. On the battleship’s quarterdeck he presided over a ceremony at which Raeder’s\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n11\n\nforty-five years of naval service were celebrated, and he promoted Raeder to the exalted rank of Grossadmiral. Hitler expressed the hope that the head of his Navy would continue in his post for a long time to come. The dictator then departed for a three-day North Sea cruise on the newly completed liner Robert Ley (sister ship of the ill-fated Wilhelm Gustloff).10 Navies could not be quickly expanded – the construction of the biggest vessels took a long time. The fact that such ships could be kept in service for twenty or thirty years greatly favoured the traditional naval powers, with their head start. Allied military unpreparedness did not apply to naval forces. In 1939 the Third Reich had two battleships in service, compared to twenty-two for Britain and France. The Kriegsmarine had no aircraft carriers (compared to eight for the Allies), ten cruisers (compared to seventy-two) and twenty-one destroyers (compared to 253). The Navy was even behind in submarines, with only fifty-seven U-boats (compared to 141 Allied submarines).11 Raeder was among a handful of senior officers who were privy to Hitler’s pre-war diplomatic and military plans. Indeed, he would be one of two dozen senior German leaders tried as major war criminals at Nuremberg in 1946, accused of plotting wars of aggression. (He was one of twelve spared the death penalty; sentenced to life imprisonment, he was released due to ill health in 1955.) He attended with a few other military leaders the meetings of 5 November 1937 and 23 May 1939 at which Hitler laid out his plans for gaining control of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland by military means, even at the risk of general war. From May 1938 the Kriegsmarine began seriously to plan for war with Britain, which Hitler now believed would be in the ranks of the likely opponents of the Third Reich. Following the directives of the Wehrmacht high command in the spring of 1939, the Naval War Staff (the Seekriegsleitung or SKL) under Admiral Otto Schniewind drafted plans for a naval war against Poland, with contingency plans for dealing with British, French or Russian intervention. However, as Admiral Raeder implied in his 3 September 1939 memorandum, he had not expected that the Führer’s daring diplomatic moves would actually lead to a general war. The possibility of fighting had indeed become more real in April 1939, but Poland might be crushed without external intervention. Moreover, the August pact with Stalin’s Russia was an astonishing diplomatic coup. But Hitler – and Raeder – had fatally underestimated the resolve of the British and French governments.\n\nBRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES When war broke out on 3 September the leaders of the British Royal Navy were certainly more confident than was Admiral Raeder in Germany. Britain still\n\n12\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\ncontrolled the largest navy and merchant marine in the world, and the Empire provided a global system of naval bases. Her French ally possessed a powerful fleet,12 and Fascist Italy – contrary to expectations – had remained neutral. The German and British command systems were different. Admiral Raeder’s opposite number (and near contemporary) was Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff. Pound had taken up his post only two months before the war broke out, following the fatal illness of his predecessor. Like Raeder, he would serve on through the middle of the war, until 1943. Unlike Raeder, Pound possessed extensive active command experience. He had been captain of a dreadnought at the Battle of Jutland, and he was Chief of Staff and then Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Mediterranean Fleet in the 1930s. As First Sea Lord, he was in an unusual situation compared to the other two British service chiefs (Army and RAF): he had both a day-to-day operational role and an administrative one. The abilities of this First Sea Lord have aroused much controversy. He was certainly not in good health, and by 1941 showed signs of his age. The historian Correlli Barnett summed him up as a ‘hard working plodder of limited intellectual range and interests’, and a man with ‘a lack of wide strategic grasp and . . . a habit of directing in detail’. The judgement of Arthur Marder was rather different. For that eminent American naval historian, the admiral was reserved and humourless, but he noted that Churchill (as First Lord of the Admiralty and then Prime Minister) was impressed by Pound’s ‘energy, keen intellect and analytical mind, and mastery of his profession’. Above all, in Marder’s view, ‘Pound feared neither God, man, nor Winston Churchill’.13 Even Pound’s critics accepted that he proved adept at containing some of the demands of that altogether more dynamic character. Unlike in Germany, British civilian politicians, above the First Sea Lord, had direct overall responsibility for the Royal Navy. Churchill had been appointed to be First Lord of the Admiralty (in effect Minister of the Navy) by Prime Minister Chamberlain on 3 September. Neither Churchill’s predecessor (Lord Stanhope) nor his successor (A.V. Alexander, from 1940 to 1945) was very memorable. Churchill, however, was a powerful and energetic figure with the widest range of ministerial experience, although he had been out of the Cabinet, ‘in the wilderness’, for ten years. He was knowledgeable about military affairs and took a strong – perhaps damagingly strong – interest in operational details. He had previously served as First Lord from 1911 to 1915, when the Royal Navy was at its greatest power and prestige. He could be counted on to protect its interests; when he took over, the signal ‘Winston is back’ was transmitted to the fleet. Churchill was destined for even greater things, but when he became Prime Minister in May 1940 he maintained – as Minister of Defence – a very strong influence in naval matters.\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n13\n\nThe British had a better high command structure than the Germans (and until 1942 a better structure than the Americans). This was partly thanks to their long experience in World War I; furthermore, in comparison with the Americans they had a two-year head start (from September 1939) in World War II. As a parliamentary democracy, decisions were made in Britain with a degree of collective discussion, unlike in Hitler’s Germany. The ministerial War Cabinet functioned efficiently, and the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COS), with its network of sub-committees, became increasingly effective. Inter-service rivalry certainly existed, but it was less marked than in other countries. For the Navy the centre of activities was the Admiralty Building in London’s Whitehall, off Trafalgar Square. In 1940 a bomb-proof bunker was added on the side of Horse Guards Parade, jokingly known as ‘Lenin’s Tomb’. The members of the Board of Admiralty controlled from this complex the various functions of the Navy. The Royal Navy operated two major fleets in September 1939, the Home Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet, although there were also a number of overseas stations and shore commands within the United Kingdom itself. Unlike the Germans – and at this stage even the Americans – the Royal Navy had the advantage of a global network of bases and ports. In Britain, the main fleet base was at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland, although it was not well defended at first. There were also bases and headquarters at Portsmouth and Plymouth (Devonport) on the south coast, Chatham in the Thames estuary (the ‘Nore’), and Rosyth, near Edinburgh in Scotland. British rearmament, especially naval rearmament, has aroused decades of controversy among historians. This was the era of the so-called ‘Ten-Year Rule’, which was ostensibly used as the basis for limiting defence expenditure; introduced in 1919 and confirmed by Winston Churchill (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) in 1928, the policy assumed there would be no major war in that period. It is really hard, however, to accept the view that the Royal Navy slept through or ignored reality in the inter-war years. One eminent historian (Paul Kennedy) describes these as ‘years of decay’, another (Correlli Barnett) cites ‘twenty years of national illusion . . . and neglect’.14 The reality is that Britain ended World War I in 1918 with much the largest navy in the world. Despite scrapping many ships and accepting nominal parity in capital ships with the US, the Royal Navy remained the best-equipped, most experienced and widely deployed naval force in the world. The Navy of Britain’s twentieth-century sea-power rival, Germany, had essentially been eliminated; the same was true of the Russian Navy, after the 1917 revolution. The new naval arms control treaties also did not have the effect of ‘demolition work on British seapower’ that historians and navalists sometimes\n\n14\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\nascribe to them.15 The 1922 Washington Treaty, already mentioned in the German context, led to British acceptance of parity in capital ships with the expanding US Navy. There was, however, no likelihood of fighting the US, and a strong American Navy was surely in British interests; this had been the case in 1917–18, and would be so again in 1941–45. A naval war with the old enemy across the Channel was also unlikely, but in any event the treaty set the tonnage limit of French capital ships at one-third the British. The same ratio (3:1) applied to the Italians although, even in the early years of Mussolini, Italy did not seem a probable enemy. The only halfway-realistic potential enemy in the 1920s was Japan, which had been a naval ally of Britain from 1902 to 1923. The Japanese capital ship allowance, however, was set at only 60 per cent of the British, and the foreign policy of Tokyo was not yet dangerous. Britain also had the world’s largest shipbuilding industry, and it held that position throughout the 1920s and 1930s, although the industry was weaker in the second decade. There were seven shipyards, all privately owned, which were able to build battleships and – later – fleet aircraft carriers: Vickers-Armstrongs (Tyne) and Swan Hunter in Newcastle, Cammell Laird in Liverpool, VickersArmstrongs in Barrow (Cumbria), Fairfield and John Brown on the Clyde, and Harland & Wolff in Belfast. Half a dozen other yards were capable of building cruisers. Only two major warship-building yards closed in the inter-war period, neither of the first rank.16 After 1922, in accordance with the Washington Treaty, the Royal Navy did begin to scrap many ships, including a number of modern battleships and battle cruisers scarcely ten years old and armed with 13.5-inch guns. All the same, the Royal Navy was left with the ten most powerful battleships to serve in any navy during World War I, the ‘Queen Elizabeth’ and ‘Revenge’ (‘R’) classes, as well as three battle cruisers. All thirteen ships were armed with 15-inch guns. And although this decade is often depicted as a battleship-building ‘holiday’, the British Empire, uniquely, was granted an exemption. Its Navy was allowed to design and build two new battleships, armed with 16-inch guns and incorporating the lessons of Jutland; these were the Nelson and the Rodney (laid down in late 1922 and completed in 1927). Cruisers were very important to the Royal Navy – defensively, to protect trade, and offensively to enforce blockade. The Royal Navy constructed in the late 1920s, in competition with the US and Japan, a group of thirteen heavy cruisers, with a displacement of 10,000 tons and an armament of eight 8-inch guns; these were known as ‘treaty’ cruisers, because their specifications were based on the Washington Treaty upper limit. These were named after British counties; the first unit, laid down in October 1924 and completed in January 1928, was HMS Cumberland. In 1922 the Royal Navy had possessed fifty-six\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n15\n\ncruisers. Some fourteen of these had been disposed of as obsolete by 1930; the bulk of the remainder were thirty-five small ‘C’ and ‘D’ class cruisers of about 5,000 tons, built during World War I. The Washington Treaty had not limited the total cruiser tonnage in individual navies. Such a limit, however, was put into place in the London Naval Treaty, signed in April 1930 by Britain, the US and Japan. The British Empire was now allowed fifteen heavy cruisers (these were new ships already in commission) and 192,200 tons of light (6-inch gun) cruisers. The Royal Navy began to dispose of some of its existing light cruisers as they reached the fifteenyear replacement age. In the early 1930s, immediately after the London Treaty, some eleven light cruisers were built. These were armed with eight 6-inch guns in twin turrets. Their displacement of about 7,000 tons was 2,000 tons larger than the ‘C’ and ‘D’ class cruisers (built for World War I) which were being replaced, and the new ships were also better suited to oceanic operations. The state of affairs with regard to destroyers was similar. Britain had built a great number of these vessels during the 1914–18 war to support the Grand Fleet and to escort shipping. There was no need to build new flotillas in the 1920s. In 1922 the British Empire had 197 destroyers (including flotilla leaders), mostly launched in 1915–19; fifty-nine of these had been disposed of by the end of 1930.17 As with light cruisers, there was a potential problem of ‘block obsolescence’, too many identical units needing replacement at the same time. After the testing of a couple of experimental vessels in the mid-1920s, replacements began to be built in quantity. HMS Active was the first of these standard destroyers, part of a flotilla of eight; she was laid down in July 1928 and commissioned in February 1930. The 1930 London Treaty also set numerical limits on destroyer fleets for Britain, the US and Japan. The British and American limit was 150,000 tons, with individual ships capped at 1,500 tons. The Royal Navy built a flotilla (eight ships) or more a year; until 1937 these were the similar ‘A’ to ‘I’ classes. (These were matched by the disposal of seventy-four over-age destroyers in 1931–38.) In the 1930s, amidst a perfect storm of challenges, the achievement of adequate national defence became more difficult, A severe economic crisis began in 1930–31, leading to two episodes which touched the Royal Navy, the Invergordon Mutiny of 1931 (over naval pay) and the Jarrow March of 1936 (over closure of shipyards). The early 1930s saw Britain and the Royal Navy in a worse position, with the Navy Estimates (the annual budget) dropping to a low of £50.5 million in 1932–33. More important, external threats suddenly became greater, beginning with the Japanese occupation of northeastern China in September 1931, and followed in Europe by the creation of the nationalist Hitler government in Germany in January 1933, and the invasion of Ethiopia by\n\n16\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\nItaly in October 1935. Unlike in the 1920s, Britain now faced concrete threats, and increased expenditure on armaments had to be reconsidered in a time of straitened economic circumstances. However, the release of funds by the British government for rearmament in the winter of 1935–36 is less of a break than it is often described as, except in the building of battleships and large aircraft carriers. Even here, the construction of the 22,000-ton carrier Ark Royal had begun somewhat earlier, in September 1935. It is true that the laying down of new British capital ships was delayed by the 1930 London Naval Treaty until January 1937. The same treaty permitted the Italians to build replacement vessels, and two 35,000-ton battleships were laid down in Genoa and Trieste in October 1934. The Germans began work on their first (notionally) 35,000-ton ship (the Bismarck) in July 1936.18 (The Americans and Japanese, however, were even later in starting than the British, and did not lay down post-treaty battleships until October and November 1937, respectively.) In any event, there was a burst of activity in British shipyards in 1937. Two of a new class of battleship, the 35,000-ton King George V and Prince of Wales, were laid down on 1 January, the day the Washington Treaty quantitative limits expired. They were armed with ten 14-inch guns and capable of 28 knots. Three more of these vessels were laid down before the end of the summer of 1937, as were three 23,000-ton armoured aircraft carriers of the ‘Illustrious’ class; a fourth carrier began construction in November. What did not happen was a jump to a successor battleship class (of more than 35,000 tons), which the Germans, Americans and Japanese all succeeded in making. The projected ‘Lion’ class was an enlarged ‘King George V’ class, at 40,750 tons and armed with nine 16-inch guns. The first two were laid down in Liverpool and Newcastle in June and July 1939, but construction effectively ended with the outbreak of war; two more planned vessels were never even begun.19 On the other hand, the capital ship force was significantly strengthened by full-scale reconstruction (in 1934–40) of three of the older battleships, the Queen Elizabeth and her sister ships Valiant and Warspite, as well as the battle cruiser Renown. In addition a fifth armoured carrier was laid down in February 1939. Meanwhile cruiser construction had been accelerated with the laying down from late 1934 (again, before the winter of 1935–36) of ten large light cruisers of 9,000 to 10,000 tons with twelve 6-inch guns. (These were a response to four similar ‘Mogami’ class, begun by the Japanese in 1931.) The first of this ‘Town’ group, the Southampton, joined the fleet in March 1937. The ‘Towns’ were followed on the building slips from the autumn of 1937 by a class of eleven smaller (5,600-ton) ‘anti-aircraft cruisers’, designed to mount ten dual-purpose 5.25-inch guns.20\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n17\n\nConstruction of destroyers continued, with a new standard single-funnel type, beginning with the ‘J’ class. The first of these was the Jervis, begun in August 1937 and commissioned in May 1939. Alongside these were two flotillas (sixteen ships) of large and heavily-gunned ‘Tribal’ class destroyers, a response to the Japanese ‘Fubuki’ class; the first of the class (the Afridi) joined the fleet in May 1938. Britain entered the war with 176 destroyers, not many fewer than the number on hand in 1922; there were also thirty-one sloops, multi-purpose ships of nearly destroyer size. The majority of the destroyers were new ships built in the 1930s. The remainder were seventy ships left over from World War I construction, mostly of the ‘V’ and ‘W’ type. Although twenty years old, they would prove invaluable as convoy escorts during the Battle of the Atlantic. The shortcomings of the Royal Navy in the 1920s and 1930s are often exaggerated. There was, however, one critical problem, one which would dog the service through the first three or four years of the coming sea/air war and would only be resolved with extensive help from the United States. This was ‘naval’ aviation, involving both aircraft operating from carriers and maritime patrol aircraft (flying boats and landplanes) operating from shore bases.21 This was a weakness, both in absolute terms and relative to the two other biggest naval powers, the US and Japan. It was in many respects remarkable, as the Royal Navy had pioneered naval aviation during World War I with its Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). The RNAS brought into operation the first seaplane carrier (1914) and the first aircraft carrier (1917), and by the spring of 1918 it had been operating nearly 3,000 aircraft. The central long-term problem was an organisational one: the premature creation in April 1918 of the independent Royal Air Force (RAF), merging the RNAS and the Army’s Royal Flying Corps. Over more than two decades this structure had a pernicious effect on the capabilities of British armed forces over the sea (and also in combined-arms operations over land).22 As we will see, in both the US and Japan there was no independent air force, and the Army and Navy were each responsible for their own aircraft and aircrew; in particular, the navies kept control of carrier planes and some shore-based bombers and maritime patrol aircraft. The leaders of the new British RAF in the 1920s and 1930s were preoccupied with their ‘independent’ role – especially strategic bombing – and greatly exaggerated its war-winning potential. Their doctrine stressed the ‘indivisibility of air power’, which in their view should be entirely under the control of the Air Ministry. The senior admirals of the Royal Navy did understand, in general, the significance of aviation. On the other hand, one especially significant long-term effect of the 1918 reorganisation was that no influential group of middle- and seniorranking officers took shape in the Royal Navy which was able to champion\n\n18\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\nnaval aviation; flying was also not an advantageous career path for able junior officers. In the navies of the US and Japan, such men were present at various levels, including the top rank, despite the predominant influence of the battleship traditionalists even there. In the Royal Navy, ‘big-gun’ admirals of the surface navy met less competition in terms of allocation of resources and development of overall naval doctrine and planning. All the same, the Admiralty did eventually push hard to regain control of the shipboard aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm (FAA).23 After years of controversy, including a threat of resignation by Admiral Ernle Chatfield, the First Sea Lord, the British government gave in to Admiralty pressure in 1937 and agreed to restore the aircraft and flying personnel of the carriers to the Navy. The takeover process, however, continued through to May 1939, and the government rejected the Admiralty’s request for the transfer of the shore-based maritime aircraft and personnel of RAF Coastal Command. Despite the administrative arrangements for aircraft in the 1920s and 1930s the Admiralty held onto responsibility for the design and construction of ships to carry these planes. Three large aircraft carriers were in the fleet by the end of the 1920s, converted from battle cruisers built for World War I; these were the Furious, the Courageous and the Glorious.24 As already mentioned, a new large fleet carrier was begun in 1935 (the Ark Royal), and the first four ‘armoured’ fleet carriers in 1937 (the Illustrious, the Victorious, the Formidable and the Indomitable). The Ark Royal was commissioned in December 1938 and the Illustrious, the first of the armoured carriers, would enter operational service in August 1940. These new fleet carriers made up the largest carrier programme anywhere in the world, exceeding those of the US and Japan.25 The primary weakness of the British forces for sea/air operations – with hindsight and relative to its rivals – lay not with the ships but with aircraft. The machines on hand were second-rate, and there were too few of them. On the outbreak of war in September 1939 the Royal Navy possessed only 410 aircraft, about half of which were shipborne. In July of that year the US Navy had 2,098 aircraft on hand, including 1,316 combat types. As for the Japanese, even at the end of 1937 their Navy outnumbered the FAA, with 332 carrier planes and 563 shore-based planes.26 There was also a technical limitation, in that the number of aircraft deployed on each British carrier was low, typically about thirty on the older carriers and only forty-five on the Ark Royal, compared to about twice that number aboard contemporary American carriers, which normally carried between seventy-five and eighty aircraft.27 A consequence of these low numbers was low quality. Ordering small batches of high-performance aircraft meant a very high unit cost. Attempts were made to order multi-purpose aircraft, but these tended to be inadequate in each role.\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n19\n\nThe quality of existing and projected Royal Navy carrier aircraft was low. Famously, for better or for worse, the Fleet Air Arm of the first years of World War II is remembered for (successful) small-scale attacks by the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber, a biplane with an open cockpit and fixed undercarriage, and a maximum speed of about 140 mph. Torpedo bombers were regarded by all three major navies as important, as only they could sink, or at least slow down, heavily armoured capital ships. By 1938 both the Americans and the Japanese had in service monoplane torpedo bombers, with enclosed cockpits and retractable landing gear; the Douglas TBD and the Nakajima B5N (later code-named kate) were at least 65 mph faster than the Swordfish. Outmoded torpedo bombers were only the most visible weakness. The Admiralty had accepted, well before the outbreak of the war, the importance of the dive bomber for attacking carriers and smaller warships. Although such an aircraft would have been extremely valuable against the Axis navies (especially in the Mediterranean), the Royal Navy had only procured a small number of Blackburn Skuas, a dual-role fighter-dive bomber. This type carried a 500lb bomb, but was slow and was withdrawn from front-line service in 1941. The most successful dive bomber of the sea/air war in European waters would certainly be the shore-based Junkers Ju 87 Stuka of the Luftwaffe. By the beginning of 1941 the air groups of the American and the Japanese carriers included modern dive bombers, and they would be used extensively in the Pacific war.28 Torpedo planes and dive bombers could also be used for bombing land targets like airfields and ports, and the small number available in 1939–42 lowered the potential of the Royal Navy’s carriers. Fleet air defence was another vital function of carrier aircraft. The 1930s was a time of very rapid technical change in aviation, and the air forces of potential enemies developed fast all-metal twin-engined bombers. The Heinkel He 111 had a top speed of 270 mph and the Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 a top speed of 285 mph; the new German Schnellbomber, the Junkers Ju 88, could reach 315 mph. All three types would have a major sea/air role from 1939–40 onwards. The RAF had developed excellent new single-seat interceptors like the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire to operate from its land bases, but the situation aboard the Royal Navy carrier force was much less favourable. A small batch of a ‘navalised’ version of an older RAF fighter was ordered as a stop-gap; this was the Gloster Sea Gladiator, a single-seat biplane.29 When it ordered new monoplane fighters after 1937, the Admiralty also insisted on a second crew member responsible for over-sea navigation and communications. The maximum speed of the Sea Gladiator was only 260 mph; that of the two-seat Skua was only 225 mph. Such aircraft would have difficulty intercepting modern fast bombers, and they were incapable of effectively engaging modern shore-based fighters like\n\n20\n\nSEA POWER AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\n\nthe Messerschmitt Bf 109. Small numbers of these second-rate aircraft were all that the Fleet Air Arm could operate in the first year of the war. It was only in the winter of 1940–41 that a limited quantity of better carrier fighters became available – by acquiring the Grumman G-36 (F4F) from the US, and a navalised version of the Hurricane.30 Experience later in the war made it clear that the systems for developing and procuring carrier aircraft (at least from British industry) remained poor; this was in marked contrast to the navies of the US and Japan. Indeed in the course of the whole coming war only two modern purpose-built British-designed carrier planes would enter service.31 Carrier aircraft were only the most obvious weakness of British maritime aviation. The RAF had failed before September 1939 to procure an effective shorebased patrol or attack force for operations over the sea. In this respect, however, the British position was not so bad relative to the Americans, or, to a degree, to the Japanese.32 The patrol aircraft ordered in largest quantity before 1939 was the Avro Anson, which was small, and had short-range and very limited anti-ship and antisubmarine (A/S) abilities. The RAF did develop and procure before the war a big four-engined flying boat, the Short Sunderland, based on the Empire civilian flying boat. However, belated and half-hearted attempts to order twin-engined shore-based torpedo bombers and a medium-sized (twin-engined) flying boat for RAF Coastal Command ended in technical failure.33 This shortage was only addressed on the eve of the outbreak of war by ordering patrol planes from US manufacturers, the Lockheed Model 14 Hudson and the Consolidated (Model 28) PBY Catalina flying boat, but only the Hudson was available in any numbers in the first period of the war. Fortunately shore-based RAF medium (twin-engined) and heavy (four-engined) bombers would eventually be used in the maritime patrol and A/S role, as well as B-17 Fortress and B-24 Liberator four-engined bombers acquired from the US. This, however, would not take place until 1942. All this meant that the British had limited ability to use shore-based aircraft for anti-invasion (in Britain in 1940, Malaya in 1941 and Ceylon in 1942) or anti-submarine operations (until 1942). In what would turn out to be a sea/air war this weakness would prove very telling, at least from the spring of 1940. Despite the shortcomings of naval aviation, the Royal Navy was at the heart of national strategy for most of the 1920s and 1930s. Latterly the RAF budget increased, but only at the end of the 1930s did it surpass that of the Navy. If there was a Cinderella service it was the British Army. When Britain began to accelerate rearmament in 1936 the emphasis was on home defence and imperial defence rather than on a major ‘continental commitment’. For better or for worse, only in February 1939 would it become a priority to raise ground forces that could directly support Britain’s French ally against Nazi Germany.\n\nTHE TWILIGHT WAR\n\n21\n\nThe Allies were in some ways militarily unprepared in September 1939, but they were economically more powerful than Germany. Their expectation was that once they had caught up with the armaments programme of the Third Reich they could begin decisive operations. As things turned out, they seriously underestimated the energy and skill of their opponent.\n\nTHE FIRST SEA/AIR BATTLES The fighting on land and in the air in the first six months of the war had little effect on the British and French. The Germans attacked Poland with greatly superior ground and air forces; Warsaw fell on 27 September, bringing an effective end to the fighting. The French made no more than a token offensive effort with their army in the west, although they and the British built up their ground forces. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent across the Channel in September and October 1939 without interference from the enemy. A short-lived little naval war took place in the Baltic. The Kriegsmarine actually fired the first shots by German forces, on 1 September. The old battleship Schleswig-Holstein bombarded a Polish enclave below Danzig at th"
