        "text": "ALONE IN THE SNOW Sweden's neutrality lasted only as long as the Reformed Russian Republic had no need of anything that Sweden had and not a moment longer. The determined resistance of the United States' 1st Special Forces put the R3 theatre commander behind schedule by 36 hours. Behind schedule has never been a comfortable place for a Russian Commander and this commander was determined to be uncomfortable only for a very short period of time. His plan to get things moving again involved turning Norway's southern flank. But, in order to do that, staging bases closer than Germany were required. Unfortunately for Sweden, bases that fit the bill were Swedish. The remaining life of Sweden's neutrality was measured in hours. NATO wanted to provide assistance. The problem was, other than providing advanced warning of the attack, NATO had nothing to give. The few remaining Norwegian F-16s could not be re-oriented to cover Swedish airspace without leaving the northern FEBA vulnerable. CENTAF simply had no aircraft to spare. RAF operational reserves had been released to guard the northern approaches to the UK. The German air force ceased to exist as an effective fighting force 90 seconds after the first shots were fired. Combined chemical, biological, and conventional missile, artillery, and air attacks have a tendency to do that. Although alone in the snow, the Swedes were not without hope. Sweden had been neutral. Sweden had not been stupid. Sweden's defense expenditures had increased from 2.9% of GNP in 1987 to 4.5% of GNP in 1996. A large portion of that money was spent on the procurement of Viggens, Sweden's latest multi-role fighter aircraft. It was with the Viggens that this battle would turn. Author: Herman Hum GUARDIAN The events leading to the reformation of the old Soviet Union were numerous, anticipated by many, observed by many more, fatal for some and potentially deadly for the world. But famine, civil unrest, martial law, and dictators almost always are. The Reformed Russian Republic was neither reformed nor a republic. But it was Russian. Very Russian. Seventeen months after the Marshals dissolved the Politburo, shot the President, and invited the Supreme Soviet to reconvene in a much cooler climate; the military machine that had been built by paranoid fathers and unleashed by older, misguided brothers was freed and pointed west. The time had come for the investment in tanks, ships, and aircraft to be redeemed. Since the initiation of hostilities on 4 Feb, 1997, the R3 navy has enjoyed great success. Naval aviation attacks on Keflavik paved the way for a successful airborne assault. Andoya and Bodo in Norway soon followed. With newly liberated air bases allowing almost full coverage of the North Sea, the waters and skies north of England have become very unfriendly for Allied ships and aircraft. All of NATO's carriers and most NATO major surface combatants have been withdrawn to the North Atlantic to ensure the security of the sea lanes of communication. NATO command was willing to trade control of the North Sea for a period of time for a much better chance of getting the convoys of troops, tanks, and munitions that CENTAG would require across the grey seas from America to Europe. Protection of NATO's north-eastern flank has fallen primarily to air power. Of the northern NATO bases, only Stornoway has remained operational. NATO's other air bases have fallen victim to standoff attacks from the Keflavik Bears, Badgers, and Backfires or to R3 surface action groups. NATO command's decision to re-deploy the majority of US air assets to bases in southern England to better support CENTAG has left only the RAF. The Air Vice-Marshall released the remaining reserves of the 41st Squadron and the 12th Squadron to provide tactical flexibility. A credible strike force could be mounted from Stornoway. Original author: Delwin Hinkle\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum IN EVERY CLIME AND PLACE The war between the CIS and NATO has been raging for three weeks with the CIS gaining the upper hand with their swift conquest of the nations surrounding the Norwegian Sea. Gaining access to the Atlantic in this manner, many of their hunter-killer submarine groups have been able to sortie thus harassing NATO convoys and wreaking havoc with NATO's wartime plans. SACEur has had enough and finally convinces the USN to launch an amphibious invasion of Norway to stop the flow of subs that are sinking his supplies! In order to pull off such a daring invasion, a CVBG is pulled from escort duty and ordered to soften up the air power that the CIS has built up in Norway. The USN also pulls together all of its newest ships in the 'Gator navy. Finally, the AV-8B Harrier II+ is embarked on the Wasp-class ships. This will prove to be its debut in combat. There is little time left for NATO. At the rate the CIS subs are sinking convoys, NATO won't last another two weeks. This invasion must be successful! Author: Herman Hum WATCH THAT FIRST STEP LOCATION : NW PACIFIC, COASTAL SEATTLE\n\nDATE/TIME: 12 FEBRUARY 1985, 06:00:00 ZULU With the first war shots, DEFCON ONE status was automatic. Every submarine in the inventory that was capable of getting underway left port for the greater safety of the open sea. Only those boats with mechanical deficiencies remained docked, to leave when their problems were fixed. As a part of standing plans, all the assets of the United States Coast Guard were folded into the Navy's TOE, to be employed in such a way as to free regular Navy assets for higher priority missions. Their mission: sanitize the area around the sub bases, allowing the remaining subs to get to open water. AIR LANE RAIDERS LOCATION : GUAM\n\nDATE/TIME: 12 FEBRUARY 1985, 18:00:00 ZULU In response to building tensions before the outbreak of actual shooting, CINCPAC executed standing plans to enhance the ELINT capabilities of Guam. The transit schedule for the personnel of the units and members of CINPAC's staff was not hard to obtain and the PACRIM was presented with an opportunity to cripple both a critical ELINT unit and CINCPAC's staff with one blow. For the U.S. commander, the objective will be to escort the ELINT unit through a Soviet air blockade. FISH IN A BARREL LOCATION : RED SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 4 MAY 1985, 03:00:00 ZULU As the tensions with India increased, U.S. Forces began redeploying the Carrier Battle Group operating in the Mediterranean through the Red Sea and into the Indian Ocean. What was usually a peaceful transition went terribly wrong. An S-3 on a standard patrol ahead of the Battle Group picked up multiple large objects floating in the approaches out of the Red Sea. On closer examination they turned out to be mines; very sophisticated, variable-depth captor-like mines. As the Battle Group turned, something even more surprising occurred. Two large cargo vessels exploded almost simultaneously, blocking the Suez Canal. The American Battle Group was now stuck in a very small ocean. The only potentially hostile nation capable of developing such a mine was the Soviet Union. The tensions with India and the sudden explosion of war with the Soviets have caught an U.S. Carrier Battle Group in a bad place -- transiting the Red Sea. The Soviets and the Egyptians have each mined one end of the Sea, leaving no exit. BLACK SEA SURPRISE LOCATION : BLACK SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 20 May 1985, 02:00:00 Zulu World wide systems analysts have unanimously agreed that NATO Forces were at least 2 generations ahead of the Soviets in command and control systems. Stolen technical materials confirmed the limited processing power of Soviet tactical computer systems. No one in the West could have predicted the almost seamless operation of Soviet offensive forces. NATO has devoted considerable assets to uncover the secret to their advanced operations. Soviet Black Sea Forces have been operating in an extremely coordinated manner. Their C3I Network has performed better than expected. An obvious conclusion that can be drawn is that somewhere, not far away, a very large and powerful computer center is crunching numbers very rapidly. A very high value target indeed. CAR CARRIER CONVOYS LOCATION : COASTAL JAPAN/WESTERN PACIFIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 FEBRUARY 1985, 02:00:00 Predictably, when the opening shots of the Pacific Rim War were fired, merchants of all the involved countries - and a great number of neutrals - began to scream for protection. Having taken the lessons of the last World War to heart, Japan knew that the lanes of commerce to the home islands were particularly vulnerable to the threat of submarine attack. The challenge would be to quickly gather the merchants into something at least resembling a convoy, while avoiding losing either the civilian ships or any of their ASW platforms to the PACRIM submarine forces. END RUN LOCATION : COASTAL CUBA/HAITI/FLORIDA\n\nDATE/TIME: 01 SEPTEMBER 1985, 10:00:00 ZULU Cuba has a long history of providing troops to augment the forces of other Communist states. Only recently, however, was Cuba implicated in acts of international terrorism. In the space of a single week, which was proclaimed Siete Dias del Diablo (Seven Days of the Devil) by Castro, more than a dozen acts of terrorism, including bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations aimed at U.S. citizens and interests around the world, were carried out by Cuban-led hit squads. In response, the President of the United States requested from Congress the authority to declare a 100-mile maritime exclusion zone around Cuba. In simultaneous session, both Houses of Congress approved the request in less than an hour. No official response was forthcoming from Moscow, but a SAG centered on the Kirov changed course toward Cuba and has entered the exclusion zone. BRING ALONG SOME FRIENDS LOCATION : EASTERN ATLANTIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 01:00:00 ZULU The war has entered its second month, and the Soviets are exploiting their early gains. Control of Iceland has allowed Soviet surface ships to slip into the North Atlantic to attack convoys of troops and supplies headed for Europe. This scenario will highlight Harpoon II's ability to model theoretical units. The ARAPAHO program was at its peak in the mid-1980s and was discontinued because it was seen as a superfluous system for the needs of the time. However, at a time of global naval warfare, such a system would indeed be very valuable for the U.S. Navy. ENEMY ON ISLAND LOCATION : NORTH ATLANTIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 FEBRUARY 1985, 04:00:00 ZULU Soviet Backfire and Badger bombers have pummelled the military facilities on Iceland, and the main amphibious assault is about to begin. There are very limited resources available to counter the landing because of tremendous pressures being applied by the Soviets and their allies. There is no hope that the landing can be stopped, only that it can be delayed or crippled. It is DAY 3 of the war, and the Soviets are grabbing territory they can use for negotiating chips. MIDWAY REVISITED LOCATION : CENTRAL PACIFIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 MARCH 1985, 18:00:00 ZULU At least one PACRIM SAG is loose in the Pacific. Centered on the Kirov-class cruiser Frunze, this powerful group must be eliminated quickly. CINCPAC has ordered the Kitty Hawk battle group to locate and engage the Frunze SAG as soon as possible. No additional air support is available, although runways and refuelling/rearming facilities at Midway remain operational. This will be a race to get to Midway, winner takes all. BATTLE OF THE NORTH SEA LOCATION : NORTH SEA aa\n\nDATE/TIME: 22 AUGUST 1985, 06:00:00 ZULU Warsaw Pact occupation of Denmark and Norway has opened the North Sea to the smaller Warsaw Pact units that normally operated in the Baltic. Each side has occupied and armed several of the oil and gas rigs which dot the North Sea, protecting vital energy sources. Each side raids the other's fields, and a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse ensues among the giant platforms. REINFORCING THE NORTHERN FLANK LOCATION : COASTAL NORWEGIAN WATERS\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 FEBRUARY 1985, 02:00:00 ZULU This scenario occurs just as the war starts, with the NATO player trying to reinforce positions along the coast of Norway, and the Soviet player setting off what will become a long war. This scenario shows us the results of pitting a low-end CTOL carrier against a CVHG, and how the planes perform against each other. TREMORS LOCATION : California Coastline\n\nDATE/TIME: 14 February 1985, 02:00:00 ZULU A major component of any successful offensive operation is the element of surprise. To achieve surprise during the Cold War, long term planning and careful execution have to be the order of the day. The sudden outbreak of war has left many Cargo Vessels at sea without protection. Soviet attack submarines deployed just before the commencement of hostilities have positioned themselves perfectly. Lightly armed trawlers are also creating havoc. VISIT TO VALDEZ LOCATION : Alaskan Territory\n\nDATE/TIME: 6 July 1985, 15:00:00 ZULU America now finds itself in much the same position as pre World War II Japan, depending heavily on the import of raw materials, mainly oil. Soviet submarine forces have managed to stop, at least in the short term, the supply of crude oil from the Persian Gulf. Every drop of domestic production is now critical to the operation of America's Military and Industrial Complex. Should America's domestic supply be interrupted even for a short time, it could force the Americans to negotiate a Peace Treaty very favourable to the Soviet Union. VIETNAM ESCORT LOCATION : Western Pacific\n\nDATE/TIME: 20 April 1985, 13:00:00 ZULU The Vietnamese government has announced a 200 mile territorial limit off the Coast and has begun seizing the merchantmen in transit between Bangkok and Hong Kong. The Soviet Union immediately announced support for the seizures and has agreed to assist the local Government in enforcing its new boundaries. Most of the seized vessels have been returned to their owners after large \"transit fees\" have been arranged. The United States and the United Kingdom have vowed to reopen the sea lanes. BATTLE OF THE WESTERN APPROACHES LOCATION : North Atlantic\n\nDATE/TIME: 8 December 1985, 05:00:00 Zulu The war has dragged on into winter, and the loss of the North Sea oil and gas rigs is causing an energy crisis in Europe. The extra mouths to feed are also putting a severe strain on food supplies. NATO is required to force convoys through to keep food on the table and keep the population from freezing. A convoy carrying natural gas, fuel, and food is enroute to Liverpool. Iceland is still held by the Soviets, although constant attacks have somewhat weakened the forces operating from the island. ASSAULT ON ZION PLO VS ISRAEL LOCATION : EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 19 JANUARY 1995, 06:00:00 ZULU Although the Israeli government and the PLO had signed a Peace Accord in 1993, by late 1994 it was obvious that little had changed. PLO hardliners continued to launch attacks from Lebanon and Southern Syria in an attempt to force Israel to compromise by giving up more land. Israeli counterattacks, especially into Syria, aroused the ire of the Syrian President, which led him to covertly support PLO naval training in conjunction with Syrian naval personnel. PLO personnel trained intensively as \"Syrians\" for their first real \"naval\" assault on Israel. The struggle between Israel and Palestinians is far from over, peace accord or not. Both sides have their radical factions who are not happy with the accords, and are willing to use violence to force change on the Israeli government. Syria has been a long-time backer of the PLO, including the hard-line factions that commit terrorist actions. The backing includes money, training facilities, and equipment for the terrorists to use. For Israel, there is a constant threat of attack from land and sea. Despite increased naval patrol activity, the volume of civilian traffic in the area increases the chance of successful infiltrations by terrorist units. TAKING OF THE BLACK SEA FLEET RUSSIA VS UKRAINE LOCATION : BLACK SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 10 JULY 1994, 02:48:00 ZULU By the summer of 1994, the Russian government had grown weary of continued negotiations with the Ukrainian government over the final fate of the Black Sea fleet. Since the break-up of the former Soviet Union in 1991, the Ukrainians dragged their feet over the issue of fleet control. At risk was control of over 100 significant combatants, paid for by the former Soviet Union. Because of the split, experienced technicians and spare parts became scarce, forcing the majority of the fleet to remain at pier side, deteriorating from neglect. Several agreements had been reached, but no final settlement or arbitration had ever come about. The Russians have decided that such a major investment (which could be sold for profit if serviceable) can not be allowed to rust away. A plan has been formulated, operation \"Trojan Horse,\" which will allow the Russian government to reclaim its \"lost\" property. A major fleet exercise has been scheduled for November 1994, to be combined with a fleet visit to Sevastopol to \"show the flag.\" Initially the Ukrainians are delighted their Russian naval counterparts were going to visit, perhaps even helping to restore some of the ships. On the 10th of July, 1994, they realize their error, perhaps too late. BREAK THE BLOCKADE BRITAIN VS EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY LOCATION : NORTH SEA & ENGLISH CHANNEL\n\nDATE/TIME: 20 APRIL 1995, 09:00:00 ZULU With the collapse of the major world powers' economies in late 1994, the European Economic Community (EEC) was left in a precarious position. As long as the EEC acted together, it would emerge as the new economic powerhouse in the world. There was one problem though -- Great Britain. For years, the British had resisted a total union with Europe because it meant surrendering a large part of their national sovereignty. In order to protect their unstable economic status, the EEC decreed that the British convert their economic system and fold their currency into the new \"European Dollar\". The British refused and withdrew from the EEC. The EEC immediately voted to force the British back into the union, by force if necessary. After a series of heated debates and several at-sea incidents, the French and German governments decided on a blockade to force the recalcitrant British back into the EEC. The British, realizing their national sovereignty and heritage were at stake, issued a general call-up and sortied the Royal Navy. Off the southern coastline of Great Britain, two of the EEC task forces holding the blockade have set up anti-ship patrol regions. The EEC forces currently control the waterways from the Atlantic, thru the Dover Straights, to the southern reaches of the North Sea. To break this part of the blockade, the British have mustered two task forces. Their objective was before them - break the EEC hold on the seas south of Great Britain, securing the waterways for British shipping traffic. BLOOD FEUD CHINA VS TAIWAN LOCATION : STRAIT OF TAIWAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 27 NOVEMBER 1994, 17:00:00 ZULU The economic turmoil in the West, the rise of Japan in the Far East, and the collapse of the former Soviet Union forced the Chinese to accelerate their extensive military modernization program. In addition to the modernizing of the military, a new style of aggressive Chinese leadership began to supplant the \"Old Guard\". By late 1994, China stood ready to take back \"what already belonged to them\". Taiwan had been preparing for the worst since the onset of the collapse of the world market in 1994. They knew that war with mainland China was inevitable and had been preparing for that eventuality since early 1994. Aggressive naval patrolling by the Taiwanese had prevented several attempted infiltrations by the Chinese Special Forces. The Chinese realized that the straits had to be secured from any Taiwanese Naval units before any invasion fleets could cross. They set out to accomplish that goal on November 27th, 1994. A NAVAL BORDER WAR ECUADOR VS PERU LOCATION : GULF OF GUAYAQUIL\n\nDATE/TIME: 30 SEPTEMBER 1994, 19:00:00 With the attention of the world focused on economic upheaval, and the inability of the United Nations to deal with conflicts around the globe, some smaller nations decided this was the time to act. Animosities that had lain dormant for decades came to the forefront. Ecuador and Peru had fought a series of small \"wars\" over the exact demarcation of their mutual border. At stake was a seemingly unimportant strip of worthless land, that is, until a huge oil bearing rock formation was discovered directly beneath the border. Both nations desperately needed to exploit the oil deposit to bolster their sagging economies. Although both nations called on the U.N. to mediate their border crisis, a series of small border clashes has erupted into full scale war. Neither side has been able to gain the advantage. In order to break the stalemate, the Peruvian High Command has ordered the Peruvian Navy to close the key port of Guayaquil. This would stop all resupply of Ecuadorean Army units and lead to victory. DAWN PATROL NORWAY VS RUSSIA LOCATION : COASTAL NORWEGIAN WATERS\n\nDATE/TIME: 17 OCTOBER 1994, 05:00:00 ZULU In this remake of the now-classic Harpoon scenario, two missile boat squadrons encounter each other in a fast-paced meeting engagement off the rocky Norwegian coastline. Perhaps more than any other scenario offered in Harpoon, this engagement most dramatically illustrates the fundamental principles of modern naval combat: 1. Because each combatant has enough firepower to sink three opponents, missile combat tends to be sudden and violent. 2. Once events get ahead of you and you're behind 'the curve', you will be condemned to playing catch-up. Get ahead early! 3. Attack effectively first. A FIGHT TO THE DEATH RUSSIA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : NORTH ATLANTIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 19 DECEMBER 1994, 12:00:00 ZULU With aircraft carriers being sold (as scrap) for $10.00 per ton, the spectre of an all-out NATO vs. Pact war no longer seems so realistic. However, much debate and speculation on the outcome of such a conflict still seems to hold much interest and attention. To satisfy this historical curiosity, we have crafted just such a scenario for all of the whimsical what-if students, such that they may seek their own answer to this question. This scenario is balanced only in that the Russian side is given a fairly new complement of equipment along with access to SNA assets based at Keflavik Air Station (assumed to be in Russian hands). The US CVBG is pared down to match early 1990's proposed force-level cuts as well as platform retirements. INCHON AGAIN S. KOREA/UNITED STATES VS N. KOREA LOCATION : YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 6 AUGUST 1994, 05:00:00 ZULU The war has begun. The North Korean Army, almost a million strong, has swarmed over the DMZ and is rapidly pushing south. The ROK army has inflicted hideous losses on PRK forces, but the overwhelming numbers cannot be stayed. Seoul, expected to fall within hours, has held out instead for three weeks. Inside the shrinking perimeter, the besieged US 2nd Infantry Division fights for its life. Since Japan is withholding use of its airfields while the Diet decides if they may legally intervene, US air power must fly from Okinawa and cannot make its full strength felt. Now the US Marine Corps has arrived to relieve Seoul... But can they get through in time? OPERATION LIGHTNING BOLT SOUTH AFRICA VS C.I.S. LOCATION : COASTAL SOUTH AFRICA, INDIAN OCEAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 1 OCTOBER 1994, 05:00:00 ZULU As the world economies became more unstable, the continuing regional conflicts around the globe increased the demand for high quality, low cost weaponry. Russia, as a means of raising capital to fund efforts to end bloody border conflicts with neighbouring republics, decided that some of its naval units could be sold on the world markets. Such opportunities came to the attention of the ruling party in Mozambique. The conflicts between the ANC and existing South African government agencies have endured steadfastly, despite several campaigns to end the bloodshed. By way of aiding their ANC brothers to the south, Mozambique purchased five warships from the Russian government to be used in military efforts to bring about the downfall of the current regime in South Africa. Because the arrival of the ex-Russian units would tip the scale towards the ANC, the South African government decided that their destruction was a critical priority. MALVINAS PART II ARGENTINA VS BRITAIN LOCATION : MALVINAS ISLANDS\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 MAY 1995, 11:00:00 ZULU On April 1st, 1995, a large force of Argentinean commandos, supported by air strikes and naval gunfire attacked the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands. After 3 days of bitter hand to hand fighting, the Royal Marine garrison was annihilated. Immediately, the Argentineans set forth to fortify the islands against assault. The British, appalled by the blatant use of force, decided to retake their sovereign territory. The U.N. Security Council, while providing no forces to help, gave the British assurances that the British NATO forces could be temporarily withdrawn to be used in the campaign. On May 15th, 1995, the first elements of the British fleet arrived in the war zone. Combat was imminent. OKINAWA JAPAN VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : OKINAWA\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 MARCH 1995, 18:00:00 ZULU As the Western economies continued towards collapse, Japan moved forward in its desire to re-assert dominance in the Far East. In order to force the United States to relinquish its forward bases in the Pacific, the Japanese military moved into action. A naval and air blockade was placed around Okinawa Island. The U.S. government, backed by strong public opinion, decided to respond with a show of military force. The Japanese, knowing they could not stand toe-to-toe with the U.S. Navy, decided the best option would be to operate within range of their land based aircraft. They hoped that preventing the resupply of Okinawa, and, in the course of maintaining the blockade, inflicting significant losses on the U.S. Navy, would cause the U.S. government to reconsider their claims on Okinawa. OPERATION RATCATCHER SWEDEN VS UNKNOWN SUBMARINES LOCATION : COASTAL SWEDEN, NORTH ATLANTIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 20 DECEMBER 1994, 12:00:00 ZULU During the late '70s and early '80s, a large number of unknown submerged contacts plagued the Swedish navy. Although one Soviet Whiskey class sub was caught, many other intruders escaped. The break-up of the Soviet Union should have lessened the frequency of intruders. However, the unknown contacts continued to stymie the best efforts of the Swedish armed forces. The Swedish military has decided that an aggressive defense of Swedish territorial waters is the best way to deter future intruders. Orders were issued to all fleet units that the Swedish bases of Karlskrona and Solvesborg were to be protected with a maximum use of force. TO PROTECT THE QUEEN BRITAIN VS RUSSIA LOCATION : NORTH SEA AND ENGLISH CHANNEL\n\nDATE/TIME: 12 DECEMBER 1994, 05:00:00 ZULU In the fall of 1993, the Russian dam burst. The Russian government, beset by a bitter civil war supported by various Western nations, was desperate to find a way to end the conflict. Any hopes of peace went up in a nuclear fireball when the rebels, backed by the West, found a way to launch an SS-25 ICBM at Moscow. It was estimated that over 1 million people perished in the blast and ensuing radiation. The Russian government, blaming Great Britain for the incident, mustered all available naval forces to destroy the British navy and \"punish the war loving British people.\" Although lacking the resources to invade Britain, the Russian government believed that with the Royal Navy destroyed, they would be able to attack key British cities and then dictate terms to the government. With the European Community and the United States busy with other crises around the globe, the British stood alone. January 1st, 1994, a general mobilization call was issued. War was imminent. With the current Russian government in shambles and the military in the driver's seat, one could well imagine a return to the \"old days.\" Both Russia and the other Republics have blamed the West for supporting rebel forces within the former Soviet Union. Nuclear weapons control has been a key issue recently, with the Russian government making repeated assurances that none of their over 30,000 nuclear weapons are loose. THE TAKING OF SAKHALIN JAPAN VS RUSSIA LOCATION : SEA OF JAPAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 31 OCTOBER 1994, 19:00:00 ZULU For the victorious and the defeated alike, the end of World War II saw the reshaping of national borders around the globe. Just beyond the northern border of today's Japan, off the eastern coast of Kamchatka, lies the island of Sakhalin. Prior to the war, this island marked the northernmost reach of Japan. Today it does not. Over the past few years, the Japanese and Russian governments have been haggling over the return of Sakhalin Island to Japanese control. Neither side has been willing to compromise on true control of the island. For the Japanese, it is a matter of national pride and economic exploitation. For the Russians, it is a matter of national defense, as the length of the island spans two vital chokepoints and provides a buffer for the naval base at Vladivostok. The last channels of negotiation have been broken off. The government of Japan has issued an ultimatum: leave the island or be thrown off. The Japanese are mobilizing. The Russians are on alert. The world is watching. WHITE DEATH CHILE VS ARGENTINA LOCATION : ANTARCTIC PENINSULA\n\nDATE/TIME: 20 JANUARY 1995, 08:00:00 ZULU With the industrialized nations of the world struggling to put their economies back on track after the crash of 1994, most South American countries were on their own economically. Faced with the hard fact that Western aid was no longer available, national well-being hinged on the availability of petroleum products. The Chilean government formed several expeditions to explore the Antarctic region in search of new oil reserves. The discovery of the \"Allende\" field, with over 20 billion barrels of recoverable oil, sent shock waves through the South American economic community. The Chileans announced that a final survey, to determine the boundaries of the massive oil field was to be carried out immediately. The Argentineans, through a preliminary survey of their own, found that the field was exclusively in Chilean territory. This situation would lead to Chilean ownership of the region and a crippling blow to the Argentinean plans for regional dominance. The Argentinean High Command decided to stop the Chilean survey before the results were announced. THOSE FUTILE FJORDS NORWAY VS RUSSIA LOCATION : COASTAL NORWEGIAN WATERS\n\nDATE/TIME: 8 DECEMBER 1994, 12:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The 2nd week of the war finds the Soviets in control of most of the major population centers in Norway. Surviving elements of the Norwegian Air Force that were able, fled to Iceland or the United Kingdom. Those caught on the ground destroyed their machines. The Norwegian Navy was also forced to abandon their bases and is now hiding up and down the coast using the many fjords to mask their positions. In many respects, the Soviet's problems are just beginning. HIGHWAY TO HAIFA SOVIETS/SYRIA VS UNITED STATES/ISRAEL LOCATION : MEDITERANEAN SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 10 JANUARY 1995, 19:15:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The weight of the Soviet forces have done what the Arabs by themselves could not do, break the back of the Israeli Defense Force. Large pockets of resistance still exist at Haifa and Tel Aviv. It is expected that they can hold out for the next 7 to 10 days. Supplies are the key to life. To make the situation even more tense, Syria has begun mobilizing its air forces in what could prove to be a final blow to Israel. The United States and NATO have provided Israel with more aircraft as a deterrent for any further attacks by the Soviets. Will it be too little, too late? HUNTERS SOVIETS VS UNITED KINGDOM LOCATION : NORTH SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 6 NOVEMBER 1993, 12:30:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The war is now a few hours old and Soviet submarines pre-positioned prior to the commencement of hostilities are now wreaking havoc in the North Sea. NATO alert ASW forces are responding in force. The Soviets will have to escalate the pace of operations if they expect to maximize the element of surprise. Most RAF #11 Group interceptors have been committed to the defense of the NATO central front. The next 72 hours are critical. ATTACK ON KAMCHATKA UNITED STATES VS SOVIETS LOCATION : SEA OF OKHOTSK\n\nDATE/TIME: 7 APRIL 1993, 12:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: Prior to the commencement of hostilities, many academics debated the soundness of U.S. multi-carrier attacks against heavily defended enemy Naval Forces conducting a \"Bastion\" defense. The debate is over. U.S. strategy has been successful. The aftermath of this large scale Naval engagement has left most of the Soviet Pacific Fleet at the bottom of the Sea of Okhotsk. The surviving Surface Forces are making best speed back to Petropavlovsk. U.S. Forces, although suffering some casualties, have maintained cohesion and are now poised to press their advantage. BATTLE FOR KHUZESTAN - PART 1 IRANIANS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF\n\nDATE/TIME: 8 DECEMBER 1993, 08:30:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: Satellite photos have picked up 2 Motor Rifle Divisions enroute to the Iranian capital. One from the northwest through the Talis Mountains. The other from the northeast through the Elburz Mountains. The same satellite pass showed a large Iranian concentration of force in the northeast indicating they are aware of the Eastern Soviet Force but appear to be withdrawing forces from the northwest. The U.S. Navy must now force itself on the Iranians to save their western flank. BATTLE FOR KHUZESTAN (PT.2) SOVIETS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF\n\nDATE/TIME: 12 DECEMBER 1990, ZULU OVERVIEW: Growing Soviet Air activity has forced U.S. Naval Forces to withdraw from the Persian Gulf and by default have won the race to Khuzestan. Soviet Air and Ground Forces have arrived in force around Basra and are preparing to continue their drive to the Saudi Oil Fields. U.S. Air Force assets are prepared to support a Carrier Battle Group as it re-enters the Persian Gulf. KILLERS SOVIETS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : NORTH KOREAN WATERS\n\nDATE/TIME: 21 MARCH 1995, 12:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The war is in the 4th week and things in the Pacific have been in a dead heat. Both naval forces have withdrawn from potentially decisive battles that would have been fought at the others advantage. Casualties for both sides have been relatively light considering the carnage underway in other theatres. The Soviets have held the bulk of the Pacific fleet in port at Vladivostok for the last 2 weeks preparing for a counter attack against any amphibious assault force attempting entry into currently held Soviet territory. Their time has come as the 9th Marine Regiment has landed at Wonsan, North Korea. North Korean Army forces are unable to respond to the incursion and Soviet Quick reaction forces have already been committed. This task falls to the Pacific fleet. U.S. forces have one task, to keep the Soviet surface force bottled up around Vladivostok while the U.S. Marines strike key targets in North Korea. SEA OF OKHOTSK SOVIETS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : SEA OF OKHOTSK\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 JUNE 1989, 01:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The focal point of U.S. Maritime strategy prior to the initiation of hostilities has been a multi-carrier attack on key Soviet shore installations. The one major drawback to this strategy is its lack of surprise. It is very difficult to move something as large as an aircraft carrier for long distances before someone sees it. That is the case here. A Soviet sub transmitted the departure time and initial course of a U.S. Carrier Battle Group via sonobuoy. The Soviet prewar strategy was and is that once a carrier group is sighted, all forces will be focused on its destruction. Herein lies a test of strategies. RETURN OF THE PLO SYRIA/PLO VS ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCE LOCATION : EASTERN MEDITERANEAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 6 DECEMBER 1994, 22:00:00 AULU OVERVIEW: For many years, the military arm of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) posed a significant threat to Israeli national security. This split the attention of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and kept it too busy to concentrate on any single enemy. In 1982, the Syrians orchestrated the departure of the PLO from Beirut to allow Syria to establish control over Lebanon. They then began to build an extensive \"defense\" network. The IDF, now able to concentrate its assets, proved able to counter every move the Syrians made. Syria has decided that the time has come to divide Israel's defensive efforts once again. The PLO will be returned to Lebanon. PRETORIAN GOLD UNITED STATES/SOUTH AFRICA VS SOVIETS/ANC LOCATION : COASTAL SOUTH AFRICA\n\nDATE/TIME: 1 JANUARY 1989, 04:30:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The White Separatist government in Pretoria has begun to come apart. Radical elements of the African National Congress have penetrated the South African Security zones in strength and are now seizing key installations throughout the country. An unnamed South African Defence Ministry Official has announced that an installation known as \"Lock Up 35\" South east of Pretoria contains key elements of the South African Strategic Weapons Program. Publicly, sources are confirming the existence of Chemical and Biological Weapons. Actual estimates include 3-100 kiloton Nuclear Weapons. The facility \"Lock up 35\" was originally designed by the best South African Engineers to provide absolute security for the countries diamond and gold reserves. Limited by a lack of skilled technicians, it is expected that it will take the ANC 7-10 days to gain physical access to the weapons. U.S. Military and Diplomatic representatives brief their counterparts in the Soviet government in an attempt to solicit support for a joint operation to recover the weapons. As an incentive for Soviet support and participation, the U.S. Government has offered to give 1.2 billion dollars of Soviet debt. The African National Congress on the other hand, the soon to be government of South Africa has offered 5 billion dollars in currency and technical support for key Russian industries once in power, if Soviet Military Forces will provide external security for the sovereignty of South African Territories now and give the ANC the time it needs to consolidate its position internally. Moscow needs currency, not debt reduction if it expects to quell the growing domestic unrest. RED SEA RESCUE SOVIETS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : RED SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 12 JUNE 1992, 06:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The Saratoga Battle Group has been badly damaged in the last three (3) days, and many lives have been lost. A path has been charted through the mine field entering the Indian Ocean, at the cost of three (3) ships. Soviet air attacks have sunk the CG Belknap, and damaged the Saratoga. The shore defenses at Aden place too much of a threat for the battle group to face. The Soviets have developed a bastion defense around Aden thought to include a CG Slava and several destroyers. For the Saratoga, the way lies south, into harm's way. BATTLE FOR TEHRAN SOVIETS VS UNITES STATES LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF AND IRAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 20 MARCH 1995, 04:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The soviets have been advancing on Tehran rapidly from two directions. The Iranians were aware of the force approaching from the east. Unfortunately for the Iranians, they assumed the western force would continue south to Khuzestan to meet the expected American landing force. They did not. They are now moving rapidly toward Tehran from the west. The last obstacle to be overcome by the Soviets is a series of bridges and mountain passes en route to Tehran. THE MERGE SOVIETS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : NORTH ATLANTIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 AUGUST 1994, 12:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The war for control of the North Atlantic has reached its climax. Constant air strikes by both sides have rendered Iceland incapable of conducting fixed-wing flight operations. A large vacuum of uncontrolled ocean now exists. Both sides have committed major portions of their remaining fleet assets in filling that vacuum. The stakes are high, for the winner of this battle will likely control the economic balance of power for the next 100 years. RETURN TO YANKEE STATION SOVIETS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION :\n\nDATE/TIME: 8 OCTOBER 1994, 11:30:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The 3rd week of the war finds the Soviet offensive very much on track and in some cases ahead of schedule. Both forces are now settling in to a combat tempo each can support. The one question both forces face now is what will the other do with the war in its 3rd week. The Soviets have moved 2 complete air regiments into 3 bases around Hanoi & Haiphong. Indications are clear that the Soviets are preparing for an offensive. BATTLE OF THE BAY OF BENGAL INDIA VS UNITED STATES VS SOVIETS LOCATION : BAY OF BENGAL\n\nDATE/TIME: 5 JANUARY 1993, 12:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The loss of Diego Garcia as a base compounded the aircrew losses that Soviets faced. Although ship damage was light, the wear and tear of operations was reducing effectiveness, and port visits were required. The Indians agreed to allow a 72 hour port visit to Calcutta, after being lulled into a sense of security by the exaggerated claims of the Soviets. Meanwhile, the U.S. had retired northwestward toward the Arabian Peninsula to replenish and fly on replacement aircraft, a luxury their opponents did not have. With a full flight deck and magazines, the force headed southeast to skirt the Indian air patrols before heading for the Bay of Bengal, where, over 50 years before, Admiral Nagumo had shown the Indians and the British the value of carrier air power. The lesson was about to be taught again. AIRLANE GAMBIT SOVIETS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : AZORES, NORTH ATLANTIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 OCTOBER 1994, 17:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: P-3's from several NATO nations use the Azores as a base to help cover the Mid-Atlantic shipping lanes. Loss of this base would allow transfer of Soviet naval strike aircraft and the closure of the sea lanes from America to Europe. PANAMA HATS CUBA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION :\n\nDATE/TIME: 19 OCTOBER 1994, 04:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: With war beginning to rage in Europe, shipping through the Panama Canal and the Caribbean Sea has become extremely important in moving units to the battlefield for the United States. Conversely, it is important that the Soviets close the canal and hinder U.S. supplies. Cuba's status remains unknown in the conflict but could be troublesome in the event they act in support of the Soviets. LINCHPIN-RED SOVIETS VS NATO LOCATION : NORTH ATLANTIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 19 OCTOBER 1994, 12:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The hard fought battle in Central Europe continues. The Soviets are gaining ground against NATO and believe that victory is in sight. Soviet forces have begun a campaign against Iceland now in an attempt to take control of the North Atlantic and isolate Europe from western support. LINCHPIN BLUE UNITED STATES VS SOVIETS LOCATION : NORTH ATLANTIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 3 NOVEMBER 1994, 04:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: Pre-war battle lines have been restored in all major areas, except Iceland. For the Soviets, this allows them to hold on to some hope that a negotiated peace can be presented as a great victory to the masses. For the U.S. and her allies, allowing the Soviets to retain Iceland is simply unthinkable from both political and military standpoints. Both sides knew that before the battlefield would shift to the conference table, one final battle must be resolved. NORDIC REVENGE SWEDEN VS SOVIETS LOCATION : BLACK SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 10 JANUARY 1994, 21:00:00 OVERVIEW: News of the Soviets attempt to over fly Swedish territory was dispersed to all Swedish commanders quickly, along with casualty reports and plans to extract a pound of flesh for the violations. Swedish naval commanders had noted the Soviets regular supply convoy from St. Petersburg to Kiel and determined that this group of ships would pay the butcher's bill. OPENING MOVES NATO VS SOVIETS LOCATION : BALTIC SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 8 OCTOBER 1994, 01:15:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: In the final hours before the start of the war, a Soviet amphibious group supported by land based air and surface action groups are heading for the Danish coast to seize control of the Sjaelland Islands. Danish and NATO light forces, supported by German air power, attempt to block their path. BAY OF PIGS, PART DEUX CUBA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : COASTAL FLORIDA/CUBA\n\nDATE/TIME: 22 OCTOBER 1994, 21:15:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: Cuba's active participation in the attacks on the Panama Canal and on the radar stations in south Florida provided all the justification needed for removing Castro's government by force of arms. Securing the south-eastern flank of the U.S. would also release additional assets to assist in the planned operation to remove the Soviet occupation of Iceland. POLAR BEARS UNITED STATES VS SOVIETS LOCATION : NORTH PACIFIC\n\nDATE/TIME: 23 OCTOBER 1994, 15:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The Alaska's strike mission against the Soviet Pacific bases was an unqualified success. The only thing that remained was to get her and her escort safely under the protective umbrella deployed from United States air bases. The race was on. RETAKING OF DIEGO GARCIA SOVIETS VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : INDIAN OCEAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 14 OCTOBER 1994, 05:30:00 OVERVIEW: The pre-war harassment of Diego Garcia forced the U.S. to relocate the Maritime Preposition squadron to Oman for safety. Early on the opening day of the war, Indian commandos supported by the Soviet Indian Ocean Squadron quickly overwhelmed the base, and soon it was operating Indian Bear reconnaissance aircraft. The Soviets proceeded to raid shipping along the east coast of Africa while the Indians captured Japan bound supertankers. A U.S. carrier group rounds Cape Good Hope, and the two forces clash NE of Madagascar. RUM PUNCH CUBA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : COASTAL FLORIDA/CUBA\n\nDATE/TIME: 10 AUGUST 1993, 13:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: In the seven days preceding the outbreak of actual hostilities, most of the U.S. F-15C units were deployed to foreign soil. Air defense of the continental U.S. was turned over to the F-16 ADF units of the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserves. In Florida, the 125th Fighter Squadron of Jacksonville was moved to Homestead and augmented by the addition of units from Texas' 147th and 924th. Along with the 56th, these groups focused their attention toward watching Cuba. THIEF IN THE NIGHT UNITED STATES VS SOVIETS LOCATION : NORTH SEA OF JAPAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 21 OCTOBER 1994, 08:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: The movement of the Soviet Pacific Fleet Backfire Regiment to the Indian Ocean was observed by naval planners, and a bold raid on Soviet Pacific bases was proposed and quickly approved. 2ND BATTLE OF TSUSHIMA STRAITS SOVIETS VS JAPANESE SELF DEFENSE FORCES LOCATION : STRAITS OF TSUSHIMA\n\nDATE/TIME: 29 OCTOBER 1994, 05:00:00 ZULU OVERVIEW: Once before in this century, a Russian fleet had sailed into the waters between Japan and Korea, intent on reaching Vladivostok. Then, as now, the mightiest ships of the Japanese Navy were deployed to stop them. NEUTRALITY VIOLATED SWEDEN VS SOVIETS LOCATION : SWEDISH AIRSPACE\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 OCTOBER 1994, 19:45:00 OVERVIEW: A battle-worn British Type 42 destroyer is limping toward England. The commander of Soviet tactical air assets in the area decided that this was just too tempting a target to pass up. The fact that his aircraft would have to cross neutral Sweden to strike the sitting duck didn't bother him at all. In fact, his newly captured airfields in central Finland seemed to fit the bill nicely. VODKA OR SAKE SOVIETS VS JAPANESE SELF DEFENSE FORCE LOCATION : NORTH SEA OF JAPAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 8 OCTOBER 1994, 14:43:30 OVERVIEW: Hostilities between the United States, her allies, and Russia and her client states broke out almost simultaneously across the world. Warned of possible commando attacks, the commander of the Independence battle group got under way from the port of Yokusuka to take up station north east of the home islands. Unfortunately, the warning came too late and mines seeded on the bottom of the bay destroyed the carrier's starboard rudder and badly damaged three of the four screws. CV 62 was out of the fight. CinCPac immediately released the carrier's air wing for use in the defense of Japan. BACKWAR CHINA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : SOUTH CHINA SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 1 OCTOBER 1999, 12:00:00 The events of the last few days have now become clear. The North Korean mobilization was in reality a ploy designed by the Chinese to draw U.S. naval forces into the Yellow Sea, far away from their intended area of operation, Malaysia, and control of the Malacca Strait. Chinese ground forces have landed in force at Kuantan and are now meeting little resistance as they move inland towards the Capital. To sustain the landing forces, the Chinese navy is moving enormous amounts of men and material from the mainland to the beachhead. If the Chinese operation has any weakness, it is the supply line across the South China Sea. The United States, facing much the same situation in the Persian Gulf, has had to slow the pace of operations in the Yellow Sea as critical men and material sit aboard ships in Guam awaiting escort. Reopening the Pacific supply route has now become a strategic imperative with implications far outside the theatre. THE BEIJING SPLIT CHINA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : GULF OF THAILAND\n\nDATE/TIME: 19 OCTOBER 1999, 12:00:00 \"The best made plans.\" This surely could be used to describe the planning involved in the Chinese invasion of Malaysia. But even the most detailed operation suffers from time to time by the unexpected. U.S. Forces were thought to be planning an attack against the Malaysian beachhead to cover the passage of a large convoy through the Strait of Malacca. The attack on the beachhead occurred as predicted but the passage never materialized. The convoy, with complete disregard to the Thai Exclusion Zone, sped north into the Gulf of Thailand and temporary safety. CHAPERONES CHINA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : SOUTH CHINA SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 24 SEPTEMBER 1999, 00:00:00 The mobilization in North Korea now appears to have been an exercise. China has responded to what it represents as clearly aggressive acts by the United States. South Korea, in a surprise move, agreed with Beijing that America was clearly the aggressor. In a total repudiation of American actions, Seoul has frozen all American assets in South Korea and will no longer permit the generation of combat operations from South Korean territory. U.S. naval forces operating around South Korea are now without local air cover. In what China calls a U.S. backed reprisal, the Malaysian government has begun rounding up Chinese dissidents and cutting off their communications with the homeland. Beijing has vowed to protect Chinese citizens, no matter where they live. No independent confirmation of the Malaysian activity has been available. FISH NET CHINA VS JAPAN LOCATION : YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 29 MARCH 1999, 20:00:00 Tensions between Tokyo and Beijing have been on the rise for months. As both countries continue to expand their economies the need for ever more scarce resources has become acute. The latest issue, fishing rights and tariffs have inflamed tensions to the breaking point. In Beijing most of the Old Guard has passed from power. A new regime, eager to establish China as a superpower in the 21st century, is ready to prove to the world that China is a force to be reckoned with. In keeping with the perceived need to protect its coastal fisheries, the government has imposed a 250 mile territorial fishing zone. All commercial fishing boats must have a permit or face confiscation and imprisonment. Tokyo has also sought to secure access to the vital resources that drive the home economy. The Prime Minister has openly declared that the Japanese fishing fleet will not purchase permits to fish in the Yellow Sea and would consider any attempt to seize Japanese registered vessels an act of piracy. FORK IN THE ROAD CHINA VS UNITED KINGDOM LOCATION : HONG KONG\n\nDATE/TIME: 9 JULY 1999, 02:00:00 As the first few days were decisively British, the last two have clearly been Chinese. More than 1000 civilians were lost during the first evacuation attempt. Many made the trip safely, but the headline was very disturbing. Parliament has ordered the total defense of Hong Kong. The Chinese leadership, having recovered from the opening setbacks, and sensing a political vulnerability, has once again begun the build-up towards an attack on Hong Kong. THE FRUIT CHINA VS JAPAN LOCATION : YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 APRIL 1999, 12:00:00 The Japanese Navy conducted what surely will be known as a modern day Kamikaze attack. Three large Japanese surface groups, heavily supported by elements of the air force, made a high speed approach and attack on the Chinese carrier group. The combination of submarine, aircraft and shore based missile attack proved to be too much and the attack had to be aborted. Japanese casualties were very high. The Chinese carrier group is now fully fuelled and ready to begin strike operations. With a large part of the Japanese fleet now at the bottom of the Yellow Sea, there is little between the group and the Japanese coast. For the Japanese Navy, they once again must mount a defense of the home islands against an advancing carrier force. This though is not 1945 and the Chinese are not the Americans. THE GAS LINE CHINA VS JAPAN LOCATION : YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 4 APRIL 1999, 17:00:00 The attack at Tianjin completely surprised the Chinese. The detail in which the operation was conducted clearly represents months of planning and practice. Yet the primary targets of the raid, the aircraft carriers, escaped with no damage. The Chinese, considerably ahead of their schedule, find themselves in a naval engagement with a long time adversary that, for the time, is superior in force, better equipped, and better trained. THE GRAND GAME CHINA VS UNITED KINGDOM LOCATION : HONG KONG\n\nDATE/TIME: 5 JULY 1999, 22:00:00 ZULU Like a pendulum, the war between the British and The People's Republic of China has once again swung back to the Chinese. Tactically, the Chinese have the initiative and superior localized force. But as so often is the case, events beyond the battlefield may tell the ultimate tale. The Americans have made it clear that the attack on Okinawa was an attack on U.S. sovereignty and that no future attacks will be tolerated. For China time is now of the essence. The garrison defending Hong Kong must be eliminated and the Royal Navy destroyed once and for all. The British press is now calling the events of the last few days a \"royal waterloo\". Many speculate the withdrawal from Hong Kong to be the most embarrassing setback the British military has ever suffered. Many now speculate that the British position in Hong Kong is unsustainable and will fall under the weight of a full scale Chinese attack. THE EYES OF INCHON CHINA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 20 SEPTEMBER 1999, 20:00:00 The United States is now fully committed in the Persian Gulf and their logistical apparatus appears to be strained to the maximum. The United States has long expected that during a crisis in the Middle East, North Korea would conduct an invasion of South Korea. As a precaution, the U.S. has always increased surveillance of the Korean peninsula during times of tension. Routine operations today would send shock waves up the American chain of command. THE RISING CHINA VS JAPAN LOCATION : YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 1 APRIL 1999, 23:00:00 The initial phase of the Japanese operation has been very successful. Chinese casualties were heavier than expected though the first line patrol assets thought to be on station in the Yellow Sea were not sighted. World reaction has been particularly positive for the Japanese. Most western media outlets have concluded that China has been the aggressor. Phase two of the operation is now at hand and once again the Japanese Navy must attack an enemy navy in its home port. TALE OF TWO OCEANS CHINA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : SOUTH CHINA SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 OCTOBER 1999, 20:00:00 It is the best of times, it is the worst of times. For China, the invasion in Malaysia is almost complete and the first engagement with the Americans was successful. A U.S. troop convoy, heavily escorted, was turned back by a determined air attack and the sinking of two American submarines has been confirmed. For the United States, the situation grows ever more grave. Forces operating in the desert are consuming supplies at an incredible rate. The Iranians have launched continuous human wave attacks for several days and can be expected to continue for several more. The concern now is a new Chinese threat staging in Pakistan. If the U.S. beachhead is to survive, men and material now in Guam must reach that critical point in the Iranian desert before it's too late. China it seems, must be dealt with now. DESPERATE TIMES CHINA VS JAPAN LOCATION : YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 10 APRIL 1999, 11:00:00 The shift in momentum was almost as palpable in Tokyo as it was in Beijing. The arrival of supplies and the initiation of UNREP Operations by the Chinese carrier force has drastically changed the balance of power in the Yellow Sea. Faced with this new threat, Japanese surface forces, even with their technological edge, would once again have to shift to coastal patrol operations, and any hope of resource security would be lost. The Chinese carriers will be operational in 48 hours. If they are to be destroyed, now is the time. WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST CHINA VS UNITED KINGDOM LOCATION : HONG KONG\n\nDATE/TIME: 5 JULY 1999, 04:00:00 ZULU The Chinese military establishment was shocked by the results of their opening operation. Casualties were very heavy and the loss of equipment in the staging areas caused the cancellation of the ground operation. The British have established a far more effective air defense network than had been expected and they still retain air superiority over Hong Kong. Hong Kong International Airport is still operational and the flow of material and men continues around the clock. YELLOW SURPRISE CHINA VS UNITED KINGDOM LOCATION : OKINAWA\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 JULY 1999, 12:00:00 ZULU The British landing at Xiamen clearly surprised the Chinese. The loss of their amphibious force and the disruption of the flow of supplies through Xiamen have once again delayed the start of the ground offensive against Hong Kong and shifted the momentum of the battle back in favour of the British. These gains however did not come without a price. In order to support the landing, Britain was forced to commit their only reserve force, the carriers. CARIBBEAN SNOWSTORM UNITED STATES VS. DRUG CARTEL AND VENEZUELAN 21 NOVEMEBER 1996, 1525 HRS ZULU LOCATION: GULF OF MEXICO In early 1996, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) began to see fast, military type craft escorting cargo vessels known to be bringing drugs into the country. After numerous gunfire exchanges between Coast Guard (USCG) cutters and these ships, the Department of Defense was consulted. Pictures taken by the USCG showed Nanuchka and Osa class missile boats in the hands of the Cartel. With a Presidential election looming, the National Command Authority (NCA) is hesitant to commit US Forces. Therefore a decision is made to purchase Pael Ku-56 class missile boats from South Korea and allow the DEA to use them in their operations. After the Presidential election, the Russians, attempting to rattle their sabres after getting snubbed in Bosnia, have announced a naval exercise (NAVEX) with Cuba. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has also learned that the Russians, in an attempt to replace lost Western aid, have chosen to sell older ships of their fleet to the highest bidder. Contacts within the Russian Navy confirm that the Cartel purchased larger surface combatants in an effort to counter the DEA missile boats. Shortly after the start of the NAVEX, satellite data showed large numbers of ships and aircraft moving in and around known drug bases. It is believed that the Cartel will use the increased military traffic to hide a major operation of their own. The CIA also believes that the Cartel has bought sensor data from the deployed Cuban assets, but since this can't be confirmed, the NCA has chosen to treat the Cubans as neutrals. Finally, individuals within the Venezuelan Navy, motivated by greed, have offered their services in support of the Cartel. Since this is admitted to by the Venezuelan Government, the NCA has determined that any Venezuelan ship or aircraft is to be treated as hostile. THE CLEANSING LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF/STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 5 APRIL 1999, 20:00:00 The Iranians have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz to scare their enemies into a cease fire. Only the United States has stepped forward in a show of force to make it clear to Iran that the strait will remain open. The U.S. forces were not ready for the ferocity of the Iranian attack they suddenly faced. Now the U.S. must pull its forces from the area. DAVID AND GOLIATH LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF\n\nDATE/TIME: 31 MARCH 1999, 04:00:00 The only nation in the Persian Gulf region smaller than Kuwait is Bahrain. The Bahraini's acquitted themselves well, and Iran either feels it can punish this effrontery with little risk, or that it cannot fail to do otherwise. Strangely enough, while the nations neighbouring Bahrain have stood together against Iran's newest aggressions, the United States has failed to even speak out in support of Bahrain or the other allied nations. Because of this, Iran seems to be gaining more confidence in its actions against other nations in the area. ESCALATION LOCATION : STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 11 MARCH 1999, 20:00:00 The Iranian attack on the Omani amphibious forces at Dubai failed. This embarrassing defeat is not expected to end Iran's hostile feelings toward Oman. Iran is expected to mount a larger strike in an attempt to save face. Oman is preparing its forces to meet any hostilities. The other nations of the Persian Gulf are stepping up patrols of the strait in an attempt to head off any further aggression. ARE QUITE UNACCUSTOMED TO FEAR LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF\n\nDATE/TIME: 18 APRIL 1999, 16:00:00 The U.S. carrier group has taken some losses but has punched through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf. While the Iranians have taken severe losses to their naval forces, they are still far from beaten. The United States now attempts to make another strong push into the Persian Gulf and remove Iran's threat to the region. FALKLANDS WAR I\n\nDon't Cry for Me, Argentina -- Part I\n\nThe Falklands War\n\nby Paul Hager (hagerp@cs.indiana.edu)\n\n[Unlimited Air Ordnance Version] Situation: On April 2, 1982, Argentine forces invaded and captured the Falkland Islands -- a British colony since 1833. This was the culmination of a long-simmering dispute between Britain and Argentina over possession of the islands, known to the Argentines as Las Malvinas. The British have responded by assembling an invasion force -- the largest since the 1944 Normandy Invasion -- in order to recapture the islands. This force, designated TF 317, is comprised of troop transports for the Royal Marines, Commando and Infantry units, and their attendant supplies. The spearhead of TF 317 is TG 317.8 -- the carrier task group. It consists of two small helicopter carriers, one of which (the Hermes) is earmarked for sale to India. This scenario begins with the British declaration of a 200 mile Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) around the Falkland Islands. FLASH POINT LOCATION : STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 3 MARCH 1999, 00:00:00 Over the past several years, Iran has taken strides to increase its military size. As part of their larger overall build-up, Iran has continued to fortify and arm the islands on the Iranian side of the Strait of Hormuz. In addition, there has been a marked increase in patrol activity by Iranian naval assets. The threat to free navigation of the Straits of Hormuz is quite clear. Iran has already conducted one campaign to hinder the free movement of ships in the Arabian Gulf, and the current steps would clearly make a new campaign with similar ends much easier for Iran. The Western Powers and all of the Gulf States, have been watching the situation very closely and with growing concern. FLEET-EX 95-3.2 BLUE FORCES VS ORANGE FORCES LOCATION: EASTERN PACIFIC (SOCAL) DATE TIME GRP: 240700 MAR 95 OVERVIEW: Prior to every Battle Group deployment the units go to sea and practice BG manoeuvres and battle planning. Every warfare area is exercised and tested. No one from the ships' Commanding Officer to the Food Service Attendant (crank) washing pots and pans in the deep sink wants to be known as the loser in a fleet exercise. All action is simulated with the use of on-board computers and impartial referees. \"Damaged\" ships drill their DC (damage control) parties to \"save\" the ship and if possible get back into the fight. IS A FORMIDABLE FOE LOCATION : GULF OF OMAN/STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 16 APRIL 1999, 15:00:00 Iran has seized control of the Strait of Hormuz and all opposition to them in the area has been eliminated. Now only the U.S. carrier group headed into the Gulf of Oman has a chance to stop the Iranians. Iran has had two days to prepare for the carrier groups arrival and cannot be underestimated. NEWFOUNDLAND SCOUTS NATO vs USSR LOCATION: The Grand Banks off Canada\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 November 1995 21:00 Zulu The war in Europe rages. The Russian army has inflicted severe casualties on the NATO forces. Unexpected command and control problems on the NATO side have left them fighting piece-meal battles against a numerically superior Russian force. With the main battle confined to the European continent, there are only isolated skirmishes on the high seas. The Americans and Canadians are feeling relatively secure so far across the sea. But the renegade Russian parliament is planning to bring the war onto North American soil. An invasion is something North America has not seen in the 20th century. This would definitely escalate the conflict in the minds of the American and Canadian people. And so the scene opens off the Atlantic coast of Canada, near the capital of the province of Newfoundland. A surprise attack was what the Russians were expecting to conduct, but Western intelligence has intercepted information regarding the Russian plans. US and British ships have joined the Canadian navy to repel the Russian Expeditionary Force. The Russians have in mind to begin their North American invasion with a small force - to test the water, so to speak. As the Russian Expeditionary Force steams toward the Newfoundland coast, the NATO forces ready themselves for a surface as well as sub-surface engagement. The battle is about to begin! CHEAP SHOT FRANCE VS. NIGERIA LOCATION: GULF OF GUINEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 1 JANUARY 1994, 12:07:42 ZULU Nigerian expansionist moves have alarmed the neighbouring francophone nations, resulting in an appeal to the former colonial power for help. French forces were conducting an exercise with Senegal, so they were dispatched to create a presence offshore. Unfortunately, Nigeria didn't plan to just sit by and get pushed around... PACIFICATION LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF\n\nDATE/TIME: 11 APRIL 1999, 01:00:00 The hostilities have ended and it's time for things to return to normal. Iran is preparing to discuss reparations with the United States, or so they say. The other nations around the Persian Gulf are watching, waiting, and hoping Iran is serious. KILO PATROL LOCATION : GULF OF OMAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 15 MARCH 1999, 12:00:00 With the hostilities slowly diminishing, many countries are looking forward to peace returning to the Persian Gulf region. While all Iranian surface and air forces have been ordered to stand down, a few countries including Oman and Saudi Arabia are concerned about the absence of the Iranian Kilo submarines from their base at Bandar Abbas. The submarines were last reported heading into the Gulf of Oman and could threaten shipping entering and leaving the Strait of Hormuz. RETRIBUTION LOCATION : STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 6 MARCH 1999, 01:00:00 Things have been quiet since the incident in the Strait of Hormuz on March 3rd. Protests and accusations were exchanged via the usual diplomatic channels. The Iranian Government, not only refused to admit fault in destroying the Omani vessels without searching them, but also accused the Omani government of covertly supporting smuggling. The Omani Ambassador has been recalled from Tehran for consultations with his government, but things have otherwise settled down. Oman has taken no demonstrably provocative actions, and all appears calm. OMAN REVISITED LOCATION : GULF OF OMAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 APRIL 1999, 06:00:00 The Persian Gulf nations and the United States believed Iran was sincere in its request for peace. They were completely taken by surprise when Iran launched attacks on Kuwait and then the UAE. The U.S. has sent a large carrier group towards the gulf but it will not arrive for a couple of days. The nations around the gulf must hold off the Iranians alone until help arrives. THE GREAT SATAN LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF/STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 2 APRIL 1999, 12:00:00 With the continued fighting in the Persian Gulf, the United States has endeavoured to remain as neutral as possible in the conflict. Now the U.S. is being forced into action. In a successful attempt to force a cease fire, the Iranians have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. has remained neutral for too long and now it must face down the Iranian threat alone. SEWARD'S FOLLY (BY JAMES N. SCOTT) UNITED STATES VS. Russia LOCATION : THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 22 MAY 1998, 04:00:00 Made in the 1860's the purchase of the Alaska territory was ridiculed as Seward's Folly. Now that the value of the purchase has been realized everyone agrees that it was the deal of the century. The problem now is that the former title holder is having second thoughts. The Russians have attempted to link the return of the Kurile Islands to Japan with the return of Alaska to Russia. Remarkably the Japanese have been very receptive to the deal and very cool to the American stance that the Alaska issue is absolutely non-negotiable. The United States describes the request for the return of Alaska as laughable and won't even discuss it. The Russians seemed to have dropped the issue. Today, however, under the guise of a minor naval exercise, the Russians have launched an invasion right from their bases without any preparation or warning. The Americans scramble to respond. By James N. Scott (Final version 8/31/95) SONS OF ISLAM LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF/STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 20 MARCH 1999, 02:00:00 The hostilities in the strait have ended with both sides doing damage to the other. Iran has protested the involvement of Saudi Arabia and other nations in its dispute with Oman. It is not expected that Iran will follow through with its threats and shipping patrols have returned to normal for all of the gulf nations. THE JUGULAR JAPAN VS CHINA LOCATION : SOUTH CHINA SEA (SPRATLY ISLANDS)\n\nDATE/TIME: 12 DECEMBER 1997 02:00:00 ZULU On 1 July 1997 the Chinese regained possession of Hong Kong. With this important territory reincorporated, China set her sights on regaining another disputed territory, the Spratley Islands. These Islands potentially contain large oil reserves and sit adjacent to vital sea lanes. On 8 August 1997 the Chinese sent numerous task forces into the Spratley Islands and seized the disputed island chain. As expected, Western sanctions came swiftly after forceful occupation of the Spratley Islands. Chinese leaders knew economic sanctions would come, but had underestimated their disastrous effect on the Chinese economy. Unwilling to directly confront the US militarily, but wishing to bring the west to the bargaining table under Beijing's conditions, the Chinese have declared the South China Sea closed to the Japanese. With the vital shipping lanes closed by the Chinese Navy, the flow of oil to Japan will be impeded. Until the sea lanes are opened or a settlement is reached, Japan's economy will also suffer. The newly elected ultra-nationalistic Japanese Diet has decided to break the Chinese blockade, and not only reopen the South China Sea to Japanese commerce, but also to establish Japan as the dominant regional power. STAND DOWN LOCATION : PERSIAN GULF/STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 8 APRIL 1999, 00:00:00 In a surprise move the Iranian government has requested an end to the hostilities occurring in the Persian Gulf area. They have ordered their military to stand down even though they appeared to have forced the United States to retreat. Iran has since released a statement explaining that the firing on U.S. forces was a mistake brought about from a miscommunication and have agreed to pay whatever reparations the United States deemed necessary. STRAIT JACKET LOCATION : STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 11 APRIL 1999, 20:00:00 The hostilities have ended and it's time for things to return to normal. Iran is preparing to discuss reparations with the United States, or so they say. The other nations around the Persian Gulf area are watching, waiting, and hoping that Iran is serious. A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH LOCATION : STRAIT OF HORMUZ\n\nDATE/TIME: 8 MARCH 1999, 23:45:00 The Omani air raid on Iranian coastal sites was successful beyond the expectations of its planners and the amphibious force waiting at Dubai was not needed. So far Iran has made no move in response to the devastating surprise attack. Some authorities have even dared to say that Iranians are going call it even this time. AUSTRALASIAN WAR PART I ANZEF VS INDONESIA LOCATION : BANDA SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 5 NOVEMBER 1994, 08:45:00 ZULU The Indonesian government has been overthrown by the military. The new military government has attempted to close down the Strait of Malacca and harass the shipping of other countries. In response, many regional nations have decided to send forces into the area. Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia are attempting to settle matters with Indonesia before \"foreign powers\" assert their dominance. AUSTRALASIAN WAR PART II SINGAPORE VS INDONESIA LOCATION : STRAITS OF MALACCA\n\nDATE/TIME: 5 NOVEMBER 1994, 09:45:00 ZULU The Indonesian government has been overthrown by the military. The new military government has attempted to close down the Strait of Malacca by harassing the shipping of other countries. In response, many regional nations have responded to the situation. Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia are attempting to settle matters with Indonesia before \"foreign powers\" assert their dominance. OPERATION BIG BASH RUSSIA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : SEA OF JAPAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 31 DECEMBER 1994, 10:00:00 ZULU As the most radical proponents of military totalitarian Russian expansionism gain more political power, Russia's borders with European and Asian countries become areas of vastly increased tension. In response, the US has undertaken to eliminate all Russian naval capabilities from the Pacific Ocean. In line with these objectives, Operation Big Bash has been devised to destroy the strategically significant Russian naval and air facilities at Vladivostok. US naval units have soundly defeated the Russian forces in the Sea of Okhotsk. Now the US forces are closing on Vladivostok. The Tiger is awakened, and the Bear is angered. The battle is afoot! BLOCK THE OIL RUSSIA VS JAPAN LOCATION : THE STRAIT OF MALACCA\n\nDATE/TIME: 1 DECEMBER 1994, 02:00:00 ZULU As economic pressures increase in the countries of the old Soviet Union, the wealth and prosperity of other countries may aggravate existing tensions. Russia and Japan have been disputing the ownership of the islands north of Japan since World War II. In an effort to force Japan to back down from its claim, the Russians have decided to strike at Japan's economic umbilical cord: the Strait of Malacca. All of the oil that Japan's hungry economy consumes flows through the narrow Strait. The strait lies between the countries of Malaysia and Indonesia. If the Russians could completely block this passage, Japan could be starved into giving up its claim. This scenario postulates a Russian blockade of the strait and a possible Japanese military response. In an effort to surprise the enemy, a Russian Indian Ocean task force has been tasked with blocking the channel. DEFENSE OF A FRIEND CHINA VS UNITED STATES LOCATION : STRAIT OF TAIWAN\n\nDATE/TIME: 1 JANUARY 1995, 18:00:00 ZULU By the end of 1994, the world had witnessed two significant military events. First, there was the Chinese attack on Taiwan. The invasion, although fiercely contested by the Taiwanese Naval and Air Forces, was successful. Second, and perhaps as potentially threatening to the balance of naval power in the Western Pacific as the fall of Taiwan, there was the Chinese purchase of the Russian vessels Admiral Flota Sovetskoga Soyuza Kuznetsov, and Admiral Ushakov. In response to the shifting of power in the Western Pacific, and by way of extending aid to Taiwan, a valuable economic ally to the United States, the U.S. government decided to send a carrier group, centered on the Nimitz, to reclaim the Taiwan Strait. Only after the strait is reclaimed can US ground forces embark for Taiwan. FISH STICK THEORY THAILAND VS MALAYSIA LOCATION : NORTHERN STRAIT OF MALACCA\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 DECEMBER 1994, 3:00:00 ZULU As the grand facade of global borders changes in the light of new reformations, so too are changes being wrought on many smaller scale national boundaries. Plans for change and the conflicts bringing about this change are not limited to the high profile scenarios unfolding in Russia and the Middle East. Thailand, seeing the large island on the extreme southern edge of their territorial waters as an attractive opportunity for expansion, decided to invade and expand their borders in the process. The Lang Kawi International Airport offered a valuable potential for increased air traffic with countries to the south. Thailand's claims to rights regarding shipping traffic and fishing in the area would be greatly enhanced. There was just one problem... Malaysia. For whatever reasons that Thailand may wish to acquire the island, the same could be said of Malaysia by way of explaining why they may want to keep it. Bypassing the possible channels of negotiation and commerce, the Thai government decides to use a surprise lightning attack to take the island. The Thai forces count on the fact that retaking the island would be very costly. Here, in this battle, the future of the Thailand-Malaysia border will be decided. The time is now. GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY VIETNAM VS THE PHILIPPINES LOCATION : SPRATLY ISLANDS\n\nDATE/TIME: 10 DECEMBER 1994, 13:30:00 ZULU In an attempt to validate their claims on the Spratley Islands, Vietnam has sent a small task force to conduct manoeuvres in the area. The Philippines, perhaps as an attempt to draw attention from their domestic problems, have decided to contest. These decisions set the stage for a World War II style engagement; unsurprising considering the origin of these two navies' major vessels. INFILTRATION NORTH KOREA VS. SOUTH KOREA LOCATION : WEST COAST OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA\n\nDATE/TIME: 17 OCTOBER 1994, 09:22:00 As the war on the Korean Peninsula rages, small violent naval engagements erupt along the coast. North Korean sabotage and assassination teams are landed by infiltration groups along the coastline. South Korean patrol boats struggle to stem the flood. WHOSE ISLANDS ARE THEY? CHINA VS VIETNAM LOCATION : PARACEL ISLANDS\n\nDATE/TIME: 18 SEPTEMBER 1994, 17:20:00 The western pacific is dotted with many small insignificant islands; however, if a country can successfully lay claim to an island, that country can place a 200 mile economic exclusion zone around the island. All resources in that region can only be exploited by the controlling nation. This scenario pits the Vietnamese against China in a skirmish over the Paracel islands. Vietnamese and Chinese governments both lay claim to these islands. Chinese and Vietnamese warships will settle the claim. PHONE TAP UNITED STATES VS. RUSSIA LOCATION : THE SEA OF OKHOTSK\n\nDATE/TIME: 25 DECEMBER 1994, 06:00:00 ZULU Eavesdropping on another country's communications has been a standard method of \"spying\" in this century. This scenario postulates a tap on a Russian fibre optic cable running along the sea floor of the Sea of Okhotsk. This tap records data flowing through the line for later retrieval. It's time to retrieve the data. PIRACY AT SEA INDONESIA VS MALAYSIA LOCATION : STRAIT OF MALACCA\n\nDATE/TIME: 13 NOVEMBER 1994, 12:52:05 ZULU The evolution of worldwide economic distress has had a destabilizing effect on the worldwide political theatre. Militant factions of smaller countries have been able to win the support of the masses in many countries, and, for some, the support comes from the armed forces. Such a swing of power towards the military elements has occurred in Indonesia. With limited resources, at least when compared to the possible combined forces that could be brought to bear by a multinational force, the militant faction leaders have decided to wage a slower, more terroristic war in the Strait of Malacca. The quick strike-and-retreat attacks on random shipping moving though the Strait is seen as the best tactic to offer the world proof that the new Indonesian government can back up its claims to being a new major player in international affairs. Tension in the area has risen by several degrees over the past month. Defensive forces in the area have been told to stifle any attempted attacks on national shipping by Indonesian warships. Malaysia in particular has increased its diligence in patrolling their territorial and surrounding waters. The Strait is however, long and rimmed by many island bolt-holes for marauding ships to hide in. The success of the Indonesian efforts lies in their ability to strike-and-retreat, causing more damage to passing shipping than any defensive forces may inflict in return. For Malaysia, it's a matter of seek and destroy. For the world, it's a matter of wait and watch. REUNIFICATION BY FORCE PART I NORTH KOREA VS. SOUTH KOREA LOCATION : EAST COAST OF THE KOREA PENNISULA\n\nDATE/TIME: 14 OCTOBER 1994, 03:15:00 ZULU After the breakdown of talks between North and South Korea over the subject of nuclear plants, tension increased along the border. As tensions built, diplomats attempted to defuse the situation. On October 13, all negotiations were broken off. As night fell, the South Koreans feared what the new day would bring. REUNIFICATION BY FORCE PART II NORTH KOREA VS. SOUTH KOREA LOCATION : WEST COAST OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA\n\nDATE/TIME: 14 OCTOBER 1994, 03:45:00 With North Korean ground units storming south across the border, the second Korean War is officially underway. Landings of North Korean troops along the east coast have created a difficult situation. As South Korean naval units rush to protect their west coast, North Korea launches its naval strike. SANCTIONS UNITED STATES VS. NORTH KOREA LOCATION : THE YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 9 AUGUST 1994, 20:20:00 With the breakdown of talks between the United States and North Korea over nuclear re-processing, the United States re-introduced a request to the United Nations for economic sanctions against North Korea. Heated diplomatic debates resulted in a Chinese veto of the proposed sanctions in the UN Security Council. As a result of this set-back, the United States has unilaterally invoked a blockade of North Korea. Angry protests from the Chinese government have resulted in a tense situation... BATTLE FOR THE YELLOW SEA UNITED STATES VS CHINA AND NORTH KOREA LOCATION : THE YELLOW SEA\n\nDATE/TIME: 9 NOVEMBER 1994, 05:00:00 ZULU As the rapidly expanding second Korean War continues. US forces rush to the aid of an overwhelmed South Korean Navy. While losses on both sides have been heavy, North Korean submarines have exacted a heavy toll on the South Korean Navy. To make the situation even more complex, Chinese naval units have begun to act more aggressively. The Yellow Sea is clearly under the control of the North Koreans and Chinese. In an effort to gain control of the situation, the US sends in the Independence Carrier Battle Group. Using its powerful air wing, the Independence is to send a powerful message to the North Koreans and the Chinese. In addition, the US forces will be clearing the way for additional US ground troops. A lack of a clear command structure has made the situation unclear. All sides in this battle will struggle to gain a clear picture of the situation."
