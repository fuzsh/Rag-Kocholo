        "text": "Throughout history, seas have connected societies. Coastal areas and ports acted as key nodes in economic and cultural networks that stretched across Europe and the globe. Yet, maritime societies were also among the first to feel the impact of war and environmental change. Seas' and oceansâ€™ roles in connecting and dividing lands and peoples have featured prominently in literature and the visual arts since at least the Odyssey. This interdisciplinary study day draws on themes that cut across all aspects of maritime studies, such as communities, environment, connectivity, trade, shipping, the sea in thought, law and representation, and global and regional development in the pre-modern world (c. 500-c. 1700). It will draw together individuals from multiple disciplines to discuss exciting developments in research. This event is organised with the collaboration of the SMMI. You can consult the full programme of the day and register to this event by following this link: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/cmrc-study-day-tickets-128731540503"
