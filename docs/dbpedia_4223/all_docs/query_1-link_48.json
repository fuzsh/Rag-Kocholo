        "text": "Dude, I have no idea what you are talking about (I hope).\n\nAdmin: Deleted comment. That one was a bit unnecessary.\n\nGive me some specifics and I'll debate them. I am reasonalby confident in my ideas.\n\n1-The RNZAF doesnt have the necessary equipment to CURRENTLY support ASMs\n\n2-The government hasnt put into its budget that there will be a ESM or ECM suite into the P-3s for the forseeable future.\n\n3-The P-3 is way to vulnerable to a Mobile SAM from a small maritime craft.\n\n4-The P-3 laiden with the Harpoon will be too heavy to carry out a long reach mission to take out a target. Thats if we know one is there.!\n\n5-The P-3 CANNOT loitre and carry out survellience work with such weopons for any extended length of time.\n\n6-The P-3 doesnt have a refueling capability to carry out such a mission.\n\n7-The P-3 cannot fire a Harpoon beyond visual range operations and identify a target because its limited radar and targeting acquisition.\n\n8-If the P-3 was bought with the A-4 as some say then there was a good reason for this. That was to operate with a strike combat force alongside. It cant operate alone.! Simple.\n\n9-The P-3 cant get to target fast, and having a jet laiden A-4 or similar with all the combat suites is going to do the job faster and quicker.\n\n10-The P-3s limited manuvurability(spelt that wrong sorry) in a war zone is asking for trouble. It needs an escort for protection\n\nYour answers dont answer my questions and certainly doesnt address these issues and i wish you would debate them logically. I will say it again, the P-3s must work alongside the A-4s as designed for maritime strike. Thats to say we need our strike force back. P3s and c-130s are not an Airforce. Its like a Tiger with no teeth.! The Navy and Army MUST have the Strike force working alongside them to acheive military goals both now and in the future. Australia knows this fact and so does most other 1st and 2nd rated countries throughout the world. To think that a P3 can do this work by itself is in a fantasy world somewhere, and has no handle on military doctrine.\n\nSecondly, we need to pull our weight and protect our own assets at sea and land wherever that may be. That means being able to field weopons that will effectively protect as well as take out potential threats. Whether thats in and around NZ, the South pacific or in Asia , makes no difference. A P-3 loaded with a Harpoon fired outside the field of risk isnt going to fix our air combat issues. In fact they will become a liability if operated with our allies in areas we dont share and yet the enemy has SAMs to take out P3s and such like.\n\nHere is my proposal. And would welcome those for your ideas. I think the P3 should be armed lightly as a secondary offensive weopon only, with a ASM. The main role of offensive duties should go to a air Strike force where they are trained to fast dog fighting action and air to ground missions if so required and can fire their weopons with BVR weopons. This would save the Orion for further survellience work and back up the strike force. Remember also that it is possible that NZ could lease or we could have a Tanker based at Ohakea from Australia for such missions if so required and the aircraft we operate be fitted with air to air refueling. With no gaps in our ability to defend ourselves and deploy properly we are functioning correctly with the other forces and allies in our area. To just front up with a P3 as a front line means of defense for our troops on the ground and Navy is an insult.\n\nRe: RNZAF P3 Orion\n\nAdmin: As stated prev - please use online edit facilities so as to make things easier for everyone when reading and responding.\n\nMy colleague has put together a scenario and some questions in this area and i want to answer them as best i can but i would welcome your input as well. Let me know what you think.\n\nWhat do you see as threatening it in the South Pacific?\n\nMarcus40 Answer: This question is one that leads to other aspects of the P3s operations and current abilities and the geo political nature both now and for the future in other parts of the world. Not just whats threatening it in the South Pacific if a low level war broke out there. First our government use this aircraft for patrol duties working along side Australia with its limited role as our systems are currently on this aircraft are not as up to date as the Australians. So firstly because there are no upgrades militarily we have put this aircraft at risk\n\nThe next thing is to load a P3 with Harpoons restricts its range and loitre abilitys dramatically. Its manueverability is effected and operating speed. Especially if the weopons are deployed on the aircraft externally. If the aircraft had inflight refueling then that might be fine. I would suggest that this would not be the case because of the age of the aircraft being very old.\n\nThe other major reason why its crazy to load such expensive weopons onto a P3 is that the Navy and Army will require more agile and dog fighting skills from our own to kill assets for the Army in the field and a harpoon alone doesnt cut it.\n\nThe P3 is not a multi tasking wepon system that can fire a mixture of weopons for the protection of the navy and Airforce and of course our Army. A P3 cannot protect a C-130 if called upon it to do so.\n\nThe P3 is a Survellience aircraft that can have a secondary offensive maritime role working alongside a Air combat force. The only problem is we dont have a air combat force and this alone means that the Australians will have to look after them with their F-18s.\n\nTo cap it off with this question to have 6 orions in our armery for the size and remoteness of our geo location is laughable and remember that not all 6 can be deployed at once to hit targets BVR.\n\nWhat do you see the NZDF doing in the South Pacific? Who is going to threaten a P3 etc?\n\nMarkus40 Answer: In future years its likely that NZ will have a greater role in this region and working alongside its allies and the enemy will get smarter and have better weopons. They will be able to afford them too.\n\nThe question is not whos going to threaten a P3 but rather the threat will lie within the P3s ability to carry out the operations currently without its offensive upgrades and operations with our allies.\n\nThe other thing is that its most likely as well that a Harpoon armed P3 is better kept for Intel and survellience and have a number of Air to ground aircraft operated by the RNZAF doing the mix of jobs that its capable of doing for our Army and Navy. Thats why im in favour of bringing back the Air Combat force as its fast and can get the job done faster. If our boys in the Army call for a air strike on a position then i think the commander on the ground would have to be drunk to call up 2 harpoon equiped P3s.!\n\nAlso remember that the C-130 is used as a tactical transport and would be much more likely to be in danger than a P3.\n\nMarkus40 Answer: The P3 and C-130 are 2 big \"birds\" and both are in danger of being lost in a low level war. I disagree with this comment vehemently.\n\nTo my mind intervention into a island state, where recon and precision strike of targets may be needed is the likely scenario, but please let me know what you see as a threat.\n\nMarkus40 Answer: Sounds like the author of this comment has come full cirle on himself and suggested a precision strike into a island state. Thats why my argument for a Air Combat force with the ability of its mix of weponary to do this job for our boys who need it on the ground and on the sea, quickly, fast and accuratley.\n\nLet me know what your answers are. I look forward to your comments.\n\nWhiskyjack said:\n\nI will definitely like to get some other opinions from members, but this is where I am coming from.[/SIZE]\n\nNZ has a large area of responsibility from the Equator in To Antarctica. What it needs is maritime (including island) surveillance. I propose that over the next 10 years that NZ build up a force mix of UAV (Mariner etc..) and MPAs (P3s etc). [/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE]\n\nTo support a strike force in the Pacific would require a minimum of 20 fast jets plus tankers to get them up to the Pacific. This is not realistic and not needed given the environment NZ operates in.[/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE]\n\nArming the P3s with a missile like the JASSM (400km range), Harpoon (130km), NSM (160), or the SLAM-ER (240km). Will allow for a force that can find and engage targets (both air and land) pretty much anywhere in NZ area of interest. The assets can also be deployed in coalition operations where coalition fighters provide cover. Missiles are expensive but that is where militaries are moving stand off weapons (e.g. RAAF spending $550m on JASSM)[/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE]\n\nNow I now P3 have been used in Africa and the Balkans, as well as the Gulf to provide surveillance on both land and sea. I consider these environments to be of greater risk than the Pacific. Now the P3 would be used for precision strikes against Land and Sea targets that had been identified by UAV, other P3s, SAS etc. It is most definitely not intended to provide CAS for the army.[/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE]\n\nNow logistically NZ is not capable of providing CAS out into the South Pacific. For instance Fiji is 2000km from NZ. To provide CAS out to that distance requires lots of Tanker support. A base closer requires political approval, and still lots of logistics. properly equipped the NZ army can provide its own devastating fire support (120mm mortar, 155mm or NLOS-LS).[/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE]\n\nStrategically there is nothing in NZs area of operations that currently, or in the medium future, requires NZ to spend on a strike force with tanker capabilities.[/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE]\n\nSo bearing in mind that this is the force structure I envision I will answer your points.[/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE]\n\nI think that I have replied to this above, but one more point, please give me specific threats and systems that you see in NZs region that will make unescorted P3s suicidal, please remember they will be upgraded and have UAV support. I am interested to see what systems you see threatening them? I honestly can't think, if they were deployed to Timor or Fiji today, of anything that is going to threaten a P3 at 20,000 ft.\n\nPlease see above, I will also add that the budget the Govt has given to add ASMs is only $50m so much of the work must be part of the current upgrade.\n\nI have answered that above.\n\nI disagree and can find many examples of where P3s are used in similar environments, they fly above the threat envelope\n\nI disagree on this point as well a P3 carrying two ASMs can still reach out to Fiji, looked at several sets of specs on this.\n\nLike any sortie it depends on the mission profile, can't see the logic you are using here?\n\nNor would any strike fighters in NZ service, the only difference is that the P3 can reach MUCH further, hence it suits the environment.\n\nDepends how they are operated and equipped, your tactics depend on resourses, UAVs, other P3s etc. How is the target going to be found and identified in the first place?\n\nYes it can and yes it does, many nations do, it all depends on the threat situation and tactical doctrine used. The A4s operated in the days when you had to get 10km away or even closer. Standoff is the new attack method, hence much work had also gone into target identification from a distance\n\nYes, I find buildings and other main targets don't tend to move. If you have a UAV at 40000-50000, ships don't tend to get away either. How far out are your A4s operating? I think the RNZAF needs to operate at a distance.\n\nWhat do you see as threatening it in the South Pacific?\n\nWhat do you see the NZDF doing in the South Pacific? Who is going to threaten a P3 etc?\n\nAlso remember that the C-130 is used as a tactical transport and would be much more likely to be in danger than a P3.\n\nTo my mind intervention into a island state, where recon and precision strike of targets may be needed is the likely scenario, but please let me know what you see as a threat.\n\nRe: RNZAF P3\n\nSomething else i should have mentioned is this. The most likely scenario is that if we have a Air combat force in the air with air to ground weopons the forward positions officer marking the target with a laser can keep the pilot up to date with situation of the target like a tank or truck etc. The pilot will be able to lock onto co ordinates as the time goes by to take out the target.\n\nBesides the weopons used to do this job would be far cheaper than Harpoon armed P3. Im not belittling a Harpoon and they are extremely useful in certain circumstances but not a fire and forget weopon with a one shoot and one hit option when a pilot with multiple weopons can make several passes with low cost weopons and take out more targets than the harpoons one target at a price of around $700,000 each (i think). Its just stupid to think that the latter could be an option.\n\nQUOTE=Markus40]My colleague has put together a scenario and some questions in this area and i want to answer them as best i can but i would welcome your input as well.
