        "text": "3.1 Comparison with observations\n\nThe analysis of the results begins with the comparison between the observed and modelled power spectra calculated from the vertical displacement of the isopycnals at the mooring locations (Fig. 2). The model results were only considered to match the observational periods (Table 1). We selected a set of isopycnals that can be tracked over the entire time-series while optimizing the vertical resolution. The depth of selected isopycnal surfaces were determined and the time series of vertical isopycnal displacements were determined by subtracting the average depth of the respective isopycnal surface. The isopycnal vertical displacement was assigned to the mean depth of the isopycnals. Power spectra densities are calculated using Welch’s method (1967) by dividing the time series into 3.5-day window segments with 1-day overlap and applying a Hamming window to each segment. The vertical coverage of the spectra is a consequence of the sensor depths and the methods used (isopycnal displacement does not work in the mixed layer). At the OM1 location, both the model simulations and the observations show that most of the energy is at low frequencies, especially in the deeper layers. In the observations and in the simulation accounting for the tidal forcing, there are internal baroclinic local maxima at the K1 and M2 frequencies, although the simulated vertical structure only partially resembles the observations. Without the tidal forcing, the model tends to produce relative maxima with a vertical baroclinic structure at the local inertial frequency (~ 20.6 h). Toward the shelf, at the OM2 site, the amount of energy contained in the tidal frequencies increases considerably. Unfortunately, mooring OM2 was only equipped with a few sensors between 135 and 300 m depth, so it is not possible to analyse the entire water column. However, similar to OM1, the model simulation forced with the tides shows significant maxima at both the K1 and M2 frequencies, while the simulation without tides shows maxima at the inertial frequency.\n\nAt the three shallow moorings (OM3, OM4 and WW), the presence of internal tides was evident at both K1 and M2 frequencies. However, the K1 frequencies are much more energetic than the M2 frequencies. The vertical extent of the maximum varies among the different sites due to the different depth and stratification of the water column. The simulation without tides does not reproduce the observed energy distribution and still shows the internal waves at the inertial frequency. With the introduction of the tides, the model captures the vertical energy structures observed at the different mooring locations quite well. Few notable differences exist for OM4 where most of the energy is trapped near the bottom in the model simulation and only one relative maximum occurs at the K1 frequency at mid-depth. Differences between model results and observations may be ascribed to several factors, most probably the misrepresentation of bathymetry being the dominant one. A preliminary comparison (not shown) of bathymetric data collected during the sea-trial and the dataset used to create the model grid revealed a generally good agreement in the large-scale bathymetric features of the studied area but differences were observed in the exact isobath positions. In agreement with Poulain et al. (2023), we conclude that internal waves with diurnal frequency are enhanced on the shelf, while semidiurnal internal tides are also present at the base of the mixed layer but are generally less energetic than diurnal tides.\n\nIt is clear that by introducing the tidal forcing, the model is able to reproduce the dynamics of the internal tides, while without tides the local energy maxima occur at the inertial frequency. The vertical structure is only qualitatively similar between the model forced with tides and the observations. The differences may be due to errors in bathymetry, or in the vertical structure of the water column. However, it is clear that the internal tides and their spatial distribution are adequately represented in the model. In the rest of the paper, we will focus on the discussion of diurnal internal tides because they are the most energetic.\n\n3.2 Temporal and spatial distribution\n\nThe temporal coverage of the observational records is relatively short (WW, the longest record is about 12 days), making it difficult to capture the temporal evolution of internal tides from the observations. However, given the good agreement between the modelled and observed energy distributions at the mooring locations, we can examine the time and space domains of the model to gain a better understanding of the local dynamics.\n\nFigure 3 shows the time series of the amplitude of the diurnal tidal current (extracted from the model simulation using the MATLAB® t_tide algorithm, Pawlowicz et al. 2002) along with the Morse wavelet coefficients (Olhede and Walden 2002; Lilly 2017) calculated from the isopycnal vertical displacement at the WW location and at the depth of maximum K1 energy (approximately 150 m in the observations and model simulation without tides, and 130 m in the model simulation accounting with tidal forcing, Fig. 2). Wavelet coefficients are shown for the two simulations and for the observations. In the model simulation that takes into account the tidal forcing, the temporal variability of the wavelet coefficient resembles the cycle of neap-spring tides. As expected, the energy at K1 or M2 frequencies is very weak in the simulation without tides. Although short, a temporal evolution of the wavelet coefficients can also be seen in the observational dataset, with the energy increasing during the study period in agreement with the occurrence of the spring tide. However neap-spring tides and oscillations in the amplitude of the internal tides are not perfectly in phase. This may indicate that internal tides are not generated exactly at the WW site. However, the model simulations show that they are certainly generated within the model domain.\n\nFollowing Nash et al. (2012), vertical velocity is used to identify internal tides, their distribution, and intensities. The spatial distribution of the vertical velocity energy associated with the internal K1 tides, in the entire model domain, is shown in Fig. 4 for three different 8-day time windows centered on the spring tide events. The vertical velocities are integrated in a 50-m thick bottom layer after removing the barotropic component (which accounts for barotropic tides, surface fluxes and bottom boundary conditions):\n\n$${w}_{it}(x,y,t)=\\frac{1}{50}{\\int }_{H}^{H-50}{w}^{^{\\prime}}\\left(x,y,z,t\\right)\\partial z$$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \\({w}^{^{\\prime}}\\) is obtained by first removing the barotropic component. Sensitivity experiments (not shown) indicate that the results are robust regardless the thickness of the bottom layer. The spatial distribution of K1 energy strongly resembles the bathymetric features, with higher energy associated with the largest bathymetric gradient (Fig. 5, left panel). The highest energies are near the bathymetric slope of the Ionian Sea and near the canyons west and northwest of Malta, with the lowest values observed on the Malta Bank. Temporal variability during the three events is quite low, suggesting that the dynamics and processes involved are quite stable within the time scales considered. Minor differences are observed north of Malta and south of the Malta Bank.\n\nDiurnal internal tide barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion, depth-integrated flux and dissipation have been computed. Following Nash et al. (2012) energy flux (F) is approximated by:\n\n$${\\varvec{F}}={\\int }_{-H}^{0}\\langle {{\\varvec{u}}}^{^{\\prime}}{p}^{^{\\prime}}\\rangle dz$$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \\({{\\varvec{u}}}^{^{\\prime}}\\) and \\({p}^{^{\\prime}}\\) are the baroclinic velocity fluctuation and baroclinic pressure anomaly respectively, and angle bracket (< >) indicates the average over one, or more, tidal periods.\n\nBarotropic to baroclinic energy conversion rate (Ctopo) is computed as:\n\n$${C}_{topo}={\\left.-{p}^{^{\\prime}}\\right|}_{z=-H}{{\\varvec{u}}}_{{\\varvec{t}}{\\varvec{b}}}\\cdot \\nabla H$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \\({{\\varvec{u}}}_{{\\varvec{t}}{\\varvec{b}}}\\) is the tide-induced barotropic velocity and H is the bathymetry of the model (Kurapov et al. 2003). Assuming that the local time derivative and the advection of diurnal internal tide energy terms are small, dissipation (\\(\\epsilon\\)) of internal tides is estimated as:\n\n$$\\epsilon ={C}_{topo}-\\nabla \\cdot {\\varvec{F}}.$$\n\n(4)\n\nTo compute \\({{\\varvec{u}}}^{^{\\prime}}\\) and \\({p}^{^{\\prime}}\\) in Eqs. 2 and 3, model baroclinic velocities and densities were bandpass filtered to retain only variability at K1 frequency (± 10% of K1 period, which is 23.93 h).\n\nIn Fig. 5, the three terms (Eqs. 2, 3 and 4) averaged between 2 and 10 November are shown. In a, the tidal ellipses extracted from the model simulation at K1 frequency are overlaid with the topographic energy conversion term. Similar to the energy distribution, \\({\\varvec{F}}\\), Ctopo, and \\(\\epsilon\\) are also characterized by very similar pattern and values during the other two events (not shown). Large positive Ctopo values are present on the Ionian bathymetric slope and south of the Malta Bank approximatively following the 300 m isobath (Fig. 5a). Negative Ctopo values, indicating energy converted from baroclinic to barotropic motion, south of Malta coincide with the relative minima observed in the energy distribution (Fig. 4b). The tidal ellipses show that in areas where the bathymetric features are less pronounced or where the major axes of the tidal ellipses are parallel to the slope, conversion is less effective. We conclude that topographic energy conversion is one of the most important mechanisms generating diurnal internal tides in the area and also determining their variability. The vertically integrated flux vector (Fig. 5b and sketched in Fig. 1b) clearly indicates that the interaction of the barotropic flow with the bathymetry generates two different waves and wave patterns which are trapped by the topographic slope and propagate along this slope with the shelf to their right. The dissipation term distribution (Fig. 5c) indicates that south of Malta part of the energy removed from the internal tide is lost. Energy dissipation near the generation sites is mainly associated with the dissipation of internal tides having higher-order vertical modes (Laurent et al. 2002).\n\nThe zonal and meridional Hovmöller diagrams of \\({w}_{it}\\) band-pass filtered at the K1 frequency are shown in Fig. 6. The band-pass filter used is a zero-phase 4th order Butterworth filter with a lower and higher cutoff periods of 21.537 h and 26.323 h, respectively (± 10% of K1 period, which is 23.93 h). Velocities are masked according to the energy distribution shown in Fig. 4b, to ensure that only regions with sufficient associated energy are considered. It is difficult to discern a clear pattern in the zonal direction. A slightly coherent pattern is observed from 15.5° to 16.0° E where the internal waves tend to propagate westward. West of 15.5° E the slope of the contours fluctuates, with the spatial scale becoming smaller toward the west. The meridional section is characterized by a more consistent pattern for the most part. South of 36.0° N, the waves tend to propagate southward. North of 36.0° N the wave moves northward but the field appears quite discontinuous, with a small portion of the section where the direction of propagation fluctuates.\n\n3.3 Single event analysis\n\nFigure 7 shows maps of \\({w}_{it}\\), band-pass filtered at K1 frequency (± 10%), during a particular event. Again, velocities are masked according to the energy distribution. Snapshots every 3 h are shown from 00:00 to 9:00 UTC on 7 November. The propagation path can be seen more clearly. Large \\({w}_{it}\\) values are associated with the slopes that connect the Ionian Sea with the Malta Bank, where topographic energy conversion is also large (Fig. 5a). The modelled wave pattern is consistent with the vertically integrated energy flux vector (Fig. 5b) and the interpretation of the Kelvin wave trapped near the bottom (Poulain et al. 2023; Artale et al. 1989). The internal wave moves while maintaining the bathymetric slope to its right. The most energetic wave packets move southward along the slope and clearly interact with the complex bathymetry. Other wave packets manage to pass the slope and move westward south of Malta. West of Malta, two propagation branches are evident. One branch moves northward toward Sicily, and a second branch continues its journey westward.\n\nWe analyse the two identified main waves in the model results individually, by considering the sections above the isobaths of 320 m and 700 m (Fig. 1b, red and green lines, respectively). The band-pass filtered integrated vertical velocities, \\({w}_{it},\\) are sampled along the two sections and the corresponding Hovmöller diagrams are shown in Fig. 8. For each point along the section, the model results falling within a 4-km radius (2–3 model points) are averaged so that the velocity intensities are smoothed and are graphically shown normalized by their maximum value to aid interpretation. Following the isobaths appears to be an efficient method for tracking the internal waves as the Hovmöller diagrams show more coherent patterns with respect to those shown in Fig. 6. Overall, the diagrams confirm the previous interpretation that the waves propagate from the continental slope connecting the deep Ionian Sea to the relatively shallow Sicily Channel. The waves propagate with variable phase speed westward in the red transect and southward in the green transect consistent with the bathymetric gradient.\n\nAlong the “red” transect (Fig. 8, top panel), about 140 km from the origin, a clear discontinuity of velocities is observed (in agreement with the energy minimum, Fig. 4). This corresponds to the turning point west of Malta, where waves deviate and begin to move northward. Given the coherence between the previous and subsequent points along the section, we assume that the main signal is due to the propagation of the waves from the eastern sector of the domain. However, geometry and local energy transfer (Fig. 5 a and c) may play an important role here. Between 250 and 290 km (see Fig. 1 for a graphical localization), the phase propagation oscillates between positive and negative values. Here, the waves change from a southward to westward motion and the bathymetric gradient has also some discontinuities (Fig. 1b). We argue that following the isobath in this particular area is not an accurate method.\n\nAlong the “green” transect, we see that the energy is much lower in the southern sector, far from the point of origin (Fig. 8, bottom panel). In this region, Ctopo has large negative values, subtracting energy from the baroclinic component. Although a general behaviour is easily observed, the waves do not propagate with constant phase speed along the section. Between 100 and 130 km from the origin of the section, there is no clear slope in the Hovmöller. In this region, there is a meander in the 700 m isobath and dissipation occurs (Fig. 5c).\n\nTo quantify the wave properties, we calculated the cross power spectrum between successive points along each transect. Similar to the \\({w}_{it}\\) calculation, the cross-power spectra are calculated by dividing the time series from 4 to 12 November into 3.5-day window segments with an overlap of 1 day. From the phase shift, \\(\\Delta \\theta\\), and from the distance between two consecutive points, d, we calculated the wavelength (\\(\\lambda =2\\pi d/\\Delta \\theta\\)) and the phase speed (\\(\\lambda \\omega\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is the frequency of the diurnal internal wave). Given the adopted method, the estimated quantities refer to the relative orientation of the two considered points. The results are shown in Fig. 9.\n\nThe two sections differ in mean properties and scales of variability. The phase speed of the “red” section (Fig. 9, top panel) oscillates between 0.5 and 1.6 ms−1 in absolute values, corresponding to a wavelength between 50 and 130 km. These values derived from the model agree well with the those estimated from the observations (Poulain et al. 2023). As the waves turn around Malta, they reach a minimum speed and wavelength of about 0.5 ms−1 and 40 km, respectively. Between 180 and 200 km from the origin, a change in the sign of the phase speed is observed, which is less evident in the Hovmöller diagrams. In this area, south of Malta, the bathymetry becomes more complex and exhibits a relatively deep trench parallel to the wave propagation direction and the bottom conversion term also has positive values. We speculate that the non-locally generated wave may be undergoing local energy exchange. The oscillations observed in the Hovmöller diagram between 250 and 290 km correspond to changes in the sign of the phase speed.\n\nThe “green” section (Fig. 9, bottom panel) is characterized by relatively small values of phase speed and wavelength in its southern sector (corresponding also to low energy values, Fig. 8). Approaching the northern part of the section, the phase speed and wavelength have values similar to those in the “red” section, with a speed of about 1 ms−1 and a wavelength of about 90 km. The change in the sign of the phase speed generally corresponds to the meandering of the 700 m isobath. We argue that we do not exactly follow the internal wave propagation path along the 700 m isobath, and that the values in certain locations are representative of the main propagation axes (long and fast waves), while in other areas, they are almost perpendicular to the propagation path (short and slow waves).\n\n3.4 Impact on vertical mixing\n\nThe importance of mixing associated with the shear and breaking of internal waves in the general ocean circulation and energy budget has been extensively studied (Ferrari and Wunsch 2009; St. Laurent and Garrett 2002). The turbulent closure model used to compute the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients is based on a prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy, and a closure assumption for the turbulent length scales. The time evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy results from the balance between a positive term related to the vertical shear, and negative terms related to stratification, vertical diffusion, and dissipation. Thus, in the present model configuration, there is no specific parameterization of mixing associated with internal wave breaking. However, the presence of internal waves feeds the shear production term in the prognostic equation for the turbulent kinetic energy term, resulting in higher vertical mixing coefficients. To understand and quantify the effect of the increased vertical mixing, we begin by comparing the vertical turbulence coefficients with and without tides along the two transects and averaging the model results from November 4 to 12.\n\nFigure 10 shows the logarithm of the ratio between the vertical mixing coefficients predicted in the simulation with and without tidal forcing. As expected, internal tides increase the vertical turbulence in both sections, especially near the bottom. Along the “red” section, the increase in vertical mixing is quite homogeneous from 200 m downward. It reaches peak values where the presence of internal tides increases the vertical turbulence coefficients by more than 3.5 times compared to the simulation without internal tides. There is only one region where the weekly averaged vertical turbulence coefficient is lower in the presence of internal tides, between 160 and 220 km from the origin of the section. This also corresponds to the region where the wave propagation direction has the opposite direction (Fig. 9), confirming the specificity of the area and the fact that the method of following the isobath is likely to fail.\n\nSimilarly, the vertical mixing coefficients along the “green” transect in the simulation with tidal forcing are significantly larger than those without the tides. There are two areas where the logarithmic values are higher than 1, between 60 and 90 km and between 120 and 140 km from the origin of the transect. Both areas are characterized by the highest energy content. The first section corresponds to an area where the internal tides are well traced following the isobath, the phase speed and the wavelength are quite homogeneous (Fig. 9) and the maximum associated energy is observed (Fig. 8). The second section shows high variability in terms of phase speed and wavelength.\n\nIn both sections, there are also areas where the vertical mixing at the bottom of the mixed layer is noticeably increased. To distinguish between the effects of semi-diurnal and diurnal internal tides in the local dynamics, the vertical turbulence coefficients of the three model simulations are compared in Fig. 11. For the comparison, the water column was divided into two layers: the first layer is obtained by integrating from the surface to 75 m depth and is representative of the mixed layer; the second layer, integrated from 75 m depth towards the bottom is representative of the bottom layer. The logarithm of the ratio of the vertical turbulent coefficients indicates that the semi-diurnal component plays a minor role in the vertical turbulence in both layers. In the mixed layer, the introduction of the tides results in an overall reduction in vertical mixing (Fig. 11a). This is due to the increased stratification as a result of the increased surface heat gain deriving from the introduction of tides (Fig. 12a and associated discussion in Sect. 3.5). Only in the areas surrounding Malta, the near-surface vertical mixing is reduced. This is probably a consequence of surface current shifts due to the effect of the tides. In the large area north of Malta, the change in vertical mixing is probably due to the westward shifting induced by tides of the Atlantic Ionian Stream (Lermusiaux and Robinson 2001) and associated water masses. Although vertical mixing in the surface layer is almost halved in large areas of the model domain by the introduction of tides, it remains sufficiently large to ensure layer homogeneity. Below the mixed layer depth, the increased vertical mixing deriving from the introduction of the tides strongly follows the bathymetric features. In the deeper areas of the model domain, vertical mixing is unaltered by the introduction of the tides. The semi-diurnal tidal component clearly plays a minor role in vertical mixing. Both in the surface and deep layers, positive and negative values of the logarithmic of the vertical turbulence coefficient ratio alternates geographically. Spatial scales in the surface layer, suggest the effect of semi-diurnal tides is to shift the large-scale currents, while in the deeper layers the semi-diurnal tide effect is more on sub-mesoscale features distribution.\n\n3.5 Heat balance and impact on the water mass characteristics\n\nThe overall effect of barotropic and baroclinic tides throughout the model domain is summarized in Fig. 12. The enhanced vertical mixing acts in the direction of removing heat from the surface to warm the deep layers. Despite the relaxation to the satellite SST, the reduced surface temperature and the larger surface currents generate an increase in downward heat flux, which is due to the bulk formulation we use to calculate the air-sea fluxes. The top panel in Fig. 12 shows that the total surface heat flux difference between the simulations with and without tides is constantly about 2 Wm−2 after 10 days of spin-up. The surface heat flux difference between the simulation with all tidal components switched on and that with only the diurnal components is negligible. The surface heat flux is calculated as:\n\n$${Q}_{T}=\\frac{1}{A}\\oint \\left({Q}_{s}-{Q}_{l}-{Q}_{h}-{Q}_{e}\\right)dA$$\n\n(5)\n\nwhere A is the area of our model domain, Qs, Ql, Qh, and Qe are the incoming shortwave radiation, the net longwave radiation, the sensible and the latent heat fluxes respectively, all computed according to Large and Yeager (2004).\n\nThis means that the ocean is absorbing heat from the atmosphere to warm its interior. In their barotropic and baroclinic forms, tides do not significantly alter the net volume transport across the open lateral boundaries (Fig. 12b). Their main effect is to introduce an oscillation of the volume flux at semidiurnal tidal frequency. However, the flows across each of the open lateral boundaries are equally amplified by the tides and compensate for each other. This is especially true for the eastern and western open lateral boundaries corresponding to the main tidal propagation direction. Recalling that the mean transport in the intermediate and deep layers is from east to west (Lermusiaux and Robinson 2001), to understand the effects of the introduced dynamics on the water mass properties we analyse the tidal effect on the outflow at the western open boundary of the domain. The last three bottom panels of Fig. 12 show, respectively, the western boundary outgoing heat flux, the averaged temperature of the outgoing water, and the outgoing volume flux computed as follows:\n\n$${HF}_{w}=\\underset{y1}{\\overset{y2}{\\int }}\\underset{-H}{\\overset{\\eta }{\\int }}\\left(u\\cdot T\\right) dzdy$$\n\n(6)\n\n$${T}_{ow}=\\frac{1}{A}\\underset{y1}{\\overset{y2}{\\int }}\\underset{-H}{\\overset{\\eta }{\\int }}T dzdy$$\n\n(7)\n\n$${V}_{ow}=\\frac{1}{A}\\underset{y1}{\\overset{y2}{\\int }}\\underset{-H}{\\overset{\\eta }{\\int }}u dzdy$$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere all the integrals and A, the area of the transect, are computed at each time-step only where the zonal velocity is negative (outgoing).\n\nThe addition of tidal forcing causes an increase in lateral heat flux at the western boundary (\\({HF}_{w})\\), which varies at diurnal frequency. The increase in lateral heat flux is the combination of two factors: the increase in horizontal volume flux due to barotropic and baroclinic tides (\\({V}_{ow})\\), and the increase in the deeper layers temperature (\\({T}_{ow})\\) due to the increase in surface fluxes and vertical mixing.\n\nAnalysing the horizontal maps of baroclinic transport integrated from 150 m depth to the seafloor and averaged over the period 4–12 November (Fig. 13a), we note that the introduction of the tides does not change the weekly averaged circulation characteristics in the area (Fig. 13b). In addition to differences in the positions of small structures mainly in the interior of the model domain, the main differences between the two simulations are in the narrowing of the strong inflow along the eastern boundary and the intensification of the outflow in the north-western sector of the model domain (Fig. 13b). On the other hand, the effects of internal tides on horizontal transport and vertical mixing become clear when comparing the vertically integrated temperature and salinity (from 150 m depth to the bottom). The bottom panels of Fig. 12 show the differences in temperature and salinity averaged over the same temporal window and integrated from 150 m depth to the sea floor, between simulations with and without tidal forcing. It can be seen that the north-western area of the domain is characterized by warmer temperatures, while the south-eastern region has lower temperatures and higher salinity. The first area is downstream of the main propagation path of the internal wave. It corresponds to the main outflow region and includes waters that were modified by the induced internal tidal mixing as they crossed the model domain from east to west. The changes in the eastern sector of the modal domain are probably due to the interaction with deeper water.\n\nFinally, to examine the vertical structure of the differences, we chose a meridional section within our model domain (Fig. 1) and compared temperature and salinity characteristics averaged over the same week. The differences in temperature and salinity along the section are shown in Fig. 14. Model results are presented below 150 m, for clarity."
