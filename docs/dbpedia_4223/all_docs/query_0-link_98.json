They go on strike, I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say: It’s okay, you’re all gone. You’re all gone. So every one of you is gone.”\n\nThe union said that threatening to fire workers for striking is illegal, given that all workers have protected rights to strike under U.S. federal labor law.\n\n“When we say Donald Trump is a slave, this is what we mean. When we say that Trump is against everything our union stands for, that’s what we mean,” Fain said in a press release announcing the charges.\n\n“Donald Trump will always be on the side of workers standing up for themselves and he will always be on the side of billionaires like Elon Musk,” Fain said. “Both Trump and Musk want working-class people to sit down and shut up, and they openly laugh about it. It’s disgusting, illegal and totally predictable from these two clowns.”\n\nMusk has previously been reprimanded for comments made on X, formerly Twitter. In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered Musk to delete a tweet in which he threatened workers for trying to organize a union, finding that the tweet violated federal labor law. Musk is still appealing the ruling, while in separate cases he has made arguments against labor law violations claiming the National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional.\n\nTrump has a long history of opposing unions and rolling back workers’ rights during his first presidential term.\n\n“It’s trying to expose more than anything else politically what Donald Trump means in terms of workers, as well as Musk,” Wilma Liebman, a former NLRB chairwoman under Barack Obama, told Reuters. “Everyone knows that NLRB remedies are toothless to begin with, but it’s not so much for the remedy as it is to send both a political message and an organizing message.”\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/13/uaw-union-charge-trump-elon-musk-interview\n\nIran rejects Western call not to launch retaliatory strike against Israel-The GuardianTue Aug 13 2024 18.38\n\nTehran blames country for killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iranian capital\n\nIran has rejected Western calls not to retaliate against Israel over the killing in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader, late last month.\n\n“Such demands are devoid of political logic, are totally contrary to the principles and rules of international law and are an excessive demand,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said.\n\nA report Tuesday by the official IRNA news agency said President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a telephone conversation late Monday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said the West’s silence on the “unprecedented inhuman crime” in Gaza and Israeli attacks elsewhere in the Middle East is “irresponsible” and encourages Israel to jeopardize regional and global security.\n\nUS orders strike group to speed up deployment in Middle East amid fears of Iran attack on Israel\n\nRead more\n\nIran and its allies accused Israel of assassinating Haniyeh on July 31 during a visit to the Iranian capital for the inauguration of Pezeshkian as president. Just a few hours earlier, an Israeli attack in Beirut killed a senior commander of Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon. Israel has not officially commented on its alleged role in Haniyeh’s death.\n\nWestern diplomats have been scrambling to prevent a major conflagration in the Middle East, where tensions are already high because of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe White House has warned that a “significant set of attacks” from Iran and its allies is possible as early as this week and has sent fighter jets, anti-missile warships and a guided missile submarine to the region to support Israel.\n\nAnalysts say Iran will almost certainly respond to Israeli attacks, but will try to avoid triggering all-out war.\n\nIn April, two weeks after two Iranian generals were killed in an attack on Tehran’s embassy in Syria, Iran launched hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles toward Israel, damaging two air bases. Almost all of the weapons were shot down before reaching their targets.\n\n“Iran wants its response to be much more effective than the April 13 attack,” said Farzin Nadimi, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East policy.\n\nOne option for Iran would be to rely on its proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Gaza. However, with the exception of Hezbollah, the various members of Tehran’s “axis of resistance” may not have the capacity to inflict serious damage on Israel.\n\nHamas launched two rockets from Gaza on Tuesday for the first time in months at Israel’s commercial center Tel Aviv, but no casualties were reported. One fell into the sea and the other landed on Israeli territory, the Israeli military said.\n\nAsked Tuesday whether he thought Iran might back down from a retaliatory strike if a cease-fire in Gaza is reached, Joe Biden said, “That is my expectation.”\n\nA new round of cease-fire talks is expected to begin on Thursday, although expectations for a deal are low and Hamas officials have reportedly questioned their participation or the talks going ahead.\n\nThe far-right parties in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ruling coalition strongly oppose any pause in hostilities in Gaza.\n\nOn Monday, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the ultra-nationalist national security minister, defied long-standing rules to lead hundreds of Israelis chanting Jewish hymns and performing religious rituals in the elevated compound in Jerusalem’s Old City, known as al-Haram al-Sharif , to Muslims.\n\nUnder a long-standing but fragile agreement known as the status quo, Jews can visit the site but cannot pray there. The compound is the third holiest site in Islam and the holiest for Jews, who call it the Temple Mount.\n\nThe deliberately provocative act appeared designed to disrupt future negotiations. In a video filmed inside the compound, Ben-Gvir reaffirmed his opposition to any pause in the Gaza war. “We have to win and not go to Doha or Cairo negotiations,” the minister said.\n\nNetanyahu’s office said Ben-Gvir’s visit “deviated from the status quo” and that Israel’s policy on the Temple Mount remained unchanged.\n\nThe growing danger of a wider confrontation with Iran and its proxies comes amid the continuing Israeli assault on Gaza, where Hamas-led health ministry officials said nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict erupted in October.\n\nThe war began after Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israeli communities that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The militants have also captured 251 people, 111 of whom are still being held captive in Gaza, although the Israeli army says 39 have died.\n\nPressure for a ceasefire in Gaza has increased since emergency services in the Hamas-ruled territory said an Israeli air strike on Saturday killed 93 people at a school sheltering displaced Palestinians. Israel said it targeted militants operating from the school and mosque.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/13/iran-rejects-western-plea-not-to-launch-retaliatory-attack-against-israel\n\nRussian authorities rush to crack down on week-long Ukrainian incursion in Kursk-The Guardian,Tue Aug 13 2024 19.09\n\nMixed messages from leaders as Kremlin tries to downplay significance of events\n\nThe Russian authorities are struggling to bring the situation in Kursk under control, a week after Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack in the region that left a chunk of Russian territory under Kiev’s control.\n\nRussia on Tuesday used rockets, drones and air strikes in a bid to reclaim the territory, with a senior commander saying Kiev’s advance had ended even as the evacuation of residents from border areas continued.\n\n“The enemy’s uncontrolled movement has already been stopped,” said Gen. Apti Alaudinov, commander of Akhmat, a unit of Chechen special forces. “The enemy is already aware that the blitzkrieg he planned did not work.”\n\nHowever, Ukrainian forces still controlled many settlements, with the Kremlin trying to play down the significance of the events.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Kiev had no interest in a long-term occupation of the region. “Unlike Russia, Ukraine has no need for other people’s property. Ukraine is not interested in occupying the territory of the Kursk region, but we want to protect the lives of our people,” Heorhii Tykhyi told reporters in Kiev. He said Russia has launched more than 2,000 strikes on Ukraine in the region in the past month.\n\nRussia quickly sent reinforcements to the region, and Kiev claimed on Tuesday that some units from the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson sectors of the frontline in southern Ukraine have been redeployed to the Kursk region. Dmytro Lykhoviy, a Ukrainian army spokesman, made the claim to Politico, though he said it was a “relatively small” number of troops involved.\n\nA Russian state television report showed images from the Kursk region of destroyed Ukrainian equipment. “There was a big battle here yesterday,” said Yuri Polskoi, head of the village of Giryi, dressed in full armor. He pointed to the charred wreckage of cars and houses in the village deep in the Russian Russian countryside. The television report claimed that Ukrainian forces were hit and pushed back as soon as they approached the village.\n\nKiev has not publicly stated the ultimate purpose of its surprise campaign of Russian breakthroughs, which has been variously assessed as a morale boost after a long period of being on the back foot in the face of Russia’s heavy-handed attacks, or as a potential bargaining chip to be used in negotiations.\n\nA Western intelligence official said Kiev didn’t share specific details of the operation with allies until well after it was underway, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, and there was little criticism of Kiev from friendly capitals. “Ukraine has every right to wage a war so as to paralyze Russia’s aggressive intentions as effectively as possible,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday.\n\nUkraine has launched raids on Russian territory before, but they were brief and seemed largely intended to have a psychological effect. This attack, with its sustained seizure of territory, is different. But Vladimir Putin, in his public comments, has been keen to downplay the significance of what was the biggest incursion by foreign troops into Russia since World War II.\n\nOn Monday, in a televised meeting with defense officials, the acting head of the Kursk region, Alexei Smirnov, told the Russian president that 28 settlements in the region were under Ukrainian control and that Kiev’s troops had penetrated up to 12 km inside Russia along a 40-km stretch of the border.\n\nPutin interrupted the official, telling him to leave such matters to the military. “You can tell us about the socio-economic situation and helping people,” he said. Smirnov replied that 120,000 people have already been evacuated from their homes and another 60,000 are waiting for assistance. In neighboring Belgorod region, another 11 000 people have been evacuated, local officials said.\n\nThe Kremlin’s messaging appeared confusing at times, while mentioning the seriousness of the border incursion and claiming there was no cause for concern. “Overall, the situation remains extremely difficult but under control,” an article in the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper wrote on Monday, summarizing the mood.\n\nRussia has designated its response as an “anti-terrorist operation”, the same name given to the war in Chechnya in the early 2000s, which allows for the involvement of the FSB security services and the Rosgvardia national guard, along with the army. The initial response seemed slow and poorly coordinated. Ukraine claims to have captured hundreds of Russian prisoners of war and to have penetrated some areas with little resistance.\n\n“This war has weakened Russia’s borders, the military is engaged in Ukraine and not immediately available to defend border regions, and FSB border troops are not supported,” wrote Dara Massicot, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, on X.\n\nRussian opposition politicians who watched from abroad expressed horror at the incursion but blamed Putin. “What is happening in Kursk is terrible. From the first day of the war, we said that Putin would bring death and destruction to Russian territory and that our country would be forced to pay a heavy price for his bloody adventurism, and unfortunately that is what has happened,” said Ilya Yashin, an opposition politician released from prison earlier this month in a prisoner exchange.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking on Monday night, compared the Kursk disaster to the sinking of the Kursk submarine in 2000, in the early months of Putin’s reign over Russia. At the time, more than 100 Russian sailors died, and Putin’s clumsy and inadequate response was roundly criticized. “Twenty-four years ago there was the Kursk catastrophe, the symbolic beginning of his regime, and now it’s the end for him, and it’s Kursk all over again,” Zelenskiy said.\n\nBut with Ukrainian forces stretched along the long front line, the assault on Russia is a high risk for Ukraine and could jeopardize other areas of the front. Ukraine’s General Staff said Tuesday that Russian forces had launched 52 attacks in the past 24 hours around the city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, double the daily average number of attacks a week ago.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/13/russian-authorities-scramble-to-quell-ukraines-week-long-kursk-incursion\n\nUkraine war briefing: ‘A real dilemma’ for Putin in Kursk, says Joe Biden-The Guardian,Wed 14 Aug 2024 02.28\n\nEverything is going according to plan, Ukrainian commander Syrskyi tells Volodymyr Zelenskiy; soldiers recount how Russians failed to protect border. What we know on day 903\n\nSee all our coverage of the war in Ukraine\n\nUkraine’s invasion of Russia’s Kursk region has left Vladimir Putin facing a dilemma, US President Joe Biden said Tuesday. ” It creates a real dilemma for Putin, and we have been in direct, constant contact with the Ukrainians. That’s all I’ll say about it while it’s active.” Responding to questions from reporters in New Orleans, Biden said he had been briefed every four or five hours for the past six to eight days on the Ukrainian action.\n\nThe aim of the Ukrainian incursion in Kursk appears to be to force Russia to withdraw troops from Ukraine to defend Russian territory against the Ukrainian cross-border assault, a US official said on Tuesday, cited by Reuters news agency. A week after Ukrainian forces launched their surprise attack, Russian authorities are scrambling to bring the situation in Kursk under control, writes Shaun Walker. The Biden administration has insisted that it had no prior knowledge and was not involved in the operation.\n\nIn an explanatory piece using maps, images and photos, Peter Beaumont writes that Ukraine’s top military commander, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Monday that Ukraine controlled about 1,000 square kilometers of the Kursk region. The claim was largely confirmed by the Russian side. Alexei Smirnov, the acting governor of the Kursk region, told Russian President Vladimir Putin via video conference on Monday that Ukrainian forces controlled 28 Russian settlements, including towns and villages up to 18 miles (30 km) inside Russia.\n\nDan Sabbagh writes from the border between Ukraine’s Sumy and Russia’s Kursk regions, “The Sudzha crossing point is now about five miles (8 kilometers) from the current frontline inside the Russian Kursk region. At least for the time being, it remains in Ukrainian hands a week after the border incursion.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kiev’s forces have been rounding up Russian prisoners of war to be used as a “bargaining fund” for captured Ukrainian fighters. “Despite difficult and intense fighting, our forces continue to advance in the Kursk region, and our state’s ‘exchange fund’ is growing. Seventy-four settlements are under Ukrainian control,” Zelenskiy said.\n\nShown speaking via video link, Zelenskiy asked his top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, to develop the next “key steps” in the operation. “Everything is being executed according to the plan,” Syrskyi replied, without giving details.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Tuesday that Russia should be forced to attend a peace summit because it would not do so willingly. “Simple appeals to Russia don’t work, only a coercive toolkit works,” he said, meaning economic and diplomatic pressure as well as the Kursk invasion. Through actions inside Russia, Ukraine has solved the key problem of its own security. “This is the destruction of war infrastructure and the formation of so-called sanitary zones , so that Russia cannot use there … equipment that strikes deep into the territory of Ukraine.”\n\nUkrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy said on Tuesday that Kiev was not interested in “taking over” Russian territory and defended Ukraine’s actions as “absolutely legitimate.” “The sooner Russia agrees to restore a just peace … the sooner the raids by Ukrainian defense forces in Russia will cease.”\n\n“They didn’t protect the border,” a Ukrainian serviceman who took part in the offensive and identified himself as Ruzhyk told Agence France-Presse in the Sumy region. “All they had were anti-personnel mines scattered around the roadside trees and a few mines that they managed to quickly throw along the highways.” A 27-year-old team leader, who identified himself as Faraon, said, “We saw a lot of deaths in the first few days. It was terrifying at first, but then we got used to it. There were many dead,” he repeated, without giving details. Ukrainian military analyst Mykola Bielieskov told AFP: “Russia’s complacency prevailed. Russia assumed that since it had the initiative elsewhere, Ukraine would not dare to do the things we have seen.”\n\nAt the UN Security Council, Russia tried to attack Ukraine’s allies over the Kursk invasion, but was met with retorts about its own war of aggression against its neighbor. “We will not recognize the aggressor as a victim,” said senior Slovenian diplomat Klemen Ponikvar. “There is no doubt about the country that has committed numerous well-documented atrocities, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, on the sovereign territory of Ukraine,” said US diplomat Caleb Pine. “That country is Russia.” British diplomat Kate Jones said British allies “will never waver in our support for Ukraine” to ensure “a just and lasting peace based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law.” Diplomats from Syria, Belarus and North Korea spoke in support of Russia.\n\nRussian shelling has killed at least one civilian and wounded two others in Ukraine’s Sumy region, the local administration across the border in Kursk said.\n\nIt said 45 Russian attacks on the region were recorded on Tuesday, including guided bomb strikes, drone blasts and shelling. The Ukrainian military on Tuesday restricted the movement of civilians in a 20-kilometer (12-mile) zone along the northeastern border area.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/14/ukraine-war-briefing-real-dilemma-for-putin-in-kursk-says-joe-biden\n\nRussia-Ukraine war: Ukraine controls 74 settlements in Kursk region, says Zelenskiy – as it happened-The Guardian,11h ago19.31 CEST\n\nSummary\n\nUkraine controls 74 settlements in the Kursk region of southern Russia, its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an update on Tuesday. “Despite difficult and intense fighting, our forces continue to advance in the Kursk region,” Zelenskiy wrote in a social media post. “74 communities are under Ukrainian control, where inspections and stabilization measures are being carried out.”\n\nUkraine said on Tuesday that it has no interest in seizing territory in the Russian Kursk region and that its major cross-border incursion would complicate Russian military logistics and its ability to send more units to fight in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman’s comments come a week after Kiev’s forces launched a cross-border attack in the Kursk region of western Russia, an attack that Ukraine says saw its forces take control of 1,000 square kilometers of territory. To read more about Ukraine’s incursion into Russia, see our detailed analysis here.\n\nSome Russian military units fighting in Ukraine are likely facing drinking water shortages, according to the British Ministry of Defense on Tuesday. Damage inflicted during “ongoing Russian strikes against utility infrastructure is now almost certainly reducing water supplies,” an update said.\n\nRussia said it summoned a senior Moldovan diplomat on Tuesday to express its “serious concern” over media reports – denied by Moldova – about the possible deployment in the country of F-16 fighter jets supplied by the West to Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Moscow is alarmed by speculation that F-16 jets could be deployed on Moldovan airfields and used to launch attacks on Russian territory.\n\nThe Moldovan Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Chisinau has no plans to host planes destined for Ukraine, after the Russian Foreign Ministry referred to reports that F-16 jets would be based in Moldova. “Moldova does not and will not host weapons and military equipment, including aircraft destined for Ukraine,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nAccording to one report, Russia has trained its navy to target sites deep in Europe using nuclear-capable missiles in a potential conflict with NATO. Files consulted by the Financial Times and compiled between 2008 and 2014 include a list of missile targets that can carry either conventional warheads or tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Russian military is stepping up its attacks in eastern Ukraine, military officials said on Tuesday, even as Kremlin forces try to halt a stunning week-long incursion into Russia by Kiev troops. Ukraine’s General Staff said Tuesday that Russian troops have launched 52 attacks in the past 24 hours in the Pokrovsk area, a town in Ukraine’s Donetsk region that lies close to the front line.\n\nTwo people were killed after Ukrainian forces shelled a bus carrying civilians in the Russian-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk on Tuesday, the Tass news agency reported, citing Russian-appointed local authorities. Russian-appointed officials previously said more than 30 people were wounded in the attack.\n\nDonald Trump has said Joe Biden is to blame for Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine. In an interview Monday night with billionaire Elon Musk, Trump claimed that his “strong” relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin could have prevented the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry says it stopped an attempt by Ukraine to push deeper into the Kursk region and retaliated against Kiev forces in the Sumy region. “Strikes by army aviation and unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as artillery fire, prevented attempts by enemy mobile groups to penetrate with armored vehicles deeper into Russian territory in the areas of the populated areas of Obshchy Kolodez, Snagost, Kauchuk and Alekseevsky,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in quotes picked up by the Interfax news agency.\n\nRomania’s navy carried out a controlled explosion of a drifting mine on the Black Sea coast, the Defense Ministry said. Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey have a joint task force to defuse stray mines that began floating in the Black Sea after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe UN human rights agency is concerned about the possible impact of recent military developments in the war between Russia and Ukraine, its spokesman said in response to a question on Ukraine’s recent cross-border attack on the Kursk region. “Wherever military operations take place by either side, the protection of civilians and civilian objects in accordance with international humanitarian law must be the absolute priority,” the spokesman told a briefing.\n\nUkraine is restricting the movement of civilians within a 20-kilometer (12-mile) zone in a northeastern region bordering Russia, Kiev’s General Staff said on Tuesday, as its troops push deeper into Russian territory in a week-long surprise offensive. The measure, which is being applied in parts of the Sumy region on the border with Russia’s Kursk region, was necessary because of an “increase in the intensity of hostilities” and the activation of Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the area, it said.\n\nRussian drones attacked energy infrastructure in the Chernihiv region of northern Ukraine overnight, national grid operator Ukrenergo said on Tuesday. Ukrenergo said power has been restored to industrial and domestic consumers in some areas of the Chernihiv region affected by power outages after the attack, according to Ukrenergo’s statement shared via the Telegram messaging app.\n\nUkraine on Tuesday bombarded two Russian regions with drones as its ground forces attempted to breach defensive lines in a bid to carve out even more territory, in its biggest attack on Russian territory since the start of the war. Ukrainian soldiers crossed the Russian border about 530 kilometers (530 kilometers) southwest of Moscow a week ago in a surprise attack that President Vladimir Putin said was aimed at improving Kiev’s negotiating position ahead of possible talks and slowing the advance of Russian forces along the rest of the front.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia’s foreign intelligence services accused Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of taking “insane” steps that threaten to escalate the war far beyond his country, according to a report by Russia’s state news service RIA. It comes as Ukraine’s top military commander says his forces now control 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of the Kursk region, the Associated Press reports.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/aug/13/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-volodymyr-zelenskiy-vladimir-putin-latest-news-updates?filterKeyEvents=true#filter-toggle-desktop\n\nPutin has assigned his former bodyguard to solve the Ukrainian problem in Kursk.

Photo Credit: Moscow defense ministry\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Aleksei Diumin (52), a former governor of the Tula region and now secretary of Russia’s State Council, as the person in charge of the military operation to push Ukrainian troops out of the Russian Kursk region, according to The Moscow Times, which cites the Telegram channel “Management Z Kursk”, Agerpres reported.\n\nDiumin, Putin’s former bodyguard in the past, will be tasked with coordinating the Russian military’s actions in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops broke through last Tuesday and have since advanced more than 35 kilometers deep into Russian territory and captured dozens of towns.\n\nAfter General Valery Gherasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, presented the situation in Kursk to the Russian head of state on August 7 in a positive manner, which was largely contradicted by most other reports of developments on the ground, Putin tasked Aleksandr Bortnikov, the head of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), to set up an anti-terrorist operation regime in the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions on the border with Ukraine and to take over the “anti-terrorist operation” in Kursk under his command.\n\nThe appointment of Diumin, who holds the rank of colonel-general, as the man in charge of managing the “Kursk situation” took many by surprise, especially as it comes less than a week after the FSB chief was given the task. However, pro-Kremlin military bloggers welcomed the appointment.\n\nWell-known pro-Kremlin military blogger Rybar described Diumin as someone who is part of “Putin’s team” and who, he writes, will “remove “appearances and start to solve the problem instead of trying to freeze it”.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, President Volodimir Zelenski said that Ukrainian forces had already taken control of 74 settlements in the Kursk region, according to Ukrainian TV station Kanal 24. Inspections and stabilization measures are being carried out there. Designing humanitarian solutions for these territories continues, he added.\n\nEarlier, the Russian military had reported that it was “thwarting” further Ukrainian attacks in the border region, which since August 6 has been the target of the biggest intrusion by a foreign army into Russian territory since World War II. Russian forces have used rockets, drones and air strikes in actions that a senior commander said halted Ukraine’s advance after the biggest assault on Russian sovereign territory since the start of the war in Ukraine, according to Reuters.\n\nThousands of Ukrainian soldiers crossed the border with Russia a week ago in a surprise assault that Russian President Vladimir Putin said was aimed at improving Kiev’s negotiating position ahead of possible talks and slowing the advance of Russian forces along the frontline, particularly in Donetsk.\n\nhttps://www.defenseromania.ro/putin-si-a-desemnat-fosta-garda-de-corp-sa-rezolve-problema-ucraineana-la-kurs-cine-e-aleksei-diumin-noul-responsabil-cu-operatiunea-kursk_629703.html\n\nLukashenko sends rocket and artillery crews to Russia to prepare for ‘use in combat’-Date published: 13.08.2024 21:39\n\nA new possible escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict comes from Belarus.\n\nThe Belarusian Defense Ministry announced on the morning of August 13 that some of its missile and artillery subunits are heading to Russia for combat training.\n\n“The crews of missile and artillery units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus have left for the Russian Federation to practice, in a polygon, the problems of combat use,” the Belarusian Defense Ministry said on Telegram.\n\nBelarusian servicemen arrived at the Ashuluk firing range in the Astrakhan region with an Il-76MD aircraft, according to an August 12 statement from the Minsk Defense Ministry.\n\nAt Ashuluk, the Russian Armed Forces have one of the largest missile training and testing ranges.\n\nBelarussian servicemen will be trained by combat firings on ground-to-ground missile systems and MLRS in the service of the Belarusian military.\n\n“The units will conduct training through combat firings that will be carried out on missile systems and MLRS (reactive missile launchers – author’s note) systems in the service of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus,” the press release added.\n\nThe Belarusian Armed Forces are equipped with Tocika-U and Iskander surface-to-surface missile systems, and as MLRS systems they are equipped with Grad, Uragan, Smerch, Polonaise and Polonaise-M types, the last two with a maximum missile flight range of 200 km and 290 km respectively. Polonaise and Polonaise-M are manufactured in Belarus under a Chinese license.\n\nOn August 12, Belarusian Defense Minister Lieutenant General Viktor Khrenin was in Russia for the Armia-24 forum. Khrenin met with his Russian counterpart, Andrei Belousov, with whom he discussed “our pressing problems, the problems of ensuring the security of the Union state,” according to the Belarusian Defense Ministry.\n\nThe presence on Russian territory of Belarusian missile systems and MLRS opens the possibility that they could be used against Ukrainian troops under the Russian flag.\n\nAt present, almost all Russian surface-to-surface missile units are deployed in Kharkiv, Donbass and southern Ukraine and are not available to participate in stopping Kiev’s offensive in the Kursk region.\n\nThe Russian forces fighting in Kursk are inexperienced and, in addition, are facing, without air and missile support, some of the elite Ukrainian units. For these Russian units fighting in Kursk, the arrival of missile support would probably enable them to halt the advance of Ukrainian forces.\n\nFor the Ukrainian military, however, the missile threat would be a major one against which they could not defend themselves with what they have now.\n\nOne response option for the Ukrainians would be to use Western missiles to hit Russian launch positions located hundreds of kilometers from the Kursk front. But in the past few days both Washington, London and Paris have reiterated their stance not to allow Kiev to strike deep into Russian territory with their weapons. This could force Ukraine to withdraw its troops from Kursk sooner than it had intended.\n\nThe possibility of Ukrainian servicemen remaining under Russian missile fire is extremely risky if the offensive operation in Kursk were to move from the maneuver to the positional phase. Some of the best Ukrainian brigades could be decimated in Kursk if the West does not change its stance on the use of its missiles.\n\nIn any case, for the time being, Russia’s appeal to Belarus for missile support confirms the inability of the Russian General Staff to handle the situation in Kursk with its own forces.\n\nhttps://www.defenseromania.ro/lukasenko-trimite-echipaje-de-rachete-si-artilerie-in-rusia-pentru-a-se-pregati-de-utilizare-in-lupta_629705.html\n\nThe UK has not allowed Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles in the incursion in the Russian region of Kursk-Date published: 13.08.2024 16:21\n\nGraphic image of the UK’s long-range air-to-ground Storm Shadow long-range air-to-ground missile. Source: DefenseExpress\n\nThe British government has not granted Ukraine permission to use the British long-range Storm Shadow missile in Kiev’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, The Telegraph reported on August 13, citing an undisclosed British government source. “There has been no change,” the source reportedly told The Telegraph.\n\nDespite previous statements by former and current British officials, London has not yet allowed Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow missiles, which have a range of up to 250 kilometers (150 miles), to strike targets on Russian territory. Kiev has reportedly been using Storm Shadow missiles against Russian positions in occupied Ukrainian territories such as Crimea.\n\nThe news comes shortly after President Volodimir Zelenski said on August 12 that he had instructed officials and diplomats to present a list of actions needed to get permission from his partners to use long-range weapons to protect Ukrainian territory.\n\nSuch permission could play a key role in the unprecedented incursion by Ukrainian troops launched in the Russian Kursk region on Aug. 6.\n\nKiev has said its forces control about 1,000 square kilometers of the Russian region, but refrained from providing other details, such as a possible use of Western weapons in the operation.\n\nRussian media claimed that Ukraine deployed US-supplied Bradley armored vehicles and German-supplied Marder armored vehicles. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.\n\nBoth Washington and Berlin have previously allowed Ukraine to use certain weapons “just across the border” for self-defense, but have banned the use of long-range missiles inside Russia.\n\nThe Kursk region shares a 245-kilometer border with Ukraine’s Sumy region, which has faced daily Russian attacks since its liberation from Russian occupation in April 2022.\n\nAccording to the chairman of the Bundestag’s defense committee, Marcus Faber, it would be “completely legitimate” if Ukraine deployed German-supplied equipment such as Leopard 2 tanks to the Kursk region.\n\nIn a statement issued to Politico on August 9, the German Foreign Ministry said that “Ukraine has the right to self-defense enshrined in international law,” adding that the principle of self-defense “is not limited to its own territory.”\n\nThe United States said it had not changed its position on Ukraine’s use of American weapons, but added that the incursion into the Kursk region was “in line with (its) policy”.\n\nResponding to a question about the incursion and whether Ukraine can use US-supplied weapons, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh replied that the US “has supported Ukraine from the beginning to defend against attacks coming from across the border”.\n\nUkraine is taking steps “to protect itself from attacks” and operates “within the framework of US policy on where our weapons, our systems, our capabilities can operate,” Singh said.\n\nRussian Telegram channels claimed on August 9 that a column of Russian military vehicles and personnel was destroyed in the village of Oktyabrskoe in the Kursk region following a HIMARS attack. The claim could not be independently verified.\n\nUkraine reportedly used HIMARS against Russian territory for the first time in early June in the context of a Russian invasion of the Kharkiv region.\n\nhttps://www.defenseromania.ro/marea-britanie-nu-a-permis-ucrainei-utilizarea-rachetelor-storm-shadow-in-cadrul-incursiunii-din-regiunea-rusa-kursk_629699.html\n\nMApN: Suspicious object washed ashore in the area of the Chituc Grind is an anti-desert mine, YaRM-type-Date of update: 13.08.2024 11:\n\nOn Tuesday, August 13, the Romanian Naval Forces activated a team of EOD divers from the Center 39 Scafandri to intervene in the area of Grindului Chituc, following the receipt, around 9.30 am, of a report from the Inspectorate for Emergency Situations Constanța, regarding a suspicious object beached on the shore in this area.\n\nFrom the examination of the photographs taken on the spot, the object is most likely an anti- anti-desantation mine of the YaRM type.\n\nThe area is currently being monitored and secured by representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in order to limit any danger.\n\nEOD military divers from the Navy will intervene as soon as possible, in accordance with specific procedures, to classify and neutralize the mine.\n\nThe YaRM mine is normally deployed in shallow coastal waters, on beaches and on the banks of rivers and lakes to counter landing craft and other amphibious vehicles.\n\nThanks to the built-in anchoring mechanism, the mine can be deployed in waters between 1 and 12 meters deep, usually by a small boat. The mine is designed to float below the surface between 0.1 and 0.3 meters deep.\n\nThe characteristic wire cross on the naval mine is the warhead trigger. Without it, the weapon can pass as an ordinary gas tank, which makes it no less dangerous.\n\nThe YaRM mine has a diameter of 275 mm, a height of 510 mm with the anchor part and a total height of 900 mm with the cruciform tilt rod attachment. It has a welded metal body, the welds being slightly visible in the photos.\n\nThe standard Soviet-era YaRM is painted gray with black markings, although there may be many variations.\n\nhttps://www.defenseromania.ro/mapn-obiectul-suspect-esuat-pe-tarm-in-zona-grindului-chituc-este-o-mina-anti-desant-de-tipul-yarm_629694.html\n\nWhat is the difference between GNSS and PNT?\n\nThese two acronyms are often heard in connection with satellite positioning and navigation, but there are some important differences between them.\n\nGNSS and PNT are acronyms that often seem to be used interchangeably when talking about satellite positioning and navigation. But they’re not the same thing, and as location-based technologies make increasing inroads into all of our lives, it’s worth understanding the differences between them.\n\nWhat is GNSS?\n\nLet’s start with GNSS. As an acronym, it stands for Global Navigation Satellite System. Back in the 1970s, when the US Global Positioning System (GPS) was the only global navigation satellite system in the sky, there was no need for another umbrella term to describe its function.\n\nBut over the years, GPS has been joined in orbit by three other GNSSs. Russia’s GLONASS became operational in 1985, Europe’s Galileo in 2014 and China’s BeiDou-3 in 2018. You might still hear “GPS” used as shorthand for any global navigation satellite system, but there is growing recognition now that GNSS is the correct term to describe this type of service.\n\nFeatures that all GNSS have in common\n\nAlthough there are differences between them, the four established GNSS systems share several common characteristics.\n\nFor starters, they all provide the same fundamental service. The signals transmitted by their satellites contain data that allow a receiver to calculate its position, navigate from one intermediate point to another, and mark events with a fine degree of accuracy (usually plus or minus 10 nanoseconds).\n\nAll four GNSS systems provide freely available signals for civilian (consumer and commercial) use, as well as encrypted, high-precision signals for government-authorized users and sensitive applications. Civilian signals are used by receivers embedded in a wide range of devices – from smartphones and fitness trackers to cars, trains, ships, airplanes and drones, while encrypted signals are used to coordinate nation-state activities and protect critical functions.\n\nStatic infrastructure, such as electrical substations and cell phone towers, also use GNSS signals for the precise timing data they provide, which is important for synchronizing operations in power grids and wireless communication networks.\n\nEach GNSS has a constellation of 24+ operational satellites in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), plus spare parts, deployed in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and all provide global coverage that allows a position to be calculated by a trilateration process. In the case of China’s BeiDou-3, these MEO satellites are also backed up by satellites in geostationary (GEO) and inclined geosynchronous (IGSO) geosynchronous orbits.\n\nWhat is PNT? How does it differ from GNSS?\n\nPNT stands for Positioning, Navigation and Timing and is the term used to describe any technology, service or system designed to enable positioning, navigation and timing capabilities across the full range of relevant applications.\n\nGNSS is therefore an example – indeed the classic example – of a PNT service. However, GNSS is not the only service that supports precise positioning, navigation and synchronization. In many PNT systems today, a GNSS receiver is just one of a number of sensors and services that together enable the kind of precise, accurate, robust and resilient positioning needed for equipment such as autonomous vehicles.\n\nNon-GNSS PNT sensors and services\n\nPNT sensors and services that can complement and augment GNSS include:\n\n– Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), Ground-Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS), and Regional Navigation Systems: there is a wide range of services that use additional signals, data, and algorithms to increase the accuracy and precision of GNSS-derived positioning. These range from regional satellite navigation systems such as NavIC in India and EGNOS in Europe, to terrestrial systems such as Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP).\n\n– Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs): Also known as dead reckoning sensors, these include gyroscopes, accelerometers and altimeters. They provide a relative positioning service, allowing a PNT system to continue to compute a position when the connection to a global positioning system (such as GNSS) is lost. However, drift in these systems means they require calibration by an accurate global positioning system at regular intervals.\n\n– Oscillators: Crystal oscillators are built-in timing components that can maintain accurate time for a given period, but begin to drift if not regularly synchronized with an accurate time source such as GNSS.\n\n– Cameras: Camera vision is used in autonomous vehicles to detect obstacles, with the PNT system correlating data with inputs from other sensors to calculate its position relative to the vehicle.\n\n– Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR): Similar to camera vision, LiDAR sensors can detect objects near the vehicle – data that can be used to calculate how far the vehicle is from the object and where the object is relative to the vehicle.\n\n– Wi-Fi and cellular: Radio signals from known Wi-Fi access points and cell towers (4G and 5G) can be used to determine position with reasonable accuracy. Wi-Fi positioning is particularly useful in indoor locations where weak GNSS signals often cannot penetrate.\n\nSource: https://www.spirent.com/blogs/whats-the-difference-between-gnss-and-pnt\n\nDoes the Chayka (eLoran) compensate? – Armada International\n\nBlog editor’s note: Another article about Russia using its version of eLoran in areas where GNSS is jammed or likely to be jammed.\n\nUkraine is certainly one of those places. I’ve seen reports of localized jamming by Russian troops in an effort to protect themselves from GPS guided weapons and other reports of more widespread jamming disrupting signals for air traffic in northern Europe.\n\nAlways good to have options, especially when it comes to essential PNT. Too bad the Russians, Chinese and Iranians are the ones with the options in this case. Not the US and NATO.\n\n— We have been asked to note that the description of the Chyaka/Loran coverage in the article below is incorrect. a more accurate description, based on official Russian sources, is in the image at the top of this post.\n\nChayka is compensating?\n\nRussia can use its Chayka radio-navigation system to flank GNSS jamming in the Ukrainian theater of operations.\n\nRussia’s RSDN-10 Chayka system is like the former LORAN-C radio navigation architecture. LORAN used a global network of transmitters, located mainly on the coasts. It exploited an elegant and simple principle. All radio waves travel at 161,595 knots per second (299,274 kilometers per second), the speed of light. LORAN stations work in pairs. Maps showed where the stations were located and the distance between them. Each station transmitted a single radio pulse every half second at a frequency of 100 KHz. If a ship or aircraft was exactly halfway between the two LORAN transmitters, the pulses from each arrived at the same time. If the ship or aircraft was closer to one, it received the pulses from the closer transmitter slightly earlier than the pulses from the farther one. By calculating the time difference between these two pulses, you could calculate the position relative to the transmitters.\n\nSource: https://rntfnd.org/2022/04/12/chayka-eloran-compensates-armada-international/\n\nPNT Vision 2035 – A must read: GPS World\n\nAn interview with ESA’s NAVAC President Luis Mayo\n\nBy Dana A. Goward\n\nIn June, the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Navigation Support and Innovation Program Advisory Committee (NAVISP) published the “PNT Vision 2035” document. It provides an interesting overview of the state of PNT and where it will be a decade from now.\n\nAccording to the ESA website, the main findings of the paper include:\n\n– Increasing reliance on PNT services – especially for consumers and autonomous solutions. Precise timing remains a critical use case, especially in telecommunications and energy distribution.\n\n– Geopolitical and technological challenges: Increasing cyber-attacks, jamming and spoofing, advances in AI, ML and quantum computing will have a significant impact. Anticipate new regulations.\n\n– The proliferation of connected devices (IoT), autonomous driving, advanced air mobility, smart grids, and autonomous vehicles will drive demand for resilient and robust PNTs.\n\n– Evolution of system architecture: Future PNT systems will use a combination of data sources, including multiple GNSS constellations, cellular networks (5G/6G), ground systems, augmentation systems and autonomous sensors. This ‘system of systems’ approach will improve performance and ensure independence from single points of failure.\n\n– Emerging technologies and sensor integration: Advances in space segment technologies, receiver designs and sensor integration, new signal patterns, flexible payloads, advanced clocks, inter-satellite links and higher power amplifiers are highlighted.\n\nWe spoke with Luis Mayo, president of NAVAC, to get his take on this seminal work.\n\nTo set the scene, what is NAVAC?\n\nLuis Mayo: NAVAC is a group of external PNT experts that ESA has assembled to provide independent advice on navigation issues, and in particular for NAVISP.\n\nWhere can official NAVAC advice be found?\n\nMayo: We conduct a NAVISP status review every two years. We present our recommendations as a conclusion of this assessment. In addition, our formal recommendations are collected in documents such as this white paper or in proposed changes or adjustments to program work plans.\n\nHow does ESA management view and react to NAVAC’s conclusions and recommendations? Are they implementing each recommendation?\n\nMayo: They are generally responsive. However, we are only an advisory body, so it’s up to them to take our recommendations on board. They often do that and use our advice to add weight to their proposal to the Navigation Program Board, but they don’t necessarily have to.\n\nNTP Vision 2035 is a substantial document. It has clearly involved some time and effort. Why was it written? Is it something the ESA asked for?\n\nMayo: The paper was the initiative of NAVAC members to inform the ESA 2025 Ministerial Conference. These are held every three years to define the roadmap for the next period. These meetings approve new European space programs, extensions or redirections of existing ones, and budgets.\n\nWe thought we could make a modest contribution to defining future ESA navigation programs.\n\nWhat did NAVAC find surprising or unexpected about the discoveries included in the vision?\n\nMayo: I would say we didn’t find anything too unexpected or surprising. These are the conclusion of several discussions on this topic over the last several years. I’ve just expressed them in a more articulate way.\n\nIn any case, and from my personal perspective, I would emphasize that this exercise has helped me to realize that the implementation of some of the most interesting or expected applications of PNT technologies, for example autonomous driving, depends on the development of many other technologies that may not necessarily be available in the medium term.\n\n“There is more to PNT than satellite navigation.”\n\nWhat are the three most important things policymakers should understand from the paper?\n\nMayo: First, many infrastructures or services critical to citizens’ daily lives depend on PNT technology.\n\nSecondly, that I cannot take for granted that GPS or Galileo services will always be available, let alone GLONASS or BeiDou. Satellite navigation systems are vulnerable and under constant threat. Enabling the secured PNT service is a necessity.\n\nAnd third, that PNT means more than satellite navigation. Other complementary or alternative technologies should not be abandoned. In fact, some of these technologies could even change the way we have traditionally conceived satellite navigation.\n\nWhat are the most important things policymakers should do to enable the necessary PNT by 2035?\n\nMayo: I think they need to support existing satellite navigation systems and encourage the development of new technologies and systems that improve the robustness of services. We have done a lot so far to provide PNT services globally. When you think about it, it’s truly marvelous what we have achieved so far. We cannot afford to lose what we have, but this has proved not to be enough. Policy makers should therefore continue to help develop new technologies and services that complement what we have, improve the quality of services and ensure their continued availability and integrity.\n\nIt should also look beyond the current volume of services. Space nations should be aware that they will need this type of technology to support future missions. The deployment of systems capable of providing PNT services beyond the current GNSS coverage is an absolute necessity to support such missions.\n\nThe vision says that the EU should consider no longer having access to GLONASS and BeiDou. There are a number of threats that are common to all GNSS. Why not consider losing access to all, either temporarily or permanently?\n\nWe have not considered a completely catastrophic situation such as losing access to all GNSSs in our vision. We understand that GPS, Galileo and eventually other constellation or augmentation systems will remain available and provide at least partial coverage for PNT services.\n\n“We should not forget that there is a clear case for investing in future PNT systems.”\n\nThe vision makes recommendations on mitigating interference, using AI and expanding the volume of GNSS services. What else should policy and technology makers take from the document and act on?\n\nMayo: We shouldnot forget that there is a clear case for investment in future PNT systems. ESA should keep pace with other foreign competitors that seem poised to increase their spending on these types of issues.\n\nThey also need to be aware that satellite navigation is not enough. We need to look for alternative and complementary systems to achieve the level of confidence we need in PNT solutions.\n\nQ: Can you think of all the PNT systems that China has implemented?\n\nMayo: I am really thinking about what we are not doing in Europe or the US. We need to build alternatives that may not have global reach, but that allow us to maintain essential PNT services that work at home.\n\n“Resilience … is a major concern.”\n\nResilience seems to be an important theme in the document, but was not the subject of a specific recommendation. Could you talk about that?\n\nMayo: Resilience is pervasive throughout the document. This is a major concern. We need to find a way to build a system of systems that is capable of delivering a reliable PNT solution to the user at all times.\n\nResilience is, today, a key issue in NWP and we cannot but recognize this fact. Perhaps we have not emphasized enough the importance of this feature for future PNT systems, but policy makers must take all necessary actions to improve the resilience of existing PNT systems and services, perhaps by promoting the development of alternative independent PNT systems.\n\nWhat else should GPS World readers know about the Vision?\n\nRead the document. It’s not that long. And believe it was written from an independent and experienced point of view. We at NAVAC don’t claim to have the complete truth, but I think we have a pretty comprehensive view of the issue and that would be helpful to the reader.\n\nIn addition to the president, Luis Mayo, the other NAVAC members and contributors to the vision are Roger McKinlay, Bernd Eissfeller, Richard Peckham, Thomas Seiler, Leonardo Gagliardim and Olivier Colaïtis.\n\nSource: https://rntfnd.org/2024/08/08/pnt-vision-2035-a-must-read-gps-world/\n\nRed Sea incident: suspicious explosions near a ship off the coast of Yemen -Marine Traffic – August 13, 2024\n\nShip attack in the Red Sea, image credit: UKMTO\n\nThe UK Maritime Safety Agency’s UK Maritime Maritime Trades Operations (UKMTO) has reported incidents of attack in the Red Sea.\n\nOn August 12, the incident occurred 63 nautical miles southwest of Al Hudaydah, Yemen.

Both are in the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) but claimed by China.\n\nChinese academician Wu Shicun has proposed a controversial three-point plan to resolve the dispute. However, the proposal has raised concerns among regional players. Rather than defusing the situation, Wu’s strategy could further escalate tensions, complicating the already fraught geopolitical landscape.\n\nScarborough and the second Thomas Shoals\n\nTensions between the Philippines and China have escalated in the past two years, mainly over disputes over two important territories: the Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands.\n\nScarborough Shoal, a rock formation in the South China Sea, lies about 120 nautical miles (222 km) west of Luzon, the Philippines’ largest island, in the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In China, it is called “Huangyan Dao”, while in the Philippines it is known as “Panatag Shoal” or “Bajo de Masinloc”.\n\nThe Spratly Islands, a group of more than 100 islands and reefs, are partly claimed by the Philippines, but China asserts sovereignty over the entire archipelago. The islands are important for their rich fishing grounds and potential oil and gas reserves.\n\nSecond Thomas Bank is one of many disputed territories in the Spratly Islands. It falls within the 200 nautical mile (370km) EEZ of the Philippines, but is also claimed by China. It is known as “Ayungin Shoal” in the Philippines and “Renai Reef” in China.\n\nThe small rocky island is of both strategic and economic importance in the South China Sea. Over the past year and a half, the waters around the shoal have been a flashpoint for rising tensions between Beijing and Manila, with the area becoming a focal point of their ongoing territorial dispute.\n\nChinese aggression and escalating dispute\n\nThe dispute over the shoals is a complex issue involving not only the main contenders, but also other regional powers and the wider geopolitical landscape of the South China Sea. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, while the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam each claim different overlapping areas.\n\nThe standoff between the Philippines and China became increasingly volatile in 2012. China’s takeover of Scarborough Shoal prompted the Philippines to bring the issue before the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\nIn 2016, the court ruled that China’s claim to 90% of the South China Sea has no legal basis under international law. Despite this ruling, tensions persist. Both China and the Philippines frequently accuse each other of actions that harm the marine environment, exacerbating the ongoing dispute.\n\nBRP Sierra Madre standoff\n\nAt the center of the ongoing and increasingly tense maritime standoff is the BRP Sierra Madre, a Philippine navy ship from World War II.\n\nThe United States transferred this retired ship to the Philippine Navy in 1976, where it was used as a transport until the 1990s. It was deliberately grounded at Second Thomas Shoal 25 years ago (in 1999) to serve as a military outpost. It is currently manned by a small contingent of Filipino troops.\n\nIn the first week of July 2024, the Chinese government called for the immediate removal of BRP Sierra Madre, citing significant damage to the marine environment. Xiong Xiaofei, chief researcher at the South China Sea Ecology Center, emphasized that the removal of the vessel is crucial to prevent continued and cumulative damage to the Renai Reef coral ecosystem.\n\nThe report concluded that the ship’s grounding caused “fatal damage to the coral reef ecosystem”, which will not recover unless the Sierra Madre is removed. The rusting of the ship’s hull and the dumping of human waste by Philippine soldiers stationed on it have created “long-term hazards to healthy coral growth”.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, there have been repeated incidents related to Manila’s supply efforts for troops stationed on the ship. China has blocked Philippine supply missions to the outpost, leading to clashes between the two sides.\n\nBeijing said it had a “gentleman’s agreement” with former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, which focused on strengthening relations with China during his presidency.\n\nAccording to Beijing, this informal agreement allowed the Philippines to refit the ship “on humanitarian grounds”. The terms of the agreement required Manila to give advance notice of refueling missions, agree to Chinese on-site supervision, and exclude the transfer of construction materials.\n\nHowever, Duterte’s successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr (Bongbong Marcos), who took office in 2022, has denied the existence of any such agreement, and tensions between Beijing and Manila have escalated.\n\nThe most recent and most serious confrontation occurred on June 17, when, according to Manila, a Chinese coast guard vessel struck a Philippine supply ship, injuring eight Filipino sailors, including one who lost his thumb.\n\nThe United States transferred the retired ship to the Philippine Navy in 1976, where it was used as a transport until the 1990s.

At the center of his strategy is a proposal to blockade the BRP Sierra Madre, the World War II-era vessel that the Philippines ran aground to assert its territorial claims.\n\nWu describes the ongoing confrontations as a “bleeding wound” that must be addressed to prevent further escalation.\n\n“China’s belated efforts to restore calm on the Second Thomas Bank could encourage the Philippines to take more aggressive action,” Wu told Chinese publication Guancha.\n\nWu advocates for China to “diplomatically set a timetable for the Philippines to withdraw from the Second Thomas Bank,” specifying deadlines for the withdrawal of military personnel and arrangements for humanitarian aid during the transition. He argues that a clear timetable could end the prolonged “cat-and-mouse game” over the disputed reef.\n\nBlockade strategy: If the Philippines fails to meet this proposed timetable, Wu suggests China should take a more assertive approach. He proposes that Beijing should implement measures to “prevent and block the Philippines from engaging in provocative and status quo-changing activities,” such as cutting off sea and air supplies to the reef.\n\n“Humanitarian” evacuation: According to Wu, a prolonged blockade could create a “survival crisis” for Philippine troops stationed on the shoal. From a humanitarian perspective, China could establish a “special corridor” to allow for the recovery of Philippine personnel from the “temporary alert zone.”\n\nThis bold plan has sent ripples in diplomatic circles, raising alarm bells from Manila to Washington. It’s a bold move in China’s long-term strategy to control the South China Sea, a vital waterway through which trillions of dollars in trade pass annually.\n\nWill the plan resolve the dispute?\n\nAccording to The Geostrata, an Indian think tank, “the plan assumes that the withdrawal will lead to the end of the cat-and-mouse game” between Manila and Beijing. Shicun’s ideas reflect Beijing’s aggressive strategy to assert its dominance in the South China Sea. They also assume that there will be no response from other players in the region.\n\nThe critical question is whether Wu Shicun’s plan will resolve the territorial dispute or merely escalate tensions between China and the Philippines, potentially involving other regional players.\n\nThe answer, like the changing tides in the South China Sea, remains uncertain. What is clear is that this plan assumes a passive response from other regional actors – potentially a dangerous miscalculation in the complex web of Asian geopolitics.\n\nSource: https://www.eurasiantimes.com/chinas-three-point-strategy-to-annex-2nd/\n\nWhen Putin played ‘Russian roulette’ and lost a nuclear submarine and its 118 crew members in the Barents Sea – The EurAsian Times – August 13, 2024\n\nIn a remarkable confluence of historical and present conflicts, Ukraine’s recent assault on Russia’s Kursk region has rekindled memories of a World War II battle and a contemporary naval disaster.\n\nThe Kursk region, located just across the border from the Sumy area of northeastern Ukraine, has recently been in the spotlight with Ukraine’s bold incursion.\n\nInitially perceived as a routine raid akin to Ukrainian operations in May 2023 and March 2024, the latest offensive turned out to be a departure from previous tactics, marked by the involvement of experienced Ukrainian ground forces.\n\nThe assault surprised the Russian military. The new Ukrainian offensive quickly became a focal point because of its link with the historical background of the Kursk name.\n\nThe region evokes memories of the iconic Battle of Kursk, which took place almost 80 years ago during the Second World War. In 1943, Kursk witnessed one of the largest and most intense armored battles, in which Soviet forces finally triumphed over Nazi Germany.\n\nTo compound the historical significance, the name Kursk also carries the weight of one of the greatest naval tragedies.\n\nIn 1993, the Russian submarine K-141 was named in honor of the Battle of Kursk, commemorating the 50th anniversary of World War II. However, this tribute was overshadowed by tragedy.\n\nOn August 12, 2000, the Kursk sank during naval exercises in the Barents Sea following a catastrophic explosion that killed all 118 crew members. The disaster remains one of the darkest episodes of President Vladimir Putin’s tenure.\n\nPresident Putin in a controversial meeting with relatives of the dead sailors at Vidyaevo, during which the families complained about the Russian Navy’s response to the disaster\n\nKursk submarine: designed to target US aircraft carriers\n\nThe submarine Kursk was one of 11 Project 949A Antey (Oscar II) nuclear-powered Project 949A Antey (Oscar II) cruise missile submarines built at Sevmash in Severodvinsk and was among five assigned to the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet.\n\nThe development of this class of submarines was prompted by the Soviet Union’s deep concern during the Cold War about the threat posed by the United States aircraft carrier fleet.\n\nThe Soviets perceived American aircraft carriers as formidable threats capable of launching thermonuclear strikes against the Soviet Union and as potential submarine hunters of USSR nuclear ballistic missile submarines.\n\nIn response, the Soviet Union invested heavily in advanced weapons systems designed to counter and destroy American aircraft carriers.\n\nAntey-class submarines were a key part of this strategy. Known as “Oscar II” by NATO, these large nuclear-powered submarines were specifically designed to target and destroy major surface ships, particularly aircraft carriers.\n\nEach Oscar II measures 508 feet long by nearly 60 feet wide and displaces 19,400 tons – twice the displacement of a destroyer.\n\nTo compete with American nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, each Soviet submarine was equipped with two OK-650 nuclear reactors, providing a combined output of 97,990 horsepower. This power allowed them to reach speeds of up to 33 knots underwater.\n\nThe Oscar II’s substantial size was due to their ability to carry large missiles. Each submarine was armed with 24 P-700 Granite P-700 rockets, which were as large as a small airplane – 33 feet long and weighing 15,400 pounds.\n\nThese missiles could travel at speeds of Mach 1.6 and had a range of 388 miles. They utilized the now-obsolete Legenda satellite targeting system to accurately home in on aircraft carriers.\n\nEach Granit missile was capable of carrying either a 1,653-pound high-explosive conventional warhead, enough to cause significant damage, or a 500-kiloton warhead capable of destroying an aircraft carrier in a single shot. A total of 13 Oscar I and Oscar II submarines were built, including the K-141 Kursk.\n\nFaulty torpedo\n\nThe boat was operating in the northern Barents Sea, preparing for a major naval exercise – the first since the dissolution of the Soviet Union nine years earlier.\n\nThe exercise included four attack submarines, the Northern Fleet’s flagship battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy and numerous smaller vessels.\n\nOn August 12, 2000, at 11:28 a.m. local time, an underwater explosion rocked the area, followed by an even more powerful blast just two minutes later. Norwegian seismic monitoring stations detected both explosions. Stations in Canada and the United States also recorded the events, and the Norwegian service confirmed that they were explosions, not earthquakes.\n\nAccording to Russian reports, the 28,000-ton battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy felt a significant jolt from the initial explosion. The Kursk submarine, severely damaged by the explosions, sank in 354 feet of water at a steep 20-degree angle. The explosions blew a large hole in the submarine’s forward bow near the torpedo compartment.\n\nA Russian Navy investigation determined that the explosion was caused by one of the Kursk’s Type 65-76A super-gun torpedoes. This explosion was probably due to a defect in a weld that failed to contain the hydrogen peroxide fuel chamber.\n\nThe nuclear submarine Kursk, with just its conning tower, in a port near Murmansk, Russia, on October 23, 2001, weeks after it was salvaged and more than a year after it sank in the Barents Sea.\n\nReports also showed that the crew had not been properly trained to handle these torpedoes or their fuel. According to the US National Library of Medicine, although hydrogen peroxide itself is not flammable, it can ignite flammable materials and sustain combustion by releasing oxygen as it decomposes.\n\nIn one documented incident, 35% hydrogen peroxide that leaked onto a wooden pallet caused a severe fire, demonstrating the risks associated with hydrogen peroxide leaks.\n\nWhat happened to the crew\n\nThe sequence of events on the Kursk began with a leak of hydrogen peroxide that started a fire. This fire then triggered the detonation of the 900 kilogram explosive warhead of the 65-76A torpedo.\n\nThe explosion probably caused a major hull breach near the torpedo compartment. The subsequent larger explosion was probably the result of the detonation of the remaining torpedoes.\n\nDespite the sinking of the Kursk, not all 118 crew members died on the spot. At least 23 sailors managed to move to an aft compartment of the submarine where they waited for rescue. This was confirmed by Lieutenant Captain Dmitry Koselnikov, who left a note two hours after the second explosion, documenting that 23 men were still alive.\n\nMost of the details in the note were considered too personal or sensitive to be made public, but what was revealed provided a grim account of the crew’s final moments. The note confirmed that some sailors survived the initial explosions but were trapped inside the submarine for a long time.\n\nAfter the initial explosions, the surviving crew members, who were in the aft compartments, broke protocol and moved through the submarine to assemble in compartment nine, the furthest aft section where the only escape hatch was located.\n\nRealizing that their colleagues in the forward sections had been killed and that the hatch was not an escape option, the survivors prepared for the inevitable.\n\nIn his final note, Lieutenant Captain Kolesnikov described their attempts to use the escape hatch and their subsequent resignation to their fate. His luminous watch helped him record the exact times the note was written, which were between 13:34 and 15:15 on the day of the disaster.\n\nIt remains unclear why the men were unable to use their diving gear to escape through the hatch; some experts speculate that the explosions may have damaged the hatch. Unfortunately, despite their best efforts, all crew members eventually succumbed to the disaster.\n\nIndian Navy Captain Anurag Bisen, who was stationed in Russia at the time, told EurAsian Times, “One of the key safety features of submarines is that they are divided into compartments and can be isolated to contain a disaster. But only when the submarine is in shallow water can a successful rescue mission be carried out. The crew of the Russian submarine Kursk could have been rescued as there were many warships in the vicinity.”\n\nWas there any chance of saving the crew?\n\nDespite the fact that 23 sailors managed to make it to an aft compartment of the Kursk and await rescue, the Russian navy’s response was particularly slow, and the Kremlin initially rejected offers of Western assistance.\n\nInstead of accepting international help, Russia deployed mini-submarines that made several unsuccessful attempts to connect to the Kursk’s escape hatch.\n\nCapt. Bisen said valuable time was lost because of President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to accept help from the British Navy, which could carry out the rescue.\n\nPutin eventually agreed to international help, but by then it was too late for the trapped crew. At the time of the disaster, Putin was on vacation in Sochi and refused assistance from France, Germany, Italy, Norway, the US and the UK.\n\nKursk (K-141)\n\nInternational aid was only accepted five days after the explosions. Russia eventually asked Norwegian divers for help, who managed to open the hatch in just a few hours, but by then it was too late to save any of the crew.\n\nAll 23 sailors perished. The Russian Navy’s response was criticized as slow and ineffective, and the incident was downplayed by the Russian authorities.\n\nThe consequences of the rescue efforts were controversial. Evidence gathered after the recovery of the submarine showed that some of the sailors may have survived up to eight hours after the explosions.\n\nRumors and speculation surrounding the incident\n\nIn the years following the Kursk accident, the Russian media suggested that two US submarines and a British submarine were seen near the Russian naval exercise area at the time of the disaster.\n\nUS officials confirmed the presence of an American submarine nearby but denied any collision with the Kursk. NATO officials have also maintained this position with regard to US and UK vessels.\n\nThe Kursk sail was salvaged from a scrap yard and turned into a memorial at the Church of the Savior on the Waters in Murmansk.\n\nHowever, in November 2021, retired Russian Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, who was commander of the Northern Fleet during the Kursk disaster, made a controversial claim. He said the sinking of the Kursk was caused by a collision with a NATO submarine, contradicting the official conclusion that a faulty torpedo was to blame.\n\nIn an interview with the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Popov suggested that a NATO submarine may have inadvertently collided with the Kursk while pursuing it. He admitted that he could not identify the NATO submarine or provide any evidence to support his claim.\n\nAt the time of Popov’s interview, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the accusation, referring instead to the official investigation into the incident.\n\nPopov’s accusations may stem from his controversial role in the aftermath of the disaster, as he has been criticized for his slow and ineffective response after the explosions that occurred on August 12, 2000.\n\nSource: https://www.eurasiantimes.com/a-russian-navy-nuclear-submarine/\n\nIndian Navy’s Project 75I – German TKMS leads Spanish navy after field trials for AIP-submarine deal – The EurAsian Times – August 13, 2024\n\nGerman submarine builder ThyssenKrupp (tKMS) and its Indian partner Mazagaon Dockyard Limited (MDL) partner Mazagaon Dockyard Limited (MDL) have topped the Indian Navy’s field trials for Project-75I for the construction of six submarines with Fuel Cell Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology combined with lithium-ion battery.\n\nBetween March and June, the Indian Navy evaluated submarines offered by tKMS in Germany and Spanish shipbuilder Navantia in Cartagena. Only one of these companies proved and validated the AIP technology.\n\nNavantia has not yet incorporated the technology into the S80 submarine offered to the Indian Navy. One of the class submarines has already been inducted into the Spanish Navy without AIP technology.\n\nThe German Navy in March 2024 supplied its submarine for field evaluation to the Indian Navy. The Indian Navy team participated in a one-day dive test in the German 212-class submarine to evaluate the AIP technology. However, Navantia’s field evaluations took place in a simulator.\n\nNavantia said that its submarine design meets “almost” all technical requirements of the P-75I without any redesign.\n\nReports indicate that the Indian Navy has told the MDL that it has cleared the crucial field evaluations and has an edge in the bidding process. The Navy’s Indian partners, Larsen and Toubro, have also been informed about the deviations in the process in Cartagena.\n\nThe Fuel Cell Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology combined with a lithium-ion battery gives the submarines the ability to loiter in the deep ocean for longer duration and, when necessary, move towards their target at high speeds without giving up their position.\n\nEurAsian Times has learned that efficient on-board power systems were also one of the Indian Navy’s requirements.\n\nThe results are on expected lines as Navantia has so far only completed factory testing of its AIP technology for its S-80 program. During the tests, the Indian Navy evaluated the performance of the Navantia system in a simulated environment that replicated the conditions that the system would encounter during actual submarine missions.\n\nFacilities at the Cartagena shipyard enabled this environment, with capabilities to simulate submarine operations and test entire sections of the submarine.\n\nThe German shipbuilder offered its Class 214 submarines. These combine the advanced technological aspects of the 212 CD submarines with the latest developments in AIP technology. The 212 CD class submarines are being built exclusively for the Norwegian Navy and are tailored to their operational requirements in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe 214 offered to India will be adapted to the requirements of the Indian Navy. It will be a derivative of the 214 class of submarines with the latest improvements in AIP technology. It will be equipped with a lithium-ion battery, have an advanced sensor and combat system and will not compromise on stealth features.\n\nWhen EurAsian Times visited the tKMS construction site in Kiel, Germany, and interviewed Dr. Christian Frühling, tKMS program manager for Project-75I, he expressed confidence in the technology.\n\n“In this respect, our big advantage is our unique AIP solution. The design of the submarine is a derivative of the HDW Class 214 submarine, which is currently in service with several navies worldwide. It will be tailored to the requirements of the Indian Navy and incorporate technological advancements. To sum up our Project-75I design: it is proven, it is advanced and it is for India,” Dr. Frühling told EurAsian Times during an exclusive interview.\n\nThe confidence of tkMS came from the fact that so far it is the only company with fuel cell-based AIP systems. The 214-class submarine is currently operated by Greece, Portugal, Turkey and South Korea.\n\nSubmarines: Courtesy: tKMS\n\nNon-nuclear AIP submarines\n\nThe combination of a fuel cell-based AIP system and a lithium-ion battery will bring a game-changing capability to the Indian Navy, which has a long area of responsibility stretching from the Gulf of Aden in the west to the Straits of Malacca in the east. In the face of growing Chinese maritime capability, the Indian Navy needs a credible submarine force.\n\nEuropean countries have not used lithium-ion batteries, but Japan has. And tkMS will integrate the two technologies for the Indian Navy if it gets the contract.\n\nAIP submarines have increased mobility. They can “bow” or sit on the ocean floor with only critical systems working to conserve power and extend operational time while using passive sonar to detect targets. Because the fuel cells operate at higher efficiency at lower loads, the foundation could extend the endurance of a given mission.\n\nCompared to the 24 conventional submarines required, India’s submarine fleet has only 16 submarines, and apart from the six recently built submarines, the rest are over 30 years old and nearing their decommissioning date. The project is therefore expected to be a high priority project for the Indian Navy.\n\nIf MDL is awarded the Project-75I contract, the submarines will be built in India from the first boat. tkMS will provide the design and critical elements. MDL will be the bidding company for the project, with tkMS as the foreign collaborator.

Now, even with the launched military-industrial complex, Russia cannot cope, especially when new, completely unexpected directions of the front open up.\n\nBut it is important to emphasize that if in 2022 Belarus transferred ammunition and equipment from warehouses, now we are talking about the transfer from combat units. This may indicate that the Belarusian depots and arsenals were emptied in 2022, and now Lukashenko can only respond to Moscow’s request with equipment from existing units.\n\nSwedish: https://www.blackseanews.net/read/220787\n\nA mine has been discovered again off Romania’s Black Sea coast – Black Sea News – August 13, 2024\n\nIn the area of the Romanian nature reserve Grindul-Chituc on Tuesday, August 13, a suspicious object was discovered, probably drifting from the Black Sea.\n\nSource: Romanian Ministry of National Defense, according to European Pravda\n\nThe agency said it had received a report on Tuesday morning from local authorities about an unidentified object that washed ashore near Grindul Cituți in southeastern Romania.\n\n“Examining the photos taken at the scene, the object is most likely a YaRM-type anti-land mine,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThey added that the mine site has been fenced off and Romanian Navy deminers will neutralize the object in the near future.\n\nThe Grindul-Cituc territory is part of the Danube Delta, which Romania shares with Ukraine.\n\nSince the large-scale invasion began, Romania has discovered and destroyed more than 100 floating mines.\n\nRomania, along with Turkey and Bulgaria, launched joint mine action operations in the Black Sea last month.\n\nSource: https://www.blackseanews.net/read/220784\n\nBlack Sea submarine cable project approved by international experts – Black Sea News – August 13, 2024\n\nThe Ministry of Economy of Georgia reports that an international study has recognized the Black Sea Energy Submarine Submarine Cable (“Black Sea Energy Submarine Cable, BSSC”) project as promising.\n\nExperts have also prepared a feasibility study for the project, reports bizzone.info.\n\nThe study was carried out by the Italian consulting company CESI at the request of the state-owned Georgian State Electrosystem.
