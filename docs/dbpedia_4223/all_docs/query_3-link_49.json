        "text": "The United States is on an unsustainable fiscal path that will likely require government action to avoid a crisis. We believe investors should keep an eye on this long-term issue and consider steps they might take to protect themselves.\n\nEvidence of potential fiscal troubles has long been accumulating. Then, on August 1, the rating agency Fitch issued a wake-up call: It downgraded U.S. debt from AAA to AA+.\n\nAs significant as that downgrade was, the markets seemed indifferent to it.1 Their nonreaction was likely due to the fact that the deficit problem is too far into the future to price its tail risk efficiently. Also, previous doomsday predictions have been revised, leading many to treat such forecasts like the boy who cried wolf.\n\nWe believe the United States will not suffer a fiscal crisis. Still, taxpayers should beware: One of the key ways the government is likely to avoid this fate will be by raising taxes to increase revenues. Therefore, investors may want to consider making tax-efficient investing a priority in the coming decade.\n\nWhile history has rarely seen a sovereign crisis in a developed country that issues its own currency, “rare” does not mean impossible. Last fall, the United Kingdom had what we view as a mini-debt crisis that led to unprecedented volatility for the currency of a G7 country: The pound depreciated by 10% in a few weeks. And in the 1920s, post–World War I France faced a full-fledged fiscal disaster, with the country’s solution forcing the French franc to depreciate by about 80% relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe lesson from both these countries’ crises is this: Ultimately, the currency shoulders the burden of a fiscal crisis. We therefore suggest investors also consider adding real assets to their portfolios to hedge this long-term risk—just in case.\n\nHow do we reach these conclusions? Here’s our thinking.\n\nCBO’s dire news re: the U.S.’s fiscal future\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) startled many in June when it declared that U.S. government debt held by the public was on track to rise to its highest level ever: 116% of GDP in 2030.\n\nSuch a high would surpass the nation’s previous peak of 106% in 1946 following World War II.2 It is also greater than the CBO previously had envisioned, stemming from the pandemic and its associated fiscal spending.\n\nIn principle, this shift to a higher debt level will have a cost associated to it. Indeed, the U.S. economy has already paid some of this cost in the form of higher inflation.3\n\nWhere is the U.S. government debt-to-GDP ratio headed?\n\nThe chart describes the U.S. government debt to GDP ratio from 1940 to 2022. In addition, the dotted lines near the end of the chart show the 10-year U.S. government debt to GDP ratio projection from 2019 and from 2023. For the historical data line, the first data point came in at 43.6 in 1940. Shortly after, it shot up to peak at 106.1 in 1946. It then went down all the way and troughed at 23.2 in 1974. Then it went on an upward ramp until it plateaued at 47.9 in 1993. Then it went back down to another low at 31.5 in 2001. Then it went up all the way and peaked at 98.4 in 2021. The line ended at 96.9 in 2022, a bit lower than the previous year. For the 2019 CBO projection, The first data point came in at 78.9 in 2019 and the last data point came in at 95.1 in 2029. For the 2023 CBO projection, The first data point came in at 98.2 and the last data point came in at 118.9 in 2033.\n\nIt’s thought that the uncontrollable rise in the budget deficit will likely be the main culprit responsible for pushing government debt to new all-time highs. By the mid-2030s, all federal revenues will be required to fund mandatory government spending alone (i.e., to fund entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, interest on debt plus other mandatory programs such as unemployment insurance and veterans’ benefits).4\n\nAt that point, there would be zero funds for such basic functions as defense, roadwork, the judiciary and so on—unless the federal government borrowed and went into even deeper debt. Such a spiral, if unchecked, would be dire. The CBO foresees that by the early 2050s, the overall U.S. fiscal deficit, if unaddressed, will grow to 10% of GDP.5\n\nThe U.S. is on track for a fiscal reckoning (according to the CBO)\n\nThe chart describes the mandatory spending (inclusive of social security, Medicare/Medicaid, net interest, other mandatory) as a % of GDP as well as total revenue as a % of GDP. Both lines are shown with 2023 CBO projection at the end as dotted lines. The data goes from 1962 all the way to 2050 (projection). For the mandatory spending as % of GDP line, it started at 5.9 in 1962. It was on the rise until it peaked at 23.4 in 2020. It then declined to 16.9 in 2023. For the 2023 CBO projection of this data, it’s expected to come down to 16 in 2025. Then it’s expected to rise to 21.5 in 2050. For the total revenue as % of GDP line, it started at 17 in 1962. It then stayed relatively flat and ticked up to 20 in 2000. Then it went down to 14.6 in 2009. Then it went slightly up to 19.6 in 2022. For the 2023 CBO projection of this data, it’s expected to flatten to 17.4 in 2025. Then it’s expected to stay flat till the last data point which came in at 18.9 in 2050. There is a circle for the point that the two lines are expected to cross in 2034 at 18.1. Also, an arrow pointing to it with a textbox saying 2034.\n\nThis projection is ominous and should be taken seriously. However, we are skeptical about its exactitude, given that prior CBO projections have proven overly pessimistic. For example, in 2009, the CBO thought healthcare spending would surge; instead, it flatlined.\n\nIndeed, in 2009,6 the CBO stated that 2024 was the year when mandatory government spending would outstrip total U.S. revenues.7 But then improvements in healthcare spending (on Medicare and Medicaid) led the CBO to push back this deadline by a full decade—to 2034.\n\nAlready, expected government spending on healthcare has declined dramatically\n\nThe chart describes the Medicare and Medicaid spending as a % of GDP as in historical data, the 2009 CBO projection and the 2023 CBO projection. The historical data line started at 0.02 in 1962. It went all the way up and peaked eat 6.18 in 2020. Then it came down slightly and the last data point came in at 5.77 in 2022. For the 2009 CBO projection dotted line, the first data point came in at 6.8 in 2023. Then it went all the way up to 12.2 in 2050. For the 2023 CBO projection dotted line, the first data point came in at 5.1 in 2023. It came down slightly to 4.8 in 2025. Then it went all the way up to 7 in 2050.\n\nThe CBO said its dramatically revised projections for healthcare spending8 were due not principally to legislative reforms, but rather as a result of other developments, both positive and negative.\n\nThe positive developments included the following: Generic drugs have slowed drug price inflation; care practitioners have improved some disease management; cost-saving technologies were implemented, particularly to treat cardiovascular diseases. Together, such factors helped healthcare inflation to fall below overall U.S. inflation in the 2010s.\n\nGood news: Healthcare inflation is lower than overall U.S. inflation\n\nThe chart describes the five-year moving average of the year-over-year percent change of GDP price inflation and health services price inflation. For the GDP price inflation line, the first data point came in at 6.4 in 1984. It then came down to 1.6 in 1999. Shortly after, it went up to 2.7 in 2007. Then it went back down again to 1.5 in 2013. It then stayed flat for a bit until it spiked to the last data point at 3.4 in 2022. For the health services price inflation line, the first data point came in at 10.4 in 1984. It went down to 6.7 at first in 1988. Then it bounced up to 8.0 in 1992. Then it went all the way down to 2.3 in 2000. Then it came back up to 3.5 in 2007. Then it went lowered to bottom at 1.1 in 2017. Then it ticked up a little and reached the last data point at 2.1 in 2021.\n\nHowever, a negative development also has decreased government spending on healthcare relative to the prior projections (i.e., Americans’ increased rate of morbidity).\n\nLife expectancy took a huge hit during the pandemic, resetting back to late 1990s levels. Yet even before the pandemic, U.S. life expectancy was deteriorating relative to all other advanced economies,9 which means less expense pressure on Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nFewer Americans are expected to make it to old age (i.e., 70 years old)\n\nThe chart describes the life expectancy at birth in years from 1980 to 2021 for United States and comparable countries (other developed nations). It includes ( Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada (except 2021), France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The United States line started at 73.7 in 1980. It went all the way up to 78.7 in 2010. Then it stayed flat until it hit 78.8 in 2019. Then it came down dramatically and finished lower at 76.1 in 2021. The comparable country average line started at 74.5 in 1980. Then it went all the way up and peaked at 82.6 in 2019. It came down slightly to 82 in 2020. But then it quickly went back up to 82.4 in 2021. For the other countries: Australia went from 74.6 in 1980 to 83.4 in 2021. Austria went from 72.7 in 1980 to 81.3 in 2021. Belgium went from 73.3 in 1980 to 81.9 in 2021. Canada went from 75.1 in 1980 to 81.7 in 2020. France went from 74.3 in 1980 to 82.5 in 2021. Germany went from 72.9 in 1980 to 80.9 in 2021. Japan went from 76.1 in 1980 to 84.5 in 2021. The Netherlands went from 75.9 in 1980 to 81.5 in 2021. Sweden went from 75.8 in 1980 to 83.2 in 2021. Switzerland went from 75.7 in 1980 to 84 in 2021. The United Kingdom went from 73.2 in 1980 to 80.8 in 2021.\n\nWhat would U.S. debt crisis look like?\n\nOne might argue that the United States already experiences a debt crisis of sorts: Congress’s annual showdowns over lifting the debt ceiling and adopting a budget have repeatedly damaged confidence that lawmakers can resolve fiscal issues—all of which played a role in Fitch’s decision to make the downgrade.\n\nHowever, a true debt crisis for a country like the United States would mean:\n\nTax revenue could no longer finance the fiscal deficit, or at least keep it from spiraling higher\n\nInvestor demand for Treasury securities would deteriorate dramatically\n\nThe Treasury would be forced to ask the central bank to finance the deficit directly, in a way that supersedes the central bank’s inflation objectives\n\nThis scenario is not playing out now—nor is it likely in the future—for a number of reasons.\n\nFor one: The debt-carrying capacity can be mind-bogglingly high for countries such as the United States that issue nearly all sovereign debt in domestic currency, in this case the USD, which is also a global reserve currency.10 For example, a debt crisis still hasn’t arisen in Japan (which issues its debt essentially entirely in yen)—even though that country’s sovereign debt-GDP ratio is currently at 228%, more than twice of the United States.11\n\nIndeed, the United States and Japan can never technically default, as they can always print domestic currency to pay their debts. Little wonder then that the capital markets allow them to sustain higher equilibrium levels of debt12 than countries such as Argentina and Turkey, which each have issued more than 60% of their government debts in a foreign currency.\n\nCountries that issue foreign FX debt cannot sustain high debt loads\n\nThe chart describes the foreign currency government debt share versus government debt-GDP ratio. Foreign currency debt as of total debt Debt to GDP ratio Argentina 0.672337971 0.84466 Turkey 0.653119873 0.336 Chile 0.38186679 0.361 Colombia 0.361122414 0.63626 Hungary 0.258854999 0.63 Poland 0.231633613 0.446 Indonesia 0.203557569 0.39934 Mexico 0.175482567 0.56029 Israel 0.155103055 0.615 Russia 0.138031978 0.19597 South Africa 0.093623614 0.71016 Brazil 0.048706792 0.85906 France 0.024403983 1.053 India 0.022682911 0.83126 Korea 0.019400142 0.446 Canada 0.018563199 0.886 China 0.01521489 0.77097 Czech Republic 0.01349768 0.398 Germany 0.01 0.619 United States 0.004166612 1.031 Italy 0.001151174 1.373 United Kingdom 0 0.937 Japan 0 2.28\n\nStill, the United States could quasi-default. The government could be forced to borrow money from the central bank to fund public spending, causing a dramatic depreciation of the dollar and/or spiraling inflation.\n\nInstead, today’s Federal Reserve has been doing the exact opposite to counter the country’s recent high inflation. The Fed has been reducing the size of its balance sheet.\n\nIt is historically very rare for a government to borrow money from its central bank to finance public spending (debt monetization). But it can—and has happened. The last time it occurred for a member of today’s G7 nations was 100 years ago: in France during the 1920s.13\n\nWWI left France with high legacy debts and little domestic capacity to raise tax revenues. When Germany refused to pay war reparations, France borrowed directly from its central bank to finance its post-war reconstruction.\n\nFrench inflation soared, and the value of the French franc plummeted (by close to 80% versus the USD). France decided to monetize its debt (rather than endure fiscal austerity). The fallout wasn’t pretty; fixed income investors suffered mightily.\n\nYet historians today are still debating how negative France’s choice ultimately was to the country’s real economy.14\n\nFrance paid a steep nominal price for monetizing its way out of high WWI debts\n\nThe chart describes the number of U.S. dollars bought by 1 French Franc versus French debt as a % of GDP from 1910 to 1930. For the number of U.S. dollars bought by 1 French Franc line, the first data point came in at 0.17 in 1916. Then it went up and peaked at 0.18 in 1919. Shortly after, it fell all the way and went flat until the last data point at 0.04 in 1930. For the French debt as a percent of GDP columns, the first data point came in at 80% in 1910. It slightly declined until it reached 66% in 1913. Then it went up to 170% in 1920. It then went up further and peaked at 237% in 1921. After peak, it went all the way down and the last data point came in at 144% in 1930.\n\nMore recently, we believe the United Kingdom experienced a mini debt crisis during just one month in 2022: The pound sterling fell by about 10% against the dollar—an extreme move for a G7 currency.15\n\nHowever, this currency depreciation was a response to proposed tax cuts and increased spending, at a time of minimal fiscal space in the United Kingdom. The moves in Gilt yields and the currency reversed when the plans were abandoned.\n\nFrance’s and the United Kingdom’s experiences illustrate that when fiscal pressures intensify, the currency can serve as the relief valve.\n\nTough battles ahead over taxes and spending\n\nThe U.S. democratic process will decide what budgetary changes will be made to improve the nation’s fiscal sustainability. We make no recommendations and have no preferences. We can, though, observe facts that will underlie discussions about how to stave off a potential quasi-default.\n\nFirst, it is unlikely the problem will be solved by potential savings from increased means-testing for entitlement programs. For example, according to a CBO study in December 2022, means-testing that reduces benefits only for top-quintile earners would reduce Social Security outlays by a total of $40 billion by 2032.16 However, $40 billion is miniscule compared to total Social Security expenditures of $2.27 trillion by 2032, in the CBO baseline projection. And there is a firm bipartisan consensus against more sizable cuts to these programs.17\n\nAlso: It’s not obvious that the U.S. government has a spending problem in its other mandatory categories (unemployment compensation, the nutrition assistance programs, veterans’ benefits, etc.). This component of spending surged during the pandemic. However, it is expected to drop back to its historical average (relative to GDP) over the next decade.\n\n“Other mandatory” government spending spiked during the pandemic—but has since dropped\n\nThe chart describes other mandatory government spending as a % of GDP (the dotted line extension is the 2023 CBO projection for that data). The first data point came in at 2.34% in 1962. It then went up to 4.26% in 1975. It then came down to trough at 1.95% in 1997. Then it spiked to 5.06% in 2009. Then it came down to 2.43% in 2014. It stayed flat for a bit longer until it skyrocketed to peak at 10.63% in 2021. The last data point came in at 5.92% in 2022. The 2023 CBO projection dotted line started at 4.2% in 2023. It’s expected to quickly come down to 2.8% in 2028. Then it’s expected to continue to decline at a moderate pace until the last data point at 2.2% in 2050.\n\nWhich brings us to taxes. U.S. tax revenue is low relative to the United States’ own history, and it is especially low relative to the tax share of GDP in other wealthy countries. This could mean that in the next 10 years, lawmakers will try to raise tax revenues. How specifically? For a range of possibilities, we refer readers to the (non-partisan) Tax Policy Center’s briefing.18\n\nU.S. tax revenue is currently lower than it was in the 1980s\n\nThe chart describes the U.S. Federal tax revenue as a % of GDP (20-year average). The data is described using two stacked bars. The two bars describe the compositions of the U.S. Federal tax revenue in 1985 and 2022 respectively. All data points are as a % of GDP. 1985 2022 Individual Income Taxes 7.7% 7.6% Social Security Taxes 4.8% 5.8% Corporate Income Taxes 2.5% 1.6% Excise Taxes 1.1% 0.5% Miscellaneous Receipts 0.3% 0.5% Estate/Gift Taxes 0.3% 0.1% Customs Duties 0.2% 0.2% Sum: 17.0% 16.2%\n\nU.S. tax revenue also is low when compared to other developed nations\n\nThe chart describes the total government revenue as a % of GDP (2022, 20-year average). The total government revenue as a % of GDP (2022, 20-year average) bar chart includes 8 bars/countries (Norway, Sweden, Eurozone, Canada, UK, Switzerland, Japan, U.S.) Norway 56% Sweden 51% Eurozone 46% Canada 40% UK 38% Switzerland 36% Japan 33% US 28%\n\nInvestors: Watch debt payments versus growth\n\nWhat should investors be looking for, and how might they consider hedging the long-term risk of possibly deteriorating U.S. fiscal dynamics?\n\nKeep an eye on R-G: The sovereign debt-to-GDP ratio cannot spiral as long as the interest rate on newly issued debt (R) is below the economy’s structural growth rate (G).19 Generally speaking, R has been below G for at least the last 20 years.20\n\nHowever, the CBO is assuming that over the long run, G will fall below R on a sustained basis—sending interest costs spiraling. The agency’s long-term projections show interest costs rising to 6% of GDP by 2050 (double the 3% highs recorded in the 1990s).\n\nIn terms of the short term, we believe the rise in interest costs over the last year should be seen as a one-time reset to a higher level (relative to GDP) because of a shift in Treasury bill issuance.21 After this reset is complete, the rise in interest costs should become more gradual (especially if, as markets currently expect, the Fed ends up cutting its policy rate in 2024).\n\nTo be sure (and pivoting back to the long-term discussion), over the past year, the market-traded real 10-year interest rate has picked up meaningfully, to about 2%. This is getting close to consensus estimates for longer-term economic growth in the United States.\n\nReal interest rates have been below growth for at least 20 years\n\nThe chart describes 10-year real yield, 10-year rolling real GDP growth (year/year % change), and consensus estimates of trend real GDP growth (year/year % change). For the 10-year real yield line, it started at 2.1% in Q1 2003. It first trended lower to 1.7% in Q2 2005. Then shortly after it went up to get to 2.5% in Q2 2006. Then it stayed flat for a bit and went back down to 1.3% in Q1 2008. Then it quickly bounced back again to 2.6% in Q4 2008. Then it fell all the way to trough at -0.8% in Q4 2012. Then it came back up to 1.1% in Q4 2018. Shortly after it came back down to -1.0% in Q3 2021. Then it rose again to 1.5% in Q4 2022. Then it went a bit lower to 1.4% in Q2 2023. The last data point came in higher at 1.9% in Q3 2023. For the 10-year rolling real GDP growth line. The first data point came in at 3.3% in Q1 2000. It went up at first to hit the peak at 3.6% in Q1 2001. It then came all the way down to bottom at 1.4% in Q1 2016. Then it rose again to 2.3% in Q3 2019. Then it came down again to 1.1% in Q2 2020. It then came back up to 2.2% in Q4 2021. Then it went flat, and the last data point came in at 2.2% in Q2 2023. For the consensus estimates of trend real GDP growth line. The first data point came in at 2% in 2025. Then it ended lower at 1.8% in 2029.\n\nBut no one knows exactly what is now causing today’s longer-term real interest rates to rise.\n\nAccording to J.P. Morgan Corporate Investment Bank Research, one catalyst could be a pickup in expected productivity growth as corporations adopt new artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.22 This gets at a crucial insight: An economy’s fiscal sustainability is intimately tied to its long-run rate of productivity growth. If productivity growth picks up in the coming years due to AI (and especially if AI technology contributes to a further bending of the cost curve in the healthcare sector), then the CBO’s baseline outlook could become more favorable to debt sustainability.\n\nAlternatively, this year’s rise in real interest rates could signal more intense tradeoffs are coming. Budget and policy analysts are highly uncertain about the cost of the Inflation Reduction Act (the historic climate related legislation passed in 2022). It could be more than double what the CBO currently assumes.23 If so, prospects for U.S. fiscal sustainability may actually be more dire.\n\nHow to hedge the long-term risk?\n\nConsider tax-efficiency and real assets as hedges against a potentially dicey fiscal outlook over the next decade.\n\nBecause the federal government is likely to try to raise the tax share of GDP, investors may want to pay a lot of attention to tax efficiency and should consider tax-loss harvesting strategies. Also, as we noted in a previous article, separately managed accounts (SMAs) can offer advantages over exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to their flexibility in terms of potential tax savings, benefits when it comes to tax-aware transitions and tax-efficient gifting.\n\nAnd in case all else fails (U.S. economic growth fails to pull us out of the hole, political gridlock prevents necessary changes to taxes and government spending, recently passed legislation ends up being more costly than assumed), then it’s not too far-fetched that the United States might experience an event that is qualitatively similar to France’s in the 1920s.\n\nHence, we also recommend that investors who like to be very prepared consider adding real assets to their portfolios, given the historically tight inverse relationship between the U.S. dollar and a diversified portfolio of real assets.\n\nReal assets do well when the USD depreciates\n\nThe chart describes USD (BBDXY Index) versus Real Assets (SPRAUT Index) in a scatterplot from 2005 to present. The scatterplot describes USD (x-axis) versus real assets (y-axis) as in monthly % change from 2005 to present. (there is also a text box in the chart saying “R=0.75”, which is the level of correlation) Date Real Assets USD 07/31/2023 2.8% -1.2% 06/30/2023 2.8% -1.1% 05/31/2023 -4.2% 1.6% 04/28/2023 1.3% -0.3% 03/31/2023 0.9% -2.0% 02/28/2023 -4.1% 2.6% 01/31/2023 5.4% -1.9% 12/30/2022 -1.7% -1.8% 11/30/2022 6.0% -4.8% 10/31/2022 2.9% -0.2% 09/30/2022 -8.7% 3.2% 08/31/2022 -3.3% 2.2% 07/29/2022 4.6% 0.6% 06/30/2022 -7.3% 2.7% 05/31/2022 0.2% -1.5% 04/29/2022 -3.6% 4.5% 03/31/2022 3.2% 1.0% 02/28/2022 0.1% -0.2% 01/31/2022 -1.6% 0.8% 12/31/2021 4.3% -0.8% 11/30/2021 -2.4% 1.9% 10/29/2021 3.0% -0.4% 09/30/2021 -2.1% 1.6% 08/31/2021 0.1% 0.5% 07/30/2021 1.8% -0.1% 06/30/2021 0.3% 2.3% 05/31/2021 1.9% -1.5% 04/30/2021 4.5% -1.7% 03/31/2021 1.5% 1.5% 02/26/2021 2.0% 0.5% 01/29/2021 -0.1% 0.9% 12/31/2020 2.9% -2.2% 11/30/2020 8.5% -2.4% 10/30/2020 -1.2% -0.4% 09/30/2020 -2.5% 1.4% 08/31/2020 1.5% -1.5% 07/31/2020 4.0% -3.3% 06/30/2020 1.7% -0.7% 05/29/2020 3.5% -1.2% 04/30/2020 6.6% -0.4% 03/31/2020 #N/A #N/A 02/28/2020 -4.9% 1.1% 01/31/2020 -0.6% 0.9% 12/31/2019 2.7% -2.0% 11/29/2019 -0.7% 1.1% 10/31/2019 1.1% -1.9% 09/30/2019 0.9% 0.2% 08/30/2019 0.5% 0.6% 07/31/2019 -0.2% 1.9% 06/28/2019 3.4% -1.6% 05/31/2019 -1.2% 0.6% 04/30/2019 0.1% 0.1% 03/29/2019 2.0% 0.7% 02/28/2019 0.9% 0.8% 01/31/2019 6.6% -1.3% 12/31/2018 -2.8% -1.0% 11/30/2018 0.3% -0.2% 10/31/2018 -3.0% 2.3% 09/28/2018 -0.5% 0.1% 08/31/2018 -0.3% 0.7% 07/31/2018 0.7% -0.6% 06/29/2018 0.3% 0.9% 05/31/2018 0.3% 2.1% 04/30/2018 1.1% 2.0% 03/30/2018 0.7% -1.0% 02/28/2018 -4.1% 1.4% 01/31/2018 1.2% -3.4% 12/29/2017 1.4% -0.4% 11/30/2017 1.2% -1.5% 10/31/2017 0.3% 1.8% 09/29/2017 0.1% 0.7% 08/31/2017 0.6% 0.0% 07/31/2017 2.6% -2.6% 06/30/2017 0.1% -1.2% 05/31/2017 0.9% -1.5% 04/28/2017 0.9% -0.5% 03/31/2017 -0.1% -1.3% 02/28/2017 1.3% 0.4% 01/31/2017 1.4% -2.6% 12/30/2016 2.1% 0.9% 11/30/2016 -1.7% 3.9% 10/31/2016 -2.6% 2.2% 09/30/2016 0.8% -0.4% 08/31/2016 -0.8% 0.6% 07/29/2016 1.7% -0.4% 06/30/2016 3.1% -1.4% 05/31/2016 -0.5% 3.7% 04/29/2016 3.3% -1.9% 03/31/2016 7.0% -3.9% 02/29/2016 1.0% -1.8% 01/29/2016 -2.7% 1.6% 12/31/2015 -2.0% -0.4% 11/30/2015 -3.0% 2.3% 10/30/2015 3.7% -0.3% 09/30/2015 -2.1% 0.6% 08/31/2015 -3.4% -0.1% 07/31/2015 -1.1% 2.3% 06/30/2015 -2.4% -0.9% 05/29/2015 -1.4% 2.3% 04/30/2015 2.0% -3.0% 03/31/2015 -1.7% 2.4% 02/27/2015 0.7% 0.4% 01/30/2015 0.5% 3.3% 12/31/2014 -1.6% 2.2% 11/28/2014 -0.3% 2.4% 10/31/2014 1.6% 0.9% 09/30/2014 -4.2% 4.0% 08/29/2014 1.7% 0.7% 07/31/2014 -1.3% 1.9% 06/30/2014 1.9% -0.7% 05/30/2014 1.5% 0.3% 04/30/2014 2.2% -0.8% 03/31/2014 0.6% -0.1% 02/28/2014 3.5% -1.4% 01/31/2014 -0.2% 1.2% 12/31/2013 0.9% -0.1% 11/29/2013 -1.3% 0.9% 10/31/2013 2.3% 0.0% 09/30/2013 2.9% -2.2% 08/30/2013 -1.6% 0.8% 07/31/2013 2.0% -1.4% 06/28/2013 -2.8% 0.3% 05/31/2013 -3.6% 2.7% 04/30/2013 2.7% -1.0% 03/29/2013 1.3% 0.5% 02/28/2013 -0.5% 2.8% 01/31/2013 2.2% 0.2% 12/31/2012 1.3% 0.1% 11/30/2012 0.3% 0.2% 10/31/2012 0.5% 0.3% 09/28/2012 1.7% -1.4% 08/31/2012 1.1% -1.1% 07/31/2012 2.9% 0.3% 06/29/2012 3.1% -1.9% 05/31/2012 -4.9% 5.0% 04/30/2012 1.2% -0.5% 03/30/2012 -0.5% 0.5% 02/29/2012 2.4% -0.1% 01/31/2012 4.0% -1.9% 12/30/2011 0.7% 1.7% 11/30/2011 -2.2% 2.1% 10/31/2011 6.5% -3.0% 09/30/2011 -6.9% 6.6% 08/31/2011 -1.9% 1.0% 07/29/2011 1.2% -1.3% 06/30/2011 -1.5% -0.3% 05/31/2011 -0.8% 1.7% 04/29/2011 3.7% -3.6% 03/31/2011 0.5% -0.9% 02/28/2011 2.7% -1.1% 01/31/2011 1.5% -0.8% 12/31/2010 4.5% -2.8% 11/30/2010 -2.6% 3.9% 10/29/2010 3.5% -1.9% 09/30/2010 5.3% -4.4% 08/31/2010 0.5% 1.6% 07/30/2010 7.0% -4.2% 06/30/2010 0.1% -0.9% 05/31/2010 -6.4% 5.1% 04/30/2010 1.4% 0.4% 03/31/2010 3.2% 0.2% 02/26/2010 1.3% 0.6% 01/29/2010 -2.9% 1.2% 12/31/2009 1.4% 3.4% 11/30/2009 4.0% -2.1% 10/30/2009 0.2% -0.6% 09/30/2009 4.0% -1.8% 08/31/2009 3.2% 0.1% 07/31/2009 6.3% -2.3% 06/30/2009 0.2% 1.2% 05/29/2009 8.6% -6.0% 04/30/2009 7.1% -1.5% 03/31/2009 3.7% -2.9% 02/27/2009 -5.3% 3.2% 01/30/2009 -3.9% 5.0% 12/31/2008 4.5% -4.9% 11/28/2008 -6.4% 1.6% 10/31/2008 -16.9% 8.2% 09/30/2008 -8.2% 2.8% 08/29/2008 -2.3% 5.0% 07/31/2008 -2.2% 0.6% 06/30/2008 -2.9% -0.1% 05/30/2008 0.8% 0.2% 04/30/2008 2.5% 0.8% 03/31/2008 -0.8% -1.6% 02/29/2008 2.3% -1.8% 01/31/2008 -1.5% -1.7% 12/31/2007 -0.5% 0.5% 11/30/2007 -2.1% -0.2% 10/31/2007 3.4% -1.5% 09/28/2007 4.8% -3.0% 08/31/2007 0.2% -0.1% 07/31/2007 -0.6% -1.4% 06/29/2007 -1.7% -0.3% 05/31/2007 0.8% 0.6% 04/30/2007 2.2% -1.1% 03/30/2007 1.5% -0.7% 02/28/2007 1.7% -1.0% 01/31/2007 0.9% 1.1% 12/29/2006 -0.1% 0.9% 11/30/2006 4.1% -1.7% 10/31/2006 3.3% -0.9% 09/29/2006 0.1% 1.0% 08/31/2006 1.9% -0.2% 07/31/2006 2.6% -0.2% 06/30/2006 0.7% 0.8% 05/31/2006 -0.1% -0.9% 04/28/2006 2.8% -3.6% 03/31/2006 1.0% 0.6% 02/28/2006 0.0% 0.9% 01/31/2006 4.6% -2.1% 12/30/2005 2.2% -0.5% 11/30/2005 1.5% 1.2% 10/31/2005 -3.2% 0.8% 09/30/2005 1.3% 1.5%\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., its affiliates, and employees do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
