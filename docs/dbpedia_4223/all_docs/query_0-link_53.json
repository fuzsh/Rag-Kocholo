        "text": "The Second World War was a global conflict that took place from 1939 to 1945, with its origins been traced back to the aftermath of World War I (1914-1918) and the treaties and conditions imposed upon defeated nations. World War II was the biggest and deadliest war in history, involving more than 30 countries, claiming the lives of over 50 million people. Despite the fact that the conflict spread across the globe, the majority of the actors made collective efforts to put an end to the Axis Powers' aggression; Germany, Italy, and Japan. The conflict divided nations into two major alliances. The Allies, led by Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and later the United States, sought to defeat the Axis Powers, consisting of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The war engulfed regions across the globe, including Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Although officially allies, Germany and Japan had very different motivations and goals, and their level of collaboration was mostly focused on diverting the attention of each other's adversaries rather than achieving any specific shared objectives.\n\nMilitary publishing house, Volume 1. The origin of war. The first volume of the \"History of the Second World War\" covers the period from the end of the First World War to the autumn of 1935. Its first part is devoted to the origin of war in the system of world imperialism, showing fascism as a strike force of imperialism and militarism, and the history of the emergence of the first centers of a new world war. The second part of the volume reveals the world-historical significance of the construction of socialism in the USSR, the development of its Armed Forces, the intense struggle of the peace-loving peoples, led by the Soviet Union, against the danger of a new world war. Translated by Svitlana M. for ML Discussion Group to study for the analysis of the war in Ukraine. Unedited.\n\nWorld War 2, also known as the Second World War, was a war fought from 1939 to 1945 in Europe and, during much of the 1930s and 1940s, in Asia. The war in Europe began in earnest on September 1, 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, and concluded on September 2, 1945, with the official surrender of the last Axis nation, Japan. However, in Asia the war began earlier with Japanese interventions in China, and in Europe, the war ended earlier with the unconditional surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945.\n\nWorld War I and World War II remain the two greatest military conflicts of modern times. The two wars involved alliances that included the majority of the most powerful nations of the entire globe. After the global devastation of World War I, many nations swore that they would never again engage in a conflict of such scale, but not twenty years later World War II broke out. Historians are left to answer whether or not the similarities among the causes of the two wars were greater than the differences. Though differences among the causes, as well as time, are great enough to distinguish the wars one from the other, I will attempt to argue that the similarities are indeed greater, though often dressed up in different circumstances, while considering economic, ideological, and strategic forces at play in both conflicts.\n\nThis course examines the global history of World War II from its origins in the ideological and strategic conflicts of the 1930s, through its major theaters, and finishing with the immediate postwar period. To sufficiently grasp the topic, the class shall explore the: diplomatic background to the launch of hostilities; imperial goals of the respective engaged powers; military imperatives driving battle outcomes; personal experiences of affected combatants and civilians; legacies of the settlements which defined the end of hostilities; and evolving historiography of the conflict. This version of the course will include multiple focuses and perspectives, which together will encourage the class to reflect on the long-term consequences of this global conflict. To that end, we will regularly read and discuss relevant news items pertaining to today's conflicts, and how the Second World War played a role in their evolution. There is no prerequisite for this course. Readings: Readings are drawn from the following required texts, as well as from class handouts posted on Canvas."
