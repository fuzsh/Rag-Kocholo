        "text": "The Receiver is a separate unit that is connected to the transmitter and to the DSU. It gets its power and antenna signal from the transmitter and is suitable for frequencies between 500 KHz and 30 MHz.\n\nThe receiver can also be used stand-alone in case of an emergency (e.g. when other modules have broken down). In that case an earphone can be connected to the front panel for the reception of spoken messages or morse code signals.\n\n➤ More information In the description above the complete FS-5000 station is shown with all modules installed at their default position. It was however possible to group some of the modules together in a different manner, so that the set could be used for more than one application. Below is a description of the currently known configurations. If you know of another one, please let us know. In some countries it was possible to use the receiver stand-alone in case of an emergency (e.g. when the other units failed). The H-bar was then used to connect the receiver to a single battery and the small control panel on the side of the receiver was used to adjust the frequency.\n\nPlease note that this mode of operation was not possible with the FS-5000M that was used in Germany. It can be modified however.\n\n➤ More information The image on the right shows the contents of the carton. There were 4 large and 4 smaller containers, each holding one or more modules. The modules themselves are each packed in plastic, in order to protect them when stored for longer periods of time. A small container with the DSU is missing in the picture.\n\nEach container has a label with the serial number and a letter denoting the module that is stored inside it. If more than one module is packed inside a container, multiple labels are present. The meaning of the letters is listed above. In the early 1980s, the ACC (Allied Clandestine Committee), attached to NATO headquarters SHAPE in Mons (Belgium), decided to develop a pan-European communication system for all stay-behind organisations in Europe, including non-NATO countries such as Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nIn the early days of the Cold War, it was believed that the governments of most European countries would make their way to England when their countries were invaded by the Soviets. For this reason, some Harpoon FS-5000 sets were installed there. Later, when nuclear weapons became available to the USSR, the general consent was that the European goverments would escape to the US. Arrangments were therefore made, to have some FS-5000 radio sets in the US as well. These sets were delivered to the American National Security Agency (NSA). The FS-5000 was suitable for this, as it was specified for a range of 6000 km!\n\nAs it was impossible for the (secret) stay-behind organisations to deal directly with Telefunken, the German intelligence service (BND) acted as a facade and ordered 854 units from Telefunken, for a total amount of 130 million German Marks (equivalent to 65 million Euros) [4]. The first sets were delivered in 1988, and by March 1991 all FS-5000 radio sets had been delivered to the various countries [6]. Stay-behind personnel was trained on the new radio and the first long-range field tests (LOR) were successfully completed in 1990 [6 p.139]. Shortly afterwards, after a series of scandals, most European countries decided to dismantle their stay-behind organisation.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Gladio had become history. All field agents had been detached and the Harpoon radio sets (FS-5000) were collected and stored. As the cost of development of the FS-5000 was quite substantial, a new destination was sought for some of the equipment. In 1991, the USA decided to give the FS-5000 a real-life field test, by using it in the First Gulf War. The American Special Forces (SF) however, had trouble operating the radio and concluded that it was impractical and unsuitable for SF use. They were probably right, as the radio set was developed for a total different purpose. In 2000 some of these American FS-5000 units accidently appeared on the surplus market, albeit without the DSU. When the mistake was discovered, the remaining sets were quickly withdrawn, but a mere 22 units had already found a new home.\n\nWhether or not the above story is correct, remains to be seen. It is very unlikely that the American SF or the CIA would use former stay-behind equipment in a war theatre, whilst they had plently of alternative equipment available from US sources. It is far more likely that the story of 'bad radios' was invented to masquerade the accidental and unintended release of FS-5000 units in the US. For the transmission of message bursts, the transmitter uses a very sophisticated modulation technique, called Vestigial Side Band Modulation (VSB or C1D), compatible with ECHOTEL. This allows the transmitter to send a message over a channel with an extremely narrow bandwidth at a speed of 2000 baud. As a result, sending a 55 character message takes no more than 0.8 sec. [A], making Direction Finding (DF) practically impossible! Although this technique was already used in 1967 for (computer) modem signals, it was relatively new for use on HF-radio in 1985. The principle is explained in a number of US patents that were filed around this time [7] [8] [9].\n\nThe receiver uses Single Side Band (SSB or J2B) with single-channel FSK for the reception of data messages at a speed of 75 baud. As the receiver uses a different type of modulation and a different baud rate, it is not compatible with the transmitter. It is therefore not possible to communicate directly between two FS-5000 field stations. Communication was only possible between an FS-5000 and a BS-5000 (or BS-7010) base station.\n\nThe block diagram above shows roughly how the various components of the FS-5000 are used together. All frequencies and tuning signals are derived from the receiver where they are generated by a synthesizer running on a 10MHz TCXO. The DSU controls all units and set the RX and TX frequencies. The antenna signal for the receiver is normally supplied by the Antenna Tuner (ATU) through the transmitter. Only when the alternative telescopic antenna is used, a separate pre-amplifier is activated. More details on the relevant pages. A good explanation of the mathematical backgrounds of VSB is given by Phil Schniter on the Connexions website [B]."
