        "text": "It depends when it falls, it nearly did in September 1942 but for a relief attempt against the Axis blockade that finally worked, but very nearly was defeated. I'm not sure if Operation Herkules was viable and by 1942 largely the chance to profit from taking it was already gone. The big chance was in the 2nd half of 1941 when Rommel first got there, that is when Malta really was able to stop Rommel and disrupt his logistics so badly he was trapped in his position on the Egyptian-Libyan border, despite having numerical parity with the Brits; he couldn't assault the surrounded Tobruk and take it because of Malta related supply issues, while the Brits had time to build up and launch Operation Crusader, which finally drove him back to nearly Tripoli.\n\nIf the Italians had attacked Malta shortly after declaring war they easily could have taken the island. Instead they made a mediocre march into France who appeared about to fall, afraid to draw British ire. When the UK didn't fold with France, Mussolini went after Egypt due to Malta's reinforcement.\n\nMussolini wanted cheap, easy victories; not extended conflicts with stronger nations. If he'd gone after Malta while simply guarding his border against the French, maybe the loss would have shocked the British into second-guessing continuing the war, but probably not. It may, though, have convinced Churchill to abandon the Eastern Med like his advisors told him to.\n\nThis is spot on. Had Italy gone for Malta in 1940 they could have taken it and saved the Axis a ton of trouble and potentially even avoided the issues with invading Egypt in 1940 and the results of Operation Compass...though potentially butterflying away Rommel's intervention. The only issue I have with the above statement is that the attack on France was only meant to achieve a seat at the peace table so that Mussolini could get cheap territorial gains, which he did (Corsica and border adjustments with France), which satisfied his political agenda even though it had next to no practical strategic benefit for the Axis war effort and perhaps distracted from more important objectives (with hindsight) like Malta, though I think Italy had the strength to do both at the same time if they chose to.\n\nIt depends when it falls, it nearly did in September 1942 but for a relief attempt against the Axis blockade that finally worked, but very nearly was defeated.

In 1940 Italy had no Marines (not real ones) and the 3 'battalions' of Paratroopers from 3 disparate parts of the Italian military which were only effectively stood up late that year after the success of the Fallschirmjager in Western Europe and Norway so would have lacked Experience, expertise, equipment and the knowledge of their commanders to know how best to use them.\n\nThe only way that Malta falls in late 1940 is via an administrative occupation.\n\nHow could they have taken it?

The 3rd Battalion of the 'San Marco' Regiment, which became known as the Tobruk battalion,[5] repelled landings by British Commandos at Tobruk during the night of 13/14 September 1942, in the course of the botched Operation Agreement. As a result, 200 British Commandos were taken prisoner.\n\nMalta was so lightly defended in 1940 due to Britain assuming the island was indefensible that they could have taken it relatively easily without a marine or para division.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Malta_(World_War_II)#Background\n\nThere were hardly any defences on Malta because of a pre-war conclusion that the island was indefensible. The Italian and British surface fleets were evenly matched in the region but the Italians had far more submarines and aircraft. The Admiralty had to protect the Suez Canal with the Mediterranean Fleet (Admiral Andrew Cunningham) and Gibraltar with Force H (Vice-Admiral James Somerville).[16] In October 1939, the Mediterranean Fleet was transferred eastwards to Egypt, stripping the island of its naval protection. Only the monitor HMS Terror and a few British submarines were still based at the island. When the Maltese government questioned British reasoning, they were told that the island could be defended just as adequately from Alexandria as from Grand Harbour, which was untrue. This led the Maltese to doubt the British commitment to defend the island.[17]\n\nWhile the concerns that the island, far from Britain and close to Italy, could not be defended, the British decided in July 1939 to increase the number of anti-aircraft guns and fighter aircraft on Malta.[18] The British leadership had further doubts about whether to hold the island in May 1940, when during the Battle of France the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud suggested that the Italian prime minister and dictator Benito Mussolini might be appeased by concessions, including Malta. After some discussion, Winston Churchill convinced the British War Cabinet that no concessions should be made.[19] With the British home islands in danger, the defence of Malta was not the priority and it was lightly protected. Only six obsolete Gloster Sea Gladiator biplanes were stationed on the island, with another six in crates, when on 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on the United Kingdom and France.[16] In the 1930s, Italy had sought to expand in the Mediterranean and Africa, regions dominated by the British and French. The Allied defeat in France from Mayâ€“June 1940 removed the French Navy from the Allied order of battle and tilted the balance of naval and air power in Italy's favour.[20][21]\n\nIn 1940, an Italian assault on Malta stood a reasonable chance of gaining control of the island, an action giving the Italians naval and air supremacy in the central Mediterranean.[23] The Mediterranean would have been split in two, separating the British bases at Gibraltar and Alexandria.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marco_Regiment\n\nMalta was so lightly defended in 1940 due to Britain assuming the island was indefensible that they could have taken it relatively easily without a marine or para division.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Malta_(World_War_II)#Background\n\nLightly defended in Nov 1939 = A slightly understrength Divisions with 4 Regular British Battalions and 3 Maltese TA Battalions of the The Kings Own Malta Regiment and the 7th HAA Regiment RA + lots of Local Volunteers of the Maltese Aux Corps\n\nBy May 1940 - the 8th Battalion of the Manchester Regiment had arrived and by Sept the 29th HAA Regiment RA.\n\nThe San Marco Regiment were Marines in name only - a single Battalion had been used as a Colonial Garrison force in China between the wars and a second was raised in 1939\n\nWhile they were tasked early war as 'Marine Infantry' and while solid troops (1st battalion had been comprised of long service volunteers) during the war they lacked any real equipment or operational experience for this role - certainly at this time and their only real success in this role was 'capturing' some barely defended Greek Islands.\n\nThe only way Italian troops are realistically taking the island in late 1940 is if the British do not contest an administrative style invasion - they are not storming the beaches.\n\nLightly defended in Nov 1939 = A slightly understrength Divisions with 4 Regular British Battalions and 3 Maltese TA Battalions of the The Kings Own Malta Regiment and the 7th HAA Regiment RA + lots of Local Volunteers of the Maltese Aux Corps\n\nBy May 1940 - the 8th Battalion of the Manchester Regiment had arrived and by Sept the 29th HAA Regiment RA.\n\nThe San Marco Regiment were Marines in name only - a single Battalion had been used as a Colonial Garrison force in China between the wars and a second was raised in 1939\n\nWhile they were tasked early war as 'Marine Infantry' and while solid troops (1st battalion had been comprised of long service volunteers) during the war they lacked any real equipment or operational experience for this role - certainly at this time and their only real success in this role was 'capturing' some barely defended Greek Islands.\n\nThe only way Italian troops are realistically taking the island in late 1940 is if the British do not contest an administrative style invasion - they are not storming the beaches.\n\nNo equipment for them, plus virtually no naval or air support means doom. Naval infantry were trained for naval landings, if you read the article on them there were units readying themselves for a naval landing against France in 1940 that never happened. The Italians also conducted naval landings in Crete to support the German in 1941. They had the forces to conduct landings. Plus as the Japanese found out, unsupported islands held by weak forces and no air support (also Malta did not have prepared underground defenses as of 1940 that project started during the war), meant an island would fall rapidly. Since the Italians could use air bases 90 miles away, plus all the naval forces at their muster, there is little a reinforced division could do to hold and island that was not expected or prepared to be held in the event of war with the Italians.\n\nNo equipment for them, plus virtually no naval or air support means doom.

There weren't prepared defenses underground to protect against air and naval bombardment, 6 bi-wing fighters, and no hope for rapid support given that the Brits had prioritized defense of their other outposts and the Home Isles in June 1940. The Brits did not yet know the combat abilities of the Italians, so aren't going to risk the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1940 to save the island. All then the defenders of Malta can do is inflict casualties on the invaders, but the end is not in doubt without any air cover or naval support. Suppressed defenders can't really resist and invader capable of bombarding an island with impunity.\n\nSo in May 1941 the Italians manage to land a Regiment of troops on an undefended beach (Sitra on the east end of the Island) using ad hoc vessels - with the landing ships quite correctly leaving as soon as they could before the RN found them\n\nIt was good manoeuvre and bailed out the Fjs who having suffered heavy losses were stalled vs the British at Heraklion - the British Brigade withdrew from the area in the face of the landing - 'but' it was an Administrative landing not an assault - if thats what they planned for Malta then fine most nations militaries could quite happily carry out such a task - except of course if anyone started shooting at them the are ruined and at Malta some one would have started shooting at them!\n\nIt would have failed which is why it was not attempted\n\nIn 1940 no one was capable of conducting an opposed assault of the nature required to capture Malta\n\nTo me an invasion has to happen before Malta is reinforced. The firstsignificant reinforcement is operation hats in September. Any invasion of Malta has to happen before that to be viable.\n\nOperation Hurry was an aircraft run which brought 12 hurricanes and 2 skua to Malta, the first monoplanes in the defence of Malta. An invasion of Malta should happen before this occurred at the end of July.\n\nThere was defensive minefield laid until September or October 1940 and that was limited. Again an invasion must occur before this date.\n\nThe largest guns available to the defence was 9.2 inch guns. Wiki mentions 12 inch and 16 inch guns but the citation is innacurate so I do not believe it.\n\nSo to me what does the Italians need. They need Marines, paratroopers, and all the naval and air support they can manage. A gun line providing fire support can make a landing that otherwise would be difficult doable. However it might mean one less convoy to North Africa in the first months of the war."
