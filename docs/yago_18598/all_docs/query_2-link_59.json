        "text": "They may not be playing Danny and Tess Ocean this time, but George Clooney and Julia Roberts are starring opposite each other as exes on the big screen once again in Ticket to Paradise. See a sneak peek of the romantic comedy in a new trailer below.\n\nThe movie follows Clooney and Roberts' characters who are divorced as they travel to Bali to stop their daughter (played by Kaitlyn Dever) from making the same relationship mistake they think they made 25 years ago (i.e. marrying someone at her young age).\n\nAlthough things get off to a very rocky start when the two are surprisingly seated next to each other on the plane out there and he tells a flight attendant their marriage was \"the worst 19 years of my life,\" even though they were only married for five (\"I'm counting the recovery,\" he notes), naturally, when they team back up, old sparks reignite.\n\n\"I won't let her throw her life away. We need to trick her into dumping him,\" Roberts' character tells Clooney's character in the trailer. \"As much as this will pain us both, we have to call a truce to make this work.\"\n\nThe film comes from writer-director Ol Parker and writer Daniel Pipski. Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Sarah Harvey, Deborah Balderstone, Clooney, Grant Heslov, Roberts, Lisa Roberts Gillan, and Marisa Yeres Gill serve as producers. Billie Lourd, Lucas Bravo, and Maxime Bouttie also star.\n\nTicket to Paradise opens in theaters on Oct. 21."
