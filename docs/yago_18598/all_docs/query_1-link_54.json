        "text": "Early life\n\nDellal was born in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, to immigrant Iraqi Jews Sulman Dellal and Charlotte Shashoua. He was educated at Heaton Moor College, also in Manchester.\n\nCareer\n\nDellal was a banker in the 1970s. He owned the Dalton Barton bank, which he sold to Keyser Ullman for £58 million. He set up Allied Commercial in 1974 with Stanley Van Gelder, with whom he worked for over forty years. One of their deals was the flip of central London's Bush House, which made £750 million within two years. He was said to have invested up to £200m in London's Dolphin Square.\n\nDellal's nickname, \"Black Jack\", was popularly said to have derived from his love of gambling. But he also often recalled being nicknamed \"Black Jack\" as a young boy at school in Manchester, to make the distinction between him and a fairer boy named Jack.\n\nPersonal life\n\nThrough two marriages and at least one long term relationship, he had nine children, seven daughters and two sons.\n\nZehava Helmer: (1952-1975; divorced) - Guy (businessman), Lorraine, Suzanne, Diane and Gaby (film director)\n\nKatya Douglas: - Jasmine (film director) and Rowan\n\nRuanne (née Louw) : £ 700 million former Miss South Africa: marriage (1997-2012, his death) - Zack and Catherine. Dellal left £1.2 billion to each Catherine and Zack out of his fortune\n\nIn memory of his daughter Suzanne, Jack founded the Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater in Tel Aviv in 1989.\n\nGuy was a director of Allied Commercial Holdings, who ran Allied Commercial along with his father from 1986, and took over operational ownership years before Jack died. Today he is an investment partner of Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz, and an art dealer, said to be worth around £200 million in 2014.\n\nDeath\n\nDellal died in his sleep in London on 28 October 2012, aged 89."
