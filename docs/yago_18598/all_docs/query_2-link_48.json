        "text": "Peacock has unveiled a trailer, premiere date and first look photos for Genie, its previously untitled holiday fairytale comedy, starring Melissa McCarthy and Paapa Essiedu, which Love Life creator Sam Boyd directed from a script by Richard Curtis, the Oscar nom best known for Love Actually.\n\nHailing from Universal and Working Title, the film premieres November 22nd. Check out the trailer above, and new photos above and below.\n\nMcCarthy leads the pic as Flora, a genie trapped for more than 2,000 years inside an antique jewelry box because of one teeny-tiny little misunderstanding with a sorcerer back in 77 B.C. After millennia of being summoned to grant wishes of gold doubloons and hot babes for greedy men, Flora is accidentally called to service by Bernard Bottle (Essiedu), whose life is unraveling around him.\n\nBernard’s been so busy working that he has lost sight of his marriage to his wife Julie (Denée Benton) and the childhood of his young daughter, Eve (Jordyn Mcintosh). When Bernard misses Eve’s birthday 12 days before Christmas because of work, Julie decides it’s time for a trial separation. And then Bernard’s tyrannical boss (Alan Cumming) fires him. Alone in his New York City apartment, a despondent Bernard dusts off a jewelry box he finds in their home and unintentionally releases the one entity who just might be able to help him get his family back. Maybe. Possibly. It’s a longshot, frankly. But in the process, Flora and Bernard will discover that love, and an unexpected friendship, can unleash a special holiday magic all its own.\n\nAlso starring Marc Maron (GLOW), Luis Guzmán (Hightown), Tate Ellington (The Brave), and LaChanze (Broadway’s The Color Purple), Genie is produced by Working Title’s Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, Riva Marker (The Guilty, Beasts of No Nation), and Curtis. Exec producers are McCarthy, Caroline Jaczko, Nicole King, Stacy O’Neil, Alexandra Loewy, and Sarah-Jane Robinson."
