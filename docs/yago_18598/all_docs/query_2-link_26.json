        "text": "The Bafta award for outstanding contribution to British film has been given to two of the most important figures in the British movie industry - the founders of Working Title films.\n\nFellner and Bevan formed their company in 1992\n\nTim Bevan and Eric Fellner have been described as the \"Brit flick's twin towers of power\", Britain's \"movie moguls\" and \"gamblers with excellent taste and instincts\".\n\nBut whatever tag you want to apply to the two producers and founders of Working Title films, one thing is certain: the British film industry would be poorer without them.\n\nThey have been listed as the most powerful figures in the British industry and in 2002 Premiere magazine put them at 41st in the world-wide movie power list.\n\nA roll call of their films is a virtual name check of all of the biggest British films of the last 10 years.\n\nWorking Title hits\n\nFour Weddings\n\nBean\n\nNotting Hill\n\nBridget Jones's Diary\n\nTheir films have grossed more than $1.8 billion (£1.12 billion) in the last 12 years, and that is a conservative estimate.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that the pair are worth at least £20m each.\n\n\"They are energetic, not naive, not arty-farty, or up their own arses,\" said actor Hugh Grant, who has worked with the pair on four films.\n\nThey have not just contributed financially to the industry. Working Title films have also backed critically-acclaimed films and American independent successes.\n\nCritical successes\n\nDead Man Walking\n\nElizabeth\n\nFargo\n\nThe Man Who Wasn't There\n\nO Brother Where Art Thou?\n\nStrangely, for such successful film figures, the two maintain a very low profile at odds with the industry in which they work.\n\nNew Zealand-born Bevan started his career as a production runner on soap opera, Close to Home, before serving his apprenticeship at the National Film Unit.\n\nIn the early 1980s he moved to Britain and started working at Video Arts, John Cleese's successful corporate training production house.\n\nLaunch\n\nIn 1983 he started a music video production company, Aldabra, which was to become Working Title films a year later.\n\nIts first feature, My Beautiful Laundrette, helped launch the careers of director Stephen Frears and Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nWhen you talk to one, you always feel you are talking to the other one as well\n\nStephen Daldry\n\nFellner too started in music videos, making promos for bands such as Duran Duran and Fleetwood Mac.\n\nHe moved into British films, producing The Rachel Papers and Sid and Nancy, among others at Initial Pictures.\n\nHe left Initial to join Bevan in 1992.\n\nThe early films were a mixture of left-of-centre independent films, such as Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, and support for American indie productions, such as Tim Robbins' Bob Roberts.\n\nWorking Title's breakthrough hit was 1994's Four Weddings and a Funeral, a romantic comedy which made the term British blockbuster seem less of an oxymoron.\n\nGrant has been a regular performer for Working Title\n\nAfter a long dry period with few international hits, the production company proved that the British could once again fashion films with global appeal.\n\nInternational successes followed: among them, French Kiss, Dead Man Walking, Fargo, Bean and Elizabeth, mixing critical with commercial successes.\n\nIn 1999 Working Title signed a reported $600m deal with film giant Universal. While the overall deal is probably exaggerated, it gave the pair the power to commission films with a budget up to $35m without even consulting their pay masters.\n\nEpicentre\n\n\"I think anyone in Hollywood would want to do business with these guys,\" said the former Universal Studios boss Edgar Bronfman Jr, now a chief executive with USA Interactive.\n\nThey have fashioned success despite being thousands of miles away from the epicentre of the industry.\n\nBut their relationship with Hollywood has always been strong.\n\nBridget Jones was an international hit\n\nDirector Alex Cox has spoken of how Fellner, in a bid to keep the film Straight to Hell on track, flew to Los Angeles and returned with a suitcase of money.\n\nBut not all of their films have been unqualified successes - as one would expect in the movie industry.\n\nFlops include Captain Corelli's Mandolin. It was their most expensive film and, ironically, the one that seemed most likely to succeed.\n\nAdapted from the widly popular book of the same name, with an all-star cast, it still managed to disappoint with the critics and at the box office.\n\nDespite their low profile, Bevan is seen as the \"flashier\" of the two, with more commercial instincts.\n\nAlthough this probably stems from a \"celebrity marriage\" to Joely Richardson, which ended in divorce, and once being listed by Tatler magazine as one of the most \"dateable boys\".\n\nFellner, predictably, is seen as the more arty of the partnership.\n\n\"They cover each other and complement each other,\" Stacey Snider, chairman of Universal Pictures has said.\n\nShe added: \"Tim has incredible drive and focus, while Eric can smooth ruffled feathers anytime. And they're both material driven, which is rare.\"\n\nTheir most recent success is the launch of WT2, an offshoot designed to produce smaller budget films.\n\nIts first film, Billy Elliot, was a huge success.\n\nDirector Stephen Daldry said: \"The joy of them is that they strangely never contradict each other, and despite the fact that they have different personalities, they are in agreement.\n\nWhen you talk to one, you always feel you are talking to the other one as well.\""
