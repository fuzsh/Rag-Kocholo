Action/horror. Believed to be a myth, something only to be found in horror films, people soon discover that vampires do indeed live among humans. However, these blood-thirsty creatures are not the infallible undead from folklore but living beings with one significant trait that sets them apart from others - infected blood that speeds up their metabolism. With an increased bone density, these Vampires have the ability to move a thousand times faster and be hundred times stronger. To the government's dismay, more of the population is becoming hemophages (vampires), and they have set out to rid the world of what they deem as a menace to society. One rogue vampire is bent on protecting her race - and seeking revenge on those that changed her life forever. With fierce fighting skills and the ability to change and project her image, Violet (Milla Jovovich) sets out to destroy a government-designed time bomb that will kill all hemophages. To Violet's surprise, the deadly device is a nine-year-old boy, who goes by the name Six (Cameron Bright) and was raised in a laboratory. Determined to save the child, Violet wages her own personal war against the other vampires who want the boy dead and the special security forces who need him alive. Drawing upon every power given to her by the virus, she becomes a one-person army, blazing her way through vicious attacks and taking no prisoners. However, Violet soon discovers that Six was created for a larger and much deadlier purpose - a secret government conspiracy that threatens to not only exterminate Violet and her people but all of mankind.
