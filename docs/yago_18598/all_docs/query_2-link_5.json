Bevan and Fellner are the most successful British producers of their era. Through 2017, the films he has co-produced have grossed a total of almost $7 billion worldwide.[3] As of 2017, films by Working Title Films have won 12 Academy Awards and 39 British Academy Film Awards.[4][5][6]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nBevan was born in 1957 in Queenstown, New Zealand.[7][1] From 1969—1974, he was educated at Sidcot School,[8] a Quaker boarding independent school in the Mendip Hills, near the village of Winscombe in North Somerset, in South West England.

Working Title are also notable for their long-time collaboration with American filmmakers the Coen brothers, having produced Barton Fink (1991), Fargo (1996), The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), The Big Lebowski (1998), and O Brother, Where Art Thou? among others.\n\nWorking Title signed a deal with Universal Studios in 1999 for a reported US$600 million, which gave Bevan and Fellner the power to commission projects with a budget of up to $35 million without having to consult their paymasters.[11]\n\nBevan is a co-producer of the West End musical Billy Elliot.[12]\n\nBevan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2005 Birthday Honours for services to the British film industry.[13]\n\nIn 2013, he and Fellner received the David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures from the Producers Guild of America.[14]\n\nAlong with Fellner, Lisa Bryer, David Heyman, Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson, he founded the London Screen Academy in September 2019, a sixth form school teaching behind the camera skills to a student body of 800.[15]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBevan is divorced from English actress Joely Richardson; the two have a daughter, Daisy, born in 1992.
