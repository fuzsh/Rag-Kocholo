Dellal came under controversy for an interview she gave before the film's release during which she referred to the character Ray, played by Fanning, using female pronouns and referring to the character as \"a girl who is presenting in a very ineffectual way as a boy.\" Dellal later stated that she used female pronouns because she was referring to the actress Fanning, not the character, when she made the remark. The film will be distributed by The Weinstein Company in May 2017.\n\nPersonal life\n\nDellal was previously married to producer Eric Fellner, with whom she has three sons.\n\nFilmography\n\nActress\n\n1991\n\nK2 as\n\nFrench Woman (as Gabrielle Dellal)\n\n1988\n\nHard Cases (TV Series) as\n\nLeonie Friedman\n\n- Episode #1.6 (1988) - Leonie Friedman (as Gabrielle Dellal)\n\n- Episode #1.5 (1988) - Leonie Friedman (as Gabrielle Dellal)\n\n- Episode #1.4 (1988) - Leonie Friedman (as Gabrielle Dellal)\n\n- Episode #1.3 (1988) - Leonie Friedman (as Gabrielle Dellal)\n\n- Episode #1.2 (1988) - Leonie Friedman (as Gabrielle Dellal)\n\n- Episode #1.1 (1988) - Leonie Friedman (as Gabrielle Dellal)\n\n1987\n\nFloodtide (TV Series) as\n\nTessa Waite / Tessa\n\n- Seven: Snowstorm (1987) - Tessa\n\n- Six: Prisoners (1987) - Tessa\n\n- Five: The Catch (1987) - Tessa Waite\n\n- Four: The Trial (1987) - Tessa Waite\n\n- Three: Words of Warning (1987) - Tessa Waite\n\n- Two: Observations (1987) - Tessa Waite\n\n- One: The Call (1987) - Tessa Waite (as Gabrielle Dellal)\n\n1986\n\n'Allo 'Allo!
