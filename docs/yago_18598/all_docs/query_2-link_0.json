        "text": "We are trying to up the ante a little bit in terms of the scale and diversity of films we make ... You have to have films that are going to do $200-$400m in box office revenue, and finding them from here [Britain] is difficult.\n\nI guess technically not owning the company means we lost control, but the way the film business works is that it's people-driven rather than structure-driven. Tim and I are by profession film producers, and the business of Working Title is producing films. By dint of that we get to run it how we want. The production company itself will never be a profitable company. The value is not in ownership of the company but in part ownership, as we ultimately have, of the rights of any film made."
