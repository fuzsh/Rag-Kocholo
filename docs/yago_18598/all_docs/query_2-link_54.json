        "text": "www.telegaph.co.uk\n\nCool and collected, the model Laura Bailey is the picture of English reserve - especially when it comes to questions about her rackety childhood and affair with Richard Gere. So with her modelling career on hold for her second pregnancy, what's occupying her now, asks Lucy Cavendish\n\nBefore I meet the model Laura Bailey her publicist gives me a list of things not to ask her about. I am not to talk about Richard Gere (she had a brief relationship with him 14 years ago), or the film producer Eric Fellner, who is her current long-standing beau. She has one child with him, three-year-old Luc, and is pregnant with their second. I am also not allowed to talk to her about the size-zero thing. I wasn't actually going to ask her about it. She's pregnant - why would I talk to a pregnant woman about being size zero? But I am also not sure why it is such an issue.\n\nAnyway, the upshot of all this is that by the time I do meet Bailey, who is one of the faces of the highly successful Marks & Spencer ad campaign, alongside Twiggy and Erin O'Connor, I am wondering why she is being so precious about everything. After all, it's not as if she has any overt reason to be so private. Laura Bailey is a model who used to ride a Vespa. She is vegetarian. She likes to pamper herself at the Cowshed in Notting Hill, near where she lives. She works for Unicef. She has, in the past, tried her hand at acting, not too successfully, and also writing, at which she has done much better. She's written travel pieces for newspapers and has also taken the photographs.\n\n'I went to Rwanda,' she says. 'I am very happy with my camera and a notebook, and I like meeting new people.' I tell her I read an article she wrote for Vogue about her 30th birthday. It was spent on a beach in Ibiza with friends. 'My guests spanned the generations ranging from six to 60,' she wrote. 'I swam with the children, indulged in an obligatory cry with my best friend, danced like a dervish (in four different dresses)… and stole quiet moments with much older men offering lessons in life and love.' Good grief! It sounds some party, but when I ask her about this, she says rather primly, 'That was six years ago. Let's focus on the present.'\n\nBut let's go back to when we meet. Laura Bailey is here to discuss the new online maternity clothes range Mama-la-mode. Apparently, it's a bit like Net-a-porter but for pregnant women. Seven months' pregnant, Bailey floats around in a variety of stylish black tops and bottoms, and her belly is so minute she looks as though she has barely done more than eat a large lunch. Maybe this is why she's touchy about her size.\n\n'I feel huge, though,' says Bailey as she rearranges the loose black dress she is wearing. Is this a Mama-la-mode outfit? 'Actually,' she says, 'I don't wear maternity clothes. I just wear my usual clothes in larger sizes.' This must be why she continues to look so glamorous. When I see her on television a few days later with Fellner, one of the brains behind Working Title, who was nominated for a Bafta for Atonement, she is looking amazing, and is certainly not wearing anything that smacks of a tent. 'I do think Mama-la-mode is great, though,' she says loyally. 'The clothes are comfortable and very stylish, and all you need to do is go online. It's so easy.'\n\nadvertisement\n\nOf course, there are problems in all this, the main one being that Bailey would probably look stylish in anything. She is tall and blonde and very slender, and has a face like a startled deer. I think it's her huge eyes and long legs. Her legs look even longer today as she is wearing a pair of vertiginous platform heels. I squeak when I see them, wondering how on earth she manages to walk in them when she's so pregnant. 'I've been to a casting,' she says. 'I get curves when I'm pregnant. I'm usually flat-chested, but now I've got boobs, so I'm finally the right shape for Vivienne Westwood.'\n\nHowever, she says she's not working much at the moment. 'Modelling maternity wear is a happy challenge,' she says. 'I work a minimum amount while I am pregnant. I try to stay fit and healthy. I want to savour this pregnancy as it is probably my last.' How can she know this? She's only 36 years old. 'It's my boyfriend's fifth child,' she says. She always refers to Fellner as her boyfriend. She says she loves having a child because it helps with her work-life balance.\n\n'Modelling is an unpredictable profession,' she says. 'Sometimes I am at home with Luc a lot; other times I'm off travelling on a shoot. But I love working. I think it makes me a better mother and a nicer person.' She says she'll probably be back at work by the end of the summer because she didn't find it hard getting back into shape after she had Luc. 'I burn off so much energy running around after him. I'm sure it will be the same this time,' she says. 'That's how it is with children, isn't it?'\n\nThe easy weight-loss doesn't happen for everyone I say, but, then again, Laura Bailey isn't everyone. She is the person who, in her early twenties, caught the eye of Richard Gere and ended up being photographed climbing sans shoes over the wall of the Chelsea house where he was staying. Her subsequent relationship with Gere - once it became obvious that his marriage to the supermodel Cindy Crawford was over - catapulted Bailey to stardom. In the past she has said things like, 'It was a rollercoaster romance with a man twice my age. I was swept into a sophisticated world of art and artifice, Hollywood and a hell of a lot of air miles.' She describes how at dinner parties with Gere she'd be the only one under 40, and how gauche she felt. In an interview three years ago she said, 'It took me a long time not to have that startled, rabbit-in-the-headlights feeling, but now I'm really over hiding in the corner.'\n\nWell, that's certainly true as, post Gere, she's had a very glamorous life living in London and New York and, most recently, becoming a household name as a stalwart of the M&S ads for the past two and a half years. 'We have a tremendous amount of fun doing those adverts,' she says. Erin O'Connor has been a friend of hers for years, but now she would count all the others - Elizabeth Jagger, Twiggy et al - as being close friends as well. 'We all hang out together and we ring each other all the time. We're an unusual group, but it works so well. I feel as if we are always on some Enid Blyton adventure, running round town. It's nice and escapist.'\n\nThere were reports a few months ago, however, that Bailey had been dropped from the M&S campaigns because of her pregnancy. Is this true? 'No,' she says opening her eyes even wider. 'I mean, you can never really say what is going to happen in the world of fashion but, as far as I know, it's all continuing as usual. This is spring/summer right now, and that's swimwear, and I don't do swimwear.' She is, however, a sort of roving ambassador for M&S. 'I am very involved in the programme that M&S is doing with Oxfam. The idea is that, if people take their old M&S clothes to be recycled, they will get a £5 M&S voucher.' This chimes in with her commitment to promoting Fairtrade within the fashion industry. 'All these projects make sense to me,' she says. 'I have learnt a lot from being involved in them. Maybe it's something to do with age.'\n\nThen again, Bailey always seems to have been pretty switched-on. She wasn't spotted until she was 22 years old, which makes her older than most models, but it's something she is now thankful for. 'I was walking home from work and I got approached by a spotter for a model agency,' she says. 'I could not have coped with it if I had been much younger. It's a strange and demanding job.' She hadn't actually thought about being a model at the time, though. She'd been to Southampton University and had a degree - a first in English - but then she started modelling and found that she really liked it. 'I've travelled all over the world,' she says. 'I like the stimulation of meeting new people. You make friends quickly as there is something so intimate about a fashion shoot - people are doing your hair and make-up and dressing you. I enjoy the process and the opportunities that have arisen from it.'\n\nThere is something about Bailey that is peculiarly English. She has a slightly jolly-hockey-sticks air and one of those breathy 'golly gosh' accents - a bit bluestocking, a bit I've-grown-up-in-the-country. She actually grew up outside Oxford and had a rather chaotic family life. She claimed in the Vogue piece never to have spent Christmas in the same place twice. 'One year I'd be at a rave with Tibetan monks… another I'd be in New York, where I found myself biking round the city between a Jewish breakfast, a slap-up expat-British roast lunch and an Italian supper.'\n\nHer childhood has, in the past, been described as one long search for a 'family'. After her father and mother separated she spent her time at the house of her father, an academic at Brasenose College, 'wiping off her eyeliner and turning up with homework and hockey sticks', and the rest of the time searching vaguely for replacement mother-figures due to her own mother's emotional absence. 'I drifted further and further from my fragmented family - an absent father (and mother, come to that) - to seek an alternative support system,' she has written.\n\nHer refusal to talk now about her childhood is, I think, a shame, as it sounds so fascinating. There are many tales swirling around it - how she would dress up her half-brother Theo as a girl; how she would charm the caretaker at Brasenose into buying her Quality Street; how she would constantly impinge on other people's families, watching with amazement tinged with envy as they sat down to a daily family meal - but Bailey says she doesn't want to delve into her past. 'My future,' she says patting her bump, 'is here and with my boyfriend and Luc.'\n\nShe has obviously now found her alternative support system in Fellner. They have been together for a few years now, and are very happy. They both seem delighted they are having another child. 'It's odd, though,' says Bailey. 'I can't remember anything about babies at all. It's as if Luc was never a baby, so it's all going to feel very new to me.' She says that having Luc has been good for her because before him she was very disorganised. 'I used to be very shoddy,' she says. 'I was always late. I let people down. I was messy and all over the place, and now I just can't be. I'm on time and ready to work, and then I want to go home to Luc. I am no longer that cool, fashionably late person.'\n\nShe says she counts her lucky stars that, despite her age, she's always been able to find work. 'It must be genetics,' she says. 'I mean, there will always be a demand for skinny 16-year-olds, that's the nature of fashion, but people also seem to appreciate a face that shows signs of character. All I know is that I enjoy it more now than I did when I started. I know how my world works now, and that makes me happy and confident. I am less \"invested\" in it, but in a good way.'\n\nNow she says she must go, because Luc is waiting for her to come home. 'I'm managing my time, you see?' she says raising an arched eyebrow, and then she walks, or rather totters, on to the street, all long legs and terrifying heels."
