        "text": "The first thing you notice about Elle Macpherson is that she looks exactly as you remember her from her Sports Illustrated days—even though it’s been more than a decade since she appeared on the magazine’s cover. As she careens up a narrow dirt road at the wheel of a vintage mint-green Fiat Jolly mini-car to meet me, she is wearing her signature black wraparound sunglasses and—what else?—a bikini. We’re in the Bahamas, after all, not far from the house where she spends four months of each year. In the passenger seat is her younger son, Cy, who, like many two-year-olds, prefers to be naked. His long blond hair is fastened in a ponytail. Elle’s honey-colored mane is perfectly unkempt, and she wears no makeup. Judging from her burnt-caramel tan, she isn’t very fond of sunscreen either.\n\nHopping out of the Fiat, the 42-year-old model exhibits a dazzling smile and genuine warmth. Although at first you can’t get over the Body—that six-foot-tall, ultra-feminine frame that can fill any woman with self-loathing—it soon disappears into the background. Before long, all you notice is how personable she is, and how comfortable she is with herself. It’s hard not to conclude that, even with her jet-setting life-style, her Riviera-tinged accent, and her multi-million-dollar lingerie company, Elle Macpherson is still just a regular Aussie beach chick at heart.\n\nElle, French financier Arpad “Arki” Busson, and their two sons, Cy and Flynn, live in London’s fashionable Notting Hill neighborhood, where Flynn, seven, attends the posh Wetherby School. There the couple runs with an illustrious crowd that includes Elizabeth Hurley, Hugh Grant and Jemima Khan, and the fashion designer Alexander McQueen. They spend winter break skiing in Saint-Moritz, and also keep a hunting estate in North Yorkshire, where they host shooting parties during the season. “I’ve shot with Arki,” says the couple’s friend Eric Fellner, whose Working Title Films has produced Notting Hill, The Interpreter, and the Bridget Jones movies. “He’s an obsessive shot and runs one of the finest, if not the finest, shoots in England, called Mulgrave.”\n\nBut the compound on this small island in the Bahamas is the family’s favorite. They can let down their guard here, among neighbors who include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg, J. Crew C.E.O. Mickey Drexler, and Lord Mountbatten’s granddaughter India Hicks.\n\nTheir Anglo-Indian-style main house, with its long balcony overlooking the ocean, has an atmosphere of lived-in luxury, with framed family photos everywhere you look. There are two guesthouses where, over Easter, Macpherson hosted CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, her husband, former assistant secretary of state Jamie Rubin, and their son, as well as duty-free heiress Marie-Chantal of Greece, her husband, Crown Prince Pavlos, and their four children. There are other cottages, too: one for staff, and another with a screening room and two giant beds for seats.\n\nMacpherson’s closet in the main house is modest, but two things stand out: her collection of straw cowboy hats (“I can’t manage to throw any out,” she says) and her vast stockpile of bikinis, which she stores in zip-lock bags and keeps organized by color.\n\nMost Americans know little about Elle Macpherson beyond what’s skin-deep. While indelible images from her heyday are imprinted in the national consciousness, the details of her life are fuzzy.\n\nThe picture has been clearer in other parts of the world. With a reported net worth of more than $50 million, Macpherson is sitting on top of an international empire. Her lingerie line, Elle Macpherson Intimates, which she launched in 1990, now does more than $70 million in sales in Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and England. This year, the brand is finally available in the U.S. and Canada. “It’s a fantastic product, and it’s well priced,” Macpherson says. “The product lives up to the name.” The Stateside launch already has the approval of some serious celebrity backers. After new mother Gwyneth Paltrow recommended the line’s nursing bra to Oprah Winfrey, the talk-show queen added her seal of approval by making a gift of the bra to 640 military wives at a group baby shower she hosted at Fort Campbell, in Kentucky.\n\nFor the most part, Macpherson owes the longevity and diversity of her career to her good choices, her common sense, her understanding of her own market value, and her ability to keep her ego in check. “I didn’t think I was good [just] because I was pretty,” she says. “I found the fashion industry very spooky. I had a very broad Australian sense of humor, and people didn’t understand me. I felt very isolated and I thought everybody was fake—‘You’re so beautiful, you’re so gorgeous.’ I would be like, ‘Fuck off.’ I think it saved me because I didn’t believe my own press from day one. I never thought I was anything special.”\n\nMacpherson branched out from magazine spreads to solo swimsuit calendars in 1991, and she followed that with a successful series of fitness videos. When she took movie roles, they were with Hugh Grant (Sirens), Anthony Hopkins (The Edge), and George Clooney (Batman & Robin). Her only foray into television was on NBC’s hit series Friends, where for six episodes she played the romantic interest of Matt LeBlanc’s Joey. And when she posed for Playboy, in 1994, the photographer was Herb Ritts; today, the spread is a collector’s item. “I just didn’t get it,” she says. “I didn’t get fashion—I didn’t know how to do it—so I made choices for myself that made financial sense.” She continues: “I was quite commercial because I was this Amazonian girl next door with a big smile and long legs, so I did television commercials and stuff that wasn’t very well respected in the fashion industry. But it made a lot of [financial] sense to me.”\n\nMacpherson is a woman accustomed to controlling her fate, and as the weekend progresses it becomes clear that she has specific ideas about how she wants to come across. She doesn’t want to be mistaken for a jet-setter. She doesn’t want me to focus on the trappings of her success. “I don’t value myself by my possessions. That’s not really me, however privileged I am. I’m concerned about being over-glamorized.... I’m very, very lucky, and you just don’t want it rubbed in people’s faces.”\n\nWhat matters most to Macpherson these days is family. She is involved in every aspect of her children’s upbringing. “We live in London,” she says. “We travel during the school holidays, like every other family who has two working parents who are capable of taking time off.” Macpherson and Busson speak mostly in French to each other, but they converse with their children in English.\n\nAmanpour, a close friend of the couple’s, describes them as generous and unpretentious. “They’re a high-profile, megawattage couple, but they also entertain their friends, and they do it in a way that is incredibly generous and fun,” she says. “Elle has this incredible sophistication, but she also has her Australian heritage. It’s a very disarming quality, and I think people are often seduced by that blend of sophistication and normalness.”\n\nArki Busson—his nickname is a cross between Arpad, which was also his step-grandfather’s name, and Floki, which is what people called his mother, Florence—comes from a wealthy French family, but he made his own fortune as a financier, founding an asset-management company called E.I.M., which handles $6 billion worth of investments worldwide. An active philanthropist, he is the chairman of Absolute Return for Kids (ARK), an international charity that funnels 100 percent of the funds it raises into aiding needy children in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Eastern Europe. He says, with typical modesty, that he found it “quite embarrassing” when the board named the charity after him while he was away on business.\n\nBusson and Macpherson met 11 years ago, at a dinner in Rome for the designer Valentino. They were both attached to others at the time, but “it started again at [the Swiss entrepreneur Jean] Pigozzi’s house in New York,” Busson says. “I think it was a Christmas party.” When I ask what struck him most about Macpherson, he pauses and chooses his words carefully. “Her eyes. Her mouth. Her smile. She has a great smile—very friendly, very natural and unaffected and fun. She looked fun. A real girl.” The onetime playboy worked hard to get as close to Macpherson as possible, and within months they were an item.\n\nBusson says he finds Macpherson’s second-act success “shocking, actually. From all the girls that are in that business—you know, from the supermodel to Über-model, or whatever you call them—she is one of the only ones that has managed to transform herself from being a cover girl to having a sustainable, long-term business.”\n\nBusson shares none of Macpherson’s qualms about their luxurious lifestyle. After all, he was born rich. “I think I continued living the life I had as a child,” he says. Macpherson, on the other hand, has had to grow into it. It’s not that her upbringing in Sydney was provincial, but to undestand who Elle Macpherson is today you have to meet Eleanor Gow.\n\nFrances Dickson was a teenager when she married Peter Gow, in the early 1960s. Their first daughter, Eleanor, was born shortly thereafter, on March 29, 1963. By the time Frances was 21, she’d had two more children, Mimi and Brendan. The family lived in a middle-class suburb of Sydney. Eleanor was quickly nicknamed Elle by Mimi, who struggled to pronounce her full name. Elle was 10 when her parents divorced, and the effect was traumatic, though she stills maintains good relationships with both. “Their divorce was very painful for both of them and for us,” she says. “People didn’t get divorced in those times.” The name Macpherson was a product of her mother’s second marriage, to a lawyer named Neill Macpherson. “I went to [a new] school, and my mother registered her [married] name, and they presumed, because people just didn’t get divorced, that we had the same name.” And so Elle Macpherson was born.\n\nAfter the divorce, Elle and her family moved in with her maternal grandmother, Nancy Dickson. Dickson ran a strict Christian household, with prayers every morning, Bible study on Wednesdays, and church on Sundays. Today, Macpherson says her morning prayers, but she admits to having taken a 20-year break. She also admits to having all the trademarks of an eldest child. (Her youngest sister, Elizabeth, was born in 1982.) “I had to be good in order to help my parents cope, so I worked really hard in school. I wasn’t particularly bright, but I did very well because I was diligent and I desperately wanted my parents’ approval and my teachers’ approval. I was one of those sorts of kids.”\n\nThat perfectionism and desire to please compelled Elle to develop marketable skills that had nothing to do with her looks. “Beauty was not something that was really cherished by the family. It wasn’t like you grew up with everyone telling you, ‘You are so beautiful.’ So choosing to do a job in the fashion industry wasn’t really where I was going.” Elle planned on attending the University of Sydney and becoming a lawyer, like her stepfather. She had modeled locally, but she never thought of it as a profession. Still, after graduating from high school, she went to New York to see if she could make some money and have an adventure. “I did go under my own steam for what I thought would be two months, and it ended up being 23 years.” Elle was 17 years old, and she never looked back.\n\nMacpherson was on a job in Tahiti when she met the French photographer Gilles Bensimon. She was 19, he was 40. They dated for two years before marrying, in 1985. Her mother disapproved, but Elle went ahead with it anyway. “He was my first love, and he so impacted my life at that time,” she says. “He formed a lot of my opinions on things. A lot of firsts were with him.” Elle became Bensimon’s muse and appeared constantly in and on the cover of the French magazine Elle, where Bensimon was the head photographer. When the American version of Elle was launched, in 1985, she quickly became synonymous with the magazine, even though she shared its name only by coincidence. (“Elle” is French for “she” or “her.”)\n\nBensimon, who is now the publication director of American Elle, readily takes responsibility for their divorce, in 1989. In his thick Gallic growl, he tells me, “She’s very warm, down to earth. She’s real. You suffer for that, and the industry was not that nice to her for many years. They were thinking she was some kind of bimbo, when she is not. She’s curious. The things she doesn’t know she learns. I can say nothing bad about her, and I know if anything happened to me I could always count on her.”\n\nMacpherson credits Bensimon with introducing her to the finer things in life. The couple divided their time between Paris and New York, and Macpherson spoke fluent French within six months of meeting him. “He taught me about art and music and literature,” she says. He also trained her palate for wine. It was a party trick of his, Macpherson recalls: they would go to Le Voltaire, in Paris, and ask the waiter to bring any bottle of wine to the table. Macpherson would taste it and identify the variety, the year, the region, and so on. “I was so desperate to impress, so I think I developed all these skills to get recognition.”\n\nSometimes Bensimon’s influence went too far, as Macpherson laughingly acknowledges. “I went for years being told that red was my best color,” she says, “because Gilles told me that: that was my color. That is not my best color. I really like white, you know. White is my favorite color. I can honestly say, ‘I’m 42 years old and white is my favorite color.’” Even today, however, Bensimon’s visual style informs her work as creative director of her own company. “Don’t forget,” she says, “I sat for many a day doing layouts for Elle magazine.”\n\nThe divorce from Bensimon left Macpherson devastated. “I was incapacitated for years,” she says. “I felt rejected in every way, shape, and form.” The partnership had defined her, both personally and professionally. “While I was working with him, I was his muse, and afterwards no one wanted to work with me anywhere. I was desperate to work with other photographers. I think it was because I wasn’t a ‘fashionable’ girl—I wasn’t fashion. What you see is what you get, and it’s been the same for 20 years, give or take a few pounds.”\n\nMacpherson was no Vogue girl, but even if the fashion world didn’t know what to do with her, there was one publication that always had a place for her: Sports Illustrated, whose annual Swimsuit Edition defied the androgynous, heroin-chic look that was all the rage, in favor of models whose bodies were healthy, curvy, and athletic. “I used to tell them, if I can see in between your legs, you are not going to model for me,” says *Sports Illustrated’*s former swimsuit editor Jule Campbell, who for 32 years selected the girls for the issue and guided its look.\n\nCampbell, who first hired Macpherson in 1984, describes one memorable setup involving sea lions. “The other girls were all afraid of them, and Elle got on her hands and knees with them and was fearless. I mean, she wanted to work and she wanted to do well, and every time I would correct her she burst out crying.” Far from discouraging her, however, the criticisms only inspired Macpherson to do better.\n\n“I told her about posing: ‘Just be natural. Be yourself,’” Campbell says. “But I was so impressed with her, because she was like a sponge. She was a very, very good learner.” Every year, Macpherson arrived showing improvement over the year before. “She would come up with a new pose,” Campbell recalls, “and I’d say, ‘You never did that before.’ And she’d say, ‘I’ve been working on it. I knew I was coming.’ I loved that in her. She didn’t stay the same. She is the ultimate professional.”\n\nMacpherson tied Christie Brinkley’s record of three consecutive swimsuit covers for S.I., in 1986, 1987, and 1988*.* “She’s a man magnet,” Campbell says. “She can do things with her eyes that no one else can do. The whites of her eyes are the whitest I’ve ever seen, and she uses them very, very well. They’re not the biggest eyes in the world, but they are gorgeous.” By 1990 she had left her modeling agency, hired manager Stuart Cameron (who’s still with her today), incorporated her name as a brand, made the cover of Time Australia, and become known around the world as “the Body.”\n\nMacpherson was still suffering from the fallout of her divorce from Bensimon when she received an interesting offer. A small New Zealand underwear company named Bendon calculated that it could break into the Australian market by hiring the country’s most famous export. Macpherson’s response was “I’m too expensive for you. But if you design a range of lingerie called Elle Macpherson Intimates, I’ll take a piece of the action.” At the time, Macpherson was modeling for Victoria’s Secret every season, and she remembers thinking, “Why am I growing somebody else’s brand when I could be growing my own? It didn’t come from a pretentious place, like ‘I’m so great,’ but it was the understanding that the public buys celebrity-driven product. I understood that very early on.”\n\nBendon agreed to Macpherson’s terms and designed a new product line around her. “I wanted to maintain a profile in Australia without being there,” she says. “I made a strategic decision to have a business relationship in Australia that kept me grounded to my home, to my country, by being visible, by having an income, by having a means to fly me back—you know, a reason to go home.” Soon Australia had its first giant “Elle” billboard, and multi-city fashion shows followed. Macpherson likens them to rock concerts: “There were thousands and thousands of people screaming.”\n\nAs the line’s exclusive model, Macpherson did not receive a fee, but she did get a percentage of the gross profit, and the lingerie was flying out of stores. In 2001, Bendon launched in the United Kingdom, and this year’s U.S. rollout coincides with its debut in the Middle East. Macpherson modeled for the campaigns herself for more than a decade, but after she turned 40, in 2003, she gave it up. Today, she is the creative director of Elle Macpherson Intimates, which now includes Afterwear, a line of at-home apparel that’s marketed under the slogan “After play, after work, after sex.”\n\n“I can’t be in front of the camera and behind the camera at the same time,” Macpherson says. “When you get to be in the position I’m in now, which is really like running a very big business, you have to delegate. That’s been a huge lesson for me to learn, and actually it’s a maturity that I’ve gained in the last two years. I don’t have to control every centimeter of everything anymore, although nothing gets done without my knowing. It’s about honoring other people and recognizing other people’s talents. I can’t take all the glory.”\n\nMacpherson was living in Los Angeles when she found out she was pregnant with Flynn. “As soon as she became pregnant, her whole focus in life changed,” says Stuart Cameron. “She started looking at houses [in London] and setting up a life and re-evaluating who she is and where she’s going.” The family now occupies a three-story, 19th-century town house, which Elle and Arki have filled with the 1930s and 40s furniture they favor. They’re also art-lovers, with a collection that ranges from black-and-white photography to works by Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst.\n\nAlthough Busson proposed to Macpherson three years ago, giving her a beautiful oblong diamond that looks to have a carat count well into the teens, they never married. When I ask them about it, I get two different responses.\n\n“I think it would be great to do it, for all the right reasons in the world,” says Busson. Macpherson demurs, offering her own, more modern interpretation. “It’s much sexier like this,” she says. “You’re my boyfriend. Isn’t that cool after 10 years? And you’re such a catch. Wouldn’t you think that somebody would just be desperate to marry him? But I think it’s really cool that I’m so secure that I don’t need that.”\n\n“I’m a catch?” asks Busson. “Well, I am now that I’m not smoking anymore.” Three months ago he quit a habit of three and a half packs a day.\n\nIndeed, both Busson and Macpherson have stopped smoking, drinking, and partying in general. After the birth of Cy, their two-year-old, Macpherson checked herself into the Meadows, a rehabilitation clinic in Wickenburg, Arizona. The seemingly drastic step sent reverberations throughout the international press; no one had ever considered Elle Macpherson a candidate for rehab. Even in the high-octane 80s, you never heard about her trashing hotel rooms or throwing tantrums.\n\nMacpherson’s explanation was that she had entered the treatment center for postpartum depression, but her motivation also appears to have something to do with her ongoing quest for control over her life. “My parents were children,” says Macpherson, “and so I was never really parented from the mature state that I’m in with my children. I’ve had to get help—outside help. My kids didn’t come with any instruction manual, but I’m proud that I didn’t give up and just say, ‘Fuck it, I’m going to have someone else raise my children because I can afford to do that.’”\n\nPerhaps the most attractive attribute Macpherson and Busson share is their willingness to admit their flaws. “We are not so compatible that life is bliss,” Macpherson says. “We both have to work at it. We have our differences, and we’ve grown.” Busson, for his part, acknowledges, “I am very imperfect.... I’m addicted to intensity. I love to do something all the time. That is my biggest challenge over the next 10 years—to work on my pace.” Macpherson’s struggle is that of many career women today: juggling business, family, and the responsibilities of everyday life. “How do I have a career, not emasculate the man I’m with, be a good parent, a good girlfriend, and good at my job, and look after myself?” she asks, clearly still trying to find the perfect balance.\n\nIn late June, that balance shifted when Elle and Arki, back in London, announced that they were separating. “We have had, and in many ways continue to have, a wonderful relationship, which has produced two beautiful children,” they said in a statement. But “we have decided to spend some time apart to consider our future.” Elle and Arki have always been unconventional, and it remains to be seen what that future will hold.\n\nAs our Bahamian weekend winds down, Macpherson and I sit on the front patio and watch as Busson and Flynn negotiate the details of an afternoon fishing trip. I ask if she’s surprised by the path her life has taken—the swimsuit modeling, the underwear empire, the two powerful men, the two beautiful boys. She pauses to consider all this, then says, “I think there is an immature side of me—or maybe it’s sort of the low-self-esteem side of me—that has never owned my life. Really owned it. Like ‘O.K., this is what I do. This is how I got there.’ Because it’s almost too scary to say it. But I’ve had a 23-year career. I’ve got a great family. I’m 42 years old. And I’m at the peak of my career.”"
