TATLER SEPTEMBER 2015 55 TATIER ROBERT CRAMPTON Robert on the mysteries of the male libido (page 176) What's your worst habits Excessive swearing.

Invisibility - for reasons I’m honestly not at all proud of. EMMA BEAUMONT Tatler’s acting online assistant films this month’s covergirl forTatler.com What's your favourite joke? I used to work in a shoe-recycling factory - it was sole-destroying. What's your signature dance move? Courtney Love-style headbanging. Which super-power would you most like to have?

To be able to control people’s minds. That’s evil, isn’t it? What's your signature dance move? Something between belly dancing and stomping. What's your worst habit? Bad time-management.

DAVID ABRAHAMS David snaps a few nice knockers for our jewellery story (page 81) What's your earliest memory? up and down on the sofa while singing along to Prince’s ‘The Most Beautiful Girl in the World’. What would be your death-row meal? My mum’s roast lamb with homemade Yorkshire gravy. The word you overuse most? Antidisestablishmentarianism - it comes up all the time. GERALD SCARFE Gerald illustrates the formerly mustachioed Tory MP Keith Simpson (page 103) Which super-power would you most like to have? Omnipotence - it might come in handy. What never fails to make you Answering daft questions. What's your go-to fancy-dress costume? I once went as David Hockney, with a blonde wig. What's your favourite joke? I forget.

Anything that allows for wings, a wand and a whopping great ballgown. Which super-power would you most like to have? To be able to turn Maltesers into jewels. What's your worst habit? Leaving a trail of half-drunk cups of Earl Grey behind me. 58 TATLER SEPTEMBER 2015 \\s SASSOON S A L O N I S T\"” DIMENSIONAL COLOUR THAT RIVALS THE SALON TREATS ROOTS THEN LENGTHS SEPARATELY AS DONE IN SALONS , ★★★★★ RATED FOR GREY COVERAGE & SHINE* *HOST COMMON RATING AMONG 531 WOMEN ON Supers^iwy'^ e co.uft'-2V^/201S.

K What was your first erotic experience? a With a person of the same sex at school. Except it wasn’t really about sex. It was about a meeting of minds and an inbuilt understanding of gender fluidity, b With the family gardener. Under a willow tree. Intense Lac/y C/jaffer/ey vibes, c With a train-tracked Etonian. But his name was Tarka. Do any of your relations have any of the following names? a River/Shanti/Bodhi/Chakra. b Merlin/Florian/Sienna/Delilah. c Oscar/Wilf/Rose/Nell. What time do your children go to bed? a Clocks are so restrictive. We make our own time in this house, b When they’re tired, c Our nanny is wonderful, what a godsend (ie, no idea, that’s totally her remit). What’s your job? a I make spiral mazes out of living materials, like grass and snails, but I wouldn’t call that a job. b I have a second-hand bookshop in Chelsea. O Second-hand as in vintage. And I create art. A lot of sculpture, c I am a QC, but I do loads of yoga. At your own birthday party, do you: a Not turn up. b Turn up high, c Turn up early, with three minicabs booked for midnight, 1 and 2am. Just so you can go with the flow Where were you brought up? a In Marrakesh, where I learned how to charm snakes and steal from tourists, b The Bahamas, where my father lived with his third wife and her five children, and Ibiza, where my mother lived with her 22-year-old boyfriend, Pablo, who didn’t speak any English. c Lincolnshire and Scotland, where I ran feral on my grandparents’ estate, learning how to kill rabbits. What do you wear to parent- teacher evening? a A hooded cape. Or a turban - one that I bind myself, as taught to me by my ayah, b A gilet, peasant skirt and coiny belt - as long as people can see the dolphin tattoo on my left shoulder. The one I got in the Solomon Islands when I was stoned, c Work clothes. With a really fun necklace. Something a bit mad. You are offered a villa in Ibiza for a month over the summer. Do you: a Refuse when you find out it has running water T. and electricity. You ; prefer a large tent on the beach, complete with Persian rugs and a hand-wound record player, b Look confused. You always summer in Ibiza. You’re part of the Ibiza crowd. Everyone knows you. It’s your thing (what’s happening here??), c Mrs dases de espanol van a ser muy utiles. Clare Bennett ANSWERS Mostly A: Yes, you win, but my goodness it must be exhausting being you. Mostly B: You’re not bohemian, you’re just the same as everyone else. But that’s not so bad. Fancy a trip to Wilde Ones on the King’s Road? Mostly C: You are about as bohemian as Peter Jones. Never mind.

The girl seems to be on one long holiday - but all in the name of research. A former fashion PR and creative director of Berlin’s The Store (a Vinyl Factory and Soho House collaboration), Alex is busy assembling an edit of things found around the world’ for her eponymous Walton Street shop, a curated home’, as she calls it. In the three-storey Chelsea townhouse you’ll find Cecil Beaton prints on the wall, Nina Simone on the record player, clothes, furniture, books, linen - a whole freaking lifestyle for sale. And Alex herself, making lattes and seducing everyone with her husky voice. The former More House girl used to dress her younger brother Harry in girls’ clothes in the family’s Chiswick home (her father Robert is a documentary-maker turned fine-art specialist); now the 32-year-old has also created a fashion line inspired by Amelia Earhart. When not flying around the world, Alex can be found in the Soho loft she shares with her boyfriend. Vinyl Factory founder Mark Wadhwa, drinking wheatgrass-and-vodka cocktails.

DUNGAREES Every woman harbours a secret desire to wear a pair of dungarees. Its a bit like wearing your boyfriend s shirt - sometimes better in theory than in practice. We picture ourselves, adorable and intensely attractive in our dungarees, doing a bit of light DIY with our lover. Perhaps with a darling little smudge of paint on the end of our nose. And then most of us, wisely, let that little fantasy go the way of all fantasies. Dungarees are the Fifty Shades of Fashion. But here’s the thing: dungarees have stepped out of fetish and onto frontline. And they come in all shapes and sizes, and hues and arrangements, so it’s just got a whole lot easier to wear them without looking like a dick. Or fat. What they’re not is baggy, cutesy or coy. These are - never thought I’d type the following, so I’m going to shout it - POWER DUNGAREES. These are not dungarees to bucolically gather the roses in. These are dungarees that mean business. Wear them with anything - but not a jacket, as that looks a bit three-piece silly. Best bet is a fiat shoe and a pretty blouse. That ferns things up a bit. But power away in a polo neck if you’re game. There are flares and tapered. There are sailor-button details and florals. There is snakeskin and denim. It’s the Day of the Dungaree.

Because it is not shy and retiring, is it? It s not subtle or muted or low-key. It’s the print equivalent of standing on a chair and shouting: ‘I’M HERE! GUYS! I’M HERE! HAVE YOU SEEN ME YET? ’COS I’M HERE!’ So even though it’s modern in terms of visual decibels, it is rather retro in its fiockiness. Its blowsiness. Its overblown, front-room, what-will-the-neighbours-think, chuck-those-car-keys- in-a-bowl, sheer bloody nuttiness. And yet genteel too. Weird. AR PHOTOGRAPH: BERT STERN/CONDE NAST ARCHIVE.

Big news. Yes, there’s a nod to Forties tailoring - belted jackets for a waspy waist - but there are also Sixties cropped trousers and peacoats and some really rather far-out slashed kilts and shredded tassel effects.

Sam is the brother of Guy - Prince William and Harry’s mate - but he’s radically different from his clubbable^ little brother. The dens of Chelsea are not for Sam. You are more likely to find this charming, bearded photographer dancing on the kitchen table in his Andalusian farmhouse with. his three young daughters, Melo, 1 0, Leila, five, and Juno, fotfr. Or camping under the stars fn Mexico. Or photographing the slums in Guatemala. Sam, 4 1 , has never felt at ease arnong the Establishment. He grew up in Wiltshire and was sent to boarding school aged eight, first to » Wellesley House and then to Stowe. ‘I never responded very well at school, I was never academic. Everyone was slightly pigeonholed and I became angry with the whole system.’ So, after Stowe, Sam went travelling. Interrailing through Europe first, then venturing further, to India and the Far East. And it was there that photography grabbed him. ‘The cameraVas always a tool to get nie into 'other worlds^ to show that there wasn’t just this privileged, English world. And then the camera changed from being this place for me to hide behind ■ into my career.’ ■ . ' , \\ ’ These days, Sam mostly mixes commercial work with private commissions - ‘for celebrities-slash-oligarchs’, lie jokes. High-end portraiture, in other words. He recently shot Benedict Cumberbatchs ' wedding because the actors wife, Sophie, is a friend. « If you want to commission Sam, you just need to tempt him over from Spain; he moved there last year with his wife, Susie, a craniosacral therapist in training, and their daughters to a house on a mountain from where they can see Africa on a clear day. ‘We had this wonderful * life in Wiltshire and we just said, “Really? We’re going to settle into ‘ this? No,” we thought, “how else can we do this?”’ SM-C TATLER SEI^TEMBER 2015 93 Super Spenders Poet Stephen Spender had a voracious fkxi-sexual appetite and was fiiends with the 20th century’s cleverest bohemians — now his son, Matthew Spender, has written a hook about Rowing up with this fast-living set Matthew Bell meets the sculptor in his Tuscan idyll Photographed by LUCA CAMPRI PHOTOGRAPHS: THE LIZZIE AND MATTHEW SPENDER COLLECTION, NATASHA GORKY T his is an incredibly indiscreet book,’ says Matthew Spender, sucking on his umpteenth cigarette of the morning. We are in the piazza in Asciano, a small town in Tuscany half an hour’s drive from his home in San Sano. Matthew is usually described as a sculptor or a painter, or as the son of the poet Sir Stephen Spender. But he is also a talented writer and has just completed his third book, A House in St Johns Wood. It is the first truly frank biography of his father, a passionate and politically minded poet and activist of the mid-20th century whose reputation was fiercely guarded by his wife. Lady Spender, until she died nearly five years ago. Matthew began writing it within days of her death and describes it as a nip-in-the-bud kind of book’, covering all the scandalous stuff before anyone else can. Because apart from being a poet and an intellectual, Stephen Spender was at the intersection of all the most fascinating social circles of the last century. He was a friend of WH Auden and Christopher Isherwood, and the three writers became so thick with each other in the Thirties that Evelyn Waugh griped they had ganged up and captured the decade for themselves’. He hung out with Allen Ginsberg, raised money for a 1 9-year- old Dylan Thomas and counted TS Eliot, WB Yeats, Raymond Chandler and Jean-Paul Sartre among his friends. He was also a promiscuous homosexual. Who cares, you might say, that he was romping around with men - but this was well before it was decriminalised and after his second marriage, to Natasha Litvin, a concert pianist of Lithuanian-Jewish descent. She preferred to keep up appearances, although the truth, as everyone else could see, was different. An Italian would never write a book like this,’ says Clockwise, from top left, sculptures by Matthew Spender; his parents, Natasha and Stephen, 1941; Matthew with his wife Maro, 1963; as a child with his father in Italy, 1951. Opposite page, Matthew at his studio, 2015 Matthew. ‘Nobody here would ever start talking about their parents’ sex life after their death. The English are happy to let everything rip, whereas when someone dies here, they are surrounded with a kind of halo.’ The curious thing about Matthew, 70, is that he doesn’t seem bothered by his father’s infidelities — he’s more angry with his mother for being such a Hyacinth Bucket. He portrays her as a snob, a woman who, when her husband confessed to all his affairs early on, simply said, ‘Now we can turn the page.’ She wrote a memoir, but Matthew says it is unreadable, because it is simply a litany of names and any emotional issue is dealt with in just a few sentences. ‘Mum enjoyed being Lady Spender and was good at it,’ he says. She and Matthew’s wife Maro never hit it off. Maro’s idea of a conversation, says Matthew, is to lob a controversial statement into the air and wait for the fallout. Among other expats in Italy, she has a reputation for being forthright. He recalls asking her to switch off her instinct for contradiction when they went to visit his parents. ‘I can’t,’ she said. ‘Conversation is supposed to be a ping-pong. But with your parents it’s all ping and no pong.’ Matthew met Maro Gorky, 72, the eldest daughter of the Armenian-American artist Bertoluccis Stealing Beauty was inspired by Matthew and Maro’s life in Tuscany Arshile Gorky and a painter herself, as a teenager and has lived with her ever since. They moved to Italy in 1968 and by all appearances are living the Chiantishire dream — beautiful house, plenty of good food and wine, a vivacious social life. Except they don’t hang out with Britons. ‘I loathed Tony Lambton,’ he says, referring to the late Lord Lambton, who lived in dog-eared splendour at Villa Cetinale until 2006. ‘We had one or two absolutely disastrous lunches and then agreed never to see each other again.’ Like Lambton, who was fleeing a scandal, Matthew came to Italy in self-imposed exile. ‘My background is extremely complicated,’ he says. ‘I needed to get away. I didn’t expect to stay for 45 years. But children are born and you start working and it’s very difficult to leave afterwards.’ Maro was perhaps also escaping her parents: her mother was the Boston-born beauty and painter Agnes Magruder, nicknamed ‘Mougouch’ (‘little mighty one’ in Armenian) by Gorky; Agnes’s father was an American naval attache, so Agnes was educated in Washington, The Hague and Switzerland, and got into communism while in Shanghai. Aged 16, she was, according to Hannah Rothschild, caught in flagrante delicto with a sailor and ‘packed off to America in disgrace with 1 00 dollars and a suitcase full of ballgowns’. She ended up in New York as a typist for the communist magazine China Today, then met Gorky at a party given by Willem de Kooning, the Dutch-American abstract expressionist. Matthew and Maro’s farmhouse is the culmination of their rich artistic heritage, a visual orgy that has been likened to Gharleston, the home of Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell and nexus of the Bloomsbury Set, with its handpainted furniture and frescoed walls. ^ About Town TATLER SEPTEMBER 2015 95 Frori^eft, WH Auden, Steph( Spender and 3 ottom^ Mattnpv’s pf Humphries^Sc Christopher Isherwood, 1931] Li^zie^ with her hushand, Bai About Town sister. <1 Bernardo Bertolucci s 1 996 film Stealing Beauty was inspired by their life in Tuscany - Bertolucci is a friend and Maro was at school with Bertolucci s wife, Clare Peploe. The film tells the story of an American teenager, played by Liv Tyler, who stays at the Tuscan home of a sculptor and friend of her late mother, a poet. Although the plot was not based on real events, the films vibe clearly reflected the bohemianism of the Spender-Gorky household. Their life there was also the subject of Matthews first book. Within Tuscany , while his second, published in 2001, was a biography of Arshile Gorky. ‘That’s it for writing books,’ he says. ‘Those are the three I’ve got in me.’ The creative impulse has been inherited by Matthew’s daughters, Saskia, 45, and Cosima, 43: Saskia, who is based in London, describes herself as ‘an artist who works on the home’ and Cosima is a documentary-maker - she made a film about her grandmother and has just finished another about the Palio horse race in Siena. Matthew’s sister Lizzie is married to Barry Humphries (they married in 1990; she’s his fourth wife), and there is a sense that the Spenders are bohemian royalty, inhabiting a world in which everyone is an artist or related to each other. There’s a moment in the book when Matthew describes a conversation with Mougouch, in which her social world and his parents’ seem to overlap with dizzying effect - Mougouch had casually remarked she knew that Encounter^ the magazine Stephen Spender founded and edited, was funded by the CIA. ‘This was what Maro and I used to call a “short circuit”, meaning one of those moments when her world and my world turned out to be too intimately connected.’ They have always resisted getting caught up in a social vortex, here and in Italy. ‘It always made me uncomfortable,’ he writes. ‘I didn’t want us all to be riding along in the same machine.’ Matthew says there is an annoying tendency to define people by one thing they do, whereas he enjoys painting, writing and sculpting in equal measure. He certainly writes well, and the book is full of juicy material, not surprising given his father’s flirtations with so many worlds. Stephen Spender was born in 1909 and had a bourgeois upbringing in Hampstead. As a young man he was liberated, writes Matthew, by his friend WH Auden’s ‘extraordinary matter-of-factness about sex’, so at Oxford, and then in Berlin in the Thirties, Spender led a promiscuous, guilt-free life. It seems that Auden took Spender’s virginity, but what of Isherwood? ‘I don’t think he and Christopher had an affair,’ says Matthew, ‘but they shared lovers and had a tremendously male homosexual world in Berlin.’ In fact. Spender was bisexual, or omnisexual. As he put it in a letter to Isherwood in 1934: ‘I find boys much more attractive, in fact I am rather more than usually susceptible, but actually I find the actual sexual act with women more satisfactory, more terrible, more disgusting and, in fact, more everything.’ Recently, Matthew and Lizzie consigned for sale at auction a cache of flirtatious letters between Stephen and a teenage Lucian Freud, written between 1939 and 1941, which some say suggests an affair. His love life was complicated: in 1933, he fell in love with Tony Hyndman and they lived together from 1935 to 1 936, when he met Inez Pearn, whom he then married. At one stage, all three were living together, although the marriage collapsed in 1939, and by 1941, when he married Natasha Litvin, he was seeking a more conventional domestic arrangement. Matthew describes his father as ‘a very good conversationalist with immaculate manners, who told very good stories’. But he was detached from the social life he created; he was slightly Establishment and yet very much not. Matthew recalls being taken to his club for lunch when he was 12, and precociously saying to his father: ‘I don’t really see why you’re in a club like this. You don’t seem to have anything in common with these people... I can’t see that you have anything in common with anybody.’ Was he aware that Stephen was different to other fathers? ‘Yes. Children know everything,’ he says. Even about sex? ‘You don’t understand sex, but you know that sex is there as part of the equation. Children can handle it as long as the house is there, as long as Mummy loves Daddy and the house is a stable environment. I was always aware that Dad’s life was ambiguous.’ Out of loyalty to his mother, he resisted his father’s attempts to make an ally of him. And he wasn’t entirely comfortable with the homosexual world. When his father, lamenting the death from AIDS of his lover Bryan Obst, remarked that the disease was the worst thing to have happened in his lifetime, Matthew snapped back: ‘Worse than the concentration camps? Worse than the Second World War?’ Stephen replied: ‘Yes. Because AIDS stops people from doing what they like with their bodies, and that freedom is the first of all freedoms.’ But Matthew respects his father’s position, and saves his disapproval for his mother. When John Sutherland, critic and emeritus professor of English at University College London, wrote a biography of Spender in 2004, she would sit next to him as he went through archives. ‘And if she saw John reading a compromising letter, she’d take it from him and say, “I don’t think we have to worry about that.’” She even took a cut of his commission, he says. ‘How dare she!’ For all the bohemianism, Matthew Spender’s love life, and presumably his sex life, have been refreshingly simple. He has been married to one woman for over 50 years. ‘The one-night stand for me is out,’ he writes. ‘It’s permanence or bust.’ For Maro’s part, her fidelity is based on a rejection of the chaos in which she grew up, caused by her mother’s love affairs. They are the Saffys to their Edina and Patsy mothers and fathers. Their parents’ worlds may have been more glamorous, more daring, more extraordinary. But they have achieved what previous generations of bohemians never did - making good art without shagging everyone they know. □ A House in St Johns Wood is published by William Collins at £25 on 27 August.

The Mitfords, the Middletons, the Delevingnes. There’s something about multiple brilliance that makes our heads spin. The latest sister act to take society by storm are the Packards, Tessa and Antonia, two foxy and fabulous girls in their 20s. Like the Middletons, they went to Marlborough and are blessed with masses of swishy dark hair and ice-cream-smooth complexions. And the comparisons don’t stop there - one of them, Antonia, has recently caught the eye of a royal. Prince Harry, which is quite a departure for the man who prefers blondes. However, it is not hard to see what attracted Prince Hal... If you get the chance to meet Tessa or Antonia, you will, in the time it takes them to smoke a Camel Blue, understand why they are the most mesmerising duo in London right now. For one thing, there’s the lineage. Their mother, Duke, is a smoking-hot Brazilian, which elevates them into a whole new league of Sloane beauty. Perhaps it’s this South American blood that also makes them so attractive - there’s something fresh and unstuflfy about these two. Smoking is something Tessa does a lot of, as well as laughing, and talking, and making big plans for the future. They both have Atlantic reserves of energy, Tessa throwing herself into jewellery design, Antonia running her very own charity. The bad news is that Tessa has been snapped up. I’m sorry to report that she got married in 2012, to Henry Reid, a financier of Suffolk farming stock. They are currently camping out at Tessa’s mother’s house in Belgravia while their marital home gets done up. But then there’s Antonia. Mysterious, wild, free-spirited Antonia. She is not married, but good luck seducing her. The competition is pretty stiff. So what do you need to know? First off, the ancestry. Their great-grandfather (their father’s mother’s father) was J Arthur Rank, the film producer who co-founded Pinewood Studios and later the Rank Organisation, which owned 619 cinemas in 1942. So there was money and glamour, but also philanthropy - Lord Rank (as he became) was a staunch Methodist and set up the Rank Foundation, dedicated to his many charitable interests. He had two daughters, the eldest of whom, Shelagh, married Fred M Packard, a lieutenant in the US Army Signal Corps. Still with us? Good. Their son Fred went to Marlborough and became a money whizz, creating a whole new fortune of his own by co-founding the Brazilian investment trust Garantia, which was eventually sold to Credit Suisse, and later helping to set up the Latin American arm of Black Rock, the investment titan. He married Duke and they had homes in Belgravia and Brazil. Like his grandfather, he was a major philanthropist until he suddenly died of a stroke one morning in 2009, aged 60. ^8 TATLER SEPTEMBER 2015 PHOTOGRAPHS: TESSA PACKARD/INSTAGRAM, GETTY IMAGES, MARCUS DAWES, STYLE STREETSTALKER, REX FEATURES, HUGO BURNAND, SHUTTERSTOCK Tessa in Scotland with her friend Milla Stafford-Deitsch FIFTY SHADES OF HARRY* Prince Harry’s romantic journey from light to dark. Hair, that is WASP blonde Mermaid blonde This means that Tessa and Antonia are heirs not just to two enormous fortunes but also to a desire to give a lot away. Antonia has set up her own charity the Sara Charlton Foundation, which helps victims of domestic abuse. Tessa is a tireless fundraiser, and she and Antonia have established the Young Marlburian Foundation, which aims to encourage past and present pupils of the school to raise money for those less fortunate than themselves. They are also on the committee of the Rank Fellowship, founded by their father in 2003 to help nurture young leaders. ‘Charity for my father was not just about writing cheques,’ says Tessa. ‘He took an interest in everything he did.’ They both excelled at Marlborough and went on to Edinburgh, where Tessa read fine art and history of art, and Antonia read Spanish, landing a first. Tessa’s starter job was at London art dealers Dickinson, where she worked for four years, creating a Latin American division. She left in 2013 to launch her own jewellery- design firm, Tessa Packard London. Her pieces are bold, bright and playful - classical, but with a bounce in their step. A bit like the Packards themselves. She has launched lines influenced by exotic fabrics, Mexico and the opium dens of 19th-century China. Every June, she gives a big summer dinner to thank everyone who has helped her out — guests at this year’s gathering, held at Belvedere in Holland Park, included Astrid Harbord, Guy and Lizzy Pelly, and JJ Jardine-Paterson. When Tessa ting-tinged her glass to give a speech, it shattered. Wow. Weekends for Tessa are spent in Suffolk, although the sisters also meet up in Scotland, where their parents bought a large estate on the east coast. There have always been animals in their lives: ponies, horses, hamsters, guinea pigs. But a recent addition to the Packards’ lives are dogs: Tessa has a miniature wire-haired dachshund called Smartie, and her mother, Duke, has Smartie’s daughter. They never had dogs when their father was alive, but now they are utterly obsessed. ‘I recently AQA’d how many miniature wire-haired dachshunds it would take to pull me on a sleigh,’ says Tessa. ‘The answer was 15.’ Antonia, meanwhile, has ploughed a worthy furrow, first going into investigative journalism - she worked for independent TV production company CTVC - before setting up her charity. But she also knows how to have fun — an auction that she organised in 2013 raised £230,000, the competition being aided by an inter-sister bidding war for an Emi Miyashita drawing of anatomical parts. The Packards’ friendship circle overlaps with those of the young royals, so think Eugenie and Beatrice, Ruck Keenes, van Straubenzees, Guy Pelly and, of course. Prince Harry. Not that you will ever hear a word about that. Apart from good looks, fun and lineage, nothing is more attractive to a prince than discretion. □ Modern blonde Media bronde Dalek brown Brazilian brown *OK, WE KNOW IT’S ONLY EIGHT JXFAM'S ONLINE SHOP About Town Notes t@ self What’s not to W about emoji slippers? By Gavanndra Hodge andAiha Miller he human species communicates in so many ways. Verbally, and not just with words but also with squeaks, shrieks, grunts, growls and sometimes tuts and the tremendously evocative raspberry. We use our eyes, narrowing crossly, widening them in - real or feigned - surprise, closing them when we want people to know that we fancy a nap. We can communicate using the medium of dance, which is very effective when hunting for a potential mate - less so when ordering in a restaurant. But never have we used the velvet slipper as a means of communication. Until now. Sociologists and anthropologists, take note. These emoji slippers may look traditional from afar, but they represent a turning point in the history of humanity.

By Emma Kennedy W ay back in the mists of time, when everyone genuinely believed Angel Delight was delicious and freeze-dried potato was somehow a good thing, there was a board game called Totopoly and it was magnificent. You may know it. You had to train horses, then race them like billy-o. It was frantic and, for some reason, a horse called Marmaduke Jinks won every single time we played, whoever was training him. It was like voodoo. Well, now there’s something similar, except, instead of horses, it’s the even-toed ungulate du jour, the camel. Don’t turn your nose up. I was driving in Hertfordshire recently and saw a ruddy great sign strapped to a tree. ‘CAMEL RACING,’ it yelled. This is now officially a thing, people, and it’s already in Hertfordshire. So accept it. Camel Up is a cracking board game. There are five camels, five coloured dice and you have to bet like fury as they make their way round the desert tiles. You bet on each leg, then bet for the overall winner. But know this - you can try to be clever and throw in an oasis or a mirage to gain an advantage, but here’s the thing: it’s like a REAL race. You may think you’ve picked the camel that’s ahead, but five minutes later, you’re all head in hands, wailing because your game plan is lying in tatters. It’s super.

By Fiona McKenzie Johnston W hat is the correct way to celebrate a six-year-old’s birthday? A local church hall, a Frozen theme, paper plates on which crumbly sausage rolls mingle with fairy cakes and Quavers and no one touches the hummus and carrot sticks? That is one way, certainly, but in a few rarefled pockets of London things are done differently. There are private fairgrounds, there are petting zoos, there are iPods in the party bags. Some are whispering that the whole notion of the children’s birthday party has got out of control, that they have become yet another arena in which wildly competitive ultra-high- net-worth individuals might vaunt their largesse. But we are not here to judge, we are only here to report... Enfants, have found themselves working with budgets for under- 10s of up to £150,000. This is a peculiarly London trend and may be down to the more international nature of the capital. As one seven-year-old from Kensington points out: ‘Europeans and Americans give the best parties.’ But the English are joining the fun too, because no one wants their child to become famous for throwing the worst parties in the class. And so save-the-dates are sent out at the beginning of term in September — to prevent event clash. Master bakers need to be consulted early about a unique, multi-tiered creation. ‘The cake really matters,’ insists a Holland Park seven-year-old. ‘Mine always comes from Peggy Porschen.’ In addition to cake, the catered food is expected to be nutritiously balanced, organic and free range. Ottolenghi is popular. Polled parents agreed that they were more likely to come to a party if it was being catered. Sending the nanny is thought to be both ‘unspeakably rude’ and a snub. A party that took over an entire Hammersmith theatre to watch a rave-reviewed musical unsurprisingly benefited from almost 100 per cent parental attendance. And at one recent party at the Dorchester, there were three separate anterooms: one for parents, one for European nannies, another for Filipina nannies. In the meantime, a young, pretty and slightly scruffy mother got mistaken for the au pair at a party in a Holland Park mansion, and spent the duration corralled into HOW TO TELL IF YOU ARE AT A MINI SUPER-PARTY 102 TATLER SEPTEMBER 2015 PHOTOGRAPHS: DON HONEYMAN/CONDE NAST ARCHIVE, ISTOCK shepherding children from one activity to the next. Many parents dream of the day their sprog turns six - the golden cut-off age — when children can be dropped off at parties and other parents no longer need to be entertained: ‘God, its going to be a relief’ is the consensus. But the next stage brings its own issues, not least the change in expectations when it comes to entertainment. Bespoke, if you please, whether that means a Bond party with a helicopter ride, a staged kidnapping and RIBs racing up and down the Thames - or a two-day, three-location St Trinian’s-themed affair with professional actors and actresses employed as schoolmasters and schoolmistresses. One American mother organised a weekend with a TV production company, during which the 10-year-olds wrote, filmed and starred in their own mini feature films. Slightly more low-key are invitations to houses in the country - though it seems less low-key when you discover that Sharky & George are providing two days of entertainment. And what if the house concerned isn’t actually in this country? Ten seven-year- old boys were recently Netjetted to the Alps for a couple of days’ skiing by some Ganadian parents. Rumours abound of present lists, although no one will confirm it. Many a rookie has left a party with the realisation that their going-home present is worth considerably more than anything they may have dropped off The acceptable minimum for a party gift hovers at around £40, but can easily go up to £100 for the mother of a reception child keen to ensure continuing invitations — ‘I just wanted to make sure she made friends.’ Of course, there are still plenty of parents who organise soft play (if Bramley’s in North Kensington is good enough for Blue Ivy Garter...) or paintballing or the cinema simply because that’s what their child would most like - though they do tend to book the whole of the Electric. □ - r ^ r ^ r : zn rjza zza r zn - ZSl z za r ^ r ^ I ZQ z ^ -30 ZZG KEITH SIMPSON The veteran Tory MP who trashed his trademark tache W ho killed Cock Robin? And - hey! - who stole Keith Simpson’s moustache? Simpson is the barrel-chested, suede-shoed, kerchief- parping Rt Hon Member for a swampy part of mid-Norfolk known as the Broadland constituency. Until recently, he sported, in addition to his large, round spectacles, a wide moustache. Pure Groucho Marx. A few months ago, the moustache disappeared. Victim of another ‘swingeing Tory cut’? Well, yes, in a sense. One morning, Simpson was at his bathroom mirror, doing a bit of edging work on that tache (any gardener will know what a chore this sort of thing is), when his hand slipped. Whoaa! Before he knew it, he had accidently razored away one end of the old bristler. There were two options: trim the other end to match and end up looking like Adolf Hitler, or mow off the thing in its entirety. He opted for the latter. The Commons went into mourning for days. ‘Commander Keith’ is a Westminster legend. At first glance, you might suspect he is a Blimpish fogey, one of those militaristic shire Tories that faded with (his political lodestar) Harold Macmillan. Yet, up close, Simpson is twinkly, clement, clued-up, terrific fun. With several military history books to his name, he is clever too. Born in Norwich in 1949, he was reared in what he describes as ‘the non-commissioned officer class’ (his father was a cost clerk, his mother a typist). His maternal grandmother, a Margaret Rutherford lookalike, was a stalwart of the local Conservatives and, in the 1959 general election, young Keith toured East Anglia in the back of her Morris Minor, helping to stuff Tory leaflets through letter boxes. School was a Norfolk grammar. He read history at the University of Hull and threw himself into Conservative national student politics. Hull was a hotbed of trendy socialism but Simpson relished being unfashionable. After postgrad research at King’s College London, he taught military history and defence studies at Sandhurst. Students who slept through his (actually scintillating) lectures included the future King Abdullah II ^ of Jordan and several of today’s British ^ Army top brass. In Mrs Thatcher’s third term, he became a Ministry of Defence special adviser. He made it to the Commons in 1997 and, after a front-bench stint in Opposition, would have become a minister in 2010 had David Cameron won alone. Coalition compromises put paid to that, and Simpson became William Hague’s parliamentary private secretary. Earlier this year, he became a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee and, with it, a privy councillor. Simpson, whose wife Pepi was a regular in the Women’s Royal Army Corps (salutes all round at bedtime), was a guest on the infamous Channel 4 After Dark programme when the late Oliver Reed was so spectacularly stocious with drink. Watch it on YouTube and you’ll spot a youthful K Simpson doing his best to keep a straight face as dipso Oily goes over the edge. This loyal, decent One Nation Tory has seen the party float back to him philosophically. Simpson is unofficial colonel-in-chief of the Tory backbenchers’ ‘Breakfast Club’, who assemble most days for fried bread, snorkers and gossip. He gets his kicks out of watching the foibles of younger creatures and that cross little bantam. Speaker Bercow. In the Commons, Simpson sits at the very back in the far right corner, bubbling with merriment, always the historian, observing, noting and drawing shrewd conclusions that will last a lot longer than the thrusters who briefly stand in the limelight he himself will never occupy.

By Sebastian Shakespeare ARCADIA BRITANNICA BY HENRY BOURNE (Thames & Hudson, £18.95) There are some glorious British summer traditions that never change. The Glastonbury mud bath. The flash of oars and clash of lurid blazers at the Henley Royal Regatta. Straw^berries and cream at Wimbledon. The annual cheese-rolling competition in Stilton, Cambridgeshire... But true English folklore has for too long been the embarrassing relative in our seasonal calendar, evoking mocking, scorned images of morris dancers with blacked-up faces. Refreshingly, this book is a vibrant and defiant celebration of the British folklore scene and shows that it has a rich cultural history rooted in Celtic myths and early Christian rites. Within its pages are stunning photographs of witches, coconut dancers, straw men and pearly kings and queens, taken at some of the 700 folkloric events that occur around the country. Bourne has done us proud - he’s produced a spectacular visual portrait of Britain at its most eccentric. In essence, as an introductory essay explains, this Jerusalem-like activity is all about diversity, good-natured revelry and dressing up - and, oh, how we Brits love to dress up. Folk festivals are at once great entertainment and a link with our past. Blacking up, for instance, far from being an example of crude racial stereotyping, was an effective form of disguise, often employed when the performers should have been working, not dancing and drinking. Cheers to that. All festive life is here. fn^r niw Irt,! h, HAIRCUTS OF HACKNEY BY DANIEL FROST (Hoxton Mini Press, £12.95) Moptop, hi-top, man bun, comb- over, duck’s arse... Daniel Frost’s paintings of the backs of Hackney heads are a visual record of the weird and wayward haircuts you’ll find in east London, the epicentre of self-expression and coiffed confldence. His fold-out book captures London’s myriad personalities in a few simple strokes. What larks among the locks! Get ye to the hairdresser! CIRCLING THE SUN BY PAULA McLAIN (Virago, £14.99) The author of The Paris Wife, a bestseller written in the voice of Ernest Hemingway’s first wife, takes on another real-life character for her latest novel. This is McLain’s imagined story of Beryl Markham, a daredevil aviator and member of Kenya’s Happy Valley set who became tangled in a love triangle with Karen Blixen and big-game hunter Denys Finch Hatton. McLain brings the scandalous past to vivid life. BARBARA THE SLUT AND OTHER PEOPLE BY LAUREN HOLMES (Fourth Estate, £12.99) A fresh and darkly funny debut collection of short stories about family, friends and lovers. Holmes has an enviable lightness of touch combined with a bracing honesty. A law-school grad takes a job selling sex toys, a woman prefers the company of her pit bull to that of her foreign lover and, in the title story, Barbara navigates her high school’s poisonous, slut- shaming culture. Sassy and savvy. PILLOW MAN BY NICK COLEMAN (Cape, £17.99) This must be the first time in fiction where the pillow talk precedes the love affair. Toiling amid the Egyptian-cotton sheets and goose-down pillows of an Oxford Street department store, our shop-assistant hero chats up a female customer and a relationship blossoms. But in an intriguing twist, it transpires the pair have already met before. A quirky, well-written romance cum mystery tale. □ 104 TATLER SEPTEMBER 2015 STILL-LIFES: JODY TODD PHOTOGRAPHS: JOHN WATERS COURTESY OF SPRUTH MAGERS/MARIANNE BOESKY GALLERY, NY Art for sale Deep purple, little ponies and wiping out with John Waters.

TATLER SEPTEMBER 2015 IO 5 About Town Restaurants B It's one hell of a ride at this Newbury newbie, says Jeremy Wayne A funny old place is Newbury. Good for racing but a bit of a lottery in the restaurant stakes. At the high end, there’s the Vineyard at Stockcross, Classic FM founder Sir Peter Michael’s fancy-pants hotel, with its dancing fountains and wine list longer than both your arms (and legs). At the lower end, pubs aplenty, some all right and some a bit Arthur Daley. But there’s nothing much in the middle. So when ex- Vineyard, ex-Coworth Park chef John Campbell opened his new restaurant the Woodspeen at the end of last year, it gave locals and not-so-locals something to cheer about. ‘Jack’s back,’ they said gleefully, already salivating at the thought of his roast Wiltshire lamb. You’d expect good meat here — the restored, red-brick Victorian house where the bar is used to be an abattoir. Behind it, in a new construction of timber and glass, is the restaurant itself, a big and airy dining room, brimming with light. There are tables outside too. My pint of Lord Rivett bitter arrives with homemade sage and onion crisps, and a bowl of hummus so good I could scoff the lot and call it a day. But the show’s only beginning. Here come lamb-belly croquettes, paddling in a pea and mint soup, and crayfish cakes the size of tennis balls, with a tangy grapefruit mayonnaise; and glossy mackerel fillet with pickled mooli and a slab of brill as big as a paving stone, with shallots and purple- sprouting broccoli. And we haven’t even got to the main courses yet. Whatever you say about the Woodspeen, you can’t say they let you go hungry. For me, the portion sizes are just fine, although I find at least one element too many in a couple of the dishes. But at its unpretentious best, the Woodspeen is terrific - Sussex sirloin with triple-cooked chips, or a fabulous lemon meringue pie. The waiting staff are an enthusiastic lot, and Fm even a convert to the resiny Turkish wine - a steal at £20 a bottle. ‘We’re just doing simple food, perfectly in season,’ says Mr Campbell, buttonholing me on the way out. ‘Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,’ I should reply, quoting da Vinci.

Only it’s fine because it has the word ‘humane’ in the product description, so, yeah, that. BUT imagine how useful it might be in so many other situations - for example, for children who insist on asking questions while you are talking. For grannies who get spinach stuck in their teeth and it’s embarrassing for everyone if you point it out verbally.

The Amano tongue cleanser is leagues ahead of the rest of the field - designed in Italy to give a superior and long- lasting tongue-cleaning performance, it swiftly and VISIBLY removes the complex and possibly deadly bacteria lying dormant in your mouth. Its two-handle design counters the gag refiex, so you can finally clean farther back on your tongue, where the really hardcore debris lurks ominously.

Next time he has drunk several beers between holes, is caught short at the l4th, finds it’s a half mile back to the clubhouse loos and just doesn’t want to go toilet against a tree in front of his chums (especially if one of them is his boss), here is the answer — he pulls out his UroGlub, unscrews its triple-seal, leakproof cap, clips the privacy towel between the UroGlub and his belt and relieves himself into the pee chamber before bouncing back into the game. The wee-wee will be carefully stored inside the waterproof golf-club handle and can be emptied at a later date... OR (preferably) it can be forgotten about and discovered two months later when he next plays golf, mistakes the UroGlub for his favourite putter, unscrews the cap thinking it’s a handle protector and covers himself in stale pee.

But the mat... it’s... you know... telling me what I weigh!’ Me: ‘And how much is that, Katie Hopkins?’ Katie: ‘Well it’s... it’s private, isn’t it?’ Me: ‘Not any more.’ In development SINGING DEER You already know that thing when someone makes you a godparent to their son but unfortunately you don’t like the parents, let alone the child, and you long to be relinquished of all responsibilities, so you buy the five-year-old boy a large drum kit and then you never hear from them again. Well, this singing deer is a bit like the adult version of the drum kit. It’s so sweet-looking that your ‘friend’ will want to put it on their wall — but then when anybody comes within 1 5 feet of its radar, it will start to sing ‘Rawhide’ while waggling its ears, opening its mouth and shaking its head. Gome on, what’s not to love about that? NB I once had a life-sized Father Ghristmas version of this - when anyone came close, it sang ‘Frosty the Snowman and started to do a jolly dance.

In other words, it is the spiritual home of your true, undiluted fashion identity. If you are minimal, then - pow! - pare things down. If you are colourful, then give it the full bird of paradise. If you are a diva, then... wham! And if you are all floral and girlish, then it s playtime. As with your wedding day, a white-tie party is not the time to experiment. The moment you try to be who you are not, the inauthenticity will show and people will feel slightly seasick when they look at you. White tie is where you play to your strengths. And, seeing as you have to wear long, it evens out the playing field for those whose pins are not focus-pullers. It helps out the chicks with thighs and hips and tits. Because white tie is where womanly lives. As for dos and don ts? Careful with the slashed to the thigh and slashed to the navel unless you are going to the British Soap Awards. And wear long. Always long. That’s the entire point. ^ EARRINGS, £26,000, SUNGLASSES, £330, BY DIOR PLEXIGLAS CLUTCH, £7,137, BY CHANEL STATE OCCASION The only time one looks appropriate rather than ridic in over-the-elbow gloves.

Beyond that, all’s fair: sky-high shoes, fur, legs out, let them look... BLACK TIE T he universe has shifted, you see. What you wear for black tie is what your mother wore for a cocktail party. Some may say that standards have slipped. We respectfully say: nonsense, old guard. Standards have merely... loosened. If white tie remains the preserve of the long, full-on, dernier mot in all things evening and formal and ceremonial, then black tie can embrace real pizzazz. Black tie doesn’t need to worry about etiquette. There are no rights and wrongs, really, but I would say: when operating in this arena, if it’s short it should be architected and if it’s long it should be a little more pulled apart. In other words, a second-skin Lycra minidress will not take us beyond 21sts and a corseted floor-length proposition can feel a bit precious. Black tie is where evening structure comfortably (comfortably?) sits. It’s where boning (!), asymmetries, sheer panelling and all that good stuff come into play. It’s red-carpet dressing without the dangerous Miss World minefleld that one always has to negotiate with a white-tie situation, but it is most deflnitely lounge suit’s bigger, richer sister (see next page). As for the old black-tie rules? Leather bags and shoes still look rubbishy with anything that could be called a proper evening dress. And shorts? Even glittery ones? Think again.

LACE & SUEDE HEELS, £625, BY TABITHA SIMMONS LOUNGE SUIT T his, in modern parlance, just means smart . Suits for men. With ties - although most forgive an open-necked shirt where they condemn a pair of Converse. That’s just not a droll look any more. And for the ladies? Well, this is where the world becomes your oyster. This is just dress up’. Look your best. By far the best dress code for pulling in because there are fewer nerves attached. Less commitment involved. Lounge suit, for women, kind of means look hot’. The secret here is never to look corporate. No skirt suits. No leather over-the-shoulder bags, no leather court shoes or ballet pumps. You can really have fun with the bits and pieces here. Oxygenate. But don’t hyperventilate unless you are among oligarchs and non-doms. The really full-on frocks have graduated to black tie over the past 20 years and, in this particular category, deshabille is preferable to de trop. Lounge suit is just a slightly disheartening label for the funnest fashion arena. We should reclaim it.

Beautiful coat and hot, slightly mad heels -Tabitha Simmons, maybe. LEATHER BOOTIES, £725, BY TABITHA SIMMONS WEDDINGS T t s Still a bit shitty to wear white. So don’t. But fling on black or red with abandon because those old decrees seem silly now, particularly for town weddings. To hat or not to hat is at your discretion - whichever suits you best. But no to fascinators. Never to fascinators. Burn them. They are fascinating only in their unremitting awfulness. Someone had to come out and say it. Replace them with hair jewels — flne or costume — which are playful and pretty and ageless and useful. How do we feel about bosoms in church? Hmmm. Fine if you don’t mind being gossiped about, because people will. And they’ll cast aspersions. Easy enough to cover up for the service and then do the big reveal over champagne. Or wear sheer: tarty but somehow blameless. As for skirt length? As long as no one can see your knickers, do your worst. Wedding trousers are tricky - though not impossible if you have the elan and the cojones - but wedding culottes are witty. Unlike fascinators. [> EL CHIRINGUITO, IBIZA Zara Simon jewellery.
