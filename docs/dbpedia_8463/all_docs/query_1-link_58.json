        "text": "Maison Martell announces an audacious new campaign – its biggest, boldest yet – featuring legendary actors Tony Leung and Eddie Peng together onscreen for the very first time ever, to celebrate the iconic Martell Cordon Bleu and the emblematic Martell XXO.\n\nTwo stars of the cinema come together for a special Martell Campaign\n\nFor its new campaign in Asia, Maison Martell celebrates two of its exceptional cognacs: Martell Cordon Bleu and Martell XXO. Ambassadors for the Maison in Asia, actors Tony Leung and Eddie Peng have already appeared individually in Martell campaigns, but this will be the first time they come together onscreen, in two ambitious, audacious films.\n\nThe two actors are constantly pushing their own limits, thriving at the top of their craft. Originally from Hong Kong, Tony Leung is a major star of the cinema, both in Asia and beyond, and was recently awarded a Lion d’Or at Mostra in Venice in 2023 for his magnificent career. Eddie Peng is one of Asia’s most recognisable actors, having starred in over 30 box-office hits, from blockbusters to indies. Together, Tony Leung and Eddie Peng are an excellent match for embodying the two prestigious cognacs featured in the campaign. “I am very happy to work with Martell again and it was a great honor to shoot with Tony,” Eddie Peng says. “We both liked the script so much and its concept of legacy, of passing the baton. It felt like we were able to positively challenge and push one another.”\n\nThe new campaign will launch in continental China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, as well as Travel Retail in Asia. It will be revealed in two stages: December 25th, 2023 for Martell XXO and January 15th, 2024 for Martell Cordon Bleu.\n\nA Martell invitation to soar beyond the expected\n\nIn the Martell Cordon Bleu film, Eddie Peng is inspired by Tony Leung, as he sees him receiving his life achievement award. Later, as they engage in conversation over a glass of Cordon Bleu, Tony proposes starring in a film together. In the film we see them both pushing their boundaries as they engage in an energetic chase across Parisian rooftops. The movie concludes with a celebration of their success, raising a toast to continuously soaring beyond the expected with a glass of Martell Cordon Bleu.\n\nThe film has been created to reinforce the extraordinary success of Martell Cordon Bleu, created in 1912, and the Maison’s continued quest for excellence. Recognised as the world’s number one prestige cognac and one of the finest cognacs ever crafted, it is a product that continues to evolve, proving that success is a continuous journey of breakthroughs.\n\nIn the Martell XXO film, Tony challenges Eddie to co-star in a movie that unfolds against a sensational cinematic backdrop. We follow the two actors from the spotlight of Tony Leung’s award ceremony to a breath-taking setting among dizzying mountain peaks. As they skilfully navigate the slopes on snowboards, both Tony and Eddie make the bold decision to go beyond their limits, proving that those who inspire you also empower you to reach greater heights. Together, they share a glass of Martell XXO to celebrate this achievement, demonstrating that the ultimate form of success is reached collectively.\n\nMartell’s long-standing history of always going a step further inspired Martell Cellar Master, Christophe Valtaud in crafting Martell XXO, drawing on 300 years of savoir-faire. A testament to the transmission of expertise, Martell XXO is a remarkable cognac that elevates any occasion with its elegance, smoothness, and complexity. Christophe Valtaud created the blend from 450 old eaux-de-vie, the youngest aged 14 years, placing it in the prestigious category of extra extra old cognacs, and symbolising Maison Martell’s capacity to exceed expectations.\n\nBehind the scenes with international creative talents\n\nTo dream up this campaign and bring it to life, Maison Martell is working with two acclaimed international talents.\n\nWing Shya, long-time collaborator of Wong Kar-Waï, has created the films and key visuals for the lifestyle campaign. A renowned artist, photographer, and director with an elevated style, he uses fast-paced and sophisticated imagery to craft emotionally rich films. While they share a common thread, the two films are aesthetically distinct, reflecting their unique messages: Martell Cordon Bleu is treated with a warmer ambiance, while Martell XXO basks in cool elegance, in silver tones that echo the cognac’s bottle. The swift, Maison Martell’s icon, soars across both films, uniting them and symbolising the Maison’s spirit of freedom. In Wing Shya’s words, “This isn’t the first time I’ve worked with Tony or Eddie but having them both onscreen transforms the experience. It feels just like just the right fit with Martell, and the idea of a timeless ongoing legacy.”\n\nFilmmaker and photographer Ryan Hopkinson created the product-focused films and key visuals for XXO, bringing further depth to the lifestyle campaign. He works across disciplines with a refined aesthetic attuned to the worlds of advertising and luxury. For Martell XXO, his conceptual art direction brings precise styling and an eye for cinematic detail. By playing with angles, camera movements and lighting, Hopkinson brings a sensation of verticality to evoke the elevated tasting experience of Martell XXO. The music paired with the animated key visual underscores a sense of vertical progression and elevation.\n\nAbout Martell\n\nThe oldest of the great cognac houses, founded by Jean Martell in 1715, Maison Martell is renowned throughout the world for the finesse and elegance of its cognacs, the result of a legacy of savoir-faire handed down through nine generations. Together with a passion for its craft and a profound attachment to the terroir, Maison Martell is defined by the audacity with which it has challenged convention to create new expressions of cognac, including the icon Martell Cordon Bleu in 1912. The free spirit of the House is symbolised by its historic emblem: the swift.\n\nCredits:\n\nCreative Agency: BBH China Limited\n\nProduction House: Shanghai Smooth Co Limited"
