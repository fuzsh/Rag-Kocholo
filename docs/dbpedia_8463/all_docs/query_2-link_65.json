        "text": "Merry Christmas, dearest readers! It‚Äôs that time of the year again when I look back into the dramas that I‚Äôve watched in a year. Comparing it to my 2016 record of 12 dramas and 6 specials, I only managed to finish 10 dramas this year and most of them were even started last year. What a great decline and the trend observed was that as I grew older, the less dramas I get to watch when I thought it would be the opposite *sighs*.\n\nOn a brighter side, I ended up loving more than half of the dramas that I watched out of 10 so quality over quantity was probably the main theme of this year‚Äôs drama round-up. I‚Äôll stop talking now and hope you can join me in going through this wonderful drama year!\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nIt‚Äôs been a while since I finished watching Three Lives Three World: Ten Miles of Peach Blossom. I was addicted and completed all 58 episodes in 4 days. One of the most enjoyable thing while watching was reading the comments!\n\nIt provided me with quite a bit of insights and a lot of amusement. So I picked some of my favourite comments that I either found really funny or agreed with to translate. Enjoy!\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nEPIC, AMAZING, FANTASTIC, BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL, ADDICTING, and all the other positive adjectives you could think of.\n\nYes, I‚Äôm officially part of the millions of people who got drunk with peach blossom wine. If you have been following us on Twitter, you could have easily seen how rapid the system of ‚ÄúEternal Love‚Äù was eating me up. It is now one of the dramas that I consider very close to my heart since it has saved me from a drama slump (suffered for 3 months or more lol). If you want to know more of my thoughts regarding China‚Äôs biggest hit drama of the year, then go on and read some more.\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nMy previous Movie Monday with an action theme didn‚Äôt really get a lot of feedback compared to my first one which dealt with first love. I‚Äôm going to assume that this post will get more feedbacks because of one thing: it‚Äôs all about ROMANCE!\n\nLove really does make the world go round as proven by these five films which had romance as its central theme. Some were a hit and miss while some were definitely not to be missed.\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nSorry it took me forever before posting another Movie Monday! It‚Äôs all piling up now as I‚Äôve been watching a lot of movies recently. As the title states, I‚Äôll be reviewing 5 movies which fall under the Action genre. It‚Äôs also part 1 out of an uncertain number because only time can tell how many action films I‚Äôd be watching throughout the years haha!\n\nTrust me, I‚Äôm no action fan because I‚Äôm all for romance, comedy, melodrama, etc. and basically not action at all but I managed to enjoy these titles. After all, what is life without any action? üòâ\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\n2016 is looking good for the Chinese entertainment industry! It seems like the drama and movie gods have been reading my Christmas Wishlist from last year‚Ä¶ HAHA! You may read more on the upcoming dramas in blogs such as AVirtualVoyage and CDramaDevotee. For this post, I‚Äôll be mainly posting about the projects that I‚Äôm really excited about and some may have not been covered by other blogs so might as well spread the love!\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nI‚Äôm back to give you the 2nd part (and last!) 2015 Drama Round-Up! If you missed part 1 then I suggest you read it here for other drama reviews üòÄ\n\nStill the same disclaimer: These are brief (not really brief for some lol) reviews of all the dramas that I watched this year. So this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the dramas were all made in 2015 as the title of this post may have suggested.\n\nI have divided it into parts just like the last time: STORY IN A NUTSHELL (without spoilers, I promise!), POSITIVE (+) & NEGATIVE (-) things about it, and my OVERALL RATING.\n\nAre we ready? üòÄ\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nI was supposed to create a year-end post of all the Asian movies that I watched this year but I realized that it might actually be already 2016 and I still won‚Äôt be able to finish this post haha! (I have watched 46 this year alone and counting).\n\nMost people are into Asian dramas more than their films but there are times that I prefer the latter because it does not take so much time compared to the former. It would also be a waste if I just keep watching them and not write reviews about it. Thus, the birth of this segment!\n\nIn this first #MovieMonday, I‚Äôll be reviewing five movies (3 Taiwanese and 2 Chinese) which deals with the theme: ‚ÄúFirsts‚Äù. Go read more to find out!\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí"
