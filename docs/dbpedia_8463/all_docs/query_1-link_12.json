They often use their intuition to help them understand people and figure out what they are really thinking or feeling. This ability to read people can make INFJs seem like mind readers, and they are often able to see into people better than they can see into themselves. INFJs are always looking out for the needs of others, and they are always ready to lend a helping hand. They are also natural communicators, and they have a gift for inspiring others. They want genuine interactions. They are the unpretentious friends who make life easier by making a one-call-away friendship offer. Understanding people's intentions help them identify the few who will fit into their restricted circle. INFJs are good confidants who like helping others succeed. They have high standards in perfecting their art because of their exact brains. Good enough won't do till they've seen the best ending conceivable. These people are not hesitant to confront the existing quo when necessary. When compared to the genuine inner workings of the mind, their face worth signifies nothing to them."
