        "text": "For someone who never considered entering showbiz, Eddie Peng has certainly carved out an amazing acting career. He is arguably the Chinese film industrys most recognizable and bankable star today, having starred in over 30 box-office hits - a canny mix of epic blockbusters and indie projects. Peng migrated to Canada when he was 13 and spent the next 10 years there. In 2002, the Economics major (University of British Columbia) returned to Taipei to attend his grandmothers funeral, and was cast in the TV series Tomorrow as the second male lead."
