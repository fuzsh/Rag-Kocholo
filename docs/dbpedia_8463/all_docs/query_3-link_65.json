        "text": "Choi Siwon, South Korean singer and member of K-pop boy band Super Junior, took the second spot of the Annual Independent Critics List of the 100 Most Handsome Faces of 2014 released by TC Candler, a U.S. film rating site.\n\nIt is the second time that the list rolled out its male edition, which covers 100 handsome faces from almost 30 countries. The list aims to be a very international one that measures a mix of \"many cultures, lifestyles, professions and degrees of fame,\" rather than \"a popularity contest,\" according to the website.\n\nSouth Korea has nine male celebrities included onto the overall list, trailing only to the United States with 30 and the United Kingdom with 18. Japan had three celebrities on the list.\n\nChinese Japanese actor Takeshi Kaneshiro ranked 29th on the overall list, while Chinese Canadian actors Eddie Peng and Godfrey Gao seized the 71th and the 76th spots respectively. Chinese American actor Andy On ranked 91st.\n\nKim Soo-hyun, the South Korean actor who starred in the hit TV series My Love from the Star, snapped the 93rd spot.\n\nFollowing are the top ten most handsome faces in Asia in 2014.\n\nDong Young-bae (Taeyang) 董永培(太阳)\n\nNationality: South Korea\n\nBorn: May 18, 1988\n\nOccupation: Singer, dancer, model"
