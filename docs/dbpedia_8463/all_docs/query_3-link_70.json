        "text": "Besides celebrating International Women's Day (Mar 8) and St Patrick's Day (Mar 17), here's something else you can celebrate in the month of March - the birth of these sexy male celebs.\n\nThe world will be a lot less bright (and beautiful) without them. Here's wishing they're having a good one, wherever they are.\n\nLEE HONG-GI (MAR 2, 1990)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B8NRt5OHE9Z/[/embed]\n\nSouth Korean star Lee Hong-gi is also a celebrated singer and actor. The 30-year-old began his showbiz career as a child actor in 2002's TV drama Magic Kid Masuri, and has since appeared in many productions including You're Beautiful (2009) alongside CN Blue's Jung Yong-hwa and actress Park Shin Hye, My Girlfriend Is a Nine-Tailed Fox (2010) with Lee Seung-Gi and Shin Min-ah and The Korean Odyssey that starred Lee Seung-gi, Cha Seung-won, Oh Yeon-seo.\n\nHong-gi is also noted for being the frontman and main vocalist for South Korean rock band F.T. Island.\n\nThe multi-hyphenate has also gone into a solo singing career with his album FM302 (2015), started his own fashion label Skullhong and acted in theatre productions. What an ace.\n\nBTS' SUGA (MAR 9, 1993)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BVCkugylnmo/[/embed]\n\nAlthough we get distracted by Suga's too-cute baby face, you should know not to underestimate this star. After all, Suga is a crucial member of hit Korean group BTS and has also been recognised for his rapping, songwriting and producing abilities.\n\nHailing from a lower income family in Daegu, South Korea, Suga's journey with music began after he had heard the song Fly from Korean hip hop group Epik High when he was younger.\n\nThis prompted him to learn rapping and music production that eventually led him to his achievements today.\n\nBesides his work with the group, Suga has also released his own solo mixtape, Agust D, in 2016 and has continued to find success as a lyricist and producer. Applause please.\n\nANSEL ELGORT (MAR 14, 1994)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BohrV4pAMBI/[/embed]\n\nWith his boyish smile and lean physique, it's not that difficult to see how 25-year-old Ansel Elgort rose to fame after successful roles in dystopian Divergent trilogy, teen romcom The Fault in Our Stars (2014) and action-thriller Baby Driver (2017).\n\nBorn to a fashion photographer and opera producer, the youngest child follows the footsteps of the family in showbiz and had his debut in horror movie Carrie (2013).\n\nSurprise surprise, Ansel also has a DJ alter-ego, Ans√∏lo, and has made his rounds in festivals such as the Ultra Music Festival in 2015.\n\nHe inked a deal with Island Records in 2015 and has since released several singles, even collaborating with American rapper Logic.\n\nThe avid skateboarder and sportsman will be returning to the silver screen with The Goldfinch that is set to be released in October.\n\nANTONI POROWSKI (MARCH 14, 1984)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B87U_vtHHS3/[/embed]\n\nIf you haven't watched Netflix's Queer Eye, you're totally missing out on a gem. For those who are familiar though, Antoni Porowski wouldn't be a stranger to you.\n\nKnown to be the food and wine expert on the show, Antoni's cooking prowess has seen him releasing his own cookbook, Antoni in the Kitchen, and restaurant The Village Den in New York City.\n\nCooking isn't the only thing Antoni is proud of though. He regularly indulges us with a thirst trap on Instagram, posing half-naked and sometimes, only in his underwear. Let's just say we ain't complainin'.\n\nSCOTT EASTWOOD (MAR 21, 1986)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BzGYH-ZHYoO/[/embed]\n\nDespite having prominent actor-director Clint Eastwood as his father (he's the youngest son), Scott Eastwood started his acting career by attending castings with his given name, Scott Clinton Reeves.\n\nFun fact, the 33-year-old auditioned for all his father's movies, and was rejected for the Clint Eastwood-directed American Sniper. It was only in 2008 that he decided to celebrate his family legacy and go by his father's last name.\n\nHis gruff, manly features and muscled physique made him perfect for roles in movies such as Fury (2014), DC Comics' Suicide Squad (2016) and Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018).\n\nHe also acted as Taylor Swift's love interest in her music video Wildest Dreams (BTW, he kisses her), and is the face of Davidoff Parfums' Cool Water.\n\nAccording to IMDB, Scott, who has his own spirits brand, is slated to star in The Outpost alongside Orlando Bloom and The Manuscript with Morgan Freeman and Jamie Foxx.\n\nEDDIE PENG YU-YAN (MAR 24, 1982)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B7IZmS5DCO6/[/embed]\n\nElegance is an attitude, and it's an attitude that Taiwanese-Canadian actor Eddie Peng doesn't seem to lack.\n\nThe 37-year-old hottie debuted in a 2001 drama Tomorrow that starred Rainie Yang and Shawn Yue, and later found growing success with hits like 2011 teen film Jump Ashin!, 2013 action film Unbeatable and 2015 sports film To the Fore alongside Choi Siwon.\n\nHis role in Unbeatable had earned him his second Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards nomination.\n\nWith his bad boy looks and bushy brows, Eddie is the face for multiple labels including Swiss watchmaker Longines, Japanese cosmetic label Kate and Chinese smartphone Vivo (ousting Song Joong-ki).\n\nHe's also the first Asian brand ambassador for French luxury brand Berluti. Impressive.\n\nWe can't wait for him to return to our screens with Cold War 3, which has a star-studded cast of Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, Chow Yun-Fatt and Tony Leung.\n\nLEE PACE (MAR 25, 1979)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/Beyc308lk4X/[/embed]\n\nWith a pair of soulful grey eyes framed by thick eyebrows, you might not recognise American actor Lee Pace for his roles as Thranduil the Elvenking in The Hobbit trilogy or as villain Ronan the Accuser in Guardians of the Galaxy, the latter a role he will reprise in 2019 Captain Marvel.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who stands at a towering 1.96m, is also known for his role as pie-maker Ned, who could revive the dead with his touch, in fantasy mystery drama Pushing Daisies that earned him Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy nominations.\n\nThe actor also made headlines recently for coming out.\n\nCHOI WOO-SHIK (MARCH 26, 1990)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Wl28_ns0t/[/embed]\n\nDon't be fooled by Choi Woo-shik's youthful looks (he's turning 30). The South Korean actor has already racked up international acclaim and starring credits, most recently in Bong Joon-ho's Parasite.\n\nWoo-shik has also starred in another popular film, Train to Busan (2016), and other hit films such as Set Me Free (2014) and Okja (2017). The young actor has also dabbled in TV including Rooftop Prince (2012) and The Package (2017).\n\nYou can expect to see his face on the big screen in 2020 as he is slated to appear in four films, the most notable of which is Wonderland, where he would star alongside Suzy Bae and Park Bo Gum.\n\nEXO'S XIUMIN (MAR 26, 1990)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BxJOPgPHt5S/[/embed]\n\nKim Min-seok, or better known by his stage name Xiumin, is a member of popular Korean boyband EXO who debuted in 2012.\n\nAnd he's not just a pretty face - Xiumin holds a black belt in kendo and taekwondo and is an avid football fan. Besides regularly contributing his vocals to drama theme songs, including Moon Lover: Scarlet Heart Ryeo with fellow groupmates Chen and Baekhyun, the 29-year-old has also starred in a movie Seondal: The Man Who Sells the River (2016) with Yoo Seung-ho.\n\nWhether it is with EXO or sub-unit EXO-CBX, we can't wait for Xiumin's next musical release.\n\nJJ LIN JUN JIE (MAR 27, 1981)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B9EWDHJlztO/[/embed]\n\nWe are not exaggerating when we say Lin Jun Jie, who is widely known as JJ Lin or his lesser known English name Wayne, is one of Singapore's biggest musicians.\n\nThe Mandopop singer, who started his musical career by writing songs for artists like A-Mei and Harlem Yu, debuted in 2003 with Music Voyager.\n\nSince then, the 38-year-old, who finished a 11-month tour last month, has released 12 albums and his songs like Dou Jiang You Tiao (2004), Ke Xi Mei Ru Guo (2014) and Bu Wei Shui Er Zuo De Ge (2015) remain firm favourites amongst fans.\n\nThe talented singer-pianist, who has won multiple Golden Melody Awards, is also known for his vocal prowess during live performances.\n\nApart from his soulful voice, deep set dimples and boyish charms, he is also an avid Star Wars fan, loves playing online games, and has been frequently spotted in hawker centres here.\n\nA humble superstar? We love.\n\nJACKSON WANG (MAR 28, 1994)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B8adzwQp-Gy/[/embed]\n\nPerhaps the most outspoken member of Korean boyband GOT7, Jackson Wang is a Hong Kong rapper and singer who is also known for his dancing and hosting abilities.\n\nRaised by parents who were former athletes, Wang's trim build and chiselled frame can be attributed to his years of fencing training as part of the Hong Kong national team, which he gave up to pursue his musical career.\n\nA newly minted Chinese ambassador for Fendi, you can take photos with this handsome fella, or at least his wax figure, at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong.\n\nJAM HSIAO (MAR 30, 1987)\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Nkf00nIp5/[/embed]\n\nLook at those cheekbones and that porcelain skin! Since debuting in Taiwanese TV talent competition One Million Star and later collaborating with Taiwan's pop star A-Mei in 2007, Jam Hsiao was plucked from obscurity and is now one of the most recognisable names in Mandopop.\n\nThe 32-year-old multiple award-winning singer has also diversified into movies such as The Killer Who Never Kills (2011), My Geeky Nerdy Buddies (2014) and The Faces of My Gene (2018).\n\nNeed another reason to love him? Jam is an animal lover and lives with six dogs and four cats, all of whom were adopted."
