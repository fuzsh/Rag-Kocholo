        "text": "I know it should not be a movie that I’m supposed to put in here but I just want to write somethings that I missed when I first watched the movie or the second or third time I watched it. (Actually, I really don’t know how many times I watched it already. By watch, I mean, saw some scenes on tv or when my bro or dad watches it. But I really finished the movie only twice. The first and last night.)\n\nSo, what did I miss while watching the 7-year old movie back then? HAHAHA… Just not recognizing Eddie Peng, Maki Yoko, Tsumabuki Satoshi, and Kitagawa Keiko. LOL\n\nThe most obvious were Tsumabuki Satoshi and Kitagawa Keiko. They have appeared longer than the other two, specially Keiko.\n\nTsumabuki Satosi played the one who initiates the race saying GO. Well, I don’t know what you call those people but he was captioned as EXCEEDINGLY HANDSOME GUY. HAHAHA.\n\nKitagawa Keiko played as a member of the lead actor’s group. When I saw her in the classroom, I was like “Wow, she’s got an angelic face.” I really did not recognize her because she really looks young in this movie. Then, I saw the cast when the movie ended. LOL.\n\nShe first appeared during the first race shown in Tokyo checking cars.\n\nNext we see her at the school.\n\nThen, laughing during a baseball game.\n\nI thought she’s just some pretty girl but she’s also playing a mechanic here.\n\nAnd, lastly, during the last race (excluding the race with Vin Diesel).\n\nI didn’t know that Maki Yoko and Eddie Peng also appeared until I saw the cast list at the end of the movie.\n\nMaki Yoko acted as the woman who slept with the lead actor’s father when he arrived in Tokyo.\n\nOn the other hand, Eddie Peng played as a DJ, and the most unrecognizable for me. (I know he is Eddie Peng because he looks like Eddie Peng. I was confused before, whether he is Eddie Peng or Jimmy Lin because the credits say there is a Jimmy Lin… I thought he was the Chinese Actor. Unfortunately, it was a different Jimmy Lin.) >.<\n\nSo, that’s it."
