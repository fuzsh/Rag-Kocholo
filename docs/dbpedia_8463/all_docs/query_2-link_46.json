        "text": "Mention Eddie Peng, and you’ll likely hear the squeal of a fan-girl nearby.\n\nHaving been nominated several times for Best Actor for the Golden Horse Awards, the Taiwanese-Canadian actor is capable of more than just evoking lovelorn sighs and screams. But he is not content to simply coast by on his chiselled good looks and ripped model-esque physique, choosing instead to select varied roles that challenge him to learn new sports or skills from scratch or endure long periods of intensive training. To date, he’s played — deep breath now — a professional boxer, a professional gymnast, a professional cyclist, a culinary prodigy, legendary martial arts master Wong Fei Hung, and now a police-officer-turned-villain with an IQ of 192 in the upcoming movie Cold War 2.\n\nAt just 34, the boyish-looking heartthrob has amassed an impressive array of movies and accolades under his belt. This year alone, he has seven movies airing on the big screens, with roles ranging from cameo to main lead, alongside heavyweights like Aaron Kwok, Chow Yun Fatt, Sammo Hung, and Tony Leung. He is also part of the star-studded cast of The Great Wall (Feb 2017), a blockbuster sci-fi action film that is directed by Zhang Yimou and stars Matt Damon, Willem Dafoe, and Andy Lau.\n\nPeng is the quintessential Aries male: he is a go-getter who thrives on challenges and never shies away from taking risks and breaking new ground. He has built a solid reputation in being one of the few male actors who go above and beyond in method acting, earning the praise of veteran actors like Sammo Hung and Tony Leung, who have been roundly impressed by his tenacity and dedication to his roles.\n\nHis acting career wasn’t entirely a walk in the park, though. In 2009, he faced issues with his contract and as a result was jobless for two years. This made him even more grateful for his breakout role in Jump! Ashin (2011), where he trained for the better part of the year to play a competitive gymnast instead of relying on a body double. His performance in that movie earned him his first Best Actor nomination, and had many directors come knocking with meaty roles.\n\nWith his never-say-die attitude and unfailingly positive outlook in life, he is also well-known for his Eddie-isms, which his fans frequently quote when the going gets tough. Here are some of his best quotes that will have you carpe-ing all the diem:\n\n“Tell yourself that you can do it, because no one else will help you do it. It is entirely up to you — only you know where your direction is and where your dreams are.” (2014)\n\n“Our dreams may start off being very far from us. But when we strive for them, they become a lot closer.” (2015)\n\n“I told myself that if I give up now, I’ll have nothing to show for my efforts. So since I’m going to do it, I’m going to do it well.” (2016)\n\n“The ingredients to success, to me, is having faith in yourself and passion in what you do.” (2013)\n\n“It doesn’t matter how many accolades I receive for my work. What matters is whether I enjoy what I do. The process is always far more enjoyable than arriving at my destination.”\n\nCold War 2 opens in cinemas on 8 July."
