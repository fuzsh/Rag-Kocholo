        "text": "Did your Longines help you wake up on time this morning?\n\nThat was the first question I asked Chinese actor-singer Eddie Peng as soon as he sat down for this interview at the recent launch of the first Longines mono-brand boutique in the Philippines at the second floor of SM Megamall’s Building A.\n\n“Hahahaha,” laughed Eddie, “yes, it always does. It never fails.”\n\nAn Aries (Western horoscope) and a Dog (Chinese zodiac), Eddie was born on March 24, 1982 in Taipei where he’s known as Peng Yu-yan. Eddie migrated to Vancouver at age 13 and studied at the University of British Columbia where he majored in Economics. His dream to be a businessman was nipped in the bud when he went back to Taipei because of his grandmother’s death. He got stuck in his birth place when he was discovered by director Yang Daqing who cast him in the TV series The White Paper of Love. Goodbye, business! Hello, acting! There was no stopping Eddie since then.\n\nDescribed as having “an open personality,” Eddie works not only in Taiwanese projects but also those in Korean. Filipino fans probably remember him for the Koreanovela Scent of Love, one of the more than two dozen TV shows he has done so far, plus about two dozen movies, numerous music videos, etc.\n\nAs the newest “Longines Ambassador of Elegance,” Eddie joins the elite ranks of Kate Winslet, Simon Baker, Chi Ling Lin, Aaron Kwok and Aishwarya Rai. Every inch of Eddie exudes Elegance (with a Capital E), after all, isn’t the brand’s catch phrase “Elegance is an Attitude?”\n\nHere’s how our one-on-one went:\n\nYour record as an actor is impressive.\n\n“Actually, I’m quite young in showbiz because I started acting only 10 years ago. I started working with Longines (pronounced lon-gin) and I’ve been promoting it in many places. I try to be more elegant not only at work but in daily life.”\n\nHow long have you been wearing Longines before you were enlisted as endorser?\n\n“I didn’t have one but my mom had a few. I’ve known Longines ever since I was a kid because my mom knows the brand very well. My grandma has one.”\n\nHow does Longines help in your career?\n\n“I have to be on time in my appointments, I have to be punctual. My work and watch-making are pretty much the same because both involve designing. In making watches, you have to work on details, creating something basically from nothing. Acting is also creating something out of a character also practically from zero to become a real person.”\n\nDo you go to bed with your Longines?\n\n“Oh yes, I do. It’s a durable timepiece. The one I’m wearing is from the Aqua Series and I can go diving with it. It’s sporty. I always wear Longines in every movie and TV show that I do.”\n\nHow many Longines do you have?\n\n“Five.”\n\nYour schedule is very hectic. How do you spend your time away from work?\n\n“I do find a balance between work and leisure time. Sometimes, I train hard physically and mentally, so when I’m free I spend time with my family. Time is very important. Sometimes, I go biking in the mountain or jogging.”\n\nWho are your role models?\n\n“I have several idols. My all-time favorites are Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Among Asian actors, my favorites are Aaron Kwok, Tony Leung and Chow Yun Fat…so many Asian actors that I look up to and hope that someday I can work with them.”\n\nWhat time are you in your best mood?\n\n“Maybe in the morning. You wake up early in the morning from good sleep and you feel light. You have a clear mind, ready to do a lot of things. You take a light breakfast and then you exercise. Then, read a script or a book.”\n\nHow do you divide your time among your many activities?\n\n“It’s tough to divide my time. If I do a movie, I spend a lot of time on the set. Once I finish, I try to relax and prepare for another shoot the next day.”\n\nBy the way, you were introduced by Johnny Litton, the host of today’s Longines event, as single and available. What type of girls do you find attractive?\n\n“Maybe, someone I can really talk to, who has the same mindset as mine, somebody I can learn from. And, yes, she must love Longines, too, hahahaha!”"
