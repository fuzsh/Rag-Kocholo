        "text": "I first started watching dramas back when I was 8 years old because “Meteor Garden” was such a phenomenon. Up to now, I only know one person who never got into the hype and we all still jokingly judge her because of it haha! I watched K-dramas in the same local channel that aired Meteor Garden years after. My love for Asian dramas eventually died and I went on to watch Western shows and I never imagined myself re-entering Dramaland. Not until the local channel that decided to air “Meteor Garden” two years ago and voila! This is already my third year of watching dramas. Good times, good times.\n\nWhen I wrote my 2015 Year-End Drama Round-Up (part 1 & part 2), some dramas that I’ve watched already were being recommended. It was then that I realized that I never wrote about it here that’s why they were probably suggesting it. With that, I wrote about the dramas that I watched in my first year of fully getting into this wonderful world called dramaland. A lot of the dramas mentioned are very special in my heart and if only I could have all the time and willpower to write individual reviews on them, I would but the mini-reviews that you will be reading should suffice for now.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMy previous Movie Monday with an action theme didn’t really get a lot of feedback compared to my first one which dealt with first love. I’m going to assume that this post will get more feedbacks because of one thing: it’s all about ROMANCE!\n\nLove really does make the world go round as proven by these five films which had romance as its central theme. Some were a hit and miss while some were definitely not to be missed.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n2016 is looking good for the Chinese entertainment industry! It seems like the drama and movie gods have been reading my Christmas Wishlist from last year… HAHA! You may read more on the upcoming dramas in blogs such as AVirtualVoyage and CDramaDevotee. For this post, I’ll be mainly posting about the projects that I’m really excited about and some may have not been covered by other blogs so might as well spread the love!\n\nContinue reading →"
