        "text": "October 11, 2007\n\nsource: Electric NewPaper\n\nthanks francesca of asianfanatics\n\nHelp Jolin meet guys? No problem, Thursday October 11, 2007 Singapore\n\nActor Eddie Peng says he's not dating the pop princess\n\nNO, Taiwanese pop star Jolin Tsai is not his girlfriend. But Eddie Peng thinks she's 'a perfect friend'. That's what the boyishly handsome Taiwanese idol said in a recent phone interview with The New Paper, from Shanghai.\n\nThere has been talk that the 25-year-old actor is the singer's boyfriend, but he dismissed it as 'a rumour the paparazzi made up'. Speaking in competent English, thanks to his Canadian schooling, he said he often goes out with showbiz friends like Angela Chang, Terri Kwan and Peter Ho. But whenever he is seen hanging out with Jolin, everyone asks: Are you guys going out? He said some of his friends, whom he had got to know through singer/actor Lee Wei, also happened to be friends of Jolin.\n\nNEW SHOW\n\nEddie appears in the film My DNA Says I Love You, which opens here tomorrow. He plays Teddy, the son of a landlord, with an unrequited crush on their tenant (played by Chinese actress Yu Nan). She already has a boyfriend, but he goes out of his way to try to win her over.\n\nIn real life, however, Eddie said he is a lot more cautious. Though he has had friends tell him about similar situations, he has never been in a situation like Teddy's, he said.\n\n'For myself, if a girl doesn't love me, forget it.'\n\nHe admitted he can't see himself spending so much time and making so many sacrifices for such a woman. But, he added, he would be good friends with her.\n\n'Who knows, she may break up with her boyfriend,' he said, laughing.\n\nThe movie also asks whether it is better to be with someone who is a 'perfect DNA match' but is never around. Or to be with someone less perfect but has time for you. Eddie said he preferred the latter. He also said he would certainly change himself for a girl he really loves, though he said sometimes his attempts to come off as the perfect guy backfires.\n\n'Being yourself is the smartest thing to do,' he said.\n\nHe said that when he was a 16-year-old studying in Vancouver, he fell in love with a girl about two years his junior. He thought she liked him too and they even exchanged numbers. During the summer vacation, he tried calling her to ask her out, but every time she was on the phone, he got tongue-tied and ended up looking stupid. In the end, 'I didn't even manage to ask her out once', he said sheepishly.\n\nCLUELESS\n\nLater on, when the school semester started, he found out she was dating a team-mate on his basketball team.\n\n'I didn't even know she liked him, not me!'\n\nEddie said he is the romantic type, influenced by the many movies he has watched. He said he believes in reincarnation, love at first sight and falling in love with girls who do not seem like perfect matches at first. But despite all that, he's still single and 'still looking'. He said his last relationship was back in Canada but it ended when he finished university and returned to Taiwan.\n\nWell, if he's not dating Jolin as he claims, would he help her if she asked him to introduce guys to her? After all, she has said in previous interviews that she is lonely and wants love.\n\n'She really said that?' he asked, cracking up.\n\n'Sure, if she's that lonely for love!'\n\nThen he added, in a more serious tone: 'I would introduce (them) if they just want to be friends - but if they want to take it to another level, it's not my business.'"
