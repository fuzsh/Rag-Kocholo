        "text": "Taiwanese-Canadian actor, singer and model\n\nEdward Peng Yu-Yan (Chinese: 彭于晏; pinyin: Péng Yúyàn; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Phêⁿ Û-àn; born 24 March 1982) is a Taiwanese actor, singer and model. He is best known for starring in the films Hear Me (2009), Unbeatable (2013), Fleet of Time (2014), To the Fore (2015), Operation Mekong (2016), Duckweed (2017), Wu Kong (2017), Hidden Man (2018), and The Rescue (2020).\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPeng was born in Penghu, Taiwan. He moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada at the age of thirteen. In 2000, he graduated from Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School.[1] Subsequently, he was admitted to the University of British Columbia and majored in economics, but later dropped out to begin his acting career.\n\nIn March 2021, Peng announced support for cotton from Xinjiang in mainland China, after some companies had expressed concerns about human rights abuses.[2]\n\nWhile filming Black Dog, Peng developed such a strong bond with his dog co-star Xin that he adopted her.[3][4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2002–2008: Beginnings\n\n[edit]\n\nPeng began his career when he was cast as in Tomorrow by director Yang Daqing during a summer vacation in Taiwan. The drama is adapted from the Japanese manga series Asunaro Hakusho, written by Fumi Saimon.[5] Peng built a teenage fan following after the romantic comedy gained popularity.[6] In 2003, he took on his first leading role in the Taiwanese drama Scent of Love, which tells the story of two star-crossed lovers who transcend life and death to find one another in their many reincarnations.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2005, he starred in the idol drama When Dolphin Met Cat, portraying an autistic youth. To prepare himself for the filming, Peng took one month to learn how to interact with dolphins from a trained instructor.[7] He then starred in Chinese xianxia drama Chinese Paladin and wuxia drama The Young Warriors, which were extremely popular during their run and led to increased recognition for him in the Mainland.[8]\n\nThereafter, Peng made his big screen debut in the movie Exit No.6 (2006), directed by Yu-Hsien Lin.[citation needed] The film put him on the radar of many film directors, including Tsui Hark who cast him in his 2008 romantic comedy, All About Women.[6] In 2007, Peng was nominated as Best New Actor at the 44th Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards for his performance in My DNA Says I Love You.[9]\n\n2009–2010: Contractual disputes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2009, Peng was involved in a contract dispute lawsuit against his former manager, reaching the nadir of his career. However, during this period, Peng starred in the movie Hear Me, directed by Fen-Fen Cheng, about a delivery boy who falls for a hearing impaired girl and communicates with her using sign language.[citation needed] The film was released a week prior to the opening of the 21st Summer Deaflympics,[10] and became the highest grossing locally produced movie at Taiwan's box office.[11]\n\nAfter winning the lawsuit in 2010, he released his debut EP titled It Has To Be You, which featured 5 songs under the management of Avex Group.[12]\n\nThe same year, he starred as the male lead in the movie Close to You. To portray his role as a boxer, Peng trained for three months prior to filming.[13] He was nominated in the Best Actor category at the 2nd Macau International Movie Festival for his performance.[14]\n\n2011–2013: Rising popularity\n\n[edit]\n\nPeng achieved breakthrough with his performance in the 2011 teen film Jump Ashin!, directed by Yu-Hsien Lin.[6] He reportedly trained eight months to portray an athlete. The film was a critical and commercial success.

The film earned nearly 200 million yuan ($32 million) in China, making it the highest-grossing Chinese-South Korean production.[27]\n\n2014–present: Box office success\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, Peng was cast as Wong Fei-hung in Rise of the Legend, the latest film about the iconic Kung-Fu master. He reportedly practiced 10 hours of martial arts every day to prepare for the role.[28] Peng was nominated in the Best Actor category at the 34th Hong Kong Film Award.[29] The same year, he starred in historical drama Sound of the Desert and coming-of-age film Fleet of Time, which were both commercial successes.[30][31] Peng's achievements in both the film and television industry brought his career to a new height.[32]\n\nIn 2015, Peng played a professional cyclist in sports film To the Fore.[33] He reportedly received training and earned qualifications for competitive racing during filming.[6] The film was selected to represent Hong Kong in the best foreign-language film category at the 88th Academy Awards.[34] Peng was also appointed the first Chinese Goodwill Ambassador of the 2015 Tour de France.[35] The same year, Peng starred alongside Shu Qi in romance film The Last Women Standing.[36]\n\nPeng achieved another breakthrough in 2016 with the film Operation Mekong, where he portrayed a hardcore undercover agent along with veteran actor Zhang Hanyu.[37] The film received critical acclaim, and is highest grossing Chinese cop film to date.[38] He also starred in romance film Run for Love alongside Zhang Ziyi,[39] police thriller Cold War 2 as an antagonist,[40] war epic Call of Heroes,[41] and Zhang Yimou's historical epic The Great Wall.[42]\n\nIn 2017, Peng co-starred in Han Han's film Duckweed alongside Deng Chao and Zanilia Zhao.[43] The sleeper hit gained commercial and critical success.[44][45] He then starred in war film Our Time Will Come directed by Ann Hui, playing a complicated anti-hero.[46][47] Peng then headlined his first film, fantasy epic Wu Kong where he played the title character.[48] The film was a box office success and grossed US$100 million at the box office.[6]\n\nIn 2018, Peng stars in the wuxia film Hidden Man, directed by Jiang Wen.[49]\n\nIn 2020, Peng starred in The Rescue, a thriller film directed by Dante Lam which focuses on an emergency rescue operative.[50] He is also set to star in period romance film Love After Love, directed by Ann Hui.[51]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear English title Original title Role 2005 A Record 记录 Ah Xiang 2006 Open To Midnight 午夜照相馆 A Hai[52] 2007 Muddy but Pure White 泥巴色的纯白 Tang Xuchuan Exit No. 6 六号出口 Fan Dayin My DNA Says I Love You 基因决定我爱你 Xiao Xiong 2008 Sleeplessness All Through the Night 公主在台北彻夜未眠 Gong Ping All About Women 女人不坏 Mo Qiyan[53] My So Called Love 爱的发声练习 A Liang[54] 2009 Hear Me 听说 Tian Kuo 2010 Lover's Discourse 恋人絮语 Li Guangsheng[55] Close to You 近在咫尺的爱恋 Zhao Dajie 2011 Love You You 夏日樂悠悠 You Lele Jump Ashin! 翻滚吧!阿信 Ashin 2012 LOVE 爱 Ah Kai Tai Chi 0 太極1：從零開始 Fang Zijing Tai Chi Hero 太極2：英雄崛起 Fang Zijing Cold War 寒戰 Joe Lee 2013 A Wedding Invitation 分手合約 Li Xing Unbeatable 激戰 Lin Siqi 2014 Rise of the Legend 黄飛鴻之英雄有夢 Wong Fei-hung Fleet of Time 匆匆那年 Chen Xun 2015 12 Golden Ducks 12金鸭 Cameo To the Fore 破風 Qiu Ming The Last Women Standing 剩者為王 Ma Sai 2016 Run for Love 奔愛 Feng Yujian The Bodyguard 我的特工爺爺 Cameo Cold War 2 寒戰2 Joe Lee Call of Heroes 危城歼霸 Ma Feng Operation Mekong 湄公河行動 Fang Xinwu The Great Wall 長城 General Wu 2017 Duckweed 乘風破浪 Xu Zhengtai Wu Kong 悟空傳 Sun Wukong Our Time Will Come 明月幾時有 Liu Heizai 2018 Hidden Man 邪不压正 Li Tianran 2019 Midnight Diner 深夜食堂 Guest appearance[56] 2020 The Rescue 紧急救援 Gao Qian 2021 Love After Love 第一炉香 Qiao Qiqia Are You Lonesome Tonight?
