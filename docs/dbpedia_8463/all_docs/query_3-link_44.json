        "text": "American-born Hong Kong actor Daniel Wu Neh-tsu has released his first video on social media in China in which he playfully urges people to stop using his Chinese name for online clout.\n\nWu is renowned for his rugged looks and outstanding acting skills. The 49-year-old is also hailed as a “flexible and distinctive actor” in the Chinese-language film industry.\n\nHis works include Westworld Season 4, The Heavenly Kings, and New Police Story.\n\nOn May 18, Wu debuted on Douyin – China’s equivalent to TikTok – with his first video receiving 4.5 million likes. His account on the platform also attracted 3 million followers.\n\nBefore this, he had one Weibo account with 9.6 million followers, where he frequently shared photos of his daily life.\n\nIn his latest Douyin video, Wu told how he had discovered hundreds of accounts that were using his Chinese name, Wu Neh-tsu, when he did a search.\n\nOne account, named Mountain City Wu Neh-tsu, boasts 7.8 million followers and is run by a 24-year-old gaming influencer.\n\nAnother, run by a finance professional who advises people about investments, is called Financial Wu Neh-tsu and has 620,000 followers.\n\nThe numerous other accounts incorporating the Wu Neh-tsu name include dance live-streamers and music influencers.\n\nWu humorously addressed the name-copying in his video, saying: “If you are all Wu Neh-tsu, then who am I?”\n\nHe urged people online to refrain from using his name to boost their profile and traffic, saying: “Please stop it, all the Neh-tsu’s!”\n\nOne online user pointed out the reason why people adopt Wu’s Chinese name as a username.\n\n“Wu Neh-tsu embodies handsomeness and success, which can attract a lot of traffic,” the person on Douyin commented.\n\nOthers praised Wu for his humorous approach, citing it as a wise and amiable warning.\n\n“Facing the annoying phenomenon of name-copying, Wu playfully self-deprecates, what a clever warning method,” another said.\n\nIt is common to see people using celebrities’ names to gain attention and express confidence in their own appearance on mainland social media platforms.\n\nThe Chinese name of the Taiwan actor Eddie Peng Yu-yan is one that is frequently used.\n\nRenowned for his charm, physique, and exceptional acting talent, the actor has been lauded in the mainland media as the “most perfect man”. Peng, 42, boasts 32 million followers on Weibo.\n\nFemale internet users often adopt the name of 36-year-old Chinese-American actress Liu Yifei – widely known as “Fairy Sister in China” – who has 72 million followers on Weibo."
