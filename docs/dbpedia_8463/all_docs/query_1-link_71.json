        "text": "Hong Kong – When it comes to Chinese actors popular with both men and women, Eddie Peng is definitely one of the few successful examples. Born in 1982, this talented actor has consistently been recognised by prestigious film awards such as the Hong Kong Film Awards and the Taipei Golden Horse Awards for his breakthrough performances in box office hits such as Unbeatable and Jump Ashin!\n\nUnlike other actors of the new generation, Peng seldom appears on public occasions such as reality shows, entertainment TV programmes and various high-paying, celebrity-driven appearances. He only focuses on acting in movies. He dares to challenge difficult characters, with each one he portrays very impressive. Before immersing himself in a new character, he invests time in acquiring many new skills to demonstrate on the screen. For instance, he studied gymnastics when starring in Jump Ashin! and practised assiduously when portraying a top cyclist in the feature To the Fore. Meanwhile, he subjects himself to a punishing schedule. In 2017 alone, we have already seen three movies in which he starred – namely, Duckweed, Our Time will Come and Wu Kong – all of which found huge success at the box office.\n\nThis month, the busy hotshot pays a visit to Hong Kong for the 2017 Longines Hong Kong International Races as the Ambassador of Elegance of the race sponsor, luxury Swiss timepiece brand Longines.\n\nDressed in a signature slim cut suit Longines Blue from head to toe – adorned with the latest timepiece model from the Record collection, the Official Watch of the Longines Hong Kong International Races – Peng looks as energetic and handsome in real life as he does in movies. Upon realising I hailed from Macau, he passionately spoke of his experiences in the city.\n\n“I shot a movie in Macau, Unbeatable, the one talking about MMA [Mixed Martial Arts]. I stayed there for sixty days. I went to the gym there. I trained up and down the stairs. It’s a nice place; I didn’t need to sneak out of the hotels because the hotels already have entertainment,” Peng laughed.\n\nWhen I asked him about the true value of being an actor, he revealed his enthusiasm for the career.\n\n“I can get the chance to work with the most interesting people in the world. An actor has an advantage that some people don’t have. You have the opportunity to go around the world to meet different people, you get to know different cultures. I went to Europe, then I got the chance to meet Europeans. As an actor, I always have more adventures than other people. People are nice to you only when they like you. Moreover, you’re able to control the time because it depends upon the projects you take. You can go on and go crazy for a couple of years. If you decide to take a break, then you have a couple of months to go around the world,” Peng enthused.\n\nApart from his work, Peng enjoys travelling with his family, and from his social media accounts we can often see the interesting photos he takes during these trips.\n\n“Today, I would say St. Imier is my favourite place for vacation. I went to St. Imier and took a train with my family – and the Longines headquarters and museums are [located] there! I had a great party with a bunch of interesting people there four months ago. I had amazing food and drinks there. They started drinking from noon,” he said, laughing.\n\nPreviously, he also visited Chantilly in France with the Longines ‘family.’\n\n“My trip to Chantilly was amazing. The weather was nice and the experience was quite interesting. It was my third or fourth time to go there. It was the first time I had the chance to get to know the relationship between jockey and horse. For me, it was something quite exciting. This time I went to a horse race in Chantilly; it’s very beautiful,” he said.\n\nAs an actor and ambassador of the world renowned brand, Peng’s innate class, presence and charisma are the perfect incarnation of the motto ‘Elegance is an Attitude’.\n\n“I think that elegance is an attitude. It means how you treat your life. You should know the goals that you have to achieve. If you are in the process of being there, you are focused; you know what you are doing. Your inner self sometimes expresses who you are. The difficulties you have to overcome as well as failures and experience make you a better person,” Peng explains.\n\nWrapping up the chat, Peng expressed his wishes for the coming year. Apart from slipping into more characters, he wants to spend more vacationing time with his family.\n\nDuring the event, Peng received the Official Watch of the Longines Hong Kong International Races, a model from the Record Collection, with him aspiring to become the head of the brand.\n\nIn addition to receiving this timepiece – a combination of classic elegance and excellence – Eddie Peng features in the brand’s latest TV spot, currently being broadcast throughout Asia."
