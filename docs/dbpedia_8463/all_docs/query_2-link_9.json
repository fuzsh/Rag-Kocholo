        "text": "Cover image via IMDb & South China Morning Post\n\nFollow us on Instagram, TikTok, and Telegram for the latest stories and breaking news.\n\nIt's no secret that many actors rely on stunt doubles, especially in action-packed films.\n\nTaiwanese actor Eddie Peng, however, would rather do stunts himself.\n\n41-year-old Eddie Peng is one of Asia's most prolific actors. Born in Taiwan and raised in Canada, Eddie was studying economics at the University of British Columbia, before deciding to pursue his passion in acting.\n\nAlthough his unmistakable good looks earned him a stepping stone in his acting career, it was his can-do personality and perseverance that set him off to stardom.\n\nTouted as the next Bruce Lee, he fully commits himself, and tries to perform his own stunts for every role, even if he has to spend months training for it.\n\n\"It's the only way the character will look convincing. If I'm going to rely on my stunt double for most of the moves, then I don't really see the point in taking on the role,\" he said in an interview during a movie tour prom o.\n\nAs one of the most respected idols for his dedication and powerhouse performance, Eddie has starred in many iconic roles. Here's a look at all the times he's gone above and beyond:\n\n1. Ashin — Jump Ashin! (2011)\n\nImage via IMDb\n\nEddie played the title role of Ashin, a young gymnast whose life has revolved around training since he was a young boy growing up in the small town of Yilan.\n\nThe director had initially considered selecting a professional gymnast to play Ashin, but Eddie was serious about the role, and insisted on performing the stunts himself.\n\nAs such, Eddie had to get into the shape of a professional gymnast. He trained for 12 hours a day for three months, learning stunts and gymnastic moves that transformed him into a professional who could do backflips. He also underwent a very strict diet of boiled vegetables, while avoiding all oily and salty foods.\n\n2. Lin Si Qi — Unbeatable (2013)\n\nImage via IMDb\n\nEddie also starred in action film Unbeatable, playing Lin Si Qi, a mixed martial arts fighter. Directed by Dante Lam, Unbeatable marked the beginning of many blockbusters that Eddie and the veteran director would collaborate on.\n\nIn an interview with Wall Street Journal, Eddie shared that although he had a background in boxing, he underwent six to eight hours of intense training every day for two months. Even during filming, which took around 10 hours daily, Eddie would still train to maintain his physique.\n\n3. Wong Fei Hung — Rise of the Legend (2014)\n\nThis film saw Eddie taking up martial arts to prepare for the role of Wong Fei Hung, a folk hero who joins a gang with the intention of taking it down.\n\nBased on true events, Wong Fei Hung was a famous Chinese martial artist, featured in numerous martial arts films played by veteran actors like Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and Vincent Zhao. According to JayneStars, when it was Eddie's turn to play Wong Fei Hung, Eddie revealed he was nervous to the extent that he suffered sleepless nights.\n\nNevertheless, the actor gave it his all, training 10 hours a day to prepare for his role. Filming was also physically demanding for him too. In one particular scene, the actor had to jump from a three-storey building and punch a brick wall, causing him to sprain his wrist.\n\n4. Qiu Ming — To The Fore (2015)\n\nImage via Pinterest\n\nIn this unconventional drama film that Eddie and Dante collaborated on, the actor plays a professional cyclist competing in the cutthroat world of competitive road cycling.\n\nDante had high expectations for the film. According to JayneStars, to ensure that the cast were well-prepared for their roles, Dante hired Olympic-grade cyclists as personal trainers to oversee Eddie and his co-star Carlos Chan's training.\n\nEddie practised 12 hours a day, stating that he and Carlos cycled 60 kilometres per day, eventually going up to 120 kilometres, and at one point, 200 kilometres. This was on top of various other trainings that took place. In fact, the actor's regime was so intense that he even earned qualifications for competitive racing.\n\n5. Ma Feng — Call of Heroes (2016)\n\nImage via IMDb\n\nBy the time he took this role, Eddie was no stranger to kung fu films. In Call of Heroes, however, there was one particular occasion that perfectly illustrated Eddie's professionalism and dedication.\n\nIn the film, Eddie plays a free-spirited wanderer whose fate is led by his horse, his one and only companion. He comes across a town in dire need of help, and ends up getting tangled in its mess.\n\nDuring filming, Sammo Hung, an actor-turned-action director, forced Eddie to repeat a stunt 53 times, which required Eddie to do a flying kick, while being strapped to a wire work.\n\nGetting strapped to cables for stunt scenes is normal, but many actors have shared that it can be a painful and uncomfortable experience.\n\nIn fact, Sammo was full of praise for Eddie, stating that the actor never once complained during filming.\n\n6. Gao Qian — The Rescue (2020)\n\nThe Rescue, one of the highest-grossing Chinese films of all time, marked the fourth time Eddie and Dante worked together.\n\nIt is also the film that made headlines around the world, as news about Eddie almost drowning several times while filming spread like wildfire.\n\n\"I am a good swimmer, but when you are several tens of metres underwater in water measuring six degree Celsius, it's totally different from swimming,\" said Eddie in an interview with South China Morning Post.\n\nAlthough the entire cast in the film had to do their own stunts, Eddie bore the heaviest burden, as not only did he have to film physically demanding action scenes, he also played the role of the rescue team's captain, who has a son. In fact, Eddie said filming for The Rescue — which took eight months to complete — is one of his most dangerous to date. After filming wrapped up, Eddie was afraid to swim for a long while.\n\nThese films are perfect examples that Eddie isn't only known for his good looks, but also for his dedication, passion, and determination to reach new heights.\n\nKnowing this, Maison Martell, one of the great Cognac houses, has appointed the celebrated actor as the new spokesperson for Martell Noblige.\n\nEddie's appointment commemorates the launch of the refreshed Martell Noblige bottle design, which embodies the brand's audacious spirit and slogan, 'Soar Beyond The Expected'.\n\nThe celebrated actor is known and adored for his aspiration for self-improvement and self-growth, which is in perfect alignment with the spirit of the brand. His love of embracing the unknown enables him to continuously realise his full potential, so that he can reach new heights. In short, his story perfectly encapsulates the essence of 'Soar Beyond The Expected'. It's little wonder why he is Martell Noblige's new spokesperson.\n\nA short film featuring Eddie is also released, depicting how the actor overcame the numerous arduous obstacles in his career and life. Here's a look:\n\nBoth Martell Noblige and Eddie firmly believe that even though the first step can be daunting, everyone can soar to new heights if they put their mind to it\n\nMartell Noblige consists of a minimum of 100 eaux-de-vie from four main terroirs in the Cognac region, boasting a delicate taste that showcases the Maison's focus on exceptional quality.\n\nSince its launch in the 1980s, the cognac has been a celebration of over three centuries of savoir-faire and innovation by Maison Martell.\n\nToday, with its refreshed bottle, Martell Noblige aspires to be a rallying cry that calls the young generation to be audacious, break boundaries, redefine convention, and most importantly, 'Soar Beyond The Expected'.\n\nThat's why the brand has kickstarted a series called Martell Noblige Swift Nights, which aims to bring young people around Malaysia to enjoy trendsetting and creative experiences. The event first began in Kuala Lumpur in September 2022, and continually takes place in cities around Malaysia until today. You can follow Martell's Facebook page to stay updated.\n\nYou can learn more about the brand and Eddie's collaboration here or purchase a bottle of Martell Noblige on their Shopee page\n\nAs a reminder, the legal drinking age in Malaysia is 21 years old. That means you need to be 21 and non-Muslim in order to buy and consume alcohol. Remember to always drink responsibly and in moderation. Don't drink and drive. If you plan to drink, try carpooling with a friend who isn't drinking or catch a cab instead of driving. #CelebrateResponsibly\n\nCheck out other trending stories on SAYS:"
