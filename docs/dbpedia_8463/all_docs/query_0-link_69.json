        "text": "Among the many masters in the Taiwanese New Waves, Edward Yang 楊德昌 (1947–2007) is the only one which attracted attention from such high-profile cultural critics as Fredric Jameson (born 1934), who takes Yang’s Terrorizers 恐怖分子 (1986) as an example of a “postmodern” film and offers an in-depth analysis of the film’s representation of Taipei. Its postmodernity, according to Jameson, resides in Taiwan’s special status as a “non-national nation state” and being a post-Third-World country, and Yang’s genius for making a film which negotiates between modernist and postmodernist aesthetics. Apart from Terrorizers (1986), this entry also examines Taipei Story 青梅竹馬 (1985), which is less complex in terms of narrative form, but nonetheless illuminates on Taipei as an Asian city affected by political, social, and cultural forces in the 1980s."
