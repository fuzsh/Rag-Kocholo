From schools, workplaces, or public squares in Ciego de Ávila province, the voices of men and women expressed their solidarity with the Palestinian civilian population for the constant attacks on the Gaza Strip that left substantial human losses and material damage.

Members of the Arab community of this province hold meetings to learn about the roots of the conflict and the international regulations as a sign of support for the Palestinians in their struggle for their country’s liberation.

Alexis Valdés, president of the Arab Union in this territory, reaffirmed his commitment to the Palestinian resistance and called for an immediate end to the Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip, where defenseless children and women die every day. Simultaneously, hospitals and other civilian infrastructures are being attacked.

The cultural institutions in the province recalled, in special morning assemblies, the legacy of the historic leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, about the cause of the Palestinian people and denounced Western governments’ complicity in those events. Cuba has repeatedly reaffirmed its stance on the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State in the face of the invasion and colonization promoted by Israel for more than seven decades.
