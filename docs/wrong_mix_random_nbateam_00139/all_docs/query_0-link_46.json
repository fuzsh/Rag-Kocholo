A deeply spiritual, cerebral powerhouse. A famously outspoken introvert. For her millions of fans, and the few unacquainted, defining rock luminary Alanis Morissette is an exercise in dichotomies and nuance. And though her most formidable traits are seemingly at odds with one another, they are, oddly enough, completely emblematic of all of us: complex, conflicting, and, most importantly, ever evolving.\n\nBut here’s the rub: We don’t like our pop stars that way! Especially when they’re 21, and female, and it’s still the mid-'90s. In her courageously raw and musically rich Words + Music, the inimitable Alanis Morissette draws us right into that central supposed paradox as she opens up about the lifelong process of discovering that her voice is, in fact, composed of a multitude of voices. And despite external forces teaching her to sublimate certain ones as a child (anger, sadness, fear) and later, cultural forces demanding she oughta stick to one as a persona, Alanis has come out on the other side with a sense of peace and gratitude for her - only human - chorus of coexisting internal voices.\n\nWith her striking command of language and profound emotional fluency, the now 46-year-old covers an enormous amount of personal ground with listeners, unpacking a lifetime of conscious self-discovery in an evocative rumination on her journey as an artist, celebrity, and woman. Listen closely as Alanis weaves her fascinating, funny, at times painful autobiographical story between eight of her most anthemic/kick-ass tracks. If you’re looking for Alanis to perform enthralling new versions of songs like “You Oughta Know”, “Ironic”, “Thank U”, or “Hand in My Pocket”, matched with compelling detail about the tunes and her creative process - well, you’re in the right place. And if you’re looking for Alanis to delve even deeper: to mine, examine, and ultimately make sense of seminal moments in her life as a means to inspire and enlighten your own? Grab your earbuds - you’ll be vastly rewarded!\n\nBy the end of her captivating session an impressive truth emerges: While most of us do soul search, only the rarest among us have the courage and discipline to actually cultivate what we discover. Alanis Morissette is such an example, willing to constantly listen to herself and respond in kind. After shaking up the world 25 years ago with Jagged Little Pill, hear her today as she continues to reach new heights - this time by revealing the range of her own humanity to help connect us with ours.\n\nExperience this title in immersive 3D audio by [setting your download quality to High] within the app. Headphones recommended.

A serial killer.\n\nA small town ready to combust.\n\nTitus Crown is the first Black sheriff in the history of Charon County, Virginia. In recent decades, quiet Charon has had only two murders. But after years of working as an FBI agent, Titus knows better than anyone that while his hometown might seem like a land of moonshine, cornbread, and honeysuckle, secrets always fester under the surface.\n\nThen a year to the day after Titus’s election, a school teacher is killed by a former student and the student is fatally shot by Titus’s deputies. As Titus investigates the shootings, he unearths terrible crimes and a serial killer who has been hiding in plain sight, haunting the dirt lanes and woodland clearings of Charon.\n\nWith the killer’s possible connections to a local church and the town’s harrowing history weighing on him, Titus projects confidence about closing the case while concealing a painful secret from his own past. At the same time, he also has to contend with a far-right group that wants to hold a parade in celebration of the town’s Confederate history.\n\nCharon is Titus’s home and his heart. But where faith and violence meet, there will be a reckoning.\n\nA Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books.\n\nAmerican Football is the untold tale of the rough-and-tumble origins of the National Football League. Produced and presented by Michael Strahan and narrated by actress and pro football enthusiast Kate Mara, this podcast reaches back into the past to explain the dirty, bloody, and tumultuous beginnings of America's most popular sport.\n\nBorn from the grassroots of Middle America in the early 20th century, football exploded in popularity but quickly became rife with class conflict both on the field and off. Together, new immigrants and the American underclass fought to play a brand-new sport that defined the American spirit but was controlled by the American elite.\n\nAmerican Football is a fast-paced tale about the creation of the game as it transitions from an amateur sport defined by drama and corruption to one of the most premier leagues in the world. The central figures in this story, some famous and some forgotten, drive forward this drama series that mirrors American history.\n\nFrom The HISTORY® Channel, SMAC Entertainment, and Misher Films, American Football brings together today’s greatest players, coaches, and personalities to explore the history of the sport. It features a unique play-by-play format that recreates classic games using the renowned voices of our modern era. Listen as each episode introduces us to the extraordinary heroes whose dreams and desires shaped football into what it is today.\n\nPlease note: This content is not for kids.

Discretion is advised, except for 42-year-olds (you’re all good).\n\nFrom the Emmy-winning creators at Conan O’Brien’s production company Team Coco, A Total Switch Show is an outrageous comedy starring real-life mother and daughter Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) and Zoey Deutch (The Politician) playing a mother and daughter who switch bodies. This NSFW nod to classic films like Freaky Friday gets extra freaky twist after twist, episode after episode. And it boasts an all-star cast, featuring Bradley Whitford, Giancarlo Esposito, Bobby Moynihan, Judy Greer, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Sasheer Zamata, Mitra Jouhari, and more.\n\nGripped by a global body-swap phenomenon, Emma (Deutch), a go-nowhere daughter, and Lisa (Thompson), a micro-managing mom, wake one morning to see they’ve switched bodies and become \"Switchies.\" Already at each other’s throats, this dysfunctional duo desperately try to find their way back into their own bodies.\n\nAlong the way, they manage to screw up each other’s lives while taking the family - a bumbling dad (Whitford) and weirdo little brother (Moynihan) - as well as Emma’s sword-obsessed boyfriend (Mintz-Plasse) along for the ride. Hold tight as they get caught up in an anti-Switchie riot, star in a trashy reality show, and much more. The only people who can help them seem to be the mysterious federal agents at the Switchie Protection Program. When the switch hits the fan, listen to see who can be trusted and who’s got a dirty secret in this maniacal mother-daughter mix-up.\n\nChief Inspector Armand Gamache returns in the eighteenth book in #1 New York Times bestseller Louise Penny's beloved series.\n\nIt’s spring and Three Pines is reemerging after the harsh winter. But not everything buried should come alive again. Not everything lying dormant should reemerge.\n\nBut something has.\n\nAs the villagers prepare for a special celebration, Armand Gamache and Jean-Guy Beauvoir find themselves increasingly worried. A young man and woman have reappeared in the Sûreté du Québec investigators’ lives after many years. The two were young children when their troubled mother was murdered, leaving them damaged, shattered. Now they’ve arrived in the village of Three Pines.\n\nBut to what end?\n\nGamache and Beauvoir’s memories of that tragic case, the one that first brought them together, come rushing back. Did their mother’s murder hurt them beyond repair? Have those terrible wounds, buried for decades, festered and are now about to erupt?\n\nAs Chief Inspector Gamache works to uncover answers, his alarm grows when a letter written by a long dead stone mason is discovered. In it the man describes his terror when bricking up an attic room somewhere in the village. Every word of the 160-year-old letter is filled with dread. When the room is found, the villagers decide to open it up.\n\nAs the bricks are removed, Gamache, Beauvoir and the villagers discover a world of curiosities. But the head of homicide soon realizes there’s more in that room than meets the eye. There are puzzles within puzzles, and hidden messages warning of mayhem and revenge.\n\nIn unsealing that room, an old enemy is released into their world. Into their lives. And into the very heart of Armand Gamache’s home.\n\nA Macmillan Audio production from Minotaur Books.\n\n“I’m an instrument, stay in tune with me.”\n\nIn a performance that combines the personal and poetic with the literary and the lyrical, Grammy, Oscar, Emmy, and Golden Globe-winning artist Common spins something entirely new and bold for both his old-school fans and those new to one of hip-hop’s most essential voices. This is Bluebird Memories, part of Audible's Words + Music that blends storytelling, music, and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience.\n\nWritten and conceived by Common with Awoye Timpo and NSangou Njikam, originally recorded live at the Minetta Lane Theatre in New York City, and backed by a world-class band including special guest appearance by Robert Glasper and an ensemble of vocalists, Bluebird Memories tracks Common’s intimate journey from childhood to manhood. At its heart, it serves as both an open letter to his estranged father and a personal meditation on the quest for greater self-understanding, self-worth, and connection to the world that surrounds him.\n\nAs a young artist, introduced to the work of literary icons from James Baldwin and Gwendolyn Brooks to Rakim and Melle Mel, Common would grow to use their works as motivation and a high-water mark for what would become his life in words. In a performance that recounts stories about growing up in Chicago, discovering hip-hop, longing for a consistent father, and his awakening into Black consciousness, the evolution of Common, as son, as man, artist, and activist, is all here - unpacked and laid bare.\n\nAt just under two hours, Bluebird Memories is constantly in motion, soaring with emotion and pulsing with raw vitality. Seamlessly blending, stretching, and playing with forms, Common slides between poetry and candid conversation, kicks into one of his classic tracks, and backs out into a moment of nearly silent reflection. For those hip-hop heads, the treat of hearing Common bounce between bars of his own self-admitted cringey party raps to rapturously reciting classic hip-hop’s most revered verses is a joy to behold. (Yes, bumping human beatbox included.) In a performance that calls forth the spirit and legacy of so many artists, thinkers, and heroes who informed both his artistry and personal philosophy, Common invites listeners to experience him in his totality. A finely tuned instrument capable of conveying a sweeping breadth of power, range, and tone. Listen to a modern icon deliver at the top of his craft.\n\nOne summer. Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming...\n\nNora Stephens' life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby.\n\nWhich is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina, for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute.\n\nIf Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.\n\n“When I become mayor, we become mayor.”\n\nRas Baraka’s famous words speak to exactly who he is as a leader - a fiercely loyal member of his community. In this innovative and ground-breaking Audible Original, hear how Baraka - the mayor of Newark, New Jersey - grew from spoken-word artist to school principal to successful politician. Mixing prose and poetry, musical interludes and powerful soliloquies, Ras explores his life in-depth, including stories about his father, poet Amiri Baraka, and his personal encounters with jazz singer Nina Simone and hip-hop superstar Lauryn Hill - who famously featured him on her debut album. This is the story of how one man found his voice - and how each of us can find our own calling.\n\nBaraka’s story begins at home in Newark. He was raised in a house of art and politics, passion and provocation. His father was one of the most influential and controversial poets of the 1970s and filled his home with ardent activists, lively debates, and conversations unlike any on his block - a powerful combination that influences him to this day.\n\nBaraka’s story is a deeply personal history that reflects a generation and a movement, vividly capturing a tumultuous period of political and social struggle and ultimately, boundless hope and renewal. The tale is co-authored by acclaimed writer Jelani Cobb, a staff writer at The New Yorker and a professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Experience this exclusive, first-of-its kind telling of Baraka's journey from poet to principal to peacemaker, through his own powerful, inspiring words.\n\nSpecial thanks for the use of \"Newark: The Slow Road Back\"\n\nWritten and Produced by Sandra King\n\n1987.\n\nAuthor: Ras Baraka\n\nAuthor: Jelani Cobb\n\nAssociate Producer: Rachel Pilgrim\n\nAssociate Producer: Aja Simpson\n\nCast: Ras Baraka, Jelani Cobb\n\nComposer: Stefon Harris\n\nEditor: Julie Piñero\n\nExecutive Producer: Christopher John Farley\n\nExecutive Producer: Julie Piñero\n\nExecutive Producer: The New Jersey Performing Arts Center\n\nSound Design, Mix & Master: Maxwell Smith\n\nAcquisition and Development: Louise Quayle\n\nVP of Audible Studios: Mike Charzuk\n\nEditor-in-Chief, Audible Original Publishing: David Blum\n\nThe number one New York Times best-selling story about American Olympic triumph in Nazi Germany, the inspiration for the PBS documentary The Boys of '36, broadcast to coincide with the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 80th anniversary of the boys' gold medal race.\n\nFor readers/listeners of Unbroken, out of the depths of the Depression comes an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times - the improbable, intimate account of how nine working-class boys from the American West showed the world at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin what true grit really meant. It was an unlikely quest from the start. With a team composed of the sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the University of Washington’s eight-oar crew team was never expected to defeat the elite teams of the East Coast and Great Britain, yet they did, going on to shock the world by defeating the German team rowing for Adolf Hitler. The emotional heart of the tale lies with Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not only to regain his shattered self-regard but also to find a real place for himself in the world. Drawing on the boys’ own journals and vivid memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, Brown has created an unforgettable portrait of an era, a celebration of a remarkable achievement, and a chronicle of one extraordinary young man’s personal quest.\n\n\"I’m James Taylor and I’m a professional autobiographer\", says the celebrated folk singer at the start of this tender audio memoir. Through decades of music by one of the best-selling musicians of all time, who created classics like \"Fire and Rain\" and \"Carolina in My Mind\", James Taylor has doled out his history in the poetry of his work. Taylor says his early life is, \"the source of many of my songs\", and Break Shot is a tour of his first 21 years in rich, new detail. Praised by Forbes magazine as going \"beyond the spoken word\", Break Shot combines storytelling, music and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience. Longtime fans will savor a crop of musical gems, including an unreleased recording of the beloved hymn \"Jerusalem\", selections from his newest release American Standard, as well as new original scoring by Taylor specially recorded for Break Shot and more from the Grammy Award-winning artist.\n\nRecorded in his home studio, The Barn in western Massachusetts, Taylor tells the deeply personal story of his youth, which is entwined with the story of his family. What started as an idyllic tight unit soon became a family sent to different emotional corners - like a break shot in the game of pool, he says, when you slam the cue ball into the fifteen other balls and they all go flying off. By the time Taylor released his breakout second album in 1970, Sweet Baby James, he had seen the disintegration of his parents’ marriage and his family crumble in the aftermath. He had committed himself twice to a psychiatric hospital, battled depression, a heroin addiction, suffered a relapse, and traveled far away from the wood smoke and moonshine of the North Carolina landscapes in which he came of age. Despite it all, he was also on the cusp of super-stardom and on his way to bringing light and joy to millions. He was 21.\n\nJourney with James Taylor to a time before he became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors and both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Arts - and a beloved voice to millions.\n\nIn a genre-redefining first, Breakthrough bursts onto the singing competition scene with an electrifying, audio-only series that strips away the superficial to reaffirm what matters most: pure talent. The captivating new Audible Original invites listeners on an intimate musical journey where it doesn't matter what you look like or who you know, just how you sound. Based solely on what they hear, expert celebrity judges Kelly Rowland (Destiny’s Child, The X Factor) and Sara Bareilles (Waitress, Into the Woods, Girls5eva) coach and evaluate five undiscovered artists as host Daveed Diggs (Hamilton, Blindspotting, The Little Mermaid) leads competitors through a series of high-stakes singing and songwriting challenges for one top spot.\n\nAs musically gifted as they are artistically unique, each finalist is driven by the same dream: to become music’s next must-listen. But to break through, they’ll have to dig deep, pushing their vocal, songwriting, and recording chops to their absolute limits while keeping their feet (and emotions) firmly grounded. With Kelly and Sara leading the way, each contestant will discover just how bright their star can shine as they remind each of us that pure talent is never just a shot in the dark.\n\nListen to all of the songs from Breakthrough on Amazon Music or wherever you get your music: https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0C7SCDZN1\n\nThis is an Audible Original, produced by At Will Media.\n\nHow did hip-hop happen? To understand that, we have to go back to before the ‘birth’ of the culture.\n\nIt wasn’t a given that the Bronx of the late 1960s and early 1970s would be the birthplace of an American art form. Urban renewal had left the borough neglected and in crisis. Gangs policed the streets, and winding up in the wrong territory could have serious consequences. But things were about to change.\n\nCan You Dig It? is an in-depth history of how positive community influences helped inspire the troubled youth to end the cycle of gang violence, as told by people who were there at the time. It’s the inspiring true story of how local gang the Ghetto Brothers rejected calls for war in the aftermath of the murder of Black Benjie - a member who was trying to find common ground - and how gang leaders Yellow Benjy and Karate Charlie worked to broker a peace with rivals. The end result? A place where urban artistry could flourish into a global culture 50 years strong: hip-hop.\n\nNarrated by Public Enemy’s Chuck D and told through a blend of immersive reenactments, oral history and expert discussion, Can You Dig It? is as illuminating for hip-hop fans as it is for history buffs, as one of the great American stories. It’s a tribute not just to community action but to the unsung heroes who paved the way for greatness.\n\n\"Racism is a disease of white people, and I don't intend to be quiet about it.\" (Albert Einstein)\n\n“I agree with Einstein about that, and I don't intend to be quiet about it either.” (T Bone Burnett)\n\nLegendary Grammy Award-winning producer and towering musical icon T Bone Burnett speaks plainly, which is all the more reason why his stunning new Words + Music, The Confederacy: Truth and Reconciliation, lands with such force. And his songs, delivered straight from the heart, carry with them the weight of unvarnished truth and the wisdom he’s gathered from a lifetime.\n\nThrough performance of his own words and music, in just a little more than 90 minutes runtime, T Bone confronts the choking influence of white supremacy in the United States - from its inception to its current state - reckoning with the musical, political, and personal influences that have shaped his career and his understanding of the human spirit in America. Part history, part personal essay, it is above all a call to action: to reject white supremacy and reconcile our nation’s racist past.\n\nDelivered in his steadfast, gritty voice, T Bone’s meticulously crafted prose recounts the horrors of our nation’s history, its far-reaching, systematic oppression of African Americans to this day, the delusion of grandeur much of Anglo-America still suffers from, and the critical need for personal and societal change if we are to redeem ourselves in any capacity - and survive as a people. All of this T Bone lays bare, not by high-and-mighty finger pointing but through a sense of shared destiny and faith in each other. T Bone’s Words + Music is an honest hand reaching out for ours, urging us to grapple through this, mindfully, together. His words are further punctuated by his own heart-rending music, seamlessly woven in and out of his storytelling, and building upon his open plea. Each song, including “River of Love”, “Quicksand”, and “Hefner and Disney”, is thoughtfully plucked from his prolific catalog.\n\nAs T Bone connects the dots for us using well-established facts, personal experience, and skillful songwriting, we are drawn to a resounding truth: that although our past is undeniably paved with unspeakable ills, they must be spoken; denying it only compounds the problem. As T Bone rightly concludes, we are all at a difficult crossroads. But his solution could not resonate any clearer: the path forward requires a hard look within. Join T Bone Burnett and listen to his call.\n\n“Let's make a future where we all want to live.”\n\n“Let's make a past we don't have to forgive.”\n\n(T Bone Burnett)\n\nOPRAH’S BOOK CLUB PICK • INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • SUBJECT OF A SIX-PART SUPER SOUL PODCAST SERIES HOSTED BY OPRAH WINFREY\n\nFrom the New York Times-bestselling author of Cutting for Stone comes a stunning and magisterial epic of love, faith, and medicine, set in Kerala, South India, following three generations of a family seeking the answers to a strange secret\n\n“One of the best books I’ve read in my entire life. It’s epic. It’s transportive . . . It was unputdownable!”—Oprah Winfrey, OprahDaily.com\n\nThe Covenant of Water is the long-awaited new novel by Abraham Verghese, the author of the major word-of-mouth bestseller Cutting for Stone, which has sold over 1.5 million copies in the United States alone and remained on the New York Times bestseller list for over two years.\n\nSpanning the years 1900 to 1977, The Covenant of Water is set in Kerala, on South India’s Malabar Coast, and follows three generations of a family that suffers a peculiar affliction: in every generation, at least one person dies by drowning—and in Kerala, water is everywhere. At the turn of the century, a twelve-year-old girl from Kerala’s long-existing Christian community, grieving the death of her father, is sent by boat to her wedding, where she will meet her forty-year-old husband for the first time. From this unforgettable new beginning, the young girl—and future matriarch, known as Big Ammachi—will witness unthinkable changes over the span of her extraordinary life, full of joy and triumph as well as hardship and loss, her faith and love the only constants.\n\nA shimmering evocation of a bygone India and of the passage of time itself, The Covenant of Water is a hymn to progress in medicine and to human understanding, and a humbling testament to the difficulties undergone by past generations for the sake of those alive today. It is one of the most masterful literary novels published in recent years.\n\nBeck’s story begins when the curiosity of a young loner leads him to explore and discover a series of magical places that shape the architecture of his personal and creative identities: a public library, a community college, an artistic community in a desolate section of a long since disappeared L.A. He seeks out and happens upon mentors and trials, allies and enemies, and discovers a birthright to an artistic legacy that connects his family to Andy Warhol, the beat poets, and the Velvet Underground. Inspired, Beck sets out on his own creative path, a modern version of the classic hero’s journey.\n\nThese are his Words + Music.\n\nA true musical polymath, Beck shifts between and blends genres and generations with a preternatural ease—one foot in the secret history of American music and the other moving toward the future. Consistently brushed off by industry gatekeepers on both coasts, Beck perseveres—ultimately building a bespoke audience of millions who share his borderless musical vision.\n\nThe music included in Dear Life spans Beck’s entire career and mirrors his always ongoing and never predictable creative evolution. Beck returns to some of his most important songs— “Loser,” “Where It’s At,” “Lost Cause,” and many more—with fresh context and insights provided by decades of experience. In Dear Life, Beck proves that the most powerful art is made by those who are brave enough to be fully themselves.\n\nWinner of the 2023 Audie Award for Best Male Narrator\n\nA #1 New York Times Bestseller and New York Times Book Review Editors’ Choice!\n\nLegendary storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher—for that world or ours.\n\nCharlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself—and his dad. When Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds emerge from it.\n\nCharlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe. What Bowditch knows, and has kept secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is a portal to another world.\n\nMagnificent, terrifying, and “spellbinding…packed with glorious flights of imagination and characteristic tenderness about childhood, Fairy Tale is vintage King at his finest” (Esquire).\n\n“Good, evil, a kingdom to save, monsters to slay—these are the stuff that page-turners are made from.”—Laura Miller, Slate\n\nSelected by New York Magazine as one of the most anticipated summer podcast listens of 2023.\n\nIn 1984, as a New York City subway train made its way downtown, a white man named Bernhard Goetz shot four unarmed Black teenagers he believed were going to rob him. The shooting and its aftermath came to embody the widespread fear of crime that reigned supreme around the country during the 1980s.\n\nThe twist: Goetz became a cause célèbre, a folk hero to many who declared they were sick and tired of crime. His vigilantism was applauded, while his victims - Darrell Cabey, Troy Canty, Barry Allen, and James Ramseur - were marginalized and attacked in the press. This six-part series offers a panoramic but intimate view of how this era-defining story unfolded, giving voice for the first time to key players, and immersing listeners in the gritty, paranoid world of ‘80s New York City.\n\nFrom the co-creators of Slow Burn, Fiasco is a narrative podcast that transports listeners back to the day-to-day reality of America’s most pivotal historical events. Using original interviews and archival footage, host Leon Neyfakh brings to life the forgotten twists and turns of the past while shedding light on the present day. This propulsive examination of history urges us all to re-think not only the events that change us, but how we are changed by these moments.\n\nEnter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders from USA Today bestselling author Rebecca Yarros.\n\nTwenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders.\n\nBut when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away … because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.\n\nWith fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.\n\nShe’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.\n\nYet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom’s protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.\n\nFriends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out: graduate or die.\n\nPlease note: This Audible Original contains explicit content and language some people may find offensive.

Discretion is advised.\n\nTake a deep dive into the personal and political lives of six trailblazing Black comedy icons with your host comedian/actor JB Smoove (Curb Your Enthusiasm). This engaging docuseries shows you how these fearless heroes of comedy broke color barriers and challenged the racist status quo, all while making audiences roar with laughter. Without them, we wouldn’t have the superstars we have today.\n\nProduced by Team Coco, AYR Media and Toni Judkins, each episode of Funny My Way: Breaking Boundaries in Black Comedy presents a comedy great of the past: Paul Mooney (known as “The Godfather of Comedy”), Flip Wilson (the first Black entertainer to host a successful weekly variety show on network TV), Moms Mabley (the first Black comedian to play Carnegie Hall), Dick Gregory (the first Black comedian to break the color line in the nightclub scene), Rudy Ray Moore (known as “The Godfather of Rap”), and Redd Foxx (known as “The Dean of X-rated comedians”).\n\nThrough funny and moving archival footage, their stories are told alongside incisive commentary from various popular comics, political commentators, and legendary creators, including Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley, Godfrey, RuPaul, Margaret Cho, Deon Cole, Sandra Bernhard, Norman Lear, and more. Hear how these Black comedy legends made it to the top and influenced so many by doing it their way.\n\nIf any artist could brag about his contribution to the pop culture canon, it’s Smokey Robinson. His career is filled with so many “he was there” moments it’s a wonder he doesn’t recall them with the swagger of a conquering hero: songwriting and singing as a teenager in Detroit; co-founding Motown Records with Berry Gordy; creating 26 Top 40 hits with his group The Miracles; helping to spark racial integration of popular music in the 1960s; discovering hitmakers like Diana Ross and the Supremes; penning tunes for a jaw-droppingly diverse group of artists including Marvin Gaye, The Beatles, The Jackson Five, Kim Carnes, Linda Ronstadt; and releasing smash hits as solo artist well into the 1980s.\n\nBut surprisingly, and delightfully, Robinson is as awed by his success as we are listening to him describe it. He guides us through his extraordinary career with the same giddy sense of discovery and delight that music fans recall the first time they heard one of his infectious tunes.\n\nHe takes us back to his group’s first, disastrous performance at the Apollo Theater, opening for a brilliant and generous Ray Charles. He describes daily life at the famed Hitsville studio in Detroit, where a young Diana Ross or Martha Reeves could be found working as the receptionist. He shares his pride in being an influence on the Beatles and hearing his songs on their album - a transforming moment for the Motown sound. “I ain't never heard no popular white boys say anything like that ever. For them to come out and tell the world? They were my guys from then on.”\n\nAnd, of course, he takes us inside his songs. He describes where he was - shaving in the mirror at home - when “The Tracks of My Tears” finally came together. He remembers taking the wheel on the last 150 miles back to Detroit after a tour, humming the melody that would become the Temptations hit “The Way You Do the Things You Do.” He recalls being floored by the way a 10-year-old Michael Jackson brought a depth and soul to “Who’s Loving You.” And he explains where the term “Quiet Storm” originated, a song title that went on to become an entire musical genre.\n\nIt’s a journey Robinson revisits with a grateful, humble heart. He has no agenda to push, no axes to grind, no scores to settle. He reflects on the ups as well as downs, and looks back with appreciation for the people who put love in his life. That makes listening a distinct pleasure: You get to spend time with a hugely influential artist who is warm, upbeat, and proud to have built a life and career through his art.\n\nIn 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the foundations for a new development, the last thing they expected to find was a skeleton at the bottom of a well. Who the skeleton was and how it got there were two of the long-held secrets kept by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side and shared ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Moshe integrated his theater and where Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state came looking for a deaf boy to institutionalize him, it was Chona and Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe’s theater and the unofficial leader of the Black community on Chicken Hill, who worked together to keep the boy safe.\n\nAs these characters’ stories overlap and deepen, it becomes clear how much the people who live on the margins of white, Christian America struggle and what they must do to survive. When the truth is finally revealed about what happened on Chicken Hill and the part the town’s white establishment played in it, McBride shows us that even in dark times, it is love and community—heaven and earth—that sustain us.\n\nBringing his masterly storytelling skills and his deep faith in humanity to The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store, James McBride has written a novel as compassionate as Deacon King Kong and as inventive as The Good Lord Bird.\n\nThe #1 New York Times bestselling author of Think Again illuminates how we can elevate ourselves and others to unexpected heights.\n\nWe live in a world that’s obsessed with talent. We celebrate gifted students in school, natural athletes in sports, and child prodigies in music. But admiring people who start out with innate advantages leads us to overlook the distance we ourselves can travel. We underestimate the range of skills that we can learn and how good we can become. We can all improve at improving. And when opportunity doesn’t knock, there are ways to build a door.\n\nHidden Potential offers a new framework for raising aspirations and exceeding expectations. Adam Grant weaves together groundbreaking evidence, surprising insights, and vivid storytelling that takes us from the classroom to the boardroom, the playground to the Olympics, and underground to outer space. He shows that progress depends less on how hard you work than how well you learn. Growth is not about the genius you possess—it’s about the character you develop. Grant explores how to build the character skills and motivational structures to realize our own potential, and how to design systems that create opportunities for those who have been underrated and overlooked.\n\nMany writers have chronicled the habits of superstars who accomplish great things. This book reveals how anyone can rise to achieve greater things. The true measure of your potential is not the height of the peak you’ve reached, but how far you’ve climbed to get there.\n\nFeaturing Maurice Ashley, William DeMerritt, R.A.

Our ideas about dying are confusing at best: Will our memories flash before our eyes? Regrets consume our thoughts? Does a bright light appear at the end of a tunnel? For most people, it will be a slower process, one eased with preparedness, good humor, and a bit of faith. At the forefront of changing attitudes around palliative care is hospice nurse Hadley Vlahos, who shows that end-of-life care can teach us just as much about how to live as it does about how we die.\n\nVlahos was raised in a strict religious household, but began questioning her beliefs in high school after the sudden death of a friend. When she got pregnant at nineteen, she was shunned by her community and enrolled herself in nursing school to be able to support herself and her baby. But nursing soon became more than a job: when she focused on palliative care and hospice work, it became a calling.\n\nIn The In-Between, Vlahos recounts the most impactful experiences she’s had with the people she’s worked with—from the woman who never once questioned her faith until she was close to death, to the older man seeing visions of his late daughter, to the young patient who laments that she spent too much of her short life worrying about what others thought of her—while also sharing her own fascinating journey.\n\nWritten with profound insight, humility, and respect, The In-Between is a heartrending memoir that shows how caring for others can transform a life while also offering wisdom and comfort for those dealing with loss and providing inspiration for how to live now.\n\nOverwhelmed by conflicting narratives and sensationalism in the news?

Every woman he dates goes on to find their soul mate the second they break up. When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll both go on to find the love of their lives. It’s a bonkers idea… and it just might work.\n\nEmma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse would be in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka.\n\nIt's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma's toxic mother shows up and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they're suddenly navigating a lot more than they expected—including catching real feelings for each other. What if this time Fate has actually brought the perfect pair together?\n\n#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A twisting, haunting true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history, from the author of The Wager and The Lost City of Z, “one of the preeminent adventure and true-crime writers working today.\"—New York Magazine • NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST • SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE\n\n“A shocking whodunit…What more could fans of true-crime thrillers ask?”—USA Today\n\n“A masterful work of literary journalism crafted with the urgency of a mystery.” —The Boston Globe\n\nIn the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.\n\nThen, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.\n\nAs the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.\n\nLook for David Grann’s latest bestselling book, The Wager!\n\nLife is finally looking up for 28 year old Shayla -- She’s got a great boyfriend and is about to start her dream writing job.

After a chance encounter with the world’s most popular K-pop idol, Youngjae, she decides to chase the fantasy and heads for South Korea in the hopes of kindling a relationship with the star.\n\nThere are a lot of ups —beautiful city, amazing food, dynamic culture and K-pop music everywhere, plus a new friend in Dal, an ex-idol with a chip on his shoulder who owns the 7-11 she lives above. But there are also downs — culture clashes, difficulty with the language, and Youngjae is a lot more popular than she realized. She likely isn’t going to just bump into on the streets of Seoul!\n\nMoving to Korea might have been a mistake, but Shayla’s committed to see it through. With time running out on her 90-day visa she enlists an exasperated Dal to help her reconnect with Youngjae, but will their friendship become something more as he helps her chase her Y/N dreams?\n\nStarring Susan Wokoma and Daniel Henney, with MeeWha Alana Lee, Amerjit Deu, Edward Hong, Joomin Hwang, Seong-Jae Kong, Hester Jean Lee, Jennifer Kim, Shawn Kim (aka Kim Goo), Lorna Laidlaw, Elsie Lovelock, Jessica Lee, Rae Lim, Helen Madelyn Kim, Eurie Nam, Jun Noh, J Sebastian Lee, Jennifer Sun Bell, Minje Sung, Marta Svetek, George Weightman, Clare Wille, MiJi Yi and June Yoon\n\nNow available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.\n\nA NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER with 5+ hours of bonus material not found in the print version and read by Leslie Jones.

I’m excited to share my story with you.\n\nNow, I’m gonna be honest: Some of the details might be vague because a b*tch is fifty-five and she’s smoked a ton of weed. But while bits might be a touch hazy, I can promise you the underlying truth is REAL. Whether I’m talking about my childhood growing up in the South, my early stand-up days driving from gig to gig through the darkest parts of our country and praying I wouldn’t get murdered, what Chris Rock told Lorne Michaels, that time I wanted to shoot Whoopi Goldberg on SNL, and yeah, I’ll tell you all about Ghostbusters and the nudes and Supermarket Sweep and The Daily Show . . .

It makes sense. With the COVID-19 Pandemic a lot of the things that we’d taken for granted were lost in an instant, and that included concerts. And as the world rebounds from the Pandemic’s darkest days, people are yearning for the connection that only Live performance can bring.\n\nLike many of you, while waiting for a return to something that felt like normalcy, acclaimed music writer Corbin Reiff revisited some of his all-time favorite Live performances from the past.

In this eight-episode Audible Original we’ll dive deep into the most mind-blowing concerts ever performed.

No matter—she throws herself with gusto into her work as a hotel maid. Her unique character, along with her obsessive love of cleaning and proper etiquette, make her an ideal fit for the job.

But much more than that, it’s a story about our unusual friendship, my struggle to learn who Mandela really was, and my quest to understand what makes a human being great.”\n\nMandela: The Lost Tapes provides an intimate look at who Nelson Mandela was beyond his carefully curated public persona. Through Mandela’s own words, he reveals his extraordinary journey to becoming one of the greatest leaders in modern history.\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic future, Marvel's Wastelanders: Star-Lord finds Peter Quill (Saif Ali Khan) and Rocket (Vrajesh Hirjee) a little paunchier, a little slower, and a lot saltier than they were during the glory days of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

She spent just twenty-four hours in her early twenties with the aggravatingly attractive, idealistic artist, a chance encounter that spiraled into a daylong adventure in the city. The timing was wrong, but their connection was undeniable: they shared every secret, every dream, and made a pact to meet one year later. Fern showed up. Will didn’t.\n\nAt thirty-two, Fern’s life doesn’t look at all how she once imagined it would. Instead of living in the city, Fern’s back home, running her mother’s lakeside resort—something she vowed never to do. The place is in disarray, her ex-boyfriend’s the manager, and Fern doesn’t know where to begin.\n\nShe needs a plan—a lifeline. To her surprise, it comes in the form of Will, who arrives nine years too late, with a suitcase in tow and an offer to help on his lips. Will may be the only person who understands what Fern’s going through. But how could she possibly trust this expensive-suit wearing mirage who seems nothing like the young man she met all those years ago. Will is hiding something, and Fern’s not sure she wants to know what it is.\n\nBut ten years ago, Will Baxter rescued Fern. Can she do the same for him?\n\nThe first Olympic women's marathon and the battle for the right to run\n\nOn August 5, 1984, millions of people around the world watched the first ever women’s Olympic marathon live on ABC. Until this day, women had never been allowed to run even a mile at the Games, much less a marathon. When Joan Benoit Samuelson broke away from the lead pack at mile 3, it was a shocker. No runner had ever attacked so early and won an Olympic marathon. But on August 5th, there were a lot of firsts.\n\nThe history of women’s distance running is a largely untold story of triumph over discrimination. For much of the 20th century, America’s cinder tracks and open roads became unlikely battlegrounds for a handful of pioneering women runners who broke the gender barrier in races, showing that women can be athletes too, and helped to advance women’s civil rights. But the Olympics were a last barrier for female distance runners, making the first women’s marathon at the Games a major milestone. In fact, US marathons had been open to women for only a decade. And before that, women in the US were prohibited from competing in runs of more than a few miles. Before that, they were hardly even allowed on the track.\n\nThis is the story of Joan Benoit Samuelson’s incredible journey to the Olympics and of the other women who paved the way and competed against her, whose passion for running also became a race for equality - and change - that continues today. Joan has run over 160,000 miles in her life… and counting.\n\nMiles to Go. *MILES TO GO is being released in honor of Women’s History Month, and on the 50th Anniversary of the 1972 passage of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nElizabeth Banks believes that sex education is a lifelong pursuit that when done well, has the power to transform lives and society itself. My Body, My Podcast is her continuing education class and she would love you to join.\n\nIn My Body, My Podcast, Banks seamlessly mixes autobiography and information to create an open space to talk about all things sex and sexuality. Throughout, you’ll hear personal stories from Banks’ life - her traumatic first period, an inappropriate meeting with a Hollywood agent, watching a PBS documentary at age eight that showed sperm swimming toward an egg inside a real human body. In telling these stories, Banks unearths important and difficult questions: Why are young people separated by gender during sex ed? What is intimate justice? How do women take control of their pleasure? Can we break the cycle of generational shame? And how on earth do we talk to kids and young people about all of this?\n\nShe turns to guests close to the subject matter - therapists, researchers, activists, parents, and friends - to get some answers. Guests like Laverne Cox, Chelsea VonChaz, Dr. Amy Schalet, Peggy Orenstein, Lindy West, Jameela Jamil, Nadia Bolz-Weber, and Pidgeon Pagonis offer vital and refreshing insight. The result is six intimate yet universal episodes of storytelling and conversation that explore new ways to approach body image, menstrual dignity, the effect of shame on our sexual psyche, the way gender categories impact all of us, and more. Of course, Banks does all of this in her quintessential style - smart, playful, and honest, meaning you can expect both some hard truths and some hard laughs.\n\nSo come on in. We’re talking about life, sex, and the pursuit of pleasure. Nothing is off limits, and all are welcome.\n\nFrom the #1 New York Times bestselling author known for her “superb pacing, twisted characters, and captivating prose” (BuzzFeed), Lisa Jewell returns with a scintillating new psychological thriller about a woman who finds herself the subject of her own popular true crime podcast.\n\nCelebrating her forty-fifth birthday at her local pub, popular podcaster Alix Summer crosses paths with an unassuming woman called Josie Fair. Josie, it turns out, is also celebrating her forty-fifth birthday. They are, in fact, birthday twins.\n\nA few days later, Alix and Josie bump into each other again, this time outside Alix’s children’s school. Josie has been listening to Alix’s podcasts and thinks she might be an interesting subject for her series. She is, she tells Alix, on the cusp of great changes in her life.\n\nJosie’s life appears to be strange and complicated, and although Alix finds her unsettling, she can’t quite resist the temptation to keep making the podcast. Slowly she starts to realize that Josie has been hiding some very dark secrets, and before she knows it, Josie has inveigled her way into Alix’s life—and into her home.\n\nBut, as quickly as she arrived, Josie disappears. Only then does Alix discover that Josie has left a terrible and terrifying legacy in her wake, and that Alix has become the subject of her own true crime podcast, with her life and her family’s lives under mortal threat.\n\nWho is Josie Fair? And what has she done?\n\nSleater-Kinney’s co-leaders Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein dig into 25 years of shared history-making music and making noise. Listen to this bold duo speak openly about the places, people, and movements that have shaped their career as well as the evolution of their creative and personal relationship. The bandmates and friends trace how their ambitions and their relationship have continued to inform each other and how they’ve navigated through the ups and downs for the sake of the band and their art. They move seamlessly through the different chapters of the band, sharing peeks behind the curtain, like the story behind their beloved autobiographical song “One More Hour”, which they wrote about their own experience breaking up as a romantic couple and finding their way back to each other as friends and bandmates.\n\nThey dive into their ongoing journey from their beginnings out of the Riot Grrrl scene in Olympia, Washington, to Carrie’s triumph with the TV show Portlandia, and on to their continued efforts to challenge each other and meet the political moment. It’s a deeply personal and exciting exploration of themes that have followed them throughout their career, like anxiety, activism, feminism, LGBTQ identity, motherhood, friendship, creativity, and change - all illustrated by evocative new recordings that’ll make you turn up the volume.\n\nThis entry to the Words + Music series features eight exclusive new versions of songs spanning the band’s 10-album discography (so far), from “One More Hour” and “One Beat” to “Path of Wellness”, and “Worry With You” from their 2021 album Path of Wellness.\n\nA collection of warm, wise, and inspiring stories from the author of the best-selling One Native Life\n\nSince its publication in 2008, readers and reviewers have embraced Richard Wagamese's One Native Life. \"In quiet tones and luminous language,\" wrote the Winnipeg Free Press, \"Wagamese shares his hurts and joys, inviting readers to find the ways in which they are joined to him and to consider how they might be joined to others.\"\n\nIn this book, Richard Wagamese again invites listeners to accompany him on his travels. This time his focus is on stories: how they shape us, how they empower us, how they change our lives. Ancient and contemporary, cultural and spiritual, funny and sad, the tales are grouped according to the four essential principles Ojibway traditional teachers sought to impart: humility, trust, introspection, and wisdom.\n\nWhether the topic is learning from his fifth grade teacher about Martin Luther King Jr., gleaning understanding from a wolf track, lighting a fire for the first time without matches, or finding the universe in an eagle feather, these stories exhibit the warmth, wisdom, and generosity that made One Native Life so popular. As always, in this book, the land serves as Wagamese's guide. And as always, he finds that true home means not only community but conversation - good, straight-hearted talk about important things. We all need to tell our stories, he says. Every voice matters.\n\n#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A groundbreaking manifesto on living better and longer that challenges the conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary physician and leading longevity expert\n\n“One of the most important books you’ll ever read.”—Steven D. Levitt, New York Times bestselling author of Freakonomics\n\nWouldn’t you like to live longer? And better? In this operating manual for longevity, Dr. Peter Attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health.\n\nFor all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting.\n\nThis is not “biohacking,” it’s science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Dr. Attia’s aim is less to tell you what to do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. In Outlive, listeners will discover:\n\nWhy the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn’t tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack.\n\nThat you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging.\n\nWhy exercise is the most potent pro-longevity “drug”—and how to begin training for the “Centenarian Decathlon.”\n\nWhy you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern.\n\nWhy striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all.\n\nAging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. With the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.\n\nOn July 1, 2021, sports in America changed forever.\n\nAfter decades of protests, sanctions, and challenges, the NCAA fortress finally crumbled. The Supreme Court struck the decisive blow, ruling unanimously that restrictions on “education-related benefits” for college athletes violated antitrust law. At the same time, a host of new state laws took effect that - for the first time - gave college athletes the opportunity to earn money from sponsors.\n\nImmediately, college stars in football, basketball, soccer, volleyball, gymnastics, and many other sports began signing deals. The move minted instant millionaires, decriminalized a host of actions, and opened the floodgates for a whole new economy, creating ripple effects that will play out for decades while igniting long-smoldering controversies about equity, race, gender, and the values and power structure of “amateur” sports in America.\n\nIn this first season of Out of Bounds, we take a deep dive into the hot-button issue of money in college sports by telling the compelling inside stories of those who were impacted the most. We follow six diverse athletes - three from the past and three in the present–across a range of sports.\n\nWe look at all that was lost and risked in the era before the rules were changed - the sanctions and witch hunts, the vacated titles, reclaimed trophies, and the billions in income - while looking ahead to the enormous paydays and thorny questions this revolution entails. Along the way, we weave in the history of amateur sports in the US, the evolution and unchecked power of the NCAA monolith, and the long-brewing battle to provide fair pay to college athletes.\n\nIt all relates to one huge overarching question: Is this finally the end of amateur sports in America?\n\nAfter listening to Punk in Translation, you will never again think of punk as the exclusive territory of white men with mohawks. In eight immersive episodes, this Audible Original reveals the overlooked yet crucial role of Latin artists and Latin music in the origins and evolution of punk.\n\nMuch of the rule-breaking sound and style of punk’s music and political attitude was created and defined by Latin punk pioneers in the US and Latin America, starting with Question Mark and the Mysterians, the sons of Mexican migrant workers who formed the first band ever to be described as “punk rock” in a music magazine.\n\nThe stories of the artists in our series show how shifting notions of Latino identity in the US have played out through punk over the decades. We’ll reveal the Latin rock and roll roots of punk with artists like Ritchie Valens and Peru’s Los Saicos, and unearth the secret Latino history of New York’s CBGB’s. Punk in Translation profiles the Latino awakening in Hollywood’s early punk scene, and the Chicano punk revolution in East LA. And we’ll go to Tijuana, Mexico, the infamous sin city that became a gateway for American punk musicians to Latin America, and birthed Tijuana No!, the revolutionary band whose sound broke borders. We’ll even demonstrate the surprising roots of the punk anthem “Louie Louie” -- it comes from a Cuban cha cha chá. Punk in Translation dives in with these unsung Latin heroes to reveal the secret punk histories-and herstories- that not only reshaped music and the sound of social activism, but impacted the next 50 years of American culture.\n\nPunk in Translation is hosted in English and Spanish versions by Ceci Bastida, the Latin-Grammy nominated singer and songwriter who started her career with Tijuana No! when she was just a teenager.\n\nPunk in Translation features a cast of influential artists: Latin punk icon Alice Bag, Dead Kennedy’s Jello Biafra, Los Lobos’ Louie Perez, Victoria Ruiz of Downtown Boys, Blondie drummer Clem Burke, Willie Herron of seminal East LA punk band Los Illegals, Latin Alternative star Julieta Venegas, John Doe of famed Los Angeles band X, Bobby Balderrama of Question Mark and the Mysterians, Spitboy drummer Michelle Cruz Gonzales, Tony Abarca of South Central LA punk band Generación Suicida, Cuban pianist Chucho Valdés, former The Cramps and Nick Cave guitarist and queer Latin punk pioneer Kid Congo Powers, Los Saicos’ frontman Erwin Flores, Johnny Davila from Puerto Rican punk band Davila 666, drummer Rosie Rex, who played with The New York Dolls’ Sylvain Sylvain; and legendary rocker Joan Jett.\n\nThrough hard work and, well, tenacity, Jack Black and Kyle Gass catapulted themselves into rock superstardom. But before they were the only two members of the best rock band on earth, they were just Jack and Kyle, two theater students finding their footing in Los Angeles.\n\nThe D’s trajectory was a slow and steady rise from clubs to a guest spot on the hit show Mr. Show on HBO to albums to film to headlining festivals across the globe. But it wasn’t without its pains. This is their story.\n\nThese are their Words + Music.\n\nIn addition to seven newly recorded catalog songs exclusive to this volume, Tenacious D: The Road to Redunktion features 30 years of never-before-heard archival audio, bringing to life every anecdote with a docu-quality that places listeners right then and there. What’s unexpected is just how sweet it is to spend two hours with two true friends, both monstrously talented, delighting in their creativity and their unlikely journey from the living room to the stars.\n\n\"It's very important that you go to college in music, but it's probably more important that you drop out.\" (Rufus' mother, Kate McGarrigle)\n\nCelebrated singer, songwriter, and composer Rufus Wainwright knows exactly what to pack for his journey between St. Sauveur, Quebec, and New York City. He's intimately familiar with the route, from its topography to its emotional touchstones - each mile nearly etched into his psyche. The starting point, nestled in the Laurentian Mountains, is an hour northeast of Montreal and home to a large part of his fabled upbringing, with its rich maternal lineage and musical legacy. It's also loaded with some good ol' fashioned baggage. The end point, New York, like for so many before and after him, serves as a storied stomping ground for his rise as an artist and person, independent of his family. It's an ever-alluring but uneasy place, as it's dished out equal measures of validation and indifference throughout their testy relationship.\n\nIn Road Trip Elegies, Rufus sets out on the trek with his usual personal effects: a treasure trove of memories, a razor-sharp wit, and a big appetite for healthy self-reflection. But on this particular trip, he's packed two additional items to help navigate the experience: something to record himself with and someone to talk to. For the latter, Rufus has tapped his therapist. Yes, Mark the Analyst. (Hey, why not go for the best?) What ensues over the course of three one-hour episodes is a captivating, detailed, and candid coming of age story - an artist's awakening - shared by a man who uniquely understands from whence he came and how it's all played out ever since. As satisfying or soulful a premise that may be - Rufus is the consummate showman - Road Trip Elegies offers its listeners much, much more.\n\nIf Elegies is anchored in Rufus' driving excavation as an artist and son (his beloved mother, Canadian folk icon Kate McGarrigle, is an essential and enduring force in his life), the title is truly lifted and made whole by its spectacular musical counterpart. Generously woven throughout the duration of the drive, each live cut (more than 20 tracks in total) is plucked from an exquisite, recent set of performances some 3,000 miles west. Captured at McCabe's Guitar Store, a music venue in Los Angeles, the three-night run was designed specifically to accompany and punctuate moments and themes derived from his Road Trip. Backed by a tight-knit four-piece band, including his sister, Lucy Wainwright Roche (vocals), and Petra Haden (vocals/violin), and featuring top-notch stage banter throughout, Rufus seamlessly moves between a sweeping breadth of songs that span generation, genre, and timbre. Many tunes were penned by his own notable family members, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, or his distinguished folk-writing father, Loudon Wainwright III; others are gorgeously Rufus-ized versions of standards from the stage, the Great American Songbook, or more modern classics. Cue: Dylan's \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" and Barry Gibb's always welcome \"Islands in the Stream\". Enveloped in the warmth of devoted fans and a host of admiring special attendees (Burt Bacharach, Jessica Chastain, Mike Stoller, Shirley MacLaine, Chris Guest, Darren Criss, Anjelica Huston, Jackson Browne, and Van Dyke Parks to name-drop a few), the performance, throughout, conveys a fantastic sense of both intimacy and electricity.\n\nBy the time Rufus approaches the city, we've been richly serenaded with beautiful melodies courtesy of the West Coast and moving stories down the state thruway. Driving solo now (don't worry, his intrepid therapist was safely dropped off in Westchester), Rufus is admittedly fully loopy: emotionally drained but highly entertaining. The final leg has the remarkably palpable vibe of just Rufus and you, working in parallel, looking to land closure. Total catharsis is of course out of reach, but Rufus' Road Trip Elegies is a bold and beautiful testament to the power of not compartmentalizing our various parts or striving to disown our past, but rather, willfully embracing the full extent of us; seeking to grasp and contain even our most challenging of pieces to arrive, more completely, at peace of mind.\n\nIn this scripted Audible Original, wisecracking marine biologist and astronaut Bee Guerrero has signed up for the trip of a lifetime: a series of dives deep into the pitch-black waters of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus.\n\nSet in the near-future when global climate catastrophe has forced humans to search for solutions on new planets, The Sea in the Sky chronicles two astronauts’ journey, in what could be the final NASA-sponsored mission to space. In their search for life, Bee and Ty navigate uncharted waters, take on incredible risks and confront difficult truths about themselves. What will they find at the bottom of it all?\n\nAt times epic and intimate, laugh-out-loud funny and achingly soulful, The Sea in the Sky plumbs the depths of science and faith, triumph and failure. The Audible Original drama is told via daily \"dispatches\" sent from the space shuttle back to Earth, together with original music and sound design, a never-before-heard space rap, and a full cast of actors.\n\nDive into a world you need to hear to believe.\n\nContains sensitive content.\n\nThis original podcast is 12 episodes; please begin with the episode titled \"Prologue\".\n\nNote: this title contains fully immersive sound design and original composition. In order to enjoy the highest quality audio listening experience, please use headphones. If you choose to download this title, make sure it’s set to “High” in your settings.\n\n“My music has been a great resource and cathartic tool, but also something I’ve hid behind.”\n\nRevealing, intimate, and exhilaratingly raw, celebrated songwriter and acclaimed singer Sheryl Crow’s Words + Music provides the perfect canvas for the nine-time Grammy Award-winning artist to showcase her potent talent, articulate her complex inner workings, and breathe new life into a sizable stack of her most beloved tracks. Part of Audible’s rapidly expanding Words + Music series, blending storytelling, music, and performance to create exceptional listening experiences, Crow’s session is marked by gorgeously stripped-down versions of the songs that made her a household name (exclusively recorded for these sessions). The tunes punctuate rich storytelling, as she dives deep into the history of her career, reexamining the personal experiences and relationships that impacted her artistic journey.\n\n“My journey is my own”, Crow says. “I mean, it's definitely not without some detours and definitely not without some hard lessons”. True to form, Crow leads us through her winding road to success - maybe more accurately defined as a series of jolting roller-coaster rides, as she recounts all the fits and starts, the feverish highs and lows, that have come to define a career now in its fourth decade. Featuring stunningly crisp, yet lo-fi renditions of eight songs including, “If It Makes You Happy”, “All I Wanna Do”, “Leaving Las Vegas”, “Strong Enough”, “My Favorite Mistake”, and George Harrison’s soulful “Beware of Darkness”, Sheryl Crow lays herself bare. From her early days in small-town Missouri where she sought salvation from her melancholy by turning to mystical rockers (Stevie Nicks and Zeppelin, most notably); to pursuing her dreams, and in quick fashion landing the spectacular gig as one of Michael Jackson’s featured solo vocalists on tour. (A career catapult that quickly became a cautionary tale.)\n\nFrom the crushing weight of perfectionism and loneliness, to the joys of finally finding kindred musical spirits - only to have it all crumble, just as the music was skyrocketing, the toll of her volatile ascent to stardom comes into focus. In a particularly fascinating section, she revisits the total sense of peer disconnect during the height of her records’ success as her style was painfully incongruent with the greater musical landscape at the time. This, subsequently leading to an “adoption” of sorts by an older, more simpatico class of musicians - luckily for her, they doubled as her heroes: Nicks, Keith Richards, and Dylan among them. In another poignant moment, Sheryl lets listeners in on the dysfunction and emotional reckoning that came after her well-publicized romances with Eric Clapton and a few years later Lance Armstrong.\n\nIn just an hour and a half, Sheryl Crow manages to transform before our ears: from a well-known artist to human being we now know pretty damn well. That’s not easy to accomplish. And perhaps most extraordinarily, we are left with a lasting gift: beautiful songs we entered knowing become beautiful songs we now understand.\n\nPete Townshend is one of the great figures in rock ‘n’ roll history. For almost 60 years, The Who have balanced the physical and the spiritual with introspective lyrics and inspirational music. But there is a part of Townshend’s story—and The Who’s—that has not been examined.\n\nThese are his Words + Music.\n\nIn the Audible Original Pete Townshend: Somebody Saved Me, the songwriter takes us through the period between the 1978 death of Who drummer Keith Moon and the 2002 loss of bassist John Entwistle. During these 24 years, The Who enjoyed their greatest popularity—and broke up. But no matter how much he tried to deny it, The Who had a hold on Pete he could not ignore. Every time he thought he was out, rock ‘n’ roll pulled him back in.\n\nTownshend is honest about his victories and his failures in years spiked with conflict and resolution, the sacred and the profane, love and loss. Townshend punctuates his memories with the songs that came out of his life in that time—“Let My Love Open the Door”, “Slit Skirts”, “You Better You Bet\", “Eminence Front”, and more as you’ve never heard them before.\n\nIn Somebody Saved Me, Pete Townshend bares his soul, bares his teeth, and bares his heart.\n\nCover art photo © Pennie Smith\n\nHip-hop pioneer Chuck D, the legendary lyricist and cofounder of Public Enemy, takes listeners on an extraordinary journey through politically and socially conscious music. Part history lesson and part memoir, Songs That Shook the Planet spans genres and decades to call out the brave artists who continue to inspire necessary change in the world.\n\nYou’ll hear the stories behind legendary tracks as well as the songs themselves, performed by Billie Holiday, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Too Short, and more. Listening is both empowering and haunting; too often the artists paid a shocking price for their ability to articulate injustice so forcefully. Chuck D makes the experience even more revelatory by adding his own reminiscences about how the songs - many heard on the record player at home that his mother kept spinning with a stunning range of music - influenced his early life and his own career as an agent of change.\n\nSongs That Shook the Planet reintroduces listeners to indelible songs from artists who literally put their lives on the line to speak truth to power and provides a soundtrack of civil uprising that is perhaps even more powerful and relevant today.\n\nSongs That Shook the Planet was conceived, written, and produced, by Chuck D & Lorrie Boula as the latest installment of Audible’s Words + Music franchise, with additional writing by Arthur Turnbull and Gia'na M.Garel.\n\n\"Can music change the world? Of course it can, it does every day. Music sure as hell changed me.\" (Tom Morello)\n\nRock god. Justice fighter. Rabble-rouser. Ivy Leaguer. An American renegade and fearless truth teller. Rage Against the Machine’s guitar virtuoso, Tom Morello, is many things; but perhaps, he himself, sums it up best: a one-man revolution. For the first time ever, hear Morello fuse the deeply personal with the political in a rapturous, badass, one-man show that skillfully balances soul-bearing stories with spellbinding guitar fury: Speaking Truth to Power Through Stories and Song by Tom Morello.\n\nExecutive produced by the legendary, multi-Grammy winning producer and composer T Bone Burnett, Morello’s performance adds to a growing list of iconic talent (Patti Smith, James Taylor, Common) who give voice to Audible’s Words and Music series: a new type of audio-only memoir that blends storytelling, music, and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience.\n\nMorello begins at the beginning, opening up about his tumultuous childhood in small-town Illinois, his grappling with sense of identity and ultimate artistic purpose. \"I was the only black kid in an all-white town, the only anarchist at a conservative high school, the only heavy metal shredding guitar player at Harvard University, and the only Ivy League Star Trek loving nerd in the world’s biggest political rock rap band.” As Morello takes us thru poignant moments of an astounding and meaningful career (Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, the Nightwatchman, Springsteen and the E-Street Band, Prophets of Rage, The Atlas Underground) we hear firsthand of the triumphs and tragedies, riffs and rebellions that mark a life in shattering artistic bounds, confronting the establishment, and creating/collaborating on music that matters.\n\nBy the time Tom closes out the show by leading a palpably super-charged audience through a banging version of “Killing in the Name Of”, Lennon’s working-class anthem “Power to the People”, and, finally, a spirited and wholly sincere “This Land Is Your Land”, a piercing truth resounds: Tom Morello is a singular force and a most essential type of artist: the kind who not only inspires but empowers. In the words of T Bone Burnett, who provides a tender lead-in to the rare performance, “There is no more articulate or intelligent musician today than Tom Morello. He is a magical guitarist and a deep storyteller whose life and artistry reflect and challenge the time we live in.”\n\nNATIONAL BESTSELLER • An audacious, darkly glittering novel set in the eerie days of civilization’s collapse—the spellbinding story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity. Now an original series on HBO Max. Over one million copies sold!\n\nKirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous Hollywood actor, had a heart attack on stage during a production of King Lear. That was the night when a devastating flu pandemic arrived in the city, and within weeks, civilization as we know it came to an end.\n\nTwenty years later, Kirsten moves between the settlements of the altered world with a small troupe of actors and musicians. They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten the tiny band’s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.\n\nIndie-rock icon Aimee Mann is well acquainted with trauma and the transformative act of using it as a basis for artistic expression, but that doesn’t mean that she knows how or why it works. Mann goes on a journey of discovery to better understand the link between damage and why what we do with it matters.\n\nThese are her Words + Music.\n\nIn Straw into Gold, Mann partners with actor, comedian, and creator of the popular podcast Dead Eyes, Connor Ratliff, to lead a small group of artists through a series of intimate, often funny, and always enlightening conversations about the relationship between the bad things that happen to us and the art that can result from them.\n\nListeners of Straw into Gold will delight in new renditions of songs from beloved albums including Whatever and Charmer, as well as many newer songs from Mann’s 2021 studio album Queens of the Summer Hotel, soon to appear in Mann’s upcoming Broadway musical adaptation of Susanna Kaysen’s seminal novel Girl, Interrupted–which served as a primary inspiration behind the explorations in Straw into Gold.\n\n\"A great song is a magic trick, it’s a slight of hand, it’s supposed to look effortless.\"\n\nOn rare occasion, a fascinating artist will endeavor to peel back the curtain and truly reveal themselves: Their craft, their thoughts, their pain, their humanity. But it is even more rare that the artist actually possesses the range of gifts to pull it off. St. Vincent is such an artist. And St. Vincent: Words plus Music is such an experience. Armed to the teeth with words, wisdom, grit, and wit to spare, St. Vincent’s new addition to Audible’s Words plus Music is a deeply personal meditation on an artist’s discovery of their authentic self-tracked through the lyrics and influences of her Grammy-winning catalog of music.\n\nHeralding the first in a series of upcoming collaborations between Audible and entertainment company Gunpowder and Sky, St. Vincent: Words plus Music continues to raise the bar on its existing blueprint - blending storytelling, music, and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience.\n\nIn a relatively short span of time, Annie Clark, the sublime singer, songwriter, guitarist, and performer known professionally as St. Vincent, has established herself as a uniquely profound talent, an iconic new voice in today’s music landscape. And after just 90 minutes in total running time, listeners can arrive at only one of two inevitable positions: Either confirm what they already knew - St. Vincent is an exquisite artist and storyteller - or marvel, with some embarrassment, at how they’ve inadvertently managed to miss out on this sensational artist since at least 2007.\n\nFeaturing nine newly-recorded versions of catalog hits curated from among her five albums including stunning versions of \"New York\", \"Marry Me\", \"Strange Mercy\", \"Digital Witness\", and \"Mass Seduction\", St. Vincent effectively creates a series of gorgeous musical \"trail markers\" through which she and listeners can understand (spiritually and otherwise) the course of her journey - as a woman and artist. In between these songs, in vivid detail, St. Vincent fills in the rest - offering unflinching honesty, delightfully dark humor, and more subtle Catholic imagery and metaphor than she knows what to do with.\n\nWhether she’s deconstructing the juxtaposing \"grandeur and squalor\" of being a working artist, singing about the manic seduction of today’s endless stimulation (\"I can't turn off what turns me on\"), or explaining the visceral jolt of no longer being on the road in one fell swoop (\"Come down from tour is like a werewolf receding\"), there are few artists today - young or old - with St. Vincent’s searing command of self and unique power to express it.\n\nTalent like this must be heard.\n\nTHE INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER!\n\nA glorious and tantalizing new escape from #1 New York Times bestselling author Carley Fortune.\n\nThis summer they’ll keep their promise.
