        "text": "Garbers big day leads Cal past Illinois in Redbox Bowl\n\nChase Garbers threw four touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading California to a 35-20 win over Illinois on Monday in the Redbox Bowl.\n\nGarbers, who had been in and out of the lineup all season because of a shoulder injury, got going after being sacked on the first play from scrimmage and throwing an incomplete pass on the second. The offensive MVP of the game, Garbers completed 22 of 31 passes for 272 yards with TD passes of 4, 3, 2 and 6 yards. He also scored on a quarterback sneak from the 1 early in the second quarter while helping the Bears set a season-high for scoring.\n\nThe Bears won all seven games this season when the oft-injured Garbers played more than one half.\n\nChristopher Brown Jr. ran for 120 yards on 20 carries, and Makai Polk caught five passes for a season-high 105 yards as Cal (8-5) won its first bowl game since 2015.\n\nBrandon Peters passed for 273 yards and one touchdown for Illinois (6-7) in his return after sitting out the regular-season finale with a concussion. Peters, who has shaken up again after diving out of bounds following a scramble late in the fourth quarter, completed 22 of 37 passes and added a team-high 68 rushing yards.\n\nThe Illini lost despite outgaining the Bears in total yards 450-395.\n\nThe strong showing by Garbers offset an uneven day by California's defense.\n\nThe Bears allowed a field goal and touchdown on the Fighting Illini's first two drives, then surrendered a late field goal before halftime.\n\nIllinois' offense was mostly stagnant after that, while California pulled away.\n\nThe Bears had lost three of their previous four bowl games.\n\nCalifornia led 14-10 late in the second quarter before the teams combined for 10 points in the final 25 seconds.\n\nAfter Wilcox made the decision to go for it on a 4th-and-goal, Garbers threw a short swing pass to Brown, who stiff-armed Illinois linebacker Tolson Khalan before reaching the end zone.\n\nPeters helped the Illini answer quickly. He completed three consecutive passes for 58 yards, setting up a 30-yard field goal by James McCourt.\n\nAntetokounmpo scores 23 in return, Bucks beat Bulls 123-102\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo had 23 points and 10 rebounds after missing two games with a sore back, and Milwaukee pulled away in the second half for a 123-102 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday night.\n\nAntetokounmpo, the league's second-leading scorer with an average of 30.5 points per game entering this one, played only 27 minutes and sat out the final 5 1/2 because of the lopsided score. He was 8 for 14 from the field with six assists.\n\nKhris Middleton scored 25 points for the Bucks, and Eric Bledsoe had 15 points in 16 minutes after missing the previous eight games with a fractured right leg.\n\nZach LaVine scored 19 points for Chicago but shot just 7 for 23 from the field. Lauri Markkanen and Coby White had 18 points apiece and Wendell Carter Jr. added 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulls.\n\nMilwaukee jumped out to an 8-0 lead as Chicago missed its first six shots. The Bucks led 31-20 at the end of the first quarter and stretched it to 33-20 early in the second on a basket by Robin Lopez.\n\nBut the Bulls - after shooting 9 of 29 in the first - suddenly got hot from behind the 3-point arc. White and Markkanen each had three 3-pointers in the second to trim the Milwaukee advantage. Chicago was 8 for 14 on 3s in the quarter.\n\nWith just under two minutes left in the first half, White hit a driving scoop off the glass to give the Bulls a 52-51 lead, their first of the game.\n\nAntetokounmpo quickly answered with a putback on the other end to put the Bucks back on top. Milwaukee led 55-52 at halftime thanks in part to a 15-0 advantage in free throw attempts (making 12).\n\nAny chance of a Chicago upset was quickly dashed in the third. The Bucks opened with a 17-4 run for a 72-56 lead - with Antetokounmpo capping the spurt with a thunderous dunk that drew a loud roar from the United Center crowd.\n\nMilwaukee led 95-77 after three quarters. Kyle Korver hit a 3-pointer 2 1/2 minutes into the fourth for a 105-81 advantage, the Bucks' biggest of the game.\n\nPackers Secure First Round Bye\n\nAaron Rodgers threw a short and accurate pass to Aaron Jones, whose 31-yard reception set up Mason Crosby's 33-yard field goal as time expired to lift the Packers to a 23-20 win over the Detroit Lions that earned them a No. 2 seed and a first-round bye.\n\nThe Packers (13-3) fell behind the last-place Lions by two touchdowns in the second quarter and didn't lead until Crosby made his second game-winning kick against Detroit this season.\n\nGreen Bay won a fifth straight game despite Rodgers struggling for much of the afternoon. Rodgers was 27 of 55 for 323 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. He connected on less than half of his attempts for the second time this season and finished with his second-lowest rating of the year.\n\nThe Lions (3-12-1) closed with nine straight losses for their longest losing streak in a season since going 0-16 in 2008.\n\nDavid Blough was 12 of 29 for 122 yards with an interception - and a 19-yard touchdown reception - filling in for Matthew Stafford, who had a season-ending back injury.\n\nPlaying in the postseason for the first time since 2016, Green Bay will be the No 2 NFC seed and have a bye before hosting a game.\n\nIllinois Blows By North Carolina A&T\n\nKofi Cockburn scored a career-high 26 points and Illinois beat North Carolina A&T 95-64 on Sunday.\n\nThe 7-foot freshman also grabbed nine rebounds, narrowly missing his seventh double-double in 13 games. Cockburn has more double-doubles this season than any other freshman in the country. He scored 23 points on two occasions earlier this season against Grand Canyon and Miami.\n\nAyo Dosunmu had 19 points and Alan Griffin added 18 for Illinois (9-4).\n\nTyler Maye and Devin Haygood scored 12 points each for North Carolina A&T (3-11). Ronald Jackson added 10 points for the Aggies.\n\nIllinois has had issues this year with slow starts but led 50-34 at the half. The Illini put together a 6-0 run early in the game and a 14-2 run fueled by back-to-back 3-pointers from Trent Frazier in the closing minutes of the half.\n\nIllinois shot 53% (36 of 68) from the field.\n\nNorth Carolina A&T turned the ball over 18 times, leading to 28 Illinois points. The Illini turned the ball over only nine times.\n\nIllinois kicks off its Big Ten schedule on Thursday at No. 14 Michigan State.\n\nBears End Disappointing Campaign With Win\n\nEddy Pineiro's fourth field goal of the game came from 22 yards with 10 seconds left, giving the Bears a 21-19 victory on Sunday with the Vikings resting their regulars for the playoffs.\n\nPineiro, the latest attempt by the Bears (8-8) to solve their persistent kicking trouble, finished the season with 11 straight made field goals. Mitch Trubisky highlighted another unremarkable, conservative performance by hitting Riley Ridley for 34 yards on fourth-and-9 with 2:36 left from midfield to set up the winning kick.\n\nTrubisky went 26 for 37 for 207 yards.\n\nDavid Montgomery had 23 carries for 113 yards and a touchdown to cap a strong rookie season and help the Bears beat the Vikings (10-6) for the fourth consecutive time. Chicago dodged what would have been a fifth losing record in six years, after winning the NFC North in 2018 in Nagy's debut.\n\nMinnesota missed a third 11-win season in six years under coach Mike Zimmer, but he was far more concerned about taking a healthy team to the playoffs.\n\nMike Boone rushed 17 times for 148 yards and a touchdown for the Vikings, atoning for three costly miscues in the first half.\n\nThe Bears will regroup for 2020, with the offense the top priority for upgrades. They don't have a first-round draft pick, sent previously to the Raiders for OLB Khalil Mack, but they have an extra second-rounder that came in that trade last year.\n\nBlackhawks Outlast Blue Jackets in Shootout\n\nJoonas Korpisalo had to leave the game with an injury after unsuccessfully trying to stop the first-round overtime shot from Jonathan Toews. Columbus backup Elvis Merzlikins entered the game cold and allowed the third-round shooter, Patrick Kane, to juke him and get one in on the net.\n\nChicago goalie Robin Lehner then shut down Nathan Gerbe in the third round of the tie-breaker to preserve the Blackhawks' 3-2 win.\n\nThe Blackhawks, who have won four of the last five, got third-period goals from Dylan Strome and Erik Gustafsson to send the game into the extra period.\n\nAn apparent goal from Zach Werenski just before the buzzer in the 5-minute overtime period was waved off because a replay showed the puck crossed the goal line after time expired. That set up the shootout.\n\nThe Blue Jackets got regulation goals from Pierre-Luc Dubois and Riley Nash, and Korpisalo had 28 saves. Gustav Nyquist scored in the shootout. Columbus lost its second straight game beyond regulation but extended a points streak to 10 games (6-0-4).\n\nThe Blackhawks are at Calgary on Tuesday night.\n\nBlues Blast Jets\n\nJaden Schwartz scored twice and Jordan Binnington made 25 saves to help St. Louis beat the Winnipeg Jets 4-1 on Sunday for its season-best eighth straight victory.\n\nRyan O'Reilly and Robert Thomas also scored for St. Louis.

They had a seven-game streak Oct. 27-Nov. 9.\n\nNicholas Shore scored and Connor Hellebuyck made 24 saves for Winnipeg. The Jets have lost six of eight to fall to 21-15-3.\n\nSchwartz gave the Blues a 2-1 lead with 4:51 left in the second period, taking a feed from Jordan Kyrou on a two-on-one break and beating Hellebuyck through the legs. Schwartz added an empty-netter with 30 seconds remaining. He has 13 goals, two more than all of last season. In a six-game points streak, he has four goals and eight assists.\n\nO'Reilly scored his first home goal of the season, pushing Alex Pietrangelo's rebound stick-side past Hellebuyck with 5:42 left in the first. The assist was the 326th of Pietrangelo's career, moving him past Al MacInnis atop the franchise leaderboard for defensemen.\n\nThomas made it 3-1 when he roofed a shot past Hellebuyck on a power play at 7:06 of the third.\n\nThe Blues are at Arizona on Tuesday night.\n\nMonticello Blows By Ridgeview for Third Place at Holiday Hoopla\n\nRyan Reeder scored 17 of his 20 points in the first half, Garrett Kepley scored all 10 of his points in the second half and Monticello boat raced Ridgeview 54-32 for third place from the Monticello Holiday Hoopla.\n\nThe Sages led 20-10 after the first quarter and opened up a 36-16 lead at the break. The Mustangs would get no closer than 15 in the second half as Monticello rebounded from a disappointing effort against Tuscola the day before that snapped a six-game win streak.\n\nThe Sages shot 55-percent from the floor and went 5-for-8 from distance and scored 14 points off 10 Mustangs turnovers.\n\nLevi Zimmerman was neutralized for 10 points.\n\nThe Sages improve to 7-4 overall while Ridgeview drops to 10-3.\n\nMonticello returns to action next Saturday afternoon against Marshall at home.

The three-time All-Star led the American League with 21 homers when the Mariners dealt him to New York in June. But the Yankees declined an option for next season after he was limited by oblique problems down the stretch.\n\nEncarnación batted .249 with 13 homers and 37 RBIs in 44 regular-season games with the Yankees. He hit .308 while New York pounded Minnesota in the AL Division Series, but slumped badly in the AL Championship Series against Houston.\n\nEncarnación, turns 37 on Jan. 7, has eight straight seasons with more than 30 homers. He has 414 homers in 15 years with Cincinnati, Toronto, Cleveland, Seattle and New York.\n\nHe figures to serve as the designated hitter and play first base along with slugger Jose Abreu.\n\nThe White Sox have been loading up around a promising young core, hoping to challenge in the AL Central after seven straight losing seasons. Encarnación joins former AL Cy Young Award winner Dallas Keuchel and catcher Yasmani Grandal as big-money additions this offseason.\n\nThe White Sox agreed Saturday to a $55.5 million, three-year deal with Keuchel, a day after finalizing a one-year contract with two-time All-Star pitcher Gio González. They also brought back Abreu on a $50 million, three-year deal and acquired outfielder Nomar Mazara from the Texas Rangers.\n\nThe White Sox were 72-89 last season, well behind the 101-win Minnesota Twins and 93-win Cleveland Indians. But they believe they are in position to make a big jump after missing the playoffs for the 13th time in 14 years since their 2005 World Series championship. That’s because young players established themselves in the majors and promising prospects remain in the pipeline.\n\nTim Anderson led the majors with a .335 average last year. Yoán Moncada had a breakthrough season, hitting .315 with 25 homers and 79 RBIs. Eloy Jiménez showed pop as a rookie, with a .267 average, 31 homers and 79 RBIs. Prized outfielder Luis Robert figures to debut next spring, and top prospect Nick Madrigal might also be ready to get significant time at second base.\n\nKeuchel and Gonzalez will join a rotation led by All-Star Lucas Giolito that also includes Reynaldo Lopez and Dylan Cease. Promising young right-hander Michael Kopech is also expected to return following Tommy John surgery.\n\nSchenn, Blues cruise into Christmas break by thumping Kings\n\nBrayden Schenn scored twice in St. Louis' four-goal first period and the Blues won their sixth straight game, 4-1 over the Los Angeles Kings on Monday night.\n\nVince Dunn had a goal and an assist, and Jaden Schwartz scored on the power play for the Blues.\n\nJordan Binnington made 29 saves in his first start since Dec. 16 against Colorado. Alex Pietrangelo and David Perron each had two assists.\n\nAlex Iafallo had a power-play goal and Jonathan Quick made 24 saves, but the Kings lost their third in a row.\n\nSchenn opened the scoring at 4:51 and wrapped the flurry by getting a power-play goal that gave St. Louis a 4-0 lead with his 17th of the season.\n\nSchwartz tipped in Pietrangelo's shot on the power play for a 2-0 lead at 5:43, and Dunn made it 3-0 at 11:22.\n\nIafallo got the Kings on the board when he redirected Drew Doughty's shot from the blue line with 1:07 left in the opening period.\n\nZajac helps New Jersey Devils pound Chicago Blackhawks 7-1\n\nTravis Zajac capped New Jersey's dominant second period with a short-handed goal, and the Devils headed into their holiday break with a 7-1 victory over the Blackhawks.\n\nSubban, Damon Severson, and John Hayden also scored in the second as New Jersey won for just the third time in 12 games. Jack Hughes picked up his fifth goal in the first, and Blake Coleman and Pavel Zacha scored in the third in this matchup of last-place teams.\n\nNikita Gusev had three assists and Mackenzie Blackwood made 32 saves, helping New Jersey bounce back from consecutive losses to Washington and Columbus by a combined score of 11-4.\n\nIt was the highest-scoring game of the season for the Devils and the worst loss of the year for the Blackhawks.\n\nChicago had won three of four, including consecutive victories at Winnipeg and Colorado. Zack Smith scored in the first period and Corey Crawford made 16 saves on 20 shots before he was pulled in the second.\n\nSubban put New Jersey ahead to stay when he drove a slap shot from the top of the slot past a screened Crawford 51 seconds into the second.\n\nThe Devils were just getting started.\n\nSeverson drove to the net and stuffed the puck between Crawford's legs at 7:22. Hayden chased Crawford at 10:40, and Zajac made it 5-1 when he flipped a rebound past Robin Lehner with 2:38 left in the period.\n\nPackers clinch NFC North with 23-10 win over Vikings\n\nAaron Jones rushed for 154 yards and two second-half touchdowns, Za'Darius Smith had five tackles for loss to lead a stifling performance by the defense, and the Packers beat the Vikings 23-10 on Monday night.\n\nKirk Cousins was sacked five times, with a whopping 3 1/2 by Smith, and he threw an interception in the third quarter that set up the first score by Jones, who leads the league with 16 rushing touchdowns.\n\nThe Vikings had 132 total yards, as Cousins fell to 0-9 in his career in Monday night games.\n\nThe Vikings had only seven first downs and never netted a drive longer than 31 yards in this concerning regression. They wasted a fine performance by their defense, which has produced 10 turnovers in the last two games.\n\nMinnesota's frustration over a stalled offense that averaged nearly 30 points over the previous 10 games only increased in the second half. Stefon Diggs caught a 28-yard pass on third-and-18 in the third quarter, but Cousins was intercepted later on the drive when Diggs was tangled up with Jaire Alexander and Kevin King made a leaping grab before a 39-yard return.\n\nThe Vikings punted on fourth-and-1 from their 45 to white-flag their ensuing possession.\n\nHoliday hits key shots in Pacers' OT home win over Raptors\n\nThe Pacers snapped the Raptors' five-game win streak with a 120-115 overtime triumph on Monday.\n\nAaron Holiday's fourth 3-pointer of the game gave the Pacers a 116-113 lead with 2:05 remaining in overtime. His fifth and final 3-pointer provided a 119-115 advantage with 54 seconds remaining.\n\nLowry managed just two points in overtime when the Pacers outscored the Raptors 13-8.\n\nSerge Ibaka added 23 and Fred VanVleet 21 for the Raptors\n\nThe Pacers' Myles Turner sank 5 of 6 3-pointers in finishing 9 of 12 from the floor.\n\nRoss scores 26, leads Magic to 103-95 victory over Bulls\n\nTerrence Ross scored a season-high 26 points Monday night to help the Orlando Magic break a three-game losing streak with a 103-95 victory over the Chicago Bulls.\n\nZach LaVine led Chicago with 26 points on 8-of-26 shooting, but the Bulls managed only 14 points in the fourth quarter. Tomas Satoransky added 20 points and was 4 of 5 on 3-point shots.\n\nNikola Vucevic had 21 points and seven rebounds for Orlando, which blocked 13 shots and held the Bulls to 31 percent shooting in the second half. Jonathan Isaac finished with 13 points, nine rebounds, five assists, four steals and three blocks.\n\nRoss, who made six 3-pointers, hit a short jumper and a 3-pointer on a 7-0 Magic run early in the fourth quarter to put Orlando ahead to stay.\n\nWith LaVine hitting two free throws and a 3-pointer, the Bulls scored the first nine points of the game.\n\nLauri Markkanen and LaVine made two 3-pointers apiece in the last 4:15 of the first half to leave Chicago with a 54-51 lead at the break.\n\nChiefs Blow By Bears\n\nMahomes outplayed Mitchell Trubisky, throwing for two touchdowns and running for another score, and the Chiefs beat the Chicago Bears 26-3 Sunday night for their fifth straight win.\n\nKansas City (11-4) remained a game behind New England for the AFC's second seed. The Patriots clinched their 11th consecutive AFC East championship by beating Buffalo on Saturday. The Chiefs hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over New England thanks to a victory two weeks ago that helped secure their fourth AFC West title in a row.\n\nMahomes' big game in his first appearance at Soldier Field is just another blow for Chicago in a rough season that began with Super Bowl hopes. The Bears passed on Mahomes when they traded up a spot to grab Trubisky with the No. 2 overall pick in 2017. Mahomes went to Kansas City at No. 10 and won the MVP award last season.\n\nTrubisky has not performed the way the Bears envisioned. And with their playoff hopes already dashed coming off an NFC North championship, they got outclassed by Kansas City.\n\nMahomes, playing his 30th game, became the fastest player to reach the 9,000-yard passing mark. He was 23 of 33 for 251 yards, giving him 9,238 in three seasons. Hall of Famer Kurt Warner did it in 32 games.\n\nMahomes also has 75 touchdown passes, making him the fastest player to hit that mark.\n\nTravis Kelce, already the first tight end with four straight 1,000-yard seasons, became the first to reach 1,200 yards in back-to-back years. He caught eight passes for 74 yards, giving him 1,205 this year. That included a 6-yard touchdown near the end of the first half.\n\nHarrison Butker kicked a career-best 56-yard field goal that was the fourth-longest in franchise history. He also hit both the left and right uprights on a missed extra point.\n\nThe Bears (7-8) dropped their second straight after winning four of five.\n\nTrubisky completed 18 of 34 passes for 157 yards. Kahlil Mack had a sack, and fans let the Bears have it before heading toward the exits in the closing minutes.\n\nThe Bears visit Minnesota on Dec. 29.\n\nPackers Visit Vikings for Crucial NFC North Tilt on Monday Night Football\n\nThe Green Bay Packers been outscored in the second and fourth quarters. Only four of their 11 wins have come by more than one score. Their team rankings in rushing and passing yardage on both offense and defense are all in the bottom half of the league.\n\nThe Packers need only one victory over their final two games to take the division title and a first-round bye for the playoffs remains well within reach as they visit Minnesota on Monday night football.\n\nGreen Bay has the second-fewest turnovers in the NFL with nine, and their rushing attack spearheaded by Aaron Jones has ably complemented Rodgers in his up-and-down attempt to help his young wide receivers hit their stride. The defense has the third-best interception percentage in the league and the fifth-best red zone rate, allowing fewer than half of opponent possessions inside the 20 to cross the goal line.\n\nThe Packers have joined the Bills and the 49ers as teams already in the playoff field that missed the cut last season.\n\nGiannis Leads Bucks Past Pacers\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo had 18 points, 19 rebounds and nine assists, and the Bucks spoiled Malcolm Brogdon's return to Milwaukee with a 117-89 win over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night.\n\nWesley Matthews scored 19 points for NBA-leading Milwaukee, which has won three in a row since a 120-116 loss to Dallas stopped an 18-game win streak.\n\nBrogdon scored his first points on a layup with 10:28 to play in the second quarter, giving the Pacers a 26-24 lead. Donte DiVincenzo made a layup to give Milwaukee a 56-55 advantage with 53 seconds left in the first half, and the Bucks never trailed again.\n\nMilwaukee outscored Indiana 58-34 in the second half and had a 48-34 advantage in points in the paint.\n\nDomantas Sabonis had 19 points and 18 rebounds for Indiana and McDermott finished with 15 points.\n\nThe Pacers shot 12 for 40 from 3-point range. The Bucks made 15 3-pointers, including five straight in the fourth.\n\nBrook Lopez and George Hill each had 17 points for the Bucks. Hill is averaging 16 points off the bench over the last three games.\n\nThe Pacers host the Raptors on Monday.\n\nWhite Sox A gree To Terms With LHPs Keuchel, Gonzalez\n\nThe Chicago White Sox and left-hander Dallas Keuchel have agreed to a $55 million, three-year deal, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.\n\nKeuchel’s deal includes a vesting option for 2023 that would bring the total value to $74 million.\n\nThe 31-year-old Keuchel won the AL Cy Young Award with the Houston Astros in 2015 but struggled to find work last offseason as a free agent. He signed a roughly $13 million, one-year deal with the Atlanta Braves in June and went 8-8 with a 3.75 ERA for the NL East champions.\n\nThe long-bearded veteran joins catcher Yasmani Grandal as a big-money addition to the White Sox this offseason. Grandal signed a $73 million, four-year contract with Chicago last month.\n\nThe White Sox also brought back slugger Jose Abreu on a $50 million, three-year deal, acquired outfielder Nomar Mazara from the Texas Rangers and added lefty starter Gio Gonzalez on a $5 million, one-year contract that includes a 2021 option.\n\nKeuchel and Gonzalez will join a rotation led by All-Star Lucas Giolito that also includes Reynaldo Lopez and Dylan Cease. Promising young right-hander Michael Kopech is also expected to return following Tommy John surgery.\n\nChicago is hoping to challenge in the AL Central behind a young core of hitters, including Yoan Moncada, Tim Anderson and Eloy Jimenez. Top prospect Nick Madrigal might also be ready to get significant time at second base. The White Sox were 72-89 last season, well behind the 101-win Minnesota Twins and 93-win Cleveland Indians.\n\nAgent Scott Boras negotiated the deal for Keuchel and has earned his players $936 million in contracts this offseason, including a $324 million, nine-year deal between Gerrit Cole and the New York Yankees and $245 million, seven-year deals for Stephen Strasburg with the Washington Nationals and Anthony Rendon with the Los Angeles Angels. Boras is expected to clear the $1 billion mark this winter.\n\nThe White Sox also boosted their starting rotation, finalizing a $5 million, one-year contract with two-time All-Star Gio González that includes a 2021 club option.\n\nThe deal announced Friday calls for a $4.5 million salary in 2020 and gives the White Sox a $7 million option for 2021 with a $500,000 buyout. He can earn an additional $1 million in performance bonuses in 2020 based on starts: $250,000 each for 15, 20, 25 and 30.\n\nThe 34-year-old left-hander finally will get a chance to pitch for the team that took him with the No. 38 overall pick in the 2004 amateur draft. Chicago dealt González to Philadelphia following the 2005 season as part of the trade that sent Aaron Rowand to the Phillies for Jim Thome, then reacquired González a year later along with Gavin Floyd for Freddy García. The White Sox traded González to Oakland for Nick Swisher in January 2008.\n\nGonzález was 3-2 with a 3.50 ERA in 17 starts and 19 appearances last season.\n\nChicago went 72-89 in its seventh straight losing season and missed the playoffs for the 13th time in 14 years since its 2005 World Series title. But with young players establishing themselves in the majors and promising prospects in the minors, the White Sox expect to contend for a postseason spot.\n\nRight-hander Lucas Giolito went from the highest ERA among qualifiers in 2018 to his first All-Star season, going 14-9 with a 3.41 ERA in 29 starts.\n\nThe White Sox could have a solid rotation if Michael Kopech bounces back from Tommy John surgery and Dylan Cease progresses. Both are 23.\n\nMonticello Cruises to Win Over Greenville\n\nBrigg Fultz first career double-double helped Monticello to their second double-digit victory, a 56-35 win over Greenville at the Comets Quad Saturday night in non-conference high school boys basketball action.\n\nThe Sages beat Staunton earlier in the day 44-26 and moved a game over-500 heading into Holiday Hoopla action next week.\n\nFultz scored 14 points and grabbed 13 rebounds.

They have won seven of the last eight FCS championships including the last two.\n\nThe Bison held the unseeded Redbirds (10-5) to three points for the second time this season, having beaten Illinois State 37-3 in a Missouri Valley Football Conference game in Fargo on Oct. 5.\n\nThis time the Redbirds defense kept the game close, allowing only Crosa’s field goals of 38, 33 and 22 yards on consecutive possessions for a 9-0 halftime lead.\n\nIllinois State’s only points came from Sam Fenlason’s 27-yard field goal after a 70-yard drive. The Redbirds reached Bison territory only one other time.\n\nTrey Lance was 10-of-21 passing for 135 yards and rushed for 41 yards on 11 carries for North Dakota State.

A few hours later, the Packers were playoff bound, when the Dallas Cowboys beat the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nWith the win, Green Bay (11-3) swept the Bears for the 15th time in the last 26 seasons and the seventh time in 11 seasons. The Packers defeated Chicago 10-3 in the season opener. Green Bay now leads the series 99-95-6.\n\nAaron Rodgers completed just 16 of 33 passes for a pedestrian 203 yards. The two-time MVP entered the day with a 103.2 career passer rating against the Bears, the highest in league history of quarterbacks with at least 250 passes against Chicago. He had a 78.2 rating on Sunday.\n\nMitchell Trubisky completed his first five pass attempts for the Bears (7-7) but for only 18 yards. Chicago's offense opened the game with three straight punts and a turnover on downs. Trubisky finished 28 of 53 for 321 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions, and the Bears had their three-game win streak end.\n\nThe Packers got on the board first on a 29-yard strike from Rodgers to Davante Adams in the first quarter. Adams beat Buster Skrine off the line for his fourth touchdown in the last four weeks. Adams finished with 103 yards on seven catches.\n\nEddy Pineiro knocked in a 30-yard field goal late in the first half for the Bears.\n\nThe Packers opened the second half with an impressive five-play, 73-yard drive that featured a 34-yard reception to Adams, a season-long 17-yard scamper by Rodgers, and a 21-yard touchdown run by Aaron Jones, his 13th rushing TD of the season.\n\nAfter another stalled possession by Chicago, Rodgers and Jake Kumerow linked up for a 49-yard gain, Kumerow's longest reception of the season. The play helped set up another score for Jones from 2 yards and the Packers took a commanding 21-3 lead in the third quarter.\n\nPineiro added a 27-yard field goal at the start of the fourth and Trubisky found Anthony Miller for a 2-yard score to cut it to 21-13 with 8:09 to go. Miller had nine catches for 118 yards and the score.\n\nDefensive lineman Dean Lowry picked off Trubisky with 6:33 left, Lowry's first career interception.\n\nKenny Clark had two sacks and Rashan Gary had another for the Packers. Nick Kwiatkoski had the lone sack for Chicago.\n\nAllen Robinson had seven catches for 125 yards for the Bears, who saw their three-game winning streak end.\n\nThe Bears host the Chiefs next Sunday night.\n\nThe Packers play at the Vikings next Monday night.\n\nBlackhawks Blast Wild\n\nPatrick Kane scored three goals for his first hat trick of the season, and the Blackhawks stopped a four-game slide by topping the Minnesota Wild 5-3 on Sunday night.\n\nBrandon Saad and David Kampf also scored for Chicago, which had dropped seven of nine overall. Jonathan Toews had three assists, and Robin Lehner made 23 stops.\n\nKevin Fiala scored twice for Minnesota in the opener of a three-game trip. Eric Staal also scored for his 1,000th career point, and Ryan Suter had three assists.\n\nThe game was tied at 3 in the third period when Saad muscled his way to his 11th goal of the season.\n\nThe rugged forward was grappling with Minnesota defenseman Matt Dumba in front when he managed to tip Connor Murphy's shot from the right point past Kaapo Kahkonen with 6:17 left.\n\nKane then added an empty-netter with 1:03 left, completing his sixth career regular-season hat trick. He has a team-high 18 goals this season.\n\nThe Blackhawks host the Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday night.\n\nPacers Topple Hornets\n\nOn a Sunday when the Pacers relied heavily on their bench, Aaron Holiday scored 12 of his game-high 23 points in the final quarter of a 107-85 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nHoliday, who entered with a 9.3-point average, had his third consecutive double-digit game and was a point shy of a career high set last month at Brooklyn. He was coming off games of 18 and 13 points.\n\nThe cold-shooting Hornets managed to trim their deficit to 70-66 with a 22-13 third quarter.\n\nThe Pacers finished the final frame with a 35-19 edge. Thirty-one of their points came from the bench, which provided 55 for the game. Reserve guard T.J. McDonnell also had 12.\n\nDoug McDermott, a reserve guard who had not scored in three quarters, helped with a pair of 3-pointers early in the fourth. By the time Holiday hit his second 3-pointer of the game, the Pacers had a 93-75 lead with 4:54 remaining.\n\nThe Pacers held the Hornets to a season-low in points and shooting percentage (30.8). The visitors had a three-game winning streak snapped.\n\nPacers center Myles Turner scored 14 points with 10 rebounds. Domantas Sabonis added 12 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nHornets forward Cody Zeller, a Hoosier native who typically plays well in front of family and friends, had 19 points and 12 rebounds.

There have been flashes of high-level offensive play, and some lackluster performances as well.\n\nRodgers has a passer rating of over 100.0 in four different games this season, but also four with under 90.0. Running back Aaron Jones has four games with at least 150 yards from scrimmage and five with fewer than 50. Wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling emerged early on as the top contender for the No. 2 spot behind Davante Adams. But the 6-foot-4 speedster has two catches for 11 yards over the last six weeks. The Packers have scored 30 or more points in four games but also scored 20 or fewer in four other outings.\n\nGreen Bay (10-3) closes the season with three games against divisional opponents. First up is the 200th meeting with Chicago (7-6). The last time the Packers faced divisional foes in the last three weeks was 2016. They went 3-0.\n\nThe Bears need Mitch Trubisky to continue his solid run if they're going to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.\n\nThe former No. 2 overall pick has completed 70% of his passes for 860 yards, seven touchdowns and four interceptions with a 99.1 rating while leading Chicago to three straight wins. Though two of those games were against the New York Giants and Detroit Lions, he picked apart a top-10 defense last week in a 31-24 victory over the Cowboys.\n\nTrubisky matched a season-high by throwing for three touchdowns and ran for a score against Dallas. He completed 23 of 31 passes for 244 yards and ran for 63 yards, the most for him this year.\n\nISU Heads to North Dakota State for FCS Playoffs Quarterfinal Matchup\n\nFor the second week in a row, senior All-American running back James Robinson rushed for over 200 yards and led the Redbirds (10-4, 5-3 MVFC) to a 24-14 win over No. 8 national seed Central Arkansas in the second round of the FCS playoffs. With the win, ISU now heads to Fargo to face No. 1 North Dakota State (13-0, 8-0 MVFC) in the quarterfinals Saturday for the right to advance to the semifinals.\n\nNDSU set a new Football Championship Subdivision record with its 34th consecutive victory last Saturday, as the Bison pulled away from 19th-ranked Nicholls in the second half for a 37-13 win in the second round of the NCAA Division I Football Championship.\n\nNo. 1 ranked North Dakota State took advantage of early mistakes by No. 6 Illinois State and ran away with a 37-3 win over the Redbirds as part of Family Weekend on October 5 at Hancock Stadium.\n\nTop-ranked North Dakota State extended its record streak of MVFC championships to nine, thanks to perfect 8-0 league record in 2019. The nine-straight titles eclipsed the previous league record of seven-straight by UNI in the early 1990s.\n\nGame time Saturday is 11 am central time and action can be seen on ESPN.v\n\nBlues Double Up Vegas\n\nAfter missing the previous six games with a lower-body injury, Oskar Sundqvist had a goal and an assist as the St. Louis Blues beat the Vegas Golden Knights 4-2 on Thursday night.\n\nThe 25-year-old center kept up his offensive surge, assisting on the Blues' first goal and scoring their second. Sundqvist had two goals in his last game against Tampa Bay on Nov. 27 before getting hurt.\n\nMackenzie MacEachern, Jaden Schwartz and Robert Thomas also scored for the Blues, who snapped a three-game skid. Jordan Binnington made 27 saves after getting pulled from his previous start against Toronto last Saturday when he allowed four goals on 11 shots.\n\nMax Pacioretty and William Carrier had the goals for the Golden Knights, who lost for the third time in four games. Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 25 shots in his 820th career game, which tied Sean Burke for 14th on the NHL's all-time list.\n\nThe Blues took control with two goals in a 39-second span late in the second period.\n\nSchwartz gave the defending Stanley Cup champions a 3-2 lead with 5:07 left in the frame, ripping home a big rebound off a shot by Brayden Schenn. Thomas made it 4-2 moments later, beating Fleury short side on a shot that deflected off his arm.\n\nThe Blues avoided their first four-game streak without a point since February 2018. Earlier this season, St. Louis lost four straight in October but earned points with two overtime losses in that span.\n\nThe Blues host the Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday.\n\nAmericans Rally on Day 2 of President's Cup\n\nJustin Thomas delivered the biggest moment for an American team desperate for one Friday in the Presidents Cup.\n\nHe holed an 18-foot birdie putt on the final hole, dropped his putter and looked over at his partner — U.S. captain Tiger Woods — and then borrowed a line from former NFL receiver Terrell Owen.\n\nBuilding on a 4-1 lead after the opening session at Royal Melbourne, the Internation Team quickly won two more matches in foursomes.\n\nLouis Oosthuizen and Adam Scott rallied from 2 down by winning five of the next seven holes and closed out Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar in the opening foursomes match Friday.\n\nAt one point, the board was filled with black-and-gold, the new colors of this inspired International team led by Ernie Els.\n\nIt had to settled for a 6 1/2-3 1/2 lead.\n\nPatrick Cantlay and Thomas each birdied the 18th hole to win matches. Gary Woodland and Rickie Fowler rallied from 2 down with three holes to play to earn a halve.\n\nThe International team had its largest lead through two sessions since it won at Royal Melbourne in 1998, the only time it has won the Presidents Cup. It also had a three-point lead going into Sunday singles in South Africa in 2003, the year of the tie.\n\nThe match tied going to the 18th, Thomas drove into light rough on the right, and Woods followed with a great shot that landed near the hole and rolled out 18 feet. Hideki Matsuyama missed his 25-foot speedy birdie chance, and Thomas had the last putt for the win.\n\nEqually important was Cantlay, who second shot into the par-5 15th set up birdie to square the match. Xander Schauffele gave him a chance at the winner with an approach into 15 feet on the final hole, and Cantlay knocked it in.\n\nWoods tied Phil Mickelson for the record by winning his 26th match in bine Presidents Cup appearances. Mickelson played in 12.\n\nWoodland and Fowler capped off the late comeback. They were 2 down with three holes to go when they birdied the 16th and 17th holes to square the match against Sungjae Im and Cameron Smith. It ended with the first draw of these matches.\n\nWoods will be nothing but a captain Saturday morning. He took himself out of the lineup, sending Thomas in the first match out with Fowler for fourballs. Eight points are available Saturday, followed by 12 singles on Sunday.\n\nCoyotes Drop Blackhawks\n\nBrad Richardson had a goal and an assist, Clayton Keller scored twice and the Coyotes jumped out to a comfortable early lead on their way to a 5-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nVinnie Hinostroza, playing against his former team, assisted on all three of Arizona's first-period goals to match his career high for points in a game. He became the first Coyotes player in more than a year to have three assists in a single period.\n\nMichael Grabner and ex-Blackhawk Nick Schmaltz each added a goal for the Coyotes. Christian Dvorak had two assists and Keller tied a franchise record with 12 shots on goal during Arizona's fourth victory in six games.\n\nJonathan Toews and Dylan Strome, the Coyotes' top draft pick in 2015, scored for the Blackhawks, who lost their third straight.\n\nThe Coyotes had lost four of their past five home games. But they beat Chicago for the second time in five days and have won five of the last six meetings overall.\n\nDarcy Kuemper made 28 saves for Arizona. Robin Lehner stopped 35 shots for the Blackhawks.\n\nArizona got off to a flying start with two goals on its first four shots. Richardson fed Grabner with a long pass between the blue lines and he sped past a defender to get enough space for a backhand that found the net just 2:56 into the game.\n\nSpeed and a long pass were the difference again on the second goal, at 5:03 of the first. Jordan Oesterle sent a pass out of his own zone up the ice that Hinostroza deflected to Keller on a rush. Keller scored and crashed hard into the boards after his sixth of the season.\n\nThe Blackhawks are in St. Louis to take on the Blues on Saturday night.\n\nUrbana Blows By Monticello\n\nAs heard on WEZC and at dewittdailynews.com, Urbana came into Monticello Thursday night and blew by the Lady Sages 62-45 non-conference high school girls basketball action.\n\nThe Lady Tigers were paced by their three seniors.

Aaron Holiday gave Indiana a 105-104 lead with 4:16 left and Justin Holiday added gave Indiana a 114-109 lead with 1:26 left. Brogdon made six free throws in the last 17.1 seconds and Walker fired an airball on a 3 that would have tied it with 4 seconds to go.\n\nBoston's four-game winning streak ended.\n\nThe Pacers will try to extend their winning streak over the Hawks to six straight Friday in Atlanta.\n\nBulls Blast Hawks\n\nZach LaVine scored 35 points in three quarters, Lauri Markkanen added 22 and Chicago snapped a three-game losing streak with a 136-102 victory over the road-weary Hawks.\n\nLaVine, who sat out the final 14 minutes, was 12 for 15 from the field, including 7 for 7 from 3-point range.\n\nWendell Carter Jr. had 11 points and 10 rebounds and rookie Coby White had 19 points.\n\nTrae Young had 15 points and 13 assists, Alex Len scored 17 points and rookie Cam Reddish added 16 for Atlanta, which has dropped two straight and 13 of 15.\n\nThe Hawks were coming off a 135-121 overtime loss in Miami on Tuesday night - a game in which they led by six points with less than a minute remaining.\n\nChicago scored the final 10 points of the first half for a 66-52 lead at the break. LaVine led the way with 18 points on 7-for-9 shooting before the intermission.\n\nThe Bulls continued the surge and took their largest lead to that point, 93-69, on a layup by Carter with 4 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter.\n\nLaVine had 17 points in the third on 5-for-6 shooting, including 4 for 4 from long range, as Chicago took a 106-87 lead into the fourth.\n\nThe Bulls, who have blown big leads multiple times, put the game away with a 19-3 run early in the final quarter for a 125-93 lead.

The first playing captain in 25 years, he inserted himself in the first match and made six birdies, the most of anyone at Royal Melbourne.\n\nWhen it was over, the U.S. team found itself in foreign territory — trailing for the first time in 14 years.\n\nScott overcame a snap hook on the opening hole to make five birdies as he and Byeong Hun An — the replacement for Jason Day — won in 17 holes. Hideki Matsuyama holed a 25-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole that carried the Japanese star and C.T. Pan to a 1-up victory over Patrick Reed and Webb Simpson.\n\nOosthuizen and Abraham Ancer, the Mexican rookie who has received praise all week for his fire and confidence, opened with five straight birdies in a crushing defeat over the American power duo of Dustin Johnson and Gary Woodland.\n\nWoods was so strong that he decided to play again in Friday foursomes, again paired with Thomas. Woods kept two other teams together — Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele, and Reed and Simpson — even though both lost.\n\nEls is sending out five new partnerships, sticking to a plan that so far is working quite well.\n\nFormer Cardinals Pitcher Wacha Signs With Mets\n\n>>Former Cardinals Pitcher Wacha Signs With Mets\n\nThe New York Mets are have replaced outgoing free agent Zack Wheeler. The club has agreed to a one-year contract with free agent right-hander Michael Wacha, reports Tim Healey of Newsday. Joel Sherman of the New York Post says the deal is worth $3 million with $7 million in available incentives. The Mets have not yet confirmed an agreement.\n\nWacha, 28, was one of the youngest free agents on the market this offseason. He had the worst season of his career in 2019, throwing 126 2/6 innings with a 4.76 ERA and fewer than two strikeouts per walk with the Cardinals. Wacha dealt with a knee injury early in the season and was demoted to the bullpen briefly at midseason.\n\nWacha threw 84 1/3 innings with a 3.20 ERA in 2018, but a severe oblique strain ended his season in June. Only once in the last four years has Wacha thrown as many as 140 innings in a season. He's been held back by a series of injuries, including shoulder trouble a few years ago.\n\nThe Mets intend to bring righties Seth Lugo and Robert Gsellman to spring training as starting pitchers, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post, though they are likely to wind up back in the bullpen. Lugo was the club's most trusted bullpen arm late this past season.\n\nWacha is represented by CAA, Mets GM Brodie Van Wagenen's former agency. Since taking over as GM last year, Van Wagenen as signed or traded for several of his former clients, including Robinson Cano and Jed Lowrie. Wacha is now another member of that group.\n\n>>Anthony Rendon Signs With LA Angels\n\nThird baseman Anthony Rendon and the Los Angeles Angels agreed to a $245 million, seven-year contract Wednesday, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press.\n\nRendon gets a $4 million signing bonus payable by Dec. 31 and salaries of $25.5 million next season, $27.5 million in 2021, $36 million in 2022 and $38 million each year from 2023-26. He would receive a $250,000 bonus for World Series MVP, $150,000 for League Championship Series MVP, $125,000 for election as an All-Star starter and $100,000 for selection as a reserve.\n\nRendon is the third prized free agent to strike a big-money deal at this week’s baseball winter meetings. He’ll join three-time MVPs Mike Trout and Albert Pujols on a team that’s made just one postseason appearance in the past decade.\n\nThe Angels had missed out on free-agent right-hander Gerrit Cole, who agreed to a record $324 million, nine-year contract with the New York Yankees on Tuesday night.\n\nRendon, who has played all seven of his major league seasons with Washington, drove in a career-best 126 runs while helping the Nationals capture the franchise’s first World Series championship this year. His 19.9 Wins Above Replacement, per FanGraphs, over the past four seasons trails only Trout, Boston’s Mookie Betts and Milwaukee’s Christian Yelich among position players.\n\nRendon follows Bryce Harper as a homegrown star in Washington to leave via free agency — Harper signed a $330 million, 13-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies last March.\n\nBradley Beats D-III Maryville\n\nThe Bradley men's basketball team cruised to a 91-58 victory against Maryville on Tuesday night, posting the team's 10th-straight win at Carver Arena and improving to 7-3 on the season.\n\nJunior Elijah Childs led the Braves with 16 points and eight boards, while senior Nate Kennell and sophomore Ja'Shon Henry each chipped in 15 points. Kennell sunk four 3-pointers for his 15 points, while Henry added five rebounds for BU.\n\nSenior Darrell Brown paced the Bradley attack with nine assists as the Braves finished with 27 helpers as a team – their most in 13 seasons. Sophomore Ari Boya helped anchor the BU defense with a career-best four blocks.\n\nAfter holding a slight edge for much of the early portion of the game, Bradley firmly took control during the final six minutes of the first half. Holding a 26-19 lead, BU scored the final 20 points of the period to head into the locker room with a commanding 46-19 lead. Bradley made 8-of-10 field goals during the stretch, while the Saints missed their final 10 shots of the period to go with three turnovers for the 27-point edge at the intermission.\n\nThe Braves picked up in the second half right where they left off in the first. Kennell and Brown sunk triples on the team's first two possessions before Childs added a layup as Bradley extended its run to 28-straight points and a 54-19 lead. The Bradley advantage would reach as many as 41 points, 83-42, before picking up the final 91-58 victory.\n\nBradley shot a season-best 59.7 percent in the winning effort, including a 6-of-14 mark from beyond the arc (42.9 percent).

Illinois has played a ranked team only once this season and lost. Michigan beat Iowa by 12 at home on Friday.\n\nThe Wolverines are led by seniors Jon Teske and Zavier Simpson. Teske is averaging 14.1 points, 9.2 rebounds and 2.4 blocks while Simpson is accounting for 12.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 8.7 assists per contest.\n\nThe Fighting Illini have been led by Kofi Cockburn and Andres Feliz, who are averaging 15.4 and 14.3 points, respectively.\n\nIllinois is a perfect 6-0 when the team records at least 11 offensive rebounds. The Fighting Illini are 0-3 this season when they fail to reach that mark.\n\nThe Illini have recently gotten buckets via assists more often than the Wolverines. Illinois has an assist on 51 of 89 field goals (57.3 percent) over its past three contests while Michigan has assisted on 44 of 81 field goals (54.3 percent) during its past three games.\n\nIllinois has posted an excellent offensive rebound percentage of 42.8 percent this year. That rate is ranked first in Division 1. The offensive rebound percentage for Michigan stands at just 24.9 percent (ranked 270th).\n\nVegas Blasts Blackhawks\n\nMarc-Andre Fleury made 28 saves and the Vegas Golden Knights beat the Chicago Blackhawks 5-1 on Tuesday night in their goaltender's first game since the death of his father, Andre.\n\nReilly Smith, Deryk Engelland, William Karlsson, Max Pacioretty and Ryan Reaves scored for the Golden Knights, who now hit the road for two games on a 5-1-1 run.\n\nCorey Crawford, who dropped to 1-4-0 against Vegas, made 32 saves for Chicago, which played its third road game in six nights. Dominik Kubalik scored with 27 seconds left to spoil Fleury's bid for his 59th career shutout.\n\nAfter an evenly contested first period that saw both goaltenders come up with spectacular saves to keep their opponents off the scoreboard, Vegas was increasingly better in the second with the first seven shots on goal.\n\nWith less than a minute left in the second, Smith was masterful in forcing a turnover from Chicago veteran Jonathan Toews, streaking in on an odd-man rush and delaying just long enough to draw Crawford to his left before dishing to Karlsson, who finished with a short-handed goal to make it 3-0.\n\nPacioretty's goal made it 4-0 early in the third, and Reaves got his third of the season late in the period.\n\nThe Blackhawks continue their three-game road trip Thursday at Arizona.\n\nSabres Blast Blues\n\nJack Eichel scored two goals to extend his NHL-leading point streak to 14 games, and the Buffalo Sabres beat the St. Louis Blues 5-2 on Tuesday night.\n\nSam Reinhart, Johan Larsson and Zemgus Girgensons each had a goal and an assist as the Sabres won their second straight. Linus Ullmark made 28 saves.\n\nTroy Brouwer and Alex Pietrangelo had goals for the Blues, who have lost three in a row following a four-game winning streak. Jake Allen stopped 28 shots.\n\nEichel put the Sabres ahead 3-2 about six minutes into the third period. The Sabres’ captain handled the puck behind the net for several seconds before skating to the left slot and sending a wrist shot to the far corner.\n\nThe 14-game point streak for Eichel is the second-longest in the NHL this season, behind a 15-game stretch from Chicago’s Patrick Kane. Eichel has 12 goals and 13 assists during the streak.\n\nEichel scored into an empty net with two seconds remaining for his 20th goal of the season.\n\nGirgensons also scored an empty-netter in the final minute.\n\nThe Blues begin four-game homestand Thursday vs. Vegas.\n\nYankees Open The Vault for Cole\n\nThe New York Yankees landed the biggest prize of the free-agent market, adding Gerrit Cole to their rotation with a record $324 million, nine-year contract on Tuesday night, a person familiar with the deal told The Associated Press.\n\nCole’s deal established marks for pitchers in total dollars, topping the $245 million, seven-year contract Stephen Strasburg finalized a day earlier to remain with the World Series champion Washington Nationals.\n\nIts $36 million average is a record for any player, beating the $35.5 million in outfielder Mike Trout’s $426.5 million, 12-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels that started last season. Cole gets an even $36 million annually and can opt out after the 2024 season. He also has a full no-trade provision.\n\nA 29-year-old right-hander, Cole was baseball’s most dominant pitcher for much of 2019 and helped the Houston Astros come within one win of their second World Series title in three seasons.\n\nNew York has not won the World Series since 2009 and sought an ace to head a rotation that already includes Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka, James Paxton and J.A. Happ or Domingo Germán, who may be suspended at the season’s start under baseball’s domestic violence policy.\n\nCole will compliment a young core of hitters that includes Aaron Judge, Gleyber Torres and Gary Sánchez, entering a window when New York thinks it can compete consistently for championships.\n\nCole was drafted by the Yankees in the first round with the 28th overall pick out of high school in 2008 but chose to go to UCLA, then was drafted first overall by Pittsburgh three years later. Traded after the 2017 season, he transformed his career in two seasons with the Astros.\n\nHe went 15-5 with a 2.88 ERA in 2018, then 20-5 with a 2.50 ERA a major league-high 326 strikeouts last season, finishing second to teammate Justin Verlander in AL Cy Young Award balloting. Just 4-5 in late May, he went 19-0 over his next 25 starts before losing the World Series opener. He won Game 5 and was available to pitch in Game 7 but was never used.\n\nMonticello Beats Auburn For First Win of Season\n\nThe Monticello Sages picked up their first win of the season holding off Auburn 55-44 in non-conference high school boys basketball action Tuesday night from Monticello High School.\n\nGarrett Kepley scored a game-high 21 points and was aided by Ethan Miller’s 16 points, as the Sages finally found the offensive balance they’ve been striving for in the early portion of the season.\n\nMonticello jumped out to a quick 9-0 lead against Salt Fork Friday night but the Storm battled back and ultimately won on a last-second shot. The Sages quickly jumped out to a 9-0 lead again Tuesday but after the Trojans made it 13-8 after one quarter, Miller made three-consecutive three-pointers to put Monticello up 22-8.\n\nBriggs Fultz scored the final four points of the quarter to stake Monticello to a 26-15 lead at the half.\n\nAuburn battled back in the third quarter to cut the deficit to 39-32 going to the fourth quarter thanks to 12-2 run after Kepley started the second half with a quick "
