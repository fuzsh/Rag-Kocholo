Amazon is dragging out the year's biggest shopping holiday(s) into 11 days of deals. The retail giant began its Black Friday sale in the early morning of Friday, Nov. 17 (a week ahead of schedule) and was on top of making the switch to Cyber Monday language in the wee hours of Saturday, Nov. 25. Official Cyber Monday mode, which is currently on through Monday, Nov. 27, includes both a ton of deals carried over from Black Friday plus some new ones. We're curating a running list of Amazon's best Cyber Weekend deals, spotlighting some of our favorites and noting when good deals inevitably sell out. Read on for the full rundown, and check back often: We're going to be updating this story incessantly as the sale continues, as well as our even bigger (if you can imagine) list of Cyber Monday deals across more retailers. Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ‚ú®, while deals with a üî• have dropped to an all-time low price. Amazon's invite-only deals for Prime members are marked with a üì®. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing. Echo, Fire TV, and Kindle deals Why we like it An Echo Show is a subtle yet game-changing addition to any room ‚Äî and for less than $40 with this rollover Black Friday to Cyber Monday deal, there's little reason to not make your life easier. The smart screen responds to Alexa commands that are particularly handy when your hands are full, like asking for measurement conversions mid-cooking, checking the weather mid-rushing out the door, or turning off your smart lights with a sleeping kid in hand. Plus, it's got a 5.5-inch screen and better sound than its predecessor, making it perfect for watching videos or video calling friends and family.

Compared to the 9th gen, the 10th gen classic iPad has a slightly bigger screen that's now also a Liquid Retina display (10.9 inches versus 10.2 inches), a faster A14 Bionic chip for smoother multitasking, and USB-C charging.

This 25% discount drops the 2023 version to the regular asking price of our favorite budget laptop, the older Surface Go 2. Compared to the Go 2, the Go 3's Intel Core i5 processor is 12th gen versus the Go 2's 11th gen, harnessing better speeds and solid power for most everyday work or school tasks. On the outside, the Go 3 is definitely giving MacBook Air ‚Äî the main difference being that the Go 3's screen is a touchscreen.

Betashares said it was part of a longer-term strategy to expand the business into the broader financial sector. Shares in Bendigo increased 0.6 per cent on the news. REITS (up 0.4 per cent) was the strongest sector on the index as Goodman added 0.5 per cent and Dexus climbed 2.8 per cent. The laggards Casino operator Star Entertainment Group‚Äôs shares hit an all-time low of 60¬¢ after it raised $565 million. They closed the session 16 per cent weaker at 63¬¢. Star, which raised $800 million in February, has had to return to the market for fresh funding and is hoping to raise $750 million at a share price of 60¬¢ a share. Meanwhile, healthcare heavyweight CSL shed 1.4 per cent, weighing down the healthcare sector and insurance companies IAG (down 2.6 per cent) and Suncorp (down 2 per cent) gave back some of their gains from Tuesday. Gold miners Newcrest (down 2.1 per cent) and Evolution (down 3.5 per cent) were also among the biggest large-cap decliners after the spot gold price dropped 0.9 per cent overnight. Information technology (down 1.1 per cent) was the weakest sector on the local bourse with WiseTech losing 1.4 per cent. The lowdown Novus Capital senior client adviser Gary Glover said the Australian sharemarket was surprisingly resilient following a negative lead from Wall Street and the latest inflation data, with markets starting to wake up to the fact that interest rates could stay higher for longer. ‚ÄúConsidering the damage overnight in the US, Australian markets held on pretty well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI thought it would be a bigger down day across the board.‚Äù Glover said the market was volatile but quite range-bound, similar to previous periods of high inflation in the 1940s and 1970s. Elsewhere, Wall Street‚Äôs ugly September got even worse on Tuesday, as a sharp drop for stocks brought them back to where they were in June. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.5 per cent for its fifth loss in the last six days. The Dow Jones dropped 1.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.6 per cent. Loading September has brought a loss of 5.2 per cent so far for the S&P 500, putting it on track to be the worst month of the year by far, as the realisation sets in that the Federal Reserve will indeed keep interest rates high for a long time. That growing understanding has sent yields in the bond market to their highest levels in more than a decade, which in turn has undercut prices for stocks and other investments. Treasury yields rose again on Tuesday following a mixed batch of reports on the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.55 per cent from 4.54 per cent late on Monday and is near its highest level since 2007. It‚Äôs up sharply from about 3.5 per cent in May and from 0.5 per cent about three years ago. One economic report on Tuesday showed confidence among consumers was weaker than economists expected. That‚Äôs concerning because strong spending by US households has been a bulwark keeping the economy out of a long-predicted recession. Besides high interest rates, a long list of other worries is also tugging at Wall Street. The most immediate is the threat of another US government shutdown as Capitol Hill threatens a stalemate that could shut off federal services across the country. Loading Wall Street has dealt with such shutdowns in the past, and stocks have historically been turbulent in the run-up to them, according to Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. After looking at the seven shutdowns that lasted 10 days or more since the 1970s, she found the S&P 500 dropped an average of roughly 10 per cent in the three months heading into them. But stocks managed to hold up rather well during the shutdowns, falling an average of just 0.3 per cent, before rebounding meaningfully afterward. Wall Street is also contending with higher oil prices, shaky economies around the world, a strike by US autoworkers that could put more upward pressure on inflation and a resumption of US student-loan repayments that could dent spending by households. On Wall Street, the vast majority of stocks fell under such pressures, including 90 per cent of those within the S&P 500. Big Tech stocks tend to be among the hardest hit by high rates, and they were the heaviest weights on the index. Apple fell 2.3 per cent and Microsoft lost 1.7 per cent. Amazon tumbled 4 per cent after the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit against it. They accuse the e-commerce behemoth of using its dominant position to inflate prices on other platforms, overcharge sellers and stifle competition. In China, concerns continued over heavily indebted real estate developer Evergrande. The property market crisis there is dragging on China‚Äôs economic growth and raising worries about financial instability. France‚Äôs CAC 40 fell 0.7 per cent, and Germany‚Äôs DAX lost 1 per cent. Crude oil prices rose, adding to worries about inflation. A barrel of benchmark US crude climbed 71¬¢ to $US90.39. Brent crude, the international standard, added 67¬¢ to $US93.96 per barrel.

Watchara Phomicinda | MediaNews Group | The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images It was late in the day on Oct. 27, 2021, when Fred Ruckel received the dreaded automated email from Amazon . Amazon‚Äôs software had detected that Ruckel‚Äôs popular cat toy, called the Ripple Rug, was being sold somewhere else for a cheaper price. His product would no longer be shown in Amazon‚Äôs all-important buy box, an area of the listing where shoppers click ‚ÄúAdd to Cart.‚Äù Ruckel is the sole seller of the Ripple Rug on Amazon, so the move all but ensured his product would disappear from the website, costing him thousands of dollars per day. ‚ÄúBelow is a list of product(s) in your catalog that are not currently eligible to be the Featured Offer because they are not priced competitively compared to prices for those products from retailers outside Amazon,‚Äù according to the email, which was viewed by CNBC. Unbeknownst to him, Chewy was running a discount promotion, and dropped the price of his product by a few dollars to $39.99 ‚Äì less than the $43 offer on Amazon. The algorithm had flagged it as a lower offer, even though the item on Chewy cost $48.54 after shipping and taxes. Ruckel had to make a choice: Lower the price on Amazon or ask Chewy to raise the price of his product. He opted for the latter. Fred Ruckel's company Snuggly Cat makes Ripple Rug, an interactive play mat for cats. Fred Ruckel Nearly three years later, Ruckel‚Äôs experience hits at the core of a sweeping antitrust lawsuit filed last week by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon. The agency accused Amazon of wielding its monopoly power to squeeze merchants and thwart rivals. For consumers, that‚Äôs led to artificially inflated prices and a degraded shopping experience, the agency alleges. In the 172-page suit, the FTC said Amazon relies on an ‚Äúanti-discounting strategy‚Äù and a ‚Äúmassive web-crawling apparatus that constantly tracks online prices‚Äù to stifle competition. The agency said Amazon punishes third-party sellers who offer cheaper products elsewhere by threatening to disqualify them from appearing in the buy box if it detects a lower price. Losing the buy box is an ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù to sellers‚Äô businesses, the complaint alleges. The end result of these tactics, the FTC argues, is elevated prices across the web. The company steadily hikes the fees it charges sellers and prevents them from discounting on other sites, so sellers often inflate their prices off of Amazon, creating an ‚Äúartificial price floor everywhere,‚Äù according to the complaint. The FTC is seeking to hold Amazon liable for allegedly violating anti-monopoly law, though it has not yet outlined the specific remedies it believes would best resolve its concerns. In antitrust cases, remedies are often determined only after a court finds the defendant liable. In a blog post, Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky said third-party sellers set their own prices on the marketplace. The company also invests in tools to help sellers offer ‚Äúcompetitive prices,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven with those tools, some of the businesses selling on Amazon might still choose to set prices that aren‚Äôt competitive,‚Äù Zapolsky said. ‚ÄúJust like any store owner who wouldn‚Äôt want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don‚Äôt highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced.‚Äù Zapolsky argued the FTC‚Äôs lawsuit could force it to stop highlighting low prices, ‚Äúa perverse result that would be directly opposed to the goals of antitrust law.‚Äù ‚ÄúLong overdue‚Äù lawsuit On Amazon‚Äôs own forum for merchants, called Seller Central, several users cheered on the FTC and said they hoped it would result in changes to the company‚Äôs business practices. Amazon‚Äôs tense relationship with merchants has been well-chronicled over the years, with sellers expressing a range of grievances over issues like rising fees, an arcane suspensions process, and heightened competition on the marketplace from all sides, including the e-commerce giant. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs great, Amazon deserves it,‚Äù one person commented, adding, ‚ÄúMore should be coming on the way.‚Äù Amazon in recent years made the forum anonymous, but users must have a seller account in order to post. Another post included a screenshot of a message Amazon sent to sellers the day after the FTC filed its complaint, which said, ‚ÄúAs your partners, we know that this news may generate questions for you and our business together. This lawsuit does not change anything about our relationship with you or how we operate today.‚Äù One user called it ‚ÄúBS verbiage,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúBusinesses that sell in their store are indeed customers. And which of us has gotten good customer service?‚Äù Another user described their experience in the last 12 months of selling on Amazon as ‚Äúbeing up all night at an effing casino but I'm stuck, the drugs are starting to wear off, but I'm trying to break even on the mortgage payment I'm using to play. That's how it is selling on Amazon right now to me.‚Äù The seller went on to describe the experience as a ‚Äúrace to the bottom.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's long overdue,\" another commenter wrote. \"When they close me down, I'm applying for a job with the FTC.‚Äù Still, others commented that the FTC‚Äôs complaint is misguided. ‚ÄúSelling on Amazon is a life-changing opportunity and the amount of sellers that throw stones at the platform is astounding,‚Äù one user wrote. Seller skepticism Even sellers who may be sympathetic to the idea of regulating Amazon have concerns, specifically that the FTC's highlighted issues aren't necessarily ones that would make the seller and consumer experience better. Scott Needham, who sells on Amazon and runs a product-finder tool for other Amazon sellers, said he was ‚Äúsurprised by some of the points that the FTC selected.‚Äù watch now ‚ÄúI have over the years been very critical of Amazon,‚Äù Needham told CNBC. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost a lot of sleep because of some of the things that they have done. And the issues that they brought up, while they are interesting, they haven‚Äôt created me a lot of pain.‚Äù Needham said he was particularly puzzled by the inclusion of the claims that Amazon is coercive in the way it encourages sellers to use its fulfillment service, known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. Needham said many sellers ‚Äúlove FBA‚Äù because of its compelling value in terms of the price and promise to deliver two-day shipping. For many, using FBA doesn‚Äôt feel like a requirement, but they believe using it will make their businesses \"easier and more effective.\" \"I think that the power that Amazon wields over sellers is considerable and absolutely worth looking into,‚Äù Needham said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not sure if this would actually change that.‚Äù Scott Moller, an Amazon seller and co-founder of an agency that helps merchants run their storefronts, said the e-commerce giant has removed some of the challenges that used to be part of running an online business. With FBA, he said, he can ship an item into one of Amazon‚Äôs warehouses for $7.49 per package, while shipping it himself through a traditional carrier would cost him about $12. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to have my own warehouse,‚Äù said Moller, who sells grilling accessories on Amazon under the brand Grill Sergeant. ‚ÄúI can use their staff, their storage, and I can instantly also take the data of advertising, so I can target ads.‚Äù He also disputed the FTC‚Äôs claim that Amazon has become littered with ads in search results, causing shoppers to wade through potentially less-relevant products of lesser quality. ‚ÄúWe can tailor our ads to hit exactly the consumers we want,‚Äù Moller said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a perfect marriage of a transaction, and that‚Äôs one of the beauties of what their marketplace offers.‚Äù Needham said he feels he would have been more supportive of the case if it were filed a few years ago, pre-pandemic. At that time, he said, \"I would have felt, yes Amazon is a monopoly‚Ä¶ But actually after Covid, into 2023, ecommerce has had a lot of big changes.‚Äù He added, \"The competition is just not what it was in 2019.\" Competitors like Shopify and Walmart are increasingly viable alternatives for many categories of sellers, Needham said, not to mention rapidly growing Chinese e=commerce companies like Temu. As a result, Needham said he‚Äôs seen some significant changes from Amazon. Among those is a greater ability for Amazon sellers to communicate with buyers, offering select customers certain promotions. Shopify, for example, gives sellers much more control over how they communicate with customers, Needham said, adding that although Amazon still controls the communication process, at least there is one. \"I wish it was a clear-cut case,‚Äù Needham said. ‚ÄúI have a vested interest in the marketplace doing really well, as a seller and as a service provider. And... this case, it doesn‚Äôt make the marketplace better for sellers.\" Concerns over Amazon pricing policies, fees Many sellers have zeroed in on Amazon‚Äôs pricing policies and rising fees as rightful areas of concern in the FTC's lawsuit. Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon, has been a longtime critic of Amazon‚Äôs pricing policies. Hart complained of how Amazon‚Äôs seller fees impact pricing in a 2019 Medium post and later that year testified about his experience before a House committee. Hart said Amazon sales comprise about 90% of his business, meaning any hit those sales take on Amazon has a considerable impact. He recalled ‚Äú24 anxious hours‚Äù in September 2022 when a third-party seller of his popular construction toy Brain Flakes listed the toy for a lower price on Target than it was offered on Amazon.

Here are the top players and storylines to monitor for Monday's slate. Las Vegas Raiders (6-8) at Kansas City Chiefs (9-5) | 1 p.m. ET New chapter in Patrick Mahomes-Maxx Crosby rivalry: This hasn't been as much of a rivalry between the teams as of late, with Kansas City holding a 10-1 record over the Raiders since Mahomes became its starting quarterback. Yet it has sparked an exciting feud between the two-time Super Bowl MVP and the two-time Pro Bowler Crosby, who has five sacks in nine career games against the Chiefs. Mahomes and Crosby might not like facing one another, though it's clear there's mutual respect between the two, which only makes their rivalry more intriguing to watch. Can Raiders QB Aidan O‚ÄôConnell earn next season‚Äôs starting job?: After leading the offense on seven touchdown scoring drives in last week's 63-21 win over the Chargers, the rookie fourth-rounder aims to further establish himself as a serious contender for Las Vegas' starting job next season. Despite the encouraging performance, O'Connell has been inconsistent across six games as the full-time starter, throwing for 1,300 yards, seven touchdowns, and five interceptions. However, a stellar showing against the NFL's fifth-ranked pass defense (202.5 yards per game allowed) would benefit his bid to be the starter in 2024. Chiefs TE Travis Kelce: Yes, his girlfriend will be in town for the holiday. Kelce is averaging 89.6 yards per game with global popstar Taylor Swift in attendance this season but is coming off his worst outing in her presence, catching five passes for 28 yards. Even so, Kelce's 81.3 average receiving yards per game against the Raiders since 2019 suggests the All-Pro tight end is in line for a productive outing and could potentially snap his four-game scoring drought. New York Giants (5-9) at Philadelphia Eagles (10-4) | 4:30 p.m. ET Will the Eagles defense shake off the rust?: Appointing Matt Patricia as defensive play-caller didn't change much for the Eagles, whose defense has given up the third-most points in the NFL over their current three-game losing streak (95). Although the unit has reached its lowest point, there are reasons to be optimistic about Monday's matchup. New York ranks 31st among teams in points and yards per game this season and has surrendered a staggering 76 sacks, the third-most in a single season in NFL history. Not to mention, the annual trip to Philadelphia has essentially been a scheduled loss for the Giants, with their last win at Lincoln Financial Field coming in 2013. Can QB Jalen Hurts and the Eagles offense finally bounce back?: Philadelphia's defense isn't the only unit that needs to rebound, as the offense has struggled mightily over the last three games, with Hurts' ineffectiveness playing a significant role. After averaging the third-most points in the NFL over the first 11 games (28.2), the Eagles have scored four offensive touchdowns during their current skid, three of which came via the \"tush push.\" The Eagles may have difficulty throwing against a solid Giants pass defense, though they could alleviate some of their offensive woes by running the ball efficiently. New York gives up 131.6 rushing yards per game, the fourth-most in the league. Does Giants QB Tommy DeVito have any magic left?: The Giants may have a terrible offense, but this unit has operated at its best under DeVito, an undrafted rookie and native of Cedar Grove, New Jersey. DeVito has thrown for 858 yards, seven touchdowns, and one interception in five games since being named New York's starting quarterback, posting the 13th-highest passer rating in the NFL during that stretch (97.3). Baltimore Ravens (11-3) at San Francisco 49ers (11-3) | 8:15 p.m. ET Potential Super Bowl sneak peek and MVP implications: Easily the most hyped game of the week, with the top seed in each respective conference squaring off in what could be a potential Super Bowl LVIII preview as well as the decisive clash for the MVP Award. According to oddschecker, 49ers QB Brock Purdy is listed as the heavy favorite to be named league MVP (-230), while Baltimore signal-caller Lamar Jackson holds the second-shortest odds (+525). Purdy, the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, has seen his career unfold as if it were a fairy tale that just keeps getting more remarkable. The 23-year-old ranks first in the NFL in QBR (76) and touchdown passes (29) while ranking third in passing yards (3,795), all of which are especially impressive considering he's coming off offseason elbow surgery. Jackson might not be posting the ridiculous numbers he did during his 2019 MVP campaign, but the adjustment in his play style in his first season under OC Todd Monken has led to sustainable, winning football. Nevertheless, Baltimore needs an upset win for Jackson to capture another MVP Award, as he has thrown for 3,105 yards and 17 touchdowns while adding 741 yards on the ground with five scores this season. 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey: If Purdy wasn't playing at such a high level ‚Äî and the MVP wasn't a quarterback-driven award ‚Äî it'd be difficult to argue against McCaffrey taking home the honors. McCaffrey, who seems poised to win the Offensive Player of the Year Award, leads the NFL in rushing (1,292 yards) and total yards per game (128.6) this season and is tied for first in touchdowns (20). Ravens TE Isaiah Likely thriving in the starting role: The Ravens offense hasn't lost a step since losing one of the team's top weapons in tight end Mark Andrews (ankle) in Week 11, largely due to Likely's emergence. The second-year tight end has averaged 64.3 yards over his last three games, which is particularly noteworthy since Andrews averaged 54.4 yards per game before sustaining his injury. Should we expect a defensive battle?: While both teams boast offenses that rank in the top five in yardage and scoring, this may not turn into a shootout. The Ravens defense has allowed the fewest points per game this season (16.1) and second-fewest total yards (4,030), while San Francisco's unit ranks second in points (16.7) and 10th in yardage (310 per game). The 49ers defense might be slightly inferior statistically, but it could have more of an impact in this matchup. San Francisco has racked up an NFL-leading 25 turnovers and has given up the second-fewest rushing yards (1,252), which should help slow down the team with the league's most effective running game.\n\nChristmas Day preview: 49ers, Ravens square off in potential Super Bowl sneak peek\n\nhttps://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/christmas_day_preview_49ers_ravens_square_off_in_potential_super_bowl_sneak_peek/s1_13132_39720250\n\nYardbarker\n\nsports\n\nDan Treacy\n\n2023-10-30T22:20:03+00:00\n\nThe Lions just needed to get themselves back in the win column after a blowout loss in Baltimore, and they did just that in front of their home fans on Monday night. Detroit rolled to a 26-14 victory over the Raiders in a game that felt much more one-sided than the score indicates. The Lions thoroughly outplayed the Raiders, out-gaining Las Vegas by 329 yards, but critical mistakes by Detroit left points on the board. The offense struggled to turn red zone opportunities into touchdowns in the first half, and two turnovers deep in Raiders territory -- including a pick-six by Jared Goff -- kept Las Vegas in the game in the second half. MORE: What to know about Lions' retro 'Honolulu blue' helmets Nonetheless, the Lions' defense dominated. The Raiders were abysmal on the offensive side of the ball, outside of a second-quarter touchdown drive led by Josh Jacobs. Jimmy Garoppolo completed just 10 passes, badly missing a wide-open Davante Adams on multiple occasions. Adams was seen slamming his helmet down on the sideline in the fourth quarter, and it's tough to blame the star receiver after an 11-yard performance that could have been exponentially better with better quarterback play. The story of the night was Lions rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, who finally broke through after entering the season with sky-high expectations. Tasked with leading the backfield in David Montgomery's absence, Gibbs exploded for 189 scrimmage yards and a touchdown in the win. It was the first 100-yard rushing performance of his career. Meanwhile, Amon-Ra St. Brown notched his third consecutive 100-yard game despite entering Monday as questionable with an illness. MORE: Why Davante Adams is unlikely to be traded before deadline The Lions enter their bye in sole possession of the No. 2 seed in the NFC, while the Raiders drop their second consecutive game against an NFC North opponent and have what might be a must-win game against the Giants in Week 9 if they want any chance to linger in the AFC playoff race.

Raiders vs. Lions final score 1 2 3 4 Final Raiders 0 7 7 0 14 Lions 3 13 7 3 26 Raiders vs. Lions results, highlights from 'Monday Night Football' (All times Eastern) Final: Lions 26, Raiders 14 11:15 p.m. ‚Äî That'll do it! The Lions bounce back and move to 6-2 with the win over Las Vegas. Detroit left points on the board, but the Raiders were thoroughly outplayed in this one. 11:09 p.m. ‚Äî The Lions get the ball back and will try to ice the game at this point. 11:08 p.m. ‚Äî Adding insult to injury, Garoppolo is sacked for the sixth time tonight. It's 4th & 17. 11:07 p.m. ‚Äî Davante Adams has had his way with Cameron Sutton at times tonight, and Garoppolo has just not made the throw each time. It happens again here on what would've been a game-changing play. Garoppolo has had a brutal night. 11:04 p.m. ‚Äî Riley Patterson missed a 26-yard field goal attempt after making his first four attempts tonight. Strange. The Lions can't come away with points on that drive. 11:01 p.m. ‚Äî What would've been a Reynolds touchdown is erased by a holding penalty. That does give the Lions a chance to erase some more time on the clock, though. 11:00 p.m. ‚Äî Craig Reynolds, up to 66 yards, has the Lions on the verge of the end zone. 10:58 p.m. ‚Äî Garoppolo is sacked AGAIN. It's Anzalone for the second time on the drive, and that sends the ball right back to the Lions. 10:56 p.m. ‚Äî Now the Lions sack Garoppolo on back-to-back plays as Alex Anzalone and Alim McNeill come in to send the Raiders to 3rd & 28. 10:53 p.m. ‚Äî Garoppolo hits Jakobi Meyers for a big 19 yards to give the Raiders something to work with. 10:51 p.m. ‚Äî The Garoppolo-to-Adams connection is just not working tonight. Adams was all by himself downfield, and Garoppolo throws it well out of bounds. Lions 26, Raiders 14 10:46 p.m. FIELD GOAL ‚Äî 52 yards? No problem for Patterson, who extends the Lions' lead to 12. 10:45 p.m. ‚Äî Kalif Raymond was set up for a big play, but Goff's throw was just a bit behind him. That will get Riley Patterson on the field for a 52-yard field goal try. 10:43 p.m. ‚Äî Goff gets pushed forward on 4th & 1 to keep the Lions' drive alive. They're into Raiders territory, trying to ice this game. 10:36 p.m. ‚Äî Gibbs is just wearing down this Raiders defense for chunks of yards. He's up to 179 scrimmage yards and has the Lions moving down the field again. End of third quarter: Lions 23, Raiders 14 10:32 p.m. ‚Äî Gibbs turns what looked like little or no gain into a first down. He has 126 yards on the ground. 10:31 p.m. ‚Äî Alim McNeill sacks Garoppolo for an 8-yard loss, ending Las Vegas' drive. Aside from the second quarter drive dominated by Jacobs, the Raiders' offense has shown nothing tonight. Garoppolo has just 62 yards through nearly three quarters. 10:28 p.m. ‚Äî Michael Mayer gets the Raiders' drive started with a big 19-yard gain. That's the rookie's first catch of the night. Lions 23, Raiders 14 10:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN ‚Äî There goes Jahmyr Gibbs! It's the rookie's night. He takes off for a 27-yard touchdown with his blazing speed and has 149 scrimmage yards on the night. More importantly, he gives the Lions a two-possession lead. 10:23 p.m. ‚Äî A pass interference call gives the Lions 18 yards and takes them well into Raiders territory after starting the drive with strong field position. 10:18 p.m. ‚Äî The Lions quickly get the Raiders off the field, and a bad drop by Davante Adams on third down is the culprit. The throw was a bit low, but Adams still had it in his grasp for a second. Las Vegas will punt. 10:16 p.m. ‚Äî It was hard to find a conclusive angle of what happened there, but Lions fans are making it known they think Reynolds was down. It doesn't matter. It's Raiders ball with a chance for Las Vegas to take the lead. 10:13 p.m. FUMBLE ‚Äî For now, the Raiders force a fumble by Reynolds and instantly end the Lions' drive. Maxx Crosby ripped it right out of his arms. Was he down? That's what officials are taking a closer look at. 10:11 p.m. ‚Äî Another first down by Gibbs, who has 116 scrimmage yards, and the Lions have 1st & Goal. 10:09 p.m. ‚Äî Officials come out to measure whether Craig Reynolds got a first down...and he did. On the next play, Reynolds catches a pass from Goff for 12 yards. The Lions are in business on the verge of the red zone. 10:06 p.m. ‚Äî The Lions have gotten over midfield with two early first downs as they try to steal the momentum back. St. Brown is up to 108 yards on the night. Lions 16, Raiders 14 10:01 p.m. PICK-SIX ‚Äî Marcus Peters picks off Goff and runs it 74 yards back for the touchdown! Amon-Ra St. Brown didn't have his eye on the throw from Goff, but Peters did. The Raiders are right back in this game. 10:00 p.m. ‚Äî There goes Jahmyr Gibbs! The rookie breaks tackles for a bruising 24-yard run. He's up to 97 scrimmage yards tonight. 9:56 p.m. ‚Äî Julian Okwara sacks Garoppolo on third down, forcing a Raiders punt. The Lions didn't want to let Las Vegas build any momentum to start the half, and mission accomplished. 9:55 p.m. ‚Äî It's quickly 3rd & 9 to start this third quarter after Davante Adams unsuccessfully looks for a pass interference call. End of first half: Lions 16, Raiders 7 9:39 p.m. ‚Äî The Raiders run one play but elect to go to the half. They'll start the second half with the ball and could use at least some points on that drive if they want to stay in this game. Lions 16, Raiders 7 9:36 p.m. TOUCHDOWN ‚Äî LaPorta's great rookie season rolls on! The rookie picks up his fourth touchdown of the season and extends the Lions' lead. Detroit found success running the ball early, but that drive featured nice work from Goff. 16-7. Lions. 9:35 p.m. ‚Äî LaPorta picks up a first down for the Lions, and now Dan Campbell is going to start using his timeouts with 31 seconds left in the half. Detroit is at the Raiders' 18-yard line. 9:33 p.m. ‚Äî St. Brown picks up another first down for the Lions as they enter field goal range again. St. Brown is up to 94 yards in the first half after entering the day listed as questionable. 9:30 p.m. ‚Äî What would've been a horsecollar penalty on a nice Gibbs run is offset by a holding call. The fans don't like it. 9:26 p.m. ‚Äî There's a welcomed sight for Lions fans: Goff hits Jameson Williams for a 22-yard gain. Williams was held without a catch despite six targets in Baltimore last week. 9:25 p.m. ‚Äî Crosby is doing so much more than just getting to the quarterback tonight. He wraps up Gibbs, the third time tonight he's had an explosive play on a ball-carrier. 9:21 p.m. TOUCHDOWN ‚Äî That was a statement drive by the Raiders. Jacobs looked like the dominant runner he was last season and takes it in himself for the game's first touchdown. 9:20 p.m. ‚Äî Davante Adams doesn't have a single catch tonight, but Jacobs has 12 touches. Right now, it's starting to work. The Raiders are set up with 1st & Goal. 9:19 p.m. ‚Äî The Raiders are quickly into the red zone after another nice gain for Josh Jacobs. 9:17 p.m. ‚Äî Las Vegas' offense is moving much smoother now as Austin Hooper picks up another first down. Hooper has two catches on this drive. 9:15 p.m. ‚Äî It's back-to-back first downs for the Raiders, with the help of a 15-yard penalty on Aidan Hutchinson for a low block. Lions 9, Raiders 0 9:11 p.m. FIELD GOAL ‚Äî The Lions' drive fizzles almost instantly, so it's back to Riley Patterson's leg for another field goal. Detroit leads, 9-0. 9:09 p.m. ‚Äî Momentum swings abound. St. Brown comes right back with a 24-yard catch to make up the lost yardage and much more. 9:08 p.m. ‚Äî Maxx Crosby blows up another play, this time dropping Jameson Williams for a loss of six. 9:06 p.m. ‚Äî Big play alert! Goff hits an open Amon-Ra St. Brown, who goes 44 yards to breathe life into the Lions' offense. 9:03 p.m. ‚Äî The Raiders' offense continues to have nothing in the tank. Las Vegas gains four yards and is forced to punt after less than a minute with the ball. Lions 6, Raiders 0 8:58 p.m. FIELD GOAL ‚Äî Detroit was simply trying to draw the Raiders offsides. It didn't work. Riley Patterson's field goal is good, and the Lions extend their lead to six. 8:56 p.m. ‚Äî Raymond makes up some yardage on fourth down but comes up about eight yards short of the goal line. The Lions may be considering going for it... 8:55 p.m. ‚Äî The Lions are moving backwards after a holding call on Taylor Decker. End of first quarter: Lions 3, Raiders 0 8:51 p.m. ‚Äî Goff comes under heavy pressure on 3rd & 11 but finds a wide open Kalif Raymond for the first down. The Lions are into the red zone. 8:49 p.m. ‚Äî There's Amon-Ra St. Brown. Goff hits him on back-to-back plays for a total of 20 yards. 8:47 p.m. ‚Äî Garoppolo's fourth down pass goes to no man's land after Hunter Renfrow falls down. The Lions will be set up not too far from field goal range. 8:46 p.m. ‚Äî The Raiders will go for it on 4th & 2 from about midfield... 8:43 p.m. ‚Äî The Raiders' defense rises to the challenge and forces a quick three-and-out. Detroit is punting for the first time tonight. 8:38 p.m. INTERCEPTION ‚Äî And just like that... Jimmy Garoppolo turns it over. That can't happen. Kerby Joseph picks it off just in front of the end zone and gets the ball back to the Lions' offense two plays after the fumble. 8:36 p.m. FUMBLE ‚Äî A big mistake from Josh Reynolds, who loses the ball after a catch and sees it quickly scooped up by the Raiders. It's Las Vegas ball deep in Lions territory. 8:33 p.m. ‚Äî Garoppolo fights hard for the first down, using his legs and taking a big hit, but he comes up a yard short. The Raiders will punt. 8:31 p.m. ‚Äî A flag flies on the Raiders' first offensive snap, but it's picked back up as Josh Jacobs takes a pass 12 yards for a quick first down. Lions 3, Raiders 0 8:26 p.m. FIELD GOAL ‚Äî The Lions' running game stalls out, but not before they worked their way into field goal range. Riley Patterson drills one from 44 yards out to put Detroit in front early. 8:22 p.m. ‚Äî With Gibbs getting a breather, Craig Reynolds comes in and delivers a bruising 11-yard run. The Lions are bullying their way down the field. 8:21 p.m. ‚Äî Is this the Jahmyr Gibbs game? He already has six touches and just ran his way to another first down. 8:19 p.m. ‚Äî Gibbs picks up another Lions first down on a catch-and-run. He's heavily involved in the offense early on with David Montgomery out. 8:18 p.m. ‚Äî Goff hands off to Jahmyr Gibbs on the first two snaps of the night, and he hits Sam LaPorta on third down to convert. Nice start for the Lions' rookie class tonight. 8:15 p.m. ‚Äî The Lions will start with the ball, and we are underway! 8:07 p.m. ‚Äî As the broadcast points out, this is a homecoming for Michigan native Maxx Crosby. The play of him and fellow Michigan native Aidan Hutchinson will be pivotal tonight. 7:56 p.m. ‚Äî Josh Jacobs hasn't averaged more than 3.6 yards per carry in a single game this season. Can he get going against a strong Lions run defense? It'll be tough to win without at least some production from the former first-rounder. 7:40 p.m. ‚Äî On that note...

The matchup sees the Roadrunners as large betting favorites on odds boards. Currently, USTA is favored by on the point spread, with Marshall available for on the moneyline. The Roadrunners are in their 13th season as a program but have yet to win a bowl game. This is the fourth bowl game they've played in five years. Marshall is competing in a bowl game for the seventh straight year. These teams have been on different streaks as the year has progressed. UTSA has won seven of its last eight games, while Marshall has lost six of its last eight. Here are the live odds, team betting news, player props and our betting prediction for UTSA vs. Marshall in Tuesday's Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl.

More: North Carolina vs. West Virginia odds in Duke's Mayo Bowl | Best college football betting promos UTSA Roadrunners betting news UTSA has hit its stride over the second half of the season, before losing 29-16 to Tulane in its last outing. The Roadrunners scored at least 34 points in every win since Oct. 7, proving to be an offensive juggernaut. Everything starts with star QB Frank Harris. The dual-threat QB has completed 64.9% of his passes this season for 2,506 yards and 18 touchdowns. While impressive, he totaled 4,059 yards and 32 TDs on a 69.6% completion rate last year. UTSA's offense is good, but we've seen a better version of the unit in recent seasons. Still, Harris' experience and talent often shine through. UTSA's leading receiver Joshua Cephus did the heavy lifting for the unit. He caught 82 passes for 1,049 yards and nine touchdowns. The offense also had four ball carriers with at least 323 rushing yards, so there are plenty of threats for head coach Jeff Traylor to unleash. UTSA averaged 31.7 points and 424.6 total yards per game, which rank 37th and 39th in the nation, respectively. Roadrunners opponents ranked 69th in third down conversion rate, but the defense allowed an 87.5% score rate in the red zone (99th). UTSA is 5-6-1 ATS and 4-7-1 to the OVER. UTSA Roadrunners opting out of Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl The Roadrunners will be without their best defensive player, Trey Moore, as he looks to jump to a Power 5 school. Moore led the conference in sacks, so he's a star-level absence for the unit. Here are USTA players who won't play in the Frisco Bowl. Trey Moore, EDGE (transfer portal) Syrus Dumas, DB (transfer portal) Xavier Spencer, CB (transfer portal) Kyle Eaves, WR (transfer portal) Marshall Thundering Herd betting news The toughest blow for Marshall in this game is being without second-year starting QB Cam Fancher (transfer portal). Instead, Marshall will start freshman Cole Pennington, who is the son of former Marshall star QB Chad Pennington. Pennington has thrown six interceptions and zero touchdowns on only 79 passing attempts this season. Marshall's offense will continue to run through star RB Rasheen Ali. The senior speedster carried the offense even when Fancher was under center, totaling 1,256 yards and 15 touchdowns on the season. This offense has struggled despite Ali's efforts, ranking 93rd in scoring and 89th in yards per game. On the season, Marshall is 4-8 ATS and 6-6 on the O/U board. The Herd won only three of their eight conference games on the season. Marshall Thundering Herd opting out of Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl While UTSA has the biggest individual loss for this game, the Herd's depth has taken a huge blow thanks to transfer portal entrants. Chase Harrison, QB (transfer portal) Brandon McElroy, DL (transfer portal) Caleb Coombs, WR (transfer portal) Zion Odoms, WR (transfer portal) Jayven Hall, LB (transfer portal) Cam Fancher, QB (transfer portal) Thomas Lane, DL (transfer portal) Chinazo Obobi, OT (transfer portal) Maurice Jones, RB (transfer portal) Sean Sallis, TE (transfer portal) Myles Bell, DB (transfer portal) Trent Holler, iOL (transfer portal) Joshua McTier, CB (transfer portal) Jabarrek Hopkins, DL (transfer portal) CK Obobi, OL (transfer portal) Sean Ellis, TE (transfer portal) TyShawn Hurst, OT (transfer portal) Elijah Russell, EDGE (transfer portal) UTSA vs. Marshall prop bets at BetMGM Sportsbook BetMGM Sportsbook offers some excellent player props for the Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl between the Roadrunners and Thundering Herd.

The Roadrunners push the pace in a way that Marshall can't replicate, and the Thundering Herd aren't efficient enough to make the most of what few scoring opportunities they'll have. The Thundering Herd could find themselves down several scores by the end of the first frame if Pennington turns the ball over, as he's prone to do. UTSA is a well-oiled machine against teams with similar or worse talent, and Marshall is in that latter category. It's a big number to lay, but we're on the favorite Tuesday night. Pick: UTSA\n\nUTSA vs. Marshall odds, props, predictions: Roadrunners lay big spread in Frisco Bowl\n\nhttps://www.sportingnews.com/us/betting/news/utsa-vs-marshall-odds-props-predictions-spread-frisco-bowl/9f87d66235664608e5d678ba\n\nSporting News\n\nsports\n\nRob Miech\n\n2023-11-07T21:01:59+00:00\n\nThe Ponies are riding high again, having guaranteed their fifth consecutive winning season. Such success hasn‚Äôt been seen in Dallas since the years that led to SMU‚Äôs ignominious Death Penalty, which suspended its program in 1987 and ‚Äô88. SMU is 7-2, 5-0 in its final go-round in the American Athletic Conference. And here comes North Texas (3-6, 1-4), which has dropped four of its past five games and allows 37.4 points to its foes, ninth-worst in the nation. The Mustangs get a national ESPN2 audience Friday in a 9 p.m. ET kickoff. When looking at North Texas vs. SMU odds, props and predictions, the recent past gives us a pretty good window into what to expect: Over the previous four seasons, SMU has clamped down on North Texas by scores of 48-10, 35-12, 65-35 and 49-27, covering the spread each time and comfortably in all but one. North Texas at SMU odds: Point spread, moneyline, total Here are the latest college football betting odds for the Mean Green vs. Mustangs: This opened Mustangs -14 and an exorbitant total of 71.5 in Vegas, which had shifted to 16 and 67.5, respectively, 24 hours later. Two of our three models have SMU winning by 22 and 18 points, so the spread grabs our attention. North Texas betting news: There‚Äôs no 'D' in Mean Green This will be a challenge for North Texas because SMU possesses a top-10 defense, allowing foes only 0.251 points per play; which only stiffens (to 0.185) when the Ponies play at home. The North Texas defense is 12th from the D-I basement, giving up 0.501 ppp; and an even looser 0.533 on the highway. SMU‚Äôs 20th-rated offense (0.483) sharpens to a ridiculous 0.662 at home‚Äîthe only squads more efficient in their own yards are USC (0.780), LSU (0.762), Oregon (0.712) and Washington (0.690). The definition of √©lite. Until he had two passes picked off last Saturday in a 38-20 defeat to UTSA, junior QB Chandler Jones had thrown 262 passes through seven games with 19 TDs and no interceptions. Jones, who started his career at Louisiana-Monroe, snatched the job from Stone Earle early in the season and hasn‚Äôt disappointed first-year coach Eric Morris. The Mean Green defense has been another story, since allowing 681 total yards to Cal in the opener. Its past three foes have rung up 1,460 total yards and 15 TDs. Its yield of 479 yards per game is the worst in the country. That sound you hear is SMU super sophomore QB Preston Stone licking his chops as he read that last sentence. More college football: Best college football betting sites | Top college football bonuses SMU betting news: Ponies on a stone-cold winning streak The Mustangs are knotted atop the AAC with fellow 5-0 squads Tulane and UTSA. They‚Äôve accumulated 1,685 total yards of offense in their past three games, including 91 first downs via passing, running or penalty, and 18 touchdowns. By happy coincidence, no doubt for second-year SMU boss Rhett Lashlee, the defense has flexed over that span, yielding just 668 total yards, 39 total first downs and a mere four TDs. When last seen at Gerald J. Ford Stadium, two weeks ago, rain might have kept fans away as only 20,800 filled the 32,000-capacity barn for SMU‚Äôs 69-10 homecoming belting of Tulsa. Stone, playing near where he was raised, threw touchdown strikes of 74, 62 and 17 yards. By halftime, it was 52-3, the most Division I points tallied in the first 30 minutes this year. The 6-foot-2 sophomore from Dallas has been heating up lately, perfect timing to continue improving SMU‚Äôs bowl prospects after a 2-2 start that included keen tests (and defeats) at Oklahoma and TCU. The Mustangs own a five-game winning streak, and in his past four games Stone has thrown 122 passes, 10 for touchdowns and none for interceptions. He‚Äôs also run it in twice. He threw for 300 yards against Prairie View A&M, and in this golden four-game stretch he‚Äôs accumulated 1,171 aerial yards. Receivers RJ Maryland and Jordan Hudson have five TD catches apiece, and Roderick Daniels Jr. has four. Three others have two. Jaylan Knighton (511 yards, four TDs) paces the ground game. However, Stone‚Äôs sterling development might have found a speed bump last week at Rice when he left early in the fourth quarter after getting hit hard. He zipped to the locker room and returned, minus his helmet. If concussion protocol restricts him from playing Friday, look for redshirt freshman Kevin Jennings to start for SMU. He‚Äôs thrown 42 career passes, with 33 completions, four TDs and no picks. Should Stone not play, we will call an audible and play Under this total. Monitor it closely and prepare to take action within an hour of kickoff. North Texas vs. SMU props Player props for North Texas vs. SMU have not been made available at top sportsbooks, but BetRivers is offering several game props. Among them are a pair of team combo specials, pairing first TD and the game's outcome: SMU to score first and win: Yes -165; No +123 North Texas to score first and win: Yes +950; No -5000 North Texas at SMU prediction ATS At home, the Mustangs average 0.3 giveaways per game, among the top seven teams in the country. On the road, North Texas coughs it up nearly twice a game, among the bottom third of D-I. Moreover, SMU is one of 14 programs that are the best-balanced squads in the country, passing and running between 49 and 51 percent of the time. Coaches pray for such balance. And the SMU defense, top 10 in key categories, will keep QB Jones and the Mean Green at bay.

Parting ways with the National League after 50 years of play, the team was looking forward to an American League move. Hoping that their fortunes would be reversed from regularly ranking near the bottom of divisional standings, the Stros applied every method they could think of to win. But they weren‚Äôt all above board. America‚Äôs Favorite Video Today Jim Crane had obtained club ownership on Nov. 17, 2011. That same year, he brought in Jeff Luhnow, former McKinsey & Company management consultant, as General Manager. In 2014, Crane brought in A.J. Hinch as the manager after the firing of Bo Porter. And there began the story of the rise and decline of one of baseball‚Äôs biggest controversies. The Story Behind the Cheating Scandal That Rocked the 2017 MLB Season ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Jeff Luhnow had always been more about the numbers than people. Wanting to take out the humanity factor from baseball, he was almost an outcast in the sport when Jim Crane hired him. But his radical approach had worked in St. Louis, giving them two championships in six years. Why not the Bayou City next? The Houston Astros had not seen a World Series title yet and hadn‚Äôt even made the playoffs since 2005. Apparently desperate for any measures, they resorted to cheating. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that Luhnow didn‚Äôt consider his methods to be dishonest. As it turned out, the Astros had stolen signs throughout the 2017 season and the beginning of 2018. But the hornet‚Äôs nest wasn‚Äôt broken open until next year, when The Athletic‚Äòs Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich reported on it. After that, all hell broke loose. What Is Sign Stealing and How Did the Astros Manage to Do It? Powers of observation are as strong a skill as pitching or hitting and they‚Äôre perfectly legal in baseball. A batter can sometimes figure out from a pitcher‚Äôs unconscious movements, or ‚Äòtells‚Äô, what kind of ball is coming their way. At any given moment, non-verbal signs are flying around between a dugout and the field as a way for the players to communicate with a manager or coach. But as long as it‚Äôs done without extra help, this sign stealing is, in fact, allowed. What Houston did was not. The Stros installed cameras in center field at Minute Maid Park to record the opposing team‚Äôs catcher and pitcher‚Äôs signs. Cameras in a ballpark are ideally for challenging calls, but what was one more purpose? The funny thing is, teams have tried to catch on to their rival team‚Äôs signs since competitive baseball became a thing. The communication between the catcher and the pitcher can be key to hitting. But the 21st century has an added advantage ‚Äì technology. Behind the scenes, players could see a live feed from the camera. Then-bench coach Alex Cora decided to get a screen installed in the dugout. Players or managers would watch the live feed on the television placed in the tunnel leading from the dugout to the clubhouse. The irony lay in the method they used to then really the information to whoever was up to bat on the plate. Having tried out different methods of shouting and calling, the Astros landed on, of all things, a trash can. Players would bang on them, often using bats, with different rhythms signifying different pitches. Of course, they couldn‚Äôt do it at each home game, nor did they try. But whatever sorcery Houston had been practicing that year, it did the trick. It worked like a charm, and the Astros had their first World Series trophy in a long history. How Did MLB React to It? What Punishment Did It Hand Down? Not well. No one likes being taken for a fool and what the Astros had done undermined everything the league stood for. Fair play was the holy grail, yet the team had tread on it heartlessly. Fans were livid, although they didn‚Äôt get to let out their frustration until 2021. MLB, for its part, tried to curb the situation as best as it could. In two months, the league investigated ‚Äú68 people, including 23 Astros players, and collect more than 76,000 emails,‚Äù according to The Athletic. Luhnow‚Äôs phone showed signs of deleted information. Jan. 13, 2020, was when MLB suspended the disgraced GM and the skipper for the 2020 season. Only for Jim Crane to fire both a few hours later. But for many, the solution was severely lacking. Why Were the Astros Allowed to Keep Their World Series Trophy? In the words of MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred, ‚ÄúOnce you go down that road of changing what happens on the field, I just don‚Äôt know how you decide where you stop.‚Äù While many thought taking away the World Series win, essentially nullifying 2017, was the best way to move forward, MLB thought otherwise. The Coomissioner‚Äôs Trophy was still legitimate in the eyes of, well, the Commissioner. ‚ÄúCheaters‚Äù Houston Astros Suddenly Gain Momentum as College Baseball Team Stirs Up Controversial Trash Can Past Along With Thousands By the time the controversy was uncovered, the Astros were well into establishing a streak of successful years. Manfred called the process of stripping the Fall Classic title ‚Äúdifficult and impractical.‚Äù Already unpopular among the masses, he made things worse for himself when he called the trophy a ‚Äúpiece of metal.‚Äù Although he apologized later, the team kept the championship victory. Why Were the Players Not Penalized? It was an arduous process, investigating an entire organization. While the players were undoubtedly the ones who had put the tactics into play, the Astros staff suffered the heaviest consequences. The ballplayers were instead granted full immunity in exchange for cooperating with the investigation. Indeed, who would refuse such an offer? Of course, not everyone had been comfortable with what the Astros were doing behind the scenes, like Mike Fiers. Of that original team, four are still in Houston ‚Äì Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman, Lance McCullers Jr., and Justin Verlander. What makes fans ponder their extreme methods is how genuinely skilled each is. Yet they participated, willingly or unwillingly, in the biggest baseball scandal in recent years. Is the Inquiry Still On? After the Jan. 13, 2020 declaration, not much came from Manfred. Other than suspending the front office, MLB fined the Astros $5 million, the maximum amount, and made them forfeit first and second-round draft picks. For better or for worse, the inquiry is over. How Did the MLB World See This Entire Case? Needless to say, cheating is never taken in a positive light. Players once accused of using PEDs face the consequences long after they have been retired. It‚Äôs only been six years since 2017, and the league is still angry. Back then, social media was a landmine that the Astros probably stayed away from. It was the trash cans that did them in ‚Äì the irony was too brilliant, or hilarious if one looks at it another way, to ignore. Boos and jabs at away games were the least of it. When the Astros went to play against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team they had defeated in the 2017 World Series, fans retaliated by throwing inflatable trash cans onto the field. Others brought tin trash can caps to bang on when the Astros played against their teams. The phrase ‚ÄúTake the trash out‚Äù took a life of its own. Facing Cheating Allegations, Tom Brady‚Äôs Successor Mockingly Asserts that He‚Äôs not a Houston Astros Fan ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad But it wasn‚Äôt just baseball fans who were furious, other sports also considered it a tragedy. Fair play is taken seriously; no one likes being cheated out of an award. Even NBA star LeBron James spoke out in criticism against Houston. Has MLB Taken Any Action to Stop It From Happening Again? Before the details of the scandal came out, MLB had handed out warnings here and there against sign stealing. After this fiasco, new restrictions in 2020 prevented the video replay from including the catcher‚Äôs signs. In 2022, PitchCom devices also debuted. They allow a pitcher to communicate with the catcher without signs and a few other players on the field can also wear it. But will these tactics help?

Everything to Know About a Dark Moment in MLB History\n\nhttps://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-how-did-the-houston-astros-cheat-in-twenty-seventeen-everything-to-know-about-a-dark-moment-in-mlb-history/\n\nEssentially Sports\n\nsports\n\nThe New York Times\n\n2023-10-08T21:56:00+00:00\n\nBy Chad Jennings, C. Trent Rosecrans and Stephen J. Nesbitt In one American League Wild Card Series, the whole thing turned on a play designed around crowd noise. It was too loud at Target Field, Twins shortstop Carlos Correa realized, for the third-base coach to warn Blue Jays baserunners about a developing pickoff play. The Twins used the noise to their advantage, picked off Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and secured a two-game sweep. Advertisement In the other AL Wild Card Series, empty seats were everywhere. The Rays are an excellent team that thrives on their underdog status ‚Äî low payroll, injured players, they always find a way ‚Äî but playing in front of two of the smallest postseason crowds in the past 100 years, the Rays were swept by a Rangers team that had nine fewer wins in the regular season. The indifference was deafening. Home-field advantage, it turns out, just isn‚Äôt the same from one ballpark to the next. ‚ÄúTo be honest with you, I think we have one of the best home-field advantages in baseball,‚Äù third baseman Alec Bohm said as the Phillies swept the Marlins to improve to 24-11 in postseason games at Citizens Bank Park. ‚ÄúPeople say it‚Äôs difficult to play here and things like that. I think going through that type of stuff and learning how to play here, that just makes this time of year that much better.‚Äù This time of year certainly brings out the best, and the postseason‚Äôs greatest moments tend to be punctuated by the crowds who witness and react in real time. After seeing the way crowds could respond ‚Äî or not ‚Äî to October baseball this week, The Athletic ranked the home-field environments of the eight remaining playoff teams, from the replaceable to the Phanatical. No. 8: Arizona Diamondbacks Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Diamondbacks Chase Field 1998 48,405 24,212 Memorable postseason moment: Game 7 of the 2001 World Series started with a pair of 20-game winners in Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling and ended with Hall of Famers on the mound: Mariano Rivera and Randy Johnson. In what is remembered as one of the greatest postseason games of all time, Luis Gonzalez blooped a bases-loaded single to score Jay Bell and deny the Yankees their fourth consecutive title. Our take: We‚Äôre sorry, D-Backs fans. It‚Äôs not you. It‚Äôs them. A tremendously impressive two-game sweep in Milwaukee carried the Diamondbacks into a division series showdown with, oh boy, the Dodgers. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt think Arizona can beat L.A. at home ‚Äî the Diamondbacks split six games against the Dodgers at Chase Field this season ‚Äî but it‚Äôs less than a seven-hour drive from Dodger Stadium to downtown Phoenix, and we‚Äôre concerned that all the quirks of that ballpark could be rendered meaningless if there‚Äôs a bunch of Dodgers blue in the crowd. Advertisement There‚Äôs a lot to like. The pool. The retractable roof. We love it. We hope you prove us wrong. Show up, go nuts, and leave a comment ‚Äî click to subscribe! ‚Äî telling us we don‚Äôt know a rattlesnake from a water moccasin. We deserve it. But if we had to go on the road for a playoff game, at least in this round, we‚Äôd choose your ballpark. Consider it a compliment! Or maybe we just like the dry heat. No. 7: Texas Rangers Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Rangers Globe Life Field 2020 40,300 31,272 Memorable postseason moment: There have been 16 postseason games in Globe Life Field history, but the Rangers have never appeared in a playoff game at their new-ish home. How did that happen? Well, 2020. It was a weird time. The Dodgers played in all 16 of those during the 2020 expanded playoffs, sweeping the Padres in the NLDS, going seven games with the Braves in the NLCS and then winning the World Series. Our take: This is the great unknown. Globe Life Field opened in a season that had no fans, and it remained open for losing seasons in 2021 and 2022. Saturday will be our first look at the place when the home team is actually playing meaningful baseball in October. Hard to rank it any higher until we know what we‚Äôre dealing with. Largest crowd ever for a game at Globe Life Field. #StraightUpTX pic.twitter.com/4I7NIB5eF8 ‚Äî Chris Halicke (@ChrisHalicke) May 1, 2022 The old Rangers ballpark could drum up a Texas-sized atmosphere worthy of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Pat Green, but the new place ‚Äî at least in the regular season ‚Äî feels very much like a multi-events space that happens to be hosting a ballgame. Maybe that changes in the playoffs? The Rangers haven‚Äôt been home since Sept. 24 when they won their last five games in Arlington, the last three of which went a long way toward keeping the Mariners out of the postseason. With a closed roof containing all the noise, Globe Life is sure to get awfully loud, and nothing turns a glorified convention center into a real ballpark quite like a late-inning rally in October. No. 6: Minnesota Twins Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Twins Target Field 2010 38,544 24,371 Memorable postseason moment: For this, you have to go all the way back to Tuesday. The Twins snapped an 18-game postseason losing streak with two blasts off the bat of rookie Royce Lewis. It was their first playoff win since Oct. 5, 2004. On Wednesday, they completed the Wild Card sweep of the Blue Jays for their first postseason series win since 2002. The roars heard at Target Field, like this one, were more than two decades in the making. One of those 10,000 Rakes definitely belongs to Royce Lewis. üí™ pic.twitter.com/3gRJp2i8eb ‚Äî MLB (@MLB) October 3, 2023 Our take: We have only a small sample of postseason games at Target Field, but, boy, Twins fans can make some noise. After Game 1 against Toronto, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said, ‚ÄúI thought the place was going to split open and melt, honestly. It was out of this universe out there on the field. The fans took over the game. They helped us win today.‚Äù The next day, they did it again. Advertisement Early in Game 2, Correa told Sonny Gray that, because of the crowd noise, Jays baserunners couldn‚Äôt hear their third-base coach screaming, ‚ÄúBACK!‚Äù So, with Guerrero on second and a full count to Bo Bichette, they executed a perfect timing pick. ‚ÄúThe crowd was incredible,‚Äù Gray said after the game. ‚ÄúThey were incredible yesterday. They were incredible today from the moment I stepped on the mound an hour before the game to the moment ‚Äî they‚Äôre probably still out there.‚Äù So, Twins fans have swarmed their team with support. But is it intimidating? (It‚Äôs certainly better than its predecessor, the Metrodome, but it doesn‚Äôt have the same potential for overwhelming volume.) For now, Target Field strikes us as more of an awesome place to play than one that strikes fear in the opponent. But this month Twins fans could prove us very wrong. No. 5: Houston Astros Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Astros Minute Maid Park 2000 41,168 37,683 Memorable postseason moment: Albert Pujols off Brad Lidge? Jorge Soler to the moon? Nah, we‚Äôll go with Chris Burke ending what was then the longest game in MLB postseason history in both time (5 hours, 50 minutes) and innings (18) with a walk-off home run with one out in the 18th inning in the 2005 NLDS. Burke didn‚Äôt start the game but pinch-ran for Lance Berkman in the 10th. Roger Clemens came into the game for Houston in the 16th and pitched three scoreless to pick up the win. But it is Burke‚Äôs homer that will always be remembered. Our take: We get it, Houston. We also think your ballpark should be in the top half of this list. One of our writers called it ‚Äúthe loudest stadium I‚Äôve ever attended, by at least one standard deviation.‚Äù The Astros sold out the building 23 times this year. They drew 3 million fans for the first time since 2007. Minute Maid Park is big and loud, and visiting fans show up fully exhausted from walking in the south Texas sun. The final out from the crowd‚Äôs point of view. Wow. Congrats Astros!!! World Series champs again!! #fortheH pic.twitter.com/HKnal8fcuB ‚Äî Sally MacDonald (@SallyMacFox26) November 6, 2022 But in all those sellouts, the Astros went 6-17. Despite all that noise, they were 39-42 at home. Before their final homestand, the team added some green paint to the batter‚Äôs eye in response to player complaints, and the Astros responded by going 1-5 with three of those losses coming against the Royals. So, yes, the ballpark is packed tighter than toes in a cowboy boot, and the place gets louder than a Pantera concert in a concrete basement, but these Astros just haven‚Äôt responded to it. Why not? Should a visiting team really be all that intimidated by it? Bring back the in-play flagpole atop Tal‚Äôs Hill, we say! No. 4: Atlanta Braves Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Braves Truist Park 2017 41,084 39,401 Memorable postseason moment: When the Braves won the World Series in 1914, they were still playing in Boston. In 1957, Milwaukee. When Sid Bream slid home to beat the Pirates in 1992, the Braves were in the right city but at the wrong ballpark (Fulton County Stadium doesn‚Äôt count). The Max Fried-Jorge Soler game in 2021 happened in Houston. The iconic moment at Truist Park could be Eddie Rosario‚Äôs dazzling catch at the wall in Game 4 of the 2021 World Series, but the most memorable ‚Äî even though it didn‚Äôt lead to a championship ‚Äî might be rookie Ronald Acuna Jr. hitting a grand slam off Walker Buhler in Game 3 of the 2018 NLDS, which happened to be the first postseason game ever played at the ballpark. Our take: Obviously, there are issues bigger than baseball to deal with here. The war chant and Tomahawk Chop are offensive and problematic, but we‚Äôre not going to resolve that issue in the next four weeks. In fact, it‚Äôs all about to come front and center ‚Äî again ‚Äî as the best team in baseball opens its postseason with a roster that would be plenty intimidating in a Little League park with metal bleachers. Advertisement But have you ever seen them play in front of 40,000 screaming fans when the stadium lights go dark and the entire ballpark starts doing the Chop in unison with their lit cell phones? ‚ÄúIt does add something to the offensive ambiance,‚Äù our Braves scribe David O‚ÄôBrien noted. Truist Park had 54 sellouts this season, and the place drew just over 3.19 million, which was the Braves‚Äô highest total attendance since the park formerly known as SunTrust opened in 2017. The Braves have won six straight division titles, and they‚Äôve been to the playoffs 22 times since 1991. This is not uncharted territory for them. This ballpark is going to be packed with fans who know their team is good and will not be quiet about it, regardless of what anyone else thinks. No. 3: Baltimore Orioles Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Orioles Oriole Park at Camden Yards 1992 44,970 23,911 Memorable postseason moment: Delmon Young‚Äôs three-run double in the eighth inning of Game 2 of the 2014 ALDS completed the Orioles‚Äô comeback from three runs down in the eighth to beat the Tigers. Zack Britton pitched a perfect ninth, and the Orioles would go on to beat the Tigers in Game 3 in Detroit to sweep the series before losing to the Royals in the ALCS. Our take: When the Orioles are bad, their ballpark is bad. Beautiful and unmistakable, but bad because of the empty seats and because it is basically a second home ballpark for every East Coast team that takes the train into Baltimore and overwhelms the place with their own variation of the ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, Yankees‚Äù chant. It‚Äôs a ballpark that can be, and has been, taken over by opposing fans. When the Orioles are good, though, Camden Yards is one of the best ballparks in the country, and it starts pregame with every rendition of the national anthem that includes the entire ballpark screaming ‚ÄúO!‚Äù in unison, so loud that it drowns out the word ‚Äúsay‚Äù before the hope-they‚Äôre-ready-for-it singer gets to the words, ‚Äúdoes that star-spangled banner yet wave.‚Äù The final night game of the 2023 regular season at Camden Yards pic.twitter.com/ALgqhoJVp6 ‚Äî Andy Kostka (@afkostka) September 30, 2023 As you‚Äôve no doubt realized, the Orioles are awfully good this year, and we expect Camden Yards to follow their lead. The O‚Äôs had the second-most wins in baseball, and their fans responded with a home attendance that jumped more than a half million from last season. A young Orioles roster might be at risk of being shell-shocked on the road, but at home, this team is going to be treated as heroes from the start. \"Go crazy, Baltimore. You are the champions of the American League East.\" Kevin Brown on the call as the Orioles clinch the American League East and the No. 1 seed in the American League. pic.twitter.com/Q2eXPe4uYL ‚Äî Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) September 29, 2023 Let‚Äôs just hope, when they go on the road, manager Brandon Hyde doesn‚Äôt forget to use his best reliever in a must-win game. That could be pretty bad. No. 2: Los Angeles Dodgers Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Dodgers Dodger Stadium 1962 56,000 47,371 Memorable postseason moment: With two outs and a runner on in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, Kirk Gibson hobbled toward home plate and stepped in against Hall of Fame A‚Äôs closer Dennis Eckersley. The Dodgers were down one and down to their last out. Gibson had an injured left hamstring and a balky right knee. He fouled off Eckersley‚Äôs first offering and almost fell over. He fouled off a couple more and worked the count full. Then he pulled an outside pitch into the right-field seats for a walk-off homer and, somehow, made his way around the bases. It remains one of the most badass moments in World Series history. Our take: All the jokes about traffic still making its way into the parking lot in the second inning are justified. The ‚Äúintensity‚Äù of baseball in L.A. isn‚Äôt the same as it is in, say, St. Louis or Boston or any other city where athletes are the biggest celebrities in town. Advertisement But by the middle innings, Dodger Stadium is packed, and by the late innings of playoff games, the place has the over-the-top intensity of a Michael Bay car chase (Mookie Betts as Bumblebee). More than one opposing pitcher this season had to tweak his PitchCom device to deal with the late-inning noise that came from such a massive ballpark, one that once again held the largest total attendance in baseball this year. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a four-deck stadium,‚Äù Freddie Freeman said this summer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only one in baseball. You‚Äôve got 50,000 people, every single night here. For them to go out of their way to make you feel good when you‚Äôre doing your job, it means a lot. I do appreciate it. It does make you feel good inside and also just means you‚Äôre doing your job pretty good.‚Äù Speaking of doing a job pretty good, the Dodger Stadium D.J. is a maniac. For starters, the volume is set at a level that can‚Äôt possibly meet OSHA standards, and beyond that, there‚Äôs some twisted desire to have some sort of noise blaring at all times. Plus, there‚Äôs the intimidation factor of playing in an iconic ballpark that feels like no other in baseball. Dodger Stadium knows what it is and what it‚Äôs about, and it uses every bit of that to its advantage. No. 1: Philadelphia Phillies Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Phillies Citizens Bank Park 2004 42,792 38,157 Memorable postseason moment: There have been three no-hitters in postseason history, and two have taken place at Citizens Bank Park. Those in Philly would like to forget the Astros‚Äô combined no-hitter in Game 4 of last season‚Äôs World Series, so instead we‚Äôll concentrate on Roy Halladay‚Äôs 2010 no-hitter in Game 1 of the NLDS against the Reds. In his first postseason start, Halladay allowed only one baserunner, when Jay Bruce walked with two outs in the fifth inning. Our take: Look, Philadelphia fans have thrown snowballs at Santa Claus and batteries at J.D. Drew. Their Phanatic mascot is iconic, but part of his charm is the way he ‚Äì it? ‚Äì taunts and antagonizes opponents. It‚Äôs a real love-it or hate-it place to play. The Phillies and their fans are capable of producing unforgettable moments, like Wednesday night when Bryson Stott hit a grand slam and the ballpark provided the only commentary necessary. stott grand slam w/ no commentators thx to ESPN's dolby 5.1 mix pic.twitter.com/2vhUzWKpup ‚Äî jaiden (@steph_turkey) October 5, 2023 ‚ÄúI yelled at the dugout and couldn‚Äôt really hear myself,‚Äù Stott said, ‚Äúso I knew the crowd was loud. Any time we get to play here, you know it‚Äôs going to be loud from the very first pitch. I wouldn‚Äôt want to play anywhere else. It‚Äôs a phenomenal time every time we take the field here in the postseason.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always said it, we‚Äôve got the best fans in baseball,‚Äù Bryce Harper added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an amazing place to play.‚Äù (Top photo of Game 2 of the Wild Card series between the Marlins and the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park on Wednesday: Rob Tringali / MLB Photos via Getty Images)\n\nWhich M.L.B.

Here‚Äôs our latest coverage as the case nears its end. The trial of Bankman-Fried, the former CEO and co-founder of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, is entering its next chapter as proceedings resume Thursday. As confirmed during a teleconference Wednesday, SBF will be taking the stand, along with a handful of other witnesses as the onus shifts toward the defense after the prosecution brought its case to its conclusion. As former federal prosecutor Josh Naftalis told TechCrunch, SBF taking to the stand in his own trial is a ‚ÄúHail Mary‚Äù ahead of a verdict and potential sentencing for seven counts tied to fraud and money laundering. ‚ÄúOnce it goes to cross[-examination], he doesn‚Äôt get to say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm done,‚Äô‚Äù Naftalis said. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt just walk out if he doesn‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs going.‚Äù Naftalis spoke at length about what comes next in the trial, and addressed common misconceptions about the prosecution and defense in the latest episode of TechCrunch‚Äôs Chain Reaction podcast, which you can listen to below, or on Apple Podcasts or Spotify. The SBF trial is one of the biggest cases of its kind within the crypto space. Our resident crypto expert Jacquelyn Melinek has been on the ground at the trial since it started, and continues to cover the ins and outs of the proceedings. But the trial has been on pause from October 20 to today, so there‚Äôs plenty to catch up on if you need a refresher ahead of it entering its final few phases. For those in need of a total refresher on the case, her breakdown of how FTX went from the third-largest crypto exchange valued at a peak of $32 billion to bankruptcy will get you up to speed. You can also follow along with her and the TechCrunch team‚Äôs coverage in the Chain Reaction newsletter, which drops Thursdays at 12 p.m. PT, and the Chain Reaction podcast, which will hit your feed every Thursday. How to follow the SBF trial The trial kicked off with jury selection October 3. From there, access to the proceedings is limited, as no devices are allowed; reports are being physically put together within the courtroom (or sent to overflow rooms). Beyond our daily coverage, additional expertise and commentary will live on TechCrunch+. There, you can find stories like this in-depth breakdown of what to expect from both sides of the SBF case, where the prosecution and defense could gain ground or fall short in their arguments and what the takeaways were from the opening arguments. SBF trial: What we learned in week three The third week of the trial featured a couple of noteworthy moments for the prosecution, including FTX‚Äôs former general counsel Can Sun. He, like many of SBF‚Äôs former colleagues, opted to cooperate with authorities and testified that SBF asked him to create a theoretical ‚Äúlegal justification‚Äù for the use of billions in consumer funds just days before FTX filed for bankruptcy. Robert Boroujerdi, managing director of the hedge fund Third Point, testified about his experience working with SBF and FTX, in a partnership that ultimately resulted in a $60 million investment and a lack of awareness about the special relationship between Alameda Research and FTX. Had he known of such a relationship, he testified that Third Point would not have invested in FTX in the first place. And earlier in the week, a University of Notre Dame professor who helped the government prosecution of Enron and WorldCom, Peter Easton, testified about what he uncovered after tracing the flow of billions of dollars between Alameda Research and FTX. Much of said funding came from customers, and Easton testified that he found that user deposits were used by both FTX and Alameda to purchase real estate, make investments or direct funding toward political causes and charities. SBF trial: What we learned in week two The second week of the trial‚Äôs standout testimony came from Alameda Research‚Äôs former CEO Caroline Ellison, who claimed she took $14 billion from customers to repay debts to lenders, using them as a line of credit under the instruction of SBF. Ellison also went into detail about how a $2 billion venture fund, FTX Ventures, was funded by money that had previously been allocated to Alameda from third-party lenders. And though there are no charges of bribery in the case, Ellison also testified to paying Chinese officials $150 million to restore access to $1 billion in frozen trading accounts. SBF trial: What we learned in the week one As expected, the opening statements in the SBF trial were spicy. The prosecution painted a picture of an empire ‚Äúbuilt on lies‚Äù and made a point to show actual pictures of SBF alongside rich and powerful figures to illustrate the peak of his power and influence prior to FTX‚Äôs implosion. ‚ÄúThis man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people,‚Äù prosecutor Thane Rehn told the court. ‚ÄúHe defrauded sophisticated investors and lenders, and he emptied the accounts of ordinary customers, too. He bought himself wealth, power and influence.‚Äù The defense, on the other hand, depicted SBF and his colleagues as in over their heads, without ill-will as FTX collapsed around them. ‚ÄúSam and his colleagues were building the plane as they were flying it,‚Äù defense attorney Mark Cohen said. ‚ÄúThey had to figure out how to navigate a world where they were running FTX, building out its systems, dealing with hacking threats, managing the credit risk of their customers, managing hundreds of employees, all while building up their actual exchange.‚Äù Read a recap of the prosecution and defense‚Äôs full arguments here. FTX‚Äôs co-founder and CTO Gary Wang testified Thursday on the extent to which Alameda Research was used for whatever purposes he and SBF saw fit. The crypto trading firm, according to Wang, pulled funding directly from FTX customers, whose transactions would be funneled toward Alameda and then directed elsewhere. Check here for our rundown of Wang‚Äôs testimony so far, resulting from a guilty plea in December 2022. Thursday also brought in testimony from Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner at crypto investment firm Paradigm. That firm invested $278 million in FTX across 2021 and 2022, and is part of a class-action lawsuit accusing it and others of defrauding customers by promoting FTX. His testimony centered around being left uninformed about FTX‚Äôs utilization of customer money to keep the Alameda Research afloat, a practice that Huang says would have halted his involvement. The full breakdown of his testimony on his relationship with FTX, stretching back to 2019, can be found right here. We also got a look at the composition of the SBF trial‚Äôs jury, which ranges from a train conductor to a retired investment banker who attended Stanford University. You can listen to a special joint episode of our podcasts Equity and Chain Reaction to get a better sense of the vibe between the jurors and the rest of the court.

And as one former federal prosecutor put it: ‚ÄúThe odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.‚Äù The 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange‚Äôs valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It‚Äôs now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors. But how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here? Before FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm. Within two years, more than 80 investors provided about $2 billion in capital to FTX, helping Bankman-Fried propel his vision into a reality. In January 2022, the company raised $400 million in a Series C round, boosting its valuation to $32 billion. That was its last round of public funding. The company gained somewhat mainstream recognition with branding deals and partnerships. For example, in 2021 it bought the naming rights for the Miami Heat‚Äôs home arena. FTX also got its name branded on Major League Baseball umpires‚Äô polos, and it partnered with celebrities like Tom Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele B√ºndchen, as well as Steph Curry, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal and Naomi Osaka, among others. He also had close ties to U.S. regulators and government officials, many of whom he donated to. Bankman-Fried was even compared to Warren Buffet and many called him the white horse of crypto (TechCrunch never did, for what it‚Äôs worth). But in early November 2022, that all changed. FTX‚Äôs collapse Concerns surrounding FTX‚Äôs liquidity grew after CoinDesk published a copy of Alameda‚Äôs balance sheet, showing the firm held $14.6 billion in assets and $8 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2022. But there was a problem: The report showed Alameda‚Äôs largest asset was $3.66 billion of ‚Äúunlocked FTT‚Äù and $2.16 billion of ‚ÄúFTT collateral.‚Äù FTT was the token behind FTX. The balance sheet showed that the $5.82 billion in FTT tokens that Alameda owned was 193% higher than the total FTT market cap, which was about $3 billion at the time. That means it purported to have more FTT tokens on its balance sheet than what existed in the world. Around the same time it was exposed, the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance, started pulling out its remaining $2.1 billion equivalent of cash in BUSD and FTT. (It had an equity position in FTX from 2019 to 2021.) This essentially triggered a bank run on FTX. FTX and Alameda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. mid-November 2022. Bankman-Fried resigned, and John J. Ray III, the Enron turnaround veteran, was appointed its new CEO. Bankman-Fried, however, maintained his innocence. At The New York Times‚Äô DealBook Summit, he appeared virtually from the Bahamas, saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ever try to commit fraud on anyone; I was shocked by what happened this month.‚Äù In a published DM exchange with a Vox reporter, he said he regretted filing for bankruptcy and thought that ‚Äúregulators make everything worse.‚Äù SBF arrested Bankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 in the Bahamas, where FTX was based. He was then extradited to the U.S. to face a number of criminal charges. He was released on a $250 million bail bond, and he remained under house arrest at his parents‚Äô home in Palo Alto. This was revoked in August after he was accused of intimidating Alameda‚Äôs former CEO, Caroline Ellison, by leaking her private diary. Ray represented the company during a House Financial Services Committee hearing regarding FTX. When asked whether the firm had significant risk management systems, Ray said at the time that ‚Äúthere were virtually no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever‚Äù and added that he did not ‚Äútrust a single piece of paper‚Äù in the exchange‚Äôs organization. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Bankman-Fried‚Äôs alleged crimes ‚Äúone of the biggest financial frauds in American history,‚Äù in a press conference. The aftermath FTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang, and Alameda Research‚Äôs former CEO, Caroline Ellison, both pleaded guilty in December 2022 to federal criminal charges in relation to the FTX collapse. They‚Äôre also facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda. In January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges. The crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX‚Äôs collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January. Where we are today Bankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney. If that name sounds familiar, it might be because he also represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial related to Jeffrey Epstein. He requested an early release for Bankman-Fried but was denied. With the trial beginning, we‚Äôre witnessing how FTX‚Äôs story ends. But what‚Äôs on our mind is what happens to the investors and creditors affected by the collapse? And what happens to the billions in crypto assets tied up in legal proceedings?\n\nSBF‚Äôs trial starts soon, but how did he ‚Äî and FTX ‚Äî get here?\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2023/10/01/ftx-lawsuit-timeline/\n\nTechCrunch\n\ntechnology\n\nKyle Wiggers\n\n2023-10-07T20:15:26+00:00\n\nHiya, folks, and welcome to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch‚Äôs digest of the past week in tech news. It‚Äôs TC‚Äôs column that highlights the major stories over the past few days, and ‚Äî we humbly submit ‚Äî it‚Äôs a darn useful resource for folks on the go. This week, we cover Sam Altman backing a teen‚Äôs AI startup, Google‚Äôs hardware event (and first impressions of the Pixel 8 Pro), Flexport drama, and the ongoing FTX fallout. Also on the agenda: Gmail‚Äôs harsher rules to prevent spam, TikTok testing an ad-free subscription plan, and LinkedIn going big on AI tools. And that‚Äôs not all. If you haven‚Äôt, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. And if you have, our thanks. Now, let‚Äôs get on with the news. Most read Altman backs teen entrepreneurs: Sam Altman is among the backers of an AI startup, founded by two teenagers, that‚Äôs aiming to assist businesses in automating workflows in ‚Äúpreviously unexplored‚Äù ways. Manish writes that Induced AI, founded this year, lets businesses input their back-office tasks in plain English and converts the instructions to pseudo-code in real time. Google unveils new hardware: This week was Google‚Äôs annual hardware event, where the search and consumer tech giant showed off what it‚Äôs been working on. Christine wrote up a thorough roundup of the news, which included updates on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, Android 14, Pixel Buds, Google Assistant, Bard, Pixel Watch 2 and other goodies. Hands on with the Pixel 8 Pro: Darrell took the newly unveiled Pixel 8 Pro for a whirl, and he liked what he saw. While very similar to last year‚Äôs model (the Pixel 7 Pro), Darrell felt that the improved cameras, brighter screen and enhanced AI-powered features made it enough of an upgrade to (potentially) warrant a purchase ‚Äî minus the underutilized temperature sensor. Stay tuned for his full review. Turmoil at Flexport: Dave Clark, the former Amazon executive who was ousted as CEO of Flexport just a year into the job, fired back at its founder and board, calling recent reporting on the logistics company ‚Äúdeeply concerning.‚Äù Clark made the comments Monday in a lengthy post on social media site X following a report from CNBC that provided new information about his last days at Flexport, a freight forwarding and customs brokerage startup valued at $8 billion. SBF allegedly tried to buy off Trump: The TC team‚Äôs been trained on the Manhattan Federal Court for the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced entrepreneur accused of orchestrating the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. But fascinating details about SBF‚Äôs political dealings are emerging from a book by Michael Lewis, ‚ÄúGoing Infinite,‚Äù that debuted on the first day of the trial, like SBF‚Äôs attempt to buy off Trump to get him to not run again for president. Gmail fights back against spammers: Google this week announced a series of significant changes to how it handles email from bulk senders in an effort to cut down on spam and other unwanted emails. The company says that, starting next year, bulk senders will need to authenticate their emails, offer an easy way to unsubscribe and stay under a reported spam threshold. TikTok tests an ad-free tier: TikTok is testing an ad-free subscription tier for some users. For $4.99, subscribers get an ad-free experience on TikTok ‚Äî no other strings attached. But don‚Äôt look for the option to arrive anytime soon. TikTok says that it‚Äôs piloting the plan in a single, English-speaking market outside the U.S. for now. LinkedIn leans into AI tools: LinkedIn this week unveiled a string of new AI features spanning its job hunting, marketing and sales products, Ingrid writes. They include a big update to its Recruiter talent sourcing platform, with AI assistance built into it throughout; an AI-powered LinkedIn Learning coach; and a new AI-powered tool for marketing campaigns. Musk comes clean about X‚Äôs metrics ‚Äî maybe: In September, Elon Musk said that X users were generating a lot of content ‚Äî creating 100 million to 200 million posts every day, excluding retweets. But speaking at an event this week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino offered a contradictory figure. She claimed X was seeing 500 million posts per day on the platform. So who‚Äôs right? Beats us. Former NSA director‚Äôs startup shutters: IronNet, a once-promising cybersecurity startup founded by a former NSA director, has shuttered and laid off its remaining staff following its collapse. The Virginia-based IronNet was founded in 2014 by retired four-star general Keith Alexander and had raised more than $400 million in funding. But IronNet fail"
