        "text": "I get it. 👉 I understand that you have been in the job market for a while. 👉 I understand that you are stressed out on how you're going to make ends meet. 👉 I understand that you are tired of applying to jobs just to get rejected. 👉 I understand that when a recruiter calls about an opportunity and salary doesn't fit my needs. I once was there too. But one thing I never did was burn a bridge with a recruiter. Because I knew that with this competitive job market, I couldn't afford it.\n\nNew Title: Professional Recruiter 🎉 About 3 months ago, I made the switch from Sales back to recruiting. Why? Because I missed speaking to you, the candidates. I remember I was in the candidates shoes not too long ago thrown into the job market we’re in currently and I was afraid of what was next to come. If I can have the opportunity to hear your stories as a candidate, to make a positive impact somehow in your job search, and be that little piece of hope…then there is no other place I would rather be than to be in the recruiter chair. I get so many messages from candidates asking for help in their job search. And though I unfortunately can’t reach all of you due to the flooding of messages I receive each day, I hope my posts reach you and assure you that you’re heard and to remind you not to give up in your job search. Your time is coming! Cheers to a new chapter! ❤️ #Promotion #Recruiter #JobSeekers\n\nI took a cut in my pay and I had an even better outcome than I expected. 😶 In December of 2022 I was laid off unexpectedly while I was pregnant. I applied to hundreds of jobs for 8 months until August of 2023 when I was offered my position as a recruiter. It wasn't necessarily the career path I envisioned for myself, and the pay was certainly lower than my last role. My intuition said \"yes, take it. The culture is what you always wanted in a company.\" But the other part of me was saying \"you are worth more.\" I took a day to think about it and I went for it. Fast forward, almost a year later, it was the best decision I ever made. This is the first time I feel like my voice is being heard, where I actually feel like I am making a difference in others lives, and I don't drag my feet coming into work. Hearing candidates cry out of excitement that they got the job, hearing people's stories and being able to relate to them, hearing other mom's stories being laid off after maternity leave... I realized this was what I was meant to do. I am where I am supposed to be. 💫 Moral of the story: Listen to your gut. If it feels right, go for it. It's meant for you.\n\nHappy Pride Month 🌈 As the diversity council ambassador for our Las Vegas office at Insight Global, my goal is to make sure that current and future employees feel comfortable to come as they are. ✨ For the month of June, I decided to host our first ever book club (which was a success btw!)📚🤓 where we recognize an author who identifies part of the LGBTQ+ community. Glennon Doyle’s “Untamed” was our office choice in recognition of Pride Month. So far, this book has opened our eyes, allowed us to do some self reflection of our own lives, and remind ourselves that we all have internal battles we’re fighting. I love being apart of a company and an office who is inclusive and encourages people to #comeasyouare\n\nBeing a parent or having a child is not a burden. I came across a video of a woman who was afraid to tell her manager's she was pregnant. Her story reminded me of myself. 💥 Her result: Her manager and Director were happy for her and assured her that her role was safe. They even said \"oh thank goodness. We thought you were leaving us for good!\" 💥 My result: I was laid-off two week after notifying HR. 💥 The difference: Management saw her as a human being, whereas I was looked at as a number. Lesson learned: if you plan to grow your family, choose your employer wisely. Employers, normalize employees having a life outside of work and not punishing them for it. New life and parenthood should be a moment of celebration. Because at least from my experience, you best believe that employee will work EVEN HARDER because they have an EVEN BIGGER purpose. #career #maternityleave #paternityleave\n\n✨ 8 months later as a recruiter... I am officially now an Account Manager in Training at Insight Global ✨ In these past 2 weeks I have accomplished: - 10 meetings off (25% to goal) - Building relationships with new clients helping fill their urgent hiring needs - Sourcing through candidate resumes to fill clients reqs The world of recruiting has allowed me to help candidates find their next opportunity but also show my compassion for others. Now, I have the chance to help clients with hiring needs AND help candidates find their dream role??!! Absolutely exciting! 🤩 #recruiting #promotion #accountmanager\n\nRemember to thank your recruiter too. Because behind closed doors, we were going to battle for you. ⭐ Without the recruiter , your resume is just a piece of paper to a hiring manager. We are your voice. 🗣 ⭐ Maybe you may not hit all the requirements, but we sure will try to sell you in to the hiring manager as to why you would be a great fit. 💪 ⭐ A recruiter wants you to land that job just as much as you want that job. So the next time you pass along a 'thank you' note, remember to send one to your recruiter too. 🗒 That note can go a long way. Perhaps enough to always keep you in mind for future opportunities. 💼\n\n“Interviews are like speed dating. You have 30+ min to get to know one another and see if it’s a good fit on both ends” I’ll never forget these words by one of my candidates and it made me chuckle but yet it’s so true! So this is a friendly reminder to hiring managers: ✅ Candidates are interviewing you too. First impressions are huge! ✅ Candidates will naturally be nervous. So small talk allows for you to get to know one another and helps the candidate loosen up their nerves. A silly little comment that stuck with me forever and thought it was worth sharing with you too! #interviewingtips #interview #hiringmanager"
