        "text": "Heath, Lorraine. The Duchess in His Bed. New York: Avon, 2019.\n\nISBN-13: 978-0062676061 | $7.99 USD | 387 pages | Victorian Romance\n\nBlurb\n\nFor a duchess with practical desires, falling in love is an inconceivable part of her plan…\n\nAs owner of the Elysium Club which caters to women’s fantasies, Aiden Trewlove is accustomed to introducing adventurous ladies to sin and vice. But he is uncharacteristically intrigued by the mysterious beauty who visits his club one night, yearning to indulge in the forbidden—with him. Drawn to her indomitable spirit, he breaks his rule of never becoming personally involved with his clientele and is determined to fully awaken her desires.\n\nA recent widow, Selena Sheffield, Duchess of Lushing, has never known passion, not until Aiden’s slow, sensual seduction leads her on a journey of discovery and incredible pleasure. But her reasons for visiting the notorious club are not all that they seem.\n\nAs Selena’s motives become complicated by love, she finds herself with a most unexpected choice: forge ahead with a secret plan that could secure her future—or follow her heart which could prove ruinous.\n\nIn the series\n\n#1 Beyond Scandal and Desire\n\n#2 When a Duke Loves a Woman\n\n#3 The Scoundrel in Her Bed\n\nReview\n\n5 stars\n\nDespite a rocky start, Lorraine Heath’s Sins for All Seasons has gotten better and better with each book. The Duchess in His Bed is the best of the series yet. Once again, she tackles a challenging storyline with deep subject matter with grace and empathy for her major characters.\n\nWith Selena’s character, I love how the narrative explored a concept that isn’t often touched on in historicals, but was a grim reality for many noble families at one point or another: the noble line dying out. Heath parses out the legalese fairly simply, and makes a compelling case for Selena to try to deceive the world by quickly conceiving a child with someone else to keep the title and properties in her family. I loved seeing how deeply she cared for her brother and sisters, and how much the burden of having to be the responsible eldest weighed on her, but I also like that she did try to prepare her brother to take on more responsibilities later in the book too, so she wasn’t going it alone.\n\nAiden is perhaps my favorite of the Trewloves, although all the siblings are delightful in their own way. As previously hinted at in the prior book, he has a bit more baggage than Finn about their father, and I appreciated the way this was handled. Aiden, like Mick, does crave acceptance to some degree, but he’s also fairly happy being a Trewlove, and he is grateful to Ettie for raising him, and acknowledges the sacrifices she made for all of them.\n\nThe romance between the two was beautiful, if complicated because of their contrasting desires in life. Aiden initially doesn’t even want to father children, because of his background. While the situation could have been a bit touchy, with the power dynamics between them as well, I appreciate that she did let him in on what was going on, giving him the option to participate, and even be involved in the child’s life. I savored every moment of them together, navigating this situation, and I deeply rooted for them to figure out a way to be together.\n\nBut what truly tipped the scales for me, raising this from a solid book to an excellent book was the way the paternity arc with Finn and Aiden’s father, the Earl of Elverton was resolved. While I still don’t forgive Heath for her poor handling of this in book 1 (and bringing it up in every book is not helping matters), the earl being a rotten human being and finally getting his comeuppance satisfied me in indescribable ways. The related reveal of Aiden’s (but not Finn’s) mother was also much more bittersweet, and tied to the ongoing theme in this series of women’s mistreatment by men in power and those same men using baby farms as a means to get rid of their illegitimate children.\n\nI really loved this one, and I’d recommend it to readers looking for an emotionally moving historical romance.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nLorraine Heath always dreamed of being a writer. After graduating from the University of Texas, she wrote training manuals, press releases, articles, and computer code, but something was always missing. When she read a romance novel, she not only became hooked on the genre, but quickly realized what her writing lacked: rebels, scoundrels, and rogues. She’s been writing about them ever since. Her novels have been recognized with numerous industry awards and have appeared on the USA Today and New York Times bestseller lists.\n\nWebsite\n\nBuy links\n\nBookshop\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nKobo\n\nGoogle Play\n\nApple Books\n\nBryce, Denny S. The Trial of Mrs. Rhinelander. New York: Kensington, 2024.\n\nISBN-13: 978-1496737878 | $17.95 USD | 336 pages | Historical Fiction\n\nBlurb\n\nInspired by a real-life scandal that was shocking even for the tumultuous Roaring Twenties, this captivating novel tells the story of a pioneering Black journalist, a secret interracial marriage among the New York elite, and the sensational divorce case that ignited an explosive battle over race and class—and brought together three very different women fighting for justice, legitimacy, and the futures they risked everything to shape.\n\nFor readers of Dolen Perkins-Valdez, Marie Benedict and Victoria Christopher Murray, a transporting work of fact-based historical fiction from Denny S. Bryce, bestselling author of Wild Women and the Blues, In the Face of the Sun, and Can’t We Be Friends: A Novel of Ella Fitzgerald and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nNew York, 1920s. Born to English immigrants who’ve built a comfortable life, idealistic Alice Jones longs for the kind of true love her mother and father have. She believes she’s found it with Leonard “Kip” Rhinelander, the shy heir to his prominent white family’s real estate fortune. Alice, too, is white, though she is vaguely aware of rumors that question her ancestry—gossip her parents dismiss. But when the lovers secretly wed, Kip’s father threatens his inheritance unless he annuls the marriage.\n\nDevastated but determined, Alice faces overwhelming odds legally and in the merciless court of public opinion. But there are two people who can either help her—or shatter her hopes for good: In the 1940s, her estranged niece, Roberta Brooks, must put aside her disdain for her infamous aunt to combat an unexpected new Rhinelander legal assault. And in the 1920s, reporter Marvel Cunningham lives to chronicle social change and the Harlem Renaissance’s fiery creativity, but when Alice’s story dominates the headlines, Marvel’s job is to cover it.\n\nAt first, Marvel and Roberta, in different decades, see Alice’s legal entanglements as tabloid sensations generated by a self-hating woman who failed to “pass.” But the deeper they investigate, the more they will learn about the reasons behind Alice Jones’s behavior and what the three women have in common. The Trial of Mrs. Rhinelander will bring to light stunning truths that will force these women to confront who they are and who they can be in a world that is all too quick to judge.\n\nReview\n\n4 stars\n\nI received an ARC from the publisher via NetGalley and am voluntarily posting a review. All opinions are my own.\n\nI love how Denny S. Bryce’s books have introduced me to aspects of Black American history that I either knew very little about or knew nothing about prior to picking up her books. In the case of The Trial of Mrs. Rhinelander, it’s very much the latter, as I hadn’t heard of Alice Jones, the Rhinelander family, or Rhinelander v. Rhinelander case before. But this book has all the hallmarks of some of my favorite stories, like discussions of race and class relations, and how those play out both in the courts of law and public opinion via the newspapers.\n\nThe structure of this book is interesting, and it’s not unlike Bryce’s prior books in its dual timeline focus, but I also saw parallels to books like The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and Did You Hear About Kitty Karr?, particularly in its use of a journalist reporting on the story years later, not to mention discussing the issue of “passing” in high society as a parallel to Kitty Karr. With the more contemporary element being the weakest part of both (and dual timeline also being hit-or-miss for Bryce), I initially didn’t care for this structure, and found the chapters from Roberta’s perspective to be the weakest parts of the novel. But Bryce’s work here is aided by the fact that she reinforces Roberta’s personal connection to Alice, in addition to role as a journalist.\n\nI do feel that the blurb was a tad misleading in overselling the journalistic element though. While it’s a substantial part of the case and its aftermath, I didn’t feel it was so in the way the blurb presents it. The journalist Marvel who Alice befriends is mentioned in the blurb, and the blurb frames it as if Marvel has a large role at least equal to Roberta, and prior to picking it up, I worried that the book would follow the two journalists, with only limited glimpses of Alice, who is the true star of the book.\n\nSpeaking of which, I love Alice. She went through so much, and her family was simply trying to exist in the racist American society of the 1920s, which had different standards of race (the infamous “one-drop rule”) and Blackness in comparison to England, where the family hailed from. She fell in love with Lenny/Kip Rhinelander, who came from a wealthy family, and they got married, but his father made her justify her right to marry into the family, and demanded an annulment. To see how the aftereffects lingered far beyond when the original court case played out, until all the Rhinelanders involved had passed on, was truly intense.\n\nThis was an enlightening and emotionally moving read, and I’d recommend it to readers looking for historical fiction about strong Black women.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nDenny S.

New York: Avon, 2024.\n\nISBN-13: 9780062935656 | $9.99 USD | 368 pages | Regency Romance\n\nBlurb\n\nThe scandalous women of the USA Today bestselling author Scarlett Peckham’s Society of Sirens are back with the final stage in their fight for female rights—and this time the battle is to be waged in bed…\n\nShe’s the most infamous harlot in London…and she’s up for auction.\n\nThaïs Magadalene is a legend. The nation’s most notorious courtesan, she sells herself once a week, for one night only, and never to the same patron twice. Until now. To raise money for the cause of women’s rights, she has auctioned herself off for one month as mistress to the highest bidder.\n\nBut the winner is not who he seems.\n\nLord Alastair Eden is an earl, a radical politician, and a perfectionist in all things—except one. His confidence belies an unexpected secret: he doesn’t know how to please a woman in bed. He’s determined to change that before he marries. And who could be better than the most skilled lover in the country to teach him?\n\nAnd love is never for sale.\n\nThaïs dreams of finding a man who will love her unconditionally, never mind her past and reputation. Eden dreams of finding a perfectly bred young lady to be his wife and helpmeet. But when a steamy month in the countryside breeds a connection both in and out of the bedchamber, the two of them must decide how much can be sacrificed for love—one’s dreams, or one’s reputation.\n\nIn the series\n\n#1 The Rakess\n\n#2 The Portrait of a Duchess\n\nReview\n\n5 stars\n\nI received an ARC from the publisher via NetGalley and am voluntarily posting a review. All opinions are my own.\n\nThe Mistress Experience is the third and final book in Scarlett Peckham’s Society of Sirens series. It can be read as a stand-alone, but I’ve loved the series for its themes of sisterhood and tearing down the patriarchy, so I would recommend all the books.\n\nHowever, this one has a special place in my heart, as it’s one of my favorite tropes: sex lessons. And while the role reversal with the woman being the teacher has been done before, I loved the setup here in particular, in part due to the characters and their dynamic. Thaïs is a sought-after courtesan in London, but I loved her growth in realizing she wants domesticity, including marriage and a husband, while also being loud and unapologetic about her identity as a courtesan throughout the book. It was nice to have a balance for her, not having trauma around how she got into this line of work, while also craving “traditional” things too.\n\nAlistair is also wonderful. He’s buttoned-up, and not very sexually experienced, and his flaws in that department in the encounters he has had give him insecurities about how he might “perform” when he gets married. It was sweet, if a tad unusual, for him to solicit lessons for this purpose, but I liked that it made him stand out from a lot of the other heroes out there.\n\nThaïs and Alistair have a wonderful connection that grows over their just-over-a-month acquaintance, and I love how their romance balances both the physical intimacy as she proceeds in the lessons, and the growing emotional connection. While there is a bit where they have a conflict over him not being able to marry her because of her being a sex worker, I appreciate that this was handled sensitively, with him not diminishing her profession, and his perspective on marrying outside one’s class growing in a realistic way.\n\nAs this is the last book in the series (sob!), I love that it closed out some of the external plot threads, like Lady Elinor’s toxic marriage/pending divorce, not to mention the series closing out on a fun note including all the series leads, in addition to them all playing major roles in each others’ books. I love that all of the women and their partners ended up happy on their own terms, while also continuing to crusade for women’s rights.\n\nThis was perhaps my favorite book in the series (hard to believe since I practically made The Rakess my entire personality in 2020), and it’s in the running to be my favorite of the year. I’d strongly recommend this book if you’re interested in fiercely feminist, sex-positive historical romance.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nScarlett Peckham fell in love with romance novels as a child, sneaking paperbacks from the stash in her grandmother’s closet. By the time she came of age she had exhausted her library’s supply and begun to dream of writing one of her own.\n\nScarlett studied English at Columbia University and built a career in communications, but in her free hours always returned to her earliest obsession: those delicious, big-hearted books you devour in the dark and can never bear to put down. Her Golden Heart®-winning debut novel, The Duke I Tempted, was named a Best Romance Novel of 2018 by BookPage and The Washington Post and called “astonishingly good” by The New York Times Book Review.\n\nScarlett recently moved to Los Angeles after spending most of her life in Brooklyn and London. When not reading or writing romance she enjoys drinking immoderate quantities of white wine, watching The Real Housewives, and dressing her cat in bowtie.\n\nScarlett is represented by Sarah Younger at the Nancy Yost Literary Agency and spends far too much time on Instagram and Twitter.

In hindsight, was the choice to split a season of eight episodes, even if they’re all over an hour apiece, the best choice? Perhaps not, from a storytelling and pacing standpoint, with a lot of the setup in the front half, especially for the supporting characters feeling like filler. But from a marketing standpoint, I get why Netflix chose to do this, as they’ve begun to increasingly do for more of their content overall, as even negative press worked out well for the show in the long run.\n\nAs I spoke about my initial thoughts in my Part 1 review, I will be mostly discussing how elements introduced paid off, while also discussing new elements introduced.\n\nPolin’s HEA\n\nThe most frustrating bit of discourse was the speculation that Pen and Colin wouldn’t have a happy ending (Colin not having groveled enough for not noticing Pen’s secret crush was a very close second). But if the first part paid homage to some of the beats of their early romance, you see more of that in part two. While the Whistledown of it all hangs over their heads a lot longer (goddamn, do these writers like to draw out the drama!), I love that it ultimately comes down to Colin’s desire for purpose, as a partner for Penelope and in life.\n\nLady Whistledown’s Fate and Penelope’s Growth\n\nA big concern was how the Whistledown reveal would be handled, if indeed it would at all. LW has become such an instrumental part of the show, with the social media teams on the show’s Twitter and Instagram incorporating it into their posts. And Julie Andrews’ occasional snippets of narration are an absolute highlight of every episode.\n\nBut the writers have found a compromise that honors Penelope’s journey of developing self-confidence, honoring the need for her to come out into the light, both to take accountability for the wrong she has done and to shine in her own right. While I don’t know that people would be so forgiving of someone in reality, it helps that Penelope is generally likable, although often underestimated. And at the end of the day, like in the book, she has the support of all her family, Featherington and Bridgerton. Even Queen Charlotte seems moved to forgive her, in spite of Whistledown being Public Enemy Number 1 for Charlotte for most of the show thus far. But my favorite part of all this was, while the close bond between Penelope and Lady Danbury has not been present thus far, I enjoyed that Lady D’s perceptiveness was revealed where Penelope was concerned, due to their mutual closeness with the Bridgertons.\n\nPortia Sees Penelope and Butterflies Fly\n\nI’ve gone back and forth on my feelings on Portia, alternately respecting her for the lengths she takes to protect her girls, and also chafing at her general disregard for Penelope and her agency. This part of the season sees Colin telling Portia off for this, which changes her tune, initially for performative reasons. But I love the acknowledgment that Penelope is the daughter who is most like Portia, particularly as both of them face major crises, Penelope’s being related to Whistledown and Portia’s being the house of cards she created with the lie about the money she and Jack embezzled, plus the fraudulent terms for inheriting/keeping the title. And even the other sisters, particularly the more prickly Prudence, acknowledge Penelope’s more subtle genius. And speaking of subtle genius, a broken clock is right twice a day, and Philipa’s choice to incorporate butterflies into the climactic moment of the ball and Prudence were throwing was brilliant.\n\nEloise and Penelope Make Up, Cressida Ousted\n\nI was very much rooting for Eloise and Penelope to make up, and I mostly appreciate how they did it. Eloise has shown that, despite her tunnel vision and self-centeredness at times, she doesn’t like to see Pen or any of her family hurt, and that continues this season. She quickly realizes the falseness of her friendship with Cressida, and while in their “breakup,” Cressida does unintentionally parrot Penelope’s season 2 tirade about how Eloise is “all talk,” and hasn’t actual done anything with her life, it rings hollow from Cressida, who also hasn’t done anything of note. And while I can understand Cressida’s perspective, given the toxic family situation she lives in, of which Eloise is largely ignorant, Cressida brought her fate upon herself, as she failed to scheme with as much forethought as either Penelope or Portia Featherington, and clung to heavily to the ideology bred into her that they can’t depend on anyone. I have mixed feelings about Cressida’s regression, especially since she had a lot of potential, and as women, Penelope and Cressida in particular were fighting similar battles with the patriarchy in different ways. And given that Portia, Prudence, and Philipa have found redemption and mended things with Penelope, I don’t know why Cressida couldn’t.\n\nLady Danbury’s Conflict With Her Brother and Friendship with Violet\n\nThis was yet another source for the wildest discourse, including people claiming Marcus was Simon’s real father, because of the “healthy seed” line from season 2, which I always interpreted as being meant to push back on the rhetoric that it was always the woman’s fault, something that was so common historically. It’s basically the reason Henry VIII got married so many times, when the fault may have been with him all along (If interested, go down the rabbit-hole of Henry VIII possibly having Kell-positive blood; it’s fascinating).\n\nBut the truth is much more in line with what I expected, and it had something to do with the fact that they were very much estranged during the past timeline of Queen Charlotte, with her even stating at least that she had no family to rely on when her husband died. Given the state of her loveless, borderline abusive marriage to the lech Lord Danbury, I was unsurprised to learn she tried to get out of it, and these plans were thwarted by Marcus who told their father. But I was saddened by how a misunderstanding of intentions got between them, with him actually respecting her but also wanting to protect her, but she resented him because of it resulting in her having to get married.\n\nIn the meantime, her protectiveness over Violet was very sweet, with her even basically laying down the gauntlet to Marcus at one point (prior to them making amends) that Violet is her friend, and she’d look after her friend’s interests, and Violet in turn is only interested in pursuing things once both of their families’ issues are settled. While she does ease up towards the end of the season, I enjoyed how it allowed for more bonding between the two women, including a moment where the past between Lady D and Violet’s father is finally acknowledged. And while things end on a good note overall, with Marcus and Violet slowly exploring their relationship at season’s end, I do wish it hadn’t come together without some tag-teaming from Lady D and Anthony, whose protective side also returned in one of his brief reappearances. While he didn’t do Daphne any favors, I would love to see Anthony defending his mother’s honor.\n\nQueer Rep at Last!: What Does This Mean for Benedict, Francesca, and Perhaps Eloise?\n\nThis is the section where I will implore you to temporarily ignore almost everything I said in the intro about the episode release schedule, because if nothing else releasing Part 2 during Pride Month was genius. While there have been queer characters before, like Mr. Granville from season 1 or Brimsley and Reynolds, they’re either one-offs or characters who don’t get a happy ending. And while the aforementioned Mr. Granville did have people thinking Benedict could be queer, the writers have at long last delivered on it in a somewhat tangible way, with Benedict’s romance with Lady Tilley turning into something more unconventional with her artsy “friend,” Paul in the mix too. It was great to see his eyes continue to be opened about people who choose to live outside the norms he grew up with, and thus broaden the possibilities for how his own romance could play out. And as an occasional reader of MMF romance, even though I knew this wouldn’t be endgame, I like that this put that possibility on the table in addition to a monogamous queer relationship.\n\nIn regards to Francesca and John, I had heard rumors about a certain queer shakeup for Michael coming, along with backlash from a certain segment of book fans, but I didn’t want to get my hopes up about it. But sure enough, this did occur, and Michaela Stirling shows up near the end of the season, not long after Francesca and John’s wedding. And while the brief interaction wasn’t a lot to go off, Michaela definitely made an impression, not just on Francesca, but also Eloise, who has decided to spend some time in Scotland with the newlyweds to see more of the world. While it’s hard to say definitively how this will all pan out, there are a number of possibilities already, with both Eloise and Francesca to an extent being theorized to be queer as well. I don’t think Francesca in particular being queer negates the bond she has with John at all, as they’re shown to have a sweet relationship. And it’s very possible something Benedict said about being able to love more than one person, which was applied in the platonic sense to Eloise regarding her bonds with Penelope and Colin, and later resulted in his decision to pursue things with Tilley and Paul, could foreshadow the fate of things for Francesca, John, and Michaela. And a big part of her book was that she still loved John, but in a different way, so I don’t know why it bothers people that Michael is now Michaela, unless they’re biphobic. And in response to those crying about the possible loss of the infertility storyline, I’d like to cycle back to the bit in my intro to the Lady Danbury section, and point out that people in history didn’t have the knowledge we know now to know for certain what caused their fertility issues, so to treat that book as God-tier rep for infertile women, when Book Francesca ends up having kids with “the right person,” which isn’t even a reality for many infertile people, and this myth is still perpetuated by romance novels today? And that being queer doesn’t mean the fertility plotline can’t exist, but that it might be handled a different way, with more sensitivity towards those whose stories didn’t end in miracle pregnancies?\n\nAnd with that, I wish every person who makes comments like this the curse of stepping on Legos constantly for the rest of their hateful existence. The show has transcended the books’ audience at this point, and won’t fail because some homophobic Lady Karen de Bourghs (credit to Bianca of Bookhoarding for this term) stop watching.\n\nWill and Alice\n\nNot much to say here, but I’m sad Will is selling the club. But it was fun to see more “buddy”moments with him, Benedict, Colin, and now John. And Will and Alice being mentored by Lady Danbury has been a nice touch, as she also went through something similar.\n\nThe Absence of Simon and Daphne\n\nI can’t remember if I remarked on it in previous reviews, but I do believe that Simon not returning didn’t impact much in season 2 or season 3 part 1, with his friendship with Will being the main exception, although the Bridgerton boys have all filled the void there, more or less. I’d have loved to hear Simon’s thoughts on Will’s new prospects and his decision about the club, but otherwise, I’m not bothered, and I wish Regé-Jean Page well in all his new endeavors. And while I wish the same for Phoebe Dynevor, I did miss her presence in the second half in particular. She wouldn’t have had much to do, so U understand her not coming back, but while Simon and Daphne missing two family weddings is very noticeable, even more so than Simon’s absence from the farce that was Anthony’s failed wedding to Edwina last season, or the events in the fallout from that. Also, given how both were present in the events surrounding Colin’s scandalous betrothal with Marina, it does seem odd, even if there was another narrative purpose. I suppose that is one silver lining to the Kanthony wedding happening off-screen, as much as fans wished they’d seen it…we can debate whether Simon and Daphne would have attended or not, without anyone being wrong.\n\nAnthony and Kate, and the Returning Lead Conundrum\n\nI feel like they’ve struck a perfect balance in their inclusion of Kanthony here, after their soaring inclusion in part 1. Whether it was solely because of Jonathan Bailey’s commitment to Wicked or other reasons, I feel they were better incorporated than Daphne was last season. I liked seeing them pop in to give love advice to Colin when he was struggling with Penelope’s LW secret in particular, and while he did not divulge the exact details, I love how Kate in particular was helpful in providing advice on how to handle disagreements with someone you love. I also loved seeing Kate and Eloise have a moment together when Eloise is still on the outs with Penelope. And while Anthony is absent from a lot of the “bachelor party” shenanigans, that scene from the promos where he’s shocked and even outraged on Penelope’s behalf at what transpired between her and Colin, while Benedict is impressed, is one of the best moments overall.\n\nAs both Luke Newton and Nicola Coughlan have confirmed they will be returning for future seasons, I feel like this set the blueprint for how to turn a lead couple into a supporting couple, as has not been attempted prior, although it will be interesting to see how that works out, given how much the writers seem to love Penelope as a character.\n\nThe Music\n\nOne plus to the season being split was getting even more string covers! “Yellow” by Coldplay being the Polin wedding song was iconic, as Luke Newton posted a cover of the song on YouTube, not to mention yellow has been one of Penelope’s colors prior to her glow up this season. “You Belong With Me” by Taylor Swift is the ultimate Polin song, and I was delighted to see it being used in a dance sequence. And Demi Lovato’s “Confident” was definitely one of my favorite picks overall so far.\n\nConcluding Thoughts/Hopes for the Future\n\nThis season set up a lot of groundwork for the next couple seasons, and I can’t wait to see it all play out! The hint at the Masquerade next year piques my interest given the direction of Benedict’s story, and of course, there’s hopes for Eloise to continue her growth and exploration, and Francesca to bond with her new family and see where that takes her, whether it all falls in line with the books or not. And as the show goes on, I continue to marvel at the rapid growth of Will Tilston (Gregory) and Florence Hunt (Hyacinth), with them now both being 17. While the Francesca recasting had to do with scheduling conflicts, it’s very possible Will and Florence will be able to grow into the status of romantic leads, if that aligns with their wishes, especially with the show’s filming and release schedule now promising a season roughly every two years, as unbearable of a wait that is.\n\nSo, overall, I continue to enjoy the show, and my hopes are high. While I repeat my encouragement that the pissed off Lady (and Lord) Karens go off into a corner and be pissed by themselves, I’d otherwise recommend it to those who’ve enjoyed the show thus far.\n\nMorris, Wanda M. What You Leave Behind. New York: William Morrow, 2024.\n\nISBN-13: 978-0063322219 | $18.99 USD | 384 pages | Thriller\n\nBlurb\n\nAward-winning author Wanda Morris returns with a powerful, haunting thriller following a lawyer who after the mysterious disappearance of a local landowner and the death of his sister just months before, uncovers a conspiracy that dates back to Reconstruction and persists in half the United States today.\n\nDeena Wood’s life has fallen apart in the aftermath of losing her beloved mother, her marriage, and her prestigious job at an Atlanta law firm. She needs what the Geechee people of coastal Georgia call a “dayclean,” a fresh start.\n\nShe returns to her childhood home in Brunswick, Georgia, to heal. But her return is anything but the respite she thought it might be. To make peace with all her loss, she often drives through the city. One day, she unwittingly finds herself on the oceanfront property of a loner widower who is fighting to keep land that has been in his family since the end of the Civil War. He threatens her and warns her to never return. But shortly after, he disappears, and his very expensive property is quickly put up for sale. Curious about what has happened to the man, Deena digs into his disappearance and finds a family legacy at risk. What starts out as a bit of curious snooping, turns into a deadly game of illegal land grabs and property redevelopment in poor and rural communities with dark and powerful forces at work.\n\nWithout realizing it, Deena finds herself caught up in a nightmarish scheme that threatens her community and her family. She’ll need help and finds it in a close but unlikely source because she knows she must do whatever it takes to stop the sinister forces at play before she becomes their next target.\n\nReview\n\n4 stars\n\nI received an ARC from the publisher via NetGalley and am voluntarily posting a review. All opinions are my own.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed Wanda M. Morris’s first thriller, her second was a bit of a dud for me. However, What You Leave Behind sounded promising. Sure enough, I ended up enjoying this one quite a bit more. Morris blends social commentary and history impeccably with her mystery plot, keeping me intrigued throughout.\n\nOne thing I noticed early on was the great sense of place, with the narrative drawing the reader into the Brunswick, Georgia setting. The story also delves into the history of Black people during Reconstruction, including that of the Geechee-Gullah community specifically, something I was not super informed about. The story also delves into the heirs property system and its impact on Black and brown communities, consolidating the wealth among the few (mostly white) wealthy people.\n\nDeena as a protagonist is sympathetic, even if her life is messy and she’s flawed. She’s returned home after a messy divorce, and her father has speedily remarried after her mother’s death, so Deena has a frosty relationship with her stepmother, and with so much happening to her all at once, it’s like her life is falling apart. But I appreciate that, while she’s going through a lot, she still has guts, and while she doesn’t always make the wisest of decisions, she has spine and stands up for what’s right in the face of injustice.\n\nThe plot is engaging, and fairly steadily paced. Between the family drama and the missing person and the land grab plot, there was a lot going on that kept me on the edge of my seat and wondering how it would all come together.\n\nThis was a solid return to form for Wanda M. Morris, and I am now once again interested in reading more from her in the future. I’d recommend this to readers who enjoy mystery/thrillers starring Black leads that also bring up relevant social issues.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nWanda M.

When the Duke Was Wicked. New York: Avon, 2014.\n\nISBN-13:978-0062276223 | $7.99 USD | 374 pages | Victorian Romance\n\nBlurb\n\nLady Grace Mabry’s ample inheritance has made it impossible for her to tell whether a suitor is in love with her—or enamored of her riches. Who better to distinguish beau from blackguard than her notorious childhood friend, the Duke of Lovingdon?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nWith no interest in marriage, Lovingdon has long lived only for pleasure. He sees little harm in helping Grace find a proper match. After all, he’s familiar with all the ploys a scoundrel uses to gain a woman’s favor. He simply has to teach the lovely innocent how to distinguish honest emotions from false ones. How better than by demonstrating his wicked ways. But as lessons lead to torrid passion and Grace becomes ensnared in another man’s marriage plot, Lovingdon must wage a desperate gamble: Open his heart fully—or risk losing the woman he adores…\n\nReview\n\n4 stars\n\nI was both super-excited and rather nervous to start the Scandalous Gentlemen of St. James series, as the Scoundrels had largely been such a top-tier series for me. I wanted more of the world and the characters, and I knew already that Lorraine Heath could pull off in writing multigenerational stories, but it’s somewhat different when you already have an image of one of the protagonists as a child. However, When the Duke Was Wicked more or less fulfilled my expectations.\n\nThere were parts of Lovingdon’s arc that made me cringe a little, like his commitment to debauchery after losing his wife and daughter, while also wallowing in the loss of them. But given his mother was also a widow in her own book, albeit in different circumstances, and he had been set up to be rather soft-hearted, it’s easy to believe that he’d take the loss of those he loved hard and turn to rakish behavior to numb the pain. I appreciated the way the narrative focused on his grieving process, with him slowly learning to let go of his previous wife and stop living in the past in order to move on.\n\nI had a bit of an inkling what Grace was like from her supporting role in Minerva’s book, but even before her marriage, I like that she’s equally strong-willed. She does have moments of naivete, but I love that she has an unconventional side too, as only Frannie and Sterling’s daughter would, engaging in activities like playing cards at Dodger’s with the boys and smoking, not to mention sneaking out at all hours of the night.\n\nWith their families being best friends and having grown up together, I loved the banter between Grace and Lovingdon. I did worry initially, as their history includes her having a childhood crush on him, that persisted until his first marriage. However, while the lingering attraction is implied, she is as committed to finding someone else to marry as he is to his hedonism for a good portion of the book. This leads to great interplay between them, as he “helps” her sort through her myriad suitors, and the sparks fly between them.\n\nWith it now being the second generation, I loved getting updates on how some of the older characters have ended up, as well as how their children are doing, in preparation for their own eventual HEAs. I was particularly touched by Grace’s relationship with her father, with her revelation that she wants to dance with him at her wedding before he entirely loses his sight. And I also love the bond she has with her adoptive brother, Drake, formerly Peter Sykes.\n\nWith the shift to focusing more on the upper-crust, there’s more domestic and romantic drama over mystery and intrigue. However, there is an external crisis which complements the internal one, contributing to an emotionally satisfying ending.\n\nThis was a great way to kick off the Scandalous Gentlemen of St. James series, and I’d recommend it to readers who enjoy angsty, emotional historical romance.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nLorraine Heath always dreamed of being a writer.

But soon nothing can keep her from the arms of the sinfully attractive scoundrel, not even the dangerous secrets she keeps. Strong, compassionate, and utterly irresistible, James is all she desires. But can she trust him enough to let herself succumb to all the pleasures that midnight allows?\n\nJames Swindler has worked hard to atone for his unsavory past. He is now as at home in London’s glittering salons as he is in the roughest streets. But when the inspector is tasked with keeping watch on a mysterious lady suspected of nefarious deeds, he is determined to use his skills at seduction to lure Eleanor into revealing her plans. Instead, he is the one seduced, turning away from everything he holds dear in order to protect her—no matter the cost to his heart. ​\n\nIn the series\n\n#1 In Bed with the Devil\n\n#2 Between the Devil and Desire\n\n#3 Surrender to the Devil\n\nReview\n\n4 stars\n\nMidnight Pleasures with a Scoundrel is a great final full novel in the Scoundrels of St. James series. Lorraine Heath once again blends angsty romance with mystery and intrigue in an expert way, making me root for these characters every step of the way. This one is perhaps the most self-contained of the series, although I would recommend the series overall for the recurring dynamics among the primary cast.\n\nI didn’t know entirely what to expect what James Swindler, as while he’s been present in the other books, he wasn’t as vibrant as the others. I did think it was interesting to get his side of his relationship with Frannie, with him having been infatuated with her, while the others were more protective in a brotherly way. I also enjoyed learning more about his background, and how his life on the streets having his father’s execution led him to his current path as an inspector for Scotland Yard and working to fight for justice. While the “cop” characters can often be symbols of corruption, regardless of the genre, I like how he works against the system to help the most vulnerable and bring down the powerful and corrupt.\n\nI was initially unsure how to discuss the plot twist where the FMC was concerned, but while the blurb calls her Eleanor, the St. James Character Guide on Lorraine Heath’s website calls her Emma. For the sake of consistency, I’ll use Emma, while noting that her identity is purposely written in a misleading way to serve the plot. And when I found out the twist as to why it was, and her motivations for doing so, I felt a little conflicted at the deception, but I also could not help but admire her bravery, and feel for her loss, and how she felt the need to take justice into her own hands.\n\nAnd while the deception initially extended to James, once all things are sorted out, it’s clear how well-suited they are for each other, as both share a deep passion for justice for the innocent and vulnerable. This emotional connection is also complemented by a strong physical and sexual chemistry.\n\nThe intrigue and danger are high this time around, including a murder investigation and a dark secret society. I was just as intrigued in how that would all shake out as I was in the romance.\n\nThis was another brilliant book from Lorraine Heath, and I’m excited for what comes next with the next generation. If you’re interested in emotional historical romance with a dash of mystery, I’d recommend checking this one out!\n\nBuy links\n\nBookshop\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nKobo\n\nGoogle Play\n\nApple Books\n\nHeath, Lorraine. The Last Wicked Scoundrel. New York: Avon Impulse, 2014.\n\nISBN-13: 978-0062317162 | $4.99 USD | 176 pages | Victorian Romance\n\nBlurb\n\nWilliam Graves is the last of Feagan’s scoundrels. A onetime grave robber turned royal physician, he has devoted his life to saving others—because he knows there is no way to save himself. Especially not around a lady like Winnie. Though undeserving of her touch, he cannot resist. His passion cannot be tamed…even in the face of certain danger.\n\nWinnie, the Duchess of Avendale, never knew peace until her brutal husband died. With William she’s discovered burning desire—and the healing power of love. But now, confronted by the past she thought she’d left behind, Winnie must face her fears…or risk losing the one man who can fulfill all her dreams.​\n\nReview\n\n4 stars\n\nI was a bit apprehensive about both the final Scoundrel’s love story and the repercussions of what happened to the Duke of Avendale being relegated to a novella, especially with the next Duke being a prominent character in the follow up series, but this book surprised me by being able to do a lot with a fairly short book. Like Heath’s later novella, When the Marquess Falls, while the romance is prominent, it’s fairly simple in comparison to others in the series, letting other plot elements shine.\n\nI enjoyed getting to know William, who has a tragic backstory of his own that led to him joining up with the Scoundrels, including life with an abusive mother whose death he was responsible for and being abandoned by his father. Winnie, meanwhile, is still recovering from the physical and emotional trauma of her abusive marriage, and believes he’s come back to haunt her.\n\nI loved the dynamic between William and Winnie, dating back to the first book, when he cared for her when she was injured, with the simmering tensions now very apparent. It’s complicated by William’s role in dispensing with her husband in the first book, along with the other Scoundrels, and Winnie’s close friend Catherine, and their conflicted feelings about what to do, and if they should tell her.\n\nThe suspense over if Avendale had managed to return, and then when and how he’d show up had me waiting with bated breath. The story culminates in an epic showdown that was dangerous, but satisfying in how it wrapped things up.\n\nThis is a satisfying conclusion for the Scoundrels of St. James series, and I’d recommend it, and the rest of the series, to readers who enjoy emotional romance with a dash of mystery.\n\nBuy links\n\nBookshop\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nKobo\n\nGoogle Play\n\nApple Books\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nLorraine Heath always dreamed of being a writer.

New York: Avon, 2009.\n\nISBN-13: 978-0061733994 | $8.99 USD | 384 pages | Victorian Romance\n\nBlurb\n\nA Devilish Duke on a Quest for Pleasure . . .\n\nFrannie Darling was once a child of London’s roughest streets, surrounded by petty thieves, pickpockets, and worse. But though she survived this harsh upbringing to become a woman of incomparable beauty, Frannie wants nothing to do with the men who lust for her, the rogues who frequent the gaming hall where she works. She can take care of herself and feels perfectly safe on her own—safe, that is, until he strides into her world, and once again it becomes a very dangerous place indeed.\n\nTo bed her but not wed her. That’s what Sterling Mabry, the eighth Duke of Greystone, wants. But Frannie abhors arrogant aristocrats interested only in their own pleasure. So why then does the thought of an illicit tryst with the devilish duke leave her trembling with desire? Her willing body begs for release . . . and a wicked, wonderful surrender.\n\nIn the series\n\n#1 In Bed with the Devil\n\n#2 Between the Devil and Desire\n\nReview\n\n4 stars\n\nSurrender to the Devil is the third in Lorraine Heath’s Scoundrels of St. James series. It can be read as a standalone, and has less of the fear of spoilers that the previous book did, especially as part of it overlaps timeline wise with the previous book. But I would recommend the other books, as part of what makes the series so great is the relationships between the titular scoundrels.\n\nFrannie is an absolute delight. Like the “Scoundrels” of the prior books, she was raised on the streets and has dealt with her own share of trauma as a result, including being sold to a brothel at twelve, which also ties into the backstories of the heroes of the prior two books. As a result, the others are very protective of her, but I love that she’s strong-willed, competent, and can take care of herself. Like Jack particularly, she also has no illusions about the aristocratic world, and this has previously been her reasoning behind refusing to marry Luke, although it’s implied all of the Scoundrels have or had complicated feelings for her, which she doesn’t reciprocate. I also love how her and the others’ experiences on the streets, and knowing how not everyone was as kind as Feagan and the late Earl of Claybourne, motivates her current work with orphans, founding a home for them, with aspirations to do more.\n\nI admit I was a bit apprehensive about Sterling at first, as Duke heroes with working-class women have often pissed me off, and Heath’s subsequent books subverting this dynamic did little to assuage me. But Sterling also mystified me, as there were allusions to how he had “changed” since returning from his travels abroad from his sister Catherine’s perspective. But while he did have moments where he asserted his “alpha-ness,” he never overstepped, and had a good sense of self-awareness and empathy for Frannie, which later extended to the orphans she cared for. And learning about what brought about the change in him, first subtly in his internal monologue, and later in his love confession, was beautiful.\n\nTheir romance was super-sweet, and somewhat lower-stakes than the previous ones while still being high in angst and tension. When I initially read the blurb, I thought I knew how it would play out, with the two having an illicit affair. And while that does happen, there’s a bit more back-and-forth than I expected, as they dance around each other, and I particularly respected how Frannie’s agency in the matter was always acknowledged, whether it be between them, or when Sterling was confronted by some combination of the other Scoundrels in Overprotective Big Brother mode a few times. While this book did have a bit of a lull in the tension somewhere in the middle, the third-act conflict posing danger to their lives and demonstrating how well they truly do work for each other, in spite of their superficial differences, truly touched my heart.\n\nAnd while this installment was lighter on the Dickens references and allusions for most of the book, with Frannie not being a direct analogue for any one character, my jaw dropped when Charles Dickens himself showed up at the end!\n\nI really enjoyed this one, and would recommend it to readers interested in emotionally moving historical romance.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nLorraine Heath always dreamed of being a writer.

There’s no pleasure he hasn’t enjoyed, no debauchery the handsome scoundrel won’t provide for the lords who flock to his house of carnal intrigue.\n\nLondon’s most virtuous lady—honorable, uncorrupted, and all too human\n\nOlivia, Duchess of Lovingdon, would never associate with such a rogue. So when Jack is named sole heir to the duke’s personal possessions, the beautiful, well-bred lady is outraged. Now, Olivia is forced to share her beloved home with this despicable man.\n\nCaught between the devil and desire\n\nBut Olivia’s icy disdain is no match for Jack’s dangerous charm. His touch awakens desire. His kiss demands surrender. She will struggle to bar Jack from her heart . . . but her body, coveting divine release, will not let her bar him from her bed.\n\nIn the series\n\n#1 In Bed with the Devil\n\nReview\n\n5 stars\n\nBetween the Devil and Desire is yet another top-tier Lorraine Heath book, and I can understand why other readers consider this series her best. Following very closely, timeline wise, after its predecessor, it’s chock-full of more intrigue, angst, and swoony, sexy romance. And while the romance can stand on its own, there are some spoilers for non-romance related elements of the first book.\n\nJack was an absolute delight in the first book, and continues to be so in this one. He’s very much a rogue, but he’s quite a nuanced one. He has a devil-may-care attitude, a trait he developed as a result of the trauma he experienced early in his life, and I would like to warn readers new to the series that his past includes references and discussions (but no graphic depictions) of child sexual abuse. His complex bond with Luke, hero of the last book, is also explored further, particularly in relation to his role in the previously mentioned plot twist and its ramifications on their relationship. But in spite of all he experienced, or perhaps because of it, he also cares deeply for those he loves, especially his fellow Scoundrels, and while he initially dithers about taking on the role of guardian to Henry, the new Duke of Lovingdon, especially as he was unsettled by the previous Duke’s motivations, he becomes close to him as well.\n\nOlivia is also quite interesting. A foil for Jack, she’s very proper and buttoned-up. My interest was piqued when I learned early in the book she was sister to the Duke of Avendale, a supporting character from the prior book, particularly as her perspective presented insight into his behavior that mirrored those which played a role in the previous book’s plot. But I was also intrigued by the complex nature of her prior marriage, with the late Duke of Lovingdon keeping more secrets close to his chest than she knew.\n\nThe romance started on a delightful front, much funnier than I’m used to from Heath. Jack and Olivia engage in witty banter as they argue over the ins and outs of how Henry will be raised, not to mention disagreements over the distribution of the late Duke’s estate in Jack’s favor. Things gradually take a dark turn, with family secrets coming to light, and them fighting their desire for one another despite the taboo nature of their relationship. I loved how they pushed each other’s buttons and wound each other up, while also waiting with bated breath for their illicit kisses, and more.\n\nHeath really brought the drama with this one, including a messy family tree that feels like it’s out of a soap opera. I had an inkling as to what Lovingdon’s connection might be, but even with all the foreshadowing, it caught me off guard just as much as it did for both Jack and Olivia. The final twist in particular blew me away, because I was so certain I had to be wrong, because “no way Lorraine would do this,” and she did?!\n\nThis book was perhaps even better than the last, and I’d recommend it to readers looking for a dramatic, angsty historical romance.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nLorraine Heath always dreamed of being a writer.

A proper young lady risks more than her reputation when consorting with the roguishly handsome Lucian Langdon, but Lady Catherine Mabry believes she has no choice. To protect those she loves, she would do anything—even strike a bargain with the devil himself.\n\nLucian desires respectability and a wife above all else, but the woman of his choosing lacks the social graces to be accepted by the aristocracy. Catherine can help Lucian gain everything he wants. But what she asks for in exchange will put their very lives in jeopardy. When danger closes in, Catherine discovers a man of immense passion and he discovers a woman of immeasurable courage. As secrets from his dark past are revealed, Lucian begins to question everything he knows to be true, including the yearnings of his own heart.\n\nReview\n\n5 stars\n\nThe “St. James” world that Lorraine Heath has created is the one series that most intrigued me, and despite any difficulties tracking down some of the books, I was determined to read these in order, in spite of having had no issue reading the Hellions spinoff and other books which also reference some of these characters, and Heath’s disclaimer that all the books stand alone. And thus far, that seems to be a wise decision, as In Bed with the Devil serves as a brilliant introduction to the initial cast of characters and their various connections with one another, plus providing context for how certain things may shake out in future books. I admit I was surprised that I didn’t catch the Oliver Twist references until I was a good way into the book (or even suspect that the “Dodger” family were an homage to “The Artful Dodger,” from having met them later in the timeline in Falling Into Bed with a Duke), so that was a pleasant surprise, and I love the meta way the story name-drops it later in the book.\n\nThe two major characters are incredibly compelling and sympathetic. Luke has a dark past, having grown up on the streets among his fellow “Scoundrels,” including being convicted of murdering the heir to the earldom of Claybourne, only to have the then-current earl recognize him as a his grandson, despite Luke having no memories of their connection. The impostor syndrome and conflicting feelings he feels were well-rendered, and in spite of him being very morally gray, I love that he had his heart in the right place, always sticking up for the vulnerable, the way not many in the aristocracy would, although the fact that he’s killed someone at all has earned him a blackened reputation.\n\nCatherine has a very similar spirit and big heart, in that she is desperate to help her friend, Winifred, who is trapped in an abusive marriage. I admire her resourcefulness in seeking out Luke, in spite of the risk it might pose to her own reputation to be associated with him.\n\nI loved the dynamic between these two. Even with them both being similarly big-hearted and selfless, this gets in the way of their road to happiness too. Luke has long had a connection with his childhood friend, Frannie, and spent a good deal of time believing he wanted to marry her, in spite of her rebuffing him, due to them technically running in different circles since he became the earl. Catherine selflessly gives her heart and virtue to Luke, but later keeps her distance, believing he’s still committed to Frannie. There’s also the way the two women’s conflicting stations tie into Luke’s identity crisis, with him unclear about whether he belongs in the aristocratic world for a good portion of the book. While some of these aspects, including a third-act pregnancy, might sometimes annoy me, Heath used these plot devices to expert effect, making me root for these characters the whole way.\n\nAnd with a generous helping of suspense and danger, this also makes for a fairly engaging read beyond the romance too. From the intrigue of life on the streets to the gritty (possibly temporary, if later book blurbs are any indication) resolution to the domestic violence storyline, there was a lot going on, without forgetting to center the main romance.\n\nThis was a brilliant first book, and I can’t wait to see what’s to come in the future books! I’d recommend this if you’re looking for a dark, angsty historical romance.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nLorraine Heath always dreamed of being a writer.

Elizabeth of East Hampton. New York: Gallery Books, 2024.\n\nISBN-13: 978-1668052556 | $18.99 USD | 384 pages | Contemporary Romance\n\nBlurb\n\nThis fresh and whip-smart modern retelling of Jane Austen’s classic Pride and Prejudice—from the authors of the “great beach read” (Bookreporter) Emma of 83rd Street—transports you to summer in the Hamptons, where classes clash, rumors run wild, and love has a frustrating habit of popping up where you least expect it.\n\nIt’s a truth universally acknowledged—well, by Elizabeth Bennet anyway—that there’s nothing worse than summer in the Hamptons. She should know: she’s lived out there her whole life. Every June, her hometown on the edge of Long Island is inundated with rich Manhattanites who party until dawn and then disappear by September. And after twenty-five years, Lizzy wants to leave, too.\n\nBut after putting her own dreams on hold to help save her family’s failing bakery, she’s still surfing the same beach every morning and waiting for something, anything, to change. She’s not holding her breath though, not even when her sister starts flirting with the hot new bachelor in town, Charlie Pierce, and he introduces Lizzy to his even hotter friend.\n\nWill Darcy is everything Lizzy Bennet is not. Aloof, arrogant…and rich. Of course, he’s never cared about money. In fact, it’s number one on his long list of things that irk him. Number two? His friend Charlie’s insistence on setting him up with his new girlfriend’s sharp-tongued sister. Lizzy Bennet is all wrong for him, from her money-hungry family to her uncanny ability to speak to him as bluntly as he does everyone else. But then maybe that’s why he can’t stop thinking about her.\n\nLizzy is sure Will hates everybody. He thinks she willfully misunderstands them. Yet, just as they strike an uneasy truce, mistakes threaten Charlie and Jane’s romance, with Will and Lizzy caught in the undertow. Between a hurricane and a hypocritical aunt, a drunken voicemail and a deceptive party promoter, the two must sift through the gossip and lies to protect the happiness of everyone they love—even if it means sacrificing their own. But when the truth also forces them to see each other in an entirely new light, they must swallow their pride to learn that love is a lot like surfing: sometimes the only way to survive is to let yourself fall.\n\nIn the series\n\n#1 Emma of 83rd Street\n\nReview\n\n3 stars\n\nI received an ARC from the publisher via NetGalley and am voluntarily posting a review. All opinions are my own.\n\nI really enjoyed Audrey Bellezza and Emily Harding’s Emma of 83rd Street, and was hyped when the story hinted at a possible P&P follow up. Elizabeth of East Hampton is almost as charming as its predecessor, but I do feel like the authors’ desire to stay fairly loyal to the source material came back to bite them, resulting in some issues.\n\nThe characters and their dynamics are fairly solid. I loved Lizzy and her family, and how similar they felt to the generally chaotic nature of the original. The financial issues, in spite of existing within an elite world among the super-wealthy, in this case New York, was well-conveyed. Lizzy herself is a bit of an idealist and a dreamer, longing for more, yet not able to reach for it and feeling confined by that. Each of the family members was translated to the modern world in a believable way, from Mrs. Bennet being into MLMs, and Lydia being an influencer. Mary even gets some love, being an activist who plays an active role in the latter part of the plot.\n\nI generally liked the romance between Lizzy and Will Darcy. The dynamic between them is fairly similar to the original, with respect and then passion and love growing.\n\nBut there were ways in which this book’s need to follow the plot and even character beats of the original left me feeling underwhelmed. There are so many superfluous characters, including the sisters, that I understand why some of my favorite modern adaptations (The Lizzie Bennet Diaries) chose to cut and condense the cast. In making Mary more relevant and centering her as the crisis point, the authors made a solid choice by removing sexual stigma attached to the Lydia character and highlighting activism and the unjust response to civil disobedience instead. But Lydia and Kitty, meanwhile, simply exist for little purpose. And with how slow the book was overall, especially in the second half, even Jane and Charlie’s relevance felt debatable. Add in more overlap with the last book (both Emma and George Knightley appear), and it all just felt needlessly overstuffed with characters who mostly didn’t advance the narrative.\n\nWhile I didn’t love this book quite as much as their first, I like what these authors have to offer. I’d recommend this book to Austen fans searching for a fairly faithful retelling of Pride and Prejudice.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nAudrey Bellezza is a two-time Emmy Award–nominated TV producer who has spent over twenty years writing, developing, and executive producing nonfiction television shows for a number of networks and streaming platforms.
