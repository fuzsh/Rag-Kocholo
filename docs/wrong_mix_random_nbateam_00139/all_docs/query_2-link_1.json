        "text": "Date Event Ref. 4 The NCAA and ESPN announce an eight-year deal, beginning September 1 and running through the 2031–32 academic year, that will see ESPN and its sister networks carry championship events in 21 women's and 19 men's sports across the three NCAA divisions, most notably continued coverage of the Division I women's basketball tournament. [1] 5 Nigel Lythgoe announces he has stepped down from his role on So You Think You Can Dance in the wake of two sexual misconduct lawsuits filed against him. Lythgoe, who has denied the accusations, co-created the Fox reality competition series in 2005, and had served as its executive producer and lead judge. [2] 7 Rather than stay with the network as a commentator and fill-in anchor, Medhi Hasan concludes the last episode of his self-titled MSNBC weekend show by stating he will depart the network entirely. The Medhi Hasan Show's cancellation was announced in November 2023 by MSNBC as part of a revamp of its weekend schedule that will take effect the weekend of January 13–14. [3][4] The 81st Golden Globe Awards aired on CBS and Paramount+, with notable winners including Best Motion Pictures Poor Things (Musical or Comedy) and Oppenheimer (Drama, among its five wins) and TV series Succession (Best Drama Series, among four wins in a night-leading nine nominations), The Bear (Best Musical or Comedy Series, among its three wins), and Beef (Best Limited Series, Anthology, or Film, among its three wins). The ceremony was hosted by Jo Koy, whose opening monologue was poorly received by guests and critics; Koy defended himself by saying he was hired only ten days prior after several other comedians reportedly declined to host. It also marks the ceremony's return to CBS after a 42-year absence (it previously aired on the network from 1981 to 1982); NBC had televised the Globes since 1996, aside from a one-year absence in 2022. [5][6]\n\n[7][8]\n\n[note 1] 9 The Oklahoma City Thunder reach an agreement with Griffin Media to air eight Friday night games from its remaining 2023–24 regular schedule sublicensed from longtime cable partner Bally Sports Oklahoma (per a clause in parent Diamond Sports Group's 2023–24 NBA contract that allows teams to offer a selection of over-the-air telecasts to local stations within their broadcast territory). The regional sports network will produce and employ its on-air staff for the telecasts (beginning with a January 26 away game against the New Orleans Pelicans), which will air on Griffin-owned MyNetworkTV affiliate KSBI/Oklahoma City (which previously aired Thunder games from 2008 to 2011) and local news subchannel KOTV-DT3/Tulsa. [9][10]\n\n[11][12]\n\n[note 2] 10 Two events featuring Republican Party hopefuls for president are concurrently telecast from Des Moines, Iowa: CNN hosts the fifth GOP debate of the campaign season featuring Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, while Fox News counterprograms with a town hall featuring nomination frontrunner Donald Trump, the former president's first live appearance on that network since 2022. [13][14] 13 The Miami Dolphins play the Kansas City Chiefs in an NFL Wild Card game. Peacock broadcasts the contest nationally, the first NFL playoff game to be carried exclusively on a streaming service (though NBC's Miami and Kansas City affiliates carry it locally to satisfy the league's local broadcast requirements). [15] 14 The 29th Critics' Choice Awards were held at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, with notable winners including films Oppenheimer and Barbie (with eight and six wins, respectively) and TV programs The Bear, Beef (with four wins each) and Succession (with three wins). Chelsea Handler hosted the ceremony on The CW, which used the broadcast to unveil a new brand identity that drops the \"The\" from its redefined logo (though \"The CW\" remains the network's name) and replaces its long-time green signature color with a red–orange \"hot sauce\" palette. [16][17] 15 The 75th Primetime Emmy Awards aired on Fox from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles with Anthony Anderson as host. Notable winners include The Bear and Succession (both with six major wins each, including Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Drama Series, respectively), and Beef (with five awards, including Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series). The ceremony was rescheduled from its original date of September 18, 2023 due to the Hollywood labor disputes. [18][19] 17 Diamond Sports Group, owner of the Bally Sports regional networks, announces a bankruptcy restructuring agreement—subject to court approval—that will see Amazon become a minority investor in the company (acquiring a 15% share, in exchange for a $115 million investment) and have Prime Video become its primary streaming partner. The Sinclair Broadcast Group subsidiary has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy since March 2023, and the deal will also see Sinclair make a $495 million cash payment to settle a lawsuit (filed in July 2023) alleging that Sinclair received about $1.5 billion in transactions that were designed to benefit itself while damaging Diamond's finances. [20] 23 World Wrestling Entertainment and Netflix announce a ten-year, $5 billion deal to carry WWE Raw in the United States and Canada beginning in January 2025, which will result in the end of the program's run on cable television after 31 years across two networks (USA Network from 1993 to 2000 and from 2005 to 2024, and Spike TV from 2000 to 2005). Under the same deal, Netflix will eventually gain global rights to Raw, and international rights to all other WWE programming, as existing contracts expire. [21][22] The Dallas Mavericks reach an agreement with Tegna-owned WFAA/Dallas–Fort Worth to air ten games from its remaining 2023–24 regular schedule sublicensed from Bally Sports Southwest (per a clause in Diamond Sports' NBA contract for the season, see January 9 entry), which will produce and employ its on-air staff for the telecasts. The package of Bally-produced games (which will begin with a March 1 away game against the Boston Celtics) joins three national ABC-televised games that were already slated to air on WFAA through April (including a January 24 home game against the Phoenix Suns). The Mavericks last televised their games over-the-air on CBS-owned KTXA from 2000 to 2021, when longtime cable home Bally Sports Southwest became their exclusive regional TV partner. [23][24]\n\n[note 3] 24 Comedy Central announces that Jon Stewart will return to The Daily Show as an executive producer and, through the 2024 U.S. election cycle, host on Monday nights (beginning February 12), with members of the show's correspondents roster anchoring the rest of the week. Stewart had served as the show's host from 1999 to 2015. [26] 28 The Milwaukee Bucks reach an agreement with Weigel Broadcasting to air a package of ten games from its remaining 2023–24 regular schedule on independent WMLW, along with regional simulcasts on stations throughout Wisconsin and in the Quad Cities, to be produced by Bally Sports Wisconsin under a sublicensing agreement. Two of the scheduled games will be simulcast on WMLW's Milwaukee-area sister stations: a February 23 away game against the Minnesota Timberwolves (the first of the slate) that will also air on co-owned CBS affiliate WDJT, and a March 4 home game against the Los Angeles Clippers that will be presented in Spanish on Telemundo affiliate WYTU. They will be the first local over-the-air Bucks telecasts since the team's 19-year relationship with WCGV ended in 2007. [27][28]\n\n[note 4] Date Event Ref. 1 Gray Television announces it reached an agreement to trade CBS/CW+ affiliate KGWN/Cheyenne, NBC/CW+ affiliate KCWY/Casper, Wyoming, and NBC affiliate KNEP/Scottsbluff, Nebraska (which concurrently shut down its news bureau, replaced in-house newscasts with simulcasts from KGWN/KCWY's Cheyenne-based Wyoming News Now operation, and laid off most of its Scottsbluff-based staff) to Marquee Broadcasting, in exchange for the latter group's construction permit for the proposed KCBU/Salt Lake City. Neither company will receive additional cash or other compensation as part of the transaction. [32][33]\n\n[34]\n\n[note 5] 2 Twelve Cox Media Group-owned stations in nine markets are dropped from DirecTV and co-owned DirecTV Stream and U-verse in a contract renewal impasse, resulting in the complete loss of satellite distribution for the group's stations. (Cox has been in a dispute with Dish Network since November 2022, resultng in the removal of those 12 stations, out of 13 operated by the group.) The Cox-owned stations were restored on February 11, in turn, averting subscriber blackouts of CBS's Super Bowl LVIII coverage in the Seattle and Dayton markets. [35][36]\n\n[37][38]\n\n[note 6] 4 The 66th Annual Grammy Awards aired on CBS and streamed on Paramount+ from the Crypto.com Arena, with Trevor Noah as host. Notable winners include Phoebe Bridgers (who received the most wins with four awards, including Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Ghost in the Machine\" alongside SZA), Taylor Swift (whose Album of the Year win for Midnights made her the first artist to win in that category four times), Miley Cyrus (who won Record of the Year for \"Flowers\"), siblings Billie Eilish and Finneas (jointly earning Song of the Year for \"What Was I Made For?\" from the Barbie film soundtrack), and Victoria Monét (the Best New Artist winner). [39][40]\n\n[41] 6 Actress Gina Carano sues The Walt Disney Company and co-owned Lucasfilm on claims she was wrongfully fired from The Mandalorian, seeking an order forcing the studio to rehire her or pay at least $75,000 in damages. Carano, who played Cara Dune during the Disney+ space Western's first two seasons, was fired in February 2021 after comparing the treatment of conservatives to the Nazi persecution of Jews in an Instagram post (one of several inflammatory social media posts of hers that were heavily criticized for their far-right viewpoints including remarks mocking COVID-19 masking mandates and the inclusion of gender pronouns in social media profiles, and falsely claiming voter fraud in the 2020 election). Carano, who received assistance from X/Twitter parent X Corp. to cover legal fees, claims Lucasfilm did not hold male co-stars to similar standards for controversial posts aimed at Republicans (including one by series lead Pedro Pascal from 2017, comparing then-President Donald Trump to Hitler), and subjected her to harassment and hurt her future work prospects. [42][43]\n\n[note 7] Five years after rejoining PBS, KCET/Los Angeles rebrands as \"PBS SoCal Plus\" to further connect it with sister station KOCE/Huntington Beach, which replaced KCET as the market's primary PBS member (and first adopted the \"PBS SoCal\" brand) in January 2011. The callsign and the programming remains the same. [46][47] 7 Actress Arianne Zucker sues former Days of Our Lives co-executive producer/director Albert Alarr, executive producer Ken Corday and production company Corday Productions, alleging she was discriminated and wrongfully fired after filing a complaint accusing Alarr of making unwanted sexual advances and touching her nonconsensually while working on the Peacock soap opera. Zucker—who played Nicole Walker over three stints since she was cast on the then-NBC serial in 1998—claims that, as retaliation for her involvement in Days distributor Sony Pictures Television's investigation into Alarr's conduct (which led to his August 2023 dismissal), she was written out of storylines and given a \"take it or leave it\" offer to renew her contract (which lapsed in January without renewal, with Zucker contending Corday Productions refused to negotiate in good faith) despite her veteran cast member status, along with having had her salary and travel budget cut. [48][49] The Federal Communications Commission issues a $720,000 fine against Nexstar Media Group in relation to a complaint filed in July 2023 by Hawaiian Telcom that the group violated FCC good faith carriage negotiation rules in their two-month dispute (which began the month prior) that blacked out Nexstar's KHON (Fox/CW)–KHII (MyNetworkTV)/Honolulu and NewsNation from the provider's systems. Hawaiian Telcom accused Nexstar of withholding consent by not responding to its request to extend negotiations by one week until immediately before the agreement expired, that Nexstar demanded an 80% increase in carriage fees, and that the group demanded Hawaiian Telcom rescind its FCC complaint and not file any against the company in the future. [50][51]\n\n[52][53]\n\n[note 8] 11 The NFL's Super Bowl LVIII, won by the Kansas City Chiefs (25–22, in overtime) over the San Francisco 49ers, airs on CBS from Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada. Univision airs Spanish-language coverage of the game (that network's first ever Super Bowl), while CBS sibling network Nickelodeon also airs a kid-oriented broadcast (the first alternate English-language telecast of a Super Bowl). The game becomes the most-watched television program in history, with an estimated 123.4 million viewers. [54][55]\n\n[56][57]\n\n[58] 12 The Cleveland Cavaliers reach an agreement with Gray Television to air a package of five games from its remaining 2023–24 regular schedule locally on CW affiliate WUAB and in Cincinnati on Fox affiliate WXIX, along with regional simulcasts on stations throughout the rest of Ohio and West Virginia's northern panhandle. The package, which will be produced by Bally Sports Ohio under a sublicensing agreement, will begin with a March 5 away game against the Boston Celtics and marks the first time Cavs games have been televised over-the-air since their previous 24-year relationship with WUAB ended in 2018, in favor of an exclusive agreement with longtime cable home Fox Sports Ohio (renamed in 2021 under the Bally Sports banner). [59][60]\n\n[note 9] During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Katy Perry announces that she would be leaving American Idol following its upcoming 22nd season (which premiered on February 18). Perry has been on the ABC talent competition's judge panel since its revival in 2018. [62] 13 NBC Sports California announces the hiring of Jenny Cavnar as primary play-by-play announcer for its Oakland Athletics telecasts, beginning with the upcoming 2024 Major League Baseball season. Cavnar, who spent the past 12 years as a pre- and post-game host and backup announcer for Colorado Rockies games, becomes the first woman in MLB history to call games on a regular basis. [63] 15 During a viewer submission segment on its 7:00 p.m. newscast, KGW/Portland, Oregon airs a photo—captioned \"Boy scouts in the 50s\" by the submitter—showing a racist slur (“hit the nigger baby”) on a banner for a fairground ball-throwing attraction. The Tegna-owned NBC affiliate issues an apology during its newscasts the next day, acknowledging their \"failure to uphold,\" and promising their reevaluation of, station standards regarding viewer-submitted content. [64][65]\n\n[note 10] 17 Former U.S. Representative George Santos sues Jimmy Kimmel for $750,000 on charges of copyright infringement, fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment after Kimmel purchased custom Cameo videos from Santos using fake names and aired them on his ABC late night show. [66] 18 The 49th People's Choice Awards air on NBC, E! and Peacock from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, with Simu Liu as host. Among television nominees, The Kardashians (Reality Show of the Year, and Khloé Kardashian for Reality TV Star of the Year), The Last of Us (Drama Show of the Year, and Pedro Pascal for Male TV Star of the Year) and Only Murders in the Building (Comedy Show of the Year, and Selena Gomez for Female TV Star of the Year) tied for the most wins, with two awards each, while Grey's Anatomy won the Show of the Year. Barbie had the most wins among all categories with five awards (including Movie of the Year, and respective wins by Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie for Male and Female Movie Star of the Year). Taylor Swift led the music categories with four awards (including Female Artist of the Year). Adam Sandler and Lenny Kravitz, respectively, were honored with the People's Icon Award and Music Icon Award. [67][68] 20 FuboTV files an antitrust lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company, Fox Corporation, and Warner Bros. Discovery over their proposed joint venture in which the respective owners of ESPN, Fox Sports, and TNT Sports plan to launch a sports-focused streaming service. FuboTV claims the service gives the broadcasters an unfair advantage over providers such as Fubo who are forced to carry less-desirable programming for access to sports. [69] 22 Sam Waterston makes his final appearance on Law & Order as Jack McCoy, as the character resigns as New York City District Attorney rather than face the political wrath of the mayor (for subpoenaing the mayor's son in a murder case) in the episode \"Last Dance.\" Waterston, who announced his departure from the series on February 2 (after appearing in over 400 episodes in 19 seasons across 30 years), will be succeeded by Tony Goldwyn as new DA Nicholas Baxter later in the current 23rd season. [70][71] 28 Tom Skilling retires from WGN-TV/Chicago, after nearly 46 years as meteorologist for the Nexstar-owned independent station. His final evening newscasts that day capped off a month-long tribute to Skilling, who earned reverence in the Chicago broadcasting and national meteorological communities during his tenure (the latter resulting from his weathercasts being televised over WGN's former superstation feed (now NewsNation) from 1978 to 2014) for the in-depth analysis and striking accuracy of his forecasts. Demetrius Ivory, who joined the station in 2013, succeeded Skilling as chief meteorologist on February 29. [72][73] Nexstar Media Group petitions the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to review changes to FCC broadcast ownership rules passed in December 2023 that closed loopholes allowing licensees to hold more than one Big Four affiliation in a market by placing certain networks on subchannels or low-power stations, and upheld a 1996 rule prohibiting broadcasters from owning stations that reach more than 39% of U.S. households in total. Nexstar asserts that the FCC overstepped its authority by tightening ownership rules despite competition to broadcast media by pay television and streaming, and claims the order had numerous procedural problems and faulty conclusions in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and the 1996 Telecommunications Act. [74][75]\n\n[note 11] Date Event Ref. 7 President Joe Biden delivers his third State of the Union address, airing along with associated coverage on all major broadcast and cable news networks. In the speech, Biden addressed issues such as the economy, democracy, abortion rights (directly addressing Supreme Court justices in an unscripted moment regarding the 2022 court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade), immigration (reiterating calls for House Republicans to pass bipartisan immigration legislation stalled under pressure from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and mentioning the February murder of Laken Riley in the context of border policy), the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Israel-Hamas War (advocating for a temporary ceasefire and two-state solution to the conflict, and demanding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu allow in humanitarian aid to Gaza civilians). The Republican response delivered by Alabama U.S. Senator Katie Britt, which primarily touched on immigration, drew largely negative reviews (including from Republicans), and was criticized for its inaccuracy (including a misrepresentation of the story of Karla Jacinto Romero, who was sold into sex trafficking while in Mexico during George W. Bush's presidency) and for Britt's stylistic delivery (described as \"dramatic\", \"creepy\", \"insincere\" and \"over-the-top\", and questioning her decision to conduct the response in her kitchen). The address drew 32.2 million viewers across nine networks, with Fox News registering the highest viewership at 5.640 million. [76][77]\n\n[78][79]\n\n[80][81]\n\n[82][83]\n\n[84] 10 The 96th Academy Awards air on ABC from the Dolby Theatre, with Jimmy Kimmel as host. Oppenheimer led all nominees in overall wins with seven awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Cillian Murphy), Best Supporting Actor (Robert Downey Jr.) and Best Director (Christopher Nolan). Other major winners included Poor Things with four awards, including Best Actress (Emma Stone); and The Zone of Interest with two, including Best International Feature Film. Billie Eilish and Finneas won Best Original Song (for \"What Was I Made For?\" from the Barbie film soundtrack), becoming the youngest two-time Oscar winners in history (at ages 22 and 26, respectively), having previously won the award in 2022. The telecast was watched by 19.5 million viewers, the highest viewership for any awards show since 2020. [85][86]\n\n[87][88]\n\n[89] 11 TNT Sports launches a nightly sports block on TruTV that features a mix of live sports events (including “alterna-casts”—specialized simulcasts targeting various audiences—of NHL, MLB and NBA games shown on TBS and TNT, NCAA men's basketball tournament coverage and MotoGP races); sports news and ancillary original programs (including the half-hour TNT Sports Update, sports betting program The Line, social media conversation show Handles, and a weekly program based on the social media clip showcase House of Highlights); and sports-focused movies and documentaries. Reruns of its original unscripted programs (including its last remaining non-sports original program, Impractical Jokers, which will consequently move its first-run episodes to TBS in the summer) will continue to air in the morning and daytime hours following the addition of the “TNT Sports on TruTV\" block. [90][91] 14 In a 3–2 party-line vote (backed solely by its Democratic commissioners), the Federal Communications Commission, as part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to curb hidden \"junk\" fees charged to customers, passes new rules requiring cable and satellite providers to disclose the total cost of their programming packages—including any additional programming-related fees, such as surcharges for receiving local stations and regional sports networks—in billing and promotional materials. The NCTA asserts that the rules, as written, would create confusion for customers and that providers already offer “clear and accurate pricing information” about their programming tiers. [92][93] 17 Three days after the FCC voted to require television providers to disclose \"all-in\" pricing (incorporating surcharges for receiving certain channels) and likely in response to recent carriage disputes with station operators, DirecTV introduces a \"No Locals\" option for its Entertainment, Choice, Ultimate and Premier programming tiers, allowing its satellite customers the ability to opt out of receiving local broadcast stations available in their home markets for a $12 monthly discount. (It joins rival satellite provider Dish Network, which has offered such opt-outs since 2017, in allowing customers to exclude local stations from their channel packages.) [94][95]\n\n[note 12] 18 Former U.S. president and 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sues ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for defamation, claiming the This Week moderator harmed his reputation by stating multiple times in a March 10 interview with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) that Trump had been found civilly liable for raping former Vogue advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, stems from Stephanopoulos' questioning of Mace, a rape survivor, about her continued support of Trump despite two recent jury verdicts in related civil battery and defamation suits that found he sexually abused Carroll, who has been awarded $88.3 million in damages, in 1995/96. (Mace accused Stephanopoulos of trying to “shame” her by probing why she endorsed Trump for president.) While the jury in the initial 2023 civil defamation case technically found Trump liable for sexually assaulting and defaming Carroll, Judge Lewis Kaplan later clarified that they found that Trump raped her by forcible digital penetration (defined as sexual assault under New York's penal code), concluding her allegation of rape was “substantially true\" in the broader context beyond the state's legal definition. [96][97]\n\n[98] 19 Bellator MMA announces a distribution deal with Warner Bros. Discovery that will see Max acquire streaming rights to the promotion's mixed martial arts events (including its eight 2024 Champions Series fights, starting with Bellator 302 on March 22), archival fight cards (dating to Bellator's 2008 inception) and original docuseries, along with additional fights and ancillary content on TruTV. The WBD deal replaces a previous agreement with former owner Paramount Global, which acquired the promotion in 2011 (as Viacom) and sold it to the Professional Fighters League in 2023. (Outside of a 2019–20 deal with DAZN, Bellator matches aired on multiple Paramount/Viacom-owned networks during that timeframe, last airing on Showtime from 2021 to 2023, with that deal ending as a result of Paramount shuttering the premium channel's sports division.) [99][100]\n\n[note 13] 20 The College Football Playoff announces a six-year deal with ESPN (worth an estimated $7.8 billion overall) that will see the network retain broadcast rights to the College Football Playoff through the 2020–31 academic year, and will transfer the CFP National Championship game from ESPN to sister network ABC (which carried the predecessor BCS National Championship Game from 1999 to 2006) starting in 2026. The agreement also modifies terms of the remaining two years of ESPN's initial contract for the CFP television rights (a 12-year deal that was signed in 2014) to account for the tournament's expansion from four to 12 teams, starting with the 2024–25 college football season, and allows for ESPN to sublicense a select number of CFP games to other networks. [101][102] 21 The FCC fines Nexstar Media Group and partner company Mission Broadcasting a combined $1.82 million, and orders the latter to sell WPIX/New York City, ruling that Nexstar unlawfully circumvented national broadcast ownership limits through a local marketing agreement it signed in December 2020, as part of an option that Mission exercised to buy the CW affiliate from the E. W. Scripps Company, that resulted in “an unauthorized transfer of control” of WPIX to Nexstar through certain attributable interests. (The FCC limits a single company from owning television stations that reach a combined 39% of American TV households, thus requiring Nexstar—which maintains similar operational arrangements with Mission in 26 other markets—to sell other stations in its portfolio in order to acquire WPIX while complying with the cap). Its first sale proposal to meet the cap would be disclosed on April 12, as it proposed to sell MyNetworkTV affiliate WJMN/Escanaba, Michigan (a former semi-satellite of co-owned WFRV/Green Bay that lost its CBS affiliation in 2022 in a chain-wide affiliation renewal dispute with the network) to a former Quincy Media executive who would enter into an LMA with Morgan Murphy Media, the new owners of ABC/CW affiliate WBUP/WBKP in the same market. [103][104]\n\n[105]\n\n[note 14] 22 NBC News announces that Ronna McDaniel will join the network as a contributor for its political and Election Night coverage. The hiring of McDaniel—who, on March 8, ended her seven-year term as Republican National Committee chair, a role in which she frequently echoed Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged in Joe Biden's favor and helped organize fake electors in key battleground states in an attempt to overturn the outcome—was met with furor within the news division including on-air denouncements from MSNBC's hosts and analysts. MSNBC president Rashida Jones, responding to staff backlash, announced on March 23 that McDaniel would not appear on its programs. McDaniel, for her part, used a March 24 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press (which was scheduled and recorded before her hiring by the network) to state that Biden won fairly and disagrees with Trump's desire to pardon the January 6 rioters. NBC parted ways with McDaniel on March 26, citing a lack of consensus in support of her hiring. [106][107]\n\n[108][109]\n\n[110][111] 25 CBS announces a linear–streaming rights deal with Dick Clark Productions that extends its contract for the Golden Globe Awards (initially a one-year deal for the 2024 edition) through 2030, and grants it telecast rights to the American Music Awards for an unspecified term, starting with the 2024 ceremony. (Both award shows will also be streamed live on Paramount+.) The deal ends the AMAs' 51-year broadcast relationship with ABC, for which Clark created the ceremony in 1973 following the expiration of the network's deal to televise the Grammy Awards, which moved to longtime broadcaster CBS that same year. (ABC last televised the AMAs in 2022; no ceremony was held in 2023.) [112][113] 28 The Detroit Pistons reach an agreement with the E. W. Scripps Company to air a package of five games (out of the team's eight remaining regular season games scheduled for April) from its 2023–24 schedule locally on CW affiliate WMYD. The package, which will be produced by longtime cable carrier Bally Sports Detroit (which will simulcast the games outside of the Detroit market) under a sublicensing agreement with Scripps Sports, will begin with an April 1 home game against the Memphis Grizzlies. It marks the first time that Pistons games have been televised over-the-air since their previous four-year relationship with WMYD and Graham-owned NBC affiliate WDIV ended in 2008, in favor of an exclusive deal with the network then known as Fox Sports Detroit. [114][115]\n\n[note 15] 29 NFL Network's Good Morning Football broadcasts its final show from New York City before going on hiatus and relocating to the NFL Media facility in Inglewood, California before the 2024 NFL season. Plans are also in the works to offer a two-hour extension of the program in broadcast syndication via Sony Pictures Television upon its move. [116] 30 The United Football League airs its inaugural game on Fox, a 27-14 win by the Birmingham Stallions over the host Arlington Renegades. The teams were champions of the leagues that merged to form the UFL on December 31, 2023, the USFL (of which the Stallions were two-time champs) and the XFL (the Renegades won that league's 2023 title). [117][118] Date Event Ref. 1–7 The final week of the 2024 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament sees three viewership records for women's basketball being set: On April 1, ESPN's broadcast of a regional final between Iowa Hawkeyes over the LSU Tigers (a 94–87 win by the Hawkeyes propelled by a 41-point performance from Hawkeye star Caitlin Clark) attracts 12.3 million viewers, surpassing the 9.9 million who watched those two schools play in the 2023 national championship. On April 5, a 71–69 national semifinal win by the Hawkeyes over UConn attracts 14.2 million to ESPN, a record for any basketball game (college or pro, men or women) on the network. Then on April 7, the tournament's title game, an 87–75 win by undefeated South Carolina over the Hawkeyes, attracts 18.9 million total viewers on ABC and ESPN (the latter channel carried a Sue Bird/Diana Taurasi-hosted alternate telecast); it's the most-watched sporting event, outside of football and the Olympics, since 2019. [119][120]\n\n[121][122] 6–7 WWE's WrestleMania XL takes place at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, airing on Peacock and pay-per-view. [123] 7 The 2024 CMT Music Awards, hosted by Kelsea Ballerini, aired on CBS and streamed on Paramount+ from the Moody Center in Austin, Texas. Notable winners include Jelly Roll (who received the most wins with three awards, Video of the Year, Male Video of the Year and Performance of the Year, for \"Need a Favor\"), Lainey Wilson (who won Female Video of the Year for \"Watermelon Moonshine\") and Dan + Shay (who won Duo/Group Video of the Year for \"Save Me the Trouble\"). Trisha Yearwood received the inaugural June Carter Cash Humanitarian Award, recognizing artists, duos/groups or industry veterans who \"demonstrate an exceptional dedication to the community and their fellow artists.\" [124][125]\n\n[126] 8 TBS' and TNT's simulcast of the NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game, a 75–60 win by the UConn Huskies over the Purdue Boilermakers, attracts 14.82 million viewers. When compared to the women's DI title game (see 4/1–4/7 entry), it is the first time the women's championship game draws a bigger TV audience than the men's. [127] 10 A fire during a cooking segment on the set of Tamron Hall (which utilizes a temporary kitchen island with cooktop that is setup center stage for those segments) forces an evacuation of the show's studio at ABC's Broadcast Center in New York's Lincoln Square, with The View, which records in an adjacent studio, also seeing its studio evacuated as a precautionary measure. Although the New York Fire Department cleared The View to go live after the fire was put out, Tamron canceled the day's episode and substituted a rerun to its carrier stations. [128] 14 As Billy Joel is performing his signature song \"Piano Man\" during a CBS broadcast of the 100th concert in his Madison Square Garden residency, affiliates in the Eastern and Central time zones cut away to begin their late local news. Responding to outrage from viewers, CBS blamed the abrupt ending on a \"timing error\" (the special had been delayed 30 minutes due to final round coverage of the Masters Tournament) and announced it would re-air the program in its entirety on April 19. [129] 19 One day after the NHL Board of Governors announced the establishment of a Utah-based franchise in Salt Lake City (through the acquisition of assets from the deactivated Arizona Coyotes assigned to Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith), the team reaches a multi-year agreement with Scripps Sports to air their regionally televised hockey games on independent KUPX/Provo once the team begins play in the 2024–25 season. The Coyotes had been airing on KUPX under a regional simulcast arrangement with Phoenix sister KASW—which will continue to air the team's games post-relocation in a flip of the arrangement—since that station replaced the defunct Bally Sports Arizona as the team's local television carrier at the start of the 2023–24 season. [130][131] 22 One week after the moribund franchise selected former Iowa point guard Caitlin Clark as the first pick in the first round of the 2024 WNBA Draft, the Indiana Fever reach an agreement with Tegna to air a package of 17 regionally televised WNBA games on NBC affiliate WTHR and MeTV affiliate WALV-CD, beginning with the team's 2024 season. The deal begins with the team's home opener against the New York Liberty on May 16, and will see ten of the games being carried on WTHR, while seven others will air on WALV (which is simulcast on WTHR's DT3 subchannel). [132]\n\n[note 16] 25 The Seattle Kraken reach a multi-year agreement with Tegna to air their regionally televised games on independent station KONG, along with simulcasts of selected games on sister NBC affiliate KING, beginning with the NHL team's 2024–25 season. The deal—which replaces the team's previous television partnership with regional sports network Root Sports Northwest, which has carried the Kraken since the expansion franchise began play in 2021—would also see fellow Tegna stations KGW/Portland and KREM/Spokane simulcast the games across the team's regional territory, and KING/KONG carry team-related programs. Additionally, all Kraken games will be streamed on Amazon Prime Video in the Krakens' home market. [134] The CW announces a three-year deal with the Miss Universe Organization that extends its contract for the Miss USA pageant (initially a one-year deal for the 2023 edition), and grants it linear telecast rights to Miss Teen USA, starting with the 2024 ceremony. (Miss Teen USA—which will have its 42nd edition air on The CW on August 1, three days before the network's telecast of the 73rd Miss USA Pageant—had last aired on linear television in 2007, when the Miss Universe Organization ended a broadcast deal with NBC for the pageant separate from its contracts for Miss USA and Miss Universe, and was livestreamed on various platforms thereafter.) [135] 29 WBKB-TV, the only commercial broadcast station in Alpena, Michigan (the nation's third-smallest TV market) and carrier of four of the five major commercial TV networks, begins a news partnership with Sinclair's NBC affiliate, WPBN-TV/WTOM-TV in Traverse City, Michigan, to feature a full complement of newscasts and weather coverage blended with WBKB-TV's existing news operation, which will become a de facto bureau for WPBN/WTOM, known on-air as UpNorthLive News. WBKB, which had been acquired by Morgan Murphy Media in late 2023 after the death of its former owner, had struggled to maintain a full-time news and weather staff because of its market position and ownership in an era of media consolidation, mainly featuring a team staffed by recent college graduates, and also had issues maintaining full-time weather coverage, contracting short-term with freelance meteorologists and NewsNet to provide forecasts. WBKB will still produce some newscasts, with its NBC subchannel carrying all UpNorthLive newscasts, and its CBS and ABC channels carrying other simulcasts depending on their own schedules. WBKB's Fox schedule will continue to feature no news programming. [136] Date Event Ref. 1 Comcast removes 18 Bally Sports regional networks from Xfinity systems throughout their overlapping footprints, in a carriage dispute between the cable provider and Bally parent Diamond Sports Group, immediately affecting fans of 11 of the 12 Major League Baseball teams to which Bally Sports holds broadcast rights. The dispute injects uncertainty in Diamond's efforts to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy before the end of the year, as it had hoped to secure a deal with Comcast ahead of a June confirmation hearing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The dispute comes after Diamond Sports secured critical multi-year deals with two other major providers: Charter Spectrum (on April 4) and DirecTV (on April 24). [137][138] 2 Allen Media Group announces the layoffs of up to around 300 employees across its various operating divisions (including The Weather Channel, TheGrio and the company's television stations), affecting 12% of its workforce, as part of a broader effort to reduce operational costs to drive growth. Among those affected was veteran Weather Channel correspondent Mike Seidel, who joined the network as an on-camera meteorologist in 1992 and transitioned exclusively to field reporting in 2012. [139] 5 In a memo to ABC News staffers, Kim Godwin announces she will be leaving her role as president of the network's news division, a job she had held since 2021. Debra O'Connell, the president of News Group and Networks at ABC parent Disney Entertainment (and to whom Godwin had been reporting to since February), will lead ABC News on an interim basis until a successor for Godwin is hired. [140][141] 13 Major League Baseball and Roku, Inc. announce an agreement to air the MLB Sunday Leadoff package of early Sunday afternoon games on The Roku Channel. The package had aired the past two seasons on Peacock. [142] 14 The Pac-12 Conference announces an agreement with CW Sports and Fox Sports to air college football games involving the conference's two remaining schools, Oregon State and Washington State. Fox or FS1 will air one game for each school, while The CW will carry the rest. [143] 15 Netflix announces it has secured broadcast rights to National Football League Christmas Day games in a three-year deal that will see the streamer carry two games in 2024 and at least one game in both 2025 and 2026. [144] 16 The 59th Academy of Country Music Awards streams live on Amazon Prime Video from Ford Center at The Star with Reba McEntire as host. [145] 22 Mission Broadcasting notifies Adell Broadcasting, owner of WADL/Mount Clemens, Michigan, that it will terminate its plan to purchase Detroit's MyNetworkTV affiliate. First announced in May 2023, the deal would have seen WADL operated by longtime Mission partner Nexstar Media Group and affiliate with Nexstar-owned The CW (which the station previously carried from September to October 2023, before Adell terminated the brokered affiliation agreement in an LMA dispute with Mission/Nexstar). Though the FCC approved Mission's purchase on April 24, Mission withdrew the plan citing FCC-imposed restrictions that would have prevented financial backing from Nexstar from going towards Mission's purchase of WADL, limiting the amount of Nexstar-distributed programming it carried each week (likely constraining the station from carrying the full CW schedule), and prohibiting any option for Nexstar to acquire the station from Mission outright. [146][147] TNT Sports announces a five-year sublicensing agreement with ESPN that will see TNT, beginning in December, carry two first-round games in the expanded College Football Playoff (of which ESPN has the rights), with two quarterfinal games being added beginning in 2026. [148] Date Event Ref. 1 NewsNation formally adopts a 24/7 news format by expanding its weekend news coverage, replacing a three-hour block of Blue Bloods reruns with an extension of the daytime news program NewsNation Now. The Nexstar-owned cable channel that was once known as WGN America began weeknight news programming in September 2020 and expanded to a 24-hour all-news schedule on weekdays in April 2023, but while early-morning and prime-time news/analysis shows populated its weekend lineup, its weekend afternoon schedule had still featured entertainment programming acquired during the WGN era (notably off-network reruns like Blue Bloods). [149][150] 3 In discussing the WNBA on his eponymous ESPN program, former National Football League punter Pat McAfee refers to Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark as a \"white bitch\" who is ultimately responsible for the increased popularity in the league. After receiving criticism from sports commentators including ESPN colleagues like Kim Adams and Alexa Philippou, McAfee issued apologies to Clark personally as well as the public, stating \"I have way too much respect for her and women to put that into the universe.\" [151] 6 Fifty eight years to the day after he began his professional broadcasting career at the station, Don Alhart retires from WHAM-TV/Rochester, NY, signing off after having served as a reporter, main news anchor, and associate news director for the Deerfield Media-owned/Sinclair-operated ABC affiliate. [152] 7 The 51st Daytime Emmy Awards airs on CBS and streamed on Paramount+ from the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. [153] The last episode of Wheel of Fortune with Pat Sajak as host airs. Sajak had hosted the show since 1981, the longest tenured game show host in U.S. history. [154] 11 Confirming earlier reports, TNT Sports announces it has secured U.S. broadcast rights to the French Open tennis tournament for a 10-year period beginning in 2025, with matches being carried across TNT, TBS, TruTV, and the Max streaming service. The deal means NBC's relationship with the French Open ended with its broadcast of the men's singles championship on June 9; the network had broadcast the tournament each year since 1975 (save for a three-year period in the early 1980s when it aired on CBS). [155][156] 13 Fox Sports announces it has reached a deal with IndyCar to become the open-wheel racing circuit's exclusive TV partner beginning in 2025, supplanting NBC Sports in the role. The deal will see the full IndyCar Series schedule (including its crown jewel, the Indianapolis 500) airing on Fox, with qualifying rounds (save for the Indy 500's, which Fox will also carry) and the second-tier Indy NXT races airing on FS1 or FS2. [157] 16 The 77th Tony Awards airs on CBS and streams on Paramount+ from the David H. Koch Theater with Ariana DeBose as host, with its technical awards airing before the show on a Pluto TV pop-up channel. [158][159]\n\n[160] 27 The National Football League is ordered to pay more than $4.7 billion in damages after a federal jury in Los Angeles found the league had violated antitrust law in setting the price on its NFL Sunday Ticket package for games not selected for broadcast in a television market. The lawsuit covers more than 2.4 million customers who subscribed to the service from 2011 to 2022 via DirecTV, which at the time had been the exclusive provider of NFL Sunday Ticket. The league indicated it would appeal the ruling if the judge does not set it aside. [161] The first presidential debate occurs earlier than the three dates previously planned by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The event is hosted by CNN out of its studios in Atlanta, Georgia, without an audience present. [162] Network/\n\nservice Type Launch date Notes Sources The365 OTA multicast and OTT streaming January 1 On November 7, 2023, Katz Broadcasting founder Jonathan Katz and his new firm, Free TV Networks, unveiled two new OTA and FAST networks. The365, which is aimed at African-American viewers, and Outlaw, which consists mainly of classic western films, respectively competes with the similarly-themed Bounce TV and Grit, two multicast networks Katz's previous company founded and later sold in 2017 to the E. W. Scripps Company. Content for The365 and Outlaw initially comes from the libraries of Warner Bros. Discovery and Lionsgate, while Gray Television was the primary launch group for over-the-air distribution of the two networks (all three companies jointly operate Free TV Networks). [622] Outlaw Merit Street OTA multicast, OTT streaming, and cable/satellite April 2\n\n[note 17] On November 6, 2023, Dr. Phil McGraw announced plans to a new \"news and entertainment\" network named Merit Street Media (later shortened to Merit Street to differentiate from its parent company) in early 2024, which will be headquartered from an office and production facility based in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. The network maintains a general entertainment format (featuring a mix of news, talk shows, unscripted series and weekend evening movie presentations), with programs that include a nightly show hosted by McGraw himself focused around the advice format he provided on his 2002–23 syndicated talk show. Joel Cheatwood, a former news director known for driving the local news operations he oversaw in the 1990s and 2000s towards sensationalism (most notably, Sunbeam Television stations WSVN/Miami and WHDH/Boston), serves as the network's CEO. Distribution of the network is handled by the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and is available on the religious broadcaster's owned-and-operated stations (on the DT2 subchannel previously occupied by TBN Inspire), on cable, satellite, and free AVOD streaming platforms. TBN also contracted with full-power stations in New York City (WMBC) and Los Angeles (KVMD) to carry Merit Street on their primary channels in order to assure must-carry coverage of the network on pay television providers in those markets. [624][625]\n\n[note 18] The Network AVOD OTT streaming April 30 On March 19, The Network, an ad-supported premium streaming platform founded by film director Aram Rappaport (founder of creative advertising agency The Boathouse) with financial backing from BH Media Holdings, announced plans to launch on April 30. The Network's content strategy—premised on seeking to “declutter the streaming experience, eliminating audiences’ endless scrolling to find appealing series and films”—will expand its content gradually, releasing two original series at a time, with dramas debuting on Tuesdays and comedies debuting on Thursdays; the service's slate will initially launch with the thriller/sci-fi drama The Green Veil and British comedy Chivalry (the latter acquired from Channel 4). [626][627] ZipWave TV OTT streaming June On March 24, ZipWave LLC, a Wyoming-based technology company, announced the launch of its live OTT service ZipWave TV. Its lineup will consist of live news, entertainment and religious programming. Some of the networks it plans to offer at launch include Newsmax and FETV. [628][629] MeTV Toons OTA multicast June 25 On May 1, Weigel Broadcasting announced the pending launch of MeTV Toons, an expansion of its existing programming deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to carry select animated programming from that company's library on its main channel MeTV. The new channel, which will combine Warner Bros. Discovery archival cartoons with licensed programming from other providers, will air primarily on digital subchannels, with a free ad-supported streaming version with limited programming also being made available for Internet viewing. The programming would effectively replicate the format which Warner Bros. Discovery and its predecessors had offered on the Boomerang cable network for the previous 24 years. [630] Defy (Free TV Networks version) OTA multicast and OTT streaming July 1 On April 3, Free TV Networks announced the pending launch of Dare, an over-the-air subchannel and AVOD streaming network focusing on unscripted reality and documentary programming (including series such as American Pickers, Storage Wars, Pawn Stars, Alone, Swamp People, Counting Cars and Ax Men, among others). The network draws from the same A+E Networks reality library as Scripps Networks's Defy TV (both were developed by Free TV CEO Jonathan Katz, with Defy being created during his 2017–22 executive tenure at Scripps). Free TV Networks announced on July 1 that it had acquired the existing Defy TV trademarks from Scripps, allowing the network to launch on that date under the existing branding (although excising “TV” from the name), accompanied by much of the original network’s programming lineup, under new ownership. [631][632]\n\n[633] Venu Sports OTT streaming Fall (TBD) On February 6, ESPN Inc., Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery announced plans to launch a sports-focused streaming service, set for a Fall launch, that would feature live feeds from their respective linear sports and broadcast networks (including ESPN, ABC and the former's sister networks such as ESPN2 and SEC Network; Fox and sister networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network; and WBD-owned TNT, TBS and truTV), and streaming content from ESPN+, the major sports leagues (including the NBA, NHL, NFL and Major League Baseball) and college sports conferences. The service, which will also be optionally bundled with Disney+, Hulu or Max, will reportedly not impact ESPN's own plans to launch a full direct-to-consumer streaming service, which the company confirmed the following day would launch in the Fall of 2025. [634][635]\n\n[636][637] Old network\n\nname New network\n\nname Type Conversion date Notes Source Showtime (main linear channel) Paramount+ with Showtime Cable/satellite January 8 On January 30, 2023, Paramount Global announced plans to rebrand the linear Showtime service and fully integrate its direct-to-consumer streaming service with the premium tier of co-owned Paramount+; the combined service would be branded as Paramount+ with Showtime, which had already been in use for a streaming bundle that launched in August 2022. Paramount began directing prospective Showtime streaming customers to subscribe to the ad-free Paramount+ tier on June 27, 2023; it would later discontinue the Showtime Anytime TV Everywhere app (offered to subscribers of the linear Showtime service) on December 14, and the standalone Showtime streaming service on December 31; the primary Showtime channel was renamed Paramount+ with Showtime on January 8, 2024, although the standalone Showtime nameplate remains in use as the branding for its seven multiplex channels and as a marketing imprint for the network's original programming. Paramount Global initially stated it had no plans to offer complimentary provider login access to Paramount+'s Showtime tier to subscribers of the premium channel's linear package (in contrast to the arrangement involving Warner Bros. Discovery-owned Max, which has been available free to linear HBO subscribers—replacing the HBO Go TV Everywhere platform—since the service launched in May 2020); however it would change course beginning on January 9, reaching deals with DirecTV (including co-owned DirecTV Stream and U-verse), Hulu and Charter Spectrum to offer the network's linear/VOD subscribers complimentary access to the namesake Paramount+ tier starting later in the year. [638][639]\n\n[640][641]\n\n[642] Hallmark Drama Hallmark Family Cable/satellite February 28 On February 5, during the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour, Hallmark Media announced plans to rebrand Hallmark Drama as Hallmark Family on February 28, and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries as Hallmark Mystery on March 6. The changes effectively serve to clarify both networks' existing programming formats—the former centering around family- and faith-oriented programming, and the latter centering around mystery programs—both of which offer acquired series, and original (in the case of Hallmark Movies & Mysteries/Hallmark Mystery) and library (primarily sourced from Hallmark Channel) movies and mini-series. [643][644] Hallmark Movies & Mysteries Hallmark Mystery March 6 CBS News (streaming) CBS News 24/7 OTT streaming April 22 On April 9, Variety reported streaming offerings in recent that the CBS News streaming network would rebrand on April 22 as CBS News 24/7, as part of a broader expansion of its programming to include a new eponymous “whip-around” news program that will rely on reports sourced from the national CBS News division and local CBS stations, expansions of the political news show America Decides (from 30 minutes to an hour) and Primetime with John Dickerson (from one hour to 90 minutes, along with a name change to The Daily Report with John Dickerson), and the addition of the late night newscast CBS News Roundup. [645] Defy TV (Scripps version) Ion Plus (resumption of over-the-air multicast distribution) OTA multicast and OTT streaming July 1 On June 17, Scripps Networks disclosed on the social media profiles of Defy TV and Ion Plus that the latter network, which had transitioned an over-the-air multicast network to a free ad-supported streaming channel in February 2021 after Scripps's acquisition of Ion Media, would resume over-the-air clearance on Ion's stations (and other third-party affiliates) over the channel space occupied by Defy TV, which struggled to attain any long-term viewer sustainability with its 2010s-era reality/unscripted format mainly drawn from the A&E Networks library (this same issue had earlier resulted in Scripps merging the programming of female-targeted sister network TrueReal—which had its channel space subsequently leased over to Jewelry Television—into the male-focused Defy's schedule in March 2023). Ion Plus's existing schedule of procedural dramas will continue over-the-air with newer and higher-profile acquisitions (along with Canadian series and selected 1990s–2000s first-run syndicated dramas) airing as part of its schedule, and its existing AVOD availability wholly unaffected. Defy was then relaunched under the auspices of Free TV Networks at the same time (as detailed above, in the \"Launches\" section). [646] Network/\n\nservice Type End date Notes Source Viaplay (U.S. service) OTT streaming February 29 On July 20, 2023, Viaplay Group announced that it would discontinue its Viaplay streaming services in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom (the former having launched just six months prior on February 22), and immediately ceased marketing to new subscribers in those regions. The move was part of a refocusing on its core markets of Scandinavia and the Netherlands, centering on its sports offering and the sale of non-sports content through its Viaplay Select business; about 25% of the company's staff were laid off as a result. On January 18, Viaplay confirmed that its U.S. service would shut down on February 29, and would refund monthly and annual subscribers for the remaining time of their subscription. Viaplay content will remain available in the U.S. through The Roku Channel, Xfinity (via its X1 and Flex tiers) and Xumo. [647][648]\n\n[649] MotorTrend+ March 28 On February 23, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it would be shutting down MotorTrend+ at the end of March. Subscribers will be migrated to the ad-free tier of Discovery+, while its programming library will be moved over to both Discovery+ and Max in stages until the service's closure. [650] TV Japan Cable/satellite March 31 On February 17, TV Japan announced on its website that the NHK Cosmomedia America-owned network (which aired news and entertainment programs sourced from various broadcasters based in Japan, primarily from public broadcaster NHK as well as commercial networks such as Tokyo Broadcasting System Television, Nippon TV, TV Tokyo, Fuji Television and TV Asahi) would cease distribution on cable and satellite providers on March 31; much of its programming migrated to NHK's new streaming service Jme [jp], which soft-launched ten days before and features a broader selection of programming than the schedule-limited wireline TV Japan channel and is priced comparably at $25/month. [651] Funimation OTT streaming April 2 On February 7, Sony announced that the Funimation app and website would shut down on April 2, and that users would be able to migrate their account data to Crunchyroll until then. [652][653] Showtime (streaming service) April 30 On January 30, 2023, Paramount announced plans to fully integrate the Showtime direct-to-consumer streaming service with the premium tier of the Paramount+ streaming service; the streaming tier rebrand replaces a bundle of the same name that launched in mid-2022. The cable-specific Showtime Anytime app was shut down by the end of the year. On April 11, 2024, Paramount announced that the standalone app would shut down on April 30. [654][655]\n\n[656] Longhorn Network Cable/satellite June 30 With the Texas Longhorns joining the Southeastern Conference, the standalone Longhorn Network, a channel devoted to the athletics program of the University of Texas at Austin, was discontinued as its programming was merged into the SEC Network. A free ad-supported streaming television version of the Longhorn Network was launched July 1, in partnership with Learfield Sports instead of previous partner ESPN. [657] Pac-12 Network With the departure of all but two of the Pac-12 Conference's teams to other conferences for the 2024–25 season, the Pac-12 Network was discontinued. [658] Noggin OTT streaming July 2 On February 15, as part of a series of layoffs affecting 800 employees (or about 3% of its workforce), Paramount Global announced that it would shut down the Noggin subscription streaming service (which was launched in 2015 and is marketed to children ages two to seven), resulting in the termination of its entire staff. Much of the long-form and short-form content featured on the service will be shifted over to Paramount+'s Nick Jr. section (which already carries much of Nick Jr.'s library of preschool programming). Noggin would subsequently stop accepting new subscribers, while existing subscribers would be transitioned over to Paramount+ prior to the former's shutdown. This marks the second discontinuation of the Noggin edutainment brand by Paramount: it originally launched in February 1999 as a linear cable spinoff of Nickelodeon, aimed at preteens and teenagers, under a joint venture between predecessor company Viacom and Sesame Workshop; the Noggin network shifted its target audience to preschoolers in 2007 (after the teen-targeted nighttime block The N was spun off as a separate network, since renamed TeenNick, occupying Nickelodeon GaS's former channel space), and was later relaunched as Nick Jr. Channel in September 2009.
