        "text": "Filipino volleyball player (born 1993)\n\nIn this Philippine name, the middle name or maternal family name is Caymo and the surname or paternal family name is Valdez.\n\nAlyssa Caymo Valdez (Tagalog: [ɐˈlɐjsa bɐlˈdɛs]; born June 29, 1993) is a Filipino volleyball player who currently plays for the Creamline Cool Smashers. She was a member of the collegiate varsity women's volleyball team of Ateneo de Manila University in both indoor and beach volleyball. She was most outstanding as an indoor volleyball player where she brought multiple championship titles and a lot of honor for the university. She is a current member of Philippines national team. Her global recognition paved the way for her to play in other countries like Thailand for 3BB Nakornnont and Taiwan for Attack Line Volleyball Club.\n\nValdez was raised in San Juan, Batangas, to parents Ruel, who works in an automobile company, and Pablita, a public school teacher. She is the only daughter among four children.[1] She learned how to play volleyball by playing with her two older brothers when she was in elementary school at the age of 12.[1]\n\nHaving developed her volleyball skills, she was chosen to play in the Southern Tagalog Calabarzon Athletic Association (STCAA),[2] a regional sports meet for elementary and high school student athletes in the Calabarzon[3] region where she was scouted and recruited by the University of Santo Tomas (UST) to play for their high school varsity volleyball team, the UST Tigress Cubs.[4]\n\nIn her first year at the University of Santo Tomas Junior High School, she was selected as a member of the National Capital Region (NCR) team for the Palarong Pambansa, a national sports competition for elementary and secondary students. She was UST's top high school volleyball player who led her team to several championships: three titles in UAAP (Seasons 70–72), and one in National Shakey's Girls' Volleyball League (2009). She was a three-time MVP in UAAP (Season 70–72) and once in Shakey's Girls' Volleyball League (2009).[5]\n\nValdéz's student-athlete career reached a higher level during her college years. She garnered multiple individual awards and helped win a couple of championship titles for her college team, Ateneo Lady Eagles. She was UAAP's 4-time Best Scorer, 3-time Best Server, 3-time Season MVP, and one-time Finals MVP.\n\nThough enrolled as a freshman student in Ateneo, Valdéz had to serve a one-year residency imposed by the University Athletic Association of the Philippines for transferring from a UAAP school (UST) to another (Ateneo).[6] During this time, she competed in the International Federal Beach Volleyball Tournament held in China together with Lady Eagle teammate Bea Tan where they finished 7th.[7] She also played as a guest player for Ateneo in two conferences of Shakey's V-League.\n\nThe Shakey's V-League Season 7 2nd Conference marked her first game appearance with the Lady Eagles in a tournament, as a guest player. This time, she was not yet part of the 1st six. The following Season (Shakey's V-League Season 8 1st Conference), she joined the team again as a guest player and this time as a starter. Valdez won her first V-League gold medal after they beat the defending champions, the Adamson Lady Falcons, in the finals.[8]\n\nThe first ever Open Conference of Shakey's V-League was the first tournament where Valdéz played as a regular player for Ateneo. She was one of the top scorers of the team. The Lady Eagles was the only collegiate team to enter the Final 4 and finished in 3rd place.[9]\n\nThe Lady Eagles joined the 3rd season of Shakey's V-League Season 8 which was the Southeast Asian Club Invitational League. Valdez led the Lady Eagles in beating the club team from Malaysia in the eliminations. She had 27 points in that game.[10]\n\nAfter serving the mandatory one-year residency rule, thus making her ineligible for the UAAP Rookie of the Year award, Valdez made it to the Lady Eagles roster in UAAP Season 74 and joined the veteran players Fille Cainglet, Dzi Gervacio, Gretchen Ho, A Nacachi, and Jem Ferrer or collectively known as the Fab 5. She contributed to the team's offense and helped bring the team to the Finals.[11] Ateneo took Game number 1 of the Finals but failed to beat the DLSU Lady Spikers in the next 2 games. In beach volleyball, together with Bea Tan and Fille Cainglet, they finished 2nd place.[12]\n\nIn the 1st Conference of Shakey's V-League Season 9, she received her second V-League gold medal and was named the Finals MVP after they defended their title against the UST Tigresses.[13]\n\nIn the Open Conference of Shakey's V-League Season 9, Valdez led the Ateneo team and again, they are the only collegiate team to enter the Final 4. The team got the chance to take the bronze after beating the Philippine Army Lady Troopers in 5 sets in the game 1 of the best-of-three battle for bronze. Unfortunately, due to academic reasons, some key players were absent in Game 2 and Philippine Army easily won the 2nd game in straight sets. Series were no longer extended as the Sandugo Lady Conquerors already won the title.[14]\n\nIn UAAP Season 75, Valdéz broke the record for the most points scored in a UAAP women's volleyball game. She scored 35 points (31 spikes, 3 blocks and 1 service ace) in the second round elimination game against the Adamson Lady Falcons on January 20, 2013. The standing record before her record-breaking performance was 33 points set by an Adamson Lady Falcon, Angela Benting on February 14, 2009. She also surpassed the record of former Lady Eagle Charo Soriano which had a career high of 31 points for Ateneo.[15] Valdez was named the Best Scorer of the season.[16] Her scoring prowess helped the Ateneo team land again in the Finals but fell short to the defending champions, the DLSU Lady Spikers.\n\nIn the 1st Conference of Shakey's V-League Season 10, Valdez got the Best Server award. They were unsuccessful in defending their title after NU Lady Bulldogs beat them in Game 2 and 3 of the Finals.[17]\n\nIn UAAP Season 76, Valdéz, together with Bea Tan and Michelle Morente, took the bronze medal in the beach volleyball tournament. She became the team captain of the Ateneo women's volleyball team for indoor volleyball. She was named the Best Scorer, Best Server and Season's MVP. She also won the Finals MVP award after beating the defending champions, the DLSU Lady Spikers, which had a thrice to beat advantage.[18] Valdez was the first female volleyball athlete to win four awards in one UAAP season.\n\nValdéz got the Best Scorer Award again but this time, in the Shakey's V-League (11th Season Open Conference). She set a record for the most points scored in the entire conference with total of 342 points. The previous record set was 314 coming from Jaroensri Bualee.[19][20]\n\nValdéz led the Ateneo women's volleyball team, which represented the Philippines, in the 2014 ASEAN University Games held in Palembang, Indonesia and took home the Bronze. That was the first international medal of Valdez.[21]\n\nIn UAAP Season 77, Valdez tallied 312 points outscoring her previous season's finish. She was again awarded the Season's MVP, Best Server, and Best Scorer. They successfully defended their title against archrival DLSU Lady Spikers.[22] They finished the season with 16–0 sweep.[23]\n\nIn the collegiate conference of Shakey's V-League Season 12, Valdez scored a conference-high 32 points from 26 spikes, one block and five service aces against the CSB Lady Blazers during the elimination round.[24] She was named the 1st Best Outside Spiker and Conference MVP.[25]\n\nAfter being a reserve last UAAP Season 77, Valdéz returned to beach volleyball together with Bea Tan and Jhoana Maraguinot for season 78. They finished the season in second place after falling to DLSU Lady Spikers.[26] 2015 was one of Alyssa's most fruitful years.[27] She repeated the bronze medal with Ateneo in the 2016 ASEAN University Games held in Indonesia.[28]\n\nValdez surprised the volleyball community when she joined the Smart-Maynilad Net Spikers team in the quarterfinal round of the 2013 Shakey's V-League Season 10 Open Conference. She missed elimination round games due to her commitment with Ateneo in the UAAP beach volleyball.[29] She got the Fittest Player of the Conference special award from one of the conference's sponsors.[30]\n\nValdez joined the PLDT Home Ultera Ultra Fast Hitters club team under Coach Roger Gorayeb for Shakey's V-League Season 12 Open Conference.[31] She matched her UAAP record, scoring 35 points from 33 attacks and 2 aces against the Philippine Army Lady Troopers in the semifinal round.[32] She was awarded the 1st Best Outside Spiker and the Conference Most Valuable Player.[33] Valdez won her third Championship medal in Shakey's V-League after PLDT swept the Philippine Army Lady Troopers in the Finals.[34]\n\nIn the reinforced conference of Shakey's V-League Season 12, Valdez returned to the PLDT team on game 1 of the finals scoring 25 points from 22 attacks, 2 aces, and 1 block against the Philippine Army Lady Troopers.[35] The team swept the finals and Valdez won her fourth Championship medal and her second Finals Most Valuable Player award in Shakey's V-League.[36]\n\nAfter her UAAP career, Valdez joined the BaliPure Purest Water Defenders for the Shakey's V-League Season 13 Open Conference in a team mostly composed of former Ateneo de Manila Lady Eagles.[37] They won the third place in the Conference. Though she missed some playing time, Alyssa Valdez still got the 1st best outside spiker.\n\nValdez transferred to the Bureau of Customs Transformers a volleyball team competing in the 13th Shakey's V-League Reinforced Conference, they have a 5–2 record in the Elimination Round. They won against UP, Laoag, UST, Coast Guard and Air Force but lost against Pocari Sweat and BaliPure. With this 5–2 record the team got the third semifinals slot competing against BaliPure and they successfully made it to the finals facing Pocari Sweat lady warriors battling for the championship. In the end, they failed which resulted to a 1st runner up finish. Alyssa eventually got her 3rd Most Valuable Player award and 1st best outside spiker of the Shakey's V-League (Season 13 Reinforced Conference).[38]\n\nThai club, 3BB Nakornnont, announced on December 24, 2016, that they have signed up Valdez to play for them.[39] She was to debut for 3BB Nakornnont on January 29, 2017, in her club's win over King-Bangkok but was forced to skipped a match after only receiving her International Transfer Certificate hours before the match.[40] She debuted for her club almost a week later on February 4, 2017, in a match against Bangkok Glass, where her team lost all three sets.[41]\n\nFor the 2017 season of the Premier Volleyball League (reinforced and open conferences), Valdez joined the expansion team, the Creamline Cool Smashers.[42] It was during the reinforced conference when she was awarded her 4th PVL MVP award and the 1st best outside spiker award.[43]\n\nOn September 11, 2017, through an interview by Gretchen Ho, Valdez was tapped to play for Attack Line, a club team in Taiwan.[44] Valdez played for the team until December 31, 2017.[45]\n\nValdez played for the Philippines women's national volleyball team at both the youth and senior levels.[46]\n\nValdez led the eight placer Youth 16-Under Girls' Philippines National Volleyball Team in the 2008 Asian Youth Championship held in Pasig, Philippines.[47] In 2013, she became a member of Philippines National Senior Volleyball Team.[48] She was appointed the team captain of the Philippine team for the 2015 Asian U23 Championship.[49]\n\nValdez was a member of the Philippine National team that finished in third place in the 2014 FIVB Southeast Asian Zone Qualifier held in Quang Tri, Vietnam.[50]\n\nIn the 2015 Southeast Asian Games, she was assigned to carry the Philippine flag on the traditional parade of nations held in Singapore.[51]\n\nWhen the Spikers' Turf was re-established in 2018, Valdez was made president of the men's volleyball league, a fact that was only publicly announced in 2020.[52]\n\nSmart-Maynilad Net Spikers (2013)\n\nPLDT Home Ultera Ultra Fast Hitters (2014–2015)\n\nBaliPure Purest Water Defenders (2016)\n\nBureau of Customs Transformers (2016)\n\n3BB
