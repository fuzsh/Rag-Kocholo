        "text": "Tracey Fontenot, PT\n\nCo-Founder and Co-Executive Director\n\nRaised in Houston, Tracey grew up competing in sports. Her love of an active lifestyle and her passion for children inspired her to become a physical therapist.\n\nAfter receiving her undergraduate degree from Texas A&M (whoop!) and her PT degree from UT Health Science Center, Tracey joined Methodist Children’s Hospital where she served inpatients and outpatients. She also helped develop specialty care programs for children with special needs as well as a program to combat childhood obesity. Many of Tracey’s patients wanted to increase their activity by playing sports, but opportunities did not exist for all of her pediatric patients. Always up for a challenge, Tracey asked, “Why not?” Her answer was two words—Kinetic Kids.\n\nWhile she knows children with special needs benefit from our programs, she also loves watching the happiness they bring to family and friends! Her favorite moments are when sees families go from “my child never will” to “look at my child, he is an athlete.”\n\nTracey LOVES being a part of getting ALL kids onto a sports field. That’s probably because Tracey’s favorite place is on the sidelines cheering for her three teenage children at football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and volleyball.\n\nAnd when she isn’t at a sporting event? Find her volunteering as a board member of Scholars & Athletes Serving Others, serving on NISD PTAs and committees, running for exercise, laughing with friends on Girls’ Night, or cherishing a date with her husband.\n\ntracey@kinetickidstx.org\n\nKacey Wernli, PT\n\nCo-Founder and Co-Executive Director\n\nKacey has been serving children with neurological disorders for over 27 years. In her early years as a physical therapist, her pediatric patients always wanted to dance or do gymnastics in the therapy session. This led Kacey to become determined to figure out how to give all kids a chance to play the sports of their choice. Her tenacity led her to co-found Kinetic Kids. Watching Kinetic Kids thrive on the field, the stage, the court, or wherever their dreams take them, makes every day a joyful one for Kacey.\n\nWhen she isn’t hanging out with Kinetic Kids, you might find Kacey serving on a mission trip with her church, sneaking away to Dallas to spend time with her son, relaxing on her boat on Lake Medina, or on a long walk with Jax and Evie, her Siberian huskies.\n\nkacey@kinetickidstx.org\n\nJada Hallmark\n\nDevelopment Director\n\nJada joined the Kinetic Kids team in 2017 as a volunteer and in 2021 as our Development Director. A Houston, TX native and an avid athlete, she swam for the Rice University swim team and competed in the 2001 US Olympic Trails in the 400M Individual Medley and the 200M Butterfly!\n\nAfter earning her BA in Kinesiology in 2001 at Rice University, she collected her Master’s Degree in Health and Exercise Science from Colorado State University in 2003. She then spent seven years coaching Division 1 swimming before discovering her talent for fundraising and event planning while helping her children’s schools and sports programs raise money.\n\nJada’s competitive nature coupled with her love of sports and children is the perfect match for Kinetic Kids’ fundraising needs.\n\nShe is married to Patrick, head baseball coach at UTSA, and has four children who are each actively involved in their own sports.\n\njada@kinetickidstx.org\n\nTiffany Saenz Neal, PT, DPT, c/NDT\n\nOperations Director\n\nTiffany was planning a future in Pediatric Neurology when she met the dynamic team at Kinetic Kids in 2007. She jumped in as a volunteer and fell in love with how our programs sparked joy in special needs children with neurological deficits while bringing purpose to movement at sports like swim, baseball, and dance.\n\nInspired, she decided to pursue a different career as a Pediatric Physical Therapist. She hit the ground running with Kinetic Kids, helping develop our Internship program and serving as our first-ever intern in 2008. While attending graduate school she served as an Administrative Assistant and a swim instructor. After graduation, Tiffany was promoted to Lead Program Director and also served as a Pediatric Physical Therapist in clinical settings. Now, as our Operations Director she plans to help grow our program and fulfill her true passion, just helping kids be kids.\n\nTiffany’s Kinetic Kids connections do not stop there. She met her husband through his sister, Diana Neal, one of the original Kinetic Kids! They have two boys and a black lab. On a Friday night, you’ll find all of them snuggled on the couch for movie night. But don’t let that fool you. She is obsessed with running and riding her Peloton. And be sure to ask her to play a little air guitar for you…she once played lead guitar in an indie rock band!\n\ntiffany@kinetickidstx.org\n\nAnaly Flores, OTR\n\nSenior Program Director\n\nAnaly was born in Mexico but raised in the small border town of Del Rio. After a near drowning accident, Analy felt called to a career where she could help others live fulfilling lives. She attended the University of Texas at Austin where she began to pursue a career in occupational therapy. In 2012, Analy obtained her Masters In Occupational Therapy degree from the UT Health Science Center. Although she dreamed of returning to Austin, Analy ultimately made San Antonio her home.\n\nAs a pediatric occupational therapist, Analy has worked with children of all abilities for over 12 years primarily in the clinical setting. She found Kinetic Kids after working alongside one of our founders who convinced her to attend a Kinetic Kids baseball finale. She quickly fell in love and joined the team as a Program Director in 2016. Since then, Analy has served as the program director for many of our programs with musical theatre being her most recent passion.\n\nWhen not working, you can find her spending time with her husband Tony and their daughter Alba. Analy is also a fur mom to Kloe as well as her permanent fur-guest of honor, Lucy. She also enjoys finding and trying new coffee shops as well as a good run on a not so hot Texas day!\n\nanaly@kinetickidstx.org\n\nCarrie Valdez, OTR, MOT\n\nSatellite & Adaptive Sports Director\n\nFrom Alaska to Alabama and several states in between, this “military brat” now claims Texas as her home.\n\nAfter Carrie graduated BYU on a gymnastics scholarship, she pursued her masters in Occupational Therapy at Rockhurst University in Missouri. During her clinical rotation at Methodist Children’s Hospital, Carrie met Kinetic Kids co-founders Tracey and Kacey and formed a lasting friendship.\n\nAfter working at Easter Seals, she had her first son, Noah, who had Down syndrome. Merging friendship, gymnastic, OT and love of kids with special needs, she joined Kinetic Kids to start our first gymnastics program.\n\nFifteen years and five more children later, she still loves to see kids challenged to reach their full potential and she is currently working to expand our competitive programming.\n\nCarrie enjoys volunteering at church and spending time with family and friends.\n\ncarrie@kinetickidstx.org\n\nShelby Hunemiller, MS\n\nSenior Program Administrator\n\nBorn and raised in small town Iowa, Shelby studied athletic training and exercise science in undergrad where she became passionate about focusing on how children’s overall health and wellness benefit from exercise and sports. She decided to take her passion further by obtaining master’s degree in Adapted Physical Activity from Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania to learn more about individuals with disabilities in sports and exercise.\n\nDuring a 2021 internship with Kinetic Kids, Shelby fell in love with working hands on with children who have different disabilities and special needs. After joining full-time, she has become unseen hero who keeps Kinetic Kids operations running smoothly and providing assistance to staff at programs. Her favorite part of her day is seeing children with disabilities build confidence by participating in sports and fine arts opportunities with their peers.\n\nShelby also enjoys weightlifting, hiking the beautiful trails of Texas, trying the best foods in San Antonio, and cuddling up with her adopted Chihuahua, Wero.\n\nshelby@kinetickidstx.org\n\nAlli Welch\n\nCastroville Site Coordinator\n\nAlli has called Castroville, Texas home for most of her life.
