They make sure that participants have adequate resource materials and get those who are subject-matter experts as resource speakers to their training.\"\n\nGladys Babe G. Ancheta\n\nAccountant III\n\nResearch Institute for Tropical Medicine\n\n\"Attending to Center for Global Best Practices Training was all worth it. This training about Best Practices and Remedies to Avoid COA Disallowances helps us to be informed about common findings of COA and be updated of the COA Circulars and Resolutions to avoid disallowances. The discussions, especially the questions and answer portion brought enlightenment and profound information.\"\n\nMariael Valeza Cartajena\n\nFinance Analyst B\n\nPower Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation\n\n\"I would like to express my gratitude for the seminar, as it provided a valuable opportunity to refresh my understanding of budgeting. The title, \"Best Practices in Financial & Operational Budgeting,\" clearly indicates that it is a worthwhile seminar to attend.\"\n\nMcGlenn M. Llagas\n\nGeneral Accounting Supervisor\n\nD&L Industries, Inc.\n\n\"This is a highly logical topic and very relevant to our field of work. Understanding and appreciating the value of both finance and budgeting is highly recommended to come up with a sound and effective decision especially when you are in a business management set-up where whatever decision you do could make and break your organization.\"\n\nYancy T. Kirit\n\nSat. Office Supervisor\n\nPerpetual Help Community Cooperative (PHCCI)\n\n\"It was an informative two-hour webinar. As a first time Director, I was able to grasp the fundamentals and detailed roles, responsibilities and liabilities of a director. The resource speaker is very knowledgeable and was able to deliver the topics to be discussed.\"\n\nJoanne Aboganda\n\nDirector\n\nBataan Development Bank\n\n\"Leading to the event itself, I found it very nice that Center for Global Best Practices sends their participants the resource materials needed for the training. On top of that, i also think the constant reminders were very helpful for me to remember that there will be an upcoming training date.\"\n\nRafael Mikko O. Raquel\n\nCorporate Secretary\n\nRaquel Pawnshop, Inc.\n\n\"Being in a food and beverage industry for how many years, I have crossed different paths and encountered diverse human beings. The talk from Mr. Kamaneson Ganeson has spoken value to a man like me as I have valued dearly my stakeholders as they have been part of my fruitful journey to bigness.\"\n\nLester C. Yu\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nPresident & Director, Fruitas Holdings, Inc\n\n\"The event is suitable to the current company situations and conditions. The discussion can surely aid us in ensuring that the needs and requirements of our stakeholders are taken into account and the processes discussed are also applicable in our company. The discussion is easy to understand are relatable not only because we have already prior knowledge but also because the speaker has discussed it well and has given us different situations as example.\"\n\nMary Claire Clarin\n\nIMS Officer IV\n\nPhilkonstrak Development Corporation\n\n\"Attending the Tax Rights and Remedies event was truly enlightening. As an aspiring lawyer, I found the discussions on tax laws and regulations particularly insightful, providing valuable information for both SMEs and large taxpayers. Atty. Cabaneiro was highly knowledgeable and engaging, making complex topics easy to understand. I highly recommend this event to anyone looking to deepen their understanding of tax matters and stay informed about their rights and remedies. Kudos to the organizers for a well-planned and informative event!\"\n\nChristine Gianne Bautista\n\nSan Beda Alabang School of Law"
