Simultaneously, hospitals and other civilian infrastructures are being attacked.\n\nThe cultural institutions in the province recalled, in special morning assemblies, the legacy of the historic leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, about the cause of the Palestinian people and denounced Western governments’ complicity in those events. Cuba has repeatedly reaffirmed its stance on the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State in the face of the invasion and colonization promoted by Israel for more than seven decades.\n\nef/iff/ro/nmt"
