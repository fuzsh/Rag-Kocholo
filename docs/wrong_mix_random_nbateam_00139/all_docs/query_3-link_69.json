        "text": "Overview\n\nJorge Guttman’s practice is focused on complex business litigation and arbitration, with experience in both domestic and international disputes. Jorge represents large and small companies at all stages of the litigation or alternative dispute resolution process. Of note, he is experienced in international arbitration and 28 U.S.C. § 1782, an important tool for building and litigating cases outside the U.S.\n\nJorge is dedicated to the successful representation of his clients’ interests using an approach that is objective, favors productive communication and, where appropriate, balanced compromise. His experience includes obtaining multiple multimillion-dollar judgments, awards and settlements over the course of his career.\n\nOriginally from Venezuela, Jorge is bilingual in Spanish and English. As a result, his practice has a strong Latin American emphasis, in which he represents multinational clients in cross-border disputes. Active in Florida’s Latin American professional community, Jorge is a founding member and current Vice President of the Venezuelan American National Bar Association (VENAMBAR). He also serves on the International Chapter and on the Attorneys’ Division of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, .\n\nFostering diversity, equity and inclusion is at the heart of Jorge’s commitment to the legal profession and greater community at large. As the current chair of the firm’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, Jorge leads the group’s efforts in creating programs and initiatives that result in developing diverse attorneys and ensuring an inclusive culture at Gunster. Jorge is steadfast in his belief that law firms can and should bring together different perspectives and approaches to problem solving that result in a more comprehensive way to advise and serve clients."
