The security guards in charge of the immigrant center in Ciudad Juarez that burned down last Tuesday causing the death of 39 people, belong to the company Seicsa (Servicios Especializados de Investigación y Custodia), owned by Elias Gerardo Valdes Cabrera, honorary consul of Nicaragua in Coahuila and Nuevo Leon. Through this company, Valdés Cabrera has obtained contracts worth more than 3 billion Mexican pesos from the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador. At Wednesday's public hearing late in the day, the Secretary of Federal Security, Rosa Icela Rodríguez, never mentioned the name of this firm or who owned it. She merely said that an investigation was underway to determine whether the security company had "all permits in order."

In the videos of the fire at the Ciudad Juarez immigration station, it can be seen that Seicsa guards are inside the facility at the same time as government security agents. According to Diario de Juarez, three guards from Valdes Cabrera's company have already testified before the Attorney General's Office. Seicsa has several complaints of human rights violations, mainly in incidents involving migrants. A report by the Coalition of Civil Society Organizations sent to the UN in 2016 documented at least ten assaults by employees of this firm on migrants riding freight trains on the Apizaco-Guadalajara route.
