PAHCHANAN QHOSB LANB« CALCUTTA- VOLUME I INTRODUCTION AND BOOKS I-II INTRODUCTION In 1807 the Directors of the East India Company, in a despatch to the Governor General in Council recommended that a statistical survey of Bengal should be undertaken, and that the work should be carried out by Dr. Francis Buchanan who had been employed in the survey of Mysore; and Dr. Buchanan was accordingly appointed to this work, with the following directions from the Governor-General in Council, which were issued on the 1 1th of September 1807. “Your inquiries are to extend throughout the whole of the territories subject to the immediate authority of the Presidency of Fort William. “TTie Governor General in Council is of opinion that these inquiries should commence in the district of Rungpur, and that from thence you should proceed to the westward through each district on the north side of the Ganges, until you reach the western boundary of the Honourable Company’s provinces. You will then proceed towards the south and east, until you have examined all the districts on the south side of the great river, and afterwards proceed to Dacca, and the other districts towards the eastern frontier. “It is also desirable, that you should extend your inquiries to the adjacent countries, and to those petty states with which the British Government has no regular intercourse. In perform- ing this duty, however, you are prohibited from quitting the Company’s territories, and are directed to confine your inquiries to consulting such of the natives of those countries as you may meet with, or natives of the British territories who have visited the countries in question. “Your inquiries should be particularly directed to the following subjects, which you are to examine with as much accuracy as local circumstance^^ will admit. “1. A Topographical account of each district, including the extent, soil, plains, mountains, rivers, harbours, towns, and subdivisions; together with an account of the air and weather, and whatever you may discover worthy of remark concerning the history and antiquities of the country. “II. The Condition of the Inhahitcmts; their number, the state of their food, clothing, and habitations; the peculiar diseases to which they are liable; together with the means tha^ have been taken or may be proposed to remove them; the education of youth; and the provision or resources for the indigent. “111. Religion; the number, progress, emd most remarkable customs of each different sect or tribe of which the population consists; together with the emoluments and power which their priests and chiefs enjoy; and what circumstances exist or may probably arise that might attach them to Government, or render them disaffected. “IV. Tbe Natural Productions of the country, animal, vegetable, and mineral; especially such are made use of in diet, in medicine, in commerce, or in arts and manufactures. The following works deserve your particular attention : “1st. The fisheries^ their extent, the manner in which they are conducted, and the obstacles that appear to exist against their improvement and extension. “2nd. The forests, of which you will endeavour to as- certain the extent and situation, with respect to water con- veyance. You will investigate the kinds of trees which they contain, together with their comparative value, and you will point out such means, as occur to you, for increasing the number of the more valuable kinds, or for introducing new ones that may be still more useful. “3rd. The mines and quarries are objects of particular concern. You will investigate their produce, the manner of working them, and the state of the people employed. “V. Agriculture, under which head your inquiries are to be directed to the following points : “1st. The different kinds of vegetables cultivated, whether for food, forage, medicine, or intoxication, or as raw materials for the arts : the modes of cultivation adopted for each kind; the seasons when they are sown and reaped; the value of the produce of a given extent of land cultivated with each kind; the profit arising to the cultivator from each, and the manner in which each is prepared and fitted for market. Should it appear that any new object of cultivation could be introduced with advantage, you will suggest the means by which its introduction may be encouraged. “2nd. The implements of husbandry employed, with the defects and advantages of each, and suggestions for the intro- duction of new ones, that may be more effectual. “3rd. The manure employed for the soil, especially the means used for irrigation. “4th. The ^neans used for excluding floods and in- undations, with such remarks as may occur to you on the defects in their management, and the remedies that might be employed. “5th. The different breeds of the cattle, poultry, and other domestic animals reared by the natives. The manner in which they are bred and kept; the profits derived from rearing and maintaining them; the kinds used in labour; whether the produce of the country be sufficient, without importation, to answer the demand, or to enable the farmer to export; and whether any kinds not now reared might be advantageously introduced. “6th. Fences, the various kinds that are used, or that might be introduced, with observations concerning the utility of this part of agriculture in the present state of the country. “7th. Tlie state of farms; their usual size, the stock requir- ed, with the manner in which it is procured; the expense of management; the rent, whether paid in specie or in kind; the wages and condition of farming servants and labourers employ- ed in husbandry; tenures by which farms are held, with their comparative advantages, and the means which, in your opinion, may be employed to extend and improve the cultivation of the country. “8th. The state of the landed property^ and of the tenures by which it is held, in so far as these seem to affect agriculture. “VI. The progress made by the natives in the fine arts, in the common arts, and the state of the manufactures; you will describe their architecture, sculptures, and paintings, and in- quire into the different processes and machinery used by their workmen, and procure an account of the various kinds and amount of goods manufactured in each district. It should also be an object of your attention to ascertain the ability of the country to produce the raw materials used in them; and what proportion, if any, is necessary to be imported from other countries, and under what advantages or disadvantages such importation now is, or might be made; you will also ascertain how the necessary capital is procured, the situation of the artists and manufactures, the mode of providing their goods, the usual rates of their labour; any particular advantages they may enjoy; their compartive affluence with respect to the cultivators of the land, their domestic usages, the nature of their sales, and the regulations respecting their markets. Should it appear to you that any new art or manufacture might be introduced with iv advantage into any district, you are to point out in what nmanner you think it may be accomplished. VII. Commerce; the quantity of goods exported and imported in each district; the manner of conducting sales, es- pecially at fairs and markets; the regulation of money, weights, and measures; the nature of the conveyance of goods by land and water, and the means by which this may be facilitated, especially by making or repairing roads. “In addition to the foregoing objects of inquiry, you will take every opportunity of forwarding to the Company’s Botanical Garden at this presidency, whatever useful or rare and curious plants and seeds you may be enabled to acquire in the progress of your researches, with such observations as may be necessary for their culture.” The present volume contains Dr. Buchanan’s report for the districts of Patna and Bihar, which he surveyed in 1811-12: and it will be observed that in the arrangement of his report he carried out his instructions to the letter. An abridged edition of the report was published by Mr. Robert Montgomery Martin in 1838 as the first volume of his “Elastern India Every man who has any knowledge of Dr. Buchanan’s work admires, and is indeed amazed at his industry and capacity; each of his reports is a mine in which subsequent compilers of “statistical accounts” or gazetteers have delved; and though all might agree that some editing of these lengthy documents might be done with advantage, few would agree on what should be omitted and what retained; and all agree in condemning the abridgment of Mr. Montgomery Martin. The report is now published as a whole without abridgment. The Journal which Dr. Buchanan kept while he was making his survey in these districts, an ela- borate tour-diary, illustrating the attention which he gave to the checking of information received, was edited by the late Mr. V. H. Jackson, and published in the Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society in 1922 (vol. VIII parts III and IV). For an account of Dr. Francis Buchanan himself, of his life and work, the reader may be referred to Sir David Train’s Memoirs published in Calcutta in 1905 : “A sketch of the life of Francis Hamilton (once Buchanan) sometime Superintendent of the Honourable Company’s Botanic Garden, Calcutta”. The area with which Buchanan was concerned in Bihar and Patna was a part of the old zila Bihar, consisting of the pres<.»nt districts of Patna and Gaya, excluding on the south the parganas of Siris, Kutumba, Chirkanwan and Sherghati, and including on V the east tke area up to the Kiul river. Malda. Amarthau and Salemabad which is now part of Monghyr district. In 1812, the parganas abutting on the Son in the west of the area were transferred from the Shahabad jurisdiction; the northern part of Maner to the jurisdiction of the magistrate of Patna; and Masaura. Arwal, Ancha, Manaura and Goh, with the southern part of MEUier paigana, to Bihar. For this great area, of about 5,350 square miles. Dr. Buchanan made his great survey : topographical, archaeolo- gical. zoological, botanical, geological, economic, historical. The late Mr. Jackson, in the Appendix to his edition of Buchanan’s Journal gave a note on the Report on the minerals; and in his Introduction he explained the care with which Buchanan made his observations of the hot springs in the district. TTie scientific parts of the report : the enumeration and classification of the fishes, plants and minerals, are of the first class; and if Buchanan had done no more, it would have been surprising, in view of the limits of time imposed on him, and his small staff, that he was able to do so much. It is diffi- cult to speak regarding the statistical value of his elaborate economic and agricultural tables : his crop statistics are not tabulated in a manner which makes anything like exact com- parison with the results of the recent survey and settlement pro- ceedings possible. His estimate of the rural population, based on his estimate of the extent of cultivation will be found, if comparison for given areas is made, to agree in a quite remark- able manner with the results of later census operations. Buchanan based his map of the district on the map in Rennell’s Bengal Atlas. Mr. Jackson remarked that he preserv- ed the same scale, of ten nautical miles or 1 1’53 British miles to the inch. Place-names were indicated on his map by numbers; and a key was attached. When Montgomery Martin’s edition of the Behar Report was published, a reduced edition of Buchanan’s map was prepared, to conform to the size of the printed pages, on a scale of 21% miles to the inch : and owing to the reduced size of the map, much of Buchanan’s detail was omitted. Mr. Jackson remarked in his Introduction to the Journal that the value of Buchanzm’s maps would have been con- siderably enhanced if they had been reproduced on a some- what larger ^ale, such as that of eight miles to an inch, and a (reproduction on that scale has been prepared for the present volume. When Rennell made his map of South Bihar for the Bengal VI Atlas, Shahabad consisted of the northern parganas of what is now Shahabad district, together with the parganas of Maner, Masaura, Arwal, Ancha, and Manaura on the east of the Son. The southern portion of what is now Shahabad formed zila Rohtas, together with Japla and Bilaunja, now in Palamau; and Siris and Kutumba, now in Gaya district. The map of South Bihar accordingly gave to Buchanan, in the boundaries of zila Rohtas, the northern boundaries of Siris and Kutumba, not accurately shown by Rennell, to form part of the southern boundary of Bihar district; but after this, until he came to the Phalgu river, Buchanan had to show as the district boundary the north-eastern boundaries of Chirkanwan and Sherghati, wherein Rennell’s map would have been of no assistance. Rennell’s boundary, which Buchanan followed so far as it was of assistance to him, can hardly be called approximately cor- rect, if it is compared with the pargana map which was pre- pared at the Revenue Survey; though it roughly follows the actual boundary line, showing a salient of some kind where there is a salient, and giving a shape of boundary which resem- bles approximately the correct line. Buchanan’s boundary, where he lacks the assistance of Rennell’s map, is of much the same kind as Rennell’s roughly following the shape of the line, and it may at least be said that he has done the work as well as Rennell. From the manner in which the general shape of the line has been correctly followed, though his salient shown may be about five miles from its correct position, it would appear probable that he had some kind of pargana maps for a guide, of which he made the best use he could. His southern boundary is worst where it follows Rennell; and thence east- wards in Siris and Chirkanwan, where it is never within several miles of accuracy. The direction of the line is correct; but it is far south of its proper position; and the salient thrown out by Pahra, south-west of Gaya, is shown four miles east of its proper position. Henceforth, following the boundaries of Sherghati on the one side and Pahra and Maner on the other Buchanan is very much more nearly correct. The internal detail of the map, the courses of rivers and the relative position of towns, is generally correct. Buchanan s plan of Patna and Bankipore was published in March of 1925 in the Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, (Vol. XI part 1), with a commentary on its description of the river-front. The comparison of the original manuscript with Montgomery VII Martin’s edition was made by Mr. C. E. A. Oldham, C.S.I., and a typed copy of the omissions, and of the corrections required was made by Miss Anstey, to whom acknowledgment is due for the perfect manner in which this work was done. J. F. W.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE Districts of Behar and of the City of Patna CHA1>TE11 1 Extent, Genkrae Appearance and Soil The survey, which I have now made, includes the districts under the authority of two judges and magistrates; one who presides Extent and ovor the city of Patna and a Boundaries small adjacent territory, and the other who presides over what remains after several dismemberments of the dis- trict of Behar. This last is more usually known among the natives by the name Gaya, from the residence of the chief officer of police, and this would be no doubt a more proper denomination than Behar, as avoiding the ambiguity of applying the same name to a district and to a province. Behar was formerly much more extensive, but some time ago a judge having found the extent of his jurisdiction burthensome, persuaded govern- ment that his charge was too extensive, and in one sense this was no doubt perfectly true, as the labour that would have been required for the full and proper execution of the duties of his office vastly exceeded the ordinary powers of man; but then the district of which he complained was not 2 EXTENT AND BOUNDARIES attended with more trouble, either from extent or population than others usually arc ; and the expense of the establishment already kept up for the administration of justice and police, is quite enormous, and probably ought not to be increased. I’art of the district of Behar was thereforo sejjarated, and jdaced under the management of the Judge and magistrate of Ramgar and still con- tinues annexed to that jurisdiction. Another portion was annexed to Shahabad and continued for some years united to that district., but while this survey was going on, this part was separated from Shahabad and partly annexed to the City of Patna and partly, restored to Bchar; but at the same time, a portioji of what had previously been under the jurisdiction of Behar, was placed under the authority of the City magistrate. The Collector of Behar has under his care the revenue of by far the greater part of the territories that are under the two magistrates, but a small portion of the division of Behar called Duriyapur which constitutes Pergunah Melki, pays its revenue to the Collector of Tirahut, which is attended with considerable inconvenience. The district under the management of the Collector of Behar is, however, vastly more extensive than the jurisdictions of the two magistrates, as it. compre- hends, I believe, the whole of the Ramgar district. He resides at Pabia, which is the most convenient residence that could have been adopted, as all con- siderable zemindars require at any rate to have an agent at that, city to attend the court of Appeal; but the immense distance of many ])arts of the territory from the treasury and the petty nature of numerous properties heave rendered it necessary to appoint Tahasildars, or native assistants to the Collectors, nor without great inconvenience to the petty landholders could their services be avoided, although in certain instances their employment has undoubtedly given rise to evil practices. The territory of which I am now giving an account occupies the central parts of the Mogul province of Behar. Its greatest extent from the banks of the Kiyul to its south west corner near EXTENT AND BOUNDAMES 3 the Son, in the direction of east northerly, and west southerly, is about 120 miles, and its greatest width, crossing the above line at right angles, from Patna to the boundary of liamgar upon the Bardi river is nearly 80 miles. According to Major Rennell its southern extremity is in about 24“ 30' and its northern in 25\" 39' N. lat. Its eastern ex- tremity is about 2\" 3' east from the meridian of Calcutta, and its extends 1° 46' farther in that direction. By tracing the boundaries on Major Rennell’s map 1 find that it contains 5358 square miles, of which about 403 belong to the city jurisdiction and 4955 to Behar, but it must 1x3 confessed that the southern boundary towards Ramgar could not be traced with any sort of precision and that the boundary between the two jurisdictions is very ill defined. The errors in some parts however will pro- bably be com 2 )ensatcd by other errors of a contrary nature in other ^larts, so that on the whole the general result is not jirobably far from the truth; but with respect to the subdivisions, the claims are so discordant, and the territories so miserably intermixed, that very little reliance can be jilaccd on what I have been able to trace, esi)ecially as the details in the Bengal Atlas arc somehow liable to many great objections. With regard to the statements of the various kinds of soil and extent of cultivation, I found the jicojile more communicative than those of Bhagal- pur, but not so intelligent as those of Bengal. I took therefore great pains in travelling through the country in different directions, and in the cons- truction of the General statistical table (No. 1) I have been much guided by what I actually saw. The two districts, into which the territory that I am now describing has been divided, are very compact, except that the boundaries with Ramgar and with each other are very irregular, that a small corner of Saran near Dana 2 )ur projects across the Ganges and that a small detached corner of Bhagal- pur is included in the division of Sheykhpurah and should be annexed to Behar, and much con- venience would arise from rendering the boun- 4 EXTENT AND BOUNDARIES daries straight and well defined. The people of division Vikrampur in Behar are also very anxious to be placed under the magistrate of I’atna as vastly more convenient for their attendance, and being'a petty territory I do not see that this could add much to the oppression of his laborious duty. The residence is judiciously placed in the town and, although close by the boundary of his district, it is abundantly convenient for all concerned. The residence of the judge of Behar has not the same advantage, and is far from being centrical. It is true that his vigilance is peculiarly required over the populous and very disorderly town of Gaya; but the attendance of those from the eastern parts of the district occasions much inconvenience, and Baragang, the residence of (he ancient kings of the country, would liave been a more convenient situation. The old city of Behar is also a very fine situation, uncommonly healthy, rich and com- modious. The change, however, would occasion very considerable temporary inconvenience and expense, nor is the situation of Gaya so bad as to make a change necessary. Perha2)s on the whole, the greatest improvement that could be made on the arrangement of these two districts would be to j)laco the superintendence of the pilgrims and the police of the town of Gaya under the charge of the gentleman emjjloyed to grant licences, and to re- move the courts from thence to Patna. At present every zemindar must have an agent at both Gaya and Patna; but were the courts removed to Patna, the same agent would transact his business with both Judge and Collector. Besides the situation of Patna, although not centrical, would, for the greater part of the district, be fully more con- venient than Gaya. As the Jurisdictions of two Judges and magistrates in the same places might perhaps occasion some inconvenience, one of the gentlemen might act as Judge and the other as Magistrate for the whole of the united districts, a division of duties, which, if practicable on account of expense, would be very desirable, as many per- sons are very well qualified for one department, and quite unfit for the other. VA&IETIBS OF SOIL 6 The arrangement of subdivisions has not been quite so badly managed as in Bhagalpur, yet it is liable to very great objections. The jurisdictions are very irregular in boundary; in some places portions are detached and surrounded by other jurisdictions, some are of trifling size and importance, others are monstrous in extent and population, and finally others have their superin- tending officers placed in their corners. In this district there is much land of rather a poor soil ; but the proportion abso- soii lutely unfit for the plough is smaller than in Bhagalpur or Puraniya. Close up to the very hills is in general •arable; there being, even in their immediate vici- jiity, very little stony l)rokon land, and there are few of those extensive tracts of high sandy barren land, which in I’uraniya are so prevalent. The land occupied by rock or stone, as 1 hiive said, is confined almost entirely to the hills, and these are in general exceedingly rugged and barren. No part of them has been brought into cultivation, nor could it bo done to advantage. In a few fields near or among the hills small stones are scat tered amidst the soil ; but where other circumstances have been favourable, those do not impede the plough. Very few of the ishands in the Ganges belong to those districts, and its southern bank is in general high, so that the qu.antity of land which it hiis covered with sand is inconsiderable, and is chiefly confined to the islands. Near the larger rivers of the interior again, especially near the immense channels of the Son and Phalgu, the strong dry west winds of spring have blown from the parched beds of these torrents barge heaps of sand, which form little hillocks, frequently chang- ing phace, and perfectly barren, but the extent is not groat, ^and reaches only a very short way from the channels. The channel of the Son again is in some places of a toler,able soil, and in the dry season is cultivated without the smallest danger of interruption from its stream, although these cul- tivated parts are not at all higher than the surrounding sands, and cannot be considered as 6 VAEIETIES OF SOIL islands. Where the soil is alleged to bo incapable of cultivation, on account of its being too sandy and light, it is usually called shor, usar, reher, or bala. The third term is however more peculiarly ajiplied to the soil containing soda, which is always of a sandy nature, and some soils called reher con- tain no soda ; but all soils containing that substance are called reher. In the western parts of the district especially, is some high swelling land of rather a poor soil, and much neglected, being covered with thorny bushes, among which in the rainy season there is some pasture; but in the dry season it is exceedingly parched and dismal. This circumstance gives it the appearance of more sterility than it actually possesses, and on the whole it is much neglected, more however owing to the fault of its owners than its own defects; for where pains have been bestowed, it produces several crops. Although calcareous nodules arc found in various parts of these districts, I iiowhere hcaial them alleged as a cause of barrenness. Soda how'- ever is much more copious than in Bhugaljjur, and in some parts was reckoned to render the soil untit for cultivation ; while in others the fields on wdiich it effloresces are regularly cxdtivafed. Where the soil is fitted for rice, the soda seems to do no harm ; because during the rainy reason it is so much diffused by the water emjxloycd in the cultivation of this grain, that- it docs little harm ; but when con- centrated by drought, so as to form a white efflorescence on the surface, it wnuld seem to burn up whatever is attcmjrtcd to be reared. A soil red on the surface is very uncommon in this district, and is chiefly confined to some poor sandy lands; but in a few parts there is a yellowish clay very productive, when projicrly supplied with water it often contains calcareous nodides, and is found chiefly on the banks of the Ganges. The i)re- vailing soil is of an ash colour, more or loss inclin- ing to brown, and partly clay, partly mixed. The clay is most commonly called hewal, and on the whole is reckoned best. It is most retentive of moisture, and some crops can be reared on it in ELEVATION 7 the dry season without artificial watering, a cir- cumstance in these districts of great importance. The mixed soil in most parts of the interior of the country is usually called fairu, and must on all occasions be watered, even when cultivated with some of the crops, (wheat and barley), that on clay soil would, it is alleged, be injured by that operation ; and in fact almost the only thing that will grow on it during the dry season without wateti’ing, is the cicer arietinum {but). This pairu soil is however seldom very free, so that when it is necessary to have a field well dressed, the imple- ment ealled chauki is in general required to break its clods. Near the Canges, and.in the east side of the district the mixed soil is more usually called dhus or dorassa, and requircs>.lcss irrigation or even none, if it is liable to inundation. When the mixed soil is stifler than usual, and a{)proachcs to clay, in some parts it is called yuri-dorassa being then of a whitish colour; but in some places the guri is rec- koned a species of clay. In some parts again a rich free soil is called basori, while dorassa is confined to that of a poorer nature; and if the proportion of sand be very great, it is called balasundri. In the accompanying map, which is on the scale of the Bengal Atlas, I Elevation have attempted to give a deli- neation of the hills; but the scale being vastly too small to admit of names, or even numbers, I have given a map drawn on a larger scale by a native assistant, where references by numbers to a list of the hills in the index will be found. It must, however, be observed that few of the hills of any considerable extent have appro- priate names, and that each part of such is usually denominated by the village, which it overhangs; but in such cases each ascent to the hill {ghat) has usually an appropriate name, and these, as often as I can, shall bo mentioned in the maps. The hills here, like those of the western part of Bhagalpur, being all of what is called a primary structure, are exceedingly rugged, although some, from a difference of their component parts, ELBVATIOI< arc more broken than others; but this difference is chiefly observable at a distance. On a near approach all are found almost equally barren, and unfit for the plough. Their sterility is rendered more conspicuous by their nakedness ; for in many parts they seem incapable of producing even bushes; and where a few trees would spring, they are kept in a very stunted condition, being cut so soon as it is possible to convert them into charcoal. Nor is the naked and broken appearance of these hills in any degree enlivened by flocks, as for by far the greater part of the year they are too much scorched to produce any herbage. Towards the southern boundary however they are not so hideous. There the extent of forest gives an ample supply of fuel, and the i^recipices are covered with trees and bamboos sufficient to enliven the view, although they do not acquire great dimensions. A great many of the hills are scattered about with the utmost irregularity, and are quite insulated among the soil of the plains, by which they are surrounded; but in the heart of the district are three remarkable clusters. One on the west side of the Phalgu is of a roundish form, and contains a good many hills separated by various level pas- sages, and each possessed of an appropriate name. The whole cluster, by the natives whom I consult- ed, is called Barabar-Pahar, a name said to have been given by the Moslems. In ihe Bengal atlas this cluster is called the Currumshaw hills, the origin of which name, I presume, is as follows. A remain of antiquity called Karna-chaupar, or the seat of Kama is found on those hills. Major Eennell finding them celebrated for this antiquity, seems to have considered the final par, as the word pahar, a hill, and from Karna-chau, has formed Currumshaw. Another cluster or ridge is on the east side of the Phalgu, and runs about WSW. and ENE. for a considerable way. From its vicinity to the abode of many potent kings of the most remote antiquity, this chain is called the Rajagriha-pahar , hills of the palace. It consists of two parallel ridges with a narrow valley between, and is inter- sected by various passages. Adjacent besides to ELEVATION 9 the two ridges are many detached peaks and hum- mocks. The third cluster is the least considerable, and is a long narrow ridge adjacent to Sheykh- purah. It runs for some way from east to west, and then bends towards the north. It consists ojE a single narrow ridge with several interruptions and narrow passages. The elevation of none of these hills appeared to me considerable. Those immediately above the hot and sacred springs of P.aj agriha seem to be the highest, and to judge by conjecture, may be about 700 feet perpendicular height. The hills towards the southern boundary are more considerable, and some of them may be twice as high as those of the palfice of the ancient kings. They in general run easterly and westerly ; but, so far as the extent of this district goes, there are level passages among them in all directions; a continuation of hills, however, and of narrow vallies, reaches with little or no interruption to a great extent, and perhaps to Cape Comorin, and all these hills are considered as a part of the Vindhyan mounlains, by which the great Gangetic plain is bounded on (he south. The hills of this district nowhere approach the Ganges; and they in general arise immediately from the plain with very little, and often no broken ground adjacent to their roots. , The interior of the country, reckoning from the Ganges as an ocean, is in general flat, and does not rise into swells like the Bhagalpur district, so that it is better fitted for the cultivation of rice; but it is by no means liable to inundation, and has been fitted for this crop by vast pains bestowed in collecting and conducting water. In a few places the torrents from the mountains overflow their channels, for a day or two during the heaviest falls of rain, and do some occasional injury; but this is trifling, and such inundations, which happen only in some years, in general improve the fertility of the soil, over which they have extended, nor have I considered land liable to such accidents as inun- dation. In general, however, these torrents have worn channels of so great a width and depth, that they seldom overflow. 10 ELEVATION The immediate bank of the Ganges in most places is high, and is not inundated except perhaps in some spots, where at the very highest floods, for a day or two, it may be covered to a few inches. This land is called hhitha, as etlording a good situation for houses, or dihi, implying high. It is in general very rich, and highly cultivated. It gives in the rainy season a crop of maize or janera {holcus sorghum) inter- mixed with various articles ; and in the dry season large quantities of wheat, barley, poppy and vege- tables are reared by artificial watering. Where tlie Immediate banks of the Ganges are low, and sub- ject to inundation, they are called diyara. The whole extent of such land at all considerable is between Duriyapur and Suryagarha on the frontier of Bhagalpur, and it entirely resembles the very productive land of that district, to which it is adjacent. Parallel to the Ganges, and extending from the eastern extremity of these districts to a little west from Patna, is a low tract analogous to the Chaongrs of Bhagalpur, but in this district such land is usually called Tal or Jala, although in a few places the term Chaongr is also employed. Here such land is very well cultivated. Where the water covers the ground very deep, it can only be used for winter crops; but, where the inundation rises only a few feet, it has been intersected in all directions by small banks, which divide it into plots for rice, and exclude all water that is super- fluous; while sluices admit a supply, when the rain that falls on the plot is inadequate. The whole of this Tal or Jala, together with a few islands and low banks (Diyara) on the side of the Ganges, with the parts of the channel of the Kosi that are culti- vated, as before mentioned, constitute the inun- dated land of these districts. The term Tariyani, it must be observed, is here applied to the bank of the Ganges, whether high or low, whether clay resisting the encroachments of the river, or a soft mould crumbling every year in one place and collecting in another. In Nepal the %ame term is applied to the part of the kingdom ELEVATION 11 that is situated on the great plain of Hindustan, and implies the country of boats. In the 2nd table will be seen the proportion of the inundated land that is generally covered throughout the rainy season, and that is only covered, for some days at a time, twice or thrice in the season. CHAPTER II The Rivers In treating of the rivers of these districts I shall first give an account of the Ganges, and then of the rivers which fall into it. It might be dxpected that l.his immense river, fed by innumerable sources, The Ganges Springing from perhaps the highest mountains in the world, would in spring receive large additions from the melting snow, and would then receive a large in- crease. Some of ihe branches of the Ganges no doubt receive such an increase; but owing to the circumstances explained in my account of Pura- niya, the increase is in general by no moans consi- derable, and in the Ganges at Patna is little, if at all perceptible. The people indeed say, that no increase is ever observable, until a movable feast called the Dasahara,* which happens on the 10th day of the moon in Jyaishtha, and is in fact about the usual commencement of the periodical rains This year my people, who daily frequent the river to bathe, say that it has been gradually diminish- ing during the whole of the parching heats of April. The melting of the snow undoubtedly contributes to enlarge the river ; but is not able to counteract the causes of diminution ; and Patna is so far from the sources of the Ganges, or of any of its grand branches, that any cause suddenly affecting them produces no visible change. About the middle of May, however, the Ganges at Patna rose about a cubit; but this was probably owing to the partial showers of spring, as the Punpun, which has no Dasahara Gangasnan. THE GANGES 19 communication with the snowy mountains, rose about the same time. In this district the Ganges is nowhere fordable at any season, and its channel, when clear of islands, is generally about a mile wide; but in spring by far the greater part is a mere dry sand, covered with clouds of dust, which render all objects at any distance invisible ; so that, travelling oii its channel, one might imagine him- self in the midst of a frightful desert. The channel is almost everywhere pure sand, in a few parts however there is clay, which in the dry season is usually cultivated. The Ganges comes to the boundary of this dis- trict just where it is joined by the Son, a little way above the town of Sherpur. From thence it passes east with an undivided channel, until it reaches about two miles beyond the cantonments of Dana- pur, forming in general the boundary between the districts of Patna city and Saran ; but immediately above the cantonments a small corner of the latter is placed on the south side of the river. On this part of the Ganges, Danapur and Digha are the only places in these districts which carry on an export and import trade hy water. The island, when Major Rennell made his sur- vey, which was opposite to the cantonment of Danapur, seems to have been carried away; and that, which was then situated east from it in the middle of the river, now in a great measure adheres to the southern hank. In the rainy season a passage still continues open, but in the fair season its upper end becomes perfectly dry, and boats can no longer reach the Company’s clofh factory situated on the former bank of the river. This island is now about six miles long, and where largest, about one broad. The upper end belongs to this district, and the lower to Tirahut. In the rainy season some goods are exported and imported by water at the Company’s factory and at Barker-gunj. Many boats, however, especially those intended for the accomodation of travellers, are kept in the lower end of this channel at Barker-gunj. The main channel passing round the north side of the above mentioned island, does not now u THE QAN6XIS receive the Gandaki at Hajipur; a long, wide, and cultivated tongue of land projects from the west side of the Gandaki, and passing east about six miles from Hajipur, separates the stream of the Gandaki from the Ganges; but, as in the rainy season, a small channel separates this tongue from the northern shore ; the union of the two rivers is still supposed to take place where it did formerly, and on the full moon of Kartik the holy spot is fre- quented by immense multitudes, and at Harihar- chhatra on the west bank of the Gandaki, opposite to Hajipur, there is then held a very great fair, especially for horses. In the great channel of the sacred river, between this tongue of land and the custom-house at Patna, is a small island ; but both this and the tongue belong to Tirahut. Near where the river comes to Patna from the north, and near the custom house are Colonelgunj and Babuyagunj marts, where (here is much trade; and near the latter is the opium factory, from whence the exports are highly valuable. Below this island the main channel washes* the walls of the old city of Patna, where many goods are imported at Khajeh Kulanghat. Immediately below the old city is Marusgunj the principal seat of trade in Patna; and a little lower down, at Rckabgunj, there is some business. About the extremity of the suburbs, at Jafur Khan’s garden, the Ganges divides into two branches, which sur- round a very large island divided into two very unequal portions, and about nine miles in length. Part of both portions belong to the district of the city of Patna, and part to that of Tirahut. The river here taking a bend to the south ; the branch, which goes to the east of this island, is by far the largest; but boats of any size can at all seasons pass through the western channel between the island and Phatuha. This is a place where there is much trade. From the lower part of this island to Bar the Ganges runs easterly for about 21 miles with an uninterrupted channel. For some way part of the channel is claimed by the people of this district, but opposite to the whole division of Bar all the !tHE QANG^ffiS 16 channel is considered as belonging to Tirahut. For about eight miles however above Bar there runs parallel to the Ganges an old channel of the river, navigable in the rainy season alone, and separating from the main a narrow island called Ramnagar Diyara, which belongs entirely to this district. Bar is a place of very considei’able trade; but the oidy place between it and Phatuha, where exports or imports are made, is Kusbali-JNawada, a mart of very small importance. Below Bar the Ganges takes a considerable sweep to the north, and a narrow old channel separates from the main an island belonging to this district called Malai-Diyar, byt this channel is navigable only in the rains, nor is there any mart on this part of the river. Beginning about five miles below Bar, the Ganges runs SE. for about 28 miles to the boundary of the district of Behar with Bhagalpur. Opposite to Duriyapur, about 16 miles in a direct line from Bar, are two islands, one belonging to Tirahut and the other to Behar. Except at this last place the whole in this extent of the great channel of the Ganges is alleged to belong to Tirahut, but the whole south bank belongs to Behar. On this are Mokayang and Duriyapur, two small marts. About two miles below Duriyapur the Ganges sends off a small channel called Mar-Gang, or the dead river, which soon separates into two branches, each taking the same name, and after a course of eight or nine miles they reunite, and immediately afterwards, joining the Haluhangr, communicate with the Kiyul by means of the Rohuya. In the diy season the water of the Haluhangr Mar-Gang and other adjoining creeks seems perfectly stagnant, and in the floods sometimes runs one way and sometimes another, according as partial rains swell one channel more than another. On the banks of the southern or western branch of the Mar-Gang is situated Barhaiya, a small mart. The eastern and northern branch of the Mar- Gang, which when Major Rennell made his survey seems to have been the great channel of the river, is in some parts of its course called Sarla. It soon 16 THE RIVERS divides into two branches, the south western of which or the Sarla, rejoins the first described, and most westerly Mar-Gang; while the other, called also Mar-Gang, runs parallel and near to the great Ganges, until it approaches Suryagarha, where it joins the Kiyul. These three old channels of the Ganges, together with its present grand stream, and the Kiyul, include three very large and fertile islands, which have given rise to numerous dis- putes and bickerings, nor are the limits belonging to the adjacent districts of Bhagalpur, Tirahut, and Behar, at all clearly defined. In my account of the rivers which fall into the Qanges from the southern j)arts The Rivers whjch of Bhagalpur, I had occasion to fall Into the describe their general appearance, Ganges and it entirely resembles that of the following rivers, only that one of those in Behar, — the Son, is larger than any in Bhagalpur, and at all seasons and in every part of its course contains water above ground. This immense torrent forms the undisputed boundary between these two districts and Shaliabad for about 55 miles in a direct line from its mouth upwards, and is in general almost equal in size to the channel of the Ganges. After heavy rains the channel is almost filled, but does not overflow, and has a rapi- dity that is scarcely compatible with navigation upwards; but during the rainy season boats of five or six hundred mans burthen pass the whole extent of these districts, and small boats of 20 mans can pass the whole year. During the dry season there are many fords ; but the ferry boats in all places ply eight months in the year, and there being many long reaches that at all seasons have every where deep water, some boats are kept there throughout the year. The aspect of the river during the heats of spring is still more desert than that of the Ganges, and its eastern bank is in many parts over- whelmed wnth sandy, barren downs, blown up from its channel. In some parts the channel consists of clay and is cultivated. It is nowhere rocky, but with the sand is intermixed a variety of small pebbles, some of them very ornamental. iHE RIVERS 1? and the floods have strength enough to carry some of these as far almost as the mouth of the river. The Son, according to the Bengal Atlas, formerly joined the Ganges at Maner, but a tongue of land has been formed, projecting east from the Shahabad district, so that Maner is now three miles at least above the junction of the two rivers. The Son receives no branch during its course in these districts, but sends off some old channels that in different places are called by its name. The chief of these separates from the river 11 or 12 miles above Maner, runs straight east to the Thanah of Vikram, and then bends north until it passes Thanah JSfoubutpur. Immediately beyond this it sends to the right a branch, which, running through the whole breadth of the division of Baki- pur, joins the dry channel of the Ganges, and is called Mahauliya. The main channel of the Mar-Son, soon after the separation of the Mahauliya, divides into two branches, which re- unite before they fall into the Ganges at Danapur. That to the west is called Deonar, that to the east is called Bhadaiya. It must however be observed, that an old channel may be traced running from this Mar-Son, and parallel to the Ganges, a great part of the way to Bakipur, near the western extremity of Patna city, and this may have been the old channel of the Son, and Patna may possi- bly therefore have been once at the junction of this river with the Ganges; but among the natives I can find no tradition concerning such a circumstance; and the place where the two idvers now join is con- sidered holy, and held to have been so from time immemorial. North, a little way from where the last mentioned Mar-Son separates from the present river, a similar channel, also named, Mar-Son, separates, but rejoins the river after a course of six or seven miles. At Maner also another channel separates from the Son, and rejoins it just where it falls into the Ganges. These branches of the Son are of no use either in navigation or for watering the fields. The great Son is too deep sunk in its channel for the last mentioned purpose ; and its power during the rainy 18 THE RIVERS Beason could not be controlled by dams : nor is it of much use in navigation. Some timber and bamboos are floated down in rafts; and during the rainy season some goods are imported and exported by its means at Daudnagar in the district of Behar, and Maner in the district of Patna. By far the greater part however of the exports and imports in the vicinity of the Son are made by land carriage. I proceed now to describe a river called Punpun (Pompon), which from the number of canals that it supplies with water for irrigation, is of vast importance to agriculture. l\"or this pur- pose, indeed, some of its tributary streams would appear, since the time of Major liennell's survey, to have been entirely diverted from its channel, and have been so much subdivided among the fields, that they can no longer be traced to a junction. In the driest part of the year it contains a stream to its very junction with the (janges, but it is of very little use in navigation. Small boats could occasionally go up in the rainy season, but the voyage is too uncertain, and goods are therefore transported almost entirely by land carriage, but ferries are required. The Punpun comes from the Raingar district, and soon after receives a torrent named Adri, which flows from the same quarter. Some miles below this it receives from the same direction a river named Madar. In February I crossed the Punpun, a little below the junction of Madar, and found its channel about 100 yards wide. It contained a fine clear stieam, j^crhajrs 30 yards wide and knee deep. A little lower down the Pxinpun receives a rivulet which passes Goh, and therefore must be what Major Rennell called Goorah, but my people say that its name is Bilaro, and in February it is so very inconsiderable at Goh, that it was passed without observing it. Major Rennell gives it, a long course from Ramgar, but my people could only trace it from Angti in the division of Sahebgunj, its course having been probably interrupted by canals for irrigation. Between Tikari and this channel at Goh I crossed two fine rivulets, that to the west called THE RIVERS 1 » Nera, that to the east named Sinane. In February both contained fine streams of v^ater, with which they supply the adjacent fields; but it is said that neither reaches the Punpun; both are previously entirely distributed among the fields. In the time of Major Rennell it would appear that upwards they united, and were two branches of one river rising in Ramgar; but I was assured that this con- nection can no longer be traced. Both run in small channels of very stiff clay, which prevents their water from being absorbed in the dry season, and resists their action during floods. Both are now alleged to rise in the Sahobgunj division, but the Nera passes through a projecting corner of Ramgar. From the mouth of the Bilaro the Punpun has downwards a very long course without receiving any addition, or wiihout sending off any branch, canals for irrigation excepted; and thus passes through the divisions of Daudnagar, Arwal, Jahanabad and Vikram, in Behar. On entering the district of Patna, in the division of Noubutpur, R sends to the west a small channel named the Pangchhara, which joins the main stream towmrds the northern boundary of the division. In Novem- ber I crossed the Punpun at Pitwangs (Fetwas river), just above where the division takes place. Its channel there is about 150 yards wide, and was then half covered with a dirty stream about two feet deep. From entering the district of Behar, until the reunion of the Pangchhara, the general course of the Punpun is about north east; but at the junc- tion it runs nearly east, and runs in that direction about 18 miles, until it joins the Ganges at Phatu- ha. About midway it receives from the north a con- siderable branch named the Murahar (Moorhur river). This comes from the Ramgar district, and soon after dividing into two branches that reunite, forms a large island. The smaller channel on the west is named the Bur (Boorah river). Below the reunion, in December, we crossed the Murahar at Pangchananpur, where it is much larger than the Punpun, being perhaps one-third of a mile wide. THE RIVERS 90 The stream is not however larger, but was then beautifully clear, and contained many small fishes, for it never becomes dry. Soon after the reunion ©f the Bur the Murahar at Tikari again divides into two arms and surrounds a large island; but there the western arm retains the name, and the eastern is called Bur, and subdividing again separates the island into two unequal parts. These branches called Bur, as the name implies, are merely old channels of the river, and are no where applied to the chief stream, as by the care- lessness of the engraver has been done in the Bengal Atlas. Below the union of these arms I, in February, crossed the Murhar, where it was a sandy channel about 200 yards wide, wuth a very small clear stream. A little below' these islands, and on the boundary between the divisions of Sahebgunj and Jahanabad, the Murahar sends to the east a branch named Dardha, which will be afterwards men- tioned. I shall previously treat of the western channel, which retains the name Murahar, but is the little Pompon of Major Ronnell. It runs south the whole length of the division of Jahanabad, and then intersects in a very irregular manner the boundaries of that division of Vikram and Noulmt- pur. In November I crossed it in a projecting corner of Vikram near Bhagawangunj, where both banks belong to that division, and found that its channel, w^hich, higher up in a loose sandy soil, is about 500 yards wide, is, where I have specified, in a stiff clay, reduced to about 30 yards. It con- tains some pretty deep pools of dirty water, but in the fords that intervene, it has little stream. A little below where I crossed it, the Murahar forms a considerable island by a channel named the Katri, which is detached from its East side. From the reunion of the Katri the Murahar runs about 12 miles NE., through the divisions of Noubatpur and Phatuha, to join the Punpun. I now’^ return to the eastern branch of the Murahar named Dardha, which would appear to have been formed since the time of Major Rennell’s siirvey, and is more considerable than the w’^estem THE RIVERS 21 branch, which retains the name Murahar. From the boundary of Sahebgunj it runs south and easterly, above 12 miles, to the town of Jahanabad, where it receives a fine little river named the Yamuna, which enters the division of Sahebgunj from Ramgar, and soon after receives from its east side a torrent named the Bagdaha. Some way be- low the junction I crossed the Yamuna by the best bridge by far that I have seen in the course of the survey, and built by Raja Mitrajit of Tikari. After that brigde the Yamuna contains a pretty considerable stream, but its channel, being a stiff clay, is narrow. Below the bridge some miles, the Yamuna receives from the west a. small drain called the Dhanawe, which in December is so inconsider- able that I crossed it without notice, it being diffi- cult to distinguish small rivers from the numerous artificial canals made for irrigation. Below its mouth I crossed the Yamuna in February. The channel was there about 100 yards wide of a clay very retentive of water, as the stream extended from side to side. It had scarcely any current and was about two feot^ deep. The channel of the Dardha after receiving the Yamuna at Jahanabad is about 100 yards wide, and in December both channels contain streams. From Jahanabad the Dardha (Pomna R) runs north-east about 24 miles, and joins the Punpun a little below the mouth of the Murahar. About 2 miles below the mouth of the Dardha the Punpun receives, from the inundated lands south from Patna, a drain named Baradmuta, Midway between the mouth of the Baradmuta and Phatuka the Punpun sends to its south a small channel named the Dhoya, which joins the Mahatain, a branch of the next river that wdll be described at Phatuha, where the Punpun enters the Ganges, it has very high steep banks (30 feet perpendicular), and it may be 100 yards wide. In November it requires a ferry. In February it is fordable, but contains a considerable stream, and its banks consist of very stiff clay, which renders the ford bad, and a wretched temporary bridge is therefore erected. S2 THE RIVERS I have already mentioned that Major Eennell gives the Murahar, in the lower part of its course, the name of little Pompon, but the only river called Chhota Punpun, of which I could hear among the natives, is a small drain, which passes under a bridge between Shumushpur Jafurabad (Futwa R) and Jafur Khan’s garden. This drain comes from the low land behind Patna, and in November is perfectly dry; but in Major Rennell’s time it would seem to have been the principal stream of the Pompon, although the size of the bridge, which is old, appears little fitted for such a state of rivers. I now proceed to treat of the Phalgu, a river which is remarkable for its sanctity, and by its numerous branches intersects more than half the district, but its nomenclature is confused. It is formed a few miles above Gaya by the union of two immense torrents, named the Mohane and Nilajan. The former, although the least celebrat- ed of the two, and although rather the smaller, I shall consider as the principal source of the river, because the lower part of the channel towards the Ganges is called by its name. It enters the district of Behar from Ramgar about 20 miles south-east from Gaya, and in December contains a considerable stream; while its channel, which is very sandy, may be 300 yards wide. After passing for some way through Behar, it has that district on one bank, and Ramgar on the other, but soon again re-enters the former. Some way below, at a place considered holy, it changes its name for a short space, and is called the Saras- wati. Two Burmans of rank, who lately came with a view of reporting to their king the condition of the places in the neighbourhood, which ho consi- ders holy, informed a Sannyasi, whom they con- verted to the doctrine of Gautama, that in the Pali language this river is named the Mahananda; for from their books in that language they were able to trace the situation of the places, in search of which they came. The other branch, of which the Phalgu is composed, in the Hindi dialect is named Nilajin. It enters the district about 11 miles south from Gaya, and is a sandy channel about 400 yards iherivebs wide, but its stream in December was not so con- siderable as that of the Mohane. Opposite to the extensive ruins of Buddha-Gaya, this river is separated by a sandy channel into two arms. The western in the Hindi dialect is named Kanaksar; but in the Pali it has the name of Subarnasar ; the eastern and largest arm in the Hindi is called IN'ilajan and jN'iringchiya in the Pali. Both in December contain streams, but very trifling. The Phalgu, formed by the union of these torrents, soon reaches the high and rocky shores of Gaya, where, when free of islands, it may be 500 yards wide; but in many jflaces islands con- siderably swell its dimensions. .In the beginning of January water stood on many parts of the surface; but there was little or no stream to con- nect the pools, and in the heats of spring it becomes perfectly dry; but at all seasons plenty of good water may be fjrocured by digging a very little way into the sand. It is usually said, as if believed, that the holy part, which extends about half a mile, occasionally flows with milk, but I have not met with anyone who pretenued to have seen this occurrence, nor to describe the appearance, which has given rise to the opinion. From Gaya the Phalgu runs north-easterly with little change for about 17 miles, when opposite to the Barabar hills, it divides into two branches, and the name of Phalgu is entirely lost. Many indeed i)retend, that this name should be entirely confined to tlie part of the river that is sacred at Gaya, and that all the remainder should be called Mohane; but the people in the vicinity seem usually to extend the term to the whole channel, between the fork about three miles above Gaya, and this fork situated about 17 miles below the holy place. I shall first give an account of the western- most, of the branches, into which the Phalgu divides, and which is named the Sungr. From the place of separation it runs some way west to the rocks of Barabar, where it receives a small muddy channel named the Bhurbhuri. The Sungr then turns south, and in February, when I crossed it, 84 THE RIVERS the channel, which was perhaps 250 yards wide, had a small stream of clear water, which must he fed from springs issuing below the separation, as both the Phalgu and Mohane were then guite dry. About 10 miles from its separation from the Mohane the Sungr sends, from its west side, a channel called the Bhutaha which, with the Sungr, and a branch called the Mahatain, includes an island, perhaps 10 miles in length. About 2 miles below the separation of the Bhutaha the Sungr sends to the east a channel, which is named Mala-Kathar, and rejoins it below, after forming an island about 8 miles long. The Sungr, immediately before it recovers the Kathar, sends to the west a branch called Maha- tain, which, as I have just now mentioned, receives the Bhutaha and, running north a little way, surrounds a small island by an arm named the Berthuya. Immediately after the reunion of this the Mahatain receives from the west a short drain named the Kharuya. Soon after the junction of the Kharuya the Mahatain sends to the North a creek, which ends in a marsh, while the river itself bends to the east, and joins the Dhoya, a branch of the Punpun that has been already mentioned. The united channels are called Dhoya and, after passing the whole breadth of Helsa, join the Mohane in the division of Bur. The Sungr, after having sent off the Mahatain, runs past the town of Helsa, and a lit tle way be- low receives the Dhor, a drain which rises from a marsh, and receives a considerable addition from a canal named Amnar, which has been taken from the Sungr high up and communicates with the Mohane by another channel named the Man- singhi, after which it is increased by a drain from the vicinity of the boundary between divisions Holasgunj and Helsa. A little way beyond the junction of this Dhor the Sungr falls into a channel called the Nanayang, which comes from the Mohane, as will be after- wards mentioned. Dhe rivers I now return to the eastern branch of the Phalgu, which resumes the name Mohane, and is a sandy; channel about 400 yards wide, which in February has no water on the surface. A little way below the fork the Mohane divides into two arms, which enclose an island about 20 miles long. The western arm, which retains the name Mohane, passes Holasgunj, and some way below that sends off to the west the channel named Mansinghi Above this its course is nearly north ; but where the Mansinghi separates, it turns to the north-east, and soon after passes Islamnagar, a pretty large country town, where its channel is about 100 yards wide, and contains a stream under ground, for canals cut obliquely across the channel procure in February small streams for the irrigation of the fields. Near Islamnagar the Mohane sends to the north the channel named Nanayang, which, as be- fore mentioned, receives the Sungr, about 13 miles after its separation from the Mohane, and after a course of six miles farther north falls into the branch of the Punpun called Dlioya. In this space the Nanayang communicates by a short channel with a small drain named the Chiriwang, which runs parallel to it on the east, and after a course of about 10 miles joins the Dhoya about a mile below the Nanayang. The Nanayang, when 1 crossed it in the end of January was a small sandy channel quite dry. The Chiriwang is so in- considerable, that I did not distinguish it from the numerous canals, by which the country is intersected. I now return to the east arm of the Mohane which is named Jalawar, and is a sandy channel about 100 yards wide, that in February contains no water above the sand, but plenty under the sur- face. About 12 miles from the folk the Jalawar receives from the south a small drain called merely Nala or drain. A little above, where the Jalawar rejoins the Mohane, it receives from the south a river of very considerable length named the Pengwar. This comes into the division of Sahebgunj, from Ram- gar, at the west end of great hill named Lohabar. 4 36 I'HE BIVERS Near the hills of Maher, where I crossed it on the last of November, it is a small channel in a deep stiff clay, but containing a line stream of water. A little below where I crossed, it received a stream similar to itself but which has a shorter course, rising from springs in iSahebgunj division. This is named the Bangsi. Soon after receiving the Bangsi the Pengwar passes through a chain of low rocky hills, where in December I found a considerably ra])id but dirty sti'eam, passing through a narrow rocky channel. The l^engwar then passes by Narawat, at the north-west corner of the Itaja-Criha hills; and near the boundary of Sahebgunj receives, from between the two ridges of these, a small torrent named Alyani. From thence it has a long course north- east, through Holasgunj, to the boundary of the division of Behar. It then turns north, separating Behar from Holasgunj, until it joins the Jalawar; but in this space sends off' an arm namotl Itawang, which joins the Mohane some way below the reunion of the tJalawar. Although the Phalgu, after the junction of the Mohane and NilajaJi, is a great channel, from 500 io BOO yards wide, and, allliough after heavy rains this immense extent is often tilled with water, rushing pasli (faya with tremendous noise and velocity ; yet the chief continuation of the Mohane, below the junction of the Jalawitr is a channel perhajis 20 yards wide, Init deeply sunk in a stiff clay; and on the 22nd of dan nary, when I crossed it, it contained only a little dirty stagnant water, and in the dry season dams of clay arc made across it to tuiri the. water upon the fields. In the rainy season the numerous branches and canals, into which the Mohane is subdivided, receive the immense torrent, that rushes down the Phalgu, and disperse it through the country, so that it seldom overflows. This part of the Mohane, after receiving the branch of the Pengwar named Itawang, sends to the east a branch named Barhal, which is soon lost by subdivision among (he fields. After sending off the Barhal the Mohane winds THE RIVERS 87 towards the north-east, through a very low country in the division of Bar until it is joined by ithe branch of the Punpun called Dhoya, which has been often mentioned, and which brings with it ,the water of all the western branches of the Phalgu. At Cheongrogunj, a little above the junc- tion, small boats can come during the rainy season, but there is little or no trade at the place. The Mohane, after receiving the Dhoya, runs along a short way tliiough this low inundated land, wTion it divides into two arms that surround an island about 12 miles long. The northern arm is small, and in dili'erent parts of its course is named Thara Agar and Dhoga. d'he Soutliern channel retains the name Mohane. In the rainy season boats of 500 mans burthen can pass, but there are no markets on its bank. This arm of the Mohano communicates with the Pangchanc river by a small cut or payen, but before 1 treat farther on ils course, I shall trace the Mohane to its end. After the union of the two arms the Mohane passes east through the low inun- dated land for about, two miles, and then receives a drain from l)ehind Bar, which is named Jalwar or Jalhar. It then runs SE. through the same land for about 15 miles, during which it receives the two princi})al branches of the Pangchanc named the Bangri and Dhanain, and also the Tati and Som. Between the mouth of the Dhanain and the Tati the Mohane receives from the north two drainings. The upj)ermost called. Deonayi receives from the w’cst a branch named Baha, the lower is named Barnar. This part of the Mohane in the dry season is a deep clay channel, perhaps 100 yards wide, filled wdth water, which restagnates from the Ganges, and reaches within 14 or 15 feet of the level of the country, which in the rainy season is overflowed. Boats can pass at all times, but little or no trade is carried on by their means. The Mohane on the junction of the Son loses its name, and the remainder of its channel, until it joins the Kiyul near Bulguzur, passes nearly east little changed in appearance, and the means which it offers for the conveyance of goods, seems TBE RIVERS K to be in a great measure neglected. This part of the river is named Haluhangr. Before the Halu- hangr joins the Kiyul, it receives the Mar-Gang, as already mentioned. I now return to describe the three rivers named Pangchane, Tati and Som, which join the lower part of the Mohane. The nomenclature of the Pangchane is to the last degree perplexed. It derives its name from its being imagined that it is composed of five rivers, although it is in fact formed by the junc- tion of the Dharar and Teturiya, which unite at an abode of the ancient king Jarasandha, and assumes the name Pangchane. The Dharar has, however, two principal branches, the Dharar and Tiliya; and the Teluriya has three principal streams, the Dhanarje, the Sob and Kluiri which, in the opinion of the natives, form the five branches of the Pangchane, and I shall proceed to describe them in the above mentioned order. The Dharar (Dahdor R) ent^^rs the division of Sahebgunj from Ramgar and soon after receives from the east end of the great mountain Lohabar, a small torrent named Baghai. Some miles north from thence, where I crossed the Dharar at Futehpur, it has a wide rocky and sandy channel, and on the 30th of November contained a fine clear rapid stream. From thence the Dharar, after a northerly course of about 12 miles through a plain country, enters a hilly district and turns NE. There it is a sandv channel 60 or 70 yards wide and in the ^niddle of December was dry on the surface, but little canals dug into the sand collected fine streams for watering the fields. After a course of about 10 miles through this hilly country the Dharar receives from the South, a smaller torrent named Jokahar, which rises in the plain of Sahebgunj, and then enters the hilly country, running parallel nearly to the Dharar. I nassed it among the hills where its channel may be 20 feet wide, but in December it contained a good deal of water which was stagnant, owing probably to dams for the purpose of irrigation. The united stream of the Dharar and dokahar T&E RIVEBS >9 run NE., about 3 miles and then receives the water of the 2nd of the five branches of the Pangchane, named Tiliya. This comes from a passage in the hills of Eamgar named Bilaro-ghat and, after pass- ing a corner of Sahebgunj, enters the division of Nawada, through which it passes almost straight north for about 25 miles to unite with the Dharar. Some miles, however, after entering Nawada it receives, from the West, a torrent named Harkhari, which comes from the hills towards the boundary of Eamgar. I crossed it at the junction where the Tiliya is a sandy channel about 100 yards wide, and in the middle of December contains a small run of water. The Harkhari is not near so wide, but contains fully as much water. Although the Tiliya is the larger river, it loses its name on joining the Dharar, which continues to run NE., about 5 miles and then joins Teturiya to form the Pangchane. About midway it receives a small torrent named the Ban-Ganga, which comes from the Raja-Griha hills. This part of the Dharar is a sandy channel about 200 yards wide, and on the 12th of January contained a little stream of clear water. The third branch of the Pangchane is named Dhanarji. Immediately south from the highest neak of Durbasa-Eishi, named Anggari, the Dhanarji is formed bv the union of the Chali and Ganggi, two considerable torrents, that come from Ramgar. and after entering Behar, run 3 or 4 miles to the place of junction through a verv wild hilly country, abounding in mines or quarries of mica. The Chali is placed to the south of the Ganggi, and the united streams, having taken the name of Dhanarje, this runs some way west behind Durbasa; and as it crosses a narrow vallev that extends south to the passage called Pangehbahini- ghat, receives from thence a small torrent. On approaching the great hill Sringgi Rishi. it bends north between that hill and Durbasa. There the channel is about 100 yards wide, and in December contains a fine clear stream, but the water a mile or two below is then entirely absorbed by the sand. Small canals, however, dug across 30 THE RIVERS its channel, procure a valuable supply for irrigation. A little below Rajauli the Dhanarje receives from the great hill Sringgi-Rishi, a small torrent of the same name, and then runs west for about 2 or 3 miles, when it receives from the South a river at least as large as itself, and named the Donaiya. It comes from Ramgar and, before entering the plain of Nawada, passes a wild country to the west of Sringi-Rishi. I crossed it immediately above its junction with the Dhanarje, and found it a wide sandy channel, which in December gave a supply of water by small canals dug across its bed, but on the surface was dry. From the junction of the Donaiya the Dhanarje runs nearly south for about 18 miles, when it unites with the Khuri to form the Teluriya. The Khuri (Coore R) is formed by the union of two of the branches of the Pangrhane. That farthest west is called Sob, is very inconsiderable, and rises from the plain of Nawada, of which it must be considered as a petty drain. The Khuri is a mountain torrent, which enters this district from Ramgar, and comes between the great hills Mahabhar and Baksuya. It turns round the west end of the latter, and from its south side receives a mountain torrent named Belan, which passes through a rugged country abounding in quarries of mica, that belongs partly to Behar, partlv to Ramgar. After receiving the Belan, the Khuri runs NW., for some miles to receive the Sukhanar, and is there a sandv channel about 20 yards wide, which in December is quite dry, but among the hills the Belan contains a little dirty water. The Sukhanar is still smaller than the Khuri and springs from Durbasa. The Khuri, after having received the Sukhanar, runs NW., some miles farther, and then receives the Job torrent, which comes from between the same great hills, Maha- bhar and Baksuya, which bound the upper part of the Khuris’ own course. Immediatelv below the junction, at Akburpur, the Khuri is a narrow THE RIVEES 31 chaunel, but contains a pretty little stream. It then runs north to a low ridge where it passes between Sherpur and Kulana, and there receives a small stream, which comes Ironi the west end of Mahabhar hill, and is much subdivided lor cultiva- tion. At iNawada the Khuri is a channel about 80 yards wide, and in December contains a stream. A little lower down it receives tlie ttob, and the united stream called Khuri, a short way below, unites with the Dhanarje, and lorms the Teturiya. The Teturiya has a short course towards the north, and about 4 miles above Giriyak unites with the Dharar to form the l^angehane, and is a river of nearly the same size and appearance, which has been already described. T'rom its formation, by the union of the Tetu- riya and Dharar, the Pangchane runs north about 13 miles to the ancient city of Behar, above which it is a channel about 200 yards wide, and in December contains a considerable clear stream, but low'er down is much subdivided and formed into various channels, which seem originally to have been artificial, and all afford a copious supply of water for cultivation. The chief branch of the Pangchane, and that which retains the name, passes west from the rock of Beliar, little dimi- nished in width, but containing less vvator than in the higher part of its course. About 3 miles north from the rock it- sends to the west a channel named Mankain, wdiich after a short course is lost in a marsh on the frontier of Bar, although it receives from the south a small stream of some note in Hindu legend. This is a small torrent named at first the Saraswati, which rises between the two ridges of the Raj agriha hills, and passing north by the opening between Baibhar and Bipul, receives the water of many fine springs, hot and cold, sacred and prophanc. These united form a pretty rill that wdnds by the w^estern side of the fortress of the ancient kings and, passing north, soon changes- its name to Kathain, and then to Baha and Amura, after which it joins the Mankain. After the separation of the Mankain, the prin- cipal and western Pangchane runs NE., for about THE RIVERS Sfi 13 miles, when it turns round with a bend to the !SW. At the bend it sends to the east a channel^ which immediately divides into two arms. One named Beloya runs SE., and after a very short course rejoins the Pangchane. The other branch named the Fangreya, runs first a short way ME., and then communicates with the Mohane by a cut (Fayen). The Fangreya then runs east parallel to the Mohane, which it joins after a course of about ten miles. The Faugchane, after having run south- westerly about 2 miles, bends to the east, and at the bend receives the water of the branches, which separate at Behar, to which 1 now return. The uppermost channel named Adya passes to the south of the chief part of the present city, and runs ME., about 12 miles, when it unites with the second channel called the Senggarhat. The Adya, where I crossed it east from Behar, is a sandy channel 400 yards wide, but M^orth from the town, where it separates from the Fangchane, and not more than a couple of miles higher up than this wide part, it is very trifling. In the beginning of January the surface is dry. The Singgarhat is formed by two channels, which pass round the old fort or city of Behar, running in part through its ditch and uniting a little below, where they form the Fawangra, which after running ME., some way, takes the name of Singgarhat and, as I have said, joins the Adya. The united channel of the Singgarhat and Adya, after a very short run, joins the Fangchane, where it bends to the east, as just now mentioned. The Fangchane, after bending to the east, runs about 2 miles farther, and is then joined by its arm called Beloya, as has lately been mentioned. On this junction, botli names are lost, and the united channel is called Khanuya; but, on joining a river called the Dhanain, takes that name. The Dhanain is formed by the junction of two rivers, Kumri and Sakri, and from their union to its junction with the Khanuya has a very short course towards the north.. The Kumri and Sakri are in fact two arms of the same river, which I shall now trace from its sources. THE EIVEHS The Sakri rises by two sources from the great hill Mahabhar, which forms the boundary between the districts of Behar and Ramgar. The source farthest east, my native assistants insist upon, be- ing the proper Sakri, but the people who were with me on the spot, where it issues from a gap in the mountain, called it Manggura, It is there the finest mountain torrent, that I have seen in the Vindhyan hills, and in December rushes with a clear rapid considerable stream, forming occasionally deep rocky pools filled with fish. This is within the boundary of Ramgar. A little lower down, on the plain, it is joined by a similar, but smaller, torrent, which rises within the boundary of Behar, but for a short way forms the boundary with Ramgar. When I was on the spot, the people with me called it Dighor, but my native assistants say that its name is Bhutaha. The united stream is no doubt the Sakri, and passing NW., to the points of the great hill named Siyur receives a fine little stream, which rises from a sacred pool named Kokalat, which also is situated at the foot of Maha- bhar. This is joined some way from the pool by another torrent from Mahabhar and, then assum- ing the name of Amni, some way below joins the Sakri. The valley on the banks of the Kokalat I think exceeds in natural beauty any place that I have seen in the course of this survey and, owing to its fertility, to the grand hills by which it is surrounded, and the copious supply of pure water, is capable of being rendered a most magnificent abode. From the west end of the Siyur hills the Sakri runs north for about 23 miles through Nawada, and in this part of its course is an exceedingly great channel. East from Nawada, it is as large as the Phalgu at Gaya, and in December contains rather more water. On reaching the boundary of Sheykhpurah it divides into two arms that enclose an island about 15 miles in length. The eastern arm preserves the name and sends off a small channel, the Sakrinala, which joins the Tati to be afterwards mentioned. Although this preserves the name, it is very inconsiderable, and in some Bi THE KlVBRS parts almost entirely obliterated. The western arm of the Sakri called the Kumri takes a sweep into the division of Behar, where it divides into two arms that enclose an island 6 or 7 miles in length, the eastern arm preserving the name, and the western being called Geran, The Kumri is at present the principal channel of this river and may be 100 yards wide, fn January it contains stagnant pools of dirty water. The Geran is a small channel, but in January contains some water. The united channels of the Sakri and Kumri, as I have said, form the Dhanain, which after a course of about two miles to (he north receives the Pangchane, and having turned east and having run about 0 miles in that direction, joins the Mohane. The Tati is a small river that joins the Mohane. It rises from a marsh called Maraital in the plain country of Nawada, and after a course of about 18 miles north is joined by an inconsiderable old channel of the Sakri, as before mentioned. The Tati is there a small channel winding in stiff clay, and in Janary contains a good deal of dirty stagnant water. From thence it turns NE. and passing among some small rocks west from Sheykhpurah receives from thence the small channel named Rataiya. It (hen continues to run about 7 miles in the same direction and joins the Mohane there called Dhanain. The next river to be described is the Som, which rises from Gilaurghat on the great hill, that extends west from Gidhaur, but which has no general name. The Som here is very inconsider- able. After running about 7 miles north, it receives the Kailas, which comes from the west end of the same great hill named at that part Uruya. This is also a very inconsiderable torrent, and for some way forms the boundary between Behar and a detached portion of Bhagalpur, which Behar surrounds. About 4 miles below the junction of the Kailas, the Som receives from its east side a rather more considerable torrent named the Bahuyara, which rises from the same great hill of Gidhaur. THE RIVERS 95 About 2 miles lower down the Som receives from the same side and same hill, a similar torrent named the Dhuruya, which passes some way through Bhagalpur, before it enters Behar, but is so inconsiderable that it \"escaped my notice, when I was taking an account of the rivers of that district. About 3 miles still lower down the Som receives from the west side another small torrent named the Lata, which rises from the west end of the great hill SE. from that of Gidhaur, but which has no peculiar name. The Lata runs first west along the south side of this hill, and coming to its west end turns north, where it is a small sandy channel, but supplies some fine canals for irriga- tion. From the end of the hill to its junction with the Som is about 17 miles north easterly; and before its union it changes its name to Dhungd, is a little enlarged, and its channel in December contains some stagnant pools of water. About 4 miles farther north the Som receives another torrent from its west side. This is named the Kairihari, and rises from a deep recess in the Siyur mountain called Karkharghat. In Decem- ber, whore it enters the plain, it is a small dry tor- rent. Its whole course towards the NE. is about 30 miles in a straight line, and SE. from Sheykhpurah in December it is a small channel, sunk deep in clay and containing a good deal of dirty stagnant water. About 2 miles north from the junction of the Kairihari the Som unites with the Mohane, and the united channel assumes the name of Haluhangr, stagnates backwards for some way into the Som, so that in December it was necessmy to use a boat in crossing the mouth of the latter. It only remains to notice the Kiyul, which forms the boundary of Behar with Bhagalpur; but the whole of its course on this boundary has been already described in my account of the latter district. I have nothing to offer on the rivers in general, additional to what has been formerly stated, especially in my account of Bhagalpur. CHAPTER III Lakes and Marshes In these districts we observed nothing that could be called a lake, and the marshes, properly so speaking, are of little or no extent. The greater part of the country, indeed, for the cultivation of rice is converted to a marsh in the rainy season, and is then, if possible, preserved under water until December; so that, until after the rice harvest, travelling is exceedingly difficult, but this is arti- ficial. The Jala or Chaongr lands, that run parallel to and near the Ganges from Patna down- wards, more resemble marshes; but in November they in a great measure become dry, and are then ploughed and sown. Some reservoirs are of con- siderable extent, and marshy soil, and are almost the only places worth notice, that can be called marshes; but their number is small, and they are in a great measure artificial. CHAPTER IV The Air and Weather On this subject, in this district also, I am under the necessity of relying entirely upon the report of the natives. By far the most prevalent winds as in Bhagalpur arc from the east and west, and in most parts of the district nearly in the same proportioii. On the banks of the Ganges towards the Sone, it was stated that the west winds most usually pre- vail from the beginning of Magh (13th January) to the middle of Chaitra (26th March). From thence until the end of Jyaistha (12th June) the east and west winds are nearly equal. From thence to the middle of Sravan (end of July) the east winds pre- vail. From thence again until the middle of Bhadra (end of August) the west winds prevail. From thence to the middle of Kartik (end of October) the east winds return; and finally from thence until the 10th of January the east and west winds are nearly balanced. Both this year, 1812, and the last, the east winds have prevailed during the four months of spring, when the west winds should have predominated. In the rainy season, especially near the Ganges, there are occasionally north and south winds; and on the banks of the Sone it is alleged, that whatever wind may prevail in the day, every morning the wind comes from the south ; and while I was there, this no doubt happened. This is a strong confirmation of the winds being influenced by the course of great ijivers. In many parts of the district the south winds are considered as highly injurious to vegeta- tion; and if they blow for three or four days at a time, occasion heavy loss. The west winds also are injurious to vegetation; and if they are strong THE AIR AND JVEATHER 33 early in the season, injure the crops of wheat, barley and opium. The west wind drys up the juice of palms, while these bleed freely during the prevalence of wind from the east. Although the west winds are injurious to vege- tation, they are most friendly to animal life; and the seasons, in which easterly winds have prevailed much, have always proved unhealthy. In the heats of Spring storms from the north-west are usual, and I heard it commonly said that they are generally accompanied by rain or hail. It was, however, alleged by a gentleman, who has resided some years at Patna, that at this city these squalls are seldom accompanied by either rain or hail and certainly it so happened the year that I passed in the place. Such rains are in fact unwelcome, and in this district are considered as interfering with the harvesting of wheat, barley, and poppy seed. The rainy season is usually of the same dura- tion as in Bhagalpur; but when the fall in Aswin (15th September-15th October) has not been very copious, the crops of rice suffer, unless there is a good deal of lain in Kartik (16th October-13th November). These rains, however, do no good to any other crop, and if the fall in the end of Aswin has been copious, are not required even for the rice, llains, which happen in January, are injurious to most crops, especialy to wheat, although the fields of that grain require at that season to be artificially watered. This is a curious circumstance, but I am assured by a vast variety of authorities that it is well founded. The rains in January, it must be observed, do little harm, if the falls be sudden, and are immediately succeeded by sunshine; but two or three days of cloudy weather, with drisizling rain, entirely burn up the crop of wheat. Fogs usually prevail in the morning, from the middle of December until the middle of February, but this year as well as last I did not observe one foggy morning, nor hear of any person who had observed above two or three. In Bengal this is considered as a prognostic of scanty rain; but last year the rain fell in abundance. The dews are not nearly so copious as towards the east; and when THE AIR AND WEATHER 39 a west wind blows, they are scarcely observable. The winters are much tne same as in Bhagalpur, and the one, which I rassed in the district of Behar, was much milder than any of those which I passed in the northern parts of Bengal. All the people, however, who can possibly procure it, sleep by a fire at night; but fuel is very scarce, and they would suffer more than the people of Bhagal- pur, were not their huts warmer. I often heard of frosty nights having destroyed some of the crops; but, although two or three such were said to have occurred while I was in the district, I observed no degree of cold that approached that temperature, while I have known ice formed spontaneously in the .most southern parts of Bengal. This country is however more favourable than Bengal for the artificial production of ice, the dry westerly winds necessary for that operation being more common, as mentioned in my account of Bhagalpur. The heats of Spring are here very severe, and are exceedingly aggravated by the dust, there being then no vestige of herbage. At that season not only the west winds, but those from the east, when strong, are hot and parching. By means of hurdles placed at the doors and windows, and kept cons- tantly wet, rooms may be kept very cool and pleasant, when these winds are hottest and strongest; but when it is calm, or light airs prevail, these hurdles give little or no relief, and the only remedy is to exclude the external healed air and dust as much as possible. The nights are then tolerably cool, but towards the end of the rainy season are very oppressive. The heat of this dis- trict, upon the whole, is much higher than that of Tirahut. The difference between Patna even and Hajipur on the two banks of the Ganges is very observable, and between Gaya and Muzaflurpur is much greater than the trifling difference of latitude can be supposed to produce. This seems owing to a greater moisture and more powerful vegetation in Tirahut ; but among the natives Behar is consi- dered as a very healthy country, while Tirahut is far from being so, although, except its northern parts, it is not so bad as some of the districts 40 TliE AIR AND WEATHER farther east. It must be also observed, that Patna and Gaya are hotter than most parts of the dis- trict. The heat of the former seems to be owing to a great extent of naked sand on an island of the Ganges immediately fronting the town. The heat of Gaya seems to be owing partly to the immense sands of the Phalgu, and partly to the reflection of the sun from the arid rocks, by which the place is surrounded. Thunder is much in the same pro- portion as in other districts; but there is I believe less in Spring, owing to the squalls of that season being more moderate than in Bengal. In Jyaistha of the Fusli year 1218 , that is in May, A.D. 1811 , there was here a very strong gale, which blew down many trees and huts, and killed several people. It was stronger here than at Mungger, but there also it did some harm. It was by no means, however, a tremendous hurricane, nor are such tempests at all common. The winds seem to be more temperate than usual in Europe. Petty earthquake shocks are as common as in Bengal, and occasion as little alarm. CHAPTER V Topogr\\phy of the Divisions Preface containing liistorical notices The people here are perhaps still less interested on this subject than in Bhagalpur, and even the Moslems seem to have abandoned all care of their history. At Bchar, where several persons of good family and excellent manners reside, although one of them is called a Moulvi or Doctor of Law, I could not procure from them any account of the Muhammedan governors of that city, nor did they possess any one historical book. In this district the remains of antiquity are exceedingly numerous, but the traditions on the spot concerning them are very often altogether irreconcilable with appearances or with credi- bility, and still oftener contradict the few histori- cal hints to be found in Hindu legend, while very often the people have no sort of tradition concern- ing the antiquities of their vicinity.
