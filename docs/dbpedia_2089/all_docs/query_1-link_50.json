        "text": "Nearly every country in the world, including India, has policies intended to promote universal access to telecommunications services, despite the absence of evidence of a market failure in the industry. Universal service policies typically involve cross-subsidies among types of telecom consumers and among telecom providers. India&#39;s New Telecom Policy of 1999 set goals of providing telephone and Internet access in\n\nThis paper is looking on the issue of Universal Service Access Fund in Indonesia particularly on the performance of the telecommunication company to contribute based on the Act No. 36 of 1999 on Telecommunication. The material presented is this paper is only based on literature available. Toward the ends, this paper will help to establish the surrounding scenario on the overall performance of USAF in Indonesia.\n\nUniversal service was defined for basic wired services until the 21stcentury. As an emerging country, Turkey was also using universal service fund for this purpose. Turkey has also been expanding the mobile coverage during the last decade. There have been many projects to achieve this goal. The last one of such studies involves combining universal service with rural coverage. This new approach to universal service which is called “Universal Service Study for Mobile Coverage” is expected to bring coverage to the last 2128 locations that do not yet have GSM coverage. This paper explains the process up to now and ongoing Universal Service approach. The related data obtained from various sources is provided along with the model reflecting the determination of candidate locations for universal service coverage."
