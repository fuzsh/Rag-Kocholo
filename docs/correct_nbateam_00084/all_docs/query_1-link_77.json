        "text": "Thu, Jun 23, 2011 at 9:00pm\n\nMAVS ADD RUDY IN THREE-TEAM DEAL\n\nIn a three-team trade, the Denver Nuggets acquired the rights to Jordan Hamilton from the Dallas Mavericks, Andre Miller and a future second-round draft pick from the Portland Trail Blazers, the Mavericks acquired Rudy Fern√°ndez and the rights to Petteri Koponen, the 30th pick in 2007, from the Blazers, and the Blazers acquired Raymond Felton from the Nuggets and the rights to Tanguy Ngombo from the Mavericks.\n\nWhat does it give the Dallas Mavericks\n\nThis is a steal for the Mavs. While Hamilton has some star potential, Dallas is trying to repeat as the NBA champion and Fernandez is a great talent who can step in as their new starting shooting guard (something they need). The Trail Blazers didn't give Fernandez the opportunities his talent warrants, and he can could finally get those chances with Dallas. Meanwhile Koponen is a quality point guard who can be an above-average NBA playmaker the second he steps foot on an NBA court. Overall this is a great swap for the defending champions.\n\nWhat does it give the Portland Trail Blazers\n\nThe Blazers are a mostly young, up-tempo team and Felton is a nice fit for them at the point. Felton is one of the NBA's better court generals and needed a change of scenery after being an ill fit with Denver last season. Ngombo is a prospect who will take awhile to develop, but the Blazers obviously like him.\n\nWhat does it give the Denver Nuggets\n\nIt's hard to dislike what the Nuggets have done here. Miller is a quality veteran point guard, and is a better fit as a backup for the emerging Ty Lawson than Felton. Meanwhile Hamilton is a gifted scorer with star potential who can help replace some of the offense Denver lost when they moved Carmelo Anthony to the Knicks last season."
