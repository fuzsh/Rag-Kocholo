For four days, youngsters are learning fundamentals and life lessons from the point guard.\n\nFelton may not be a Blazer for long. He's a free agent and says he will test the market this summer. The first day teams can conduct free agent business is July first.\n\nFelton averaged 11.4 points and 6.5 assists a game in his only season in Portland. Felton, who turns 28 next week, earned $7,560,000 last season. He says he plans to get married this summer."
