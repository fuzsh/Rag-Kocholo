        "text": "Over the course of time I could not help, but to think about his career situation, which leads me to my question…Why is it Felton cannot be Elite?\n\nComing out of UNC, Felton was the Star PG, who we all just \"knew\" would be on the type of level as a DRose, CP3, Dwill, Rondo etc.\n\nAt age 27 with 6yrs under his belt, he has made himself a very very decent PG for all to rely on.\n\nThe only problem with the Bobcats, was that they were bum as hell and he did not have a decent supporting cast to do anything special with. Keep in mind for him not to be an Elite guy, he managed to put up 13.3ppg and 6.4apg over 5 seasons in Charlotte.\n\nA highlight of all highlighted careers last year IMO, was Felton’s breakout year in a Knicks uniform. If a year ago anyone would have told me, Raymond pairing up with Amare` would translate to Double-Double averages damn near 20ppg and 10apg, I would have told you to jump off the Empire State Building, head first.\n\nThe only downside to a career year, was the the deal that moved him to Denver, which was another indicator to me that he would be shopped again, with Lawson being the Nuggets PG of the future. In only 21 games played in the Pepsi Center, he still managed to give Karl 11.5ppg 6.5apg.\n\nNow this brings us all up to date… Portland 2011-2012 What should we expect?\n\nI have a few tidbits on why he probably is not considered \"elite\":\n\nHis shooting percentage is pretty damn low. He is at 41.2% FG and 33.3% 3 PT for his career, which is not really that great. You could point to Chauncey Billups having similar troubles with overall FG shooting, but he is a much better long distance shooter, free throw shooter and defender. Plus, Chauncey is not exactly considered elite anymore at 35.\n\nYes, he was considered a top draft prospect and was the man in HS, but that is no guarantee for success. Not to mention, never remember thinking Raymond was a lock for being elite. Deron Williams and Chris Paul were certainly considered much better NBA prospects in 2005. This has translated to them being much better NBA players. They are much more efficient and better in just about every sector of the game.\n\nAlso, look at the guys you named FG % compared to Raymond: Rose (46.9%), CP3 (47.1%), DWill (46.3%), Rondo (48.6%). Not to mention, all of them do multiple things better than Raymond and have played integral parts on winning teams. Think that might be why they are considered better than him.\n\nTy Lawson is a flat out more efficient PG than Raymond. He pressures the ball better on defense, shoots better and his end-to-end speed is elite. Raymond is a solid athlete and all, but Tywon is so much more efficient, he was the obvious choice to start over Ray Felton.\n\nHow is that Marvin Williams analogy even applicable? First of all, Raymond’s stats improved and all, but I would say 17.1 and 9 would entitle one to still have to take a swan dive off the Emp State. I mean, Shawn Marion’s numbers were about the same with D’Antoni as coach. But, Steve Nash’s numbers went from strong to two time MVP candidate.\n\nRaymond had the ball in his hands a lot, was the second offensive option as opposed to the third after S-Jax and Gerald Wallace in Charlotte. Plus, Chauncey Billups averaged 17.5 in 31.6 mpg, while Raymond averaged 17.1 in 38.4. He did averaged more assists than Chauncey, but he did not have Melo taking as much control of the ball as he does.\n\nThe final thing is, while Raymond put up nice numbers in New York, his becoming a back-up in Denver should show you the deal that keeps him from elite status. He is a good player, but to those crying for him to be an All-Star last season, he does not appear to be in that caliber. The Knicks were 28-26 with Raymond running the team. I mean, is that elite? Not really.\n\nAs a Blazers fan and supporter, I am cool with having Raymond Felton as my PG. But, I still trust Andre Miller much more running my team. Andre is a flat out winner, he is a smarter player and I think the Blazers might have been better off this season with him running the team. I am honestly worried about Raymond’s transition to a team that stresses defense such as the Blazers. How can I be sure he will be a step up from a guy like Andre Miller, who seems to provide a winning atmosphere everywhere he goes? He is indeed a better long distance shooter and more athletic, but I have yet to see him be as efficient a floor general.\n\nThese are a few of the reasons why I do not believe Raymond is in the \"elite\" category of PG. Here are PG’s I would rather have than Raymond Felton for THIS season, in no particular order:\n\nChris Paul\n\nDerrick Rose\n\nDeron Williams\n\nRajon Rondo\n\nRussell Westbrook\n\nStephen Curry\n\nTony Parker\n\nSteve Nash\n\nJohn Wall\n\nJrue Holiday\n\nBrandon Jennings (May be a tad naiive, but I see him improving this season)\n\nKyrie Irving\n\nTy Lawson\n\nAndre Miller\n\nChauncey Billups\n\nNow, he may end up passing a few of the older guys, but those are 15 names right there. What would make a PG \"elite\"? Well, I would think the ability to take your team to another level that an average PG otherwise would not be able to take it. I have yet to see this quality from Raymond Felton. There are 30 teams in the NBA, I listed guys from 13 different teams. Raymond is in the top half of the leagues starting PG’s, I suppose, though I think guys like Devin Harris, Kyle Lowry, Darren Collison and Mike Conley are fairly close to his ability as well.\n\nRaymond is indeed 27 years old and entering a new scenario. He is taking over for a team that has been a play-off staple for three years. Of course you have the departure of Brandon Roy, but keep in mind that Roy only played 47 games last season, in which the Blazers were 25-22 (were 23-12 without him). They upgraded at back-up guard with Jamal Crawford, but the most major change will definitely be having Raymond replacing Andre Miller.\n\nRaymond will not be counted on to score too much, considering that LaMarcus Aldridge will be the main option, followed by Gerald Wallace and Wesley Matthews. Plus, you have guys like Jamal and Nicolas Batum who can score as well. The key for Raymond will not be putting up huge numbers, but running a winning team. This will be the real test to see if he is an elite level PG. If the Blazers do not make the play-offs, or get significantly worse without suffering injuries, than I think a lot will fall on his shoulders. If they stay the same, I still do not know if you could call him elite. But, if he helps this team contend, than you may be onto something. Right now, I think their are definitely reasons for him not being in the category of the best PG’s in the game.\n\nMikeyV made some good points but this goes deeper than numbers in some instances. Has he been elite to this point? No. Is it out of his range to be in the elite catagory? We will see, but I dont believe so.\n\nThe FG%, you are dead on….not sure if he will improve much on that, but the bottom line is, he has gone as the success of his team has gone. He has been on some bad teams. Did you take in consideration that incidentally the best season the Bobcats ever had was the same season Felton shot a career high .459 (46%) from the field? How about his career high of 38% from 3 point range that year? Those numbers are very close to your elite list numbers.\n\nLets go to the Denver trade for a min. I specifically remember that when that trade was completed, they asked George Karl who would be the starting PG….he flat out said Ty….even though Felton had not even arrived in Denver yet. He never even coached the guy. He didnt know how he would work in the system. That should tell you something when concerning a guy who was basically having a breakout season statistically. The fact of that matter is, Raymond was never even given that opportunity because the plan was not to keep him in the first place. I do agree that Lawson is a more efficient player, but from a numbers perspective….Felton probably gives a little bit more in terms of points and assists. Efficiency works for Karl though, so I get that. Billups was moved to make room for Lawson. Felton was just part of the deal. I dont disagree with Karl at all but it wasnt all because Felton wasnt as good as Lawson, its just that he was part of a deal to a team that didnt need him. They never planned on keeping him and they said that last year because they said at this point they know Ray wanted to be somewhere where he could start. Yet and still he didnt do too bad in Denver playing on or off the ball. His point totals dropped but that shouldve been a given. His assists were still on point and not too bad on turnovers. He made 28 out of 61 from 3pt range too.\n\nIts not a good look to have Felton come in and start over Lawson when the latter has been there learning the offense and Billups has been moved out of the way…while the former is only there for a short stay anyway. That to me signifies more of you giving confidence to the man who is going to be your lead guy in the future. To a degree this is why the Clips told Billups he was going to start before he even got to L.A. Not that Chauncey is not worthy or capable, he is, but after how he threatened to be disruptive, they didnt pick him up to sit him behind Mo Williams. Mo Williams is on the way out. Makes no sense.\n\nAs far as not remember him being elite in the draft, I dont remember it going down like that. What I remember was Deron Williams leapfrogging CP3 and Felton who were both rated MUCH higher during the season. What happened was an extraordinary tourney run that gave Williams much light. DWill was 3rd in scoring on the team that year, behind Head and Brown. Brown handled the ball a lot. DWill’s draft rise was similar in a lot of ways to Westbrook’s. Before that, the top PG’s were Paul and Felton. If you say 44% from 3pt range for Felton was misleading that year, how misleading? DWill was shooting 36% from 3 (42% overall). Felton, 44% from 3 and 45% overall. Misleading? I dont understand unless you mean the difference between the college and NBA lines. (memphistyga)\n\nThe scouts got it right. Williams has been the better player. He was a much better pro than he was collegiate. Same as Westbrook. But this jump didnt come until after the tourney and pre-draft time. Fact of the matter is…Felton and Williams had identical numbers that year with the difference being Felton shot better from the field and had more NBA talent around him, so on paper, Felton looked as if he had the edge. I dont remember mid season anyone saying Williams was a NBA elite level prospect….but then again, I am getting old…lol.\n\nI agree with most of the points you make Mikey, I dont believe its open and shut on Felton, particularly when just going by stats. The thing about NYK winning 28 games with Felton is…..how many games did they win before him? 29. The whole year. Stat was a big part of that, but Feltons contribution should not be disregarded.\n\nI am just giving my perspective. If Portland improves largely in part due to Felton’s presence and they move into contender status….I would consider him elite most definitely, regardless of his pts avg, but if he shoots a good percentage, plays solid D and keeps his assist rate at the same level or above. If Portland struggles with him, then we will have our answer for sure. He is more of a Rod Strickland type……elite numbers, but just below elite level as far as winning.\n\nDo not think he is elite yet, but he could end up being a special player. He is an incredible offensive talent in many ways, probably the best shooting PG after Steve Nash, as far as all things being considered. I think \"elite\" depends on ones definition. Any given game, one of these guys can sneak up on someone else. It is kind of a consistency of such that gives your team an ability that makes their teammates much better than they would be otherwise.\n\nI think that Chris Paul, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Steve Nash, Jason Kidd, Chauncey Billups and Rajon Rondo have fit the bill at one time or another. To me, there are three PG’s who are arguably \"franchise\" type talent, to lead their team to elite status being the times best player or combining with another great talent. They are Chris Paul, Derrick Rose and Deron Williams. John Wall has potential to be one, and Russell Westbrook certainly seems to be doing pretty well.\n\nAll of this \"he can’t be stopped, you can only hope to contain him\" is all well and good, but everyone has bad games and gets outplayed. It is about winning your match-up as much as possible, I suppose. Like, Chris Paul may be the best PG in the game, but he will have games where you will say \"so and so played better\" and have it be true. Does not mean that person is better than Chris Paul on a consistent basis, but it happens. People did a decent job of stopping Derrick Rose in the play-offs, but he is still obviously an elite talent and was the Bulls best player by a long margin.\n\nThere seem to be tiers to each position. If \"Elite\" is the top tier, than I think those three guys I listed as \"franchise\" type talents, stand out more than others. Than you have \"All-Star\" level players, who would be the next category down. After that I guess you have \"Above Average Starter\" than probably \"Average Starter\", I guess starter just probably refers to how many minutes they would play rather than whether or not they start or come off of the bench. I think Raymond Felton is definitely below those first two tiers, and in between above average and average. Stephen is probably one of the higher above average guys, close to All-Star.\n\nUltimately though, their are a lot of players who are pretty close to each other as far as impact. Circumstance definitely plays a part. For instance, how will Rondo look without playing with future Hall of Famers consistently? We don’t know, but he has a very high level of success with them, thus being ranked highly. His circumstance can be held against him, but all in all, his team wins and he plays a huge part. It is difficult to say that there would be too many PG’s doing better than him in his situation. With Felton and Curry, it is really difficult to have the same argument. Even if they obviously are in a different world as far as Rondo shooting the ball, Rondo is much better in other areas. Not to mention, neither Felton or Curry have really been major keys to overly successful teams. I guess I am just trying to make sense of an incredibly broad question without a clearly defined definition to the context. I am confusing myself trying to explain everything, but to the people whose heads I did not go over, think you get my drift.\n\nYou have to define who you see as elite. It obviously is your perception that some players are elite, who are they? Plus, you have to give a better definition than,\n\n\"I don’t care how good a guy is defensively, all you can do is try to slow the person down and minimize how much they contribute.\"\n\n\"You can’t stop him, you can only hope to contain him\" is not something that is easily definable. Who are you saying it about? Who is Raymond Felton better than? Are all of the players I listed in front of him elite as well?\n\nI think consistency also has to be part of the equation. I, for one, feel Joe Johnson is not necessarily elite. He is an All-Star, but I never really fear Johnson and the Hawks as a contender. After a while, you can only blame his teammates so much. He is a tall SG who is quite skilled, but I feel there are more efficient players at his position who are flat out better players. Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade and Manu Ginobili come to mind. I think Eric Gordon is close, if not better as well.\n\nIt is fairly obnoxious to answer a question with a question if you have made absolutely no opinion one way or the other. Yes, highlights are nice, Joe Johnson can do some amazing things. But, the bottom line is being elite is more than just making some nice moves. It is doing it consistently at an efficient rate. Joe Johnson to me is a level below elite. If he is elite, than I think than you would have to include other players who I do not necessarily find \"elite\".\n\nIf you want to know who I feel are \"elite\" or \"franchise\" type players, read this:\n\nhttp://www.nbadraft.net/forum/drafting-franchise-players\n\nTo me, the 10 players I list and the two possibilities are who I would call elite. I could name a few more on the fringe afterwards, but I do not feel there are that many. But, you have to be more specific with who you feel is elite for us to have more of an idea who or what you are talking about to rate Felton accordingly. Right now, you are just throwing words around and using announcer cliches.\n\n@ surve: Think I said I only consider 3 guys elite RIGHT NOW, if you read closely. That list was not of elite players, but guys I felt were better than Felton at this point in time. Was just asking that question so the original poster would maybe give us a more clear definition rather than just throwing \"elite\" around with players putting up decent numbers. Hope that makes sense.\n\nI am not implying that you are wrong in considering him elite, just checking. IMO he is not. Elite to me means a difference maker as the primary focus of a team, be it points, rebounds, assists, blocks….etc. Something a player does well enough to make a difference in winning and losing. Right now, JJ is not in that catagory for me. Just like Chris Bosh was never an elite player in my book either, because he could not make a difference in Toronto. I think we had this same discussion about Vince Carter and his HOF probability. I thought Carter should make it due to his popularity and uniqueness, but I had to concede that Vince was never an elite player….or if he was it was just for 1 season.\n\nJohnson has elite level skills, but if I were to consider him elite, I would have to consider Reke as elite as well. Reke has just as sick handles and puts up just as good or better all around numbers.\n\nMikeyV, I like that word you used….\"FEAR\". you truly fear an elite player. Thats one way of looking at it. I also look at it like this, could I replace JJ with another non-elite player…say like Reke….and get the same results in ATL. If the answer is yes, then in my book he is not elite. Hence my Bosh statement, nobody feared\n\nBosh or the Raptors. Even at this stage you have to fear Kobe. To a degree, you still have to fear Garnett. Dirk, LBJ, Dwade, etc. In actuality, if we are talking fear, I would have to fear Zach Randolph right now more than JJ. I love JJ, but I think the closest player the Hawks have to being elite is Josh Smith. Smith has elite level talent but until the Hawks become a contender, no one on that team can be considered elite in my book.\n\nI actually consider prime Ben Wallace an elite player because of his defensive and rebounding impact….because he was able to make a difference and his team was fearsome, if only defensively."
