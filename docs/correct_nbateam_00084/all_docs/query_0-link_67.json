        "text": "Portland Trail Blazers guard Raymond Felton was recently benched by head coach Nate McMillan after struggling for most of the season. Felton is shooting a career-low 37.1 percent from the field, and has seen his assists drop to a career low (6.2), while his turnovers are at a career high (2.8).\n\nNow, according to HoopsVibe, the Blazers might be discussing a possible Felton deal with the Los Angeles Lakers – a team in desperate need of some help at the point guard position. With Derek Fisher and Steve Blake manning the point in L.A., the team has struggled mightily against opposing guards all season.\n\nReports indicate the Los Angeles Lakers are speaking to the Portland Trail Blazers about Ray Felton, who is upset after losing his starting spot.\n\nDespite his struggles in Portland, Felton might be able to find some success with the Lakers due to the offense they run. Coach Mike Brown runs a high pick-and-roll offense, similar to what Mike D’Antoni runs with the New York Knicks (Felton’s former team).\n\nIf Felton is unhappy in Portland and looking for a change, it would make sense that the Lakers are one of the potential suitors."
