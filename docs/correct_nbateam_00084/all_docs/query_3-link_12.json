        "text": "David Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nPoint guard Raymond Felton reportedly has found a home for his 12th NBA season. According to Chris Haynes of Cleveland.com, citing sources, Felton has agreed to a contract with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nDan Woike of the Orange County Register confirmed the move.\n\nThe Clippers weren't the only team interested in Felton. On July 8, Haynes reported Felton was being pursued by \"approximately five teams.\" Alex Kennedy of Basketball Insiders reported on July 2 that the Pelicans were among those teams.\n\nFelton spent the past two seasons with the Mavericks battling injuries and backing up Deron Williams after a stint as the New York Knicks' starting point guard.\n\nIn 109 games with the Mavericks over that span, he averaged a career-worst eight points and three assists per game, with a 40.6 field-goal percentage and a 28.3 percent success rate from three-point range.\n\nWhen Felton was starting and at his best with the then-Charlotte Bobcats and Knicks, he was capable of putting up 13 to 15 points per night while dishing out five or six assists."
