        "text": "After just completing his second season with the Thunder, point guard Raymond Felton expressed his love of the organization and his time in Oklahoma City on Thursday.\n\nThe 14-year veteran played sporadically this season for the Thunder. With the arrival of Dennis Schroder, many were a bit surprised to see Felton re-sign with the team.\n\nHe began the season as a contributor in the rotation but fell out of favor for most of December and January. By the last few weeks of the regular season, Felton was back playing meaningful minutes.\n\nThe 34-year-old played for most of the playoffs against the Portland Trail Blazers, averaging just 2.2 points in five appearances. He scored a series-high eight points in Game 4.\n\nNow, Felton will become a free agent this summer. After an inconsistent season, it’s unclear how much interest there is from the Thunder to bring him back for another season.\n\nAs Felton said on Thursday, though, he would love to be back in OKC.\n\nI love it here. I love this organization. I love this team. I love this city. I’m a guy at the point of my career like I want to be just settled and just enjoy playing the game that I love, enjoy being in the city that loves me back and loves their team and there is no better place than here. So, yeah, I would love to come back but you know free agency hits and we’ll see what happens.\n\nThe Thunder figure to undergo some minor changes to the roster this summer. As it stands now, there are eight players signed to guaranteed contracts for next season with two players holding options.\n\nThe decision to bring back Felton may very well depend on how other things pan out during the NBA Draft and the free agency period. It seems far too early to determine if Felton will return or not.\n\nFelton certainly adds an element of leadership to the locker room. Most of the players refer to him as Uncle Ray and Felton even mentioned he plans on working with Terrance Ferguson this summer.\n\nWe’ll see if Felton is back for next season in the coming months."
