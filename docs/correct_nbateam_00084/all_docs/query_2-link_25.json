        "text": "[jwplayer TxNvIh4c-z6KDnl0B]\n\nIt has been nearly two weeks since the Portland Trail Blazers dispatched the Oklahoma City Thunder home in the first round of the NBA Playoffs but Russell Westbrook is still very much still with Portland fans.\n\nOf course, the Trail Blazers are now facing the Denver Nuggets in the second round and have battled to a 2-2 series tie after the Nuggets picked up a 116-112 win on Sunday night.\n\nAlthough the Trail Blazers have now moved on, one fan at the Moda Center in Portland brought a sign to the game on Sunday that listed the players apparently not welcomed in the Northwest:\n\nWestbrook and the Trail Blazers have had some heated battles over the years and he was consistently booed in Portland each time he touched the ball in the first round.\n\nIn addition to Westbrook, Raymond Felton also received a healthy diet of boos from Trail Blazers fans. Felton spent the 2011-12 season in Portland and averaged 11.4 points per game.\n\nFelton has since admitted that he arrived that year out of shape and Portland fans noticed. They criticize him for the year he had — both on and off the court — and haven’t let him forget it.\n\nSo, between Westbrook and Felton, and the battles the two teams have had, it is easy to see why the Thunder are not very liked in Portland.\n\nNow, Nikola Jokic joins them on that list, too."
