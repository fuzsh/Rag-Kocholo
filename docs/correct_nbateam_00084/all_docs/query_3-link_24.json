        "text": "The Clippers’ revolving cast of reserves will continue this summer with the likely departure of free agents Raymond Felton, Brandon Bass, Mo Speights and Alan Anderson. If the team is committed to having three max contracts (Paul, Griffin and DeAndre Jordan), it has to have success with its mid-level exception and draft picks to have some bench stability. This is where the team needs to improve the most.\n\nStoryline: Alan Anderson Free Agency\n\n“It’s going to be hard on some of them,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. “The guy that played the minutes before was Austin, he played those (40-minute games). We don’t want to do that. That’s probably why we didn’t play as hard, because guys were playing too many minutes. I think J.J.’s minutes have to go up a little bit, Jamal’s minutes will have to go up because we don’t want to tax Raymond and Austin to the point that they’re not doing what they do well. Raymond’s a great ball pressure guy. If you start playing him 38 minutes, his ball pressure goes down.”\n\nSure, the Clippers were a winning team, but were they a team that liked one another? It was a question Felton knew he’d get a first-hand answer to after signing with the team as a free agent this summer, and the answer wasn’t exactly what he expected. “I didn’t know this team was as close as it is,” Felton said before practice Sunday. “This team is actually pretty close. You hear a lot of negative stuff through the years about this team when you’re on other teams. But being here, this team is actually closer than you think. That surprised me.”"
