        "text": "[img width=\"\" height=\"\" style=\"\" render=\"w620\"]4791924[/img]\n\nWhen you've played long enough to become a 12-year veteran in the NBA, odds are you've had some beef.\n\nRaymond Felton, who the Thunder agreed with on a one-year contract Friday afternoon, has a rich history with OKC.\n\nThe point guard was part of a Denver team in 2011 which thought the Thunder was cocky entering their first-round series. The two teams were division rivals and closed the regular season with two contentious games in a short span. The Nuggets claimed the Thunder was talking serious trash. Then-Denver coach George Karl said \"there's no question there's a cockiness to Oklahoma City.\"\n\nThe heat from the rivalry fired up Felton, who said before the playoffs started he wanted to face the Thunder in the first round.\n\n\"Hopefully we get Oklahoma City because I feel like we owe them,\" Felton said in 2011. \"They were doing a little bit of trash talking, so I want them.\"\n\nWhen Felton went to Portland in 2012, he and Russell Westbrook had some intense battles. It culminated with Felton sounding off after a January game about how Westbrook makes his one-on-one point guard matchups personal.\n\n“That’s the type of guy he is, that’s his mindset, that’s how he plays,” Felton told OregonLive.com when asked about Westbrook's apparent need to win the battle against Felton. “He’s always in a one-on-one battle with all the point guards. I’m not really into that. I’m into winning. If you win, everybody gets the praises. We are not wearing ‘Felton’ on the front of our jerseys; it says Blazers. I care about the Blazers winning.”\n\nOf course, five years is a long time ago. Westbrook has ascended to stardom via that same aggressive mentality. Felton has had success, but is now playing on a one-year, veterans minimum ($2.3 million) contract. The outlook changes significantly, as well, when you're on the same team as Westbrook, who is equally as loyal to his teammates as he is ruthless against his opponents. What Felton showed with Denver, Portland and Dallas (where he averaged 15 points, 4.6 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game in the 2016 Western Conference first round) is there's no back down in him. That'll presumably go over well with Westbrook.\n\nBesides nostalgia, Felton, 33, brings a steady hand to Oklahoma City. Felton has never been a great shooter (41.3 field goal percentage; 32.7 3-point percentage), but he's carried an assist-to-turnover ratio of better than 2-to-1 throughout his entire career, including committing just 1.0 turnover per game last season in 21.3 minutes per game."
