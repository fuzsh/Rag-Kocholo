        "text": "The Trail Blazers not only have a new starting point guard. They just might have a new style of play.\n\nNewly acquired Raymond Felton, an attacking 6-foot-1 point guard, says he is ready to change the pace of the NBA's most deliberate offense by doing what he does best: push the ball up the court and find the open man.\n\nThis isn't the first time in coach Nate McMillan's six years in Portland that a quicker tempo has been predicted, but each time there are pledges or proclamations, the Blazers still rank at or near the bottom of possessions per game.\n\nBut Felton said a recent conversation with McMillan gave him the sense that McMillan is ready to loosen the reins, and let the offense run more freely.\n\n\"We've talked a little bit, and we definitely talked about (the offensive pace),\" Felton said. \"It's something he wanted to change a little bit. I will definitely try to be in his ear, and try to get him to let me do that.\"\n\nSince the Blazers traded Andre Miller to Denver in exchange for the 27-year-old Felton, McMillan said he has had visions of the Blazers becoming less reliant on LaMarcus Aldridge postups and Brandon Roy clearouts. Instead, he sees Felton pushing the ball, while Nicolas Batum, Gerald Wallace and Aldridge – \"runners\" as McMillan called them – streak on the wings.\n\nThe way Felton sees it, a faster pace is playing to the strengths of the Blazers roster.\n\n\"No offense to Andre – he did great here ... but what I'm going to bring that he didn't necessarily do as much is I'm going to really push the ball up the court,\" Felton said Monday, after being introduced along with draft picks Nolan Smith and Jon Diebler.\n\n\"You have a very young, athletic team … guys who want to run up the court and go, and I feel that's something I can bring to the table.\"\n\nA six-year pro, Felton prides himself on being a true point guard, meaning he is a pass-first, score second player. He said that was engrained in him early in his career, when then-Charlotte coach Larry Brown forced him to run polished halfcourt sets. And even though Felton excelled for half a season in New York in Mike D'Antoni's run-and-gun system, a good part of his success was in pick-and-roll execution with Amare Stoudemire.\n\nThe Blazers feel Felton has many of the same intangibles as Miller – durability, toughness and savvy – but has the benefit of being eight years younger while also being quicker and a better outside shooter. The downside is Miller is bigger, gets to the free throw line more, and is one of the best lob passers in the league, which was reflected in the Blazers leading the NBA in alley oops last season.\n\nStill, interim general manager Chad Buchanan says he believes Felton is on an upward trend, as he has improved in each of his six NBA seasons after being the No. 5 overall pick in the 2005 draft.\n\nHerb Brown, a former Blazers assistant who coached Felton for two years as an assistant in Charlotte, said one of the reasons Felton has shown yearly improvement is because of his coachability and his work ethic.\n\n\"He is the consummate professional,\" Brown said. \"He comes to practice everyday and just works his butt off, whether he's hurt or hurting. He has this tremendous desire to get better, and if you suggest something for him to work on, he will work on it relentlessly. He's just an outstanding basketball player and an outstanding human being.\"\n\nFelton grew up in Latta, S.C., a town of about 1,500, and when he signed an NBA contract, he bought his father a car and his mother a diamond pendant and a new home in Charlotte. He also asked both to retire from their jobs. His father – Raymond Sr. – worked in the Russell Stover candy plant and his mother, Barbara, worked in a day-care center. The family kept the home in Latta as a reminder of where they came from.\n\n\"I'm a country boy,\" Felton said. \"What you see in me is a product of where I grew up. It took a lot of hard work and determination to be where I'm at today. You see a kid grow up where I grew up and you wouldn't think it's possible. But I always believed.\"\n\nAnd now he wants to reward the Blazers for their belief in him. Buchanan and McMillan have said they think Felton can be the team's long-term point guard.\n\nHowever, Felton is in the last year of his contract ($7.56 million) and becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer. Last summer, he chose the Knicks over the Blazers because the Knicks could offer more money.\n\nToday, Felton says he will \"strongly\" consider signing with the Blazers next summer. He says he wants a situation where \"the keys of the team\" are handed to him. He didn't say that selfishly, and Brown said Felton is a team-first player.\n\n\"Hey, they already have the core of the team: the All-Stars, the face of the team,\" Felton said referring to Brandon Roy and Aldridge. \"I'm just trying to add a little piece to get this team over the hump.\""
