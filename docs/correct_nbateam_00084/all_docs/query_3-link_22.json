        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — Raymond Felton’s second season in Oklahoma City wasn’t going to look much like his first. He knew that going in.\n\nA trade last summer that moved Carmelo Anthony off the roster and Dennis Schröder onto it meant that the role of Thunder backup point guard would be different. Schröder would log major minutes. Felton likely wouldn’t.\n\nFelton didn’t love the idea, but he accepted it. He welcomed Schröder. And after 14 seasons in the NBA, Felton could see himself in OKC again.\n\n“No question,” Felton said after the season. “I love it here. I love this organization. I love this team, love this city. I’m a guy at a point in my career, like I want to be just settled and just enjoy playing the game that I love and enjoy being in the city that loves me back and loves their team, and there’s no better place than here, really. So, yeah, I would love to come back, but free agency hits, and we’ll see what happens.”\n\nThe hit is less than a month away now, and Felton’s future remains unclear.\n\nWhat’s certain is that in two seasons, he’s found a significant part to play in Oklahoma City regardless of whether he’s getting big minutes.\n\nWhat went right\n\nIn stretches, Felton played a significant on-court role. But his importance to the Thunder extends well beyond it.\n\nAs an established veteran, he’s a key leader in the locker room. Felton’s a fixture in post-practice shooting competitions with Russell Westbrook, Schröder and Paul George, but he’s also an important guide for such young players as Terrance Ferguson and Hamidou Diallo.\n\nFelton loves his locker-room role in Oklahoma City, and though he freely acknowledges that he’d like a bigger one on the floor, he said during the season that he was content with his part to play.\n\nIn February, Felton told The Athletic it was “out of the question” that he’d request a trade, even to a team that might have more minutes available.\n\nDuring that interview, Felton said he kept himself ready in case Billy Donovan “decides to change something up, decides to put me in the rotation,” and for a time he did. In the final six games of the season, Felton averaged 13.3 minutes, scoring 4.7 points per game and shooting 50 percent from 3-point range on 2.7 attempts.\n\nThat stretch was an outlier, but Donovan used Felton more in the second half of the season than in the first. He played in 15 of a possible 34 games from October through February, then saw action in 18 of 32 from February through April.\n\nFelton was eligible to play in 81 games this season — he was suspended for a game in December for leaving the bench area during an altercation between the Thunder and Bulls — and appeared in 33.\n\nA look at Felton’s season shows that his minutes and production were relatively consistent, outside of a shooting surge after a slow start. The only real variable was the frequency of his appearances:\n\nIn his 379 total minutes, the Thunder had a net rating of 1.9. That’s an unspectacular number, but the team didn’t collapse with the 34-year-old on the floor.\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nIt’s no fault of Felton’s, but the Thunder had limited need for him as a backup point guard.\n\nThe trade to acquire Schröder always meant Felton’s role would be reduced or changed, and over the course of the season, both happened.\n\nFelton played 379 minutes, and though the position estimate at Basketball-Reference.com says he spent 63 percent of that time at point guard and 38 percent at shooting guard, he spent much of his time with another point guard on the court.\n\nThe Thunder played limited minutes with all three point guards but frequently featured Felton on the floor with Westbrook or Schröder.\n\nAnd though the sample sizes are small, they indicate Oklahoma City was better when Felton played with another point guard than without:\n\nThat limits how big a part Felton can play.\n\nIn a five-game first-round playoff loss to Portland, Felton played 57 minutes and logged 75 percent of them at shooting guard, according to Basketball-Reference.com, but the postseason was an anomaly.\n\nThe Thunder expected to have Andre Roberson and Alex Abrines. Roberson didn’t return from a ruptured left patellar tendon suffered in January 2018. Abrines missed time with personal issues before he and the Thunder elected to part ways; the team waived him in February.\n\nWhat comes next\n\nAssuming Roberson returns and the Thunder shore up some depth on the wing — a strong summer from Diallo would help — Felton is likely to find only so many available minutes off the ball. And so he and the Thunder have decisions to make.\n\nIs Felton comfortable playing a limited part on the floor? Is he content returning for the league minimum, playing confidant to OKC’s more experienced players and pseudo-coach to its younger ones?\n\nAnd if he is, are the Thunder willing to pay him the minimum rather than use that money in search of a player who might contribute more in the box score?\n\nFelton is well-liked in the organization. He’s a good fit. And if he wants to be back, it means he’s willing to continue sacrificing on the floor to assist off it, and that can be good for a team’s culture.\n\nEven during the season, Felton conceded some conflict. He wants to play, and though the limited opportunities that came with the Schröder trade made sense, they weren’t always easy to accept. The question now is whether he can accept them a second time.\n\n“Is it tough? Of course,” Felton told The Athletic earlier this season. “I want to be out there playing. I still love it. I still got a lot left in me. I still want to play for another two years at a high level. Something like this happens to you, it’s unfortunate. But it’s a great place. I love it.”\n\n(Photo: Wesley Hitt / Getty Images)"
