        "text": "One of the interesting parts of the early season for me has been getting to know Raymond Felton. I still don’t know him very well, but what I do know of him, I like. He’s not especially engaging toward the media – he will seldom, if ever, initiate a conversation – but he is a great quote: He’s honest, straight-forward and interesting. He definitely has a chip on his shoulder, and he seems to be gauging the media cautiously. But he never dodges a question, giving a high-energy, quick-talking, answer. It’s much like his play on the court: fast, aggressive, and seemingly out to prove naysayers.\n\nAnd that’s just fine with the Blazers, the team with the best record in the Western Conference. “Not a lot of people are saying much about Portland,” Blazers guard Raymond Felton said. “They ain’t talkin’ about Portland making the playoffs. I like just where we are. I like us staying under the radar. So we don’t want nobody talking about us on the T.V. Nothing. Even though it’s a little disrespectful, that’s OK. It just fuels us. We are just going to continue to play hard.”"
