        "text": "Following a disastrous season in Portland — during which he was grossly out of shape, and became very unpopular among Blazers fans — Raymond Felton has come in this time with a renewed purpose, and a big chip on his shoulder to prove that he can do just as well (if not better) than Jeremy Lin in New York. Felton admits to the NY Post that he took working out seriously for the first time ever this offseason: “Q: What is a realistic goal for this Knicks team? A: ‘We have a good enough team, we think, to go all the way.’ Q: You think this can be a championship contender? A: ‘Yeah, I do. We have everything. We have depth. we have experience. We got knowledge of the game. We got a great coach and a great coaching staff. We got everything in place. It’s all about us sticking together, staying healthy and continue to get better.’ […] Q: How good a shape are you in now? A: ‘I’m probably in the best shape I’ve been in since college, since the first year I got into the NBA. I feel like I’m back to 21 years old starting off with the Charlotte Bobcats.’ Q: Did you do anything unorthodox training-wise? A: ‘No not really. Probably getting in the weight room, something I never did in my life (chuckle). I did a lot of running … training two times, three times a day … and then I had a great chef on board. I didn’t drink nothing but water for like three months.'”"
