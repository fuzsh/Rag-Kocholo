        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers are benching starting point guard Raymond Felton and replacing him in the starting five with Jamal Crawford, as first reported by The Oregonian today. And now, according to Chris Haynes of CSN Northwest, Felton isn't happy with the move.\n\n\"[Coach Nate McMillan] called me this morning and told me we got to have consistency from that position and that a 7-point quarter was unacceptable,\" Felton told CSNNW. \"I'm not just going to blame myself for that first quarter. We're a team. We win together, we lose together.\"\n\nThe Blazers fell behind 29-7 in the first quarter last night against the Lakers, never catching up and losing 103-92 on the road, their sixth loss in their last nine games. Felton finished with just nine points, plus four assists and four turnovers.\n\nFelton said he'd had a meeting with McMillan last week, and he thought he'd been performing well since.\n\n\"I felt like after the meeting, I did all that I was asked to do,\" he said. \"It's only been two games since then. It's his decision and I'll be the ultimate teammate throughout this process.\""
