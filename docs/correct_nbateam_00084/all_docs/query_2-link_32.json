        "text": "The Knicks and Portland Trail Blazers have completed a sign-and-trade deal that sends Raymond Felton back to New York as a potential replacement for Jeremy Lin.\n\nKurt Thomas, also a former Knick, also returns to New York in Monday's deal. The Knicks signed and traded forward Jared Jeffries, along with center Dan Gadzuric, the draft rights to Kostas Papanikolaou and Giorgos Printezis, and a protected future second-round pick to Portland.\n\nFelton and the Knicks agreed to a multiyear deal Saturday, providing them another option if they decline to match the offer sheet Lin signed with Houston. Felton averaged 17.1 points in 54 games with the Knicks before they sent him to Denver as part of the package for Carmelo Anthony in February 2011.\n\nSurgery set for Irving\n\nCLEVELAND -- Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving will have surgery Wednesday to fix the hand he broke slapping a padded wall during a summer league practice.\n\nThe NBA's rookie of the year broke his right hand Saturday in Las Vegas as the Cavs were preparing for their summer league opener. Irving was upset after making a turnover and hit the padded wall in frustration. The Cavaliers said Irving was seen Monday by team doctors, who confirmed the original diagnosis. Surgery is scheduled for Wednesday at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nThe Cavs estimate Irving will be ready for the start of training camp in late September.\n\nIrving led Cleveland in scoring last season, and recently shined during scrimmages against the U.S. Olympic team.\n\nAround the league\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks have acquired small forward Kyle Korver from the Chicago Bulls for a trade exception and cash. The 6-foot-7 Korver averaged 8.1 points for the Bulls in 65 games, including seven starts, last season. He ranked 10th in the NBA by making 43.5 percent of his 3-pointers. ... The Atlanta Hawks have requested waivers on guard Jordan Farmar, one of five players acquired from the Brooklyn Nets in the deal for All-Star Joe Johnson. ... The Sacramento Kings have signed point guard Aaron Brooks. The Kings also waived center Hassan Whiteside on Monday to clear space for Brooks. ... The Brooklyn Nets have signed veteran swingman Jerry Stackhouse. ... The Sacramento Kings have acquired forward James Johnson from the Toronto Raptors in exchange for a second-round draft pick in 2014. ... The Phoenix Suns have signed first-round draft pick Kendall Marshall to a rookie contract."
