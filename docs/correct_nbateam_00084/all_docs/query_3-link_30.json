        "text": "The Trail Blazers have addressed their needs at point guard.\n\nThe Blazers on Thursday got both experience and youth at point guard, trading Andre Miller to Denver for veteran point guard\n\nand drafting Duke point guard\n\nwith the No. 21 overall pick.\n\nAndy Miller, the agent for Andre Miller, confirmed the trade.\n\nBlazers interim general manager Chad Buchanan did not return messages and scout Mike Born said he would not comment.\n\nDallas is also reported to be in the deal, acquiring Rudy Fernandez and the rights to Petteri Koponen from the Blazers in exchange for their first-round pick (No. 26 overall). Portland will send that pick to Denver.\n\nSmith, a four-year player at Duke, was the ACC Player of the Year, averaging 20.6 points.\n\nThursday accomplishes the Blazers' desire to become both younger at point guard while not sacrificing experience.\n\nFelton, who turns 27 on Sunday, has played six NBA seasons, and is coming off one of his best years playing for both the New York Knicks and the Denver Nuggets. Felton (6-foot-1, 205 pounds) is regarded as a strong pick-and-roll player with below-average outside shooting.\n\nMiller, 35, played two stellar seasons for the Blazers and will head back to Denver, where he played three and a half seasons.\n\nDenver will now assume Miller's contract, which has a team option for $7.8 million that must be picked up before June 30. Felton has one year remaining on his contract, which will pay him $7.56 million.\n\nFelton last season posted career highs in points (15.5) and assists (8.3). He signed a two-year free agent deal before the season with New York, but was included in the Carmelo Anthony blockbuster trade with Denver.\n\nThe fifth overall pick by Charlotte in the 2005 draft, directly behind Deron Williams and Chris Paul, Felton was an All-Rookie second-team selection. He played five seasons in Charlotte, where he is the Bobcats career-leader in assists (2,573). Felton won a National Championship at North Carolina in his junior season, then declared early for the NBA Draft.\n\nLike Miller, Felton has been a durable player, in every season having played in at least 75 of the 82 regular-season games. He also had a career-high 126 steals in 2008-2009.\n\nIf there are two weaknesses to Felton, it is his size – the Blazers posted him relentlessly in a November matchup in New York – and his shooting. He is a career 41.2 percent shooter (Miller was 45.9 percent career shooter), which includes a career mark of 33.3 percent from three-point range. He does, however, pose at least a threat from the outside, making a career-high 116 three's last season, which will help the Blazers' spacing.\n\nOne of the complications with Miller on the Blazers was his poor outside shot, which allowed teams to play off him and clog the middle. Miller made only four three pointers in 37 attempts last season and is a career 20.4 percent three-point shooter.\n\nSmith (6-foot-3, 185 pounds) was a consensus first-team All-American his senior year and helped the Blue Devils win the NCAA Championship his junior season.\n\n\"We've seen him for so long,'' Buchanan said this month after Smith worked out at the Blazers' facility in Tualatin. \"He's just a rock-solid, high-character guy. He's improved at the college level, and he's improved every year, which we like. (He) can score it. Good defender - that was kind of his identity coming into college. He evolved into a pretty good offensive player as well.''\n\nSmith averaged 5.9 points as a freshman, 8.4 points as a sophomore, and 17.4 points as a junior before a stellar senior season when he averaged 20.6 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 1.2 steals.\n\n\"When we grade him out statistically, he grades out very high for us,'' Buchanan said. \"We had dinner with Nolan in Chicago and we think highly of him as a person, too.''"
