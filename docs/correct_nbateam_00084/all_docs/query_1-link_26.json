        "text": "SP.FELT.JPG\n\nRaymond Felton last played in Portland on March 14, 2013, when he was roundly booed by Blazers fans.\n\n(Bruce Ely/The Oregonian)\n\nThe NBA schedule typically produces some oddities, and the 2014-15 gives us this: Raymond Felton, newly acquired by the Dallas Mavericks, will make his season debut in Portland.\n\nFelton joined Dallas as part of the trade that took center Tyson Chandler back to Dallas from New York. Last week, Felton was suspended for the first four games of the NBA season after he pleaded guilty to a firearms charge.\n\nWhen the 2014-15 schedule came out Wednesday, whaddaya know, the fifth game of the Mavericks' season -- the first Felton will be eligible to play as a Dallas player -- will be against the Blazers at the Moda Center on Thursday, Nov. 6. The game will be broadcast by TNT.\n\nFelton, you'll recall, endured some of the loudest, most consistent booing any opponent has ever gotten at what was then the Rose Garden when he returned to Portland as a member of the New York Knicks on March 14, 2013. Portland fans remained unhappy with Felton for his play for the Blazers during the 2011-12 season, when he showed up after the lockout out of shape and did not play well.\n\nLast season, Felton was injured and did not play when New York made its lone Portland visit.\n\nIt remains to be seen where Felton ends up on the Mavericks' depth chart. They traded last year's starting point guard, Jose Calderon, to the Knicks as part of the Chandler deal, then signed veteran Jameer Nelson and re-signed Devin Harris."
