        "text": "Three of any school’s five inductees into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame are from North Carolina, and that number is sure to rise when Vince Carter becomes eligible in 2024. It should come as no surprise that a number of Tar Heels are among the highest paid players in NBA history, having served as a launching pad for some of the best players of all time.\n\nSome of the NBA’s finest ambassadors, including the barrier-breaking Charlie Scott, James Worthy, and Michael Jordan, are inducted into the Tar Heel Hall of Fame. More than any other player in NBA history, Jordan helped establish the league’s current celebrity status among players, reset the compensation structure, and increase the league’s global reach. UNC has the most NBA Championships won by former players of any school, with six rings won by Jordan leading the way.\n\nEight Tar Heels have earned more than $100 million in their careers after accounting for inflation. As one of the rare second round selections to reach the nine-figure milestone, Danny Green was the most recent to cross the highly sought-after threshold (2022).\n\nUNC Basketball: Heels Seeking Big Men Abroad for 2024–25 Season Recruiting Scoop (VIP)\n\nAccording to Spotrac, these are the ten highest-paid Tar Heels in NBA history:\n\n10. RAYMOND FELTON\n\nHeadline/Alt Text\n\nRaymond Felton (Image: Getty/J Pat Carter)\n\nIncome During Career: $53,053,160\n\n$78,077,735 after inflation adjustment\n\nPeak Salary for a Single Season: $8,870,587 (2010–11)\n\n14 years in the NBA\n\nFelton is the only Tar Heel point guard on our list, even though UNC has a long history of producing skilled ball handlers. During his 14-year career, the 2005 National Champion played for seven different clubs after the Charlotte Bobcats selected him with the fifth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. With 971 games played, Felton has amassed NBA career averages of 11.2 points, 5.2 assists, and 3.0 rebounds. Among his accomplishments is the 2005–06 NBA All-Rookie team selection.\n\nOne of the greatest point guards in UNC history, Felton has a career average of 6.9 assists per game, ranking third in program history. Additionally, he tied the record for most assists in a single game in UNC history with 18 in a 2003 game against George Mason.\n\n9. BRENDAN Haywood\n\nBrendan Haywood (USA TODAY Sports photo by Nelson Chenault)\n\nRevenue During Career: $70,312,166\n\n$97,492,140 after inflation adjustments\n\n$8,707,938 was the highest single-season salary in 2011–12.\n\n14 years in the NBA\n\nHaywood, a four-year player at UNC, established himself as a defensive-minded big man in the NBA. After being selected by the Washington Wizards with the 20th overall pick in the NBA Draft, the seven-footer began his career with the organization in 2001. Haywood played with UNC greats Hubert Davis, Jerry Stackhouse, and Michael Jordan during his first two seasons with the Wizards.\n\nHaywood was a proficient shot blocker during his time in the league, averaging more than two blocks per game in two different seasons and more than one block per game in 12 of his 14 years of participation. With 816 games played, he has career averages of 6.8 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks. Haywood was a member of the Dallas Mavericks team that won the 2011 NBA Finals. He played in ninety games (playoffs included), starting eight of them.\n\nHaywood was named to the All-ACC team twice while playing for UNC and was also named to the All-Defensive team once. Haywood finished his time in Chapel Hill with career averages of 10.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game over 141 games played. He scored over 12 points per game in each of his final three seasons there. His UNC record of 304 career blocks stands today. On December 4, 2000, against Miami, he scored the first triple-double in school history with 18 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 blocks (also a UNC record).\n\n8. Danny Green\n\nDanny Green; USA TODAY Sports photo\n\nIncome During Career: $103,403,518\n\n($125,772,293 after inflation adjustment).\n\nMaximum Salary for a Single Season: $15,365,854 (2020–21)\n\n14 years in the NBA\n\nOver the past ten years, Green has become as one of the NBA’s best 3-and-D players, enjoying an uncommon degree of success for a second-round pick. As members of the Los Angeles Lakers, Green and LeBron James became the only players to win a championship with three different clubs, joining John Salley and Robert Horry in that regard after winning the 2020 NBA Finals. In addition, he joins Michael Jordan, James Worthy, and Justin Jackson as the only four UNC players to have won an NBA and NCAA championship.\n\nWith a salary of $15,365,854 in 2020–21, Green achieved a career high; this is a far cry from the $632,445 he earned in his first two seasons combined. Currently a free agent, he has appeared in 13 games over the past two seasons. He plans to make a comeback in 2024–25.\n\nAlong with fellow classmates Tyler Hansbrough, Marcus Ginyard, Bobby Frasor, and Mike Copeland, Green arrived at Carolina in 2005 before making his NBA debut. These players finished their careers with three Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season championships, two ACC Tournament titles, two Final Four appearances, four victories at Duke, the 2009 NCAA crown, and degrees. With at least 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, 200 assists, 100 blocks, and 100 steals during his college career, Green is the only other player on the team. Compared to previous Tar Heels, he participated in more games (145) and won more (123).\n\n7. ERRY STACKHOUSE\n\nStackhouse Jerry (247Sports)\n\nEarnings Over Career: $84,166,865\n\n$137,518,882 after inflation adjustment\n\nMaximum Salary for a Single Season: $11,812,253 (2006–07)\n\n18 years in the NBA\n\nA player of unparalleled excitement in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Stackhouse attained NBA heights never before attained by a Tar Heel since Michael Jordan. Stackhouse led the NBA in scoring (29.8 ppg) in 2000–01 while playing for the Detroit Pistons. He is one of just three Tar Heels to score more than 29 points per game in an NBA season, along with Michael Jordan (nine times) and Bob McAdoo (three times).\n\nStackhouse made history in 2002–03 by being the first Jordan teammate to average more points throughout a full NBA season while playing for the Wizards. Stackhouse made two All-Star selections before retiring at the age of 38. Over the course of 970 games, he averaged 16.9 points, 3.3 assists, and 3.2 rebounds.\n\nStackhouse was a two-year player at UNC who was named to the ACC First Team and the All-America team in his sophomore year. He averaged 8.2 rebounds per game and led the team in scoring that season, helping them reach the Final Four and earn a nomination for Sports Illustrated’s National Player of the Year. After graduating from Chapel Hill, the 76ers selected Stackhouse with the third overall pick in the 1995 NBA Draft. His playing days are gone, but not his lucrative ones. Under his current contract, Stackhouse, the head basketball coach at Vanderbilt, makes almost $3 million annually.\n\n6. Williams, Marvin\n\nMarvin Williams (Image: Getty Contributor/Mike Stobe)\n\nProfessional Salary: $122,709,628\n\n$145,328,472 after inflation adjustment\n\nThe highest single-season salary for 2018–19 was $14,412,197.\n\n15 years in the NBA\n\nAfter a productive 15-year career, Williams retired in 2020 as one of the first stretch-four players in the history of the game. Williams made nearly $100 million as a valuable rotational big man in the 2005 NBA Draft, despite never quite living up to the hoopla surrounding him as the second overall pick among five All-Stars, including Chris Paul.\n\nOver the course of 1072 games, Williams averaged 10.2 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 1.3 assists while playing for four different teams between 2005 and 2020. As a member of the Atlanta Hawks, he had his greatest season in 2007–08, averaging a career-high 14.8 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game. In two different seasons, Williams shot more than 40% from three, and in 12 of his 15 career years, he shot more than 30%.\n\nWilliams was a one-and-done player who never made it to the starting lineup at UNC, but he was crucial to the team’s 2005 National Championship run. Williams participated in all 36 games during that season, going on to win ACC Rookie of the Year with an average of 11.3 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 50.6% field goal and 43.2% three-point shooting. Williams left UNC, but he came back each year until 2014, when he graduated with a degree in African-American studies. In 2022, he worked for the Charlotte Hornets for a short while.\n\n5. Michael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan (Image: NBAE, Getty, Getty)\n\nIncome During Career: $93,772,500\n\n$171,183,337 after inflation adjustment\n\n$53,296,273 was the highest single-season salary (1997–98).\n\n16 years in the NBA\n\nMagic Johnson was making the highest salary in the NBA at the time Jordan joined the league in 1984—$2.5 million. In contrast, Stephen Curry, who earned little over $48 million this season, is the NBA’s highest-paid player.\n\nJordan failed to make more than $4 million in 14 of his 16 NBA seasons and did not make more than $1 million in a season until his fifth year in the league. But the one-year contracts that the six-time NBA Champion signed in 1996–1997 and 1997–1998 brought in a new era of player compensation.\n\nJordan was able to negotiate one-year contracts worth $30.1 million in 1996–1997 and $33.1 million in 1997–1998 thanks to a number of legal maneuvers. At that point, teams could contract or re-sign players for more than the $27.1 million wage cap. The latter $33.1 million pay day remains the greatest single-season compensation in NBA history, even after accounting for inflation.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Jordan has made over $1.3 billion in endorsement revenue from Nike alone over the past 40 years, despite earning pennies on the dollar compared to modern athletes. His Jordan Brand is worth more than $10 billion, and before he sold it for $3 billion in 2023, he made over $300 million as the Charlotte Hornets’ primary owner. With a $3.2 billion estimated net worth, Jordan is the richest athlete in the world. Ion Tiriac, a Romanian tennis and ice hockey star, comes in second with $1.2 billion.\n\n4. ARISTON BARNES\n\nHarrison Barnes (Image: Getty Staff / Steph Chambers)\n\nIncome During Career: $183,158,501\n\nThe highest single-season salary for 2019–20 is $22,638,494.\n\n11 years in the NBA\n\nThe youngest Tar Heel on this list has a chance to finish his career as the highest-paid former UNC athlete in history, depending on how the remaining contracts he signs work out. Prior to the 2019–20 season, Barnes inked a four-year, $85 million contract with the Sacramento Kings, which accounts for the majority of his career earnings. On this ranking, he is the highest-paid Tar Heel who hasn’t yet been selected to the All-Star team.\n\nBarnes has established a reputation as a prolific scorer during his career. During his time with the Dallas Mavericks, he averaged 14.0 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game. In 2016, he set a career-high with 19.2 points per game.\n\nIn the 2012 NBA Draft, Barnes was selected by the Golden State Warriors with the seventh overall choice. He started each and every game as the team won the NBA Championship in 2015. He was traded to the San Antonio Spurs this offseason in a three-team deal after playing with the Kings for the previous six seasons. He joins forces with Harrison Ingram, another Tar Heel.\n\nBarnes, who arrived to UNC as the top player in the class of 2010, played for two years before joining the NBA. Barnes, a two-time All-ACC player, assisted UNC in reaching the Elite Eights consecutively from 2010 to 2012.\n\n3. ANTAWN JAMISON\n\nPhotograph by USA TODAY Sports of Antawn Jamison\n\nIncome During Career: $139,225,261\n\n$216,294,539 after inflation adjustment\n\n$20,242,585, the highest single-season salary (2007–08)\n\n16 years in the NBA\n\nHaving played three seasons at Carolina, Jamison is among the most decorated Tar Heels in history. He won the ACC Player of the Year award and the Naismith and Wooden Awards during his incredible junior year. His No. 33 jersey is retired in the Smith Center rafters and he was a three-time First-Team All-ACC standout. The Toronto Raptors selected Jamison with the fourth overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. On draft day, he was traded to the Golden State Warriors along with fellow draftee and former colleague Vince Carter.\n\nIn five of his 16 NBA seasons, Jamison averaged over 20 points per game. While playing for the Washington Wizards, he was selected to the All-Star team twice. Jamison won NBA Sixth-Man of the Year in his only season with the Dallas Mavericks, 2003–04.\n\nWith career averages of 18.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 1.6 assists over 1083 games played, Jamison retired in 2013–14 at the age of 37. Jamison’s best career year occurred in 2007–08, despite not being his highest scoring season. He averaged a double-double (21.4 points, 10.2 rebounds) and qualified for his second All-Star game. As of right now, Jamison is the Director of Pro Personnel for the Wizards.\n\n2. RASHAED WALLACE\n\nRasheed Wallace (Image: Gary Dineen / Getty contributor)\n\nEarnings During Career: $150,980,511\n\n$257,700,486 after inflation adjustment\n\n$23,857,098 was the highest single-season salary in 2003–04.\n\n16 years in the NBA\n\nWallace is regarded as an NBA Champion, a dominant post player, a fantastic teammate, and possibly the master of technical fouls. Wallace broke his own record of 38 technical fouls the previous season by recording 41 in 80 games during the 2000–01 campaign. Because of his propensity for starting arguments, a rule change that prohibits players from receiving compensation after 16 technical fouls in a season was implemented in 2006. After that, the player is suspended in the same way for each more technical infraction, therefore making Wallace’s record virtually unbreakable.\n\nWallace was one of the top big men in the 2000s and dominated the paint when he wasn’t fighting with the officials. The 6-foot-10, four-time All-Star was a key player on a Detroit Pistons team that stunned the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals. He consistently placed near the top of the league in field goal percentage. Wallace is the only former Tar Heel to make over $23 million in a year (after accounting for inflation) outside of Jordan.\n\nWith career averages of 14.4 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game, Wallace retired in 2012–2013. Throughout his career, he shot 33.6 percent from behind the arc and 46.7 percent from the field on average. Behind Michael Jordan, Vince Carter, Antawn Jamison, Walter Davis, Bob McAdoo, and James Worthy, he is ranked as UNC’s seventh-highest scoring NBA player. Since his retirement, Wallace has started a number of charitable endeavors. He has led multiple community marches, supported an AAU girls team, and contributed money to the Flint Water Crisis.\n\n1. CIRCUM CARTER\n\nVince Carter (Image: Getty Images; Creator: Jed Jacobsohn)\n\nIncome During Career: $171,885,97\n\n$273,524,434 after inflation adjustment\n\n$20,900,422 was the highest single-season salary in 2011–12.\n\n22 years in the NBA\n\nCarter, by far the highest-paid Tar Heel on our list, made an NBA record 22 seasons in the league thanks to his exceptional athleticism and steady three-point shooting. With 1,541 games played, he is third all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish. Carter is in the top 20 highest-paid players in NBA history when taking inflation into account.\n\nWith 25,728 points in his career, Carter is ranked No. 19 all-time in the NBA, second only to Michael Jordan among former Tar Heels. Along with his impressive history, he has won a Slam Dunk Contest, two All-NBA choices, eight consecutive All-Star appearances, and NBA Rookie of the Year awards. Carter, who spent his 22-year career playing for eight different teams, finished at the age of 43 with career averages of 16.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.1 assists.\n\nCarter made his college basketball debut with North Carolina under the famous coach Dean Smith, before going on to shaking the rims in the NBA. Carter attended UNC for three seasons. As a junior, he was a unanimous choice for the second team All-American and was named to the All-ACC in 1997 and 1998. Following an outstanding collegiate career, Carter was traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Jamison after the Golden State Warriors selected him fifth overall in the 1998 NBA Draft."
