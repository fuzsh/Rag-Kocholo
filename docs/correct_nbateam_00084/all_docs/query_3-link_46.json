        "text": "The Thunder are 0-2 this season and have struggled at times.\n\nSo, it shouldn’t be a surprise, then, to hear that the players are not happy with where they are right now after giving up 108 points apiece to the Warriors and Clippers on Friday night.\n\nThe Thunder trailed 16-0 to begin Friday night’s game against the Clippers. However, they eventually went on a run of their own and led the Clippers by as many as seven points in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe team then allowed the Clippers to finish the game on a 27-5 run to seal the 108-92 win as Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallinari each scored 26 points in the game.\n\n“We have to play the same way for four quarters,” Raymond Felton said. “It is game two, we have time to figure it out. We are definitely not satisfied with where we are at right now, we are not satisfied with our play. We are still trying to figure it out. The way we play in the second and third quarter, we have to do that in the first and the fourth no matter what.”\n\nWhile the results certainly haven’t gone the team’s way so far, the players and team also know that they have only played two games and have 80 more to go this season.\n\nThere is still plenty of time to figure things out and they will eventually be getting two starters back this season in Russell Westbrook and Andre Roberson.\n\nThe Thunder are hoping to turn things around on Sunday at home against a 0-2 Kings team.\n\nThe team could even get Westbrook back for that game.\n\nQuote courtesy of Clippers PR."
