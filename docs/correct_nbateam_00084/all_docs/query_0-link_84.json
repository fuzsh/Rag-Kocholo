        "text": "Well, it’s come to this for Raymond Felton. Three and a half years after arriving in New York — the first time — and becoming a crowd favorite, the point guard’s second stint with the Knicks has descended to an all-time low: Amid an injury-marred, slump-filled losing season, Felton was arrested Tuesday morning for gun possession.\n\nHere are some snapshots from the decline of Raymond Felton:\n\nJuly 11, 2010: Signs two-year contract with Knicks for two years and $15.8 million, after spending the first five seasons of his career with the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nOct. 27, 2010: Debuts as a Knick with 15 points and six assists in a season-opening win in Toronto.\n\nNov. 19, 2010: Pours in a career-high 35 points in a road victory over the Warriors, the second game of a stretch in which the Amar’e Stoudemire-led Knicks win 13 of 14 games under Mike D’Antoni.\n\nJan. 7, 2011: Posts his first triple-double (23 points, 11 assists, 10 rebounds) as he continues to thrive in D’Antoni’s offense, working the pick-and-roll with Stoudemire.\n\nFeb. 22, 2011: And just like that, Felton’s first stint with the Knicks ends as he is shipped to the Denver Nuggets in a trade to acquire superstar Carmelo Anthony.\n\nJune 23, 2011: After taking exception to coming off the bench for the Nuggets as Ty Lawson’s backup, Felton gets traded along to Portland on draft day.\n\nDec. 2011: Reports to the Trail Blazers out of shape following the NBA lockout and proceeds to slog through a miserable season in which his scoring dips to 11.4 points and he is jeered at the Portland’s Rose Garden.\n\nFeb. 16, 2012: Hits his Portland low point, going scoreless with five turnovers in 24 minutes. Meanwhile, back in New York, the Knicks’ new point guard Jeremy Lin is at the peak of the city-seizing phenomenon known as Linsanity.\n\nSummer 2012: After the Knicks elect not to match Lin’s poison-pill contract with the Houston Rockets, the team pulls a surprising deal on July 16, acquiring Felton and Kurt Thomas from the Blazers for Jared Jeffries, Dan Gadzuric, the rights to Kostas Papanikolaou and Giorgos Printezis, and a second-round draft pick.\n\nFelton appears on MSG Network during a Knicks summer league game. He announces he’s lost 20 pounds and insists he’s a better point guard than Lin.\n\nDec. 6, 2012: Drops a season-high 27 points in the Knicks’ 112-92 rout of the Heat in Miami, proving to be upgrade over Lin in the first half of the season.\n\nDec. 25, 2012: Breaks a finger in Christmas Day loss to the Lakers and misses a month.\n\nPostseason 2013: Averages over 17 points in an opening-round, six-game series win over Celtics, but he skids against the Pacers, bottoming out with two points in the season-ending Game 6 loss.\n\nSept. 25, 2013: Continues war of words with Blazers and accuses his former team of character assassination. The Blazers respond by posting this on their official Twitter account:\n\nOctober 2013: Suffers a hamstring injury in the preseason that would be an omen of things to come. Injures his groin and hip as the season progresses and he struggles to a career-low 10.4 points a game.\n\nFeb, 20, 2014: Knicks attempt to trade the struggling point guard or at least upgrade the position at the deadline — but could not.\n\nFeb. 21, 2014: Rejects suggestions he is overweight, which plagued him during his troubled stint in Portland.\n\n“Nobody can criticize anything about my fitness,’’ Felton said. “My weight is down. Even lower than it was earlier in the season … I had one year where I was out of [shape]. Now everybody wants to talk about my weight every year. It kind of gets old.’’"
