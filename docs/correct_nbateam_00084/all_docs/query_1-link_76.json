        "text": "With the trade deadline rapidly approaching, the potential trades are getting increasingly numerous. The Lakers, who have been actively shopping since December, have been the focal point of many of these trade rumors.\n\nThe latest rumor comes from CBS Sports’ Ken Berger, who has reported that the Lakers might be interested in Portland Trail Blazers guard Raymond Felton.\n\nRival executives believe the Blazers are interested in exploring a swap of Felton to the Lakers for Steve Blake, with L.A. sending another piece to make the salaries match and compensate the Blazers for getting the better player and future cost savings in the deal.\n\nBlake, who played with the Trail Blazers from 2007-10, is averaging 5.6 points and 3.5 assists for the Lakers this season. Felton, on the other hand, is averaging 10.3 points and 6.2 assists for Portland.\n\n—- Get your Lakers Nation gear and show off your team pride! —-\n\nHowever, the additional player that the Lakers would have to send along with Blake is where things might get tricky. The only players currently on the roster that would solve the potential cap issues are Luke Walton and Josh McRoberts, one of which would be included to make up for the difference in salary between Felton and Blake.\n\nFelton has faced plenty of criticism from the Portland fans and media this season, and even lost his starting position to Jamal Crawford."
