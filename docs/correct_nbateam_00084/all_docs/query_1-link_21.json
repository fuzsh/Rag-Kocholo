(Rocky Widner/Getty Images)\n\nWith Steve Nash no longer an option and Jeremy Lin possibly heading to Houston to play for the Rockets, the New York Knicks are now reportedly \"committed to adding\" Portland Trail Blazers guard Raymond Felton, who played for the Knicks in 2010 under former coach Mike D'Antoni, according to Frank Isola of the New York Daily News:\n\nThe Knicks are favorites to sign Raymond Felton, a source close to the free agent point guard told the Daily News. The Knicks may be willing to acquire Felton in a sign-and-trade as a way to hold on to their $3 million mini-mid level exception to use on another free agent. A trade for Felton would likely include Toney Douglas.\n\nFelton has had a tenuous relationship with the Portland Trail Blazers ever since CSN.com reported in February that Nate McMillian, who was then the head coach, told Felton he'd be benched the next game because of \"unacceptable\" play.\n\nIf the Knicks are in fact able to retain Lin and sign Felton, head coach Mike Woodson would have to decide whether to insert the young but promising Lin into the starting lineup or go with the more seasoned veteran. Felton has been a starter for most of his career since being selected fifth overall by the Charlotte Bobcats in the 2005 NBA Draft."
