        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — These days, Raymond Felton does some of his best work in silence.\n\nBefore the practice court has filled and again after it’s emptied, his Thunder teammates will tell you, Felton is on the floor. At night when the Thunder ION is all but deserted, he’ll find his way back to the practice facility for extra jump shots.\n\n“Practice is over with, most guys go get treatment, go to the weight room; some guys shower and go home,” Felton says. “I’m still here. Got to just put in the extra time, put in the work.”\n\nAt 34 years old and in the twilight of an NBA career that’s spanned 14 years, Felton can’t get by on the minimum requirement. He has to put in overtime when no one’s watching.\n\nSo there’s an irony in the reception Felton will get should he see the court Sunday in Portland, where the Thunder open a first-round playoff series against the Trail Blazers.\n\nIt will be loud.\n\nIt will be unpleasant.\n\nAnd though it will be directed at Felton in the present, it’s intended for a version of him you’d hardly recognize.\n\nThey will boo Felton at the Moda Center. They always do, holding on to bad memories from his forgettable season as a Trail Blazer. Fans hold a grudge because Felton was a disappointment on the court and often surly off it, and because the Blazers acquired him in a trade that included fan favorite point guard Andre Miller.\n\nThey will boo because the perception then was that Felton didn’t work hard enough.\n\nAnd sure, he’d like them to stop, but on that last point, Felton won’t fight them (even though he once suggested a literal willingness to do so; we’ll get to that).\n\n“I was out of shape,” Felton says. “It was a lockout year (2011-12). I didn’t come in prepared. I didn’t come in ready to play. I don’t blame anybody for that but myself. But the anger didn’t come from that.”\n\nFelton felt rage, he says now, because his mother was going through “a very critical moment in her life — she could have lost her life.” And as Felton, then 27 years old, struggled on the court, fans took shots off it, including one on social media that referenced his mother, in language that Felton says made him snap.\n\n“I lost it,” he says.\n\nThat, Felton says, is why he once suggested that his critics could meet him face to face — even telling reporters the building where he kept a luxury apartment in Portland’s Pearl District.\n\n“For somebody to say what they said about her, I lost it,” Felton says. “I think any man would, about their momma. I was young. The way I responded publicly wasn’t the correct way. To this day, I apologize for it. For that statement. Do I apologize defending my mom? No. I would never. But do I apologize for the way I handled it and the things I said? Of course.”\n\nFelton averaged 11.4 points per game as Portland’s starting point guard in that 2011-12 season, the lowest in his career to that point. He dished out 6.5 assists per game.\n\nThose numbers were in keeping with what he’d averaged in 21 games coming off the bench in Denver the season before, but a stark drop from the 17.1 points and nine assists he’d averaged for the Knicks before New York traded him to the Nuggets in February 2011.\n\nThe New York point guard was the guy Blazers fans hoped they were getting.\n\nInstead, they got a version of Felton who’d relaxed during the lockout, who came to camp not ready to play, who bore little resemblance to the hardworking veteran leader the Thunder have come to know.\n\nJason Quick, who now covers the Blazers for The Athletic, wrote after Felton left that he’d “shattered the Blazers’ record for dribbles off his foot in a season” and “almost single-handily torpedoed a well-equipped roster by coming into training camp overweight and out of shape.”\n\nAfter that season, the Blazers traded Felton back to the Knicks, and he arrived for training camp in New York saying he’d lost 20 pounds, further infuriating Trail Blazers fans.\n\nCandace Buckner, then of The Columbian in Vancouver, Wash., wrote upon Felton’s return to play the Blazers that it was “too bad (Felton) completely forgot about the treadmill while living in Portland.”\n\nIn 2016, the fan site Blazer’s Edge celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a list of the biggest Blazers villains in the site’s first decade. Felton finished second, behind only “Knees,” the body part that doomed the careers of Brandon Roy and Greg Oden.\n\nSo, yeah, it didn’t end well.\n\n“It was a bad season for me, man,” Felton says. “I don’t blame nobody but myself. Some things happened, some things were said, and things got a little heated at times. You react and do things as a younger man that you look back and reflect on and say maybe I would have done differently at this point of my career and at this age. But it is what it is.”\n\nFelton has taken something from each of his NBA seasons.\n\nHe took a lot from Portland.\n\nThe hard times taught him something about hard work, and that season spent out of shape with the Blazers helped fuel the guy who puts in extra hours now. Felton’s work ethic and locker-room leadership are why he still has a job with the Thunder, and they’re a big part of how he’s clawed his way back into the rotation after a long absence from it.\n\nFelton played in three games between Nov. 30 and Feb. 9. He played in nine of 10 from Feb. 11 to March 7, then sat in eight of the Thunder’s next 10. But he’s played in each of the Thunder’s past seven games, averaging 4.7 points in 13.3 minutes over the past six. Over that span, he’s shooting 50 percent from 3-point range.\n\nSome of that is attributable to “good matchups,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. But it’s clear that OKC’s fourth-year coach also has some faith in Felton, who can play off the ball in lineups where Russell Westbrook or Dennis Schröder runs the point.\n\n“I have a tremendous amount of confidence in him as a person,” Donovan says. “He’s a high-character guy. He’s a leader. He’s really smart. He’s bright. Very cerebral. Knows the game, has seen a lot of different things.”\n\nFelton is “a professional, regardless of if he’s in the game, if he’s playing or not,” says Jerami Grant, one of those teammates who will tell you Felton is always around, always “getting extra shots up at night.”\n\nThat extra work means Felton could play a part in the playoffs.\n\nIf he does it in Portland, he’ll be met with boos from a fan base that remembers him from a different time in his life.\n\nSometimes, Felton says, he wonders, “OK, how long is this gonna go on?” But the Blazers’ fan fury doesn’t faze him. He’s come to terms with it and calls returning to Portland “bittersweet.”\n\nThe year there was difficult, Felton says, but he made some friends and began a transition into the veteran he’s become.\n\n“I learned a lot,” he says. “I learned something about myself. I had to grow up and mature and be a man. Now, I always make sure I keep myself prepared no matter what. At the end of the day, this is my job. It’s my profession. You don’t do your job, you get fired.”\n\n(Photo: Brad Rempel / USA Today)"
