        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — Wesley Matthews had 25 points, including five 3-pointers in the second half, and the Portland Trail Blazers defeated the previously unbeaten Denver Nuggets 111-102 on Thursday night to stay undefeated after three games this season.\n\nRaymond Felton had 23 points, including a 3-pointer with 1:45 left, as the Blazers pulled away from the Nuggets, who knotted the game at 98 midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nPortland, which opened the season with wins over Philadelphia and Sacramento, led by as many as 13 points in the first half, but the team was plagued by 25 turnovers.\n\nTy Lawson had 25 points and eight steals for the Nuggets. Denver (2-1) was coming off a 117-100 victory over Utah on Wednesday night.\n\nThe two teams traded point guards on NBA draft night in June. The Blazers got Felton, now a starter, while the Nuggets got Andre Miller, who backs up Lawson.\n\nThe Nuggets also have former Blazers guard Rudy Fernandez. The Spanish shooter was traded to Dallas on draft night, then sent to Denver in a deal earlier this month.\n\nNuggets coach George Karl noted Denver’s many connections with the Blazers, including his own friendship with Portland coach Nate McMillan.\n\n‘‘Your enemies motivate you,’’ Karl said. ‘‘But your friends really motivate you.’’\n\nFelton hugged Karl on the court just before the game started, and Miller was greeted with hearty applause when he came into the game midway through the first quarter.\n\nThe Blazers jumped out to a 30-17 lead in the first quarter.\n\nDenver closed to 44-41 on Danilo Gallinari’s dunk with just over four minutes to go before the break."
