        "text": "Raymond Felton ended practice number six of the Trail Blazers season by declaring that he knows very little about the men who preceded him as the point guard of this city's professional basketball team.\n\nHe grew up in South Carolina. He didn't follow the Blazers. In fact, \"as a kid,\" Felton said, \"I didn't even follow the NBA.\"\n\nFelton followed his father -- Raymond Sr.\n\nEverywhere.\n\n\"I watched his game, and watched him play pickup games, and I can say I didn't pattern my game after anyone but my father,\" Raymond Jr. said. The two were inseparable. And you should know that the two often played one-on-one games when Raymond Jr. was a kid, but all that ended as soon as the son hit high school.\n\nRaymond Jr. said: \"As soon as I could win, dad wouldn't play me anymore.\"\n\nSo another season is about to begin in Portland. And I spent a few minutes talking with Felton on Saturday. Not because he's the point guard. Not because he's new. Not because I expect he'll be the most fascinating element in the team's projected starting five. Rather, because of all of these things.\n\nAlso, because Felton's basketball relationship with his father is something we hear less and less of in NBA circles. Single-parent households, Amateur Athletic Union influence and the specialization of talented players at young ages often leave others mixed in the father-son equation.\n\nFelton understands the value of having his mother and father available to him as a kid. It's why he says if he weren't a professional basketball player, he'd be working with children.\n\n\"I just love kids,\" he said. \"Other than basketball, that's my joy.\"\n\nWhen Felton was in high school, his family lived in a tiny wood-frame house in Latta, S.C., that stood across from a soybean field. A large packaging plant was down the way. And Raymond Sr., known as the best ballplayer in the 1,500-population city, installed a basketball hoop in an unpaved backyard field.\n\n\"Dad and I played there, and I shot there all day and night,\" Felton said.\n\nHis father worked for Russell Stover Candies for more than two decades before he was laid off. After that, dad found a job working graveyard at the packaging plant. If you ask Felton about it, he'll tell you about visiting his father during his shift, seeing dad drenched in sweat, working through the night. The shocked son prayed that one day his father wouldn't have to work.\n\nThat day came when Felton became an NBA player.\n\nHe bought his parents a new home. He moved them. The son felt relieved that he was able to take care of the parents who had done so much for his development.\n\nYou can tell when Felton talks about his father's influence how grateful he is for that relationship.\n\nIt struck me as he stood at the end of a preseason practice, trying to remember Blazers guards that came before him, that even as Felton doesn't know much of the history in Portland, he also doesn't really remind me of anyone.\n\n\"Damon Stoudamire, Jeff McInnis, Rod Strickland, the guys who came long before that,\" Felton said. \"I know guys played here, and they were good point guards, but I didn't see much of them.\"\n\nPortland must have sounded like a faraway place to a kid in rural South Carolina.\n\nOnly basketball, it seems, can serve as a direct bridge between a couple of places like that.\n\nThis is an exciting NBA season that's about to start. The 66-game schedule is going to feel furious. But this Blazers team is interesting, and built experienced and tough. And there isn't a better example of depth than Felton, who stands to have the ball in his hands more than just about anyone else this season.\n\nYou can have Jamal Crawford, the newest new guy. Or take the experience of Kurt Thomas. But I'm most interested this season in following Felton, and seeing what a true point guard, playing in his prime years, looks like in a Blazers uniform.\n\nFelton says he's ready. He's hired a personal chef. He's hired a nutritionist. And Felton loves to talk the science of the game.\n\n\"The key to the pick and roll,\" he explained, \"is moving slow while the game is moving fast all around you.\"\n\nFelton said it took him five years in the NBA to understand this, with Larry Brown as his mentor.\n\nBut that it also was drilled into him, too, first by his father in those pickup games and backyard shooting sessions.\n\nI know we'll see Raymond Jr. out there this season. But if you look deep enough, maybe you'll see dad, too.\n\n--"
