We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of Spencer Bennett, who departed from his loved ones on March 23, 2024. Born on May 30, 1965, Spencer was a loving and compassionate husband to his wife Sherri. His marriage to her and the birth of his children were the highlights of his life.

Spencer was a light in the lives of all who knew him. With a heart full of love and a spirit of giving, he always sought to help and uplift others. An artist at heart, he found joy in creating and expressing his creativity. He had a passion for tennis, fishing, and cheering on his beloved Dallas Cowboys. Taking care of his yard was one of his favorite pastimes, and he found solace in the outdoors.

Spencer cherished time spent with his friends and family, whether it was traveling, watching TV, or sharing a delicious meal together. His loyal companion, Patrick, a German Shepherd Lab mix, held a special place in his heart. Spencer’s strong faith in God guided him throughout his life, and his belief was unwavering.

He was preceded in death by his Mom, Alice Eldridge; brother, Barry Bennett; and a sister, Dorothy Bennett.

Spencer is survived by wife Sherri Rodriguez, son Trevor Bennett, daughters Nakeia Bennett, Ashlee Bennett, Ambria Bennett, step daughter Jessica Pennington, his siblings, Corretta Young Bennett, Billy Bennett, Helen Bennett, Betty Bennett, Melinda Bennett, Jennifer Bennett, and Christopher Bennett; nieces and nephews, Latonya Bennett, Omega Bennett, Ashley Bennett, James Bennett, Patricia Bennett, Evan Clerkley, Amaya Bennett, Keisha Gibbs, Terrell Bennett, Andre Bennett, Nelly Bennett, Shanea Bennett, Talia Bennett, Jimon Bennett, Jackie Compton, and Darlene Hall.

A celebration of Spencer’s life will be held at 1:00 pm, Thursday, April 4, 2024, at Wade Funeral Home, in Arlington, Texas, where his loved ones will gather to share stories, memories, and pay tribute to his remarkable journey. Spencer would not have wanted people to be sad and come dressed in black. Please come in bright colors and comfortable clothes to celebrate his life. In his passing, Spencer leaves behind a legacy of love, kindness, and compassion that will forever be remembered by all who had the privilege of knowing him. May he rest in peace.
