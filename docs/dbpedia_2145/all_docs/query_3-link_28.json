        "text": "Dang! How are the holidays almost here?! The passage of time, I guess. Still, I've been staring down this season for quite a while as a social media manager. Good planning and prioritization are KEY 🗝 to anyone working in this field. First, though, hats off 👒 to those of you working in social media that is sales related. Really, this time of year has to be HECTIC. Now for me. I work for a title insurance/settlement company. My priorities a little different. They are: 🎅 Keep a balance of scheduling both holiday and my regular content. 🤶 Make sure to recognize the major holidays celebrated this time of year. Next, let's talk tools. There are few indispensable ones I use that help me save time with content and scheduling. See below: ✨ HeyOrca! Seriously, their scheduling tools and options are fantastic. I have saved so much time since I started using their program. 🎁 Canva I have a lot of graphics to churn out for this time of year. Time saver! 🎀 First American Title has a resource available for my company called Agent Print Pro. They have awesome graphics and resources that come in quite handy for the holidays! 🎉 Google Workspace I love accessing Tasks in my Gmail! I also use Google Docs for outlines and notes. Yes, many social media managers have been planning for this time of year for MONTHS. I have for about a month and a half honestly. I'm even trying out an actual campaign in HeyOrca! in an attempt to get user-generated content. Below, you can see a screenshot of my December schedule. With these tools and my priorities, I'm cautiously ready for the holidays. That being said, are YOU ready? Tell me in comments where you are with your planning! #takebackyourday #holidayplanning #socialemediamarketing\n\nShould you post to Linkedin when on holiday this Summer? ☀️ I studied 20 posts from Linkedin'ers on vacation to find out. 🧐 I make video and graphic design content, so I'm genuinely intrigued how others approach this annual conundrum. I compared the reactions on their posts to those before and after. The results are in, and… Oh. Holiday posts get 2.4x reactions. 🤯 Let’s break that down. Compared to posts AFTER holiday, holiday posts get 2.9x more reactions. Compared to posts BEFORE holiday, holiday posts get 4.9x more reactions. So, what's going on here? From these 20 people, holiday posts are usually a break from the norm. \"...was going to wait until returning to work to post this, but...\" 👆 Holiday posts have some urgency. This post must be super important if they're posting it on their time away! \"...for the first time, I have no worries or concerns about work...\" 👆 Many holiday posts serve as inspiration to others in their network. \"I'm currently on holiday in Tokyo sick as a dog with what feels like the flu, but ain't nothing gonna stop me from publishing my weekly Friday newsletter.\" 👆 and some just scream commitment to their followers. So, to answer the question, YES. It seems posting on LinkedIn on holiday is beneficial. 😮 But, should you? 🤔 Or, a different question: If someone you follow posts “I’m currently on vacation, but...”, should you like their post?\n\nIs Print Still Worth Using? YES! Now I will caveat my comments with admitting that as an owner of a print business I may be biased, but have a read and see what you think. I often read comments along the line of \"I don't send Christmas cards anymore, they are expensive and a waste of time. I send an email and it's just as good…\" I see some of you nodding your heads. But in business isn't standing apart from the sheep and being a little bit different generally seen as a good thing? How many emails do you get per day – 100, 200 or more? How many non-work related emails do you give attention to? How many do you put to one side and look at again at the end of Christmas? How many emails does the decision-maker in a bigger company get? Now let's turn that on its head in today's digital world. How many personalised letters does a decision-maker get in a day? Less than 5? A personalised addressed card is likely to land on the decision-makers desk and be opened by them. It will wind up in their hands with a chance they open and engage with your letter instead of being auto-deleted in one quick swipe or click. When opened it's likely that a nice personalised card will be displayed. At Christmas it's probably going to to be displayed with the one or two others they received. Yours could even be a talking point among other members of the team, as it is unique, personalised and stands out. Come the New Year then it will likely be picked up and looked at again even if it is discarded. The same can’t be said for your email. 7 Reasons to Send Holiday Cards… Add a personal touch during the holidays Spread a little holiday cheer and create goodwill Remind them who you are Create feel-good vibes with your brand Go beyond digital clutter and complacency Rekindle relationships with past clients Say \"Thank You\" after a long year So for this holiday season, try sending a personalised card and connect with clients on a more human level that they will be sure to appreciate. It will help you stand out and shine above the rest!

Which of these ideas will you add to your to-do list? 🤔 Let me know in the comments! 👇 #NetworkingTips #CareerDevelopment #ProfessionalGrowth #BuildingRelationships #NetworkingStrategies #Jobstickers\n\nThis post comes to you from home today and as one that loves my routine, I feel a bit out of sorts. On a normal Monday, I would be at the office. No matter, the post shall go on. It occurs to me that this time of year, some people feel a lot of pressure in celebrating the holidays. From gift giving to showing up at your parent's home, or spending time with family in a new locale. The trouble with the build up is all the pressure we feel to have a \"good time\" and something gets lost. When I was a kid we did get gifts every night for Hannukah, it was usually a combination of stuff I needed like clothes and cool stuff like toys. The older we got, the fewer the gifts, but usually revolved around necessities. I read stories about people putting the holidays on a credit card and letting the chips fall where they may in January. Personally, I don’t recommend that strategy unless of course you’ve budgeted for the holidays, but those of you that haven’t, take note. People will understand if they don’t get the most expensive, or latest gift. Are you really giving your spouse a vehicle this year? My advice is stop watching and listening to ads that make you feel guilty if you don’t buy their stuff. Just decide you are going to do your own thing. If you must, send home made gifts, cookies, a collage of photo’s, a list of things you will do for someone such as clean their garage, or help get rid of unwanted things in their house. I guarantee people will be grateful for the thought. Sometimes visiting someone is enough, they know you care to share an afternoon together, taking them for a walk, or bringing a bouquet of flowers. It is about the thought and care that go into your gifts, not the amount paid. Most people in this country have enough stuff to take care of others and still have more than enough for themselves. Think of how many trees we could save if you simply didn’t order all that stuff online and went to your local gift shop instead. Yes you have to actually get off you hinny drive to the place pick out a gift then deliver it. But you are also patronizing your local businesses, which is helpful to them. We all feel pressure to give gifts, but if you give memories instead, they last a lifetime. Things like a sleighride, an afternoon at the fun park, museum, bowling, mini-golf, building a snowman or snow fort. Or, teaching your kids how to make stuff in a workshop or other crafts. They learn a skill they can be proud of, and now understand how it feels to give of themselves. It becomes a life-long habit. It might be fun to get a thing, but after the excitement is past, the thing may sit on a shelf and not be looked at again until it is time to decide if they want to donate it to charity. Have a great Monday. Glenn The Insurance Recruiter 720-442-8230\n\nGive the Gift of Confidence This Holiday Season: A FREE Professional Headshot! ✨ Ho Ho Ho, friends!

Not enough if you haven’t started planning yet! Yes, that’s right. It’s time to start thinking about Christmas already! While this is my family's favorite time of the year, it’s also the source of a lot of stress on me. One day I’ll figure out how to enjoy it more and reduce the stress. It used to be a whole lot more stressful leading up to and after with the Christmas gift hangover debt. I would pack the schedule and spend way too much money, paying for it for months after the holidays. Not cool, people. Not cool. I started planning early. My goal every year is to have a solid list of gifts by early November so I can start looking for deals and have a rough idea of how much I might spend so I can adjust. My second goal is to be 90% done a few days before Christmas Eve so I can enjoy time with my family and not have the mad dash up until midnight on Christmas Eve. Still working on that… So how do you plan? Write out everyone you want to give a gift to this year. All the family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers, clients and don’t forget the white elephant gifts! Then, start thinking though the events and parties you’d like to attend this year. Saying YES to it all might overstretch your budget, schedule, and leave you feeling exhausted. Look at the calendar and determine which days are not good to attend events and decide on how to say NO. You can also say, “I’m not sure, I’ll get back to you,” and then send a message later with a kind, but firm, NO. Don’t forget about the decorations you’d like to add to your collection, meals you will be cooking or side dishes and anything else that is on the holiday agenda. Need templates?! Got you! I’ve used Busy Budgeter’s Christmas planner in the past, which is very comprehensive and gives you great ideas for gifts and activities that won’t break the budget. https://lnkd.in/evb-HjGz I also came across this super cute template that makes planning quick and easy. https://lnkd.in/ecUg8n8e You Need a Budget (YNAB) also has a template that I plan to use this year! https://lnkd.in/eWzdmDbM Happy Holidays! Too soon? 😉\n\nIt may seem BASIC, but… 💌Keep reading⬇️ for my Top 3 Tips to keeping Birthday Cards budget friendly! “But, Sara, Postage is not cheap!” Indeed, you are correct! Prices on postage have sky-rocketed over the past few years, but with my 3 Marketing on a Budget Tips for Birthday Cards, you will still be able to make someone’s day by sending them a Happy Birthday greeting through snail mail. 🐌 That’s why every business coach in the whole world seems to tell you to nurture your relationships, and I am not going to tell you any different: 1. BE SPECIFIC Pull your list of birthdays for next month and choose the top 2 or 3 most impactful people in your life. Don’t hemm and haw on the decision, your gut will give you the necessary feels to choose wisely. AND by narrowing down your list, not only will you save on funds, you’ll also be updating your database at the same time. 2. BUY CARDS IN BULK I am a huge fan of buying cards whenever I’m out and see designs I love - especially at a great price. I keep them in my office drawer so I’m always prepared for the next round of birthdays - or an impromptu celebration! @traderjoes & @homegoods are 2 of my secret squirrel spots for finding unique & aesthetic varieties of greeting cards. 3. MAKE A PLAN If you plan ahead for the year, you can buy cards in bulk AND buy postage in bulk from Stamps.com or Costco. Plus, planning ahead allows you to budget for this monthly cost while still making an impactful impression on the people who have done the same for you. BONUS: Stay Consistent! I promise you spending TIME nurturing your relationships is worth every second. And every budget-friendly penny. 👑 #beiconic"
