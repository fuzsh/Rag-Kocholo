        "text": "Claudia Davidoff\n\nWhy I Serve JCDS\n\nI believe that JCDS helps kids develop a love of learning and character. Being in a non-judgmental but value-rich environment, they learn respect for diversity.\n\nClaudia Davidoff was born in Mexico City. She came to the U.S. to study Mathematics at MIT, receiving her B.S. degree in 1976. She later trained to be a Montessori teacher for children aged 3-12 years, and in addition, she holds an M.S. in Education from Wheelock College. Visual art has been Claudia's lifelong passion. She earned a Diploma from the school of the MFA but has now retired. She is involved in charitable concerns by serving on the Board of the Friends of the Israel Museum, on the International Board of the Davidoff Center for cancer treatment at the Rabin Medical Center in Israel, and on the Board of the Cambridge Health Alliance. Claudia is married to Joseph Kahan. They live in Cambridge and she and her husband each have two adult children.\n\nGalit Div\n\nWhy I Serve JCDS\n\nJCDS is a special place. I appreciate the way JCDS instills values and habits of heart and mind in their children and the way these values play out explicitly in all studies, becoming part of the natural language of their kids.\n\nGalit Div was born in Israel. She served in the IDF and was part of a prestigious intelligence unit. After the army, she studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she earned her B.Sc.Pharm in Pharmaceutics. Galit also has an MBA from Tel Aviv University in Management and Organizational Behavior. Galit spent over eight years in leadership positions in the pharmaceutical industry in Israel, both in client facing positions and on the manufacturing side. Prior to moving to the U.S., Galit was a Project Manager at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., leading cross-organizational projects in the QA division. Prior to Teva, she managed one of the largest pharmacies in Israel for Maccabi, a leading Israeli healthcare provider. Galit moved to the U.S., following her husband, Lior, as he built up his startup company, Cybereason. Galit and Lior have three beautiful kids: Lia (JCDS '25), Guy (JCDS '27), and Noam (JCP). Galit and her family reside in Newton. They have lived in Boston for six years already, and are very excited to expand their support and involvement within the JCDS community.\n\nRobert Fein\n\nWhy I Serve JCDS\n\nI stand on the shoulders of a giant, my father-in-law, Mervin Gray (z'l). He taught me the importance of respect, inclusion and concern for Klal Yisrael - a core part of the JCDS mission. I also serve in memory of our m'chutenet, Yaffa Korinow (z'l), who loved JCDS with her heart and soul.\n\nRobert Fein is a lawyer by training but has spent most of his career developing and financing high technology businesses. With a partner, he is currently forming a fund/incubator called Eli Broadband Investors. He was previously Vice President of Business Development at Trex Enterprises, the former R&D Center of Thermo Electron, Co-Founder of NewRiver, Inc. (which was sold to Broadridge), Senior Vice President of Finance and Corporate Strategy at PerSeptive Biosystems, and Director of Corporate Strategy at Thermo Electron. In the Jewish world, he was a founding Board Member and Vice President of Development during Gann Academy's first seven years as well as Vice President of Finance; he was also a Board Member at Gateways and a Board Member of the Solomon Schechter Day school of Greater Boston. Robbie and his wife Rena Gray Fein have three children who were graduates of Shechter and Gann Academy. Robbie and Rena's oldest child, Elana Fein is married to her Gann classmate, Doron Korinow. Their oldest, Orly, is a sixth grader, and Meirav is in first grade at JCDS. Their m'chutenet, Gail (Yaffa) Korinow (z'l) was a beloved first grade teacher at JCDS for many years.\n\nRachel Fish\n\nWhy I Serve JCDS\n\nOne of the many strengths of JCDS is its emphasis on, and investment in, the learning process. Teaching our children to learn and appreciate the growth and process of learning—and not only focus on the outcome—is essential at JCDS. Our children experience the educational journey in a profound way with the support and aid of talented educators at JCDS.\n\nDr. Rachel Fish is the co-founder of Boundless, a think-action tank partnering with community leaders to revitalize Israel education and take bold collective action to combat Jew hatred. Boundless is a new nonprofit think-action tank reimagining Israel education and engagement and taking bold collective action to combat Jew hatred across North America. Boundless's goal is to elevate the field of Israel education by working with Jewish leaders and institutions to spark collaboration and innovation, build learning communities, and deliver relevant, resonant content grounded in data and research. Boundless is addressing systems level challenges focusing on four pillars: weaponization of language; building a repository of data; catalyzing collaborations; and enhancing literacy about Israel and Jew hatred.\n\nDr. Fish is a celebrated academic with 20 years of experience in the fields of Israeli history, Zionist thought, and Middle Eastern Studies. Recognized for her teaching prowess and pedagogical approaches, Dr. Fish has published extensively and is frequently called upon to advise on community interventions to reclaim an Israel discourse that is nuanced and complex while remaining accessible to a broad audience.\n\nRobin Friedman\n\nRobin Friedman is an attorney, Jewish community leader, and co-founder of Tribe Talk, an online information hub for Jewish teenagers and young adults designed to bridge the gap between Jewish life in high school and college. As a dedicated community volunteer, Robin works with national and local Jewish communal organizations. She volunteers with Stand With Us, Jewish Family and Children's Services and Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston. She is a former Board member of the Donna Klein Jewish Academy, as well as a past PTO co-President. She has co-chaired the Spirit and Spice series for the Federation of South Palm Beach County, served as co-chair of the Lawyer's Team for Combined Jewish Philanthropies, and is a past participant of the Acharai Leadership Development Program.\n\nRobin concentrated her legal practice in employment law, dealing with issues involving sexual harassment and discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, and national origin. She currently engages solely in pro bono work, most recently representing victims of domestic violence seeking restraining orders. She is a recipient of the Volunteer Lawyers Project Award. She has been published by the Boston Business Journal and quoted by the Boston Globe, and has lectured on the Americans with Disabilities Act, discrimination laws, and sexual harassment. Robin is a graduate of New York University School of Law.\n\nRobin lives in Newton, MA with her husband David and their three sons.\n\nHila Ganor-Schindel\n\nHila moved to Boston from Israel in 2021 with Yair, her husband and their three children Yonatan, Or and Yali who all had a soft and happy landing at JCDS.\n\nShe is a veteran intelligence, market research and strategy professional. Over the last four years she was VP Knowledge and Strategy at Maoz, building the Knowledge Center and supporting Maoz's CEO and the various program managers in serving the network of 800 diverse senior leaders in Israel.\n\nPrior to Maoz, she gained tri-sectoral experience. In the nonprofit sector she consulted nonprofits and philanthropists on strategy and planning and was the Israel Manager for the Jacobson Family Foundation (now One8). In the private sector she was a consultant to Fortune 500 companies at Compete (Boston), an online consumer behavior analytics company and was a research associate at Harvard Business School writing cases in the marketing and market research field. Prior to that, Hila spent eight years in the IDF and Government as an Intelligence officer.\n\nHila is a native Israeli that grew up in Israel, Canada and Australia attending Jewish day schools when abroad and public schools in Israel. Her passion for the Jewish/Israel bridge and understanding of the complexities was shaped growing up.\n\nShe graduated (Summa Cum Laude) in Government and Diplomacy at IDC Herzliya and holds an MBA (Cum Laude) from Boston University.\n\nJoshua Gann\n\nJoshua Gann, known as Josh, has a degree in management and marketing from New York University, and is a graduate gemologist and a third generation owner of Joseph Gann Jewelers in downtown Boston. Josh served as the Va'ad Parent Association co-chair for two years, and was the Shabbaton chair for one year. He also handled the Shabbaton finances for several years. Josh served on the Board of Gann Academy for six years, and was a member of the security and facilities committees. He also assisted Gann in updating the faculty and staff health plans. Josh lives in Newton with his wife, former board member, Nicole, and their three kids: Leah (JCDS '16), Joe (JCDS '19), and Micah (JCDS '24). Josh plays basketball, softball, and attends boot camp twice a week. When he isn't busy making school lunches or every other meal, he avidly listens to Felger and Mazz and various audio books—he really recommends Trevor Noah's, Born A Crime.\n\nNathan Hayman\n\nWhy I Serve JCDS\n\nJCDS teaches students how to think, not what to think. That helps them develop their own Jewish and academic identities in ways that will benefit them throughout their lifetime.\n\nNathan Hayman (Nate) was born in the U.S., but spent half of his life in Israel after his family made Aliyah at age twelve. Since 2008 he has been working at Boston-based Frontier Capital Management as part of the firm's investment team. Frontier Capital is a money management firm that invests approximately thirteen billion dollars on behalf of various institutional clients. Prior to joining Frontier Capital, Nate worked for five years as a commercial lawyer in the Tel-Aviv based law firm Yigal Arnon & Co. Nate has an MBA from the Tuck Business school at Dartmouth and an LLB in Law from Hebrew University. He has three children: Leanne (JCDS '20), Danielle (JCDS '22), and Eli in the sixth grade at JCDS.\n\nAbe Menzin\n\nWhy I Serve JCDS\n\nJCDS is appealing to me because of the values it provides, all within a pluralistic and welcoming environment.\n\nAbe Menzin is Principal and Executive Vice President of development at Samuels & Associates, a Boston-based real estate development and investment firm. Abe manages the development of urban mixed-use projects in Boston, including projects in Fenway and Back Bay and other neighborhoods in the city. Abe has focused his career on developing projects that are located near public transit and that have positive environmental and social impacts. Abe holds an undergraduate civil engineering degree from Tufts University and master's degrees in real estate development and in civil engineering from MIT. He is a member of various housing and economic development committees. While not working, Abe can be found spending time outdoors with his wife Marion and four kids (JCDS classes of '18, '20 '22, and '25). Abe is a passionate advocate for Jewish education and has enjoyed many wonderful experiences as a JCDS parent.\n\nLiz Levin\n\nLiz Levin brings over 25 years of rich experience in Jewish education and language acquisition to her role as the Director of Jewish Life and Learning at JCC Greater Boston. With a background steeped in educational leadership, Liz has directed both formal and informal education programs in the Boston area for over a decade.

They have made some great friends in the last 2 years at JCDS and we are happy to be part of the community.\"\n\nRose-Jane Sulman\n\nRose-Jane Sulman was born in 1948, so she is the same age as Israel, a connection that she has always found joyful. She grew up in Haverhill, Massachusetts. The summer before her senior year in college, she met her husband David. They joined Temple Beth Elohim, sent the children to Hebrew school, and celebrated holidays with their parents, but living Jewishly was peripheral to their lives. When her fourth child started school, she knew it was her time to do what she had always dreamed of doing: become a teacher. In 1991, she received her MAT from Tufts' Eliot Pearson School, and, from the simple need of a job, reluctantly became a second grade teacher at Cohen Hillel Academy in Marblehead. Working at a Jewish day school, a parochial school! was not something she wanted, but working in a Jewish school in Jewish time and Jewish space changed her life. She stayed at CHA for 16 years, and she woke up every day so happy to go to work. She's now worked part time at Maimonides School for the last ten years. Day schools mean everything to Rose-Jane because they changed her life, and she believes they will enrich every child's life, if only they have the opportunity. When her husband died six years ago, she decided to honor his memory by establishing a fund in his name to further science, engineering, and computing education at Jewish day schools. Her hope and belief are that many parents will be drawn to Jewish schools that have stellar and progressive STEM educational opportunities for their children, and once enrolled, their children will receive the Jewish education that will stay with them for their whole lives.\n\n\"Ben Zoma said that a person is rich if he is content with what he has, and I think I finally have reached that understanding. My life is full of my family of four children and their spouses, seven grandchildren, and work that I love doing. I consider myself a very fortunate woman.\"\n\nJaka Saarony\n\nJaka Saarony was born in Western Massachusetts and has since lived in Boston, New York, California and Berlin.
