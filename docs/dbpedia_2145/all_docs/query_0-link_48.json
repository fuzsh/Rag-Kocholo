        "text": "You can learn more about Bay Path University's acquisition of Cambridge College. Sharing a great, informative editorial (https://lnkd.in/eKQvxaQZ) and article (https://lnkd.in/eFh--wTh) from BusinessWest regarding this acquisition. From the editorial: \"...Several acquisition options were considered in several different parts of the country, before Bay Path’s leadership eventually set its sights on Cambridge College, the Boston-based institution created a half-century ago. This acquisition will essentially double Bay Path’s enrollment and take the institution (and probably the Bay Path name itself, although the specifics still must be worked out) to different markets, including Boston and Puerto Rico, where Cambridge has a campus in San Juan that provides graduate programs in business and technology as well as education and counseling to working professionals. It will also allow the school to add another 30 graduate programs to its existing portfolio and better serve the growing Hispanic population — Cambridge is ranked among the best colleges and universities for Latinos. Full integration of Cambridge College into Bay Path will take 18 to 24 months, and it will be interesting to see what the combined schools will look like then. But we expect that this will be another success story for an institution that has written several of them over the past 30 years.\"\n\nIn the spirit of celebrating Black achievements, amplifying Black voices, and reflecting on the process–we are thrilled to present some of the preliminary results of our pilot cohort of OnRamp Scholars! What is OnRamp? Thrive’s program supports the college admission, attendance, and graduation of Scholars identifying as Generational African-American boys in 10th grade, one year before our 6-Year Program starts. We started this program based on the unique needs of Generational African-American boys in college access and success. What did we find? After attending Summer Academy at Amherst College, Scholars' math skills significantly improved–-with an average 219% increase from pre-test to post-test. In addition, the vast majority of Scholars reported that they felt more empowered to navigate their final years of high school. What does this mean? We are encouraged by these initial results and are excited to share more in the coming months about how our Scholars are navigating their junior year of high school to position themselves to succeed in college admissions. We’ll also continue to follow our Scholars’ college journey over time. What’s next? In the coming months, our OnRamp Scholars will finish out their final sessions together and 1:1 with coaching and we will learn about how they’ve succeeded in navigating their junior year of high school to position themselves to succeed in college admissions. Next year, many will continue in our 6-Year Program and we’ll start working with our second cohort of 40 OnRamp Scholars. Check out our report to learn more about the program rationale, design, and initial results. #thrivescholars\n\nThis morning, I had the privilege of attending a Public School Forum of North Carolina work session at The William and Ida Friday Institute for Educational Innovation. I gained insights into the current trends in education across North Carolina. These trends are reflective of many other states in the US and have significant implications for nonprofits, philanthropic agencies, business partners, teachers, and policymakers. Here are some of the key takeaways: 1. Nonprofits and philanthropic agencies are seeking innovation in education but are also skeptical about it. The critical question is whether to fund incremental change or moonshots. 2. Business partners prioritize district partnerships that positively impact communities through internships, certifications, and other application-based approaches to learning. 3. Authentic leadership opportunities for teachers are essential for talent retention, and redefining traditional teacher roles is crucial to position talented people with students. 4. There may be a growing gap between communities in terms of literacy around the opportunities and risks of harnessing generative AI. Intentional stakeholder literacy and early-phase planning efforts can help modulate the tension between untested innovation and outlawing technology. 5. The need for bold, agile education policy seems perpendicular to the current legislative appetite. We must reinforce the expectation that elected officials 'meet in the middle' to lead much-needed change. These trends represent my synthesis of critical trends across North Carolina and the United States. I welcome you to share insights based on issues in your local community. Let's help one another uplift the adage that 'all politics are local' to address these global challenges. Advanced Learning Partnerships, Inc Mary Ann Wolf #EducationTrends #LocalPolitics #GlobalChallenges\n\nToday, Curtis Craig and I dropped a piece in the Star Tribune (to appear in print on Sunday) about where the CEOs of Minnesota's 50 largest public companies went to college. Here's why. Much of American youth culture is oriented towards \"getting into college.\" But very few colleges are hard to get into - the vast majority of colleges accept every applicant that's capable of graduating, which usually means they accept around 70% of applicants. And nationally, that's the average acceptance rate for all four-year colleges. But we worship the totem of selective schools, and when we talk about \"getting into college\" that is, for some, code for \"getting into a 'good' college.\" The most elite schools nowadays accept fewer than 10% of applicants. We thought it was worth taking a step back to ask: what's this for? Do successful people generally go to schools that are hard to get into? Short answer: Not really. Longer answer at the link. If it's paywalled for you, here's some data to chew on. Of the 50 CEOs we looked at, none went to Ivy League colleges, 13 went to highly selective colleges (including one at the Naval Academy), one served in the Marines (Cabell Lolmaugh, CEO of The Tile Shop), six went to schools outside the USA (foreign schools are rarely selective by American standards), and 30 went to state or private universities that generally accept 70% or more of all applicants. The CEOs did tend to go to graduate school, though, and those degrees were often from top programs. Here's a \"gift link\" that should open for everyone: https://lnkd.in/gty5uhuV\n\nFirstly, I want to give glory to God for allowing me to stand here and share my story on this public platform. Ever wondered why Miss Beh hasn't been posting her adventurous educational updates? Well... It's been a challenging six months since I started my educational journey at Hult International Business School. Every day, I've had to put on a positive smile to distract myself from the harsh realities awaiting me at home. Growing up in South London, where 90% of teachers speak negatively about your future, it's been an uphill battle. But I refuse to let statistics define my story. And that determination continues. Being part of higher education full-time, where only 37.5% (Professional HE, 2023) have experienced what I've gone through, has been unforgettable. It's been a constant struggle to assert my rights as a dyslexic, black individual, and more importantly, to find acceptance in companies. These past six months have taught me the importance of being my authentic self. It's about speaking up about uncomfortable truths that often remain unspoken, and it's about living a life that brings about meaningful change and impact. Now, with just two months left, I'm thinking creatively about my educational journey. But I want this to also be a platform for others who aspire to pursue education without the financial burdens that often come with it in our economy. My goals: 1. Raise awareness for master's degree students in need of community support. 2. Encourage companies to be more open to degree students. 3.

Noteworthy highlight of #Purdue and Mitch Daniels as an outlier. #universities #donors #highereducation #tuition \"The problem with a consensus culture, though, is that it makes it easy to avoid difficult conversations and to stumble into groupthink and inertia. One of the few high-profile university presidents with a business background is Mitch Daniels, who retired at the end of 2022 after nine years at the helm of Purdue, a public research university. A former governor of Indiana who had also spent a decade as a senior executive at pharma giant Eli Lilly, Daniels won praise freezing tuition throughout his tenure, during a period when the average college tuition in the U.S. rose 12% a year. Daniels tells Fortune that soaring costs have “really begun to erode” public confidence in the value of college education (a sentiment to which most American families can relate). That inflation, he says, rises from a combination of colleges’ pricing power and their need to satisfy all their internal constituents. College leaders’ instinct is to figure out how much money it will take to keep the various factions happy, he says, “and then turn around and decide, What tuition do we charge to get that amount?” Daniels says his approach at Purdue was to ask harder questions that were more bottom-line-driven and strategic: “What do we need to do to make ends meet and serve our top priorities? … I used to say, ‘To solve the equation for zero, what do we need to do to avoid a tuition increase?’ ” Such a mindset comes naturally to a businessperson. But for now, Daniels’s example is likely to remain an outlier.\n\nIt's been 3 great weeks of leading small group professional development in March for the Black Community Providers Network for Chicago community leaders. I held a small group workshop with 11 leaders under the leadership of BCPN Organizer & retired educator Ms. Mosley from 9:30 a.m.-12 p.m. 📚 Academic Support Workshop Title: Implementing Academic Support in Programs by Implementing Strategies and Best Practices to Empower Students and Families to Soar 📚 Facilitated by Dr. Jarmese Sherrod, President & CEO of S.I.M.P. Inc. & SheWill Legacy NFP 📚 Workshop Description: Regardless of the structure of the program, there are guiding principles that educators should lead when it comes to educating the minds of scholars who will make decisions for our country. In this workshop, participants will learn educational theories, best practices, and how to design programs that employ educational strategies for incorporating tutoring sessions, implementing active learning courses, organizing learning experiences, applying techniques for before and after-school and in school programs, and applying impactful service learning opportunities. These programs and strategies should increase academic achievement of students and provide support to parents who are in need of their children successfully transitioning to their next level of greatness. Objectives 📚 Review and learn how to design programs in your organization to support academic success for K-12th & college/university students 📚 Review educational theories from founders and learn how to apply them for academic support 📚 Reviewing best practices in academic support based on the research that I helped lead with The Partnership for College Completion (PCC), in a grant-funded joint effort with the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB), on its first Faculty Advisory Board Link here: https://lnkd.in/dfebn8yN 📚 Apply fun techniques to celebrate academic support through student & family recognition Participant Key Takeaways Shared 📚 3 Group Teamwork Projects shared with 10/10 scores: Using Partnership to achieve goals, Going above & beyond to support students, and always student-focused & student centered 📚 We need to help the next generations get where they need to be. 📚 It is always an opportunity to help youth, and we need use our resources to do so. 📚Networking is important and has great benefits. 📚We need to use more partnerships to give back.\n\n✒ A glimpse of my recent conference experience with FRANK STRONACH on empowering a prosperous future through creating an ideal society ➕ On March 12th, I had the honor of attending the Dean's Lecture Series where Mr. Frank Stronach, the founder of Magna International & Granite REIT, shared insights from his entrepreneurial journey. Mr. Stronach discussed a roadmap towards an ideal society, emphasizing the statement \"before we achieve the ideal society we'll need to create the ideal man\". He outlined seven strategies to reduce poverty, improve living standards, address the environmental crisis, and enable citizens to pursue happiness on their own terms. For those who are interested, the 7-point program is also available via The Stronach foundation : https://lnkd.in/gwyCi7-6 ➕ Following his presentation, a fireside chat allowed participants to engage directly with Mr. Stronach. Despite the audience's curiosity, time constraints in the agenda limited the number of questions. While I could not get queued to ask about his take on universities' role in crafting a structure for a sustainable and equitable society, Mr. Stronach's remarks however provided an indirect guidance to find the answer for the question at hand. ➕He identifies universities as hubs for innovation, where new ideas emerge to solve problems in a society. That is why the governments often rely on universities for their scholarly expertise and innovative solutions. Mr. Stronach expressed confidence in universities' ability to develop a new blueprint for an ideal society. The society needs technically skilled people in order for the economy to function and the universities have the will and the tools and the resources to make it happen. ➕I believe this statement resonates so much with the theme of our college \"the city is our classroom\" and his speech delivered another big reason for me to strengthen my faith in the process, highlighting the practical, hands-on experiences students gain. Such experiences would indeed enable students to explore diverse career paths, hone their skills, and contribute to the real economy. Besides, my firsthand experience volunteering at events and collaborating with individuals who graduated from George Brown College and are now employed across various industries in GTA has reaffirmed these principles further. I extend my special gratitude to George Brown College Centre for Business | George Brown College,Professor Caroline Williams, M.Ed and Dean Ian Austin for this enlightening opportunity. #gbc #georgebrowncollege #bsb #sports #eventmarketing #businessconference #seminars #empowerher #leadershipdevelopment #athletes #toronto ##deanlectureseries #frankstronach #sustainability #economicdevelopment #innovation #canadaeconomy"
