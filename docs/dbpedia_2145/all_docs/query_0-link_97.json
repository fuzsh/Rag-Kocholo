        "text": "A graduate of Anna Maria College and Georgetown University, Talia grew up in a family with many medical professionals as well as volunteer firemen and knew she wanted to have a career where she could serve others. “I first became interested in this area when I had the opportunity to travel abroad to the Philippines as a student nurse, serving underprivileged mothers on the labor and delivery floor and the obstetrics ward,” she explains. Now a certified Family Nurse Practitioner who focuses on women’s health, Talia believes good communication is always important with patients. “My patients’ well-being is my first priority and I am here to listen to their concerns and to work closely with them to develop the treatment plan that suits them best.”\n\nTalia feels it’s important to establish a strong rapport with her patients. “I like to get to know each of my patients and learn more about their lives so I can offer the best possible care.” She strives to provide her patients with the most up-to-date treatments available. “I like the fact that there are always new developments being made in medicine and that I can incorporate the latest evidence-based research and guidelines into my patient’s care,” she explains. “I also love that I am able to start caring for a patient and continue to grow with them over time, allowing us to build a trustworthy relationship.” In her spare time Talia likes being with family and friends, having weekly game nights and traveling."
