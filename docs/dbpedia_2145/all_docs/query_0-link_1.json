Her father is Kim Bennett and her mother is part Italian.\n\n\"We're all looking forward to following her travels.\n\n\"At the moment we are trying to find something suitable from Te Arawa she can take with her as a gift.\"\n\nMs Bennett, 23, has brains as well as beauty.\n\nShe has a Bachelor of Property degree and is a qualified commercial property valuer. Her interests include yoga, health, nutrition, fashion and tennis.\n\nShe said she was looking forward to representing New Zealand in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate [that Ms Bohm was stripped of her crown] but at the end of the day rules are rules. We want the best girl to step forward,\" Ms Bennett said.\n\n\"So it is unfortunate on her behalf but I'm more than happy to step forward,\" . she said.\n\nShe is the third woman with strong Rotorua or Te Arawa connections to win the national title.\n\nRotorua district councillor Maureen Waaka (nee Kingi) won the title in 1962 and Linda Edward (nee Ritchie) was crowned Miss New Zealand in 1971.\n\nMrs Waaka told The Daily Post Ms Bennett had inherited her sophistication and beauty through her family.\n\n\"I saw her on television and she is a lovely looking girl who is very well spoken. The Bennetts have a long history here and on the coast.\"\n\nMrs Waaka said she wished her all the best for the Miss Universe pageant.\n\nAdditional reporting APNZ"
