        "text": "Cal-bred, Nashville-based dark pop artist Talia Stewart has shared the murderous video for her dark-pop banger, “This Killing Floor,” to announce a mini-EP, ‘Murder, She Wrote’. Even though we heard this song dozens of times we still can’t find the right words to describe its charm. Talia Stewart’s voice is a piece of art, she has one of the best pop voices we’ve ever heard, and her vocal performance in this song is more than professional which how talented she is. The music video is outstanding and will give you a unique experience while listening to Talia Stewart’s charming vocals. The melodies are dark and beautiful, and the lyrics are original and well written. The production of this song is polished and the dark atmosphere is so catchy. We hope you love this banger as much as we do!\n\nWHAT THE ARTIST SAYS ABOUT THIS SONG:\n\nDiscussing the single, Talia states, “‘This Killing Floor’ references a song from Howlin’ Wolf (and later on Led Zeppelin). It is angry and bitter, but also unapologetic and ruthless. It’s about ending a relationship in the bloodiest, goriest way (legit by murder) and not giving a single fuck about it. I remember the day I began writing this song I was so angry my skin felt hot to the touch. I wanted to write a revenge track that was simultaneously a hype-up for myself. I needed to harness my inner Rihanna energy. I remember when Rihanna came out with “Bitch Betta Have My Money” I thought… ‘I have to write a song like this one day’. ‘This Killing Floor’ is my attempt.”\n\nRegarding the video, Talia adds, “Like the song, this video plays on the theme of a relationship ending with the added layer of setting it inside a murder. More specifically though, the video represents my transition as an artist. Me figuratively killing myself represents the transition from my last album cycle, ‘Confessional’, to the current, ‘Murder, She Wrote’. I even wear the same white dress I wore in the visuals for ‘Confessional’, to nail home that theme.”\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST:\n\nTalia Stewart is a dark pop artist from southern California whose vocals bring a distinctive jazz style to her alternative/dark pop sound. Often compared to Amy Winehouse, Talia’s darker sound resonates with fans of Billie Eilish, Post Malone, Kali Uchis, and The Weeknd. In 2015, she moved to Nashville, TN and that same year, she was featured on Taylor Bennett‘s ‘Broad Shoulders’. In 2016, she released her first project, a mixtape called ‘Sin’. In 2018, her single, “Throw It My Way”, released in February and received a placement in the CW television series “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow”. Later that year, her collaboration with Bardo, “Déjame”, landed a placement in the CW series “The Flash”. Her debut EP, ‘Vices and Virtues’ released in 2018. Her follow-up project, ‘Confessional’ released in summer of 2019 and saw the lead single “Look Ma No Hands” go viral on TikTok. Her first single of 2020, “Broken Sinks”, is out now.\n\nFollow Talia Stewart:\n\nSpotify\n\nYoutube\n\nFacebook"
