        "text": "Talia Williams joined the firm in January 2019, after practicing as a litigation attorney at a large firm in Western Mass. Talia has been a lifelong resident of Western Mass and worked in the legal field for nearly ten years in various capacities. Talia attended law school classes at night while working full time as a litigation paralegal. As a result, she developed a unique approach to resolving disputes and a fundamental understanding of the special needs and circumstances of her clients.\n\nTalia’s practice encompasses all areas of civil litigation. She is a member of the Hampden, Hampshire, and Massachusetts Bar Associations and often volunteers in the Hampden County Bar Association – Lawyer for the Day program.\n\nOutside of the office, Talia enjoys hiking, walking with her dogs, reading, crafting, and spending time with family."
